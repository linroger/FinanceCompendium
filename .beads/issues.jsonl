{"id":"PS-1","title":"Epic: Native macOS Python Data Science IDE","description":"**Project goal:**\\n\\nCreate a high-performance, native macOS alternative to Jupyter Notebooks. The app (\"PythonSwift\") allows users to write and execute Python code in a block-based interface, visualize data (plots/tables), and manage files, all within a sandboxed, native SwiftUI environment.\\n\\n**Architecture (sidecar pattern):**\\n\\n*   **Frontend (Swift):** A multi-column SwiftUI app (`NotebookView`).\\n    *   **IPC:** Uses `PythonService` (Actor) to spawn a local Python subprocess (`python_env/bin/python3`) and communicate via JSON-RPC over Stdin/Stdout.\\n    *   **State:** `NotebookViewModel` manages the list of `NotebookCellModel` (Code/Markdown) and syncs variable state with the backend.\\n    *   **Persistence:** Notebooks are saved as `.json` files containing cell inputs and outputs.\\n*   **Backend (Python):** A lightweight script (`server.py`) running in a loop.\\n    *   **Execution:** Uses `exec()` with a persistent `EXEC_GLOBALS` dictionary to maintain state between cells.\\n    *   **Output capture:** Captures `stdout` and `stderr`. Detects `matplotlib` figures and renders them as Base64 PNGs.\\n    *   **Introspection:** `get_variables` method inspects `EXEC_GLOBALS` to populate the Swift-side Variable Inspector.\\n\\n**Current status (MVP complete):**\\n\\n*   ✅ **Execution:** Can run Python code and see text/image outputs.\\n*   ✅ **Plotting:** Matplotlib integration works (renders inline images).\\n*   ✅ **UI:** Native 3-pane layout (Sidebar, Notebook, Inspector).\\n*   ✅ **Persistence:** Save/Load notebooks.\\n*   ✅ **Environment:** Scripts to setup local `venv` with `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`.\\n\\n**Roadmap (next steps):**\\n\\n*   Syntax highlighting (using `Runestone` or similar).\\n*   Interactive DataFrame viewing (native `Table` for Pandas).\\n*   Autocomplete/Intellisense.\\n*   Streaming output for long-running tasks.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-13T21:56:17.061242-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-20T18:41:53.55861-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-20T18:41:53.55861-08:00"}
