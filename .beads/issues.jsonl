Evaluate state management adaptability for cross-platform synchronization. Suggest improvements for more robust state handling, better user feedback on status changes, and alignment with Apple design guidelines. Provide detailed recommendations for implementing Apple-style state management with proper isolation and concurrency.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"swift-implementation-expert","created_at":"2025-12-23T05:51:45.128417-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T05:58:29.001905-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-23T05:58:29.001905-08:00","labels":["analysis","ui/ux"]}
