    "set up beads in this directory and familiarize yourself with this obsidian vault. save whatever insights you gleam to your memory using nornicdb and supermemory mcp. read through the files in @styleguide/ and your subagents dealing with obsdian formatting. there are quite a few of them, so review them all. your task is to parse through the entire vault and create bead issues for each markdown document in the vault instructing an AI cli agent to split the document into small chunks, and to manually read through it iteratively, making sure to identify, assess, address, and fix any formatting issues, or issues with latex equations, or spacing issues or line break issues, or header issues, using the edit tool to make targetted fixes to the parts of the document that contain errors, instead of just rewriting entire chunks of the document, and certainly not relying on scripts or automations that wantonly apply poorly concieved rules that may address the issue in one document, but which may likewise instroduce a host of new errors and formatting inconsistences across the entire vault, especcially given the AI has not even read or touched the other dcuments other than the one they are currently working on. anyways, use insights from the obsidian related skills and subagentts and commands to provide detailed instructions and guidelines for every bead issue, each of which corresponds to a single markdown file in the vault. instrucct the agent to also review the guidelines and details in the @styleguide/ folder, and also pass it further details and guidance and instructions of your own in the beads issues, and instruct the agent also to update the beads issue for the document after each chunk it processed in the document, and log every correction it made, what was the original mistaken formattd, and what the corrections it made and correct formatting that resulted. also instruct the agents to clear the existing tags in the yaml header, and come up with replacement key phrases to add as tags that are highly relevant to the contents of the markdown document, but which are no so specific so as to be singular across the entire vault, such as if it was a specific example rather than a key phrase that can be used to generate internal links across the vault by llinking to other documents.the tags should range from 1 to 2 per document for the smaller documents, to a maximum of 8-10 for the largest documents, with most files having somewhere from 3-5 tags/keyconcepts. also, tell the agent to clean up and fix the formatting of any tables of contents or outlines at the top of documents. anyways, these are just some of the details i want the agent sto pay close attention to when carrying out its task. add these and other details and insights into the beads. remember, under absolutely no condition are scripts or any other automation to be used when carrying out this task by the agent. THis is a high touch, fully manual task that will require the ai to not only read through each chunk of the documents iteratively, feom starr to finish, to understand its content aand use it to generate key phrases to be used as tags. Try to obtain a fairly equal distribution of tags/ key phrases across the markdown document, and don't just get all the tags from the top of th document and none from the bottom. anyways, please get to work creating the beads for each markdown file with all the information and details i provided. ultrathink. an ai cli agent should be able to, in a new session, just review the beads, understand their task fully, and all the details about how it should be executed, with no ambiguity or confusion.
