    "use the skill-development, agent-factory, and skill-development, and obsidian-markdown-formatter skills and @styleguide/obsidian-formatting-instructions.md to come up with a new skill and new agent based on the instructions in the document. this is what i want the agent to do.:[ go look through the open bead issues for a document that no other agent is currently working on and review the instrutions carefully and get to work. update the bead issue with your incremental progress and close it when you finish formatting the document. Make sure to address all the various types of issues and guidelines noted in the document. This is a high touch manual task that will require you to read and comprehend long documents and find and fix the issues noted and make the updates and additions noted in the document. Do not attempt to use blanket scripts or automations that apply changes across an entire document or across documents. Make targetted edits and additions to the documents to fix formatting issues or to add the things mentioned in the formatting instructions. Use the edit tool. then, proceed to the next open bead issue and repeat the cycle. Don\u2019t take any shortcuts and handle each task with the utmost care and attention to detail. Make sure to read the entire document in small chunks iteratively, not just a portion of it. You much read each chunk of the document carefully. I don\u2019t care how long you think it is. You must read the entire document and follow all instructions.]"
