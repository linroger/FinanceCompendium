    "you're workingon beads issue FIN-97047. here was the original prompt: \"ok, go through all the markdown files in my obsidian vaults, located in folderx I to X, recursively, and use regex       \n  search or grep to find all block latex equations, and then run a team of 25 subagents with haiku-4.5 running in          \n  parallel to review and fix any issues with them. each agent should only handle 1 document's latex equations at a         \n  time to prevent overloading, and when 1 is done, spin up another 1 to take its place. look out for issues with           \n  spacing and \\text{} and \\mathrm{} and \\circ and \\bullet, and other formatting issues like spaces between letters of      \n  a word, or issues with superscripts or subscripts, or other issues, and resolve them. do this manually, since this       \n  requires subagents to intelligently understand the equation and what is wrong with it in that specific context. do       \n  not have the agent blindly make edits using blanket scripts over equations it has never seen before. use targetted       \n  edits to fix specific formatting issues. create a new bead issue and provide all the instructions needed for the         \n  subagents, and  make the subagents update the bead issues with documents it has completed already, and also keep a       \n  log document of the documents processed and the specific edits made to incorrect latex equations. you can create a       \n  robust script for the agents to run to quickly capture all the latex equations in a given document. teach the agents     \n  how to use it. additional resources available in the @styleguide/ folder but you only need to pay attention to the       \n  parts regarding latex equation formatting. ultrathink       ok, update the beads issue and note the completed files. then spin up the next round of 25 subagents, and monitor        \n  the progress every 10 minutes or so. im noticing that a lot of the subagents run into the issue where it says            \n  Context low \u00b7 Run /compact to compact & continue. should this be happening if they are only reviewing the latex          \n  equations in a document and not the entire document? whats going on here that is causing the context windows of the      \n  agents to be eaten up so quickly. are they reviewing all the latex equations in their documents, or is their context     \n  window filled up before they can do so? to preserve your own context window, you dont have to review the outputs of      \n  the agents, just keep the beads issues updated if the subagents arent doing so themselves, and spin up new               \n  sibagents whenever one agent is complete. remember to use haiku-4.5 for the subagents.  \" keep working on it. manage your own context window wisely",
