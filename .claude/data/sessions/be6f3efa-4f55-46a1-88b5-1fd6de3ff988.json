Parse through each file and identify the table of contents and the outline of the file. Then, using the outline as your guide, find the chapter breakpoints in the file MANUALLY. Check what comes before and after the chapter breakpoints to make sure you are in the right place. Create a new folder named after The original filename, and then split a copy of the original file into individual chapters, renaming each split file with the chapter name. Make sure that there is not a huge disparity in the sizes of the split files, since that would indicate that the chapter breakpoints are not in the right place. No file should be less than 1kb. Don\u2019t remove the original file. Orchestrate a team of subagents running in parallel to each parse through the files and identify the correct chapter breakpoints and create the split files in the new folders. ",
