# CareerJourney Project Progress Log

## Project Overview
CareerJourney is a macOS/iOS application for tracking job applications. The project is currently in the **Implementation Phase**, following a comprehensive analysis of the skeletal codebase.

## Session Log

### 2025-12-23 - Analysis Phase Completion
*   **Branch**: main
*   **Feature**: Complete Comprehensive Codebase Analysis
*   **Summary**: 
    *   Deployed 15 specialized agents to analyze every aspect of the project (Navigation, Data, UI, Testing, etc.).
    *   Merged all individual reports into a single master document: `CODEBASE_OPENCODE_ANALYSIS.md`.
    *   Identified that the project is in a "Greenfield" state with minimal existing code.
    *   Established a robust roadmap for Phase 1 implementation (Scaffolding, Data Layer, Navigation, MVP Features).
*   **Status**: Analysis Complete. Ready for Implementation.

## Next Steps
1.  **Project Scaffolding**: Set up directory structure and Swift Package dependencies.
2.  **Data Layer**: Implement SwiftData models and services.
3.  **UI Core**: Build NavigationSplitView and main window structure.
