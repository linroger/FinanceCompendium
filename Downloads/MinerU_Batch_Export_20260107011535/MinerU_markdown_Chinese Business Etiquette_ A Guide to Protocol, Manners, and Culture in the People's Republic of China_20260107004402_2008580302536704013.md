In THE DECADE SINCE DEALING WITH THE CHINESE WAS FIRST published, interacting with the Chinese has become increasingly like interacting with nationals from most other countries. As China bounds beadloug into the twenty-first century at a pace hitherto unknown in its history, and sloughs off its Leninist skin for good in favor of its own peculiar coat of "socialism with Chinese characteristics," the influence of the West—in technology, but also in culture and manners—is more and more keenly felt. For example, when Dealing with the Chinese was written in 1988, mainland Chinese really did still refer to each other as tongzhi, which means "comrade." In the late 1990s, by contrast, when this term is employed at all, it is generally used either sarcastically or to describe an old revolutionary who has just died. A decade ago it would have been an unpardonable slight not to send a welcoming party to the airport to receive a visiting foreign business delegation; today, in all but extremely high-level visits, doing this has become the exception rather than the rule. In the first book I warned those hosting Chinese visitors in their home countries to eschew hamburgers and pizza in favor of more Chinese-style fare; this was, however, before the conquest of the People's Republic of China (PRC)

market by McDonalds, Pizza Hut, and Domino's and the ec- nemenal effects they have wreaked on the Chinese palate. None of this means that the old rules no longer govern. The Chinese have not become Americans overnight, nor will they ever become so, no matter how many joint ventures they es

ever become so, no matter how many joint ventures they es- tablish or how many of their children undertake graduate

study in the West. Not even the Taiwanese or the Hong Kong

Chinse, who are arguably two or three decades further along

the Westernization curve than their mainland brethren, have

scrapped their Chinese values, norms, attitudes, or rules of

conduct. What they have done is to adapt to a rapidly change

ing environment. And adaptation generally means changing

not only observable behavior, but, ultimately, also percept

tions, attitudes, and expectations as well.

What all of this does mean is that it is getting raer and raer

to find a Chinese entirely untouched by at least some foreign

values and behavior patterns. It means that fewer people, es

Peeiie urban Chinese, fit old stereotypical profiles, and one

now finds examples—sometimes pervasive, sometimes iso

aated -of Western thinking and behavior in even the most tra

dditional of Chinese people. The truth is, being Chinese is

nervous first-timers enough of a sense of what to expect that they will not be bowled over when they encounter it. It pro

most likely not unique, and certainly not mainly caused by the reader's particularities. But in the end, no matter how many

times we consult Chinese Business Etiquette before, during, or

after an "action" in China, there will be new insights to glcan,

new ideas to share with this lively author and his lively book.

Chinese Business Etiquette will never render itself insolcte.

What this book manages so happily to do is tread the fine

line between necessary generalization and treacherous carica

ture. Americans and Chinese often start with a certain "They

all look alike" approach to one another. It is amusing, if dis

maying, to find generation after generation of well-established

Americans "discovering" that despite names that "sound the

same" and black hair and other shared features, the Chinese

people "aren't all alike after all." The same thing happens the

other way around; I know from experience.

Scott Seligman has studied and lived in China long enough to

distill many of the key shared behavioral characteristics that Chinese people generally display, without falling into overly gross generalizations about "them." China, as anyone who has spent time there knows, has its "ways." The old American pop culture phrase about "Confucius say," despite its racist linguistic parody,

was rooted in a real phenomenon, the fact that China "has an old saying" for just about anyhnman situation imaginable.

The blackboard of Chineseness, in spite of Mao Zedong's

characterization of the impoverished Chinese masses as "poor

and blank," has never been empty. The geographer Rhoads

Mnrphcy, writing three decades ago about the historic dilem

mas of China's modernization, noted that China never snffered

through an identity crisis ("Who are we?") as it faced the unfamiliar.

the contrary, the Chinese never doubted for a moment who they were. The problem of modernity, Murphey noted, sprang

more from the fact that the Chinese, so comfortably rooted in China's still lived culture, have long to live there.

fcats of the nincteenth and early twentieth centuries utterly dis

cordant with the accustomed norms that went with being

Chinese in the first place. Seligman is on solid ground in por

traying widely shared and long-inherited behavioral norms,

rooted in truly ancient Chinese customs and traditions.

While Seligman has excelled in these broad and interpre

tive introductions of essential aspects of contemporary Chinese human relations and behavior, he helps us to understand

that one of those enduring non

power of situational specificity.

Much of what a foreigner encounters in China is neither to

tally standardized cookie-cutter behavior nor the utterly

unique, for-yon-and-you-alone response that Americans raised

on a diet of individual self-expression yearn for when visiting

eleventh day of a three-week visit, someone in the group would look at the fourteen-dish luncheon staring him in the face, suddenly become palc, and announce in a choking voice, "I want a watercrss salad," or "I have got to have a peanut butter-andjelly sandwich or I may lose my self-control." I tricd to reassure the travelers, who usually looked at me with some suspicion, that an incident like this was normal and predictable, but that it would do no good to wallow around in the baths of it. The mini-rebellion against yet another fourteen-dish lun

one's elders is different from that toward one's juniors, that parents must behave "parentally" toward their offspring while their offspring must demonstrate "filial piety" toward their parents, that one's closest loyalties are to close family in all situations. And that, to take the focal issues of Seligman's book, "foreign guests" are to be treated in certain ways because they are foreign guests. In the past, I often briefcd delegations of educated and professionally prominent Americans preparing to visit China for the first time. I found from my own lengthening experience in China that they needed to know the following: On about the

hnman relationships. Notwithstanding the arrival of modern nationalism and Marxist-Lcinitist social revolution in the present century, these norms of human behavior have never been cradicated. And at the center of these norms is the idea that right behavior is situationally appropriate: that proper behavior toward

is what I mean by the power of situational specificity. As Seligman conveys, the core concepts of classical Chinese philosophy, which have percolated down through 2,500 or more years of essentially continuous civilization, revolve around

or working in China. Americans are sometimes dismayed to discover that they are in fact receiving "Foreign Guest/American/Malc/Middle-aged" or "Foreigner/Intellectual/China Novice/Young" treatment by their Chinese counterparts. This

The book is organized according to substantive areas, with

some general discussions of cultural differences and intercultural relationships (Chapters 1, 4, and 7, for example) as well

as specific points relating to important situations such as incident

ings, banquets, gift-giving, negotiations, and hosting. The

most important points to remember about each major topic

are summarized in a recap section at the end of each chapter.

My own credentials for writing this book consist primarily

of experience in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong

that spans twenty-five years, including a total of eight years of

residence in these places. What has always intrigued me most

about the Chinese are the cultural differences between them

and the Westerners with whom they have relationships and do

business. These arc sometimes profound and sometimes triv-

ial, and most often somewhere in between. How we perceive

one another, and how we can learn to bridge the gaps and

communicate clearly, has always held a strong fascination for

me.

One final credential to which I'd like to own up is an abid

ing affection and respect for the Chinese people. I say this not

to warn the reader of a potential bias in favor of the Chinese

in the following pages, but rather to mitigate against what

might otherwise seem at times to be quite the opposite. This

hook may appear in places to be critical of the Chinese and

their practices, and I certainly don't spare them their lumps

when and where I feel they deserve them, for it seems to me

that to do any less would be to write a book that is less than

candid, and hence misleading to the reader. But in truth, I

could not have lasted in this business this long if I were not en

ergized and charmed by my interactions with Chinese people.

I hope this book will help others to feel the same way.

One of the old saws concerning writing about China—at

least China in the late twentieth century-is that the situation

usually changes before the ink has had a chance to dry on the

page. This has been the consistent finding of all who presume

to commit to paper their observations about Chinese politics.

Movements have come and gone with great rapidity in the last

three decades, and no matter what one writes, one's words are

independently overtaken by events. Those who try to provide guid

not inaccurate.

This constant and rapid evolution is much less the case in

the area of culture, protocol, and etiquette, which is considered

nably less vulnerable to the winds of change than business or

politics. China may be changing rapidly, but patterns of inter

action among people have by and large been affected as little or

world as they were by the upheavals of 2,500 years of history.

Beneath a thin veneer of socialist ideology and communist

practice, Chinese interactions are governed by patterns laid in

down and developed through the experience of thousands of

years. Business practices may become more sophisticated, and

material goods may flow in from the West, but the underlying

principles of human interaction tend to be very resistant to

change.

Manners evolve, too, of course, but they do so somewhat

more slowly than other things. And one of the happy characters

how to aet, the Chinese are fond of lecturing one another about what costitutes proper behavior in a given situation. There are relatively few gray areas, even in what is becoming

an increasingly complex society.

This being said, however, it is important to point out that

the Chinese generally hold only other Chinese to all of these

exacting standards. Disparagement that may radily be di

rected toward an erring fellow countryman is not as likely to

be leveled at a foreigner. On the contrary, the body of knowl

The Chinese are probably correct in this last assertion.

THE ADVANTAGES OF LEARNING CHINESE WAYS

Learning Chinese customs is worthwhile for a number of

reasons. First of all, it is useful because imitation is the sinner

a situation provides definite advantages. It's also flattering to

But at the same time, be aware that all Chinese organizations have their own sets of obligations that could lead them to champion their own agendas.

where.

Nowadays it's relatively easy to get a visa to enter China, and

many people come in on tourist visas, without invitations,

even to do business. But if you are visiting by invitation, it is

still generally issued in the name of a Chinese organization.

This nniit—it may be a ministry, a corporation, a municipal or

provincial government, or a travel service—is known as the

host organization, or jiedai danwei.

You no longer need a Chincsc host organization to arrange

for travel within China, book hotels or tickets, or engage in

other routine activities. But they remain very useful in run

ninq interference for you if you wish to do something out of

the ordinary, like arranging a meeting with a state leader or

other high official, a visit to a military installation or to some

other hard-to-get-into place. And the general rule of thnmb is

that the more important the host organization is and the

higher its prestige, the mo

Host organizations are also useful in the early stagcs of eon

# DELEGATIONS

Above all, delegations are expected to act as groups, and not as random collections of individuals. Nothing confuses and

econfounds the Chinese more than many voices in a delegation, each expressing a personal opinion as to what the group should do or where it should go. Since consensus is an important component of Chinese group process, they also expect it from foreigners. The delegation is presumed to speak with

one voice, and it is the voice of the delegation leader.

Some foreign groups lend themselves to this sort of organi

zation more easily than others. Company delegations fit rela

tively easily into the mold, with the senior officer generally

assuming the dnties of the delegation leader. When many dif

ferent companies are represented on a single industrial dele

gation, the choiee may be harder, and in some cases it may

even be totally arbitrary. The selection of the leader is the

province of the gronp members themselves, however; the

Chinesc will not forec their own selection on a group. But if

the identity of the leader is not made explicit to them, they

may make an inappropriate assumption based on title, or even

on a list of delegates they may have received.

You can always tell who it is the Chinese think is in charge.

The person understood to be the delegation leader is the per

son offered the seat of honor to the right at the principal Chi

nese host in a business meeting or a banquet. Apart from

speaking for the group, the delegation leader is also presumed

to be rponsible for enforcing discipline within the group if it

is cver necessary, and for ma

consensns is difficult to reach.

There are other specific roles in a delegation apart from

leadership. When Chinesc travel abroad, one person is often

designated as liaison to the foreign hosts. This may be the in

terpreter, whose linguistic facility makes communication eas

ier, but it may also be someone else. It is, however, always

ECAP: SIX POINTS ON GETTING IN TOUCH 1. The Chinese dislike doing business with strangers; it's

sible about your company and what you hope to accomplish.

3. Business relationships are institutional in nature and arc

not necessarily predicated on close personal tics. It's al

ways a good idea to cultivate personal friends in the bu

reacuracy, however.

4. A host organization is sometimes a helpful thing to have

when one visits China. Such organizations should be se

they have in the bureaucracy.

ested in finding common ground and in learning from you.

The fact that you are a foreigner will generally work in your

favor. With few exceptions, the Chinese have a natural friend

lineess toward foreigners, and a natural curiosity about what it is

is that makes you different from them, though for many the

distinction does not go any deeper than "foreigner" versus

Establishing effective working relations with the Chinese

does not require a mastery of the Chinese language, though

some knowledge of it-even a few well-chosen words-can

generally get you further. The Chinese are flattered when for

or two will certainly earn you high marks. But whether or not

to rattle on in it, though you should be sensitive to the fact that

you may be depriving a Chinese friend of a rare opportunity to

practice English with a native speaker. If, on the other hand,

you have only a few Chinese phrases at your command, it's

best to spare everyone the trouble, especially if your counter

part speaks some English. My rule of thunb has always been

to speak whichever language makes the conversation flow

most easily.

BREAKING THE ICE

The Chinese prefer to be introduced formally to people

they do not know; they are reluctant to strike up chance con

versations with straugers. This goes for fellow Chinese as well

as foreigners. It's for this reason that conservative Chinese tend

to be somewhat uncomfortable attending Western-style cock

tail parties, though these pose fewer problcins for younger

Be aware, too, that the knife cuts both ways. Westerners often do not know what they are doing for their own ends.

Asking a lot of questions about someone's family, for exam-

ple- other than the basics of whether someone is married and

how many children the person has-can be perceived as inappropriate by a Chinese whom you meet in the course of

doing business. Bringing up political issues in such a way as to

make a Chinese feel pressed to express an irreverent personal

opinion is often unwelcome as well. It's safest to steer clear of

politics until you know someone fairly well.

Try complimenting a Chinese on his or her command of the

thing such as "not at all" or "it isn't really very good" in response.

# RECAP: EIGHT REMINDErs ON MEETING AND GREETING

1. Namcs are very important to the Chinese, and you must

ing. Chincsc are seldom called by their given names, ex

cept by close relatives or extremely intimate friends.

2. Chinese surnames coinc first, not last. Call a Chi

person by the surname, together with a title such as Mis

ter or Miss or even Director or Manager. You may also

drop the surname altogether and call the person by the

functional title only.

3. While you can always call a Chinese friend by his or her

name, you might also want to call the friend by the fan

ily relationship that you would have had you been born

into his or ber family, such as dage for an clder male or

xiaomei for a younger female. This goes for the friend's

relatives as well. For his or her parents, use "uncle" and

"auntic."

4. For an especially gracious form of husiness address, drop

the "deputy" in any official's title, and you may also drop

the surname altogether. To call Vicc Minister Li simply

Buzhang, meaning "Miuister," to his facc is to use au ex

5. Formal welcoming parties are sent to airports by the Cbi

this is now seen more in the diplomatic world than the

business world. The rank of the official greeter depends

on the importance of the visitors.

of the role you play in a larger group.

In Imperial China, that larger group would have been one's

counted on to look out for you? Who has never been praised

for standing up for your personal beliefs, especially when the

In essence, Chinese enter into a sort of compaet with their

gronps; in exchange for obedience and loyalty, they can expect

protection and support, and be confident that their well-being

will be a matter of concern to the group as a whole. Group

membership requires discipline: You must subordinate your

own will to that of the whole, and make decisions based not on

personal selfishness, but on the best interests of the larger

group. Chinese people mnst listen to those in authority and do

as they say. And their actions, for good or ill, reflect not only

on themselves but also on all of their compatriots.

# THE DANWEI- THE WORK UNIT

Under orthodox communism, it was the work unit, or danwei, that wielded the most power over an individual's life in

mainland China. Employers in Taiwan and Hong Kong probably hold more sway over the lives of their employees than

those in the West, but they never had anywhere near as much influence as the danwei in the PRC did. On the mainland, the

work unit had a say in just about all major decisions in a worker's life, and in a great number of minor ones as well.

Traditionally, Chinese did not choose their work units; they were assigned to them after they finished their education

through a system that was as inefficient as it was impersonal, since individual preferences were largely irrelevant to the

process. To compound the problem, there was typically almost no job mobility in the PRC. Someconc assigned to be a factory

worker, for example, could for all practical purposes expect to work in the same factory for the rest of his or her working life.

though promotions and job changes within the unit were possihlc, especially for Party members. Switching to another dan

later, through advertising.

much you were paid, and when promotions came; it also controlled where you lived, how much living space you were al

permitted you to purchase certain scarce commodities. At various times in the last fifty years pork, sugar, eggs, salt, grain,

cooking oil, cotton cloth, gas, coal, bicycles, and wooden furniture were all rationed in the PRC. The unit also controlled

Despite this, the control of the danwei diminishes with each passing year. Today there is a great deal of mobility; jobs are advertised and filled by applicants in a more or less supply-and-demand fashion. Parents accustomed to the old system sit in wonderment at the frequent job changes of their children. Employers now retain the right to hire and fire. Subsidies to

access to health care and child care, paid pensions to retired

workers, and enforced the government's one-child policy. This danwei system, which was set up by the communists in

the 1950s, remains today, though in a decided state of decline. As foreign institutions like representative offices, joint ven

tures, and wholly owned foreign enterprises have become em

payers, and as government bnrcancracies have been supplanted by progressive state-owned enterprises and colloc

tive or private employers, the tyranny of the danwei has become more and morc a thing of the past.

One of the functions rctained by the danwei today is to keep custody of an individual's dang'an (filc). The filc is a record of

the individual's life, work, and behavior, and it is necessary for certain functions, especially when the individual wants to

apply for a passport or switch employers, or if he or she gets into trouble with the authorities. Sometimes possession of a

person's dang'an can bc uscd by the danwei for leverage, and there are many examples of universities holding students' files

for ransomwhen the studentsget jobs in the private sector:

The danwei insists on being paid a fee to releasc the file, os-

tensibly to offset the cost of the tuition paid by the government to educate a worker who now will not be serving the state after

all. I know a Chinese who actually asked his danwei to fire him outright so he would not have to pay a "ransom" for his

dang'an.

Despite this, the control of the danwei diminishes with each

passing year. Today there is a great deal of mobility; jobs are

advertised and filled by applicants in a more or less supply-and-demand fashion. Parents accustomed to the old system sit

are generally limited to housing, medical care (which is less and less subsidized), and unemployment compensation. And there are far fewer intrusions into individuals' personal affairs. As enterprises—both foreign and Chinese-owned—grow in importance, the control exerted by the Danwei is quite likely to diminish even further. As far as most Chinese are concerned, it is a case of good riddance.

# CONFLICTSAXA

The position of the individual in Chinese society cannot be fully understood without a discussion of the thought of the sage Confucius (551-479 B.C.) and his disciples, which has exerted a potent influence on Chinese culture through the centuries. Confucianism is actually more a system of ethics and morals than a religion per se, and it stresses the obligations of people to one another as a function of the relationships among them.

who delincate the responsibilities of individuals toward one another based on five important human relationships - those between ruler and subject, husband and wife, father and son, brother and brother, and friend and friend. He advocated a so- cial order that emphasized duty, loyalty, honor, final piety, re- spect for age and seniurity, and sincerity. Such traits remain valued among Chinese the world over even to this day, surviv- ing even a brief period toward the end of the Cultural Rvo- lution when Confucins' teachings were severely criticized on the mainland as feudalistic and counterrevolutionary. Confucins' philosophy can be seen at work in uniyriad ways

China's bureaucracy probably owes as much to its Confu- ment heritage as it does to the Soviet Union, on whose govern- orational organization of communist mythology; it is in fact strictly hi- erarchical, with rank and its privileges defined extremely clearly. People relate to one another not purely as individuals, but rather according to their relative ranks. Decision-making is strictly top-down, and nothing much is accomplished without support from the higher echelons. Personal loyalty is highly valued, and it is common for high-ranking cadres to install crones in important positions under their control.

Confucianism is an inherently conservative belief system. It suffers innovation badly, and does nothing whatever to en- courage it. On the contrary, a hierarchical, vertical system of government in which decisions of even minor import must be referred upward is no crucible for revolutionary change. No one is willing to stick his or her neck out, and so new ground is seldom broken, except by those at the very top. Characteristically, the Chinese bureaucracy is notorious for long delays and nearly imprecise progress. In Confructus' ideal society, each individual occupies his or her proper place-rank is critical, and there is no real equal- ity. In his writings, Confucius spoke frequently of the "superior

man," who embodies a number of virtues, most of which are as highly valued among Chinese today as they have ever been. Traditionally, there are eight such virtues: zhong (loyalty), xiao (filial piety), ren (benevolence), ai (love), xin (trnst), yi (justice), he (harmony), and ping (peace). The superior man embodies all of these in some measure.

The superior man is modest, even so.

erate in habits, generous, and given to compromise and concili

ation rather than direct confrontation. He has no need to parade

his belongings or his accomplishments before others. He is

driven by a well-developed sense of duty. He endeavors to make

others comfortable and is solicitous of guests. He never loses his

balance or his temper, and remains poised no matter what the

situation. A man of integrity, hc overlooks deficiencies in others

and demonstrates honesty and propriety in all of his dealings.

Confucius and all he stood for took a major drubbing in

China during the tumultuous Cultural Revolution period

from the mid 1960s to the mid 1970s, when his teachings were

widely and vehemently criticized as bourgeois and counter-

revolutionary. But since that time there has been a pro

nounced return to Confucian values. The government has

manufactured several propaganda campaigns since the early

1980s, urging people to return to civilized behavior, which to

the Chinese really means Confucian morcs.

In point of fact, although the vice premier had indeed sug

tual invitation had been issued by our host organization,

which interpreted my comments as patronizing.

I was summoned the very next day by the host unit and

summarily dressed down for my perceived offense. I explained

that I had certainly not intended a slight, and to this day bc

Ilieve that my hosts overreacted to the situation. But offense ex

ists in the eye of the beholder, and my intentions were seen as

somewhat less important than my crime. The matter was not

ended to their satisfaction until I wrote a formal retraction,

which of course was a blow to my own prestige. The fact that

I was caused to lose face in the process was of little concern

because I was soon as responsible for the whole situation. Hav

ing delivered the first blow, I apparently had no right to expect

any magnanimity i

indeed, I got none.

The vchemence of the unit's reaction surprised mc, but it

really just underscores how important face is to the Chincsc.

When you cause someone to lose it, you can just about count

on retribution of one type or another. The Chinese do not

often show anger; to do so would fly in the face of the Confu-

cian virtues. They do, however, get even. And while active

confrontation would be viewed as unacceptable behavior on

the part of the superior man, passive aggression is always fair.

The Chinesc, in fact, are masters of the art. It can take differ-

ent forms, but often appears as "inability" to accomplish some-

thing they know you wish to get done, or failure to show up at a

an appointed time with an obviously fabricated excuse. At no

point, however, is etiquette likely to be brached.

The concept of face certainly exists in the West as well, but

My host organization once placed me in the seat of honor next to its chairman during a reception held in Beijing. Though I was flattered by the attention, I did not think much of it until a representative of that organization approached me for a favor a few months later. To ensure my compliance, he was careful to remind me of how much face the unit had accoed me through that action.

that this was not to be a serious match; it had been billcd as

not to the same degree as it does in the East. In the West pro

ple tend to be more willing to forgive slights that cause them

to lose facc. Friendly hazing is, after all, somewhat acceptable

in the Western world. Name-calling, playful dressing down,

and sarcastic commentary may occur, but all is seen as good,

can fun. Such behavior, however, seldom occurs among

Asians, for whom facc is always very serious business.

In English you can lose face and you can save face; in Chi

nesc, however, you can also give face. Giving face means

I'm doing something to enhance someone else's reputation or

is prestige. Complimenting a worker to his or her superior and

publicly recognizing someone's efforts are good ways of giving

face. Thanking someone who has worked hard on a particular

project, even someone of very low rank, is also an excellent ex

ample of this. Such actions carry a great deal of weight among the

Chinese when they come from foreign guests.

My host organization once placed me in the seat of honor

next to its chairman during a reception held in Beijing.

Next to its chairman drawing a reception interview in 2018,

Though I was flattered by the attention, I did not think much

of it until a representative of that organization approached me

for a favor a few months later. To ensure my compliance, he

was careful to remind me of how much face the unit had ac

eored me through that action.

One of my favorite examples of giving face is a volleyball

game in which I once participated at the Chinese Embassy in

Washington. The embassy team played volleyball nearly every

day; it was their chief form of recreation and exercise. The

American challengers, on the other hand, were a picknp team

The second game turned out to be quite the opposite. With

# GUANXI-CONNECTIONS

It's often the case that you can't even get to first base in

China without guanxi, and you can do just about anything

even things you probably ought not to do—when you have it.

Cuaarri really means "connections." It has everything to do

with whom you know and what these people are willing-or

obligated-to do for you

To the Chinese, guanxi is a sort of tif-for-tat. "You scratch

whom you have guanxi can be counted on to do you favors,

tionships as it is in business dealings, and what it means, ultimately, is that the economy of favors between two individuals or units is expected to remain in rough balance over a period of time. Recessivity is the reason Chinese people feel comfortable presuming ou those with whom they have guanxi; if they have done a favor for a friend, they feel they are owed a favor in return.

One corollary to this rule is that Chinese will not only

gladly grant favors to friends who request them, they will

sometimes do favors that are not requested, with the idea that

they can use them to justify payback sometime in the future.

A Westermer I know engaged a Chinese teacher to tutor his

teenage son in music , and did not think much of it when the

teachingson music , and did not think of it when the

teacher began to bring his own son along when he came to the

forcigncr's homc to teach. Thc boys were about the same age,

and the Chinese youth often brought small gifts along. The

# RECIPROCITY

Closely related to the concept of guanxi is that of rcciproc

ity. Many Chinese look at relationships at least partially

through a "What's-in-it-for-me" lens, and friendships are not

necessarily sought exclusively for reasons of personal enjoy

ment. Reciprocity is as mueh a factor in interpersonal rela

Sometimes someone seeking a favor will approach even a

rative stranger with a gift. Though it is seldom stated overtly.

he obvious implication is that accepting the gift means ac

peung an obligation to perform the favor. If you do not wish

to be beholden to such a supplicant, you should decline the

present (see Chapter 9).

The Chinese New Year-called Spring Festival ou the

mainland- is a common time chosen to settle accounts, and

many gifts change hands at this time of the year. People visit

friiiee, cieagues, hossees, and business associates bearing

runt, preserved meats, and other prcscuts that may be very ex

Pensive. Sometimes they are repaying speci#c favors done for

them in the course of the previous year, other times it is more

the future

ple are very much aware of the comings and goings of those around them.

This can be seen as a form of social control, and indeed it

is; suspicious goings-on are noted and sometimes reported to

the authorities. One of the many unfortunate consequences of

the Cultural Revolution, during which people were encour

aged to inform on one another if any bourgeois activities were

suspected, is that many people in China harbor suspicion of

other Chinese they do not know well. Only close friends may

be completely trusted.

Even in apartments or hotels, where foreigners expect to

find privacy, they are often foiled. In Chinese-style hotels, ser

vice personnel are everywhere, and they are easily able to keep

tabs on who comes in, with whom, and when. Hotel staff

sometimes cntcr guest rooms at will, often without knocking

first. This is not a problem in the joint venture hotels, but

there arc still security personnel on hand wherever foreigners

live. Their job is supposedly to prevent theft and keep out

those who have no legitimate business in foreign-rcsident

compounds, but the general consensus among most foreigners

is that security guards are also there to keep an eye on the

and their activities, and to report any suspicious goings-on.

Given the lack of private space, when the Chinese need to

be alone, they often go outside for a walk. There is enough

anonymity in the larger cities, especially after dusk, to allow

people to be apart with their own thoughts. Where the real

problem conics in is when coples wish some privacy for

courting or love-making. So few single people have access to

private quarters that if they can't persuade a roommate to

make him- or herself scarce for a period of time, they, too, will

take to the streets. Public parks in nearly any large city in

# RECAP: ELEVEN POINTS ON CULTURAL DIFFERENCES

1. Chinese are socialized not to question the social order or

try to change it. They submit willingly and relatively un

individuals reflect not only on themselves, but on all of

their compatriots in a group.

A common Chinese criterion of Weslerns is that they

true of the Western view of Chinese. Chinese tend to go all

out for those within their own circles, sometimes putting

themselves at great inconvenience or even in ethically ques

treat strangers almost as if they did not exist. There is a cal-

A further distinction between Western and Chinese points

of view on relationships can be seen in attitudes toward the

family. In the West, family relationships tend to rise and fall for

emotional reasons. If Westerners provide for family members,

it is usually more out of love than out of obligation, especially

when the relationship is a more distant one. Chinese are mo

tivated by emotions, too, but obligations tend to come first,

and it is often more a function of form than content. It is not

unthinkable or even uncommon for a Chinese couple to leave

Couples will even separate and live in different cities; as long

as the family is technically intact, the negative emotional ef

and one's place in the hierarchy directly influences how one

treats others and expects to be treated oneself. The sage Con

fucius, as quoted in the previous chapter, detailed several prin

iciples of behavior that characterize civilized people. But

people tend to be judged less by their depth of understanding

or commitment to these principles than by how well their ob

serving behavior reflects the principles. The importance of

"keeping to the program" was underscored by the sage when

he wrote, in the Analects, "Without an acquaintance with the

rules of propriety, it is impossible for the co

established." That is, manners make the man.

For example, it matters relatively little to a Chinese whether

someone likes or dislikes an aged relative. What is important?

is how well Auntie is actually treated by her family. If she is

alone or infirm, has she been invited to live with vonuger rel.

Foreigners, who do not fit into the Chinese social system,

tend for the most part to be accorded fairly high status by Chinese people, perhaps as a reflection of their standing as guests

in China, or even more likely because they are generally per

ceived as wcl1-to-do. As individuals of high status, they merit

rcspeetful treatment, which many accept as their due when

they are in China, where normal treatment can often be un

pleasant and uncomfortable. This tends to be most true of

Caucasian foreigners and those who come from developed

countries, however, as some Chinese view third-world for

eigners as inferior.

Some foreigners adapt well to this sort of favorable treat

ment based on perceived class; others, particularly Americans,

sometimes find it an affront to their egalitarian sensibilities.

Refusing special treatment generally doesn't work very well,

however, and foreigners who try to ignore class distinctions

often find it frustrating. For example, the business executive

who tries to befriend his driver or his maid may simply wind

up making both of them uncomfortable. The driver doesn't

necessarily desire a greater degree of equality with the boss,

and may he far more relaxed when the foreign boss sits in the

backseat of the car whcrc hcr or shc belongs than when the

boss moves up to the front.

After dealing with the Chincsc for any length of time, you

will probably find that they have some habits that may offend

or puzzle you.

tion, the Chinese conception of the proper social distance between people in a room, or in an elevator, is somewhat closer than that common to many Western cultures, especially America. Don't be surprised if you find a Chinese friend standing a bit too close to you for comfort, touching you, or breathing directly into your face when talking with you. You may even notice that as you step backward to adjust the distance to what you believe is a more suitable level, your Chinese counterpart may advance accordingly. I haven't ever found an effective way to extricate myself from this pas de deux; during conversations with certain Chinese friends I occasionally find myself in more or less coustant backward moiou.

Traditionally, Chinese were seldom demonstrative with

members of the opposite sex in public; even husband and wife

seldom touched when walking together on the street, or else

mae than thia. You may often feel yourself undged through a door or tugged down a street by a Chinese friend. Among the Chinese on the mainland and elsewhere in Asia there is no taboo against this type of contact among people of the same sex, only somewhat Westernized Chinese may feel a bit self- conscious in such situations. And you should also be aware that there are no sexual overtones to this type of physical con- taet among the Chinese.

suckin in of air between clenched teeth. It generally follows a request that a Chinese finds difficult to satisfy. It is used to buy a little time while reflecting, but if you hear it, it's a good idea to jump in and modify or even retract the plea. Not to do so would likely place your Chinese host in the difficult posi- tion of having to say no to you.

nifies reflection and assessment of a situation. In fact, some Chinese accuse Westerners of being far more apt than they themselves to say things spontaneously that turn out to be ill advised or incorrect.

Silence can also be a sign of politeness, a signal that you have the complete attention of your Chincsc listener, who is waiting for you to continue. But it can also be a ploy, used by

Chinese negotiators to buy time and, in so doing, to ferret out the position of their counterparts.

Communication among Chinese is often far more subtle

than it is among foreigners. What is left unsaid is easily as important as what is expressed directly, and silence at a well-

chosen moment can speak volumes. This is not to say that

lengthy periods of no conversation are desirable or even common. To the exteut that they signify that two people are un

comfortable with one another or can't think of things to talk

about, they are of course quite awkward. The natural tendency is to try to make conversation, and the Chinese will do so, too.

Just don't confuse such a situation with one in which someone

is pausing to mull over a point, waiting for someone else to re

spoud to a question, or deliberately not agreeing with a state-

ment that has been made. I learn also to judge whose silence it really is. If you are competent, hold the phone it is his or her

silence, and you need not concern yourself with trying to

break it.

SAYING NO

Refusing a request made by a guest is considered an unac

ceptable form of behavior among Chinese everywhere. Being

turned down to your face causes you to lose face, and no good

Chinese host ever wants to put his guests in such a position.

This is why you should never press a point with your host that

is likely to force him or her to say no. If cornered, Chinese

people will eventually tell you that no is no; they will wonder

all the tinc why you insisted on pressing the point, however,

since the face that is lost in the process is your own.

To save everyone's facc, the Chinese have devised a number

of methods of refusing without actually saying no. The most

common is to say that to grant the wish would be "inconve

"nicnt." Unless you are dealing with a very close friend, don't

take this at face value. But neither should you tak it as a sig

nal to try to convince the host that the obstacles can be sur

mounted and it isn't really as inconvenient as it may seem.

"Inconvenient" may mean that there are political problems as

associated with fulfilling a request that a Chinese would rather

not have to explain fully. Ultimately, in response to a request

or a negotiated demand, "inconvenient" means no, and if

Finally, a Chinese may even tell a lie to avoid saying no or

sone other breach of surface harmony, invcting a story that

has absolutely no truth to it just to get out of the ucomfort-

able position in which he or she feels placed. A colleague of

9. Foreigners can offend Chinese counterparts with physi

cally demonstrative behavior, including touehing Chi

nese of the opposite sex or of advanced age or high rank.

Slinking in one's chair and pointing to objects with a

body part other than one's hands are considered un

couth. Gestures not commonly understood by Chinese

include curling the index finger to signify "Come here,"

shrugging the shoulders to signify "I don't know," and

using several obscene gestures easily understood in the

West.

10. Chinese are far more comfortable with silence than

Westerners. It can be a sign of politeness, signifying that

one is paying attention, but it can also be a ploy to bny

time or draw the other party's position out in a negotia

tion.

11. The Chinese have devised a number of methods of re

handling an ungrantable request is not to deal with it at

seem on the surface. It can be used simply to spare a

guest a loss of face.

I suspected that keeping these audiences indefinite until the last

a feeling of gratitude toward the host organization on the part

of foreign guests, who perceive the hosts as coming through at

way of rewarding foreigners for doing something the Chincse

desire them to do. And they aren't above doing this to cx

tremely high-ranking guests, including foreign ministers and

corporate CFOs.

The good news is that while meetings with government of

fices tend to be crowded and rather dreary places in China, at

least in government buildings, and a small room with several

desks, uncomfortable chairs, and one or two ringing tele-

phones is not considered a fitting place to receive guests. The

fact that stray papers bearing purported state secrets may be

lying around is the ostensible reason many Chinese govern

ment organizations actually prohibit foreigners from entering

working offices.

Most often, meetings are held in rooms furnished solely for

this purpose. They may be located down the hall from the of

fice or in a contiguous building. In government buildings

these rooms are usually fitted out with the ubiquitous over

stuffed chairs and sofas you see throughout China—the same

It is very important to arrive at a meeting on time in the

PRC. Punctuality is considered a virtue on the mainland as

well as in Taiwan, and keeping others waiting is seen as impo

late. If you happen to arrive late to a meeting, be sure to apol

that the driver cruise around the block until the appointed

hour.

Meeting formalities begin with the arrival of the guests at

the site. It is considered important that guests be greeted upon their guests and escorted to the meeting room. The principal

host need not go down to the street to meet the cars, but he or

she should send a representative to do this. It is considered

good form for the host to be in the meeting room waiting

when the guests arrive. The highest-ranking guest should ide

ally enter the room first; if he or she does not, there is a risk

that the Chinese host will mistake whoever does enter first

whether a secretary or a low-level functionary-for the head

person. Chinese delegations tend to enter roous in something

approaching protocol order, with the first- and second-ranking

dclegates leading the way. Only interpreters typically break

rank, since they are necessary to help the leaders communi

cate. So, extrapolating from their own procedures, Chinese

will expect the leader to come in first. But again, in business

# RECAP: A DOZEN NOTES ON BUSINESS MEETINGS

1. Chinese organizations typically request background in

formation before they agre to formal discussions. Pro

provide as much information as possible about the

individuals who will be present, the organization you are

representing, and the topic you wish to discuss, and give

the Chinese side time to study the reqnct.

2. The Chincse dislike surprises, preferring to hammer out

their own positions in advance of a meeting. Knowing

what will he discussed beforehand also permits them to

select the proper participants for a meeting.

3. In China, meetings are generally held in conference

rooins rather than offices. Chairs may line the perimeter

of the room or may be arranged around an oblong table

in the center. Seating is not rigid, but there typically are

designated places for the principals.

4. Punctuality is considered a virtue, so it is important to ar

to the meeting room; bosts are expected to be in place

before gnests arrive.

5. Chinese generally expect foreign delegation leaders to enter a room first, and this prevents confusion. Importantly, the Chinese are more likely to enter a room later.

tant guests are escorted to seats, with the principal guest

placed in a seat of honor. Others may sit where they like.

Chinese meetings begin with small talk. Avoid the temp

tation to lay your cards on the table at first; start out with

icebreakers like general observations or questions.

7. Chinese officials seldom hold solo meetings with for

eigncrs; as a matter of policy, staff members are invari

ably present. Not all participants are necessarily

introduced; those who are not are usually observers or ap-

prentices, however, not decision-makers or active partici

pants.

8. Chincse meetings are structured dialogues between prin

cipals on both sides; others participate in the conversa

tion only upon explicit invitation. The Chinese prefer to

react to others' ideas, and not to bear the onus of setting

the scope of the discussion themselves.

It is the business and professional relationships between

Business relationships generally begin rather formally. Informality is acceptable only after those involved have spent

sufficient time together to know one another well, and even then it has its limits. In such situations, the Chinese don't al

ways say what they mean or what they feel, but try instead to

the most advantage. They deal with foreign businesspeople

less as individuals and more as representatives of their organi

zations.

This is true even in the relatively informal social settings of

banquets. While the Chinese work hard trying to establish

common ground and interests—even personal interests—they

never lose sight of the fact that the reason they are spending

time with you is a professional one rather than a personal one.

If you a

Rank is extremely important in business relationships with

the Chinese. Even though it is sometimes hard to determine

the rank of someone who comes from an entirely different sys

tem, still less to relate it to your own organizational hierarchy,

the Chinese can be counted on to try their best at this. And as

Chinese enterprises move farther away from the Soviet bu

reaucratic model and closer to the Western corporate model,

signals get easier to read on both sides. It's unusual to talk busi

ness with someone who ranks far higher or far lower than you

do, and if you find yourself in such a position, it's a safe bet

that something is wrong somewhere.

On the other hand, you will frequently find yourself dealing

with someone a step or two higher or lower. If it is an initial

meeting, it may just be an accident that that person is present.

out how important you really are, and sent an important offi

cial because they didn't want to take the chance of offending

you. It may also be a deliberate signal by the Chinese that they

attach great importance to your company. If someone of

somewhat lower stature is sent, it may be a misunderstanding,

or it may be a signal that less importance is placed on you and

your business.

When you have a great deal of contact with individuals in a

Chinesc organization-in joint venture situations, for exam

ple—it's natural for some of the formality to break down as

people get to know one another better. For many democratic

I minded Westerners, this is an invitation to abandon artificial

distinctions and establish "buddy" relationships with the Chi

ncsc. While this approach can work—and work well—with

Chinese of equal rank, it can spell disaster with those of higher

and so on.

Whether you like it or not, it's important in business situa

tions to keep rank distinctions squarely in mind. This is probably as true among Chinese in Taiwan and Hong Kong and elsewhere as it is among mainlanders, though the pecking orders are a bit different when they are not set down by the government, as they are in the PRC. You should behave politely

in any case, hnt with Chinese who rank higher, you must be

any way presumptuous.

Bear in mind that they do not see themselves as your equals,

at least as far as their positions go. Although it is a hallmark of

Chinese etiquette that someone of higher rank never appears

to be condescending in behavior toward someone of lower

rank, that's really just form--not substance. If you're not num- her one in your organization, don't use the chance opporu- nity of a meeting with the head man on the Chinese side to try to establish guanxi; the attempt will probably backfire and you will appear ill bred and gauche for trying.

When you deal with those who rank lower than yourself,

the same prinpiies apply. Never do anything to give the im

pression you think yourself more important than the other per

son--that would be immodest and would earn you only

eontempt The Chinese admire people who don't put on airs,

but neither should you be overfriendly or too informal. Lower

raking Chinese, especially less educated, less sophisticated,

and more old-fashioned ones, want to be defreental to you.

sometimes it is not polite to prevail. And it is often hard to

know if a Chinese really wishes to treat or is just being politic.

If you are unclear on this point, think back to who "owes"

whom in the grand scheme of things, that is, who invited

whom out last, who did a favor for whom most recently, aud

so on. And think back to who suggested the meal in the first

place. But note also that if you are visiting a Chinese friend or

business contact and are on his or her home turf, the assump

tion is generally that your counterpart will pick up the ehck,

not you. Similarly, when you are in your home country, you

generally are the one who plays host.

The practice of inviting foreign friends over for a home

The cooked dinner is growing in popularity in the PRC. It's often

casier for a Chinese with whom you have absolutely no busi

ness connections to do this than one who may be in a position

to negotiate with you at some point. But at any rate, it is no

longcr a rarity for a foreiguer resident in China--or even a vis

itor with a number of Chinese friends—to receive such an in

vilation.

If you must decline the invitation for some reason, by all

to do this, the Chinese will read your response as a rebuff, and

will assume that your real reason for declining is that you do not

the hospitality may seem excessively formal to you—again, the

correctness probably only reflects the value placed on the re

the emphasis on protocol will wane, until it feels more and

more like an informal gathering of friends.

In most Chinese households, it is the mother who is rc-

sponsible for cooking, though there are exceptions. She is

likely to greet you when you first arrive, and then disappear

into the kitchen to cook the dinner. Since Chinese meals are

generally served a course at a time, and since most Chinese

live in one-wok homes, the mother may not recappear until she

has churned out all of the dishes. She will then cat what is left.

In such situations it is not necessary to wait until the cook is

finished before eating; indeed, to do so will only make the host

nervous and uncomfortable. It's gracious to ask after the

mother and to wonder aloud if she will be joining in the feast.

The Chinese being magnanimous hosts, they invited me to go along as well. But when we arrived at the restaurant at the appointed time, it was apparent in short order that the vice minister, who was at that point on the verge of retirement, didn't really remember my colleague at all, and in fact only had a dim recollection of his trip to the United States. But that didn't really make much difference. Though the conversation was somewhat lahored, the food was excellent, and everyone had a good time.

business meetings, if you are the principal guest you will be scated to the right of the principal host, with an interpreter stationed nearby to facilitate conversation. The second-ranking person in your party should be placed to the left of the host or somewhere else nearby and within earshot.

Tea is served, either by restaurant attendants or by someone

in the host's party. Damp cloths are often provided as well for

all to clean their hands and wipe their faces; they are provided

piping hot in winter and cold in the summer, and are very re

freshing. They may be left on a table or returned to a servicee

person after use.

Conversation during this initial reception period, which

generally lasts only about five minutes, is normally kept light

and nonsnhstantive. Your Chinese host may inquire about the

details of your day, ask how you are enjoying your visit to

China, or observe that you have managed to bring good

weather along with you. After a signal from the restaurant staff

that all is ready, the host will suggest that the group adjourn to

the tables to begin the meal. He or she may say something like

Bian chi, bian shuo, which basically means "Let's continue the

conversation as we eat."

When the host announces that it is time to sit down, all

members of the host party help the guests find their seats, a po

lite gesture. Cards at each plaee setting deelare who is to sit

Banquets often involve guests from organizations other than

those of the hosts and the guests. A Chinese business exec-

tive or government official may invite a representative of an-

other Chinese organization to a bauquet for a foreign visitor,

or perhaps more than one foreign company has scnt dclegates

to China for a particular purpose, and the Chinese host is en

tertaining all of them together.

In such cases, the rule is that

every major organization represented at the banquet should

be accorded a place of honor, and this generally implies

heing seated at the head table, unless the person is too

low-ranking for this to be appropriate. The place to the

immediate left of the principal host is often used for such

guests. Spouses of invited guests are accommodated at

the same table as their partners unless this is not feasible

(for example, if there are too many VIPs present, and in

(for example, if  $\mathfrak{inc}$  are too many VIFs present, and in

host.

Common sense dictates that there be exceptions to any

in which forks are nowhere in sight. The Chinese are not of

rigid seating protocol, and there are. For example, the Chi

nese find it as awkward as anyone elsec when people seated

at the same table cauot commuuicate with one another

because they have no common language. Thus interpreters

are seated where they are needed, without regard to their

rank and status. Aud other bilingual people, even if not offi

eially designated as interpreters, are also dispersed as neces

blend of East and West. The Chinese don't use knives while dining because they have traditionally considered the knife a weapon with no place at a table where friends are sharing a meal. Also, since cutting and chopping are both part of the Chinese chef's craft, they are typically done in the kitchen before Chinese food is cooked.

# THE MEAL

A plate of cold—or rather, room-temperature—appetizers is generally on the table when the party first sits down, or else is

served very shortly thereafter. There are usually at least four different delicacies, and there may be many more; sometimes

they are served on several small plates arranged at the edge of

the lazy Susan. To the Chinese, the presentation of food is as

important as its taste, and nowhere is this more evident than

in the cold platter, which hegin the meal. The appetizers may be artfully arranged in the shape of a flower, a dragon, a gold-

fish, a peacock, a phoenix, a Chinese lantern, or a butterfly, to

name just a few examples. And they may he made out of bar

bucced beef, duck, chicken, ham, pickled vegetables, bean

curd, jellyfish, cuttlefish, scaweed, or any of a couple of dozen

other ingredients.

When the table is laid, the place settings for the principal

and second hosts at each table are augmented with an addi

tional set of chopsticks, and perhaps an extra serving spoon.

These inplements are not used to eat, only to serve. This is as

much a sanitary measure as it is a point of etiquette. The rule

is that no one samples any dish until the principal host has

# TABLE MANNERS

There are certain differences between the Chinese and Western conceptions of appropriate table manners of which

stances it isn't polite in China to touch your food—still less anyone else's food—with your hands. Chinese food is deliberately cut up into bite-sized pieces in the kitchen before it is served, so that chopsticks will be the only equipment necessary.

sary at the table.

Though the morsels of food arc of manageable size, they may still contain bones or shells. The Chinese are fond of

hacking through bone when cutting meat or poultry, or of

leaving the shells on shrimp or other shellfish to prescrve their

flavor. You may see Chincsc discard bones or shells on the

table next to their place settings or even on the floor. This is

not the finest of manners, but it is often done, especially on

less formal occasions. At banquets you should remove bits of

hone from your mouth (with chopsticks if possible) and place

them in a small dish that is part of your place setting and is frc

sequently removed by service personnel. Occasionally a howl

will be passed around for the express purposc of discarding

thescpieces.

Some of the finer points of Western table etiquette are unknown in China. It is not impolite to place your elbows on the

table, for example. Nor do you need to wait until everyone has been served before you begin cating any particular dish. Dishes are not, as a rule, passed around the table; they are placed in the center and you reach across the table to get at them, even if you

not to use the chopsticks to spear your food. This is no siu, but

the Chinese don't do it. Try if at all possible to capture your

food between the tips of two chopsticks.

If you should happen to drop a piece of food ou the floor or the table, don't pick it up; just leave it there. If you drop a

# WHAT TO GIVE

Chinese delegations visiting foreign countries often arrive with valises packed full of gifts. Companies, universities, or other organizations that host the group or simply meet with them are rewarded with these gift items. And generally speak

ing, the more the organization has done for the group, the more valuable will be the gift.

The Chinese are fond of giving objects of art and handicrafts produced in China. These may range from the snblime to the ridiculous; for every painstakingly crafted cloisonne vase, lacquerware serving piece, or hand-painted scroll there is a garish porcelain Buddha, an iridescent velvet wall hanging, or a cloak that plays the theme from Dr. Zhivago. It is, however, the thought that counts, and no one can accuse the Chinese

of not being thoughtful when it comes to gifts.

If you are giving a major gift to a Chinese organization, art objects are thus clearly acceptable. One approach is to try to give something created in your own country, and ideally something representative of local arts and crafts. Stenben glass, Revere silver, Wedgwood, or Illumel figurines, for example, would all be acceptable. Keep in mind, however, that many Chinese lack the criteria to evaluate objects of Western art, and probably wouldn't fully appreciate the quality of Steuben glass. A book featuring beautiful photographs of your native land would also be a good gift; Chinese who do not travel abroad can thumb through the pages and learn something of

the world outside. Another approach is to give something useful. If you are vis

sumer electronics also qualify as useful gifts. Still another appropriate memento is on

thing about your company. It might be a book about the his

tory of your firm, or perhaps a model or sample of one of your products. If you are in China on a return visit, an album of

photographs of your counterparts taken during their trip to your country is a sure winner. If you give a book, having your

your country is a safe winner. If you give a win, having your company's chairman or president inscribe it is an excellent

idea; it's a signal to the Chincse that your visit to China has re

ceived attention at the highest levels of your organization.

thing, so bring extras along just in case. Another excellent

idea: tickets to local concerts or musical shows.

Gifts given to friends or those presented in nonbusiness sit

uations can be more personal. Audioeassettes are always wel

structures that make up any Chinese corporation or govern

specify who is supposed to do what to whom. As anyone with

a modicum of experience in the PRC can tell you, the key to

getting anything important accomplished in China lies not in

the formal order, but rather in who you know, and in how that

person views his or her obligations to you.

The Chinese call this concept guanxi. It's a term that liter

y means "relationships," but that in this context translates

far better as "connections." Of course it is by no means unique

to China: Western society is hardly without its own concept of

"pull." It's just that the Chinesc have raised guanxi to a high

art. It pervades the social order, and nowhere more than in

today's PRC.

that, while not easy to come by, did not involve large outlays

of cash.

Today, however, in an era of multimillion-dollar deals,

fierce competition, and international travel, guanxi can

count for a great deal more. Companies, foreign and local

alike, spend heavily to establish and maintain relationships

with those who run and influence China's powerful govern

ment organizations and state-owned conglomerates. The

payoff may bc personal, ranging from a job or foreign un

versity admission for a senior official's child to a disreer but

illegal transfer of funds into a Hong Kong bank account. Or

it may be organizational, such as cutting a Chinese unit in

on a deal as a means to secure the connection. The outsiders

then count on the guanxi they have established to protect

them from overhurdensomic regulations or costly changes in

the government policy, or to prolong the terms of a profitable

sweetheart deal.

your mother were classmates, will you use your influence to get a high-ranking official to come to the event my organization is planning? The distinction between the personal and the professional is obvious to foreigners and often matters a great deal to them; it is, however, one that is often lost on the Chinese. It is important to note that Chincsc expectations notwithstanding, foreigners are well within their rights to draw their own lines as to what they are and are not prepared to deliver for those with whom they have established guanxi. Even though the Chinese may be willing to bend the rules, this does not mean that foreigners must do the same. In my experience, Chincsc can be made to understand my own ethical limits if I take the trouble to explain them. I generally try to steer clear of those who cannot, as more often than not I find such relationships problematical. Chinese may also differ from Westerners in the level of delicacy with which they approach asking for favors. The establishment and nsc of guanxi may be accomplished very dicultly, but equally often it can be entirely lacking in subtlety. When someone you know but have not seen for months or even years shows up on your doorstep bearing a gift, as illustrated in the previous chapter, it isn't hard to figure out that the inevitable request for a favor is coming. With Westerners the gift is much more likely to come later, and it would be viewed as declassc even to allude to a gift before the favor is granted. Westerners are far more coy in acknowledging that any tit-for-tat is going on in a relationship; the Chincsc, on the other hand, see these things in far more pragmatic terms. Chinese generally feel freer to ask for favors earlier in a relationship than Westerners do. To be sure, only an uncouth

The importance of guanxi in navigating the bureaucracy in China cannot be overstated, and in recent years it has become a commodity that is increasingly for sale. Many of the sons and daughters of high-ranking cadres, in particular, have set up "consulting" shops or "service" companies and offered their ability to mobilize their own guanxiwang, and those of their parents, to the highest bidder. Even the children of former officials not currently in favor can make a living by becoming in

# GUANXI FOR SALE

Unlike foreigners, who may feel quite put upon when asked for favors—especially personal favors that involve the use of organizational resources—Chinese are often very eager to be of service if they have it in their power to assist. This is true for two reasons. First, because doing a favor for a friend is inherently face-enhancing; it shows you are a person of some means or ability. And second, because every favor you do builds your credit column on the balance sheet that governs your relationship with the requester. You arc, in essence, banking chits against the day that you will be the one who needs the favor.

Chinese will hit a stranger up for a favor on the first meeting, but by the second or third get-together a new friend is generally considered fair game for a request. One does not want to give the impression of giving the bum's rush, even if that is exactly what is going on, so one waits a decent interval before putting new guanxi to work. But in the eyes of many foreigners, the Chinese often accelerate the definition of "decent."

tration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC): Pay a confiscatory fine or lose the registration, and with it the company's ability

to operate legally in China. After much hand-wringi

After much hand-wringing, the management decided to try back-channel routes to the SAIC through guanxi, but

none of the senior advisors retained by the company were

able to hclp; though they knew ministers and State Council

members, they didn't know any local SAIC officials. Ever

more desperate as the days tickcd away, the management

eventually discussed the problem openly with all of the com

pany's employees, at which time an entry-level clerk came

forward. It turned out that she had gone to high school with

the daughter of a local SAIC director. After several phone

calls and a banquet, the registration was renewed, with no

fines paid.

Such is the power of guanxi.

# RECAP: EIGHT TIPS ON GUANXI

1. The concept of guanxi (connections) is not unique to

China, but it is vital to getting important things accom

plished there. Local and foreign companies spend heav

ily to establish and maintain relationships with

influential people. The payoff may be personal or orga

nizational.

2. At its heart, guanxi is a tit-for-tat relationship between

two people. Chinese naturally turn to their relationship

networks for help, so they work hard to cultivate friends

in high or strategie places. If a Chinese finds him- or her

# GUANXI: GREASE FOR THE WHEELS OF CHINA 195

self without guanxi, tbc first order of business is to estab-

lish somec.

3. Onc reason for the pervasiveness of the guanxi system on

the mainland is the relative lack of a reliable legal sys

tem. But it is also important in areas outside China,

where the legal system is more developed.

Good guanxi is a renewable resource and can be rcestab-

lished even after much time has passed. But it may also

bc an exhaustible resource if the lcdger between two peo

ple does not remain in approximate balance.

5. Guanxi is well within the grasp of foreigners who wish to

cultivate it. Often all it takes is an overture—a conversa

tion, a meal, or a favor. Foreigners who live and work in

China may become integrated into relationship net-

works, where they are expected to play by Chinese rules.

Nonetheless, they are within their rights to draw their

own lines as to what they are and arc not prepared to dc

liver.

6. The Chinese assume the rest of the world works along a

similar set of principles, and they sometimes view foreign

friends as windows to benefits in the world outside

China. They also often do not distinguish clearly be

tween the world of the personal and the world of the or

ganizational, which means that a personal friend may

well ask for an organizational favor.

7. Chinese generally feel freer to ask

relationship than Westerners do. Unlike foreigners, who

may feel quite put upon when asked for favors—espc

cially personal favors that involve the use of organiza

tional resources—Chinese are often very eager to be of

service if they have it in their power to assist. In recent

years guanxi has even become a commodity for sale.

8. Chinese prefer to do business with, and even to hire,

those with whom they have guanxi, as contrasted to an

aversion to doing this among Westcrners. They b/cive it

diminishes the danger of problems, and makes solving

themuchcasierwhentheydoarise.

Mianzi:AboutFace

I've often wondered if it could possibly be mere coincidence that the term "face" has so many meaings common to English and Chinese. In both tongues, it can mean not only

# Chapter XI

# 202 CHINESE BUSINESS ETIQUETE

Face is by no means only an individual asset. Organizations have face, too. Ministries, corporations, and bureaus all have

reputations to worry about; so do entire countries. Not long ago, an American company got a taste of national ire when it

by the offending company would set the matter right.

Such patriotism runs deep among Chinese today for a host

of reasons. The first is a fundamental xenophobia that is based

or reasons. The interest in the surface of a surface is never very far from the surface. To this basie

distrust of foreigners, add pride in a rich history of accom

plishments poised against a decided feeling of inferiority in

the face of the indisputable technological superiority of the

West today as well as a couple of hundred years of humiliation

at the hands of Western powers. Finally, given the total lack of

diated by those on the spot, with blame assigned, justice dis

pensed, and the matter settled relatively quickly and easily.

# MIANZI: ABOUT FACE 203

But because it was a foreigner who did the punching, the situation escalated into a full-blown international incident. The

"foreign devil" was denounced by onlookers as having insulted

the Chinese people as a whole, and the matter ultimately re

quired mediation by the public security bureau. A grave threat

to national "face" was detected where only a silly disagreement

between two people had existed. In this case, money had to

change hands to set the matter right.

Face is also very much present in business transactions

even simple price negotiations. While state-owned corpora

tions are seldom able to offer substantial discounts, it is a rare

individual enterprise that does not offer them, especially to fa

vorite customers, friends and relatives, and those who buy in

bulk. Most merchants routinely quote priees considerably

higher than what they expect to get so they can offer a dis

count to buyers who demand just a little bit of mianzi to make

them feel good about a transaction or look good to others. And

the sellers generally expect reciprocal treatment when the ta

the sellers generally expect reciprocal treatment when the ta

bles are turned.

For instance, a friend of mine was bargaining for an objet d'art

at au antique market a few months ago, but there was still a gap

of about 200 renminbi between the asking and selling prices. He

felt that his top offer was all the object was worth, and declined

to go higher. This transaction had, of course, by then attracted its

share of gapers and kibitzcrs, and while my friend eventually pre

vailed and the object changed hands, the proprietor chastised

him before he left. The crime? Failing to give the proprietor face

by upping his final offer, even if only nominally. The hawker's

face had been lost, presumably, in the eyes of the observers and

his immediate neighbors at the bazaar.

relegates the notion of "face" to a lower priority. It is not hard

to conceive of a "rugged individualist" in the West who cares

relatively little about relationships with other people. Given

enough food to eat, money to spend, and a certain level of

emotional fulfillment, such a person could conceivably live

quite happily, even if disliked by others in the community for

one reason or another. America is full of such people.

This has changed rather dramatically over the last decade, as state-owned corporations and, increasingly, even private companies, have assumed many of these functions in the evolving "socialist market economy."

Because of the PRC's socialist system, many tasks that would be accomplished in the private sector in a non-Communist nation—such as the manufacture of goods, the provision of housing, or the operation of transportation systems—have traditionally been under the aegis of some unit or other of the government.

and commerce has declined, so too has its authority over the

personal lives of the Chinese people. There is no more gov-

ernment rationing of scarce commodities—indeed, there is far

less scarcity; changing jobs is relatively easy to do, ownership

of homes and cars is no longer unhcard of; and there are even

nasccnt real estate and stock markets.

Traditionally, however, central planning dictated that power

be concentrated in Beijing, where dozens of commissions,

ministries, administrations, associations, and agencies planned

and coordinated the work of the country, and most of these or

ganizations still exist in one form or another. A typical ministry

or commission breaks out into many bureaus and divisions.

Provincial and municipal governments mirror the structure of

the central government. And even in many government-run

corporations, the word "government" is often more the opera

tive term than the word "corporation" as far as behavior is con

cerncd.

The chain of command among government units has always

been a Byzantine system of dual reporting. For example, a drug

factory or corporation located in Shanghai would likely report to

the Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Bureau, an organization that it-

self reports to both the State Pharmaceutical Administration,

which is a part of the central government in Beijing, and to the

Shanghai municipal government. And various other agencies

the local labor bureau, the local environmental bureau, the local

supplies burcau, the local planning bureau, and the local burcau

for administration and commerce, to name just a few—would

also have regulatory authority over certain activities of the fac

tory.

Innovation in such a huge bureaucracy is bound to be a

painful process even when everything runs smoothly—and

# BUREAUCRATIC DECISION-MAKING

The areas controlled by the bureaucracy are vast, and the numbers of people involved phenomenal. Yet it would be hard

to imagine a more conservative, change-resistant system. Decisions are most often made by consensns, and they are gener

ally top-down affairs. Since authority is not explicitly delegated

to thosc at lower levels in China, subordinates tend to be in

secure about deciding much of anything. You seldom go

wrong or are criticized for doing nothing; you are blamed only

when you demonstrate initiative. The result is that even the

most minor matters are referred up the chain of command,

and that the highest-ranking cadrcs are inundated with minu

tiae.No one wants to be held accountable for anything.

Then, too, there is the factor that a bad order, once issued,

is rescinded only with the greatest of difficulty. As noted in

Chapter 11, face is considered to be at stake when someone

must go baek on a decision. This means that when an official

has made a bad policy call, subordinates are loath to approach

him or her about changing it, and its chances of remaining in

force, no matter how misguided, inconvenient, or destructive

is, are pretty good.

Decision-making can occasionally be fairly expedient, but

is more often painfully inefficient and complex. An order by a

high-level official is easily executed, for no one would pre

sume to argue with a high-level approval-provided, of

course, that it is an official with some authority over you or

your organization. But if a decision requires cooperation

among more than one unit in the burancracy--or even,

often, among different departments within the same unit

look out! "Lack of coordination" is only the mildest way to de

scribe what happens.

You should never assume that different departments are

sharing information, even when they are supposed to be doing

this, or that the information they do share is transmitted accu

generally slow to move. But there are many ways to get them

# ON THE FRONT LINES

rately. Consider it your responsibility to cover all the bases yourself, and you'll have fewer problems all around. You can always assume that different units have different in

tercsts and that they act in their own intercsts; you can safely

assume most of the time that they do not communicate effi

ciently with each other. You can frequently assume that there

is rivalry among units that share authority over a particular

issue, and that they probably dislike one another, making co

operation among them more of an exception than a rule. The

only way to get out of a deadlock in which one organization in

the bureaucracy is at odds with another is to find a way for

both to win or to appeal to an authority superior to both of

them. It is often only at this level that a binding decision can

be made.

The amount of red tape necessary to accomplish even

something very minor can be staggering, and reasons can al

ways be found to foil any request. Preccident is a common one:

"We've never had such a request before" often means that we

are not interested in entertaining such a request now. Equity

is another: "If we make an exception and let you do this, we

would have to let everyone do it." And then there are the old

would have to let everyone do it . And then there is a

standbys: "It is inconvenient to do as you wish" and "Your re

quest is under consideration."

After several run-ins with the testing infrastructure, the

Finding a win-win solution often involves the expenditure

of a great deal of effort to uncover the underlying motivation

true recipe for being turned down, turned away, refused, ig-

nored, or sabotaged. In this respect China is no different from

anyplace else, but people in China have a higher than average

need for mianzi.

When Chincse people interact with authority figures, their

default demeanor is typically respectful, deferential, and obe

dient, if not positively sycophantic. Behavior may even border

on the unctious, and abject toadying is not uncommon. The

motive for this sort of behavior may be as much fear of the ar

bitrary exercisc of authority--as in the police officer who

might fine you not because you broke the law but because he

or she is in a bad mood that day—as it may be the desire for a

positive result, such as the answer to a question or the pro

cessing of a document.

Following the Chinese lead in this area is often a very ef

fective tactic. People are much more likely to do your bidding

in China if you give them the face they feel they so richly de

serve.

Catch flies with honey, not vinegar. There is one school of

thought that holds that the best way to get what you want from

a Chinese service person is to make yourself as obnoxious as

you can so that the person is motivated to mollify you just to

get you to go away. Over the years I have found, to the con

trary, that I am far more likely to be successful if I am friendly

than if I am nasty.

'This doesn't necessarily mean being compliant and docile;

if you are convinced what you are asking for is feasible and

pressing your point quietly, calmly, and relentlessly. But not

If you refuse to go away, you may be causing the person

it as relevant.

Tay the indirect approach. Not only does speaking in soft

quently give only subte signals as to their desires. This lack of

dreadness can sometimes be infuriating, but hearing between

their words is a skill worth developing. For example, if, during

nese asks you whether you have a car, chances are good that

he or she would appreciate it if you would offer a ride.

are important tools. Chinese frequently cultivate such people

against the future possibility that a favor will be needed. Ex

amples are endless, but one that comes to mind is a foreign

couple who lived in Beijing and were attempting to adopt a

Chinese baby. This process is generally a lengthy one because

it involves getting approvals from two feuding ministics.

Rather than wait the full year that the adoption agency told

them would be required, the couple assiduously cultivated

tries are Chinese units' favorite methods for assessing foreign

technology—and they are real plums for deserving (and not-soding) officials who have little opportunity to travel abroad.

Companies should select carefully, and host only those del

egations likely to be important to their business interests in

China. The decision should not be made lightly; hosting may

mean a great deal of work, may early mauy responsibilities,

and may be costly in terms of both time and money. Aud

doing it poorly or halfheartedly carries a real risk of causing of

fense. Once the decision to host is made, there are a number

of points to which companies should pay attention, both to

make the visit a substantive success and to make sure that the

relationships are handled properly and, ideally, deepened as a

result of the trip.

HOSTING THE CHINESE

Much of the protocol discussed in the previous chapters is

equally applicable to dealing with Chinese people both in

China and abroad. You'll never go far wrong if you choose to

catcr to Chinese sensibilities in such areas as meeting and greet

ing, dining, and conducting business meetings. On the other

hand, the Chinese expect things to be different when they travel

abroad. You should never feel compelled to discard your own

ways simply to make a Chinese more comfortable. There's a dif

ference between taking Chinese customs into account to make

someone's stay more enjoyable and slavishly following their rule.

book and abandoning your own cultural values in the process. If

you do the latter, your uncase with the situation will be immc

diately clear, and the entire visit will probably be not only less

comfortable, but also lcss effective all around.

# SHOULD YOU HOST A DELEGATION?

Chinese groups travel abroad for many different reasons. A delegation might be a high-level mission headed by a vice pre

mier or minister looking to sign a protocol with the host gov

ernment, make a sizable purchase, or visit certain facilities of

a large company. It might also be a survey group, looking

around to sec what type of equipunct or technology is avail

able but not empowered to sign contracts. Such groups fre

sequently travel abroad to attend conventions or exhibitions, and

often attempt to schedule company visits on the side.

On the other hand, the trip could be little more than a cer

emonial visit-a reward to some high-ranking cadre about to

re retire for his or her years of service to a ministry. Or it might

be a planning group, eager to assess—or copy—available tech-

ters. The leader may be supported by a deputy leader, called a

futuanzhang. If the delegation ever splits np into two groops to attend separate fnnctions, this person generally becomes

the head of the splinter group. Senior cadres who may be shown on this list for specific reasons may be designated as

advisors, or guwen. They hold high rank in the delegation, but

generally have no administrative responsibilities; for many the delegation trip is little more than a well-earned hoondoggle in

advance of retirement.

Beyond these officers, delegations may have secretaries (rc-

sponsible for taking notes), treasers (keepiug accounts and

handling money for the gronp), interpreters, and liaison offi

cers, who often handle one of the other functions as well.

There are almost always one or two very low-ranking individ

uals who tend to administrative tasks such as collecting lug

gage at each stop and keeping charge of the gronp's passports

and airline tickets. Very high-ranking groups may also be es

corted by a functionary from a Chinese embassy or consulate

who is posted in the host country. This person's rank in the

delegation can be gauged from his or her position in the delegation.

gation name list.

The delegation leader is usually an official from a Chinese

government unit or corporation; the delegates themselves may

be technicians or engineers. They can usually be counted on

to have done their homework and to understand a good deal

of the basic technology underlying any given area of interest.

At the very lcast they will be up on contemporary literature in

the field, and will have some level of familiarity with yonr

mate their level of expertise.

If it is an important group and you are picking up the tab, you may want to consider booking a suite for the delegation head; if the Chinese will bear responsibility for local costs, check with them first to see what their wishes are in this regard.

on—that show your ecompany's logo is common practice. For more on this, see Chapter 9.

Entertaining at home. It's a real treat for a Chinese to be eutertained at the home of a corporate host. Not only is this a

personal history, and the other half lives, and an excellent way to break the ice. If you invite Chincse delegates to your home, it's fine to have your spouse and children on hand. In fact, it's probably expected.

Welcoming signs. One other amenity that is in no way expected to change, but that is appreciated is a sign welcoming

welcoming or necessary but that is appreciated is a sign welcoming the group at the location to be visited. In order for it to be ef

fective, of course, the sign should be written in Chinese. I once escorted a Chinese delegation to the headquarters of a multinational company where they were greeted by a large banner in Chinese proclaiming the company's enthusiastic welcome. The only glitch was that the banner had been hung upside down. The Chincse were amused by the mishap, but they appreciated the gesture very much nonetheless.

Flags. Some companies also decide to hang the Chinese flag out front as a sign of welcome. This is fine—and much appreciated—so long as you use the right flag. The sensitivity here is to the flag used by Taiwau, which despite loss of recognition by most Western countries still manages to show up in many places. The PRC flag is red with five stars on it, one larger than the other four. That's the only flag to use when hosting mainland groups. Taiwan's "Republic of Chiuua" flag also has a red background, but it has a blue field in the upper left-hand corner

with one large, white sunlike star on it. Makc sure it is well out of sight before a PRC delegation shows up. Mainlaud groups have been known to turn on their heels in protest and walk right out of a building that displays the Taiwan flag, so this is nothing to be taken lightly.

Maps. In a related vein, something else to watch out for is the use of maps in your sales or corporate literature. Showing Taiwan on any map of China is not only perfectly acceptable, it is required. And be sure Taiwan is not portrayed in any way as an independent country, or as an entity separate from the mainland. Avoid the "Republic of China" label like the plague, and don't show Taiwan in a color different from that of the rest of China. This should not be problematical when you host groups from Taiwan, by the way. The government of Taiwan also regards Taiwau as a part of China. For Taiwan groups, however, you might wish to stay away from PRC flags. For Hong Kong groups, dou't worry; since Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 they now fly the PRC flag (as well as one of their own) and consider themselves a part of China.

Photography. By all means invite the company photographer out to take some photos of the Chinese visitors. Not only might these be useful for the company newsletter (see below), but they are excellent follow-up gifts for your next trip to China. The Chinese love photographs, and a picture of you and the delegation standing at your company's factory in front of au important piece of equipment is not only a valuable moment; it is also a way to keep your company and its products fresh in your guests' minds for many months.

# AFTERWORD

# Afterword

Once you've learned to read the subtexts, you have to decide how much you want to play the game. Should you bend over backward to avoid causing Mr. Wang to lose face? Should you try to cultivate a relationship with Ms. Zhou simply to secure her cooperation or approval on a business deal? It's really up to you, but remember that no matter how silly you may feel it is, face is serious business to Mr. Wang. And Ms. Zhou is unlikely to work very hard on behalf of someone who has ignored her.

understanding and accommodating people with unfamiliar

patterns of interaction that may seem, at times, to be gracious,

strange, funny, obsequious, indirect, refreshing, counterpro

ductive, and downright maddening. On the other hand, it is

also about being yourself: being true to your own cultural tra

ditions and valncs, and behaving in accordance with the best

of these. Snch balance is difficult, but your success with the

Chinese requires that you strive for it, since you won't achieve

much by tilting too far to either side.

No one gets very far in China without at least learning to

read the signals. What is not said is as important as what is, and

how something is said can speak volumes. Like it or not, the

Chinese will never be as straightforward as you might wish,

and you're going to have to be alert for snbtlc signs and pat

terns if you are to discern the true meaning of their behavior.

Taking it at face value may be tempting, but most of the time

it's a fairly inaccurate barometer of what's really going on.

Once you've learned to read the subtexts, you have to decide how much you want to play the game. Should you bend over backward to avoid causing Mr. Wang to lose face? Should you try to cultivate a relationship with Ms. Zhou simply to secure her cooperation or approval on a business deal? It's really up to you, but remember that no matter how silly you may feel it is, face is serious business to Mr. Wang. And Ms. Zhou is unlikely to work very hard on behalf of someone who has ignored her. I freely admit I am no agnostic on this subject. I believe strongly that showing respect for the Chincsc point of view is the key to enjoying successful relationships with them. For me, it means finding a private moment if I must criticize someone and choosing words that do not pack a punch. It means actively seeking opportunities to give face and enhance people's prestige. It means going the extra mile to serve food to guests at banquets, being careful during meetings not to seize the floor when it isn't my turn, controlling my anger in public, and looking for win-win solutions to problems, even when I am extremely annoyed at my counterpart for some offense or other. To a certain extent I do these things for utilitarian reasons: I have learned that I get better results from the Chinese wheu I do. But another factor is that I have come to see the wisdom in certain aspects of the Chinese approach—ways of doing things that may be kinder, more sensitive, or more polite than my standard American modus operandi would dictate. My willingness to behave in a Chinese way ends, however, when I feel I am compromising something essential in my own personality, or when I believe my sense of ethics or morality may be in jeopardy. I may choose my moments and my

ing their hardest to get you to do things their way.

Then too, China itself is nothing if not a moving target. You

have to travel farther and farther into the countryside these

days to find Chinese who are as unaware of Western ways as

most were a dozen or more years ago. And many urban Chi

nese are in fact growing quite sophisticated in their under

standing—aud, in some cases, imitation—of Western values

and standards of behavior. So one can make a strong argument

that the gap is, in fact, narrowing of its own accord.

Nonetheless, there are still those inclined to be afraid of

China or of the Chinese. Fear of China isn't as silly as it may

sound; the very foreignness of the country has persuaded many

Westerners over several centuries that China is ultimately in

scrutable, and that they can't trust their instincts in a culture

governed by such an incomprehensible set of rules of con

duct. If this book demonstrates anything it is that many of the

rules are essentially the same, that many allowances are made

TONES

To complete the story; however, you must also understand

tone; Chinese is a sound-poor language; that is, combining

nlls and finals yields a Relatively small number of possible

pronunciations. The size of this universe is increased, how-

ever, since every syllable also has a tone contour, or intona

tion, in addition to an initial and a final. This means that each

sylkahl must be pronounced in the prope tone of voce in

order for one's meaning to be clear. Spoken Mandarin has

foue such basic tones: a high, cven tone: a rising tone; a dip

ping tone; and a falling tone. It also has a neutral, or non

stressed, tone.

Fngn has intoration pattns, too, but not nearly to the

eent that Chinese does. For example, if you pronounce the

senee "The book is on the table" first normally and then

with a rising intuition, you can see that by varying only the

terrogative one. The difference is that in Chinese, each sylla

ble has a tone, and their various meanings have absolutely

nnoo nnoo oone aone

In Chinese, the syllable tangean mean "soup" (when said

in a high, even tone), "sugar" (a rising coke), "to lie down" (a

dipping tone), and to irou something" (a descending tone).

And, depending on the actual character, it can mean a lot of
