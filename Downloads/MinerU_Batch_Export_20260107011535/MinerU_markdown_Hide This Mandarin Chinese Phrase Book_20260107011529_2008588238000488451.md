This un-censored phrase book's got you covered with everything you need to speak cool Chinese—saying hi, getting a room, spending your bucks, finding a cheap place to eat, scoring digits... and a helluva lot more. We've even thrown in a few totally offensive, completely inappropriate, and downright nasty terms—just for fun. You'll be able to easily spot these by looking for
We've got your back with insider tips, too. Check these out for up-to-date info that'll help you maneuver around a Chinese locale...

cool facts that may seem like fiction tips on what's hot and what's not info you've gotta know
Warning — this language can get you into trouble. If you wanna say it in public, that's up to you. But we're not taking the rap (like responsibility and liability) for any problems you could encounter by using the expressions in this book.

# SPEAK CHINESE - THE EASY WAY

This book will not make you an expert in Chinese, but it will help you get through your stay without sounding like a loser when speaking the language. To make it easy for you, we've provided really simple phonetics (those letters right under the Chinese expressions) with every entry you could say out loud. Just take note that not all pinyin* letters or letter combinations are pronounced as they normally are in English. We've prepared a quick guide to the pinyin system to help you. (*Pinyin is the most widely used romanization and pronunciation system for Chinese.)

# THE BASICS

# hi there

Make a good impression on the locals from the get-go.

Hello!

你好！ ni hao
Formal yet friendly.

Hi!

嗨！ hai
Casual and to the point.

Hi, how are you?

嗨，你好！ hai, nǐ hǎo
Good evening.

晚上好。 wan shang hao

# how're you doin'?

Ask about someone's well-being.

你好！ ni hao
What's up?

Doing well?

# Stoop

When meeting someone for the first time, the Chinese usually say '你好 (nǐ hǎo). This is often done simultaneously with or followed closely by a handshake. Handshakes should be firm to show your sincerity. Despite great modernization taking place throughout the nation, the Chinese are basically pretty conservative in their show of affection. It's best to avoid hugs and air kisses when you meet someone for the first time – unless you are fond of shocking your host(s)!

# hey you!

Wanna get someone's attention? Try these.

Excuse me!

嗨！ hai
Not to be used as an apology.

Sir! / Ma'am!

先生！/夫人！ xiān shēng / fū rén
Use this when you wanna be polite.

Yo!

啃！ you
A quick way to get someone's attention.

Hey!

嘿！ hei
young ladies. For example, Zhang xian sheng (Mr. Zhang), Zhang nu shi (Mrs. Zhang or Ms. Zhang), or Zhang xiao jie (Miss Zhang). If you're with close friends, you may address an older person as Lao (老) Zhang (if his or her last name is Zhang). Someone who is your peer or younger is xiao (小) Zhang. A word of caution: only do this if you are really close friends!

# sorry

Oops...need to apologize?

My bad.

我的错。 wo de cuo
Excuse me!

不好意思！ bu hao yi si
Sorry!

对不起！ dui bu qi
I'm sorry.

对不起！ dui bu qi
I'm truly very sorry.

真的非常对不起。 zhēn de fēi cháng dui bù qǐ
I was bad.

都是我的错。 dōu shi wǒ de cuò

# Stoop

Need cheap airline tickets? China's many domestic airlines offer great deals throughout the year. Most international flights bring you directly to Beijing, Shanghai or Hongkong, and from there, you can connect to almost all other cities via domestic flights. Do your research online or check with the many air-ticketing agencies in the three cities. Compare prices to ensure that you get the best deal.

There are three major nation-wide holidays in China: the Spring holiday (usually sometime between mid Jan and mid Feb), the May Day holiday (1st of May), and the National Day holiday (1st of October). Each of these holidays lasts for about seven days at a stretch. If you plan to go sightseeing, you'd really want to avoid these periods when half the country is either on holiday (with you!) or jostling for air- and train-tickets (with you!).

# in flight

# Stoop

Just arrived in China? There are many ways to get from the airport to your hotel. In Beijing, Shanghai, and other major cities, you can take the airport shuttle buses. (Each passenger pays around 20-MB.) These buses operate on a fixed route, and you will be dropped off at major hotels or at a spot near your hotel.

Alternatively, you could take a taxi, which might cost between 80-MB, depending on where you're going. Most taxi drivers do not speak English so it would be handy to have the destination address in Chinese. Remember to get a receipt from the taxi driver - just in case you leave anything behind, the receipt will enable the local authorities to locate the driver. In Shanghai, the new Maglev Monorail, capable of running at a top speed of over 310 mph, can bring you from the Pudong International Airport to the Lujiazui financial district (30 km away) in just 8 minutes! Tickets cost about MB per person. (Passengers with air-tickets in hand pay MB.) A must-try!

# FACT

First-time visitors to Beijing will want to check these world-famous venues off their list: the Great Wall, the Forbidden
City, the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven, the Tiananmen Square, and the fast disappearing Beijing hú-tòng (traditional alleys). In Shanghai, there's the Bund, the French Concession area, the People's Square, Yuyuan, and the Water Towns of Jiangnan. These days, those with an appetite for adventure head north to Inner Mongolia, venture south to Xinjiang, or go west to Tibet and the Silk Road.

# theoop

You can't go wrong with trains in China. Trains are such a vital mode of transport, there's a full ministry (the Ministry of Railways) overseeing the country's massive train network and operations.

There are four classes of tickets: hard seats, soft seats, hard sleepers, and soft sleepers. Tickets can be purchased from train stations, ticketing agencies throughout the cities, and possibly even from your hotel.

It is quite common for larger cities like Beijing and Shanghai to have more than one train station. So make sure you confirm your departure and arrival station if you are traveling by train.

During the major holidays, train tickets sell out very quickly as millions of Chinese in the cities travel to their vacation destinations, or home towns for family visits. Book your train tickets way ahead in advance if you are planning to travel during these periods.

It's not always the fastest way to get around, but it sure beats walking!

Where are we?

我们到哪一站了？   wǒ men dào nà yí zhàn le
Don't have a clue, huh?!

If getting trapped in big city traffic jams is not your cup of tea, give the subway a try. It is an inexpensive, and possibly faster
alternative. Train networks usually cover the central downtown area and connect the more prominent landmarks or locations. However, trains can get extremely crowded during the morning and evening peak hours. Get ready to brave the crush of the rush hour! Fares range from 3-MB and trains normally operate from around 5am to midnight.

# FACT

Most taxis in China are metered. Look for the出租 (chū zǔ) sign on
top of the taxi. The charges vary from city to city. (The flag down fee ranges from 5-MB and the rate is normally about 2-MB per mile.) Taxi trips can cost a lot more during rush hour as taxis get stuck in traffic jams for ages. So avoid the rush hour if you can.

Most taxi drivers do not speak English. Have the name and location of your destination written in Chinese - if you can - to
avoid confusion. At the hotel, airport, train station, etc, wait at the taxi line, and get a taxi from an authorized taxi company. If someone tries to bring you to his own taxi, say "No" as these taxis are illegal and you may end up paying much more than you should. Some of these drivers are also known to be quite rogueish in their behaviour.

Experience close contact travel.

# FACT

In suburban areas and small towns, the motorized bicycle (similar to a moped) and the three-wheeled motor bicycle are
popular forms of transportation. They can be as fast as motor cars and some of them operate as 'taxis'. The fares are of course much cheaper, but you'll need to negotiate a price with the driver (who won't speak any English!).

# FACT

Currency exchange is only available at airports, major banks, hotels and a few major departmental stores. (Hotels
only provide this service to house guests.) Take note that not all bank branches provide currency exchange service. And bring along your travel documents as you will need to present them during the transaction. Traveler's checks are not widely accepted, except at most banks.

Most international credit cards are accepted in major hotels and departmental stores. (Look for credit
card logos displayed at entrances or cashier counters.) Everywhere else – in restaurants, shops, and convenience stores – cash is the primary mode of payment. You may be able to withdraw cash from ATMs using your credit card, but it's best to check this with your bank before heading for China.

# FACT

When you make a purchase in China, remember to ask for an official invoice or "fā piǎo". Sales receipts issued by
vendors are not recognized as "official invoice" in China. An official invoice is a formatted document issued by the local authorities to the business establishment and it bears two official stamps – one from the authorities and the other from the vendor. The "fā piao" is the official proof of purchase, and you will need it for any exchanges, refunds, or claims (if anything should go awry with your purchases).

There is no sales tax per se in China. So you don't pay any direct taxes on your purchases, and therefore there is no tax refund for tourists.

# FACT

Don't get burnt out. China uses the 220-volt, 50-cycle AC. If you're bringing your gizmos to China, check to see if you'll
need a voltage converter. A variety of electrical outlets can be found in China, so a good all-around adaptor plug set is recommended. The most common outlets are those that fit a two-pin plug with flat blades, or a three-pin plug with oblique flat blades.

# Seoon

For cheap accommodation in China, you have a choice of the budget hotels, youth hostels or guest houses. Budget hotels are available in most cities. They are cheap and pretty basic. If you want to give the youth hostels or guest houses a try, do some online research of your own first. Guest houses are generally more common in the more rural areas such as Yunnan and Lijiang.

# Breakfast

Grab breakfast anytime between 7-10 a.m. There's a variety of Chinese style breakfast offerings to choose from: steamed stuffed-buns, soya bean milk, you-tiao, porridge, etc. Get these from the local eateries and markets where they are the cheapest and most authentic. Otherwise, there's the ever-dependable continental breakfast that is served in most hotels.

# Lunch

Lunch is early: from 11a.m.-2 p.m. For most Chinese, lunch is a quick and simple affair. You can savour fuss-free Chinese food at local food courts, kiosks or local restaurants. (It used to be the norm to take an afternoon siesta after lunch!)

# Dinner

The Chinese have dinner between 6-9 p.m. The pace for dinner is usually much slower. It is almost like a reward after a hard day's work. Dinner is also more elaborate and usually lasts much longer than breakfast or lunch. Most Chinese will indulge in a drink or two during dinner.

depends on the number of people dining together. For example, 10-12 dishes will usually be ordered for a group of 10. If you have dinner by yourself or with only one or two friends, you may like to order something simpler like a bowl of noodles for each person.

# Stoon

Despite the rest of the world's obsession with coffee and coffee culture, tea remains the most popular beverage in China. The Chinese started drinking tea way before the 6th century and that's probably why tea has become highly entrenched in the lives of the Chinese people. The five main types of tea sold in China are: green tea, black tea, wulong tea, compressed tea and scented tea.

# FACT

Life can get a little rough for coffee addicts in China. Most of the time, coffee, especially 'real' coffee and not
instant granular or powdered versions, can be extremely hard to find outside the big cities and hotels. You have been warned!

The Chinese drink tea like water. Everywhere you go - in restaurants, hotels, people's homes and offices - tea is served; even if you haven't asked for it! If you really loathe tea, fret not, bottled water, juices and soft drinks are always available; you've just got to ask for it.

# beer

Ready for a buzz?

Do you have ... beer?

请问有没有...啤酒？ qingwenyoumeiyou...pijiu？ bottled 瓶装 draft ping zhuang 生 shēng
A...beer,please.

请来一瓶...啤酒。

# Stoon

If you want to sample some local brews, check out brands such as Tsingtao, China Blue Ribbon, Yanjing, Sie-Tang Lio and Zhujiang. Local beers sold in convenience stores and supermarkets are reasonably priced (about 3-MB for a 500ml bottle) but expect to pay more if you are drinking at clubs or bars.

# FACT

Tipping is not a must but it is generally appreciated. Usually, tipping is done in more upscale places like hotels and
restaurants. You're not expected to tip at roadside eateries, smaller restaurants or convenience stores.

# drink up

There's no faster way to get a party started.

Do you want ...?

你想要...吗？
nǐ xiǎng yào … ma ?

an aperitif 开胃酒 kaiwei jiu wine 酒 jiu a glass of red wine 一杯红酒 yi bei hong jiu a shot 一个shot yige shot a gin and tonic 金汤尼 jin tang ni a screwdriver 一杯 screwdriver yi bei screwdriver

# FACT

The Chinese like their drinks. Meals are washed down with drinks. Celebrations are rarely done without any drinking.

Businesses are conducted over drinks. Unhappiness and sorrow are washed away with drinks. Scores can even be settled through drinking sessions!

If you want to raise a toast like a Chinese person, just hold up your drink, clink glasses together, and say "gan bei" (or "cheers"). Bear in mind though that "gan bei" literally means "emptying the cup" so use it sparingly.

# wine

Go ahead and order a glass—or bottle—of the best.

May I see the wine list, please?

我能看一下酒水单吗？ wó néng kàn yí xià jiǔ shuǐ dān mò

# FACT

The Chinese word for liquor is "jiu". Chinese liquor can be quite high in alcohol content, so look out before you
take a sip. There are two kinds of liquor - bái jiù (white 'wine'), like máo tái (茅台), and wú liáng yè (五粮液); and huáng jiū (yellow 'wine'), like nǔ ér hóng (女儿红).

Most people don't usually associate China with beaches but... with a coastline that stretches more than 18,000 km, China has dozens of beautiful beaches to offer. From Qingdao to Hainan, beaches scattered along the western coast of China are a haven for sun seekers. Sanya in Hainan island has even been touted as the Hawaii of Asia.

Here are some traditional festivals in China:

Spring Festival (or Lunar New Year). Usually occurs
between mid January to February. Most people take a 7-day break from work to celebrate the beginning of the new year.

Qing Ming Festival (April 4th, or 5th or 6th). The Chinese commemorate their ancestors and relatives who have passed on. It also signals the arrival of spring, and a change in the seasons.

Duan Wu Festival (around June 1st). People eat zong zi (rice wrapped and cooked in leaves) and take part in dragon boat races to commemorate Qu Yuan, a Chinese poet and patriot.

Chong Yang Festival (in early October). This auspicious day falls on the 9th day of the 9th lunar month. People enjoy cake and chrysanthemum blooms as part of the celebrations. Chong Yang is also Senior Citizen's Day in China.

Pingpong or table tennis is one of the most popular sports in China. It is regarded as national sport by the Chinese. Badminton is another favorite sport. The Chinese are also big fans of team sports like football, basketball and volleyball. Some rather interesting traditional sports include rope skipping (跳绳 tiao shen), shuttlecock kicking (踢毽子 ti jian zi), and kite flying (放风筝 fang feng zheng).

# FACT

Shopping in China can be a thrill because of the attractive bargains, but if you're not happy with your purchases, few
stores will give you your money back. You should be able to make an exchange if there is a flaw or defect in the product. Just make sure you have the official invoice or "fā piào" from the vendor.

# FACT

The price you see on the tag is the price you pay. There are no additional taxes on your purchases. You don't usually
have to tip as well (a service tax is already included in the total bill in most upscale restaurants and entertainment venues).

# thestoop

You must bargain with the vendors in the street shops and the flea markets - because they expect you to do so, and you may end up paying a lot more if you don't bargain. Check out Xiangyang market and Qipu Road Market in Shanghai; and Xiu Shui Street in Beijing.

# FACT

Public phones are still fairly common in China. There are coin phones and card phones. You can purchase prepaid
phone cards from convenience stores. In some rural areas, you may find regular phones doubling up as public phones in front of some shops. You'll have to pay cash to the store owners for the use of the phone.

There are a variety of prepaid phones cards issued by different companies and it is a good idea to compare prices to find the phone card that you need. For instance, some cards offer better discounts for long distance calls.

China uses the standard GSM wireless service that is common throughout Europe and most of Asia. To use your cell phone or mobile phone in China, you'll need a handset that is compatible with this GSM standard. If you are in doubt, you may want to consider renting a phone before leaving for your trip. (Some of these rented sets come with China SIM cards, so you're ready to start making phone calls the moment you land.) You could also purchase a China SIM card at your destination; if you have a handset that works. This is usually a cheaper option to international auto-roam service, but of course it involves more hassle, and you'll have a new China number for your phone.
