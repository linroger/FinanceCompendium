# The Pragmatics of Managing Negative Emotions in a Chinese Context

Drawing from rich, naturally occurring language data and synthesizing insights from the fields of interpersonal pragmatics and Chinese interpersonal communication, this book presents a compelling exploration of the management of negative emotions through an interpersonal pragmatics lens.

The volume seeks to answer a number of key questions at the intersection of these two fields, including: how do negative interpersonal emotions manifest in the context of Chinese culture? What connections exist between emotions and interpersonal dynamics? In what ways are these emotions intertwined with the moral framework of Chinese society? How are such negative emotions effectively navigated and regulated? The analysis goes beyond mere examination of emotional expressions, delving into the cultural nuances that shape the understanding and handling of emotions. The book elucidates, for instance, how unmet ganqing expectations can trigger emotions like anger and sadness, and in turn, the employment of rapport management strategies in their mitigation.

The book provides profound insights into a previously overlooked and little understood area of study, making it of interest to students and researchers in pragmatics, discourse analysis, communication studies, and psychotherapy.

# Foreword

This book, written by the young scholar Dr. Rong Lei, associate professor from the Center for Linguistics and Applied Linguistics at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies in P.R. China, provides a way of understanding negative emotions and their management from a combined culture-specific and interpersonal pragmatics approach in the Chinese context. As a complex phenomenon, emotions are believed to have various functions in our lives—for instance, positive emotions can help participants to communicate with others, and thus have more fulfilling results, but negative emotions can cause communication breakdowns or other unexpected outcomes on many occasions. Emotional management has therefore been considered essential either in ordinary lives or in institutional settings, involving the ability to manage and control emotions healthily and constructively.

This study about the pragmatics of managing negative emotions is of great importance because emotions can be both socially and interpersonally constructive. Negative emotions are unpleasant emotions that participants commonly experience in response to certain situations or events. Examples of negative emotions can include anger, fear, sadness, guilt, shame, jealousy, and anxiety. These emotions can be difficult to manage; thus they can have negative impacts on communication and interpersonal relationships. Thus, as an inseparable part of human activity, it is expected that emotions can be expressed and responded to appropriately in interaction. Effective emotion management can help participants cope with stress and challenging situations, improve interpersonal or group relationships, and even promote overall well-being. This means that language and discourse cannot be said to be completely devoid of emotional issues. The study of emotions is crucial not only for understanding the mechanisms of human minds, which has long been approached in psychology and neurology (Allegretta et al. 2021) but also for the study of discursive behaviours and strategy choices in language use.

Human interaction is strongly loaded with emotions, and rich expressions of emotions can be found in both English and Chinese. Emotions are expressed through various speech acts and can be managed by choosing flexible devices in context. Although there have been some studies about emotions from the perspectives and approaches of other disciplines, relevant topics await further research in the field of pragmatics or linguistics in general. For example, the main factors of power—distance and rank of imposition, which determine (im)politeness in Brown and Levinson's (1978, 1987) theory—imply certain emotions. Within their framework, the differences of power are likely to create both positive emotions (love, respect, satisfaction, appreciation, sympathy, etc.) and negative emotions (fear, hate, contempt, awe, etc.). The rank of imposition of a speech act in a culture often implies certain emotions. For instance, in Chinese culture, the act of persuading a guest to eat more ('Have another piece of cake', or serving more food to his bowl) is a way of showing hospitality or politeness. This is considered a case of positive emotion management, but in Western cultures, such an act is quite impositional and impolite, and so a negative emotion is most likely to arise. This shows that emotional issues can be culturally specific in interaction.

Emotions and interpersonal issues are interrelated with each other and interplay with each other in interactional practices. Goffman (1967), Brown and Levinson (1978,1987), and many other researchers maintain that face is associated with emotional reactions. If a social or interpersonal event establishes a face for a participant, he tends to 'feel good'; otherwise he probably feels bad or hurt, and then a loss of face can be felt. Affect has been mentioned in their preface to the 1987 edition, but they have not given emotions much room in their politeness framework. Brown and Levinson (1987) call for further attention to the interconnection between emotions and the distance variable. Theoretically, there are gaps in research about the functions of emotions and their interplay with face, (im)politeness, or identity. This consideration is different from that about power, distance, and other social variables and their effects on interpersonal effects. In some studies, emotional issues have been considered in theoretical frameworks about communication. For instance, in Spencer-Oatey's (2000, 2002, 2008) rapport management framework, it is argued that negative emotions arise when a participant's face is threatened, or behavioural expectations are not met. Emotion is then the product of social interaction in which face or sociality rights are involved. In a monograph about using language to offend, Culpeper (2011) has also discussed the emotional consequences of impoliteness, and how emotion and offence are closely associated with each other. His study shows that impoliteness is an emotional issue which can be caused by threatening quality face, violating equity rights, and other offensive acts in interactions.

There have been repeated pleas for the study of emotions, especially the interplay between emotions and relational work, emotions and (im)politeness or other issues of interpersonal pragmatics. For instance, Langlotz and Locher (2008) have examined relational work with attention to the intersection of cognition, interaction, and emotion. They argue that emotions play a quintessential role concerning relational work. When participants display emotions, they signal their evaluation of the ongoing linguistic negotiation of their social relationships as well as the transactional state of the shared practices. These point to a close link between the cognitive and emotional dimensions. Langlotz and Locher (2017) hold that emotions are closely associated with sociality and relationship building, and so some devices and strategies can be employed to manage negative emotions for relationship management in social interactions.

In recent years, emotions or emotional issues in interaction have attracted more attention. For instance, how to do things with emotional expressions is a key issue from the speech act perspective (Scarantino 2017). Scarantino(2017), maintaining that the speech act theory can help to shed light on how emotional expressions convey social motives, proposes a framework of affective pragmatics for exploring the emotional expressions in practice. Within his framework emotions can do various things, similar to speech acts. The interrelatedness between impulsiveness and negative emotional behaviours has been investigated with a focus on destructive emotional arguments (Kienpointner 2008). Negative emotions are found to be destructive, and as a result, impulsiveness can be caused. This proves that (im)politeness is not purely linguistic but an emotional issue. In pragmatics, more attention is paid to emotions or emotional issues in different contexts and cultures, and a special volume on the sociopragmatics of emotion (Alba-Juez and Haugh, forthcoming) is being published. By taking a sociopragmatic perspective, the researchers take the indexical, social, and moral value of the expression of emotion in discourse and interaction into consideration. Such a relatively new approach to the study of emotions allows the readers to see the emotional phenomena in interpersonal, professional or institutional contexts in a clarifying and enriching light.

Dr. Lei's study has made contributions to the study of Chinese ganqing/感情 (emotional attachment or affection), to the study of interpersonal pragmatics in many aspects, and to the study of cultural pragmatics as well. Chinese is a language full of expressions of emotions, such as qinggan/情感 (emotion, affection), gongqing/共情 (empathy, sympathy), tongqing/同情 (sympathy, compassion), wenqing/温情 (tender feeling, warmth), rouqing/柔情 (tender feeling, tenderness), qinqing/亲情(love, affection), youqing/友情 (friendship, camaraderie), manyi/满意 (satisfaction), xihuan/喜欢 (like), and so on. Their variants are also included. Such

expressions or speech acts are related to interpersonal and even social issues, and they are key factors for building rapport and keeping harmony in a society. There exist differences between Chinese and other languages; some can be very subtle. In Chinese qing/情 (emotion) or ganqing/感情 (emotional attachment or affection) is a sensitive topic, which is quite context-bound. On the occasions of family talks or talking about family members, qing/情 (emotion) or ganqing/感情 (emotional attachment or affection) can be strongly loaded with affection (e.g. love or respect), but it might be relationship orientated on other occasions, such as showing a close or good relationship between the addressee(s). In interactions, participants tend to maintain, improve, or control qing/情 (emotion) or ganqing/感情 (emotional attachment or affection) for communicative purposes, but it can also be hurt or even damaged. Negative emotions such as bu xihuan/不喜欢 (dislike, disfavour), fangan/反感 (disgusting, antipathy), exin/恶心 (disgusting, nauseating), taoyan/讨厌 (disagreeable, dislike), fennu/愤怒 (angry), fenben/愤恨 (resent), or chouhen/仇恨(hatred, hostile) tend to cause unexpected outcomes. Impoliteness is one of the negative interpersonal effects. What is worse, it is also likely to bring various kinds of social disorders if negative emotions are not effectively managed. Thus, how to do emotion work or how to do things with emotions is a topic for further research from different perspectives and approaches.

The Pragmatics of Managing Negative Emotions in a Chinese Context is an investigation into ganqing in the Chinese sociocultural context from the perspective of interpersonal pragmatics. Several research gaps regarding emotions, the interplay between emotions and relational work, and emotion management have been addressed within interpersonal pragmatics. Rich Chinese culture-specific examples are provided. It can enrich our emic understanding of negative emotion management and fill some knowledge gaps concerning those underexplored issues of emotional pragmatics. It is a surprising fact that to date no book-length study has been dedicated to the theme. Hopefully, there are more studies from a pragmatic perspective about the functions of emotions in building and managing relationships, the strategic devices for emotion management, the interplay between emotions and (im)politeness or morality, and how to do relational work or things with emotions in the future. I recommend this study most sincerely: reading the present volume is a must.

# 1 Introduction

# 1.1 Motivation for the Pragmatic Study of Emotion Management

Research on emotion management has long been discussed in psychological works, involving both the issues of emotion self-management and the management of others' emotions (e.g., Thompson 1994; Greenberg 2017). Interest in managing emotions has continued growing over the years, especially in health settings. Such a trend is perhaps inevitable, given that managing patients' or clients' emotional status is always a necessity/premise for performing institutional tasks and achieving institutional goals of health communication. Yet despite there being increasing interest in emotion management, only comparatively few studies have explored it from a linguistic tradition (e.g., Ruusuvuori 2007; Voutilainen et al. 2010; Weiste 2016; Hartman 2019; Muntigl et al. 2023), let alone from the perspective of interpersonal pragmatics.

The interplay between perceived rapport and emotional reactions provides a theoretical foundation for examining emotion management from an interpersonal pragmatics perspective. In social interaction, people judge whether the rapport between themselves and others has been enhanced, challenged, or maintained. Threats to rapport tend to create negative emotional reactions (Spencer-Oatey 2005, 2011). Having identified the reasons for co-interlocutors' negative emotions, interlocutors can intervene to effectively manage co-interlocutors' perceptions of rapport, which would bring changes to co-interlocutors' emotional status. This is the foremost rationale behind this investigation.

Other rationales drive this research. First, the existing research on emotions is mainly approached from an outcome-orientated perspective, for instance, how emotions serve as a response to impoliteness/rapport threats (e.g., Spencer-Oatey 2002; Locher & Langlotz 2008; Culpeper 2011; Langlotz & Locher 2012, 2013, 2017). Little empirical research has taken a process-orientated approach, for instance, by examining how perceived rapport threats trigger emotions, and how to manage interlocutors'

emotions through 'relational work', which is assumed to change people's perceptions of rapport (Locher & Watts 2008: 96).

Second, it is mainly under the relational principles/moral orders of Western society or culture that the emotions are interpreted, which calls for an examination of cultural-specific principles/moral orders on the understanding of emotions. As Langlotz and Locher (2013) note, emotions are social and interpersonal phenomena, whose interpretation should be founded on the social and moral backgrounds in which they occur, and should also consider the social roles of interlocutors. Given that most of the existing research on interpersonal emotions is firmly located within Western, mostly English-speaking contexts (e.g., Spencer-Oatey 2005, 2011; Langlotz & Locher 2013, 2017), further studies are thus needed to take an indigenous perspective and to examine the influence of cultural-specific principles on the interpretation of emotions.

Thirdly, the prior research on emotion management has mainly been examined under the framework of conversation analysis (e.g., Voutilainen et al. 2010; Weiste 2016; Muntigl et al. 2017; Hartman 2019), without sufficient consideration of the pragmatic mechanisms underlying emotion management. Given the close link between emotions and interpersonal relationships (e.g., Andersen & Guerrero 1998; Langlotz & Locher 2013, 2017), we can take an interpersonal pragmatics approach and look at how interlocutors' perception of interpersonal relations affects emotion, and how to manage interlocutors' emotional status by impacting upon their perceptions of interpersonal relationships.

Fourthly, the Rapport Management Framework (RMF, Spencer-Oatey 2000, 2008), which focuses primarily on the management of relationships between direct interlocutors, does not fully explain how interlocutors manage harmonious/disharmonious relations that exist between co-interlocutors and non-present third parties (NPTPs). Further research is therefore needed to describe the operation of this type of rapport management.

In addition to the four motivations discussed above, this study is also based on the two possibilities. On the one hand, the psychotherapeutic interaction, which is emotionally intensive in a special way (Fiehler 1990; Pawelczyk 2011), can provide rich and valuable data for the exploration of interpersonal emotions through analyses of longer stretches of psychotherapeutic discourse, how interlocutors' negative emotions are dynamically constructed, what they point to, and how they are managed are observable for linguistic analysis (Langlotz & Locher 2017: 307-310). On the other hand, the meta-pragmatic comments made by interlocutors provide a lens

through which the interrelationship between emotions, principles/social norms/moral orders, and perceptions of rapport (i.e., the quality of the relationship) can be explored. Though interlocutors neither articulate their emotions directly nor refer to their relationship with others through labels such as 'rude', 'inattentive', or 'disrespectful', the 'emotion meta-comments' (Isik-Guler & Ruhi 2010: 638) and 'meta-pragmatic emotions' (Spencer-Oatey 2011) provide a set of linguistic resources that make people's perceptions of rapport, their perceptions regarding the observance or the violation of the social norms/expectations communicatively observable.

# 1.2 Situating the Interpersonal Pragmatics Study of Emotion Management in Psychotherapy Sessions

As a therapeutic school that is recommended for the treatment of depressed feelings, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a venue for clients' displays of negative emotions. Moreover, as a therapeutic school that is grounded on attachment theory and interpersonal theory (Klerman et al. 1984; Weissman et al. 2018), IPT focuses specifically on interpersonal relationships as a means of bringing about interpersonal change and symptomatic recovery, to help clients improve their interpersonal relationships (Stuart & Robertson 2015: 3). These make IPT sessions a rewarding site for exploring the displaying of emotions, the interplay between emotions and interpersonal relationships, as well as for the examination of emotion management. I will address the management of negative emotions in IPT by drawing the following example. The data is presented to illustrate the research object—negative emotions caused by disharmony (or discordant rapport) between the two parties.

In Turn 1, a client discloses the prior social interactions between her and her father. From the client's complaints directed toward her father, the disharmony between the client and her father is observed. The negative emotions are displayed when she discloses the disharmony that exists between her and her father. On the one hand, her anger towards her father is expressed through the speech act of complaints (Selting 2010, 2012) (Turn 1). On the other hand, a strong degree of sadness is displayed through vocal cues (i.e., sniffing, crying) (Hepburn & Potter 2007; Sorjonen & Peräkylä 2012). Locating these negative emotions within the interactional sequences in which they occur, they are responding to the disharmony between the client and her father (Locher & Langlotz 2008; Isik-Güler & Ruhi 2010). Importantly, it is the disharmony between the client and the NPTP, rather than the disharmony between the therapist and the client, that has triggered the client's negative emotions.

Extract 1-1 C, an adult in her thirties, talks about her prior interaction with her parents (C stands for the client, and T refers to the therapist).

Then I would have the feeling that I was the kid who was picked up, I only deserved to do housework at home… ((choking)). For example, when I wanted to watch TV, to relax, to stay with my parents, and to treat them as a family, they would rush me to study.

You finished your work, and then you could leave&#x27;. This was the way to drive me away ((sniffing)). But my younger brother was also watching TV at that time, and my brother was driven away as well, but often my brother would end up staying and I would leave.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>→</td><td>T: 是啊，你是那个寄人篱下的哦。你弟弟是可以任性一点的，你却没有资本任性。Yes, you are the one who is dependent on them for a living.

Maybe because my mother likes my younger brother, so does my father, and my mother doesn&#x27;t like me, so my father doesn&#x27;t like me either. &#x27;If your mother is happy, I might accept you&#x27;.</td></tr></table>

To understand the nature of the disharmony that exists between C and her father, the subsequent meta/comments made by C are analyzed. C, by complaining about her father's lack of feelings towards her ('I don't like you at all', Turn 1), and her parents' detachment from her ('my father, my mother, and my younger brother belonged to one family'; 'their words were a way of driving me away', Turn 1), projects negative assessment of her father's (also her mother's) behaviour, evoking evaluations of a threat to ganqing. According to Gao and Ting-Toomey (1998: 23-24), the affective dimensions of Chinese interpersonal relationships are guided by three relational principles, ganqing, renqing, and bao. Ganqing, which is usually found in 'long time and intimate social bonds' (Lee & Dawes 2005: 35), emphasizes 'affection and closeness' and emotional attachment in the parent-child relationship (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998: 24). Given the role relationship between C and her father, ganqing is considered to be the relational principle that underpins their interaction. From C's complaints, the content of which highlights emotional detachment, it can be drawn that it is her father's violation of the ganqing principle or her unmet ganqing expectation that has resulted in the disharmony between them and has evoked C's negative emotions.

What is discussed above indicates it is the ganqing violation-induced discordant rapport (hereafter GQVI discordant rapport) that exists between clients and NPTPs that has triggered clients' negative emotions. When confronted with negative emotions, therapists are expected and obliged to make some effort to manage them, given that managing clients' negative emotions is one of the most vital tasks therapists face in psychotherapeutic interactions (Pawelczyk 2011: 109). Then, what kind of efforts will be taken by therapists to manage clients' negative emotions, the following extract illustrates one of the many ways adopted by therapists.

Extract 1-2 C, an adult in her thirties, talks about her prior interaction with her parents.

Rather than responding directly to C's negative emotions, T speaks on behalf of C's father by mentioning the difficulties he encounters ('your father might think—the biggest problem for him, the biggest problem to solve is your mother', Turn 8). In so doing, T aims to account for C's father's inappropriate behaviour—treating the daughter in an emotionally detached way. From C's response in the next turns (i.e., the formulation of T's utterance), it can be drawn that the account offered by T on behalf of C's father is accepted and acknowledged by C (Lerner 2004; Vehviläinen 2008). The acceptance of the account indicates the restoration of the social order and the bridging of the gap between action and expectation (Scott & Lyman 1968: 46; Firth 1995: 200). As for C's emotional status, a positive change in her emotional status is observable both from her 'verbal descriptions of the emotional states' (Langlotz & Locher 2012: 1601) in Turn 23 and the voice cues when she speaks at the later part of the extract (i.e., she speaks in a normal pitched voice, compared with her sobbing and crying sound at the beginning of this extract, cf. Extract 1-1).

The analysis of the therapist's utterances in Extract 1-2 exemplifies one way employed by therapists to manage clients' negative emotions (i.e., anger and sadness) caused by GQVI discordant rapport during Chinese psychotherapy sessions. Are there any other types of negative emotions evoked by the GQVI discordant rapport that exists between clients and NPTPs? Are there any other ways employed by therapists to manage clients' negative emotions? Is there any factor that would influence therapists' choice of ways when manage clients' negative emotions? These are the key questions to be explored.

Additionally, when therapists manage the disharmony that exists between clients and NPTPs, they speak for NPTPs and provide accounts on their behalf, a phenomenon which is termed 'surrogacy' according to Mazer et al. (2014: 38). Such a way of rapport management, given that it is not the direct rapport management between therapists and clients, but rather a type of rapport management that involves therapists'

undertaking of surrogate roles in managing the rapport between clients and NPTPs, it is termed surrogate-based rapport management in this study. Accordingly, the linguistic strategies taken by therapists to manage the disharmony between clients and NPTPs are termed surrogate-based rapport management strategies.

# 1.3 Objectives of the Study

Based on the motivations/rationales presented in Section 1.1 and the research object exemplified above, this study aims to explore how therapists manage clients' negative emotions through managing GQVI discordant rapport. The following three research questions guide this research:

(1) What types of negative emotions do clients display when they disclose the GQVI discordant rapport that exists between them and NPTPs during psychotherapy sessions? How are these negative emotions displayed?

The task here is to discover the types of negative emotions clients display when GQVI discordant rapport (i.e., unmet ganqing expectation-induced disharmony or unfulfilled ganqing expectation-induced disharmony) is being disclosed. The identification and classification of these emotions are based on the following emotional cues: (a) the verbal cues (e.g., language-specific emotion words/vocabularies, speech acts) and vocal cues (e.g., voice quality) that are documented in the literature (Planalp 1998; Hepburn & Potter 2007; Selting 2010; Prior 2016; Räabis et al. 2019) and ways for implicating emotions (Langlotz & Locher 2012) will be referenced for the identification of different types of negative emotions; and (b) the types of negative emotions, which involve both self-conscious emotions, other-condemning emotions (Haidt 2003; Culpeper 2011), and sadness, are discussed under the types of GQVI discordant rapport.

In addition to focusing on the types of negative emotions, the study also explores how emotions are named and expressed. For instance, whether they are implicitly or explicitly manifested, and whether the models of emotional displays are associated with the sociocultural backgrounds of the interactants (e.g., high-context culture or low-context culture).

(2) How are these negative emotions managed by therapists through surrogate-based rapport management strategies?

Therapists are dedicated to managing the disharmony between clients and NPTPs when they are managing clients' negative emotions, given that it is the disharmony between clients and NPTPs that has evoked these emotions. Drawing on the RMF, the participation structure of dyadic therapist-client

interactions (the two actual participants are the therapist and the client, and the NPTP is the virtual participant), and the discourse role therapists undertake when they are managing the disharmony between clients and NPTPs, surrogate-based RMF is proposed. Based on these, different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies employed by therapists to manage negative emotions are examined.

(3) Why do therapists employ different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies to manage these negative emotions?

The contextual factor that influences therapists' choice of the types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies will be discussed. The social distance between clients and NPTPs, that is, whether it is featured as a higher degree of intimacy or a lower degree of intimacy is found to be a key factor that influences therapists' employment of surrogate-based rapport management strategies when managing clients' negative emotions.

The objectives of the book are aimed at proposing a ganqing approach to rapport (management) and bringing broader im/politeness insights. On the one hand, the analysis will show how violation of the cultural-specific ganqing principle results in damaged rapport between two parties, adding to recent work on rapport (management).

The threats to the harmonious relationship, therefore, are not limited to face-threatening behaviour; equity rights/association rights-threatening behaviour, renqing-threatening behaviour, qingmian-threatening behaviour, and ganqing-threatening behaviour are also involved. On the other hand, the Chinese concept of ganqing, which encompasses concern for the feelings of others by showing consideration and attentiveness, resonates with many previous discussions on politeness. For instance, Kádár and Pan (2010) argue that showing emotional 'warmth' (wenqing,温情) is a demonstration of politeness in Chinese communication. Zhai (2006) finds that 'real' emotions constitute an important part of politeness in mainland China, and Fukushima and Haugh (2014) analyze attentiveness (title/zhoudao,体贴/周到) as the moral order that underpins evaluations of im/politeness by Chinese-Taiwanese participants. Other studies (Gu 1990; Ruhi 2009) also discuss the interrelationship between emotion and politeness. Therefore, an exploration into ganqing in the Chinese sociocultural context would enrich the emic understanding of politeness (Zhao & Ran 2019), which remains largely underexplored.

The whole book, which revolves around the three research questions above, encompasses nine chapters. This chapter offers a general introduction, including the motivations, rationales, and objectives of

the research. The research object is further exemplified by drawing on interpersonal psychotherapist-client conversations in a Chinese context. The contents of the remaining chapters are as follows. Chapter 2 works towards an interpersonal pragmatics analysis of emotion management. Prior research on emotion and emotion management is reviewed, in particular, the role of rapport management in emotion management is laid out. These early studies are argued to be the foundation on which the conceptual framework is built. Chapter 3 focuses on proposing a ganqing approach to rapport (management). Its necessity, its components, and its application in pragmatics research are discussed. The conceptual framework of the study is introduced in Chapter 4. The rationale for choosing Spencer-Oatey's RMF as the theoretical foundation, the explanatory power when applying analysis to interlocutors' management of disharmony between co-interlocutors and NPTPs, and the solutions for the deficiencies are presented. Then, a rapport-based RMF is put forth and the model of rapport-orientated management of negative emotions is proposed.

Chapter 5 deals with data and methods, including the data sources, data features, standards for coding negative emotions, standards for coding GQVI discordant rapport, standards for coding surrogate-based rapport management strategies, the interactional approach for analyzing the data, and the dimensions for observing the effect of therapists' intervention on clients' negative emotions. Chapter 6 lays out the types of negative emotions clients display when disclosing the GQVI discordant rapport that exists between them and NPTPs. The different types of GQVI discordant rapport and the rapport threats are also presented. Chapter 7 examines how different types of negative emotions are managed by therapists via different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies. Chapter 8 accounts for therapists' use of different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies when managing clients' negative emotions. Chapter 9 is a summary of the major research findings. The theoretical and practical implications, the limitations, and the future directions are discussed.

# 2 Towards an Interpersonal Pragmatics Analysis of Emotion Management

# 2.1 Introduction

This chapter works towards an interpersonal pragmatics analysis of emotion management. More specifically, it focuses on the interplay between evaluations of rapport and emotional reactions, and how perceptions of disharmony evoke negative emotions in particular. I will start with definitions and expressions of emotions, and then move to the causes of negative emotions. The focus will be on the relational triggers of negative emotions and rapport/relationship management. The final section of this chapter outlines the under-researched area of negative emotions and their management, which serves as the rationale behind the study of emotion management from an interpersonal pragmatics approach, as well as the foundation for proposing the conceptual framework of the study.

# 2.2 Definitions and Linguistic Expressions of Emotions

# 2.2.1 Definitions of Emotions

Emotions are conceptualized as socially and culturally shaped products in the eyes of linguists (Harré 1986; Goddard 2002). Like the nature of emotions in linguistics, emotions in the field of pragmatics are not psychological entities or inner psychological status (Planalp 1999), but rather 'externalized and communicative phenomenon' and 'socially and culturally shaped and malleable products' (Langlotz & Locher 2013:91). Emotions are not individual phenomena but rather interactive phenomena that are emergent in social interaction (Günthner 2011; Sorjonen & Peräkylä 2012; Langlotz & Locher 2017).

# 2.2.2 Types of Emotions

Broadly speaking, emotions can be classified as positive and negative emotions (Eisenberg et al. 1998). Positive emotions consist of emotion types such as love, joy, desire, etc., while negative emotions refer to feelings

that people want to avoid, sadness, fear, and anger being the typical ones. To describe the emotions that are closely associated with social norms and cultural expectations of a society or community, the notion of moral emotions is proposed (Haidt 2003; Tangney et al. 2007). According to Haidt (2003), moral emotions are 'those emotions that are linked to the interest or welfare either of society as a whole or at least of a person other than the judge or agent' (p.853). Moreover, Haidt (2003) argues that typical moral emotions can be identified from two dimensions: (1) whether these emotions are self-interested or disinterested, and (2) whether these emotions result in moral, prosocial actions. He further distinguishes two types of negatively valenced moral emotions: (1) other-condemning emotions, which involve anger, disgust, and contempt; and (2) self-conscious emotions, which encompass embarrassment, shame, and guilt. As for sadness, it is low on both counts mentioned above. According to Culpeper (2011: 61), sadness involves 'self-concern and results in lethargy or actions to help the self'. Based on this classification, Culpeper (2011) discusses the interconnections between the type of negatively valenced moral emotions and the type of impoliteness perceived by interlocutors. Impoliteness triggered by violations of sociality rights is probably followed by other-condemning emotions of anger, disgust, and contempt, while threats to one's face are more likely to evoke self-conscious emotions such as embarrassment and shame.

The emotions concerned in this study involve both other-condemning emotions (i.e., anger) and self-conscious emotions (i.e., guilt). Sadness is also widely observed. Rather than displaying alone, sadness is always accompanied by anger or guilt. According to Langlotz and Locher (2017: 310), under some circumstances, interlocutors are entangled in the emotional 'interaction chains' (i.e., emotions that trigger further emotions). In line with this argument, sadness in this study is considered a type of negative emotion triggered by anger or guilt.

# 2.2.3 Linguistic Expressions of Emotions

As a social construct, one's emotional status can be displayed through complex patterns of emotional cues. Adopting a two-partite distinction, Ochs and Schieffelin (1989) argue that emotions are displayed non-verbally and/or verbally. The non-verbal means involves facial expressions, gestures, and body orientation; while the verbal means of emotional signaling encompasses an emotional lexicon and grammatical and discourse structures. Clark (1996) maintains that emotions can be expressed through describing (e.g., I am sad), indicating (e.g., pointing one's finger toward someone as a bodily indication of anger), and demonstrating (e.g., imitating the furious expression of the interlocutor during a conflictual event). According to Planalp (1998), emotions are

signalled through vocal cues, verbal cues, body cues, physiological cues, and facial cues. Fiehler (2002) argues that emotions are expressed in the following ways: experiential declarative formulas (e.g., I feel sad); frozen metaphorical idioms (e.g., it boils within me), and the metaphorical use of expressions (e.g., I was completely blocked). Similarly, Schwarz-Friesel (2007) contends that emotions can be signalled through verbal expression, visual intensification, verbal descriptions, and meta/comments.

More emotion-signaling strategies are reported. Drawing on an ethnographical approach, Samra-Fredericks (2010) observes that emotions can be expressed verbally through emotive labels, and non-verbal cues such as frowning, clenched fists, and clenched teeth. Other cues, such as the tempo of voice and the emphasis on specific words or phrases, are also important indicators of emotions. By investigating data collected from the Mailonline site, Langlotz and Locher (2012) find that interlocutors' emotional stances are signalled through expressions (e.g., exclamations, intensification, name-calling, verbalization of emotional reactions, smileys, interjections, and emotional constructions); implications, lexical connotations, metaphors, and their stylistic implications; emotion words, verbal descriptions/ascription of emotional states. Analyzing data from the Chinese discussion forum, Gong (2014) reports that online commentators mainly use the emotional strategies of direct expression, implicit indexing, and explicit description to index their emotional stances in online conflictive commentaries. In a recent study, Raabis et al. (2019) examine the linguistic means used by the complainant to express and name emotions in Estonian school-related complaints. Syntactic means, lexical means (e.g., intensifiers and exaggerations, extreme case formulations, swear words), rhetorical means (e.g., repetition, rhetorical question, irony, imitations), and naming emotions are frequently used.

Generally speaking, interlocutors' emotional statuses are communicated through linguistic and paralinguistic resources, so a composite means of emotion representation is always adopted. What's more, multi-modal analyses of emotions have been developed in the ethnography of communication (Goodwin & Goodwin 2001; Goodwin et al. 2002; Garcés-Conejos Blitvich 2022). These reviews shed light on the recognition of clients' negative emotions. Emotion lexicon, implications, meta-pragmatic emotions, the speech act of complaints, vocal cues, and prosodic cues such as crying, and sniffing, are the main emotional cues that are referred to in this study.

# 2.3 Causes of Negative Emotions

In linguistic studies, the nature of negative emotions and their causes is discussed. This section reviews the causes of negative emotions in the field of linguistics with an emphasis on studies in the field of pragmatics.

# 2.3.1 Linguistic Studies on Causes of Negative Emotions

Though the research topic of emotions has been extensively explored in linguistic studies, only several of them have touched upon the causes of negative emotions. For instance, it is reported that negative emotions are associated with frustrating situations. Neglect, abuse, and trauma are all incidents that give rise to negative emotions (Paivio & Pascual-Leone 2010; Muntigl et al. 2017). Other scholars (e.g., Jones 2001; Guerrero & La Valley 2006; Langlotz & Locher 2013) argue that negative emotions are closely related to conflict issues. In Guerrero and La Valley (2006), an interconnection between emotion types and their causes in conflict situations is reported: anger and annoyance are related to face attack, aggression, threat, unfairness, inequity, or incompetent behaviours; while the feelings of hurt and irritation are caused by conflict types such as accusations, threats, negative evaluations, lies, irony, or sarcasm. Guilt, with subtypes of shame, embarrassment, and regret, is correlated with relational/role obligations, normative standards, or being considered as worse by others.

The above literature indicates that negative emotions have their elicitors, including frustrating situations, and discrepancies in claims or beliefs (e.g., disagreements or conflicts between interlocutors). Some relational factors, such as face threats, are mentioned vaguely. This limitation motivates the exploration of negative emotions from an interpersonal pragmatics perspective and examines the underlying causes of negative emotions.

# 2.3.2 Pragmatic Studies on Triggers of Negative Emotions

In pragmatic literature, negative emotions are evoked by face threat/impoluteness (e.g., Goffman 1967; Culpeper 2011; Langlotz& Locher 2012; Vergis & Terkourafi 2015), and rapport threat (Spencer-Oatey 2002, 2005, 2008; Spencer-Oatey & Xing 2003; Spencer-Oatey & Franklin 2009).

(1) Face threat. The strong link between face and emotion has been discussed in early works. In Goffman's (1955, 1967) introduction of face into the academic world, face is referred to as 'the positive social value a person effectively claims for himself by the line others assume he has taken during a particular contact' (Goffman 1955: 213). According to him, face is both an individual and collective concept, the threatening or losing of which would bring emotional consequences. Individually, if an event fails to establish a face a person might have expected, he will 'feel bad' or 'feel hurt' (Goffman 1967: 6). Collectively, the members share a face in many relationships, thus a member's improper act when in the presence of a third party would become 'a source of acute embarrassment to the other members' (ibid: 41). In Brown

and Levinson's politeness theory, face is conceptualized as 'the public self-image that every member wants to claim for himself' (Brown & Levinson 1987: 61) and two types of face are distinguished. Positive face concerns one's desire to be approved by others, while negative face involves one's desire to be unimpeded in his/her actions. Furthermore, face is a vulnerable phenomenon associated with emotional reactions. Ting-Toomey and Cocroft (1994) observe that if one's face is violated, feelings of anxiety are unavoidable. Shimanoff (1994) uses the term 'face-threatening emotions' to describe the close link between face and emotions. People react with embarrassment when he/she loses face.

More studies have supported the interlink between face threats and negative emotions. For instance, Spencer-Oatey (2007) states that 'face is associated with affective sensitivity' (p. 644). If one's face is damaged or threatened, emotional reactions like anger (e.g., irritation, frustration) and sadness (e.g., displeasure, shame/guilt, embarrassment/insult) would follow. Similarly, Ruhi (2009) contends that damage to one's face gives rise to emotional reactions such as embarrassment, shame, and anger. Gerholm (2011) maintains that children's perceptions of face threats are associated with sadness and embarrassment.

Examining interlocutors' emotional reactions from the perspective of face threat illuminates the understanding of clients' negative emotions in this study. Since face concerns primarily people's public self-image, therefore, interpersonal interactions that occur within the context of family or between close friends without outsiders are less sensitive to face. A synthesized examination of the interactional environment, an interlocutor's role, each party's rights, and obligations, and morality-based expectations are needed when a participant's negative emotions are to be interpreted (Langlotz & Locher 2013, 2017).

(2) Impoliteness. As a derivational concept of traditional politeness theory, impoliteness has attracted abundant research attention over the years. Scholars have examined the impoliteness phenomenon in a variety of interpersonal contexts such as military training discourse (e.g., Culpeper 1996; Bousfield 2007), computer-mediated interaction (Graham 2007; Bou-Franch & Garcés-Conejos Blitvich 2014), classroom settings (Dobs & Garcés-Conejos Blitvich 2013), local governance meetings (Tracy 2008), legal discourse (e.g., Archer 2011), mediation contexts (Zhao & Ran 2019), political discourse (e.g., Zhou 2020; Zhu & Zhu 2022), etc.

The interplay between morality, impulsiveness, and people's emotional reactions is frequently discussed. On the one hand, the evaluation of

impoliteness is based on social norms or relational principles (e.g., Culpeper 2005, 2011; Locher & Watts 2008; Tayebi 2016). The notion of morality, which concerns the obligations associated with interlocutors, is made clear by Goffman (1967: 49) in his early work:

Rules of conduct impinge upon the individual in two general ways: directly, as obligations establishing how he is morally constrained to conduct himself; indirectly as expectations, establishing how others are morally bound to act concerning him.

The violation of social norms leads to evaluations of immorality and evaluations of impoliteness (Culpeper 2011). When social norms are infringed, the offences interlocutors perceive can be reflected through their responses or counter-arguments to co-interlocutors (Parvaresh & Tayebi 2018).

On the other hand, negative emotional reactions are the result of impolite acts/events (e.g., Culpeper 2011; Langlotz & Locher 2012, 2013; Garcés-Conejos Blitvich 2013). In Isik-Güler (2008), the acts or events which might give rise to negative emotions involve face attacks, rights offences, expressive impulsiveness, inattentiveness to others, disregard of custom, aggressive/offensive self-presentation, self-emotion mismanagement, physical and mental bullying. It is widely accepted that impulsiveness leads to negative emotions. For instance, Culpeper (1996) maintains that 'impoliteness strategies are orientated towards attacking face, an emotionally sensitive concept of the self' (p. 350).

The association between emotions and impulsiveness has been further examined from a cross-cultural perspective. Culpeper et al. (2014) address the question of whether people from different cultures experience different emotions when they are confronted with impulsiveness events. An analysis of 500 reports of impulsiveness events generated by undergraduates from England, Finland, Germany, Turkey, and China finds that key concepts such as 'face' and 'sociality rights' are closely related to specific emotions; cognition plays an essential role in the interpretation of impulsiveness. The results show fewer cultural variations at a higher level of emotional categories, but more at the sub-level of emotions.

Data from more contextual settings support the claim that impoliteness would evoke negative emotions. Locher and Watts (2005) contend that impolite verbal behaviours such as coercive impositions, insults, and threats, tend to trigger negative emotions. Analyzing military training discourse, Bousfield (2007) reports that military impoliteness is marked based on two factors: one concerns the ability to create an emotional response in recruits, and the other concerns the ability to make soldiers obey the order. Drawing upon asynchronous online newspaper comments, Langlotz and Locher (2012) report how disagreements among online readers reflect

face attacks and how the disagreements between interlocutors escalate into interpersonal conflicts, resulting in interlocutors' negative emotional displays.

The close link between impulsiveness and emotion is also reflected in the way impulsiveness is defined. In Kienpointer (2008), impulsiveness is referred to as 'a kind of prototypically non-cooperative or competitive communicative behaviour' which disrupts interpersonal relations and creates the 'emotional atmosphere of mutual irrelevance and antipathy' (p. 245). More studies support the argument that interlocutors have a range of emotional reactions when they perceive impulsiveness (e.g., Dobs & Gracés-Conejos Blitvich 2013).

In sum, the existing research on impulsiveness enlightens the understanding of negative emotions in interpersonal communication. That is, negative emotions can either be the result of impulsiveness or the trigger of impolite behaviours. Moreover, it is based on moral order that people make judgments on social acts, about whether they are polite or impolite.

(3) Rapport threat. People's perceptions of rapport or dynamic assessment of the bases of rapport often result in significant emotional reactions. The definition of rapport varies slightly in Spencer-Oatey's works. In her early studies, rapport is referred to as 'the relative harmony and smoothness of relations between people' (Spencer-Oatey 2005: 96). In Spencer-Oatey and Franklin (2009), the scope of rapport has been expanded and it is referred to as 'people's subjective perceptions of (dis)harmony, smoothness-turbulence, and warmth-antagonism in interpersonal relations' (p. 102). Whatever definition the researcher adopts, the bases of rapport include face sensitivities, behavioural expectations, and interactional goals. When people interact with each other, they make dynamic judgments as to whether they have gained face, or lost face, whether their behavioural expectations have been met, and whether their interactional goals have been achieved. People's dynamic judgment of rapport is accompanied by their emotional responses (Spencer-Oatey 2005: 116).

The claim that perceptions of rapport are associated with people's emotional reactions is supported empirically. Based on interview data from participants of four different workplace project partnerships, Spencer-Oatey (2011) reports the interconnection between interpersonal relationships and emotions. Drawing on interviewees' meta-pragmatic emotional comments, the relational issues or relational matters among participants are studied. In workplace settings where people focus more on goal-related issues, people's meta-pragmatic emotional comments could conceptualize 'the relational' in pragmatics in a better way than the evaluative judgments of others' (im)politeness. In a study that explores

relating at work from the grassroots perspective, Spencer-Oatey (2013) proposes a model to delineate the facets of 'relating at work'. The relational atmosphere, relational networks, contextual factors, relational dynamics, relating goals, and relating strategies are the major constituents. People's emotional reactions, identity dynamics, and rapport dynamics are the three sub-components of relational dynamics.

Culpeper's (2011) study further supports the interconnection between perceptions of rapport and emotional reactions. Rather than directly focusing on people's perception of rapport, he explores the interpersonal relationship from the perspective of impoliteness (Culpeper 2011: 48). When interlocutors' quality face is offended, the dominant emotional reaction would be sadness, followed by anger and fear; when interlocutors' equity rights are violated, it would evoke negative emotions of sadness, fear, and emotions of being threatened, intimated, or offended, etc. When people's association rights are violated, negative emotions of sadness, anger, and fear tend to ensue.

A review of Spencer-Oatey's work and the relevant ones has important implications for this study: (1) people's dynamic perceptions/assessments/judgments on the nature of interpersonal relations (i.e., whether it is smooth, disharmonious, conflictual) tend to have a great impact on one's emotional status. (2) People's assessments/judgments on rapport can be observed from the meta-pragmatic emotion comments they made to the relational issues or relational matters. The meta-pragmatic emotion comments can provide a window for people to observe rapport/interpersonal relations. (3) The association between perceptions of rapport and people's emotional reactions is mainly examined in Western academia, with few indigenous studies having been done. For a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between rapport and emotion types, it is necessary to expand the research by examining relational issues in a wider variety of interactional environments and sociocultural contexts.

# 2.4 Management of Negative Emotions in Linguistic Studies

The major concern of this section is to review the prior linguistic studies on emotion management. Broadly speaking, emotion management distinguishes between the self-management of emotion and the interactional management of emotion (Beebe & Lachmann 2002: 22). Self-management, which concerns the 'regulatory processes within individuals' (Peräkylä & Ruusuvuori 2012: 91), has been mainly discussed in psychological studies and communication studies (e.g., Planalp 1999; Greenberg 2004; Gross & Thompson 2007). For instance, Planalp (1999) proposes two strategies for managing emotions in interpersonal communications: (a) surface acting, which concerns how the communicators alter their emotional status through stimulating, intensifying, prohibiting, or masking their emotional

expressions, to adapt to the appropriate means of emotional display; and (b) deep acting, which concerns communicators' attempt to change their inner emotional states. It involves practices such as readjusting appraisals to certain events, avoiding negative emotion-sensitive events, and changing one's psychological reactions by taking medications. The interactional management of emotions, which has been predominantly investigated in linguistic studies (e.g., sociolinguistic studies, conversation analysis, and pragmatic studies), will be reviewed and critically commented on to highlight the key empirical gaps.

# 2.4.1 Prior Linguistic Studies on Emotion Management in Non-institutional Settings

The displays of emotions and their interactional management are discussed in everyday interactions. Drawing on face-to-face complaint storytelling, Selting (2010) examines how the teller displays anger or indignation through rhetorical, lexico-semantic, syntactic, and phonetic-phonological resources, and how the recipients react to the tellers' negative emotions by enacting a matching emotion. In Selting (2012), the ways through which the recipient of complaint stories react to the tellers' negative emotions are examined. Specifically, the recipient tunes with the teller through 'tellings of a complaint story of their own' (p. 387). Couper-Kuhlen (2012) reports that the recipients match the complaint storytellers' negative emotions through prosodic matching. Examining news announcements between strangers in the context of homestays, Maynard and Freese (2012) find that the recipient reacts to the positive valence or negative valence reflected in the news by using matching prosodic cues. Such a way of reacting contributes to interpersonal harmony and creates a sense of sharedness. In the context of the telling of amusing stories, Selting (2017) reports that affiliation is the recipient's preferred response to the teller's affectivities.

In sum, the recipient's tuning with or affiliating with the speaker's display of emotions (both positive emotions and negative emotions) is the preferred means of managing emotions in daily interactions. Reacting in such a way is constructive to the relational harmony between the two parties.

# 2.4.2 Prior Linguistic Studies on Emotion Management in Institutional Settings

Compared with emotion management in mundane interactions, the management of emotions in institutional contexts is more goal-orientated. The relevant literature will be reviewed by the types of institutional settings. Firstly, the interaction between doctors and patients in general medical settings involves emotion management. Diagnostic news delivery is an

activity in which the management of emotions is highly relevant (Maynard & Frankel 2006; Heritage & Lindström 2012). For instance, when doctors are delivering bad news to patients, they tend to preface it with hesitations, and neutral or even positive evaluations. Doctors' shrouding of bad news in such a manner indicates that they have pre-empted the negative influence that the bad news might have brought on the patient's emotional status. Additionally, when patients are describing their troubles, the moment which is characterized by patients' negative emotions, the professionals respond by displaying understanding, expressing compassion, or aligning with patients' talk (Ruusuvuori 2007).

Secondly, psychotherapy and counselling are rewarding sites for exploring emotion management, given that clients' mental and emotional transformation is the primary institutional task of psychotherapeutic interaction (e.g., Antaki et al. 2007; Pawelczyk 2011; Peräkylä & Sorjonen 2012). The analyses reveal the following:

(a) (Re)formulation has been a key resource therapists use to manage clients' negative emotions (Rae 2008). Weiste (2016) finds that when psychiatric clinicians are confronted with outpatients' maladaptive emotional states during their self-disclosure of emotion-related experiences, they adopt two formulation sequences to manage negative emotions. In the first, the clinician recognizes what has been described by the outpatients as valid. In the second, the clinician redirects the outpatient's troublesome experiences through the formulation sequences.

(b) The role of grammatical resources in managing negative emotions is explored. Hartman (2019) examines how what-if conditional constructions are utilized by therapists and clients to manage tasks that are relevant to emotions. Clients use what-if constructions to express worry and doubt, while therapists use what-if constructions to manage clients' emotions since these constructions can re-frame clients' worries, provide an alternative perspective for clients' reference, and stimulate positive changes.

(c) Specific interactional structures (i.e., chair work) have been employed by therapists to manage clients' negative emotions. Drawing naturally occurring data from emotion-focused psychotherapy sessions, Muntigl et al. (2017) investigate how therapists use 'chair work' to guide clients to talk about a conflicted aspect of self or with non-present significant others to cope with their unresolved negative emotions.

(d) The practices of recognition and interpretation are also resources that are used by therapists to manage patients' negative emotional status, as reported by Voutilainen et al. (2010). Pawelczyk (2011) maintains that therapists can provide emotional support and manage emotions

by aligning with clients' prior turn emotionally (e.g., using the grammatical form of interjection), validating or normalizing client's situation, and mirroring (e.g., therapists referencing their own experiences) (Pawelczyk 2011: 187-195).

Thirdly, telephone helplines, emergency call lines and airlines are institutional sites where emotion management is investigated (e.g., Whalen & Zimmerman 1998; Shaw & Kitzinger 2013; Widdershoven et al. 2021). Drawing on 911 calls, Whalen and Zimmerman (1998) examine how the call takers respond to callers' affective displays (e.g., crying, expressions of sorrow), the latter of which would negatively influence the communicative exchange. To facilitate the collection of essential information and to keep track of interaction, call takers actively manage their own and callers' emotions by taking practices such as remaining calm, using directives (e.g., calming down), and consoling the caller. Fuoli and Bednarek (2021) draw on data from the Twitter profiles of 13 major airlines to explore how an agent handles callers' emotions as well as managing his/her own.

In sum, the relational issues in causing and managing emotions have been overlooked in the prior studies. Since the research object of this study is negative emotions and interpersonal interaction is the most important elicitor, it is necessary to consider the role of rapport management in the process of emotion management.

# 2.5 Rapport Management in Emotion Management

# 2.5.1 Necessity of Rapport Management

The term 'relational management' adopted by Isik-Güler and Ruhi (2010: 629) is similar to the 'rapport management' proposed by Spencer-Oatey (2005), both of which concern 'the management (mismanagement) of relations between people' (ibid: 96). The interconnection between emotion and rapport management has been characterized as bi-directional. On the one hand, (mis)management of relationships often results in significant emotional reactions. On the other hand, (mis)management of relationships can be triggered by specific emotions (e.g., Isik-Güler & Ruhi 2010; Vergis & Terkourafi 2015). In what follows, the dimensions of rapport management in negative emotion management are reviewed.

# 2.5.2 Dimensions of Rapport Management

# (1) Managing Rapport Threats

Previous work indicates that emotions are not only a product of face and a reflection of changes in face, but they also motivate the changes in face status through facework practices (e.g., Ruhi & Isik-Güler 2007; Locher

& Langlotz 2008; Gerholm 2011; Qi 2011; Ran & Zhao 2018). Negative emotions are the drivers of facework practices, and these practices concern how an interlocutor controls his/her embarrassment (Goffman 1967: 13). Two types of facework practices are proposed: avoidance facework practices and corrective facework practices. The avoidance facework is employed by a person to prevent threats to his/her face, while corrective facework functions to restore face when one's face has been at risk or has been lost.

Facework and facework strategies have been extensively discussed (e.g., Brown 1977; Brown & Levinson 1987; Penman 1990; Lim & Bowers 1991; Cupach & Metts 1994; Shimanoff 1994; Ting-Toomey & Kurogi 1998; Locher & Watts 2005; Archer & Jagodzinski 2015). Among these studies, some scholars examine facework from an avoidance or a preventive perspective, while others concentrate on the interactional process it undergoes. According to Brown and Levinson (1987), facework is limited to the redressing of face threat to maintaining face equilibrium. Similarly, Locher and Watts (2005) consider facework as an appropriate and polite behaviour that is used to mitigate face threats.

When the interlocutor's face has been at risk and it has resulted in negative emotional reactions, corrective or restorative facework practices are expected. In addition to the notion of 'corrective facework' (Goffman 1967), restorative facework is noted in Brown (1977). This type of facework concerns the actions taken to 'repair damage to lost face [and are] occurring in response to events that have already transpired. Thus, it is past-orientated and defensive' (Brown 1977: 281).

There is a rich body of work concerning how interlocutors repair or rehabilitate face through restorative facework practices, with accounting functioning as an important means of achieving this. Scott and Lyman (1968) note that accounts are 'talk used to transform pejorative ascriptions and resolve problematic events' (Buttny 1993: 16). The role of emotion and affect in accounting transgressive behaviour is explicitly manifested in Buttny (1993). The negative emotions resulting from transgressive behaviours (i.e., face threat) motivate the enactment of accounting practices. Some accounting practices and their linguistic realizations are discussed. In Holtgraves' (1992) study, four types of accounting strategies that function as face support are reported: (1) justification: admitting responsibility but minimizing offensiveness; (2) excuse: admitting offensiveness but minimizing responsibility; (3) concession: admitting offensiveness and responsibility; and (4) refusal: admitting nothing. Since accounts can change the original meaning (usually the worst possible reading or virtual offences) that interlocutors might have given to action, accounts thus have a face-preserving or rehabilitating function.

The role of face management in negative emotion management has been supported by empirical studies in the field of pragmatics. Drawing on

parent-child interaction, Gerholm (2011) reports on the moments when children's negative emotions arise due to face threats. These children, when they are rejected by peers, their misconceptions are disclosed by others, or they are commented on by their peers as lacking sufficient knowledge, would display negative emotions (e.g., crying, changing prosody, and changing facial expressions). These surfaced emotions, which encompass sadness, embarrassment, shame, and hurt, are linked to the notion of face, i.e., the children react to their threatened dignity and self-esteem unpleasantly by displaying these negative emotions. Children's negative emotions have motivated parental facework practices since the parents try to restore face on the children's behalf. For instance, when a child exhibits sadness because of interpersonal rejection, the explanation (i.e., a kind of facework) is enacted by the mother to restore the child's threatened self-esteem. When a child feels embarrassed because a misconception is disclosed by others, the father clarifies the confusion and bypasses the predicament, aiming to help the child restore face.

Based on data collected from intervention-based reality TV, Gordon (2011) examines the ways that parents negotiate parental responsibilities for their kids' poor eating and exercising habits and simultaneously repair their parental face and the threatened identities. The practice of accounting is utilized by parents to deal with face threats.

Interlocutors' emotional reactions play a significant role in social accounts, the latter of which can explain behaviour, repair fractured social interaction, and thus manage interlocutors' negative emotions.

In addition to excuses, facework practices of justifications, physical remediation, avoidance, and apologies are frequently utilized by interlocutors to heal damaged relationships or to reassert one's capabilities (Brown 1977; Cupach & Metts 1994; Ting-Toomey 2004). Since face and facework are culture-specific notions, some cultural-unique facework practices are reported. For instance, Al Zidjaly (2012) reports that when Muslims' identities are attacked on the website of Al Jazeera—a noted Arabian political news agency—linguistic practices such as 'self-attack' and 'self-praise' are employed by Muslim Arabs to save their collective face.

To sum up, accounting serves as an important facework practice as well as a linguistic practice to manage negative emotions caused by face threats. Moreover, there is a lack of empirical research that examines the role of face management in negative emotion management.

# (2) Managing Behavioural Expectations

Behavioural expectations are one of the three major bases on which people make judgments or assessments about the quality of their interpersonal relations with others (Spencer-Oatey & Franklin 2009). It is based

on principles, behavioural conventions, rituals, norms, protocols, and contractual or legal agreements that people use to make judgments about the social appropriateness of behaviours. People use evaluative comments (e.g., warm, friendly, considerate, respectful, rude) to reflect their perceptions of social relations and the rapport between interlocutors (Spencer-Oatey 2005, 2011).

People's judgments or assessments regarding whether their behavioural expectancies are met can often evoke/elicit significant emotional reactions, either the emotions of themselves or the emotional reactions of others. The emotions, especially negative emotions need to be handled properly if the interactional goals are concerned and the interpersonal relations are taken into consideration. Very few studies have examined emotion management triggered by unmet behavioural expectations. One exception can be found in Ho (2017), who, drawing on negative reviews posted by travellers on websites such as Trip Advisor, Orbitz, and Expedia, examines how the hotel management responds to these negative reviews. The negative comments, which comprise criticism, complaints, and unfavourable comments, can be understood as travellers' display of negative emotions due to unmet behavioural expectations (i.e., the expected kind of service defined by the contractual requirements between the hotel and its customers). To manage rapport with dissatisfied customers and to achieve service recovery, rapport management strategies are explored. In managing face sensitives, the manager shows gratitude to customers' negative comments to make customers feel they are respected and important. In attending to association rights, the manager expresses his feelings upon reading those negative comments, aiming to form an effective association. By giving customers options and minimizing the impositions upon them, customers' equity rights are attended to. In managing interactional goals, the manager reacts by acknowledging the problems mentioned by the customers, explaining the triggers of the problem, or describing actions taken to resolve the problems.

Ran and Zhao (2018) is another study that concerns the management of interlocutors' negative emotions resulting from unmet behavioural expectations. Utilizing data from interpersonal conflict mediation between acquaintances in the Chinese context, the researchers discuss how the unmet culturally-based expectations of qingmian evoke interpersonal conflicts and interlocutors' negative emotions (e.g., anger, disappointment). To resolve conflicts between the two conflicting parties and to attend to the offender's negative emotional reactions, a mutual affection-based face is built by the mediator. Qingmian practices such as soliciting the offender's request for mortification, showing deference, soliciting attentiveness, and soliciting reciprocity are enacted by the mediator to manage the unmet expectations of qingmian between two conflicting parties.

Since other studies that focus on rapport management strategies might shed light on negative emotion management caused by violations of behavioural expectations, this section will review rapport management strategies that are discussed in a range of interactional environments, involving both oral communication and written communication.

Rapport management strategies in mundane conversations. García (2009) examines how Peruvian Spanish speakers manage behavioural expectations, face wants, and interactional wants when congratulating others. In tending to co-interlocutors' association rights, interlocutors pay more attention to empathy than to involvement. Specifically, empathy is expressed through discursive moves of approving, congratulating, and expressing good wishes. Besides, interlocutors' identity face is enhanced through expressions of approval/acceptance, the expression of happiness, hinting at one's desire to be invited, and the use of grounders.

Cultural factors play a significant part in the management of rapport. Based on social talk collected from the task-orientated interactions of Japanese and Thai speakers, Aoki (2010) conducts a comparative study to explore how Japanese speakers and Thai speakers construct rapport in casual group talk. For Japanese participants, rapport is primarily reflected through communally shared topics, whereas rapport in the Thai group is reflected through attending to each member's self. Due to the 'loosely structured social system' in Thai culture, individual-based topics are a major concern, and Thai selves are promoted as the basis for constructing rapport with others. Linguistically, Thai people prefer to use intensifiers to display involvement and intimacy, and in this way to create a friendly atmosphere.

Rapport management strategies in institutional settings. Drawing data from business settings, Campbell et al. (2003) examine how managerial leaders improve their relationships with team members through communicative strategies such as the showing of interest in the co-participants' social roles, the use of in-group markers, and seeking agreements. Active listening, being intimate, giving deference, and minimizing imposition are linguistic tactics that are used to manage the recipients' sociality rights. Paramasivam (2011) examines the ways to manage the interpersonal relations between pilots and controllers in air traffic control in Malaysia. Rapport is found to be achieved via linguistic devices of justification, terms of address, conventionally politeness expressions (e.g., please), modals, and conditional language use. Drawing on institutional conversation, Pounds (2019) discusses how rapport is managed in police officers' interviews with suspects. Rapport is operationalized in two major aspects: empathy and face. Empathy is achieved by showing an understanding of the suspect's feelings and demonstrating positive regard. As for face, it is enhanced through the strategies of suggesting the innocence of the suspect, claiming reduced

responsibility, demonstrating active listening, expressing affiliation, using humour, etc. The analysis reveals that the rapport-orientated technique is more effective when eliciting information from suspects of terrorism.

Rapport management strategies in written communications. Hernández-López (2019) reports how the hosts manage their relationship with guests on the social platform of Airbnb. They attend to the guests' equity rights by giving them freedom and independence; attend to their association rights by investing time, effort, and affect; attend to their face needs through the speech acts of complimenting, praising, thanking, and recommending. Ho (2011) examines the ways to enhance the relationship between English teachers of public education when the relationship is challenged in request emails. In terms of the discourse domain, they attend to the relationship by blending institutional, professional, and personal discourses. Specific discursive moves, such as expressing feelings, ideas, emotions, and wishes, convincing the recipient, and showing gratitude for requesting help, are employed to enhance or maintain rapport. Inductive and deductive rhetorical approaches are also exploited by team members to manage the relationships.

Overall, prior research illuminates the exploration of negative emotion management, triggered by unmet behavioural expectations, to be discussed in this study. Linguistic practices of accounting, justifying, excusing, denying, and rationalizing can be used to restore face and heal discordant rapport, while linguistic devices such as complimenting, praising, thanking, displaying empathy, and giving approval/acceptance can enhance the relationship between interlocutors.

# 2.6 a Critique of Previous Studies

The reviews of the literature on emotions have been examined from a wide range of dimensions, including (non)linguistic expressions of emotions, classification of emotions, the triggers of negative emotions, and the practices/strategies that are used for managing negative emotions. These studies shed light on the research focus (i.e., the management of negative emotions) of this study at least in three aspects: (a) how to identify interlocutors' negative emotions in interaction; (b) the idea of negative emotions as social constructs whose interpretation needs to consider the social/moral ground in which the interaction takes place, as well as the social roles of interlocutors; and (c) interpersonal interactions as the major elicitors of negative emotions, and the role of rapport/relational management in emotion management as having been seldom discussed. Despite the achievements and the implications, the investigation into emotion and emotion management should be expanded and deepened due to the following limitations.

(1) Insufficient research into the influence of culturally specific principles on emotions. The role of social and cultural norms/principles in influencing people's perceptions of rapport and one's emotional reactions needs to be examined. It has been widely accepted that one's perception of rapport is largely dependent on interlocutors' evaluation of violations or adherence to the social norms/principles, and the perceived rapport is accompanied by one's emotional reactions. For instance, Locher and Watts (2008) argue that negative evaluation is a representation of negative emotion, being articulated when 'the level of relational work does not match their expectations' (p.79). Spencer-Oatey (2011) maintains that the infringements of personal expectations/social norms are always emotion-sensitive. These studies, which are mainly examined in Western academia, have the following limitations when applied to this study.

The relationship type between interlocutors tends to be less intimate (e.g., between service providers and service users), thus the social norms/principles that apply to those interactions might not be adequate when a close relationship is concerned. As far as the social relationship between interlocutors is concerned, Spencer-Oatey's (2002) study concerns Chinese students' (mostly recent arrivals in Britain) interactions with a wide range of people (e.g., school teachers, classmates, hostesses, employers, taxi drivers) and no further differentiation is done in terms of the relationship type between interlocutors. In another study conducted by Spencer-Oatey and her research partner (Spencer-Oatey & Xing 2003), the relationship type between the participants is that of business partners (i.e., Chinese delegation members and the staff of the British company).

With regard to the relationship type of the participants in this study, it focuses on people's interactions with those with whom they are close or have a long-term relationship. Under such circumstances, the relational principle that underpins their interaction should be different from the principles that underpin the interaction of more distant relationships, which requires further exploration and explanation.

Little research has examined the role of social norms/principles in influencing people's perceptions of rapport, in particular in the Chinese sociocultural context. One exception can be found in Ran and Zhao (2018). Utilizing Chinese data on interpersonal conflict mediation, the researchers report how the unmet qingmian expectations between acquaintances trigger interpersonal conflicts and negative emotions. It is based on this pragmatic principle of qingmian that people evaluate the appropriateness of acquaintances' behaviour.

The significance of broader socio-cultural expectations and the interpersonal histories between participants in influencing people's perceptions of rapport has been commonly acknowledged by scholars

(e.g., Chang & Haugh 2011; Arundale 2010; O'Driscoll 2007). All call for an investigation of the social expectations in specific relationship types, and how these expectations influence people's perceptions of rapport and their emotional reactions. This exploration is further demanded by the differences in advocated cultural values, i.e., between individualism and collectivism. For instance, an independent self emphasizes equity and liberty whereas an interdependent self (e.g., a Chinese self) values interdependence, mutuality, and reciprocity (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998: 8-19).

(2) Lack of empirical studies on the interplay between emotions and relationships. Prior research has documented a unilateral interplay between emotions and interpersonal relations. Many studies (e.g., Spencer-Oatey 2002, 2011; Kienpointer 2008; Isik-Güler & Ruhi 2010; Culpeper 2011; Ho 2017) have verified that people's perceptions of disharmonious relations/threatened rapport would evoke negative emotions. Namely, emotions have always been explored from an outcome-orientated approach and they are understood as responses to impulsiveness or relational disharmony. Very few studies have taken a process-orientated approach to examine how negative emotions occur due to disharmonious relations, and how they are managed through relationship management strategies. An exploration that approaches from this perspective would contribute to a more integrated understanding of, and make more easily observable, the interconnection between emotions and interpersonal relations.

(3) Inadequate pragmatic studies on emotion management. In the existing research, the linguistic studies on emotion management are mainly explored from a conversation analytic approach. Drawing on data from telephone helplines and emergency call lines (e.g., Bolden 2010; Shaw and Kitzinger 2013), CA-grounded investigation of emotion management finds that call-takers, when they found callers' outbursts of emotions would impede their collection of essential information, would actively manage their own or the callers' emotions by remaining calm, using directives (e.g., let's calm down) and reassuring the callers (e.g., the help is on the way). More CA-grounded studies examine emotion management by drawing data from psychotherapy and counselling. For instance, Weiste (2016) reports that therapists use two types of formulation sequences to manage clients' maladaptive emotional states, and Voutilainen et al. (2010) present how the practices of recognition and interpretation are used by therapists to respond to clients' negative emotions. In addition to these studies, Muntigl et al. (2017) examine the role of specific interactional structures in emotion management. This study shows how therapists guide clients to speak with conflicted aspects of themselves or with non-present significant

others to cope with unresolved feelings. During this interactional process, the management of participants' epistemic authority, as well as deontic authority, which accommodates the transition of four distinct interlocking interactional phrases, are discussed.

(4) Lack of research on norms of emotional expression in the Chinese social context. The field of emotions has come a very long way in the last 40 years, however, the norms of emotional expression in different sociocultural contexts is an area that needs to be further addressed. Except for a few works on Chinese which I have referred to above (e.g., Gong 2014), more research on the expression of emotions is examined in the Western sociocultural context. There is a need to explore how the high-context communication culture influences the emotional expression of Chinese people, including the ways negative emotions are displayed.

# 2.7 Conclusion

This chapter, building on the last, suggests that emotion management can be examined from an interpersonal pragmatics approach. A review of the literature finds that negative emotion is an interpersonal phenomenon. Interpersonal sensitive events, such as face threats, impulsiveness, and rapport threats are closely associated with people's emotional reactions. For instance, if people perceive their expectations that result from interactional principles are not met, people may perceive the damaged rapport between them and co-interlocutors, followed by emotional reactions such as anger/ sadness. An analysis of the sequential unfolding of emotions also supports this point.

In addition to interpreting emotions from an interpersonal pragmatics perspective, the fact that rapport can be dynamically managed in interaction is crucial for investigating emotions and emotion management from the interpersonal pragmatics approach. The rapport practices such as doing facework, and accounting for the unmet expectations in interpersonal communication would influence people's perceptions of rapport and bring changes to people's emotional status.

The limitation of research in emotion management is an important motivation for working towards an interpersonal pragmatics approach. The prior studies on emotion management mainly take a conversation analytic approach, focusing on the linguistic practices in which the interactants respond to the negative emotions and the sequential features. However, the triggers of negative emotions and their roles in emotion management have been greatly overlooked. This calls for discourse analysts to adopt an interpersonal pragmatics perspective to examine the triggers of negative

emotions and the practices to manage these triggers, to manage negative emotions in interaction.

Examining emotion management from an interpersonal pragmatics approach will also illuminate research on rapport, and in particular the interactional principles on which people's perceptions of rapport are based. Over the past 20 years, the equity principle and the association principle have long been discussed in the rapport literature. Despite its explanation power, these two principles are mainly rooted in Western culture. The culturally specific interactional principle that influences people's perceptions of rapport is worthy of investigation. Such an endeavour points to the universality and specifically of interactional principles in interpersonal communication across the world and across different cultures.

# 3 Arguing for a Ganqing Approach to Rapport (management)

# 3.1 Introduction

Following on from the interpersonal pragmatics approach, Chinese people's negative emotions in interaction are understood and managed, producing a culturally specific approach to rapport (management). This chapter proposes a ganqing approach to rapport management, providing new insights into the interactional principle/relational principle/pragmatic principle in Chinese interpersonal communication. I shall start by elaborating on four notions—ganqing, renqing, qingmian, and emotion. The definitional issues and their interplay will be discussed. I will then argue for why a ganqing approach to rapport management is needed, particularly the aspects that the fundamental interactional principles of the RMF cannot fully explain. Then, I describe the interplay between ganqing, rapport, and negative emotions, attempting to explain the rationale for managing negative emotions through rapport management. Finally, I elaborate on the concept of ganqing and connect it with the related concept of im/politeness in a much more explicit manner.

# 3.2 the Backdrop for a Ganqing Approach

What are the prior approaches to rapport (management)? Why is it necessary to put forth a new approach? These are the issues to be discussed.

# 3.2.1 Face Approach to Rapport (management)

According to Spencer-Oatey (2008), people's perceptions of rapport are influenced by three key factors: face sensitivities, behavioural expectations, and interactional goals. These three factors point to different approaches to rapport (management).

The face approach is one of the key approaches discussed in the literature (Spencer-Oatey 2000, 2005). If people want to have a harmonious and smooth relationship with others, they need to consider their interlocutors

and their face conditions. Conditions such as gaining face, keeping face, threatening face, and losing face, can affect people's judgement of rapport. That is, whether the rapport between them and interlocutors is enhanced, maintained, or damaged.

The 'face' concept is conceptualized and operationalized when we examine rapport (management) from a face approach. The types of face being discussed are summarized:

(1) Brown and Levinson's notion of face, which defines face as 'the public self-image that every member wants to claim for himself' and distinguishes between positive face and negative face. According to them, a positive face is a person's desire to be appreciated and approved by others, in terms of personality, behaviours, values and so on. Negative face concerns a person's desire to be unimpeded by others, and the desire not to be imposed upon them. Based on this interpretation of face, the researchers have examined the issues of rapport (management). For instance, a student's critical comments on the teacher challenge the teacher's sense of competence as a teacher, thus making the teacher lose face concerning the attribute of competence and threatening the rapport between them (Spencer-Oatey 2007). Schröder (2014) takes up the notion of 'face' established by Brown and Levinson (1987) to discuss the interplay of (im)politeness, conflict styles, and rapport management in Brazilian-German interaction.

(2) Spencer-Oatey's notion of face involves the respectability face and the identity face. The former refers to the prestige, honour or 'good name' that a person or social group holds and claims within a (broader) community. Unlike respectability face, which is pan-situational, identity face is situation-specific, reflects people's social values, and relates to specific social attributes. Researchers have adopted this approach to rapport management. For example, Harrington (2018) investigates how the collections agents at a UK-based utility company call centre attend to the debtors' identity face and convey other rapport-relevant information to maintain and enhance rapport with them.

In addition to respectability face and identity face, Spencer-Oatey (2008) proposes quality face and social identity face when discussing rapport-related topics. Quality face involves personal qualities, abilities, and competence, while social identity face is concerned with the roles a person plays in society. People have the desire to be thought of as close friends or important clients. This is closely associated with their self-images or face. Adopting this rapport approach, Sun and Chen (2023) explore how producers of public signs enhance rapport by promoting the target

audience's social identity face. Also, this study reports how the producer attends to the target audiences' quality face by indirectly projecting them as literally 'elegant', therefore enhancing rapport with them.

As discussed above, the rapport (management) researchers take face as a central concern when examining rapport management practices in interaction. Whatever the construct of face the analysis is rooted, it is widely accepted that face wants, face-threatening acts, face-enhancing acts, and other face-relevant issues provide a window through which people's rapport with interlocutors can be perceived and managed.

# 3.2.2 Equity and Association Rights Approach to Rapport (management)

Behavioural expectations based on interactional principles are key elements that influence people's perceptions of rapport. The equity principle and the association principle are two superordinate principles. Based on the interplay of the equity principle, association principle, and people's perceptions of rapport, an equity approach and association approach to rapport (management) can be generalized.

First, the equity approach explores how people are concerned about equity issues for interlocutors and how these issues influence people's dynamic judgement of rapport. These issues involve (a) cost-benefit considerations (the extent to which we are exploited or disadvantaged, and the belief that costs and benefits should be kept roughly in balance through the principle of reciprocity); and (b) autonomy-imposition considerations (the extent to which people control us or impose on us) (Spencer-Oatey 2008: 16). The research on rapport has been examined using this approach. For instance, Ho (2017) finds that the hotel manager demonstrated his/ her awareness of the reviewers' desire for 'personal consideration from others' (Spencer-Oatey 2008: 16) by minimizing the imposition on the reviewer—giving them options not to act as suggested. When taking an equity approach, the researchers also investigate the types of expectations that are formed based on the equity principle, and how breaches of expectations lead to disharmony (discordant rapport) between interlocutors (Spencer-Oatey 2002; Spencer-Oatey & Xing 2019).

Second, the association rights approach to rapport (management) examines the types of behavioural expectations based on the association principle and the practices that people attend to these expectations for managing the rapport between interlocutors. The behavioural expectations, which are formed based on the association principle, include (a) the expectation of interactional involvement; and (b) the expectation of affective involvement (Spencer-Oatey 2008: 16). In addition to the expectations, many studies examine the linguistic practices employed when attending to the association rights. For example, Harrington (2018) reports that the debt collector manages the relevant association rights by

encouraging interlocutors' involvement, sharing appropriate concerns, and showing respect. Sampietro (2019) finds that the Peninsular Spanish interlocutors use smiling emojis to display closeness and involvement.

# 3.2.3 Interactional Goal Approach to Rapport (management)

In the RMF, the interactional goal is a third factor that influences interactional rapport. When interacting with others, people may have interpersonal goals or task-focused goals, or both. These goals or wants can significantly influence people's perception of rapport since any failure can bring people annoyance and frustration. This points to an interactional goal approach to rapport (management). For instance, Ho (2017) investigates how the hotel management manages rapport with dissatisfied customers. The managers manage the reviewer's interactional goals by acknowledging the problem, explaining the cause of the problem, apologizing, or describing the action taken to rectify the problem. In Sun and Chen (2023), the analysis reveals that a directive public sign that prohibits smoking attends to interlocutors' interactional goals and enhances rapport by directing them as to where to smoke.

# 3.2.4 Qingmian and Renqing Approach to Rapport (management)

In addition to the three approaches discussed above, rapport (management) has been approached from culturally specific perspectives within pragmatics research. The qingmian-orientated relationship/rapport management proposed by Ran and Zhao (2018) is noteworthy. From an emic perspective, the culturally important notion of qingmian is key to understanding rapport management in Chinese. Qingmian refers to the 'emotional ties between at least two acquaintances based on long-term renqing and mianzi practices' (ibid: 185). The relationship between two parties can be damaged by qingmian threat, involving inattentive behaviour, failure to reciprocate renqing, and face-threatening behaviours. To manage the disharmony, interlocutors can request modifications, do deference, solicit attentiveness, solicit reciprocity, etc.

The qingmian-orientated relationship management also discusses the interrelationship between emotion and relational work. Qingmian threat is associated with disharmony and emotional reactions (the other condemning emotions and self-conscious emotions). Emotional reactions are important indicators of the quality of the status quo of the relationship between interlocutors. Therefore, this moral order has important theoretical implications for understanding the role of emotions in relationship/ rapport management.

In some studies, the influence of renqing on rapport (management) is discussed separately. The renqing principle is proposed as a pragmatic

principle that explains the emic features of rapport (management) in Chinese culture. The renqing approach to rapport has been employed to explain interpersonal relationships in daily life contexts. Ran and Zhao (2018) examine how an experienced folk mediator resolves interpersonal conflicts between relatives or neighbors by using the renqing principle. Renqing approach is not limited to daily interaction but can also be applied to the institutional context. For instance, Zhao and Ran (2022) discuss the influence of renqing on government-citizen interactions. Drawing on data from an e-government platform, they investigate how the Chinese local government enhances rapport with citizens to construct an image of 'displaying emotional concern'. Based on the analysis, a rapport management model for government-citizen interaction based on the renqing principle, reason, and law is proposed. In another study, Ran (2018) explores how Chinese renqing functions in managing rapport and its reciprocity.

# 3.2.5 Critical Overview of Prior Approaches to Rapport (management)

(1) Most of the existing research examines rapport (management) by applying Spencer-Oatey's RMF. However, as Spencer-Oatey has maintained earlier when examining rapport management issues, it is crucial to analyze the similarities and differences that occur across cultures, contexts, and individuals (Spencer-Oatey 2005: 117).

(2) From a culturally specific or emic perspective, the qingmian approach to rapport and the renqing approach to rapport have been proposed. Qingmian and renqing mainly exist among family relatives, friends, or neighbors. Accordingly, these two approaches mainly apply to the interpersonal interaction between the members of these particular social groups, neglecting the interaction in more intimate and closer relationships. For example, between the parent and the child, husband-wife in the family context. The interactional principle or pragmatic principle that underpins their interaction needs to be addressed. Also, we need more empirical evidence of rapport (management) in intimate and close relationships to see how the specific relational principle unfolds in the interaction.

# 3.3 on a Ganqing Approach to Rapport (management)

# 3.3.1 Definitional Issues

In this section, key notions and their interconnections will be delineated.

Ganqing vs. Emotion Emotion and ganqing (感情) are two distinct notions, varying in terms of conceptualization and content. It can be 'misleading to equate the western concept of "emotions" with qinggan or ganqing, as many Chinese beginners in English do' (Sun 1991: 10). Among

the many definitions made of ganqing (Yang 1994; Kipnis 1997; Chen & Chen 2004; Wang 2007, to name a few), this study adopts the viewpoint that ganqing is a relational principle or social norm that Chinese people should follow when they interact with specific guanxi members (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998; Ledeneva 2008; Zhu 2015; Chang 2018). As for emotions, they are 'socially and culturally shaped and malleable products' that emerge dynamically during the interaction (Langlotz & Locher 2013: 91).

Ganqing vs. Renqing The concepts of ganqing and renqing (人情) are used somewhat differently in Chinese interpersonal communication, though both serve as the relational principle or moral order that underpins Chinese people's interaction. (1) Ganqing is said to be the affective component of guanxi and focuses on emotional attachment and affection, while renqing represents the conative component of guanxi, emphasizing the reciprocal exchange of favours with empathy (Barnes et al. 2011; Yen et al. 2011). (2) Ganqing is found in long-term guanxi members (Yang 1994), such as parents and children, close friends (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998), co-workers (Jacobs 1979), and long-term business partners (e.g., Chen & Chen 2004; Wang 2007; Yen et al. 2017). With regards to renqing, it is more prevalent in relationship dyads such as those involving acquaintances and relatives (Zhao 2017; Ran 2018; Ran & Zhao 2018; Zhao & Ran 2019, 2022).

Ganqing vs. Qingmian Qingmian (情面) refers to 'the emotional ties between at least two acquaintances based on long-term renqing and mianzi practices' (Ran & Zhao 2018), unlike ganqing which emphasizes mutual affection and relational obligations. As far as the types of interpersonal relationships are concerned, ganqing mainly applies to the social interaction between intimate and long-term relationships, while qingmian is a moral expectancy underpinning the communication between family relatives, friends, or neighbours.

# 3.3.2 Ganqing as a Relational Principle

Definition of ganqing Ganqing (感情), an emic notion of emotivity in Chinese (Chang 2013: 43), has been conceptualized in various ways. It refers to the emotional commitment and social bonds in long-standing and intimate relationships (e.g., Yang 1994; Chen & Chen 2004), also a relational principle that Chinese people should follow in interpersonal communication (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998; Zhu 2015; Chang 2018), and a resource for social exchange (e.g., Yen et al. 2017). Ganqing is also an indicator of the closeness of guanxi or is equal to guanxi under some circumstances (Kipnis 1997; Wang 2007: 82).

The key points regarding the notion of ganqing can be summarized as follows: (a) the intimate social bonds/emotional attachment/affect that exist between direct family members, close friends, cooperative partners,

or other in-group members; (b) an important component/affective side/ emotional side of guanxi or a synonym of guanxi;(c) a moral order/social norm; and (d) a resource for social exchange or business purposes.

Major components of ganqing Ganqing has been widely accepted as a relational principle or social norm that underpins Chinese people's interpersonal communications (e.g., Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998; Ledeneva 2008; Zhu 2015; Chang 2018). When it is regarded as a relational principle, its major components involve:

(a) Feelings/emotional feelings/affectionate feelings. Ganqing means 'caring about someone's feelings' (Zhao & Pan 2019), 'emotional feelings' (Ledeneva 2008), and 'mutual good feelings' (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998; Santangelo 2005). Similarly, some scholars argue that ganqing stresses 'empathic understanding' (Yang 1994), 'emotional understanding' (Chen & Chen 2004), or mutual empathic understanding. To sum up, treating specific guanxi members with feelings or mutual good feelings is a key element in ganqing.

(b) Attachment/emotional attachment. Ganqing means a close relationship between specific guanxi members. Other notions such as 'emotional attachment' (e.g., Yang 1994; Wang 2007; Chang 2013, 2018; Yen et al. 2017), 'closeness' (Gao and Ting-Toomey 1998), 'connections' (Chen & Chen 2004), 'relational connections with others' (Hsiang 1974; Chang & Holt 1994), or 'inner attachment' (Guo 2001) are also used.

(c) Reciprocal obligations. According to the relational principle of gan- qing, one is obligated to reciprocate the other's favours, to 'live up to one's social obligations', 'help one another' (Yang 1994: 122), and to fulfil mutual obligations within a reciprocal relation (Chang & Holt 1994).

# 3.3.3 a Ganqing Approach to Rapport (management): a Theoretical Proposal

A ganqing approach attends to the relationship aspect of communication using the relational principle of ganqing. According to the ganqing principle, interlocutors have a fundamental belief that they are entitled to be treated with emotional/affectionate feelings by people from the intimate or close relationship, to have a close relationship with them, and have an obligation to reciprocate the favours they have received. The ganqing principle results in interlocutors' perceptions of role relationships, including rights and obligations associated with them.

When interlocutors have specific interactional wants and role obligations, they make dynamic judgements as to whether these wants are being achieved, the obligations are being fulfilled, and whether they are

being impeded. Accordingly, if they are paying attention to the quality of interpersonal relationships with the intimates, they make dynamic judgements as to whether they have been treated with affectionate feelings. Simultaneously, they have expectancy reactions to the verbal and non-verbal behaviour they experience and perceive it as positively eventful, negatively eventful, or simply ignore it. These judgements can often result in significant emotional reactions.

When these judgements are made, and as these emotional reactions occur, people will have to decide how they manage them verbally and nonverbally. The management process will be the central focus of this study.

# 3.3.4 Understanding Negative Emotions: an Application of a Ganqing Approach

In this section, the relationship between the ganqing principle, perceived sociality rights and obligations, rapport, and emotion will be discussed.

Drawing on the studies that concern how ganqing serves as a relational principle underpinning people's interaction with those close to them, and following Spencer-Oatey's research on the interplay between norms/principles, perceived sociality rights and obligations, perceived rapport, and people's emotional reactions, Figure 3.1 is drawn. Ganqing serves as a socio-pragmatic interactional principle that underpins Chinese people's interpersonal communication, just as the equity principle and association principle are two fundamental principles that underpin interaction (e.g., Spencer-Oatey 2000, 2008). According to the ganqing principle, a Chinese self is expected to be treated with good feelings by specific guanxi members and to have a close relationship with them. These two aspects are the perceived sociality rights (Spencer-Oatey 2008: 15-16) concerning the relational principle of ganqing. Furthermore, ganqing involves one's fulfilment of reciprocal obligations when interacting with these guanxi members.

Subsequently, if (1) a person perceives that his/her ganqing expectation is not met or (2) he/she perceives himself/herself as not fulfilling reciprocal obligations, this would negatively influence his/her perceptions of rapport and result in evaluations of ganqing violation-induced discordant rapport (hereafter GQVI discordant rapport), the latter of which can often result in one's negative emotional reactions (cf. Figure 3.1).

# 3.4 the Relationship of Ganqing to Im/politeness

Emotivity and im/politeness: Wenqing (温情, warmth), qingmian (情面, mutual affection-based face), renqing(人情, emotion), and empathy are key notions of emotivity. These notions have been discussed in several works on im/politeness. Kádár and Pan (2011) assert that showing wenqing is a demonstration of politeness in Chinese communication, while a lack of genuineness or 'insincerity' often presupposes the lack of politeness. Qingmian, which refers to the emotional ties between at least two acquaintances, is also closely associated with politeness. The violations of qingmian are related to impoliteness evaluations in the Chinese sociocultural context (Zhao & Ran 2019).

In addition to the three qing-related notions, empathy is also related to politeness. According to Larina and Ponton (2022: 201), 'politeness is not only social but is also a psychological phenomenon based on empathy, whose manifestations may vary across cultures'. In Japanese culture, empathy is considered an attitudinal stance encompassing concern for the feelings of others (Fukushima & Haugh 2014: 168).

Though the above notions concern the interrelationship between emotivity and im/politeness in one way or another, the type of interpersonal interaction that these notions apply is limited. For example, wenqing is believed to be very important in business interaction, given that emotive discourse, such as inserting lengthy 'warming-up' sections in professional lectures, is considered to promote long-term business relationships (Zhu 2015). Qingmian mainly lies in acquaintanceship relationships in the context of Chinese interpersonal communication, such as between family relatives, friends, or neighbours. As for renqing, it mainly exists in the interaction between 'relatives, neighbours, classmates, colleagues, teachers and students, people sharing a natal area, and so forth' (Hwang 1987: 952). Empathy is said to be important, especially in Japanese culture (Clancy 1986; Uchida 2011). Wierzbicka (1997: 275) regards it as one of the most important ideals in Japanese society. In Chinese society, title (体贴, attending to others' feelings) and thoughtfulness are roughly considered the equivalents of empathy (Chang 2018; Fukushima & Haugh 2014).

On ganqing and im/politeness Ganqing describes the emotivity that exists between intimate and long-term relationships. The pragmatic

principle/relational principle of ganqing is characterized by mutual good feeling/emotional understanding and emotional attachment. Also, ganqing emphasizes one's obligation to reciprocate the others' favours. When one communicates with a guanxi member (i.e., with whom one has an intimate or long-term relationship), it is heavily based on ganqing expectations that the Chinese self's behaviour or the guanxi member's behaviour is evaluated as 'polite', 'non-polite', or 'rude'. That is to say, ganqing concerns the conceptualizations of linguistic politeness and non-linguistic politeness in intimate and close relationships. Moreover, it describes the modern Chinese politeness phenomena, particularly the unfolding of politeness in interaction.

# 3.5 Conclusion

This chapter summarizes the existing approaches to rapport (management) and proposes a new approach. Ever since Spencer-Oatey's proposal for the notion of rapport and studying interpersonal interaction, how different interactional principles function in managing rapport and interpersonal relationships has been discussed. These point to different approaches to rapport (management). This chapter first explicitly claims there are six approaches to rapport (management): the face approach, equity approach, association rights approach, interactional goal approach, qingmian approach, and the renqing approach. The former four approaches are built on Spencer-Oatey's rapport management framework, which focuses on how face sensitivities, behavioural expectations based on the equity principle and association principle, and interactional goals, function in managing rapport and interpersonal relationships. The vast majority of studies have drawn on the four approaches to analyze interpersonal interaction, including both institutional and non-institutional interactions. However, further analysis reveals that these four approaches are more often used to study interpersonal relationships between non-intimate or more distant social members, leaving the rapport between the intimates under-examined.

Two Chinese scholars have discussed how the renqing principle and qingmian principle function in managing interpersonal relationships drawing on interactions in the Chinese sociocultural context. In their research, it is the relationship between neighbours, acquaintances, and family relatives that are discussed. What are the essential factors for constructing and managing interpersonal relationships between intimate social members such as parents and children, and husbands and wives? These are the questions to be explored.

In addition to discussing the necessity of investigating the rapport between the intimate ones and working towards a new approach to rapport (management), the theoretical foundation for proposing the new

approach is also introduced. Ganqing has long been studied in sociology, psychology, and communication studies in the Chinese literature. Ganqing is found to be an essential factor as well as a relational principle that influences Chinese people's interpersonal communication, in particular the communication between parents and children, husbands and wives, and close friends. Despite the importance of ganqing in Chinese interpersonal interaction, its linguistic manifestations, and how ganqing can be invoked in interaction, have been under-researched.

A ganqing approach to rapport (management) is therefore proposed, dedicated to accounting for the rapport and interpersonal relationships between intimate social members in Chinese society. Moreover, the newly proposed ganqing approach is drawn up in order to understand interlocutors' negative emotions in interpersonal psychotherapy sessions, given the interrelationship between interactional principle, rapport, and people's emotional status. By examining ganqing and proposing a ganqing approach to rapport(management), this study highlights the importance of ganqing in im/politeness research. It expands people's emic understanding of im/politeness and interpersonal interaction.

# 4 Description of Conceptual Framework

# 4.1 Introduction

This chapter establishes a theoretical framework to account for therapists' management of clients' negative emotions during Chinese psychotherapy sessions. It starts with an introduction of Spencer-Oatey's (2000) Rapport Management Theory (RMF), the aspects that the RMF can apply to the current data, and the limitations of RMF when applying to the dyadic therapist-client interaction. A surrogate-based RMF is then proposed. This chapter ends by introducing the rapport-orientated negative emotion management model.

# 4.2 Spencer-oatey's Rmf

The RMF provides a useful framework for understanding clients' negative emotions. In what follows, the aspects where rapport management succeeds in explaining and fails to explain are discussed. Such an endeavour aims to account for the necessity of incorporating the surrogate role into the process of rapport management and introducing the surrogate-based RMF.

# 4.2.1 Where Rmf Succeeds

Following the RMF, negative emotions provide a window for discerning what types of discordant rapport they appear as responses to, as well as the links between emotion categories and face, or perceived sociality rights and obligations.

The relationship between interlocutors needs to be considered if the rapport and interlocutors' emotional reactions are to be properly interpreted. According to Grossen and Orvig (2011: 54), psychotherapy sessions sometimes consist not only of actual participants but also of absent/ virtual participants who play a role in the dynamics of the conversation. In this study, the actual participants are therapists and clients, and the

absent participants are the persons who have close or long-term relationships with clients.

The rapport between therapists and clients is not the major concern (cf. Figure 4.1). The interpersonal relationships clients have with NPTPs, the relationship of which is disclosed in clients' self-reports is what the study aims to focus on. Given that it concerns the relationship between interlocutors, some aspects of the RMF still apply. For instance, clients' negative emotions can be understood as responses to the discordant rapport that exists between them and NPTPs, and the perceptions of discordant rapport can be a result of unmet behavioural expectations (or one's sociality rights have been infringed).

# 4.2.2 Where Rmf Fails

(1) Inadequate description of interlocutors' management of the relationship between co-interlocutors and NPTPs. Reviewing the literature, rapport management is often characterized as rapport management between direct interlocutors (cf. Table 4.1 for an overview), whether it discusses rapport management in face-to-face(F-t-F) communication or in computer-medicated communication (CMC).

The rapport management in these studies has been mainly concerned with how an interlocutor manages the rapport he/she has with other interlocutors directly. Given the unique participation structure of dyadic therapist-client interaction (cf. Figure 4.1), the rapport management involved in the process of negative emotion management is not direct rapport management

between one interlocutor and a co-interlocutor, it concentrates on how an interlocutor (A) manages the rapport a co-interlocutor (B) has with a NPTP. How do we understand A's participation role in the dynamics of rapport management? How does A manage the rapport between B and the NPTP (i.e., what types of rapport management strategies are employed)? These questions have not been fully addressed in the literature on rapport management.

(2) Fundamental interactional principles in RMF may not fully explain the cultural-specific phenomenon. According to the RMF, rapport is influenced by the perceived sociality rights and obligations, the latter of which is largely based on two fundamental socio-pragmatic interactional principles, i.e., equity and association. The equity principle stresses the components of cost-benefit and autonomy-imposition, while the association principle values the components of interactional involvement-detachment and affective involvement-detachment. This study not only concerns an equal relationship (i.e., clients' interaction with their couple, and with the close friends) but also a hierarchical one (i.e., the clients' interaction with their parents). The interpersonal relationship and communication, being influenced by Confucianism, emphasizes the relational obligations to whom we are close (i.e., filial obligations and reciprocating the favours), which cannot be fully and adequately reflected in the equity principle and the association principle. Therefore, empirical investigations are needed to examine more concrete 'cultural values' that underpin the interaction in the specific types of interpersonal relationships and to explore how they influence Chinese people's perceptions of rapport (Spencer-Oatey 2007: 90).

(3) The inadequacies of rapport orientations. Since clients' negative emotions are caused by discordant rapport with whom they are close or have long-term relationships, rapport-oriented management involves the management of disharmonious relationships and the rapport orientations therapists hold during this process. Before discussing whether the rapport orientations mentioned in the RMF apply to the current data, their contents are first introduced. The four rapport orientations (Spencer-Oatey 2000: 29-30; Spencer-Oatey & Franklin 2009: 117-118) proposed in the RMF involve:

(a) Rapport enhancement orientation: a desire to strengthen or enhance harmonious relations between the interlocutors;

(b) Rapport maintenance orientation: a desire to maintain or protect harmonious relations between the interlocutors;

(c) Rapport neglect orientation: a lack of concern or interest in the quality of relations between the interlocutors;

(d) Rapport challenge orientation: a desire to challenge or impair harmonious relations between the interlocutors (emphasis added).

The rapport orientation cannot be directly applied to this study given there is no harmonious relationship to start with. Lauriks et al.'s (2015) proposal of 'discordant rapport' sheds light on the resolution of this problem. Drawing on data from small business interactions, Lauriks et al. claim that not only the harmonious relationships be maintained, challenged, or enhanced, but the 'discordant rapport' (i.e., the disharmonious relations) can also be managed. They propose that people may deliberately maintain or promote discordant social relations when it is beneficial for them to do so. Their study sheds light on discordant rapport orientations, as well as the rapport management strategies that people employ if they hold different discordant rapport orientations. The under-researched areas concerning discordant rapport and discordant rapport orientations merit further scholarly attention.

# 4.3 the Framework: Rapport-orientated Management of Negative Emotions

# 4.3.1 Two Preliminaries

(1) Surrogacy in interaction

The notion of surrogacy is traced back to Mazer et al. (2014) research on doctor-patient-companion interaction. When a patient cannot make medical decisions (e.g., coma, dementia), a companion's 'speaking as' the patient is referred to as 'surrogacy'. The notion of 'pseudo surrogacy' describes another interactional phenomenon: the companion speaks for the patient as if the patient were not in the room or unable to speak for him/herself.

The interactional phenomenon that one speaks as the other or describes the other's beliefs has been widely discussed. Beisecker (1989) finds that in the process of consultation, a patient's companion often answers questions from the doctor on behalf of the patient. For example, if an elderly male patient has hearing difficulty or other language disorders, his family members may communicate with the doctor on behalf of him. Coupland and Coupland (2001) examine how the son of an elderly woman expresses his mother's experiences and worries, and obtains the relevant information from the doctor. Drawing data from a Korean livestream of cat mukbang, Choe (2020) analyzes how the chat message participants speak as/for the cat and animate its voice. The participant's animation of the cat's voice is

accompanied prosodically—the tone of voice, amplitude, lexical emphasis, rhythm, and intonational contours.

The interactional phenomenon of surrogacy corresponds with Goffman's (1981) production format theory. According to Goffman (1981), the discourse roles an interlocutor undertakes involve (a) an animator who is responsible for producing the sound; (b) an author who constructs words uttered or written by the animator; (c) a principal whose belief is represented and who is committed to what the words say, and (d) a figure who is being referred to by others. Then, why does an interlocutor animate co-interlocutors' voices? To help the co-interlocutor deal with the communicative difficulties is one motivation (e.g., the patient who has aphasia may not have the ability to express himself/herself). Tannen (2004) discusses how and why people animate the voice of another in everyday family interaction. The family members speak as and to their family dogs to achieve different communicative goals: resolving a conflict, lightening the atmosphere, or teaching a misbehaving child.

This study concerns another communicative context in which the animation occurs, but also to resolve the conflict. The types of conflict involved, and the interactional background for the conflict will be introduced.

# (2) Two-layered Interaction

Several authors have discussed the layers of communication or the levels of communication (or communicative levels). For instance, in the fictional discourse of films and plays (Short 1981, 1994; Bubel 2008; Dynel 2011), the first level of communication is realized by an 'unknowing' character oblivious to the viewers. The second layer of communication refers to the interactions that are followed by the viewers whose inferential processes are guided by the production crew. Dynel (2014) examines the participation framework and the communicative levels in the (non)fictional multi-party media talk. Three levels of communication are identified: the first level of communication on YouTube is realized by the speaker and hearers in the videos, the second level of communication concerns YouTube viewers and their interpretation of YouTube video discourse, while the third level of communication is realized by the comments between YouTube speakers and hearers.

The interpersonal psychotherapy session involves two layers of interaction. The first layer goes to the social interaction between the interpersonal psychotherapist and clients, and the second concerns the interaction between clients and NPTPs. The second layer of social interaction can be embedded in the first layer of interaction (Dynel 2014).

The above discussions are the preliminaries of surrogate-based rapport management. Chapters 6 and 7 will lay out how interpersonal psychotherapists animate in different ways and speak for/as different people (e.g.,

clients, NTPPs), to manage interpersonal conflicts that exist between clients and NTPPs.

# 4.3.2 Surrogate-based Rmf

To remedy the first limitation of the RMF when applying to the psychotherapeutic interaction, surrogate-based RMF is proposed (cf. Figure 4.2). The two sub-models of rapport management in the surrogate-based RMF are: (1) In the first sub-model (cf. the right, upper part of Figure 4.2), therapists act as the surrogates of clients, and they two form coalitions (Coe & Prendergast 1985) or confederations (Coupland & Coupland 2001). As a result, the interaction, which involves two participants present and an absent third party, evolves into the interaction between clients and the NPTP. (2) With regards to the second sub-model (cf. the right, lower part of Figure 4.2), therapists serve as the surrogates of NPTPs, and the two parties two form coalitions. Accordingly, the psychotherapeutic interaction turns into the interaction between clients and NPTPs.

In sum, the disharmony between clients and NPTPs can be managed by bringing the surrogate role of the therapists. By switching from one discourse role (e.g., surrogating clients) to another (e.g., surrogating NPTPs) and different types of rapport management strategies, therapists manage the relational disharmony between clients and NPTPs.

When applying the surrogated-based RMF to this study, two aspects worth noting. (1) The bases of rapport should be specified under the principles of ganqing. To start with, this study particularly focuses on how the discordant rapport between clients and NPTPs is threatened by the 'rights-threatening behaviours' and the 'obligation-omission behaviours' (Spencer-Oatey 2000: 17). Which means, the other bases (face sensitivities, and interactional goals) that influence people's perceptions of rapport) are not taken into consideration in the analysis of the rapport threats.

Concerning the close relationship between clients and NPTPs in Chinese interpersonal relationships and communication, the relational principle of ganqing is foregrounded as the socio-pragmatic interactional principle that underpins their interaction. According to the ganqing principle, the sociality rights involve two components, i.e., feelings and emotional attachment; while the sociality obligations are specified as reciprocal obligations. Accordingly, rapport threats such as lack of emotional feelings, emotional detachment, and non-fulfilling of reciprocal obligations would negatively influence people's perceptions of rapport and result in their negative emotions.

The second aspect worth mentioning is that discordant rapport orientations that involved in this study. Given rapport orientation in the RMF concerns the harmonious relations between interlocutors and there are also the disharmonious relations to deal with under some circumstances, together with the claim that 'one can promote, maintain, or threaten both harmonious or discordant relationships' (Lauriks et al. 2015), this study proposes that the speakers can hold any of the following four types of discordant rapport orientation when it is in their best interest to do so:

(a) Discordant rapport enhancement orientation: a desire to enhance the disharmonious relations between the interlocutors;

(b) Discordant rapport maintenance orientation: a desire to maintain the current quality of the relationship and level of disharmony between the interlocutors;

(c) Discordant rapport neglect orientation: a lack of concern or interest in the disharmonious relations between the interlocutors (perhaps because of a focus on self's face, sociality rights);

(d) Discordant rapport challenge orientation: a desire to challenge or impair the disharmonious relations between the interlocutors (so 'the relationship becomes more harmonious', Lauriks et al. 2015: 26).

The discordant rapport orientations mentioned above can be integrated into the rapport orientations proposed by Spencer-Oatey (2000: 31-33), making it a comprehensive framework for the analysis of people's orientations when they are managing relations by employing different types of rapport management strategies.

# 4.3.3 a Model of Rapport-orientated Management of Negative Emotions

# (1) Theoretical Foundations

Before presenting the rapport-oriented negative emotion management model, the interrelationship between perceptions of rapport and negative emotions is highlighted. According to Spencer-Oatey (2000), during an interaction, people make dynamic judgments as to whether the rapport between themselves and another interlocutor has been enhanced, challenged, or maintained. These judgments are based on the following three bases: perceived sociality rights and obligations, face sensitivities, and interactional goals. According to the RMF, the NPTPs' rights-threatening behaviours and clients' obligation-omission behaviour, pose a threat to rapport. Accordingly, threats to rapport tend to lead to the creation of negative emotional reactions. Having identified the reasons for clients' negative emotions, therapists then need to intervene to effectively manage clients' perception of rapport (e.g., to justify NPTPs' rights-threatening acts). In so doing, therapists attempt to modify clients' perceptions of the rapport they share with NPTPs. Based on the above discussion, Figure 4.3 presents the dynamics of relational (dis)harmony and the resulting emotional reactions of interlocutors.

As shown in Figure 4.3, if one of the two parties does not obey the basis of rapport, the result is an evaluation of disharmony, accompanied by negative emotions. However, if both parties obey the basis of rapport, the result is an evaluation of harmonious relations, which is associated with the normal status of emotions. Moreover, disharmony and the interlocutor's negative emotional reactions motivate rapport management efforts,

which can result in positive changes to the emotional status of the interlocutor. After the discussion on the interrelationship between harmony and disharmony, a rapport-orientated negative emotion management model is proposed in the penultimate part of this chapter.

(2) Dynamics of disharmony-harmony and interlocutor's emotional reactions

The motivation for rapport management: Threats to rapport, as perceived by clients, is characterized as follows. First, they are reflected in the meta-pragmatic comments made by clients about any prior social interactions they have with NPTPs. Second, this study focuses on how the perceived rapport between clients and NPTPs is threatened by 'rights-threatening behaviour' and 'obligation-omission behaviour' as defined by the relational principle of ganqing. Third, perceived rapport threats are accompanied by clients' negative emotions, which include both 'other-condemning emotions', 'self-conscious emotions', and the emotions triggered by these emotions (i.e., sadness). When therapists are confronted with clients' negative emotions, surrogate-based rapport management strategies are adopted by therapists to manage rapport threats (cf. Figure 4.4).

Means of management—surrogate-based rapport management: When the discordant rapport between clients and NPTPs is discerned and it is how clients' negative emotions are accounted for, therapists should take some actions to manage the discordant rapport. The strategies used by therapists are largely dependent on the discordant rapport orientations they take during this process. For instance, if therapists aim to repair the relational disharmony between clients and NPTPs, they can serve as NPTPs' surrogates and speak for them. Concerning the specific linguistic strategies that are used to manage rapport, excuses, and justifications are frequently employed.

Figure 4.5 A model of rapport-orientated management of negative emotions.

Contextual factors influencing rapport-orientated management: The social distance between clients and NPTPs, whether it is featured as a higher degree of intimacy or a lower degree of intimacy, is a key factor that influences therapists' choice of different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies when managing negative emotions. Based on the three aspects discussed above, a model of rapport-orientated management of negative emotions is proposed (Figure 4.5).

# 4.4 Conclusion

This chapter establishes an analytical framework to analyze the management of negative emotions from the interpersonal pragmatics approach. The interrelationship between people's perception of rapport and their emotional reactions is crucial for the construct of the conceptual framework. According to Spencer-Oatey's (2000) Rapport Management Theory, a perception of a harmonious relationship is associated with positive emotional reactions, while a perception of disharmony is followed by negative emotions. Another important aspect of working towards an interpersonal pragmatics approach to negative emotion management lies in the fact that people's perception of rapport is discursively constructed in interaction. If rapport management practices are adopted, the damaged rapport between the two parties can be managed. Accordingly, negative emotions accompanying the damaged rapport can be managed.

A close look at the causes of negative emotions and their management in Chinese interpersonal psychotherapeutic interaction will find that we cannot solely rely on Spencer-Oatey's RMF to work out the analytical framework. One problem lies in the fact that Spencer-Oatey's theory is more applicable to the social interaction between more distant social members. For instance, the interaction between the host and the guest tends to emphasize equity rights and association rights, as well as the interactional goals. However, these aspects are not necessarily important in the interpersonal communication between Chinese parents and their children. Therefore, when analyzing the interpersonal relationship between parents and children/husbands and wives/close friends in the Chinese sociocultural context, the interactional principle/relational principle of ganqing that guides the interaction between the Chinese intimates should be drawn on.

Another aspect well worth highlighting is that Spencer-Oatey's framework mainly explains the interaction between direct interlocutors. In interpersonal psychotherapy sessions, therapists manage clients' negative emotions. However, it is not the disharmonious relationship between therapists and clients that has caused clients' negative emotions. These negative emotions emerge when clients disclose the damaged rapport between them and people from intimate relationships. To manage these negative emotions, therapists either surrogate clients or clients' parents/couples/ close friends, taking rapport practices on their behalf to manage the disharmony. This interactional phenomenon involves the surrogate role in rapport management.

By incorporating the ganqing principle and bringing into the surrogate role to Spencer-Oatey's RMF, a surrogate-based RMF is proposed to analyze emotion management in interpersonal psychotherapy sessions. This framework guides the analyses in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, which concerns the triggers of negative emotions, and the rapport-orientated practices for managing the negative emotions.

# 5 Data and Methods

# 5.1 Introduction

The key issues I will address in this chapter are data and methodological issues that would make a detailed analysis of emotion management possible. Since it is impossible to make sense of the linguistic material without taking a step back to get a broader view of who our subjects are and why emotion management is relevant, this chapter attempts to do so by placing the discussion of negative emotion management and the interlinks between emotion management and rapport management into the context of interpersonal psychotherapy. In Section 5.3, I will describe the selection, processing, and analysis of the data. After describing the coding schemes in Section 5.4, I move on to the interactional approach on which the analysis is drawn. After that, dimensions for observing the effect of emotion management are described.

# 5.2 the Communicative Context: Interpersonal Psychotherapy Sessions

The psychotherapeutic approach the data represents is interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), an evidence-based therapy grounded in attachment theory and interpersonal theory (e.g., Klerman et al. 1984; Weissman et al. 2018). IPT is recommended for the treatment of depression in the American Psychiatric Association Guidelines for Primary Care Physicians (Karasu et al. 1993). According to IPT, the causes of the symptoms of depression might vary. Whatever the causes, however, they are usually associated with something going on in clients' personal lives, usually with those whom clients feel close to and who are important to clients. IPT 'focuses specifically on interpersonal relationships as a means of bringing about interpersonal change and symptomatic recovery, intending to help clients to improve their interpersonal relationships' (Stuart & Robertson 2015: 3). The process of change in IPT is presumed to be interactive: the process of (depression) symptom resolution is facilitated by the process

in interpersonal resolution. This means that if the interpersonal disputes between clients and their partners start to resolve, clients will feel less depressed and if clients feel less depressed, they will be able to resolve the dispute more efficiently (Law 2011). IPT involves three phases (ibid: 25-28; Stuart & Robertson 2015: 179-223).

(1) The initial phase. This stage concerns therapists' close examination of clients' current depressive symptoms and relevant history. Clients' close relationships, patterns, and mutual expectations are reviewed in this phase. This review provides a framework for understanding the interpersonal context of clients' depressive symptoms and defining the focus of the treatment. Therapists can link clients' depressive symptoms to clients' interpersonal situations within the framework of one of the four interpersonal problem areas: (a) grief (due to the death of a loved one); (b) interpersonal role disputes (i.e., conflicts with a significant other); (c) role-transitions (e.g., to a new job); and (d) interpersonal deficits (e.g., problems in sustaining or initiating relationships). In this study, both types (b) and (d) are involved.

(2) The middle phase. This is a stage during which therapists work towards improved communication and recognition, and expression of associated affect. Taking the area of interpersonal role disputes as an example, if clients' conflicts with their significant others are involved, therapists tend to help clients explore the relationship and the nature of the dispute and options to resolve it.

(3) Ending phase. It involves the review and evaluation of treatment, and support for continued use of interpersonal strategies, particularly when they are faced with potential symptomatic relapses.

The extracts presented in Chapter 6 mainly concern the interactions that occur in the initial phase of interpersonal psychotherapy, and the extracts laid out in Chapter 7 mainly concern the interactions that occur in the middle phase of interpersonal psychotherapy. The initial phase and the middle phase sometimes are recurring processes between therapists and clients (Bercelli et al. 2013).

# 5.3 Data Issues

Naturally occurring data, which is strong in validity, provides the researchers with the opportunity to explore interaction in 'natural contexts where participants present their intentions with real-world consequences' (Felix-Brasdefer 2007: 181). This study is based on this type of authentic data, and contributes to language use in institutional settings, with language usage in health settings. In what follows,

information about data collection, data selection, and data transcription is presented.

(1) Data collection. Two types of data were collected and two data sets were involved. The first data set consisted of audio recordings of naturally occurring psychotherapeutic interactions between therapists and clients from the outpatients of a Chinese hospital. Altogether 86 psychotherapy sessions were audio-recorded, with each session ranging in length from around fifty to sixty minutes. The amount of audio data recorded overall was approximately 80 hours. The recordings were gathered in the hospital between April 2017 and May 2020. The analyst was not present in any of the psychotherapy sessions; the data collection was done by therapists who audio-recorded the psychotherapeutic discourse they had with clients.

The second data set includes several post-recording interviews that were conducted with therapists by the analyst. This type of data was collected to elicit the participants' understanding of the causes of clients' negative emotions, as well as the effect of an intervention on negative emotions. Such efforts were intended to investigate interlocutors' interpretations of the actions and meanings during the psychotherapeutic interaction and thus provide additional evidence for the analysis of the social-interactional elicitors of clients' negative emotions by the analyst. These interviews were conducted when the first type of data was processed. During the interviews, therapists were asked to make comments when the analyst played back a target episode (clients' negative emotions displayed when they disclose the prior social interactions between them and the guanxi members) intending to elicit interlocutors' understanding of the interaction. Therapists tend to understand the episodes from a psychological perspective; only the episodes that were relevant to the theme of the study (interpersonal interaction, negative emotions, emotion management) were analyzed.

The consent for the recording and using data for academic purposes was gathered before the recordings of therapist-client interaction and the post-recording interview. The data collected remained anonymous; any information that could reveal a participant's identity or personal details was anonymized. Table 5.1 summarizes the data gathered and employed.

(2) Data selection. Since the reasons for people's visiting therapists vary from one to another, only the recordings that simultaneously satisfy the following three criteria are selected: (a) that the clients are suffering from depressed feelings at the time of data collection, usually ranging from a mild degree to a moderate degree; (b) that the clients' negative emotions are dynamically constructed, observable during the

psychotherapy session; (c) that clients' negative emotions are displayed when they are self-disclosing prior interpersonal interactions with the guanxi members.

In total, the 30 most representative negative emotion management episodes were extracted from 86 separate psychotherapy sessions, with 15 sessions involving clients' interaction with the non-present third parties (NPTPs) with whom they have a higher degree of intimacy (i.e., clients' parents or spouses) and 15 sessions involving clients' interaction with NPTPs with whom they had a lower degree of intimacy (clients' close friends or long-term collaborative partners). Each unit of psychotherapeutic discourse featured one client and one therapist. A total of two therapists and twenty-two clients were involved in this study.

(3) Data transcription. In the first step, the audio recordings were roughly transcribed that follow CA standards (Jefferson 2004), and the emotional signalling and their causes were identified. Based on these, single episodes were selected for more detailed transcription. The transcripts depict both the unfolding of negative emotions and the rapport-sensitive incidents reported during this process. When transcribing the data, contextual information, such as clients' social role, and the relational history between clients and the guanxi members, were noted for further examination.

# 5.4 Methodological Issues

In this part, the coding schemes, the analytical method, and the dimensions for observing the effect of psychotherapeutic intervention on negative emotions are introduced.

# 5.4.1 the Coding Schemes

The ways for identifying different types of negative emotions will first be presented, followed by the ways for identifying the types of ganqing violation-induced discordant rapport (hereafter GQVI discordant rapport) that exist between clients and NPTPs. Then, the linguistic devices for indicating 'surrogacy' and 'pseudo-surrogacy', and the linguistic realizations of different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies, will be illustrated.

(1) Coding of negative emotions. Since emotions can be responses to perceptions of discordant rapport (Spencer-Oatey 2005; Isik-Guler & Ruhi 2010), locating these emotions in the interactional sequences would reveal to what antecedent events they are responding and

discover the bases of discordant rapport (e.g., the types of rapport threats, or the types of sociality rights that have been infringed).

The negative emotions (anger, guilt, and sadness) are manifested through emotion words, or in a composite way. With regards to the 'composite emotional signal' (Clark 1996; Langlotz & Locher 2013: 101), it means to signal one's emotional status by describing it with emotional words, and at the same time indicating it with vocal cues. Table 5.2 below presents the emotional signalling of three types of negative emotions.

(2) Coding of GQVI discordant rapport. This part discusses the identification of the triggers of negative emotions (i.e., the types of GQVI discordant rapport). Disharmonious relationships between two interlocutors could be caused by unmet qing expectations (Ran & Zhao 2018; Ran 2018; Zhao & Ran 2019). In other words, one party performs an act that hurts the other party's feelings (renqing) (Zhao 2017). According to the related notions of ganqing (Yang 1994; Chang & Holt 1994; Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998; Chang 2013, 2018; Zhu 2015; Ledeneva 2008), also the bases of rapport (Spencer-Oatey 2000, 2008), the notions of discordant rapport (Spencer-Oatey 2005; Spencer-Oatey & Franklin 2009: 102; Lauriks et al. 2015), GQVI discordant rapport involves the following two sub-categories: (a) unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport: Emotional detachment and being

treated without feelings are rapport threats; and (b) unfulfilled ganning obligation-induced discordant rapport. Filial obligation omission behaviour and failure to repay the other's emotional debt are the rapport threats.

The rapport threats that lead to the GQVI discordant rapport and clients' negative emotions can be reflected in the linguistic and non-linguistic cues—clients' complaints, and therapists' meta-pragmatic comments on these complaints. Table 5.3 shows the ways to identify GQVI discordant rapport.

Coding of surrogate-based rapport management strategies. An examination of the data reveals that therapists are conscious and deliberate when they respond to clients' negative emotions caused by GQVI discordant rapport, which also can be verified from the dynamic discourse roles therapists take during psychotherapy sessions. When managing the GQVI, therapists take two kinds of discourse roles: (a) surrogating NPTPs, speaking on behalf of them, or speaking for them; or (b) surrogating clients (which is featured as pseudo-surrogacy). According to the prior studies, the linguistic devices for indicating surrogacy can be summarized as follows (cf. Table 5.4).

Surrogate-based rapport management concerns how therapists animate the voice of the people they surrogate (either clients or NPTPs) to manage the disharmony between clients and NPTPs. Based on prior research on rapport management between direct interlocutors, the surrogate-based rapport management strategies deployed by therapists are coded and categorized.

# 5.4.2 Examining Data from an Interactional Approach

An interactional approach, which is informed by findings and methods in CA (conversation analysis) (Arundale 2005: 56-69; Schegloff 2005: 474-475; Arundale 2010: 2094), concentrates on 'participants' interpretations and evaluations of persons and relationships in locally-situated discourse' (Haugh et al. 2015: 77). When taking such a discursive approach, the focus of analysis is not only placed on the actions but also the interpersonal stances and interpersonal evaluations in situated interactions (Arundale

2010: 2079, 2095). In Kádár and Mills (2011: 7-8), the features of an interactional approach are summarized as follows:

(1) It is discourse-based, as is reflected in the analysis of 'longer fragments of authentic interactions' and 'on the contextual variation of interpretation'. (2) Dual-focus of the utterances, which involves the speaker's production of utterances as well as the hearer's evaluation of them. (3) It is suitable to examine a range of relational phenomena, such as politeness and impoliteness. An interactional approach shares similarities with CA but differs somewhat from it. On the one hand, the interactional approach depicts how the participant understands and orients to the interactional practices, just as with CA traditions (e.g., Sacks 1992; Peräkylä et al. 2008). On the other hand, the interactional approach offers more 'theoretically motivated formulations of meanings, actions, and attitudes towards/evaluations of persons and relationships' (Haugh et al. 2015: 78).

The interactional approach facilitates the exploration of negative emotion management in the following aspects: the first aspect concerns how these negative emotions arise from and to what events they respond to. Drawing on the sequentiality of social action, the trigger for clients' negative emotions can be identified. By locating the presence of clients' negative

emotions in their self-reports about the interpersonal issues in the interactional sequences in which they occur, the close link between negative emotional reactions and the interpersonal issues (e.g., the types of rapport threats) can be identified (Işik-Güler & Ruhi 2010). The second aspect of the interactional approach facilitates the exploration of negative emotions management lies in the identification of the causes of negative emotions. Such identification is based on: (1) the types of discordant rapport that are disclosed in clients' self-reports; and (2) the 'sequential organization' of talk (Schegloff 1972; Levinson 2006), i.e., how therapists understand the preceding utterances. The ways through which therapists show their acceptance of clients' utterances are summarized in Table 5.6.

# 5.4.3 Effects of Surrogate-based Rapport Management and Negative Emotions

Given that emotions are 'socially regulated phenomena' (Fiehler 2002: 79) and are 'communicative observables' (Langlotz & Locher 2017: 288) which could be approached from a process-orientated perspective, the effect of therapists' intervention (i.e., surrogate-based rapport management) on clients' negative emotions can be observed. Importantly, emotion management involves both reducing/subduing or enhancing the experienced emotion (Thompson 1994: 29; Southam-Gerow & Kendall 2002). The dimensions and cues for observing changes in one's experienced emotions are listed in Figure 5.1.

In summary, drawing on the interactional approach, the effect of the management of clients' negative emotions is observable from the next turns. Different aspects of talk (e.g., sequential organization, turn construction, lexical choices, phonetic details) can be scrutinized to understand the interlocutors' emotionality (Local & Walker 2008).

# 5.5 Conclusion

The chapter familiarizes the readers with the data and sheds light on the research method of the study. By operationalizing some of the theoretical concepts introduced in the previous chapters, it steps up to the analysis in the next part of the book.

The interpersonal psychotherapy sessions provide us with an ideal communicative environment in which emotion management can be explored, in particular from an interpersonal pragmatics approach. Dealing with clients' negative emotions is a key issue of therapy talk, while the ways the negative emotions are managed are closely related to the therapeutic school the therapists adopt. The existing literature mainly takes a conversation analytic approach to examine the practices employed to manage clients' negative emotions in therapeutic contexts such as cognitive-constructivist therapy sessions, and emotion-focused therapy. Seldom do the studies consider the causes of negative emotions while examining emotion management. While interpersonal psychotherapists believe that interpersonal disputes trigger clients' depressed feelings or negative emotions, and interpersonal change brings positive changes to clients' emotional status. Such a therapeutic protocol resonates with the interpersonal pragmatists' understanding of negative emotions and facilitates an investigation into the interrelationship between interpersonal disharmony and negative emotions.

The dataset is composed of two parts: 86 therapy sessions between the interpersonal psychotherapists and clients, and 32 talks between therapists and the researcher.

While transcribing the data, the episodes that involve clients' disclosure of the disharmonious relationship between them and their intimates and the display of negative emotions are repeatedly listened to and carefully examined. Relying on the existing literature on negative emotions, disharmony, ganqing, and surrogacy, I have developed a catalogue of positioning the types of negative emotions, the types of disharmonies that trigger negative emotions, and the rapport practices employed to manage the negative emotions based on the data itself.

This study takes an interactional approach to examine the data. Such an approach absorbs the advantages of the conversation analytic method and presents the readers with the sequential features of the long fragments of authentic interactions. Moreover, it pays attention to the interpretation of relational meanings and relationships. Such a research method facilitates the exploration of negative emotions and its management. For instance, from the interactional sequences in which negative emotions occur, their triggers can be identified. Also, an interpersonal pragmatics motivated interpretation of negative emotions reveals that these emotions are evoked by disharmonious relationships. The types of relationships and the interactional principle guiding interpersonal interaction are further activated to understand the triggers of emotions. Also activated is the rapport management framework which explains therapists' response to clients' negative emotions.

# 6 Types of Negative Emotions

# 6.1 Introduction

This chapter reports on the types of negative emotions that clients display when they disclose the ganqing violation-induced discordant rapport (hereafter GQVI discordant rapport) that exists between them and NPTPs during psychotherapy sessions. In 6.2, I outline the types of negative emotions triggered by clients' unmet ganqing expectations. In 6.3, I present the types of negative emotions evoked by clients' unfulfilled ganqing obligations. The unmet expectations and unfulfilled obligations point to two different types of discordant rapport between clients and the NPTPs. Accordingly, the interlink between the types of discordant rapport and the types of negative emotions is discussed.

# 6.2 Anger/anger and Sadness

People's perceptions of disharmonious relations or discordant rapport result in negative emotions. When people find their behavioural expectations are not met, they would react with (1) anger or (2) anger and sadness. The following examples focus on clients' self-reports of the unmet ganqing expectations and their negative emotional reactions.

# 6.2.1 Lack of Feelings as Rapport Threat

Ganqing involves empathy and understanding people's feelings (Chen & Chen 2004; Yen et al. 2017; Chang 2018). This means when the Chinese communicate with the guanxi members (i.e., NPTPs in this study) with whom they are close or have a long-term relationship, the Chinese expect to be treated by the NPTPs with empathic feelings. If this ganqing expectation is not met, it would pose threats to the rapport between the two parties and result in GQVI discordant rapport, which would trigger clients' anger at the NPTPs.

For the following and the other extracts presented in Chapter 6, the turns marked with  $(\longrightarrow)$  indicate the interactional sequences in which clients' negative emotions occur, while the utterances underlined show how the discordant rapport is characterized as GQVI discordant rapport (i.e., it is caused by unmet ganqing expectations or unfulfilled ganqing obligations). C stands for the client and T refers to the therapist.

Extract 6.1 C's negative emotions occur when she discloses the prior interaction with her close friends.

1 C：我跟高中最好的那个朋友，我就唯一这么几个朋友，有一次就坐在车里，他们就说不明白我为什么把对别人的恶意转嫁给自己，说我傻，就把自己给气病了……不明白我的自卑是哪儿来的，说我不负责任，脆弱，不坚强，自己不让自己长大，就说自己不努力。

I was sitting in the car with my best friends from high school, I only had such a few friends. While we were just sitting in the car one time, they said that they couldn't understand why I turned other people's ill-will towards myself. They were calling me stupid since I pissed myself off ... They couldn't understand where my low self-esteem came from, saying I was irresponsible, fragile, not strong enough, and not letting myself grow up, and just saying that I didn't make an effort.

2 T: 嗯。Mm.

3 C: 就是他们最后把我怼哭了，我说不过他们了，几个人七嘴八舌的，就那么-本来就表达得很快。我就想说的话就说不出来，就憋得慌，好难受，最后没办法，就只能哭。他们说我不负责任，然后没想过父母，然后得这种病，也<我觉得特别不公平，他们这么说，也不是我自己愿意得的>。

They finally made me cry, it was difficult for me to argue back. They were such fast speakers that  $\mathrm{o}$  I was just denied to say what I wanted to say, I was holding back and was uncomfortable, and finally, I had no choice but to cry  $\mathrm{o}$ . They said I was irresponsible, because I didn't think about my parents, and I got this disease, which was also  $-<\mathrm{o}$  I thought it was extremely unfair that they were saying this. Being sick was not something I had wanted  ${>}^{\circ}$ .

4 T：你怎么看待他们所说的这个？

What do you think about what they were saying?

5 C: 没有人能感同身受。

So no one can really feel the same feelings as you do.

6 T: 可能我们的第一反应是你站着说话不腰疼。

Maybe our first reaction is if you don't put yourself into my shoes, you wouldn't know what I meant.

7 C: 反正不愿意接受这种说法。

Anyway, I am not willing to accept that.

8 T：或者当我们听到这种说法的时候会觉得特别孤独，

Or we'll feel particularly lonely when we hear it,

9 C: 嗯。

Mm.

10 T：会觉得他们，指望他们理解是不可能了。

It's impossible to expect them to understand.

11

C: 就是因为从大学的时候就觉得，就说不能指望另一个人理解你，所以说有的事情就不要-不要和别人说……

Just because I have felt that I couldn't expect another person to understand me from college, so certain things cannot be shared with anyone…

C discloses how she is negatively commented on by her close friends. Rather than expressing anger through sonorant cues (e.g., the high pitch register or fast tempo), C's anger towards them is displayed with more subdued cues here (Selting 2010: 239): in a low voice and slow tempo. From the negative assessment ('I thought it was extremely unfair, they were saying this', Turn 3), her anger towards them is explicitly demonstrated (Räabis et al. 2019). From C's complaints against her friends, the discordant rapport between the two parties is observable. Locating C's anger within the interactional sequences in which it occurs, a link between C's emotional reactions and the discordant rapport can be made (Spencer-Oatey 2005; Culpeper 2011).

The nature of the discordant rapport (i.e., ganqing violation-induced) is reflected in interlocutors' meta-pragmatic comments made in the subsequent turns. When C is invited by T to mention her friends' behaviour, C states that 'no one can share the same feelings with you' (Turn 5). When T responds in the next turn (Turn 6), he takes some part of the interpretation from C's prior turn and formulates it (Vehvilainen 2008: 130), in this way to show his acceptance and acknowledgement of C's argument. Moreover, T comments on C's friends as not standing in C's shoes (Turn 6) and not understanding C's feelings (Turn 10). By making these comments, T and C evoke evaluations of a threat to ganqing. This unmet ganqing expectation threatened the rapport between the two parties and evoked C's anger. The next example further illustrates how a client's anger emerges from her perceptions of GQVI discordant rapport, the latter of which is threatened by her mother's de-empathic behaviour.

Extract 6.2 C and her parents run a curtain in shop and C's mother is so devoted to the business that she neglects to care for her daughter.

1 C: 我真的挺不了，我确实是太累了。包括我怀孕的时候，整个人状态确实不行，确实太累了。我妈妈就说，“↑怎么着↑怎么就坚持不了，我们那个年代我们年轻的时候哪有这个条件，我们都能坚持，↑>你怎么就不行啊？你怎么就不能咬咬牙坚持坚持<？”我怀孕我没休息一天，我一直到最后阵痛了，把所有事情处理完了再去医院。

I really couldn't insist anymore. I was too tired. Even when I was pregnant, I was not in good condition, and I was too tired. My mother complained to me, '↑ > Why do you not insist on it now<? You should try your best to insist on and continue working'. I kept working when I was pregnant, I didn't stop working until the birth pangs came, and I finished all the work before I went to the hospital.

T: 那不知道的还以为不是亲妈呢, 是吧? 有没有怀疑过是不是亲妈?

Those who don't know about your family might think she is not your own mother? right? Have you ever suspected that she is not your own mother?

3 C：那没有，怀疑倒没有。怀孕最后一个月，孩子正是长的时候嘛，我最

后那一个月几乎没怎么吃午饭，忙到吃不了，吃不上。好不容易我卖完了，一回头，老太太又揽了一个人，>一份儿接一份儿的，一份接一份儿的<。

No, no doubt about that. During the last month of my pregnancy, and that time it was high time for the baby's growth. I didn't have lunch nearly for the whole month, I was too busy. Finally, I finished the work at hand, and when I looked behind me, my mom solicited another customer,  $>$  one by one, one by one<.

4 T：她-她感觉像个教练一样哦，在训练一个拳击手。

She - she felt like a coach who was training a boxer.

5 C: 嗯，我都饿得不行了。我说“妈呀，我实在不行了”。我这么多年，有时不吃饭太正常的事儿了，吃不上饭。怀孕的时候挺不了，说“妈呀，我太饿了，你帮我买点啥，我吃一口”。我妈买了点儿带饼的咸菜，说“↑>你吃吧！<”我一下子就真的很想哭。你说你女儿马上半个月要生了，这么累，每天挣这么多钱，真的很累得慌……Well, I'm starving. I said, 'OMG, I just can't'. I've been doing this for years, and it's not unusual for me not to be able to eat sometimes. When I was pregnant, I couldn't stand it, so I said, 'Mum, I'm so hungry, buy me something, I'll have a bite'. My mother bought some pickles with cakes and said, ‘↑>Eat it! <’ I really wanted to cry. Her daughter is about to give birth in half a month, and she is so tired, earning so much money every day, it's really tiring…

6 T: ¥她确实挺有病, 是吧? ¥确实挺变态的, 是吧?

¥ She's sick, isn't she? ¥ She must be psychologically perverted, is she psycho?

C：那倒也不是，她觉得自己挺正常的。

That's not true. She feels she is normal.

8 T：问题是她不觉得这是个问题，这不就是很变态吗？

The problem is that she doesn't think it's a problem, isn't she psychologically perverted?

9 C:￥啊,对,对

￥Ah, yes, yes.

T: 别说亲妈了，是吧？就是老板都-都不能这么对员工。

Let alone your mother, right? Even the boss cannot treat their employees in such a way.

When C discloses social interactions between her and her mother, anger, a typical type of other-condemning emotion (Haidt 2003), is displayed through the following emotional cues: (1) phonetic-prosodic cues. When C discloses how she is inattentively treated, she speaks in a high-pitch register ( $^\circ \uparrow >$  Why do you not insist on it now<, Turn 1), extra-high pitch peaks, tempo changes, and dense attenuations (Turn 5). These cues, as noted in Selting (2010: 243), are explicit indicators of C's anger. (2) Verbal cues that are reflected in the intensifiers (Räabis et al. 2019), for instance, intensifying via repetition ('one by one, one by one <', Turn 3) and the adverb ('too tired', Turn 1). (3) 'Quotes' or 'recreations of others' speech' (Besnier

1990: 426) ('My mother complained to me', Turn 1; '↑>Eat it! <', Turn 5). By upgrading and aggravating C's negative emotional stance (anger) through these linguistic and non-linguistic means (Cekaite 2016: 137), C's strong anger at her mother is communicated.

By locating C's anger in the interactional sequence in which it occurs, it can be found that it responds to the disharmony that exists between C and her mother (Işik-Güler & Ruhi 2010). In Turn 1, Turn 3 and Turn 5, C complains about how her mother does not demonstrate an understanding of her situation and does not respond to her feelings, wants, and needs (Fukushima 2015; Chang 2018). In doing so, C projects a 'negative assessment' of her mother's person, evoking evaluations of a threat to ganqing. Upon hearing C's self-disclosure, T meta/comments the mother's behaviour by using rude and aggressive words ('be sick', 'psychologically perverted', Turn 6). In Turn 10, T initiates another moral evaluation to criticize the mother's behaviour. These meta-pragmatic comments reveal that the mother's ignorance of ganqing has caused disharmony between her and her daughter, and has evoked C's anger towards her mother.

To treat specific guanxi members with ganqing not only means understanding the others' feelings (cf. Extract 6-1), understanding their situation, and responding to their needs (cf. Extract 6-2) but also means refraining from saying or doing something that would hurt the other's feelings (Fukushima & Haugh 2014: 167). Otherwise, it would pose a threat to the rapport between the two parties and evoke one party's negative emotions.

Extract 6.3 C, a middle-aged man, complains about his wife for her hurtful utterances.

What are you peeling! You can&#x27;t do anything well’. A criticism following up, a harsh state as such. No one wants it - everyone knows that it is difficult to peel the egg, and you need to do it very slowly. She cannot do it well sometimes. She is picky about you ((smacking the lips)). If you want to go home and lie down for a while, she blames you, ‘↑Ah, you are so lazy again, lie down there’.</td></tr></table>

6 T: 所以好像-好多年都没有得到过真正的安宁。

So, it seems - we haven't had any real peace for years.

10 T: =极其伤人的

$=$  Extremely hurtful

11 C: =极其伤人……

$=$  Extremely hurtful…

The disharmonious relationship between C and his wife is observable, as indicated by his complaints and criticisms towards her. When complaining, a strong degree of anger is displayed through the following cues: (1) prosodic means. When C 'quotes' or recreates his wife's speech (Besnier 1990: 426), he speaks with a high pitch register (Reber 2008, 2012) (' $\uparrow$  It's like a dog's gnawing. What are you peeling!', Turn 5). He also complains in a fast tempo (' $\rightarrow$ that sarcasm $\cdots$ $\prec$ ', Turn 9). (2) Rhetorical means. For instance, by repeating in a full, partial, or modified way, and the repetition of words and syntactic structures (Räabis et al. 2019) ('preaching all the time, lecturing you about all the time', Turn 7). (3) Lexical-semantic means. For instance, C comments on his wife's behaviour by using lexical items with negative connotations (ibid: 2) ('a harsh state', Turn 5; 'mercilessly', Turn 9). By producing a markedly loud sound, and effectively upgrading his negative stance towards his wife (Cekaite 2016: 147), C displays strong anger towards his wife.

C's anger is caused by the GQVI discordant rapport that exists between him and his wife. Specifically, C's complaining way of speaking focuses on how his wife shows little consideration for his feelings and criticizes him 'merceilessly' (Turn 3, Turn 5, Turn 7). This complaint projects a relational separation from his wife and indicates the disharmony between them (Spencer-Oatey & Xing 2003; Arundale 2010). Furthermore, T meta/comments the wife's behaviour as 'extremely hurtful' (Turn 10). By delivering such a 'moral evaluation' (Kádár & Haugh 2013) and projecting a negative evaluation of the wife's person, T displays evaluations of a threat to ganqing. C's echoing in the next turn shows his acceptance of

C's evaluation (Ferrara 1994; Pawelczyk 2011: 124). In summary, from C's complaints towards his wife and the moral evaluations of the wife's person, it can be drawn that the wife's violation of ganqing has caused disharmony between the two parties, leading to C's anger.

# 6.2.2 Anger and Sadness: Lack of Feelings as Rapport Threat

In some cases, when the interlocutors perceive there exists GQVI discordant rapport between them and the guanxi members, with the guanxi members' lack of feelings as rapport threats, the interlocutors would not only react with anger but also with sadness.

Extract 6.4 C reports on her prior interaction with her parents. C has experienced difficulties in her job and is expected to be understood and supported by her parents, but the real situation runs contrary to her expectations.

1 T：如果父母成为我们主心骨的话，我们也不会在外面这么难的啊。很少和他们联系吗？

...If our parents become our backbone, life wouldn't have been so difficult for us, do you rarely contact them?

2 C：他俩之前感情也不好，

They didn't have a good relationship before,

3 T：嗯。

Mm.

4 C：没法儿说，比如你加班的意思，就是“你-↑>不要再这样干了啊<”，你能说什么啊？你抱怨一下，他们就说你不要在这儿干了；

或者你抱怨一下，他们就说“↑>你不是有自尊吗？

你为什么还和那个人在一起啊？<”

It is difficult to say, for example, if you work overtime, they will say  $-\uparrow >$  You won't do it again<. What else could you say? If you complain, then they will tell you not to work here anymore; or if you complain, they will say,  $\uparrow >$  Don't you have self-esteem? Why are you still with that guy?

5 T: 什么也说不了。

Nothing we could complain to our parents.

I was separated from this boyfriend for a month without telling my parents. If I told them, they would say, '↑ Ah, girls need to have self-esteem, you see, you now have quarreled with him, how can you cope with each other in the future?' They have never supported me over the years.

In the above extract, C's strong anger towards her parents and strong sadness are displayed. On the one hand, a strong degree of anger is manifested through the following linguistic or non-linguistic resources: (1) prosodic resources. When C complains about her parents, she conveys her anger through a high-pitched register and a tensed voice (Selting 2010: 239). (2) The discursive strategy of recreating the other's speech (Besnier 1990). Specifically, C speaks as her parents and recreates their de-empathic utterances with extra high-pitch peaks (e.g., ‘↑> Don't you have self-esteem? Why are you still with that guy? <’, turn) and in this way displays an angry, aggravated emotional stance. On the other hand, her strong sadness is explicitly demonstrated by vocal cues (i.e., the crying sound and the choking voice in Turn 6 and Turn 10) (Hepburn & Potter 2007). Locating C's emotional reactions in the interactional sequence in which it occurs, they are responding to the discordant rapport which is signalled through C's complaining utterance about her parents.

The nature of the discordant rapport (i.e., ganqing violation-induced) is reflected in the meta-pragmatic comments made by T. Having heard C's complaining way of speaking which displays her parents' de-empathy towards her, T comments C's parents' as not empathic ('They can't understand us', Turn 9). In doing so, T issues a negative assessment of the parents' behaviour, manifesting evaluations of a threat to ganqing, since ganqing emphasizes empathic understanding and emotional understanding (Yang 1994; Chen & Chen 2004: 315). By repeating some part of T's utterance and extending it (Lerner 2004; Vehvilainen 2008), C shows acceptance of T's meta-comment (Turn 10).

Ganqing not only involves one's expectation of being empathically understood and being helped by specific guanxi members but also one's expectation of not being hurt by specific guanxi members.

This extract revolves around C's prior interaction with her mother. As the details concerning their interaction are disclosed, her anger towards her mother and strong sadness are displayed: (1) by 'quoting and recreating' her mother's criticism of her ('She said  $\uparrow$  you just threatened us with death, what else would you do?', Turn 1) with a high pitch register (Besnier 1990; Reber 2008, 2012). (2) By emotionally sanctioning her mother's inappropriate attitude and displaying annoyance (e.g., 'I really couldn't stand her attitude', Turn 1). As for C's strong sadness, it is observable from her crying sound (Hepburn & Potter 2007). Locating C's anger and anger-related sadness in the interactional sequences in which they occur, these negative emotions are responses to the disharmony between C and her mother (Isik-Güler & Ruhi 2010).

The meta-pragmatic comments made by T upon hearing C's self-disclosure reveal how he understands the nature of the disharmonious relationship that exists between C and her mother. Specifically, T meta/comments C's mother as heart-hurting ('she always speaks in such a hurting way!', Turn 12). In so doing, T makes a negative assessment of C's mother, evoking evaluations of a threat to ganqing. According to prior studies, ganqing involves caring about other's feelings (Wang 2007; Shao & Pan 2019) and not hurting others' feelings (Yen et al. 2017: 109; Zhao & Ran 2019: 269). The discussions reveal that the mother's ignorance of ganqing results in the disharmonious relationship between her and her daughter, triggering C's anger and sadness.

# 6.2.3 Anger and Sadness: Lack of Feelings and Emotional Detachment as Rapport Threat

In addition to feelings, ganqing also emphasizes emotional attachment (Yang 1994; Chang & Holt 1994; Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998; Chang 2013, 2018), inner attachment (Guo 2001), connections (Chen & Chen 2004: 315), or relational connection with others (Hsiang 1974). Though different labels are used, they all point to a common component of ganqing—a close relationship between two guanxi members. Under some circumstances, the unmet ganqing expectations involve two aspects, i.e., lack of feelings and emotional detachment.

Extract 6.6 C's negative emotions are manifested and communicated when she reveals an interaction with an intimate friend Xixi. Their friendship dates to the senior high school period and they are very close to each other for many years. Due to some reasons, C feels estranged from her.

1 C: 我们一起出来，然后你也没有问过我什么，就总是在说你和她们的关系，我是心里有点难过的，而且她还告诉我，她现在有朋友，她们关系很好。

We came out together, you didn't ask me anything but kept talking about your relationships with them. I was a little sad and she also told me she had friends and they were having good relationships.

2 T: 看起来她们更亲密一些。

It looks as if they are more intimate with each other.

<table><tr><td>3</td><td>C: 对。因为这两年我们没怎么联系之后，她总是和那几个朋友一起… …然后我也觉得-她希望就是她的女儿也 大了，去跟那些比较有上进心的啊，优秀的孩子接触…… 她让我也觉得和她离得很远，不太走得近。 That&#x27;s right. Since we have not been in touch frequently these two years, she has been spending time with other friends… And I also think that her daughter has grown up, and she wants her daughter to get in touch with children who are more motivated and aspirational…She gave me this feeling that she was far away, not very close.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>T: 看起来她好像更在乎那帮朋友，愿意和她们走得更近一些。 It looks as if she cares more about that group of friends, and would like to get closer to them.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>C: 可能吧!

So, for what kind of reason, you are dissociated from her or why you don&#x27;t contact her anymore?</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>C: 是她还和以前一样，后来会一大早问我啊什么的，我也学她，过很 久才回她，说我有事什么的。在一段时间，她总是在说我，我是 很难过的，好像有一次就是因为一个什么防蚊的一个香囊，就是 她说的我没理解，我再反过来问她的时候，她回的就是“↑你这 都不懂啊，我都已经说得很清楚，这种事情你怎么都不知道？” 让我觉得-好像这个你也太无能了，连这个东西都不知道，或者“ 我的话我怎么说你才能听得懂啊？↑你这个笨蛋！”就这种感觉，这让我觉得我很难过((哽咽的声音))。 She behaved just as before, and she would tell me some of her difficulties in the morning and ask me for advice, but I learned her way and replied to her after a long time by saying that I was busy. She reproached me frequently at that time, which made me so upset. Once I asked her about the anti-mosquito sachet, I didn&#x27;t understand what was told. When I asked her again, she responded by saying ‘↑ You don&#x27;t even understand such a simple thing like this? I have told you in such an explicit way, how can you still know little about this?’ or ‘How else can I make you understand? ↑ You stupid’. This makes me feel very sad ((choking voice)).</td></tr></table>

When C discloses the prior interactions between her and her close friend, her anger and strong sadness are discursively communicated. From the vocal cues (i.e., C speaks with a choking voice and crying sound) and the emotion word ('sad'), C displays strong sadness. As for C's anger towards her close friend, it is manifested in the following ways: (1) complaints about the friend's neglect of her ('we came out together, you didn't ask me anything

but kept talking about your relationships with them', Turn 1). In so doing, C emotionally sanctions the friend's inappropriate behaviour and conveys her annoyance (Langlotz & Locher 2013: 99). (2) By replaying or recreating (Besnier 1990) the close friend's criticism of her in an angry, emotionally aggravated way (Cekaite 2016: 143), as reflected in the high pitch register when C reproduces the friend's speech (' $\uparrow$  you don't even understand such a simple thing like this?', Turn 11). C's negative emotions, which occur when she reports on an interaction with Xixi, are responding to the disharmony that exists between her and Xixi (Spencer-Oatey 2005: 116).

From the meta-pragmatic comments T made on C's self-disclosure, the disharmonious relationship between the client and Xixi can be understood as ganqing violation-induced. On the one hand, he describes Xixi's relationship with the other friends as 'more intimate' (Turn 2), and 'get closer to them' (Turn 4), whereas depicts Xixi's relationship with C as 'dissociated' (Turn 10). In so doing, T means that Xixi has violated the relational principle of ganqing: given that ganqing emphasizes closeness (Wang 2007), connections (Chen & Chen 2004), and emotional attachment (Guo 2001). On the other hand, C's complaining way of speaking indicates that her feelings have been hurt by Xixi ('This makes me feel very sad', Turn 11). Since C complains about how Xixi hurts her feelings, it can be drawn that Xixi has threatened the ganqing with C (Chang 2013; Yen et al. 2017).

The above extract, by focusing on clients' prior interaction with a bosom friend, has illustrated how unmet ganqing expectations pose a threat to rapport and evoke clients' negative emotions. In what follows, more relational dyads between clients and NPTPs are involved, aiming to further elaborate the interrelationship between the GQVI discordant rapport and clients' negative emotions.

Extract 6.7 C's negative emotions emerge when she talks about her relationship with a boy, with whom C has dated for a long time and who has shown good affection towards C.

1 C: 我觉得是不是我自己有问题啊！……我接受不了那样一个落差，就是心里有一种挫败感，就是  $\uparrow$  明明我们关系都这么好了， $\uparrow$  明明都已经是个样子了<，

I am wondering if there is something wrong with me!… I cannot accept such a drop, and there is a sense of frustration, that is,  $\uparrow >$  we are in such good relations. It is already like this<,

2 T:嗯，

Mm,

3 C: 你还说是我误会了，心里面接受不了。我-%我就想是我哪儿不好，是不是长的特别不好看啊，我是不是性格特别不好啊！我内心就接受不了% ((抽泣))……

And you were telling me I misunderstood you, I really cannot accept this. I  $-\%$  am wondering whether I am not good in some aspects, or am I particularly bad-looking. Do I have a particularly bad personality? I really cannot accept her saying that I misunderstood it ((in a sobbing voice)) ...

T: 嗯，Mm,

C：我是在微信上和他认识的。最开始我是不喜欢他的因为他对我很关心，我们挺聊得来嘛。最开始是觉得没有办法接受他的。我是不太满意他的外貌，还有身高什么的，I met him on WeChat. At first I didn't like him, but then I accepted him because he cared about me. We had a lot of topics in common... At first, I felt that I could not accept him. I was not satisfied with his appearance and his stature,

T: 嗯，Mm,

C: ((谈论她在厦门出差时，该男孩具体如何表达关心)) 这个事情就挺让我感动的……后来我发现整件事情的发展好像在我的意料之外。((C talks about how the boy shows concern to her when she has a trip to Xiamen City)). I am deeply moved by what he has done for me… Then I find out that the whole thing seems to turn out beyond my expectations.

T: 这才是-可能是最打击我们的吧！就是[我们] That's - it's probably the thing that hit us the most! [We are

C: [就是我可能-只是想得到他，
[I may just - I just want him,

T: 听你这么说，我感觉，其实你-接受他，跟他在一起，其实是做了-很多的考虑啊=As you talk about him, I feel, you - you accept him, you've considered this a lot=

C: =↑挣扎你知道吗？就是内心 =↑Struggling, you know? My heart struggles

T: 交往那么久，最终决定想他在一起的时候，发现人家根本没想跟我们在一起。就是我们之前做的很多努力其实都是徒劳的。After we had been dating for such a long time, finally, you finally decided to accept him, but only to find that he didn't even want to be with you. That is, plenty of our previous efforts were in vain.

C: 啊，对！……Ah, yes!…

When C discloses a prior social interaction with a boy, her negative emotions manifest. On the one hand, her anger towards the boy is displayed through (1) rhetorical means. That is, the repetition of words ('obviously') and rhythm ( $\uparrow >$  we are in such good relations, it is already like this<sup>+</sup>, Turn 1). (2) Prosodic means. Specifically, the above utterance is produced in a high-pitch register, as well as a fast tempo (Selting 2010: 265). On the other hand, her sadness is communicated through a sobbing voice (Sorjonen & Peräkylä 2012). Understanding these negative emotions in interaction, they are responding to the discordant rapport C has with the boy, as reflected in C's criticism of him.

The disharmony between C and the boy is gangging violation-induced, given the following evidence. One aspect, C's complaining way of speaking ('And you were telling me I misunderstood you', Turn 3) indicates that the boy denies mutual affection between them and his good feelings towards C. Further, the joint construction of T and C (from Turn 10 to 12) indicates

that C has good feelings towards the boy. As it has been previously noted, ganqing emphasizes 'mutual good feelings' (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998: 24) and 'mutual affection' (Chan 2006). Therefore, C, by complaining about the boy's lack of feelings towards him, occasions an evaluation that the boy's behaviour has violated the relational principle of ganqing. The other aspect, T's meta-pragmatic comment, the content of which describes the boy's desire to detach himself from C ('but only to find that he doesn't even want to be with us', Turn 12), evokes evaluation of emotional detachment as well as the threat to ganqing (Guo 2001; Chen & Chen 2004; Chang 2018).

Extract 6.8 C's sadness is displayed and communicated when she reports on an interaction with her father [C cares about her father and has always expressed her love for him. As for C's relationship with her mother, she does not like her mother because of being mistreated by her mother. C's father has hoped C to do something to ease the tension with her mother but C refuses to do that.]

1 C: 上次咨询结束后((吸鼻子，抽泣))，第二天我给我爸爸打了个电话，我说想找他谈谈，问他有空吗？“他说没空，>↑有什么好谈的？没什么好谈的<”……上周六的时候，我本来就定了自己中午看电影，后来我又买了张电影票，我和他发了信息，%说我邀请你明天和我一起看电影，不管你来不来，你晚上给我回个信息%(（抽泣，哽咽))，然后就没有下文了。第二天我看电影的时候觉得还好，我觉得((哽咽着说))-我不太记得当时什么想法了，我就觉得还好……我觉得我的情绪出来是10月3号还是4号，我上午看到有我爸一个未接电话，我回过去，他没接挂了，过了一段时间他回了个信息，说给我电话是因为要找XX((C的丈夫))，叫他把放在他们那边的盒子拿走，当时XX没接，后来XX回电话了，把盒子拿走了。After the last consultation ((sniffing, sobbing)), I called my father the next day and said that I wanted to talk to him and asked if he was free. He said that he had no time. >↑ What's there to talk about? There was nothing to talk about<’… Last Saturday, I decided to go watch a movie at noon and bought a ticket, % later I bought another one. I sent a message to him and invited him to watch the movie with me the next day, and told him no matter whether he would come or not, he should send me a message by evening % ((sobbing and choking)), but no response from him later. The next day I went to the cinema, it was ok. I felt ((choking))- I don't really remember what I thought at that time, and I wasn't angry or sad. I don't really remember what I thought at the time. I just thought it was okay... Then I felt it was October 3 or 4 when I felt emotional. I found I missed a call from my father, I called back but he hung up. After a while, he sent me a message, he said he was calling me because he was looking for XX ((the name of C's husband)) and asked XX to take away the box that was left in his house. XX didn't answer the call at that time. Later XX called back and took the box away.

2 T: 你说的这些，你是怎么想的？ Do you have any comments about the interaction between you and your father that you have described above?

3 C: 我就是觉得有情绪啊，我会觉得他就是在和一个很普通的人在讲话^就是和你分得很清了，这种感觉。

I feel emotional. I feel he is talking to a very ordinary person, that is, he disassociates himself from me.

4 T: 好像就是刻意用这个话来划清界限了，我给你打电话，不是因为我惦记着你的，是吧？我是有事儿才找你的，让人听了非常心寒。

It seems that he deliberately uses these words to draw a clear line. I am calling you not because I miss you, is it? I called for something, which made us very heartbroken.

5 C: 对，我这周几次都有这种感觉，那种细微的掠过的心寒的感觉，被划了一刀，被刺了一下的感觉。

Yes, I've felt that way a few times this week, a chilling feeling. The feeling of being scratched and stabbed.

In the above extract, C discloses the prior social interactions between her and her father. From the vocal cues—the sniffing, the sobbing, and the choking voice (Hepburn & Potter 2007; Sorjonen & Peräkylä 2012), C's strong sadness is explicitly displayed. Moreover, from the discursive strategy of 'quoting or recreating the other's speech' ( $c > \uparrow$  What's there to talk about? There was nothing to talk about $<$ , Turn 1), C is displaying her negative emotional stance (annoyance) towards her father at the moment (Besnier 1990: 426). By commenting on the father's way of talking with a daughter as emotionless, a similar way of talking with a very ordinary person ('he is talking with a very ordinary person, that is, he disassociates himself from you', Turn 3), C is sanctioning the inappropriateness of her father's behaviour.

C's complaining way of speaking as well as the meta-pragmatic comments made by T reveals the disharmony between C and her father is featured as ganqing violation-induced, which is caused by unmet ganqing expectations. (1) C complains about how she is emotionlessly treated by her father (e.g., the father has rejected her request for a talk and her invitation for a movie, Turn 1; the father talks with C as if C was a very ordinary person rather than his daughter, Turn 3). In so doing, C occasions an evaluation of the father's ignorance of ganqing (Santangelo 2005; Ledeneva 2008; Shao & Pan 2019). (2) T's meta-pragmatic comments point to the father's emotional detachment and distance from C ('it seems that he deliberately uses these words to draw a clear line', Turn 4), and also the father's lack of feelings towards C ('I am calling you not because of I think about you', Turn 4). By mentioning the disconnection and lack of feelings, T occasions evaluations of a threat to ganqing.

# 6.3 Guilt and Anger (and Sadness)

Ganqing not only values social entitlements as discussed above, but also emphasizes 'relational obligation, sacrifice in giving' (Chang 2013: 44), 'living up to one's social obligations' (Yang 1994: 122), and 'mutual obligations' (Hsiang 1974). As far as the content of relational obligation

is concerned, the type of relationship between interlocutors needs to be taken into consideration (e.g., it means filial obligation within child-parent relationships). It is also worth noting that relational obligations, the important components of ganqing, affect people's perceptions of rapport. For instance, Spencer-Oatey (2008: 322) maintains that in collective cultures, 'people's dynamic construal of self can influence various rapport, including the relative emphasis they give to sociality obligation compared to sociality rights'. This means, that if Chinese people perceive themselves as not fulfilling sociality obligations when interacting with others, it would negatively influence their perceptions of rapport, resulting in significant emotional reactions (guilt and anger).

# 6.3.1 Guilt and Anger: Filial Obligation-omission as Rapport Threat

The relational obligation that is emphasized in ganqing, when it is examined in the child-parent relationship, is represented as filial obligations (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998). Filial piety can be expressed through providing monetary support, it can also be expressed through letting parents live without worry and anguish, to bringing honour to parents through one's academic achievements (Yang 1997; Kwan 2000). Accordingly, if a Chinese self perceives himself/herself as not fulfilling filial obligations, it would result in perceptions of disharmony and the self's negative emotions.

Extract 6.9 C, a man in his early 40s, hasn't received a good education and has changed his job frequently. C's negative emotions are demonstrated and communicated when he recalls a frustrating interaction he had with his mother.

1 C: 这几天，耳边都是我妈妈的声音，“你个败家子，你不节省，家里的钱都让你败光了……”，或者就是“家里拿钱你自己不好好念书，你就是有病，就是恶人，你就应该受到审判，应该受到折磨……”，我心里满满都是内疚感和罪恶感=…These days, my mother's voice is all in my head. ‘You are such a black sheep of the entire family, squandering all the money and not thrifty at all...’ or ‘You take money from home but you don't study hard, you are evil, you deserve to be tried and tortured…’, I am filled with guilt and sin =
2 T: =羞愧。=Ashamed.
3 C: 最受不了就是她对我的谴责，她总说我是败家子啊，钱都让你花了，或者家里不好都是你造成等等，我最受不了就是这个，所有事情都是你承担，所有的不幸或者是家庭的不幸福都是你造成的……，像个罪人，负罪感。

What I can't stand most is her condemnation of me. She keeps complaining that I am the black sheep of the family, that I have spent all the money in the family, or that I am responsible for the bad situation of the family... What I can't stand most is this. I seem like a sinner, and I am guilty.

4 T：可见这份指责-愧疚-的感觉是多么折磨人。

You can see how tormenting this feeling of blame - guilt is.

5 C: 我母亲总是叨叨这事儿，愧疚感，罪恶感很大。

My mother always talks about it, which makes me feel guilty.

C's self-disclosure revolves around the condemnations he receives from his mother. During his self-disclosure, two types of negative emotions are displayed. On the one hand, guilt (a typical type of self-conscious emotion as well as moral emotion) is communicated by using emotion words. On the other hand, through C's complaining way of speaking ('what I can't stand most is her condemnation of me, Turn 3'), the content of which focuses on the mother's criticism toward him, C's anger at his mother is communicated. Locating these negative emotions within the interactional sequences in which they occur, it can be drawn that guilt is triggered by the discordant rapport between the two parties (as indicated by the mutual complaints between them). As for C's anger at his mother, it can be understood as a kind of negative emotion that is triggered by guilt or is located at the later part of the 'emotional interaction chains' (Langlotz & Locher 2017: 310).

Under some circumstances, the complaining context, for instance, the reported speech or reported conversation functions as an assessment (e.g., Drew 1998; Holt 2000; Tannen 2007; Park 2018). By quoting his mother's utterances, whose content revolves around the worries and anguish C has brought to the family (Turn 3), C implicates his failure to fulfil filial obligations. Put in another way, C is occasioning a 'negative assessment' of his person and evoking evaluations of a threat to ganqing. As shown in the analysis, the GQVI discordant rapport threatened by C's unfulfilling of filial obligations has evoked C's negative emotions.

In addition to what has been discussed above, the filial obligation also involves showing care and affection to one's parents, pleasing them, and making them happy (Yue & Ng 1999; Andre 2018). If the Chinese perceive themselves as not doing these when interacting with their parents, it would occasion evaluations of a threat to ganqing and evoke their emotional reactions.

Extract 6.10 C feels guilty when she discloses the interaction with her parents. [C, a girl in her 20s, now serves in the army. Her parents were divorced when she was young. Before this extract, C reports that she asked her father to visit her when she was hospitalized, but this request was rejected by her father for being busy at the worksite.]

1 C: 所以我在他面前，我就只能就靠经济上的，没有钱了

，想花钱，开口找他要。我们的关系就只靠金钱了。

我找他要钱，他又觉得我在他面前只认钱，不关心他。

So, in front of him, I can only rely on his economic support, when I want to spend money, I will ask him for some money.

Our relationship is only based on money. When I ask him for money, he feels that I only care about money, not about him.

When C discloses the prior social interaction with her parents, guilt, and anger at her parents are observable. On the one hand, guilt (a typical kind of self-conscious moral emotion) is communicated through the emotion words ('a sense of guilt', Turn 11). On the other hand, from the complaining way of speaking (Turn 1), her anger towards her parents is discernable (Langlotz & Locher 2012). Since C's negative emotions emerge when she talks about the rapport-sensitive issues between her and her parents, they appear as responses to the disharmony that exists between them (Išik-Güler & Ruhi 2010).

The following linguistic cues reveal the causes of the disharmony. In Turn 1, C conveys her father's negative assessment of her through the reported speech ('he feels that I only care about money, but don't care about him'). In Turn 11, C assesses herself as a person who has done little for her mother ('As her only daughter, I have done so little for her'). By quoting or using the negative assessment, the content of which focuses on

C's lack of affection towards her parents (Hwang 1999), and little effort in helping and caring for the parents (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998: 26), C conveys her failure to fulfil filial obligations (Yue & Ng 1999) and evokes evaluations of threats to ganqing. Summing up, C's ignorance of ganqing causes the disharmonious relationship between her and her parents, evoking her self-conscious moral emotion(guilt). C's anger at her parents can be understood as a secondary emotion that is triggered by guilt (Langlotz & Locher 2017: 310).

# 6.3.2 Guilt and Anger and Sadness: Owing Emotional Debt as Rapport Threat

When it applies to social interaction between friends or long-term collaborative partners, the relational obligations required by ganqing can be realized through acts such as 'responses or returns' (Chang & Holt 1994: 357). Accordingly, if people perceive themselves as not appropriately responding or returning the relational partners' favour (Chang & Holt 1994: 356), it would invoke evaluations of threats to ganqing, resulting in disharmony and significant emotional reactions.

Extract 6.11 C's negative emotions emerge when she self-reports the prior interaction she had with a long-term collaborative partner.

1 C: 就是我以前可能就是想把工作做得越来越好，确实也干得挺好。别的我也不会什么，我也不会关系太乱，但是他这种人，也会指责你，说看我为你做了多少多少多少，你看你男朋友做咨询都是免费的……I might have wanted to do my job in a better way and I made it. I would not do anything else; I don't want to be in a messy relationship, but he would accuse me. 'See, I have done a lot for you. When your boyfriend had counselling here, I even didn't charge you...'

C's negative emotions arise when she discloses prior interactions with a long-term collaborative partner (collaborative partner for short, and hence after), involving both self-conscious emotion and other-condemning emotion. First, taking responsibility for her wrongful actions ('I'm the wrong one', Turn 11), indexes C's feeling of guilt (Tangney et al. 1996: 1263; Ho et al. 2004: 73). Second, C's anger at the collaborative partner is communicated through the expressive speech act (i.e., the complaint), words with negative connotations ('very disgusting', Turn 9), and the intensifiers (Langlotz & Locher 2012, 2013; Raabis et al. 2019). Third, another guilt-related emotion, strong sadness namely, is explicitly indicated through C's crying sound (Hepburn & Potter 2007; Sorjonen & Peräkylä 2012) and the intensified prosody (Muntigl & Horvath 2014). C's emotional reactions and their situations of occurrence (i.e., C's mentioning of the disharmony between them), reveal that the emotions appear as responses to the disharmony that exists between C and the collaborative partner.

Further analysis of C's complaint and T's meta-pragmatic comments reveals that the disharmony is induced by ganqing violation. First, by

quoting the collaborative partner's utterance, the content of which emphasizes the favours he has done for C (Turn 1), C is conveying a negative assessment of herself—a person who fails to respond to return the emotional debt (Chang & Holt 1994). Second, the meta-pragmatic comments ('we owe him', Turn 6; 'because we don't stand on the side of 'li' (rationality'), Turn 16) also indicate C's failure in responding or returning the favour she has received from the collaborative partner. These analyses reveal that C fails to return the emotional debts and ignores the ganqing that exists between her and the collaborative partner, resulting in the disharmonious relationship between them and her emotional reactions.

# 6.4 Conclusion

This chapter examines the negative emotions that clients display in interpersonal psychotherapy sessions, focusing on the different forms of emotional display and their social-interactional elicitors. Premised on the interpersonal pragmatics approach, the negative emotions accompanying clients' disclosing of the disharmonious relationship between them and the intimate ones are responses to the discordant rapport. The negative emotions and the corresponding social-interactional triggers are the focus of Chapter 6. With regard to emotions, anger, sadness, and guilt are the typical ones. The results indicate that a combination of emotions such as anger and guilt, and anger and sadness, is always observed. Regarding the triggers of emotions, it has been argued earlier in Chapter 3 that ganqing is an essential factor as well as a relational principle that underpins Chinese people's social interaction in intimate and close relationships. Ganqing violation-induced discordant rapport is argued as the trigger of clients' negative emotions. Given that ganqing emphasizes the elements of good feelings, emotional attachment, and reciprocity, and the rapport between clients and people from intimate and close ones can be threatened by a lack of good feelings, emotional detachment, etc., the triggers of clients' negative emotions are further differentiated.

Based on the above foundations, the different types of emotional displays and their elicitors are identified: (1) anger/anger and sadness are emotional displays when clients disclose the unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport. The rapport threats involve the NPTPs' lack of feelings and emotional detachment when interacting with clients. (2) Guilt and anger (and sadness) are emotional displays when clients disclose the unfulfilled ganqing obligation-induced discordant rapport. As for the rapport threats, they involve clients' filial obligation omission behaviour and clients' owing an emotional debt to the NPTPs.

This chapter also concerns how negative emotions are named and expressed. Few clients name anger explicitly in interaction. Anger is always

communicated through the speech act of complaining, words with negative connotations, and prosodically with the high-pitch register. Sadness is more often expressed via vocal cues such as crying and sobbing, and occasionally through emotion words such as 'upset'. Guilt can be named, described, and implicated. For instance, they explicitly name guilt, or describe a wrongful act and take responsibility. Based on the findings presented above, Figure 6.1 is drawn.

# 7 Managing Negative Emotions Through Rapport Management Strategies

# 7.1 Introduction

Based on the theoretical framework—the rapport-orientated management of negative emotions—the chapter explores how therapists manage clients' negative emotions through surrogate-based rapport management strategies. In the previous chapters, it has been discussed that each type of negative emotion has its triggers, i.e., being triggered by the unmet ganqing expectations that exist between clients and the NPTPs or by unfulfilled ganqing obligations, and therefore emotion management is closely related to the types of discordant rapport. In Section 7.2, the analysis focuses on how therapists manage feelings of anger and of anger and sadness that are evoked by unmet ganqing expectations. In Section 7.3, therapists' management of guilt and anger (and sadness) that are triggered by unfulfilled ganqing obligations is discussed.

# 7.2 Managing Anger/anger and Sadness Via Surrogate-based Rapport Management Strategies

Following on from the discussions presented in Section 7.2 concerning the display of negative emotions, I will report how therapists manage these negative emotions. To manage clients' anger/anger and sadness, therapists adopt two different surrogate roles and deploy three types of linguistic strategies, the details of which will be presented as follows. For the following and the other extracts presented in Chapter 7, the turns marked with  $(\longrightarrow)$  indicate the sequences in which the surrogate-based rapport management strategies are involved; the utterances underlined are the focus of the analysis.

# 7.2.1 Surrogating Nptps and Using Accounting Strategies

Accounts are the statements made by social actors 'to explain unanticipated or untoward behaviour'. Having been extensively researched from a remedial perspective, an account is a linguistic device whose function is

to repair norm violations and restore social equilibrium (Goffman 1971: 171-172; Buttny 1993). As far as accounts are concerned, excuses and justifications are the most frequently used ones. The following extract demonstrates how therapists serve as the surrogates for NPTPs (Coupland & Coupland 2001) and account for their behaviour by providing an excuse on behalf of NPTPs, i.e., admitting the action is problematic without accepting any responsibility for it (Firth 1995).

(1) Surrogating NPTPs and appealing to their pressure from third parties

'Duresse by powerful agents' (Schönbach 1980: 197) or higher authority (Semin & Manstead 1983; Antaki 1994) are explanations or accounts people use to minimize their or their co-interlocutors' responsibility for a failure event. During the psychotherapy sessions, therapists surrogate NPTPs and justify their ganqing violation behaviour (i.e., lack of feelings when interacting with clients or emotional detachment from clients) by appealing to pressure from a third party, in this way to tend to clients' unmet ganqing expectations and to manage their negative emotions (i.e., anger/anger and sadness).

Extract 7.1 C feels sad when she self-reports her prior interaction with her father. [C has invited her father to watch a movie and has asked him to give a reply whenever he is available or not, but the father doesn't respond at all. Later, when C notices a missed call from her father, and then she calls back. The call is rejected by her father with a message from him minutes later, informing C that he calls only to ask C's husband to take something away from his home.]

1 T: 未接来电这个事情我觉得很难过……你觉得他真的那么讨厌你吗？I am as upset as you are about the missed call incident that you described earlier… Do you think he really hates you so much?

2 C: 讨不讨厌和我已经没有什么关系了。

It has nothing to do with me whatsoever.

3 T: 还是他做了他自己不得不做的事情？

Or does he do what he has to do?

4 C: 没懂，我没听懂你的意思。

I don't understand. I don't understand what is meant by you.

5 T: 就是说，你觉得他是发自内心里真的不想和你接触，还是觉得自己不得不这样做？比如为了她的老婆远离他的女儿？

In other words, do you think your father doesn't want to contact you deep down, or do you think he has no choice but has to stay away from you, considering that your mother doesn't like you, your father keeps the same attitude as your mother, so he distances his daughter in exchange for pleasing his wife?

C：他不得不做，我相信百分之百，但是前面那条，我也只能相信一半。我觉得之前我很能理解我的爸爸，他现在确实变成了很冷酷无情的爸爸。

He has to stay away from me because of my mother, I believe it  $100\%$ , but on your first point that he doesn't want to contact me deep down. I think I understood my father before, but now he has become a very cold-blooded father.

7 T: 不过我觉得你的一些做法，可能会不会在你爸爸那里头，也会让他很困惑？

I wonder, if we thought from your dad's perspective, would some of your behaviour be confusing from your father's perspective?

8 C: 有什么？

Any examples?

9 T：比如你突然间要找他谈一谈，他会很害怕，这要谈什么啊，他很害怕是不是要作抉择，比如看电影，从来没有这种待遇，或者不知道怎么回复这条短信？

For example, if you suddenly want to talk to him, he will be terrified, wondering what the talk might be about. He might be very afraid of whether you ask him to make a choice, such as watching a movie, for he has never been treated as such, or he does not know how to reply to your message?

10 C:我-

11 T: 他会可能觉得我这把老骨头经受不了这种爱恨情仇的折腾了，想消停一下，好多事情无法面对=

He may feel that 'I am old and don't want to experience completely different attitudes (i.e. sometimes being warmly treated and sometimes being harshly criticised) from others anymore. I just want to have a quiet life and there are so many things that are difficult to settle down' =

12 C: =我这样做是因为我爸爸几个月前在我朋友圈留言……((以正常的语速和语调回忆与父亲愉快的交往经历))

=I do this because my father left a message in my WeChat a few months ago… ((C recalls the happy interaction with her father with normal speed and intonation))

C discloses the prior interaction she had with her father. Using vocal cues (i.e., choking and sniffing in Turn 1), C's deep sadness is manifested and communicated (Planalp 1998). What's more, C's annoyance towards her father is reflected in her complaints about him (Räabis et al. 2019; Selting 2010). Considering the sequential environment of C's negative emotions, it can be drawn that they are responses to the rapport threats she experienced. Specifically, it is the father's lack of feelings towards C and his emotional detachment from her that trigger the ganqing violation-induced discordant rapport (hereafter GQVI discordant rapport) between the two parties and evokes C's anger and strong sadness.

In the response in Turn 1, T begins by showing empathy ('I am as upset as you…'). Thereafter, T acts as a surrogate for C's father to account for his inappropriate behaviour. T's actions can be understood in two ways: (1) T speaks for C's father by describing his beliefs (Mazer et al. 2014: 38). Specifically, T poses alternative questions, with the first alternative question targeting C's prior understanding, thereby suggesting that it is problematic ('do you think he really hates you so much?', Turn 1) and the second alternative question suggesting a preferred understanding ('or does he do what he has to do?' in Turn 3). By presenting such a stance on

behalf of C's father, T aims to account for the father's ganqing violation behaviour; (2) T speaks by using C's father's voice (Tannen 2007) ('… he has no choice but has to stay away from you' in Turn 5). In the first part of her response in Turn 6, C ratifies T's claim that her father must act in a particular way by repeating the main part of it, 'He has to stay away from me because of my mother'. In the final part of her response, however, C continues to complain about her father's emotionless attitude towards her.

As Scott and Lyman (1968) note, in some cases, additional accounts are needed until a remedy is found and ritual equilibrium is restored. Since C is still annoyed with her father and maintains a negative attitude towards him, as portrayed in her speech act of complaint ('he has become a very cold-blooded father', Turn 6), T offers a second account on the father's behalf by appealing to psychological reasons. T speaks using C's father's voice ('I am old and don't want to experience completely different attitudes' in Turn 11). In the following turn, C does not directly ratify T's account but provides reasons for her behaviour (i.e., why she wants to talk to her father and invites him to watch a movie). When C discusses these moments, she speaks in a normal tone of voice and pitch (Couper-Kuhlen 1986: 181; Maynard & Freese 2012: 99) contrasting with her sobbing at the beginning of this extract. A decrease in the intensity of C's negative emotions and the changes in the duration of sadness are evidence of the communicative effect of T's intervention (Schwarz-Friesel 2015; Prior 2016).

To sum up, when confronted with C's sadness resulting from NPTP's ganqing violation behaviour, T acts as a surrogate for the NPTP and provides excuses on his behalf. As for the linguistic realizations of NPTP surrogacy, T addresses the NPTP by using the third-person singular pronoun 'he' and animates his beliefs (when T speaks for the NPTP) or uses the first-person singular pronoun 'I' and animates his thoughts (when T speaks as the NPTP). By acting as a surrogate for the NPTP and providing accounts on the NPTP's behalf, T manages the disharmony between C and the NPTP. From C's responses in the following turns, the surrogate-based rapport management strategy T employs is effective in managing sadness and anger.

# (2) Surrogating Nptps and Appealing to the Misdeeds of Third Parties

As discussed in Chapter 6, ganqing stresses good feelings and attachment, and it is based on these components that people form ganqing expectations. If these expectations are not met, however, it would result in GQVI discordant rapport and trigger interlocutors' negative emotions. The following extract shows how the therapist manages the client's negative emotions by managing the GQVI discordant rapport. More specifically, the therapist offers an excuse on behalf of NTPPs and accounts for their lack of feelings when interacting with the clients.

Extract 7.2 C's annoyance towards her close friends occurs when she reports how she is disrespectfully treated by them. [In the prior part of the extract, C is accused by her close friends of being too vulnerable and irresponsible to her parents.]

1 T: 其实我们得这种病，跟他们对待我们的这种方式也不能说一点儿关系也没有。

In fact, we cannot say that our illness has nothing to do with the way they treat us.

2 C: 但是-每个人不是这么被对待的吗？

But - isn't that how everyone is treated?

3 T：可是他们也有他们的资源啊。也许他们有的资源，我们没有。

But they are also resourceful in their own way. For example, when your close friends are unhappy, they can seek help from their families, who can provide your friends emotional support and assistance. Maybe they have some resources that we don't have.

4 C: 嗯。

Mm.

5 T：他们那样说我们，但并不代表说他们说的就对。

They criticize us in such a way, but that doesn't mean your friends' comments on us are correct.

6 C: 嗯。

Mm.

7 T: 当用那种道德的大帽子拍过来的时候，就是没有人会喜欢你。是吧，告诉你不负责任，你不孝顺，你愧对父母，怎么怎么样，是吧？如果我们这么说他们，他们也不愿意接受。或者-或者-或者再深刻一点说，他们之所以会这样对待我们，也是因为他们曾经被这种方式伤害过。他们只学会了这一种方式，他们不会其他的尊重别人的方式，不是他们坏，是他们不会。

Your friends give you moral evaluations. You are evaluated as irresponsible, not filial. These make you feel ashamed in front of your parents and make others dislike you. They stand on the moral high ground just, won't they? They are claiming et cetera, et cetera aren't they? If we criticize them in such a way, they are not willing to accept it. Or - or - or, to put it more profoundly, they treat us like this because they have been hurt in this way. They have only learned such a way. They will not respect others in other ways. It's not that they are bad, it's because they don't know how to treat people any other way.

8 C：嗯，我也没有怪他们。其实他们也是为了我好。

Mm, I don't blame them either. They do it for my good.

9 T: 最糟糕的就是他们是为了我们好，但是他们做的事情却让我们很痛苦，是吧？=

The worst thing is that when they evaluate you in this way, their underlying intention is good, hoping that you can quickly overcome the difficulties of mental illness. But they achieve their intentions through moral criticism, which is very painful for you. Right? =

10 C: =是，你说的，

= Yes, indeed,

<table><tr><td>11</td><td>T: =对吧?但是我们又不能怼回去,是吧? 因为大家是出于好意。那怎么办呢? =Right? But we cannot retaliate against their moral criticism. Right? Because they criticize us in the hope that we can get out of our psychological distress as soon as possible, and their intention is good. What are we supposed to do?</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>C: 都是最亲近的人,最好的人,朋友。 Those who criticize us morally and remind us to quickly get out of the psychological distress are the closest ones, the best people and friends.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>T: 这不是产生抑郁的原因吗?一种打掉了牙让肚子里咽的苦。这种苦越多,人就越抑郁。 Isn&#x27;t that the cause of depression? Just like pulling out one&#x27;s teeth and letting one swallow the pain. The more people suffer, the more depressed they become.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>C: 那,¥也没办法啊,又不能换一拨人¥。 Well, ¥there&#x27;s no way, I can&#x27;t replace my friends with another group of people ¥.</td></tr></table>

In the above interaction, C feels annoyed because her close friends fail to show consideration for her feelings (Fukushima & Haugh 2014) by blaming her as too fragile and not responsible for her parents. Judging from C's complaints towards them, the discordant rapport between them is noticeable and it is the NPTP's ganqing violation behaviour that has evoked her anger. Before T manages the discordant rapport, T provides emotional support by justifying her life circumstance ('we cannot say that our illness has nothing to do with the way they treat us', Turn 1) and conveys to C a sense of being understood (Pawelczyk 2011: 197). In Turn 5, T sides with C and provides emotional support by challenging the correctness of the NPTP's comments ('but that doesn't mean your friends' comments on us are correct'). C minimally responds with a particle  $mm$  that is produced with a slightly falling intonation (Turn 4 and Turn 6), weakly acknowledging T's evaluation (Gardner 1997; Weiste 2016).

Then, T serves as a surrogate of C's close friends and accounts for their behaviour. He addresses C's close friends by using the third-person plural pronoun 'them' and offers an excuse for them ('they treat us like this because they have been hurt in this way', Turn 7). In so doing, T accounts for C's friends' ganqing violation behaviour and denies full responsibility for their actions (Firth 1995: 200). T further speaks for C's friends and excuses their lack of consideration of C's feelings ('It's not that they are bad, it's that they don't know how to treat people any other way...', Turn 7). In her response in Turn 8, C ratifies T's accounts by 'providing further disclosure' (Pawelczyk 2011: 192) and gives a positive evaluation to NPTPs ('They do it for my good'). Thereafter, T provides emotional support by 'speaking from clients' experience' (ibid: 191) and upgrading the emotional aspect of C's experience by verbalizing its emotional load

'…which is very painful for you'). C's ratification of T's emotive expression is observable (as indicated by the interactional strategy of latching in Turn 10).

As for C's response, she replies with a minimal confirming token 'mm' and points out the good aspects of the NPTP's behaviour, which indicates that the excuse is acknowledged by C. According to Firth (1995: 200), 'if the account is honoured, social order is restored' or the 'ritual equilibrium' is restored (Goffman 1971: 171-202). From C's positive evaluation of the NPTPs ('They are the closest ones, the best people and friends', Turn 12), a positive attitude towards their relationship is discerned. What's more, the communicative effect of emotion management is noticeable from the embodiment of positive emotions (Burch & Kasper 2016), which is displayed through her laughter in Turn 14 and later turns (data not shown here).

(3) Surrogating NPTPs and appealing to their impairment

Excuses can be linguistically realized by appealing to NPTPs' physical impairments or the misdeed of third parties (Schönbach 1980; Semin & Manstead 1983). The following is an example:

Extract 7.3 C's anger displays when she discloses how her husband fails to attend to her feelings and needs when she is ill.

[1-4 turns are omitted]

5 C: 我说我胃疼，我老公也不管我。你说原先你总是说我事儿多，我最需要你关心的时候，你不关心我……老公也不关心我……((讲述回到房间后她丈夫的行为)) I said I had a stomach ache, and my husband didn't care. He always complained that I was too busy. When I needed his attention, he didn't care about me…and my husband didn't care about me…((talked about her husband's behaviour after they returned to the hotel room))

6 T: 我的体会哦，也许他一直想关心你，但是他可能在外边，他想保持一点儿尊严。 According to my understanding, maybe he always wants to care about you, but when he is outside, he wants to keep a little dignity. Many men view excessive obedience to women as a lack of dignity. For example, when you mentioned that he was shopping with his leader, even though you suddenly felt unwell and asked him to go back to the hotel to take care of you, he still hoped to continue to be with his leader instead of showing obedience to his wife.

7 C: 那不是啊，我觉得我都有胃病了，他不能这样啊！ That's not true, I think I have stomach trouble, he can't act like this!

8 T: 我刚听你的意思，他私下里头和在人前对你的态度是不一样的。 I just saw what you mean, he treats you differently when there are outsiders than when there are no outsiders.

<table><tr><td>9</td><td>C: 那对啊，就像变了个人似的，太不一样了。
That&#x27;s right, He acted so differently, like a different person. It&#x27;s so different.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>T: 其实这方面特别显示出男人的脆弱哦！
This shows the vulnerability of men!</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>C: 他脆弱吗？
Is he vulnerable?</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>T: 这当然是一种脆弱。他希望自己的老婆在公众场合听他的，给他面子。可能在他的心目中，有的时候男人的面子更为重要。
This is, of course, a vulnerability. He wants his wife to listen to him in public and give him face. Maybe in his mind, sometimes a man&#x27;s face is more important.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>C: 他有的时候就是很好面子。比如他觉得问别人是一种无知的表现，比如问路……
He sometimes cares so much about his face. For example, he thinks asking others is a kind of ignorance, such as asking the way…</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>T: 那是一种展现自己无知啊，或者脆弱的一种表现，是吧？
It&#x27;s a kind of showing ignorance or a sign of vulnerability, isn&#x27;t it?</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>C: 对。可是他为什么呢，他这样我痛苦啊！
Yes. But why, he makes me so miserable!</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>T: 是啊，爱面子是他的一个恶习，如果我们在人前的时候多迎合这一点……
Yes, it&#x27;s a bad habit of him to worry about losing face. If we cater to this point more in front of people…</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>C: 我觉得我已经够不和人家攀比了。
I feel like I rarely compare myself with others.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>T: 有没有看那个电视剧-不要和陌生人说话，女主角的老公在外面做得很好，回家就揍她……
Have you watched the TV play named Don&#x27;t Talk to Strangers, the heroine&#x27;s husband behaved very well outside but beat his wife when got home…</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>C: 你这么说，我老公这样对我好像还好一些。
If you say so, my husband seems to be treating me better..</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>T: 是啊！……
That&#x27;s right!…</td></tr></table>

C's anger is evoked by unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport. To manage C's anger, T acts as a surrogate for C's husband to account for his ganqing violation behaviour. T's action can be understood as speaking for C's husband by describing his beliefs (Mazer et al. 2014: 18). Specifically, he provides reasons for the husband's inattentive behaviour ('maybe he always wants to care about you, but when he is outside, he wants to keep a little dignity', Turn 6). By presenting such a stance on behalf of C's husband, T accounts for the husband's ganqing violation behaviours.

This account, however, is not ratified by C, as shown in her explicit disagreement in the next turn (Turn 7). Then, T continues to speak on behalf of C's husband by appealing to his impairment (McLaughlin et al. 1983; Schonbach 1980). In attributing C's inappropriate behaviour to his

vulnerability ('This shows the vulnerability of men! Turn 10), T explains why C's husband fails to show concern for C's feelings and needs. T further supports that C's husband has the impairment of vulnerability until this account is accepted by C (Turn 12, Turn 14). In Turn 15, C responds with an acknowledgement token of yes, showing her ratification of T's argument (Pawelczyk 2011; Weiste 2016). C's response also shows the restoration of the social order or ritual equilibrium (Goffman 1971; Firth 1995).

The positive changes in C's emotional status are observable. Before the intervention, C's anger towards her husband is explicitly signalled through the high-pitched voice and the speech act of complaints (Selting 2010; Raabis et al. 2019). C's anger fades away as the intervention continues, which can be observed in the normal pitch when she asserts that her husband is acting in a better way than some of the other men (Turn 19), which compares with her complaining way of speaking when talking about her husband before this extract.

(4) Surrogating NPTPs and appealing to their needs for face maintenance 'The need for facework' (face maintenance or reputation building) is another reason people that people appeal to account for the failure event (Semin & Manstead 1983; Antaki 1994: 31). Therapists surrogate NPTPs and account for their lack of good feelings when interacting with clients.

Extract 7.4 C's sadness arises when she reports that her good feeling towards a boy is not reciprocated by him. [C and an alumnus have known each other for a long time. During this period, the alumnus shows his concern and admiration for C. When C is about to accept the boy as her boyfriend, C is told by him that she has misunderstood him and he doesn't like C at all.]

In the above extract, C's anger and sadness are evoked by the unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport. It is C's boyfriend's lack of feelings (i.e., he fails to reciprocate the good feeling to C) that threatens the rapport. To manage negative emotions, T firstly points out that C lacks real feelings towards the boy (Turn 7 and Turn 9). C's ratification of

T's argument is indicated by the interactional strategy of latching and by building her comment as an extension of T's prior turn (Turn 8 and Turn 10) (Pawelczyk 2011: 194).

Based on this shared understanding, T serves as the surrogate of C's boyfriend and gives a reason on behalf of him to account for why C's good feelings towards the boy are not reciprocated. Specifically, he addresses C's boyfriend by using the third-person singular pronoun 'he' and animates his beliefs (Tannen 1986, 2004; Gordon 2009) ('because he doesn't feel your love for him, So, he said he didn't like you', Turn 15 and Turn 17). That is, the boy didn't feel C's love towards him. In so doing, T speaks for the boy and accounts for his ganqing violation behaviour. In her response, C ratifies T's account not only by mere 'yes' statements (Turn 16, 18, 22), but also by providing further disclosure (Turn 18) and accounting for the boy's behaviour (Turn 22). Positive changes in C's emotional status are observable after the intervention, as signalled through the valence of emotion (i.e., her laughter and her smiling voice, Turn 12, 14, 20). Before this extract, C's sadness is explicitly communicated through her crying voice (data not shown here).

(5) Surrogating NPTPs and appealing to clients' responsibilities

During the psychotherapeutic discourse, clients' negative emotions arise when they experience emotional detachment from NPTPs. Under such a circumstance, therapists manage these negative emotions by offering an excuse, e.g., by appealing to the responsibilities of clients.

Extract 7.5 C's negative emotion of sadness emerges when she reports how she experiences exclusion when interacting with a close friend.

1 T：为什么她和你在一起的时候，总是提那几个朋友？

Why does she always mention those friends when she is with you?

2 C: 我不知道，我也有朋友。在她面前的时候，也不会提谁谁谁对我多好。

I don't know. I also have friends, too. I won't mention who is good to me in front of her.

T：是啊，因为我们知道如果那做，对方不好受。你和别人的关系可能会偷偷好，但是也不会拿出来显摆，是不是？

Yes, because we know that if we do that, the other party will not feel well. You may have a good relationship with others, but you won't show it off, will you?

4 C: 是。

是。

T: 那样会刺激人的。不过有一种可能你会那么做。比如两人谈恋爱，女孩和男孩说，今天和谁吃了一顿饭啊，故意用这种方式去刺激这个男孩，为什么要这样？

That would be provoking. But there's a possibility that you might do that. For example, when two people fall in love, the girl tells the boy whom she has dinner with today, that she deliberately stimulates the boy in this way, why?

C：我没有听太懂。

I don't quite understand.

T：女孩和男孩在热恋中，但是因为什么吵架了，后来女孩就告诉男孩，她和谁谁谁吃饭了。为什么要这样？

The girl and the boy fall head over heels in love, but they quarrel because of something. Later, the girl tells the boy whom she dines with. Why does the girl do this?

C：吃醋啊。你说的例子我不太喜欢，但是我知道你的意思。

我自己不会这样的，如果我很珍惜这段感情，我自己不会这样的……不过现在这种方式也挺好的，我想约她就约……

Because of jealousy. I don't like the example you say, but I know what you mean. I won't do it myself if I cherish this relationship, I won't do it like this...but it is a good way now, I'd like to ask her out...

T：所以你们之间的关系的节奏都是你控制的？

So the rhythm of your relationship is controlled by you?

C: ((笑)).

((Laughing)).

T：是吧？>↑你想保持在什么距离就什么距离上？<如果你是她，你什么心情？

Right?  $>\uparrow$  You can stay at whatever distance you want.< If you were her, how would you feel?

C: ¥很恼火¥

 ¥Very annoyed¥

T：然后在你面前说几句不爱听的，↑你就怎么了？

$\succ$  本身我就很有气的  $<$  ，对不对？

Then I say something in front of you that you don't like to hear,
↑what's the matter with you? >↑In fact I am very angry myself<, aren't I?

C：我想起来了……[省略4个话轮]

I remember something … [4 turns omitted]

T：那是不是意味着她是很在乎你的，或者她对这段关系是小心翼翼的？

Does that mean she cares so much about you, or does it mean she's careful about the relationship?

C：我在想有可能。她可能觉得关系好才那样说。她是聪明能干，但是她在情感方面其实也很脆弱。

I think it is possible. Or to say that because she assumes, she has a good relationship with others. She is very clever and very capable, but she's also emotionally vulnerable.

T：看起来她-她还是很珍惜这份友谊的。当你们走得近的时候，她会可能觉得很随便。有的时候她说话啊，或者训你的方式，都像-很随便的家里人一样，但是可能我们比较脆弱，她对我们没有见外，但是我们觉得你这么不见外，容易伤人=

It seems that she-she still cherishes this friendship very much. When you get close, she may feel very casual. Sometimes she talks or teaches you in the same way as a very casual family member, but maybe we are vulnerable. She doesn't see us as outsiders, but we think such a manner is easy to hurt people and easy to hurt people=

C: =对。是这样。

=Yes.That's right.

In the above extract, C's anger towards her close friend and strong sadness are triggered by unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport (threatened by her close friend's emotional detachment and lack of feelings towards her). Having identified the cause of the negative emotions, T uses several linguistic strategies to account for the NPTP's ganqing violation behaviour.

First, T justifies the NPTP's behaviour by 'transcendence' (i.e., placing the problematic event in a different, positive context) (Ware & Linkugel 1973; Benoit 2015: 25). T asks C to think about why Xixi always talks about other friends in front of her (Turn 1). Not having obtained the desirable answer from C, a certain communicative mode between a boy and a girl in love is offered by T (Turn 5 and Turn 7), serving as a hint for the question. C's response ('but I know what you mean', Turn 8), indicates that the hint works. By employing transcendence, T intends to minimize the severity of the offence and the negative influence on the perceived rapport. Although this justification strategy is recognized by C, it is not well accepted by her, as evidenced by the expression that she would not act in that way ('…I won't do it like this', Turn 8).

Second, T serves as the surrogate of C's friend and speaks like her. Specifically, T animates C's friend's voice and talks as if he were her (Choe 2020: 70) ('↑ What's the matter with you? >↑ I am very angry <', Turn 13; '>↑ You can stay at whatever distance you want?', Turn 11) in a complaining tone (as shown in the high pitch register and tensed voice, cf. Selting 2010). In so doing, T serves as the surrogate of C's friend and challenges the appropriateness of C's communication habits, given that this habit has violated the moral order of fairness (Kádár & Haugh 2013: 73). C's response, which expresses that she would be very angry if she were in her friend's position (Turn 12), indicates that she has realized the inappropriateness of her behaviour. In this way, T appeals to C's responsibility in the GQVI discordant rapport and reduces the NPTP's responsibility for ganging-violation behaviour.

Third, the closeness between C and her close friend is utilized by T to account for C's friends' inappropriate way of talking: that C has been treated by Xixi as a family member explains why Xixi talks with her in such a casual way (Turn 19, 21, 23). C ratifies T's account by providing further disclosure (Turn 20) and by latching an immediate agreement (Pawelczyk 2011: 194) with T's account. As for the communicative effect of T's intervention, positive changes in C's emotional status are observable from the vocal cues (i.e., signalled through her laughter in turns 10 and 12), contrasting with her crying sound when she talks about the unmet ganqing expectations.

In sum, T first justifies the NPTP's ganqing violation behaviour through the strategy of transcendence, but he finds that it is less effective. Then, T

surrogates the NPTP and offers another justification by appealing to C's responsibility in the failure event, which is accepted by C in the later turns.

(6) Surrogating NPTPs and appealing to their negative past

When accounting for violence, offence, or problematic events, people can appeal to a wide range of factors (Blumstein et al. 1974; Gordon 2011; Gerholm 2011). According to Schonbach (1980: 197), people can excuse themselves by appealing to a negative past, for instance, a childhood under oppressive situations can serve as an excuse.

C's anger is caused by the unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport, and C's mother's failure to attend to her feelings and needs is the cause of the disharmony. To manage C's negative emotions, T serves as the surrogate of C's mother and excuses her ganqing violation behaviour by appealing to her 'negative past' (Schönbach 1980: 197). This is achieved through a series of turns.

First, a 'pre-accounting sequence', the content of which negates the mother's intention to hurt the daughter, is initiated by the therapist (Terasaki 2004[1976]; Schegloff 2007). This sequence is realized through a question-answer sequence. In Turn 9, a question targeting the reason for the mother's ganqing violation behaviour is proposed. In Turn 14, T speaks for C's mother by using an assertion ('She wasn't out of hostility or not loving her daughter'). In Turn 15, C responds with the acknowledgement tokens ('Yes, yes, yes') and provides further information. This shows C's acceptance of T's argument.

Then, the therapist speaks on behalf of C's mother and constructs an account for her ganqing violation behaviour. In Turn 16, an interrogative is initiated by T to explain the mother's behaviour. At Turn 18, he provides an answer by drawing on C's response, however, this is disclaimed by C in the next turn. Based on the further self-disclosure C makes on her mother, T speaks for C's mother by referring to her in the third person pronoun and providing an account of her behaviour in Turn 20. That is, to account for the mother's behaviour by appealing to her negative past. As for C's response, she demonstrates agreement by echoing T's utterance, indicating her acceptance of the account and the restoration of the social order (Blumstein et al. 1974; Goffman 1971: 171-202). This process also witnesses a positive change in C's emotional status. At the beginning of this extract, a strong degree of anger is displayed through C's high-pitched voice, the intensifiers ('very'), and the speech act of complaints. After the

enactment of accounting, a weakened status of negative emotion is communicated, as reflected through the mitigators ('…a little sad', Turn 23) she used to describe her feelings. This analysis shows that negative emotions caused by unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport can be managed by surrogate-based rapport management strategies (i.e., serving as surrogates of NPTPs and accounting by appealing to their negative past).

# 7.2.2 Pseudo-surrogating Clients and Using Aggressive Strategies

Aggressive strategies, which are linguistically realized using criticisms, insults, and accusations, are employed by speakers to respond to rudeness (Beebe & Waring 2005). By using such a strategy, the speaker can 'wound the addressee or bring a third party into disrespect' (Allan & Burridge 2006: 79), given that the discursive strategy of 'moral aggression' is linked to morality and can be used for 'the construction of the moral order' (Parvaresh & Kádár 2019: 4). The following extract demonstrates how the therapist performs 'pseudo-surrogacy (Mazer et al. 2014) and attacks the NPTP's ganqing violation behaviour.

(1) Pseudo-surrogating clients and criticizing NPTPs' ganqing-violating behaviour

The speech act of criticism refers to 'a speaker saying that s/he thinks someone else is doing something bad' (Wilkins 1986: 578), which shows the speaker's disapproval. During the dyadic therapist-client interaction, NPTPs' behaviours revealed in clients' self-disclosure are open to evaluation. Therapists often employ criticism to express their dissatisfaction with the inappropriateness of NPTPs. Stating a fact and rhetorical questions are the common ways to criticize (Tang 2016: 120).

Extract 7.7 C's annoyance towards her long-term collaborative partner arises when she reports how she is not empathically responded to by him.

In the above interaction, C's anger and sadness are manifested by her high-pitched voice, speech acts of complaint, and an act of crying (Planalp 1998; Langlotz & Locher 2013). These negative emotions are caused by the GQVI discordant rapport between C and her collaborative partner. More specifically, it is because he shows little concern for C's feelings that has threatened the rapport between them and evoked C's emotional reactions.

According to Chaemsaithong (2012: 469), the speakers can signal who they are at any interactional moment by resorting to linguistic markers such as a change in tone and pitch and style-shifting. Confronted with C's negative emotions, T states 'for what reason' in a high-pitched voice and a rushed manner (Turn 2), using a pitch and tone similar to C. During this process, T serves as a pseudo-surrogate by speaking as if C is unable to speak for herself (from C's prior turns, C is fully capable of expressing herself). By echoing the therapist literally and with the same intonation pattern, C ratifies T's comments and shows her affiliation with T (Pawelczyk 2011: 124) in Turn 3. Moreover, further self-disclosure, in which C releases her suppressed aspects of experience and emotional tensions (ibid: 97), is reported by C.

In the later turns, T continues to pseudo-surrogate C and speaks as C, as indicated through the use of the inclusive 'we' pronoun ('…our feelings, our joy, anger, and sorrow are unimportant, Turn 7'), and in a similar high

pitch<sup>1</sup> (Choe 2020: 63). When T speaks as C, T is attacking C's collaborative partner, thereby reducing his social image (Meibauer 2014).

To sum up, by pseudo-surrogating C, T aggressively criticizes C's collaborative partner's lack of feeling. According to the discordant rapport orientations laid out earlier in Chapter 4(cf. Section 4.3.2), T's practice is dedicated to maintaining disharmony between C and her collaborative partner. Such a surrogate-based rapport management strategy functions to reduce C's negative emotions. On the one hand, it helps C release emotional tension, as manifested by her echoing T's position (Ferrara 1994), extending T's dissatisfactory stance towards her collaborative partner (Turn 3 and Turn 7). On the other hand, the process of rapport management witnesses the minimizing of C's anger and sadness (Fiehler 2002: 79), that is, she speaks angrily in a high-pitched voice at the start of the extract (Turn 1), followed by a lower and softer voice in the latter part of the extract (Turn 11).

(2) Pseudo-surrogating clients and accusing NPTPs of ganqing-violating behaviour

Accusing someone involves 'displaying a negative affective and moral stance about the conduct of another party' (Haugh & Sinkeviciute 2018: 249). In making an accusation, the accuser is claiming that the accused has transgressed moral orders or has done wrong things. Accusations 'function to construct and maintain social order' (Castor 2015: 20). When therapists accuse NPTPs, they not only show their disapproval of their misdeeds but also believe that NPTPs are guilty of doing that. The following extract shows how therapists pseudo-surrogate clients and accuse NPTPs' ganqing-violating behaviour through utterances with derogative meanings.

Extract 7.8 C's negative emotions occur when he reports how he is inattentively treated by his mother.

[4 turns are omitted].

C：我妈说，我知道你疼，牙疼不是病，疼起来要命，你给消停

一点。可我就是疼，就是想发泄一下。后来就吃点儿牙-

疼损，那个吃了也疼，我妈就说“牙疼咋的啊？↑你咋就挺不了！

真的↑就给我↑气：……的啊！当时疼痛了，疼肿了，疼肿了……

My mother said I knew your tooth hurt, toothache was not a disease, but the pain was terrible, you should calm down. But it hurt, I just wanted to let it out. I took some medicine later, but it didn't work well. Then my mother said, it is only the toothache, '↑ why you could not bear it?' I was so angry:......, the pain was terrible and the tooth was swollen with pain, the tooth was swollen with pain...

6

T： 嗯。

Mm.

7

C：我同学都说，你回家说说你妈，你妈咋这样呢？

但是我回家我还是忍住了。对了，

我妈还咋说呢，“我大儿子挺住啊！我大儿子最坚强啊！”哎：....忍啊！

All my classmates said that my mother should be criticized. How

could she behave in such a way? But when I got home, I held my

temper. By the way, what did my mother say? She said that 'my

son could bear the pain, and my son was the toughest!' Well:  $\uparrow$  it

was difficult to hold back the temper.

8

T: 多憋屈啊! =

How suffocating it is!

C:  $= \uparrow$  愕屈，确实是憋屈。

$= \uparrow$  It is suffocating.

T：这种事情还挺多=

C: =嗯，还有，我得个病毒性感冒，那几天吐得都起不来了，打完吊瓶，立马给我送学校去了，到了学校我照样吐。

$= \mathrm{{Mm}}$  ,also, I had a viral cold, I kept vomiting those days and I could

not get up, when I had finished the injection, my mother sent me

to school immediately, and I vomited when I was at school.

12

T：她也没有说让你回来？

She didn't ask you to come back?

13

C: =没。有一次医生都说，说这当妈的不够格，真的。那次我阑尾炎，

疼得都不行了，我妈就说疼疼得了，肚子疼还能咋的。之后我受

不了了，就自个儿去医院，阑尾炎都要穿孔了。后来医生都和我

妈说，你这个家长咋这样呢？这个娃儿都要穿孔了。

=No. Once my mother was commented by a doctor as incompetent,

she was. That time I got appendicitis and it hurt so badly. My

mother just let me hurt. She said it didn't matter to have stomach

pain. I couldn't bear it anymore, and then I went to the hospital,

only to find the appendicitis was in a terrible condition. The

doctors criticized my mother, saying she shouldn't have treated

me like that, and that my appendix was about to perforate.

14

T：你妈没说什么？

Didn't your mother say anything?

15

C：没说啥，她一遇到这种事情就说我不知道，她还觉得挺委屈的。之后还是这样，没变，让我觉得↑很反感。

No. She said that I didn't know when she met this kind of thing, she

even felt aggrieved. She remained unchanged since then, which

makes me feel  $\uparrow$  very disgusted.

16.

T：感觉她总是无动于衷，有的时候，就是无论我们遭什么罪，她好像都无动于衷。

It seems that she is always indifferent, and sometimes, whatever we

suffer, she seems to be indifferent.

17

C：她最在意的是学习，学习是第一位的。但是我感觉，咋说呢？

你没命了，你还咋学啊？我说我生病了不能好好听课，她说你就将

就一点儿，说能多学点儿是一点儿。

What she cares about most is study. But I feel, how do I put it? If

you were dead, how could you do your study? I tell her that it is

difficult to focus on the study when I am ill. She would reply that

a little more is better than nothing and ask me to accumulate little

by little.

As C's self-disclosure reveals, his mother doesn't pay much attention to his needs and feelings. This unmet ganqing expectation negatively influences C's perceived rapport, as reflected in the speech acts of complaints towards his mother. C's strong degree of anger is manifested through negatively valued adjectives, prosodic cues, raised pitch, increased loudness, rhetorical questions, and several intensifiers (Drew 1998; Selting 2012; Prior 2016: 226; Raabis et al. 2019).

Upon hearing C's mother's lack of concern for C's needs when C's tooth hurts, T initiates a zero-person construction, i.e., 'How suffocating it is!' (Turn 8) (Ruusuvuori 2005: 210) to show his recognition of T's experience (Voutilainen et al. 2010). It also verbalizes C's emotional status now. After more disclosure is provided, T serves as a pseudo-surrogate of clients (as reflected in the 'we' pronoun) and initiates a 'moral evaluation' (Kádár & Haugh 2013: 6) to point out the inappropriateness of C's mother's behaviour: whatever the child is suffering, the mother is turning a blind eye to it ('whatever we suffer, she seems to be indifferent', Turn 16). An utterance with such derogative meaning shows the mother's behaviour has transgressed the relational principle of ganqing—a parent shows concern for the child's feelings and needs (Hwang 1987; Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998). The intervening process has witnessed the changes in C's emotional status: a high degree of anger at the beginning of the extract, and a weakened degree of negative emotions at the later part of the extract (e.g., signalled through the normal pitched voice in Turn 17).

(3) Pseudo-surrogating clients and abusing NPTPs' ganqing-violating behaviour

Sometimes therapists will serve as pseudo-surrogates of clients and use abusive words to comment on NPTPs' emotional detachment. The abuses, which are linguistically realized through rude, offensive, and aggressive words, display strong dissatisfaction or anger towards the NPTPs. In so doing, therapists are dedicated to protecting clients' association rights.

Extract 7.9 C feels very sad and angry because her affection is not mutually shared and reciprocated by her boyfriend.

In this extract, it is C's boyfriend's ganqing violation behaviour (lack of good feelings towards C and emotional detachment) that has threatened the rapport between them, and thus evoked C's anger and sadness. During the process of emotion management, T serves as a pseudo-surrogate of the client and speaks for her (Mazer et al. 2014; Choe 2020). Specifically, it is reflected in T's uses of the inclusive 'we' pronoun when he comments on C's boyfriend's behaviour (Turn 1, Turn 3).

Based on such a surrogate role, the aggressive strategies, which aim to criticize the boy's inappropriate behaviour, are enacted in a step by step way. In Turn 1 and Turn 3, T formulates C's prior utterance, which is ratified by C in the next turns through the acknowledgement token 'yes' and through C's further disclosure of her experience (Pawelczyk 2011) (Turn 4). It seems that T intends to give an evaluation but it is interrupted by C, as manifested through the overlapping utterance in Turn 5. After ratifying C's utterance through an acknowledgement token 'yes', T points out the 'moral fault' (that is, infringement, misbehaviour) of the NPTP: the boy is playing with the affection (Turn 7). In her response in Turn 8, C shows a disaffiliating response by uttering 'I don't know'. In Turn 11, an abusive expression 'insane' is initiated by T to criticize the NPTP's ganqing violation behaviour.

C echoes T's abusive expression with a heightened voice, which indicates C's demonstration of empathic agreement with it (Pawelczyk 2011: 124).

In Turn 14 and later turns, C gives further self-disclosure with an increased pitch and a louder voice, compared with her low-pitched sad voice at the beginning of this extract. This manifests the communicative effect of therapists' intervention on clients' negative emotions.

# 7.2.3 the Combined Strategy

Under some circumstances, a combined strategy will be adopted by therapists when managing clients' negative emotions that are caused by GQVI discordant rapport. The following is an example.

Extract 7.10 C, who is a pharmacist in a large hospital, talks about a prior interaction with a good friend A (a chair of a department). Before this extract, C discloses an interaction that makes her sad and angry. One day, A calls to ask for C's accompany to the beauty department of the hospital for a consultation. C agrees and goes to the beauty department in advance, aiming to say hello to the colleagues there and affiliating A's consultation. When C arrives and only finds that A has contacted the chair of the beauty department and they know each other quite well.

C's anger is triggered by unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport, and her close friend's failure to consider her feelings is the cause of the disharmony. When managing clients' negative emotions, two types of surrogate-based rapport management are involved.

First, T serves as the pseudo-surrogate of C and employs aggressive strategies. The use of inclusive 'we' in Turn 1 shows how T pseudo-surrogates C. T speaks on behalf of C and criticizes C's friend's inappropriate behaviour ('maybe it would be better if she could start talking to us about it directly', Turn 1). Further, T directly speaks as C ('I wasn't being taken seriously', Turn 5) and points out the negative consequences caused by C's friend's inconsideration of C's feelings ('that I was being played with', Turn 5). T's criticism towards C's friend's behaviour is also reflected in the negative meta-pragmatic comments he made (i.e., 'it is inappropriate', Turn 5). C agrees with T, as manifested through her echoing of T's words (Turn 6).

Then, more information concerning C's interaction with her close friend is disclosed, and the details are omitted due to space limitations. Drawing on C's self-disclosure, a meta-pragmatic comment, which targets C's friend's problematic habit of showing up at a gathering, is provided by T ('Why doesn't she always show up!' Turn 30). Upon hearing the negative comment, further information is given by C in Turn 31, dedicated to accounting for her friend's problematic behaviour. C shows affiliation in the next turn.

Based on the shared knowledge that is established, T addresses C's friend in a third singular form and describes her beliefs. By surrogating C's friend and speaking on behalf of her, T justifies her act by claiming "that [the]effect has been misrepresented' (Antaki 1994: 50; also refer to Semin & Manstead 1983), in this way to deny the injury to C. In C's response in the next turn, a verbalized acceptance is stated (Turn 35).

After the account is acknowledged, as shown in C's verbalized acceptance in the next turn, positive changes in C's negative emotion (i.e., in the dimension of emotion valence) are observable. Before the intervention, C's anger and sadness were explicitly communicated. After the enactment of surrogate-based management, the negative emotions fade away, followed by C's positive emotions (as indicated by her laughter in Turn 35).

# 7.3 Managing Guilt and Anger (and Sadness) Through Surrogate-based Rapport Management Strategies

Denial is a speech act that does not 'add new information but retracts information', and has been recognized as having 'a clear corrective function' (Spenader and Maier 2009: 1708). Denials can either be explicitly expressed (by negating the prior speaker's utterance with the negative marker 'no'), or implicitly represented (by making a contrasting statement in response to a prior statement) (Geurts & Maier 2013).

# 7.3.1 Pseudo-surrogating Clients and Using Denial Strategies

When denying is expressed on behalf of clients, therapists intend to express what NPTPs say is not true and/or refuse to admit or accept (Ware & Linkugel 1973; Gordon 2011; Benoit 2015). The following extract demonstrates how therapists perform pseudo-surrogacy and use explicit denials to manage disharmony when managing negative emotions.

Extract 7.11 C feels upset when she reports how she is blamed by her long-term collaborative partner for owing him emotional debts.

<table><tr><td>1</td><td>→</td><td>T:看起来你并不欠他的，It looks like you don&#x27;t owe him anything,</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td></td><td>C:啊?Ah?</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>→</td><td>T:看起来你并不欠他的，只不过他不断在向你灌输让你觉得你是低他一等。It seems that you don&#x27;t owe him anything, it is just that he is constantly trying to convince you that you are inferior.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td></td><td>C:他会，他最喜欢说的就是对我这么好，其实如果欠的话，他带我入行，我的人生有了一些变化，可能就是这方面有一些，他和我做的，他也有他的目的，我自己也做了我的那个部分。He would, his favourite talk is he be so nice to me if I had owed him, he brought me into this industry, and there were some changes in my life, and maybe there was a change in that, and he did it with me, and he had a purpose, and I did my part.</td></tr></table>

5 T: 你的人生有变化，是谁的功劳？为什么不是你自己的功劳，而是他的功劳？

There has been a change in your life, whose credit, is it? Why is it not your credit, but his credit?

There has been a change in your life, whose credit, is it? Why is it not your credit, but his credit?

C：嗯，我感觉就是他他-引领了一些，其实还是我自己=

Mm, I feel like he has led some, it's actually up to my own=

T: =比如说有一天我们之间的工作有了一定起色，嗯，获得一些成长，你是否也会说那也是我的功劳？

= For example, one day our work has improved, mm, to get some growth, will you also say that it is also my credit?

8 C: 我会想你给我很大帮助。

I would think you were very helpful to me.

9 T：那不是你应得的吗？因为你付了钱嘛！或者如果你自己不

用一些机会找到这里，或者自己去做那个努力，不做一些努力，也不会有那个成长。实际上我们好像挺忽视自己的功劳的。

Don't you deserve that? Because you have paid for it! Or if you don't grasp some opportunities to come here, or do that yourself, without some effort, there will be no growth. We seem to neglect our credit.

10 C: 好像是，嗯。

It seems to be, mm.

11 T: 好像在内心中我们没真正认可过自己，我们一心希望有个更有能力的人在前面带领我们。

It seems that in our hearts we have never really acknowledged ourselves, and we wholeheartedly hope to have a more capable person leading us forward.

12 C:°是。

Yes.

In the extract mentioned above, C perceives herself as owing the long-term collaborative partner emotional debts. This ganqing violation behaviour negatively influences the rapport between them, evoking C's guilt, anger, and sadness. To manage negative emotions, T serves as a pseudo-surrogate of C and speaks on her behalf. The utterance 'you don't owe him anything' (Turn 3) can be viewed as a response towards C's collaborative partner. When pseudo-surrogating clients, the denial strategy is also employed. In Turn 1, T initiates a 'metalinguistic denial' (Horn 1985: 121), which is linguistically realized in the negative sentence, to 'remove previously introduced material from the common ground' (van der Sandt 1991: 1). In so doing, T intends to protect C's self-image. In Turn 2, the interjection ab, being articulated in the rising pitch, is used by C to initiate repair (Ohala 1984; Gussenhoven 2004). In the next turn (Turn 3), T initiates repair by repeating what he uttered previously and adding some extra information. C ratifies T's utterance by providing further disclosure (Pawelczyk 2011: 192) in the following turn.

The sequence continues with T's further intervention. By using rhetorical questions with the illocutionary force of negation (Turn 5), T challenges C's belief and denies that C owes the collaborative partner something. In Turn 6, C responds by adopting T's perspective and recognizing her effort

in her progress ('it's actually up to my own', Turn 6). In another turn, C shows agreement with T's argument by delivering a mitigated agreement and acknowledgement token mm (Turn 10).

In sum, T speaks on behalf of C denies C's reciprocal obligation to the NPTP, and releases her from the accusations. T's intervention brings changes in C's emotional status. (1) Concerning sadness: C talks in a normal pitched voice (Turn 6, 8, 10), compared with her crying sound when she discloses an interaction with the collaborative partner before this extract. (2) Concerning guilt: C recognizes her efforts in growing up and at the same time denies owing the collaborative partner emotional debts. Both of which would help C generate a new 'relational meaning' and 'emotional evaluation' towards herself (Langlotz & Locher 2012: 1603).

In addition to explicit denials, therapists also use implicit denial—making contrastive statements concerning the prior one (Geurts & Maier 2013; Ho 2019) when managing the discordant rapport. The following is an example.

Extract 7.12 Sadness and shame occur when C discloses an interaction with her father. [When C gave her father a birthday gift, she was told by her father that he didn't need anything and that nothing was useful. She felt that she didn't care about him, otherwise, she should know what he needed. Also, C's father accused C of being unfilial and not understanding his real needs.]

1 T：想起我家里哦……(咨询师讲述自己的母亲如何拉拢他们兄弟两个和他的爸爸对抗，以确立自己在家里的位置)。现在呢，我不想和妈妈太亲近，想从她的管控中挣脱出来。可能和爸爸以前太疏远了。现在当我想和爸爸亲近时，妈妈会感到孤立，就会闹腾。结果就是你离开了妈妈，也离开了爸爸，他们俩就是越来越亲密，有老来伴的感觉。

Think of my family... ((T tells how his mother won over T and T's brother and fought against his father to establish her position in the family)). Now, I don't want to be too close to my mother and want to get out of her control. Maybe I was too estranged from my father before. Now when I want to be close to my father, my mother will feel isolated and lose her temper. As a result, I leave my mother and my father. They are getting closer and closer, and they feel like old friends.

2 C: 呵呵。 Interesting.

T：我妈发现，之前她有俩孩子，而且都听她的话。现在就只能依靠那个男人。结果就是孩子成为替罪羊了，他俩开始抱团了。我觉得这没什么伤心的，这正是我想要的。

My mother found that she had two children before, and they all listened to her. Now she can only rely on my father. As a result, the child became the scapegoat, and they began to get together. I don't think it's sad. This is what I want.

4 C: 呵呵，这样也会觉得轻松。Interesting, you will also feel relaxed.

5 T：我妈妈也会做像你爸爸那样的事情，比如你给她买什么东西啊，她也不觉得怎么受用，就觉得怎么做都不对。其实不是怎么做都不对，其实是因为他们想让我们做的事情我们没有做。是他们一种很强大的控制力，好像做这些才开心，其他的做太多也不领情。

My mother does similar things as your father, for example, if I buy something for her, she doesn't think it's helpful, and she thinks it's wrong to do anything. It's not that whatever you do is wrong. It's because we don't do what they expect us to do. It's because of their powerful control. It seems that only by doing what they expect, can they be happy.

6 C: 对…Yes…

T：我们现在背上这样的骂名也是必然的哦。不让他们满意，我们就一定会是被他们指责的哦。可我觉得这种感觉很有指导作用，让我们看清楚他们的行为是什么。

It is inevitable for us to bear such a bad name now. If we do not satisfy them, we will be criticized by them. But I think this feeling is very guiding, allowing us to see clearly what their behaviour is.

8 C: 可是如果说，当我知道这个以后，我可以怎么办？

But if I know this, what can I do?

9 T：我想-可能就是在一定程度上原谅自己……

I think - maybe to some extent...

10 T: 后来我渐渐发现是这样的，如果你对他们特别孝顺的话，比如我一味满足我妈妈意愿的话，他们夫妻感情还会不好的，我也成了一个妈宝男。最后你也会害了妈妈，也害了自己，也害了爸爸。

I gradually realized that if I am very filial to them, for example, if I blindly satisfy my mother's wishes, the relationship between my father and my mother will not be good, and I will become a mummy's boy. Finally, I will harm my mother, my father and myself.

11 C: 对。

Yes.

12 T：对于妈妈而言，可能是痛苦的，但也是成长的。现在无论他们说我是不孝顺什么的，我会觉得很忍辱负重，做了一件伟大的事情。

It may be painful for your mother, but it also brings her growth. However they criticize me for not being filial, I'll feel like I've put up with it a lot, and I'll feel like I've done a great thing.

In this extract, it is C's perception of not fulfilling the filial obligation that has negatively influenced the rapport she has with her father, triggering her negative emotions (guilt and anger at her father). To manage these negative emotions, implicit denial strategies are employed.

First, T serves as the pseudo-surrogate of C (as shown by the use of the inclusive 'we' pronoun) and excuses C from blaming by appealing to 'the misdeeds of another person as a frame for reference for the evaluation of the failure event' (Schönbach 1980: 197). To start with, T discloses an experience similar to C's. By using the narratives or the 'stored account' (Antaki 1988), T intends to indicate that the children are not filial, but the parents have strong control over the children (Turn 5).

Second, T justifies C's unfilial behaviour by appealing to its positive consequence (McLaughlin et al. 1983). He supports his argument by talking about his interaction with his mother. T doesn't obey his mother's wishes and is considered as not filial, however, this failed event has its positive effects—making the relationship between parents closer ('they are getting closer and closer', Turn 1).

Upon hearing T's argument, C shows agreement by making an utterance relevant to the prior one (Davidson 2002) (Turn 4). On this basis, T accounts for the child's seemingly unfilial behaviour by appealing to the misdeeds of the NPTP (Turn 5). C ratifies it with the acknowledgement token 'yes' and by providing further disclosure (Turn 6).

By appealing to the 'positive consequence of the failure event' (Schönbach 1980: 197; Antaki 1988) and the misdeeds of another person in the analysis of the failure event, the obligation-omission behaviour can be reinterpreted. That is, C has done whatever she could do to fulfil her filial obligations. Moreover, these behaviours have positive consequences for her parents. C's affiliative response and the embodiment of positive emotions (i.e., laughter in Turn 2 and Turn 4) show the accounts are honoured by C and it functions to manage C's sadness. Moreover, C's ratification with T's argument implies she has released herself from self-accusation and attributes new emotional evaluations towards herself (Kessler et al. 2010).

# 7.3.2 the Combined Strategy

When therapists are confronted with clients' guilt and anger triggered by clients' interaction with their parents, the combined strategy is adopted.

Extract 7.13 C feels guilty when she discloses the interaction with her parents. She is blamed by her parents as inattentive.

1 T: 可是我们内心也是很脆弱的，承受不了这样的指责，这样的罪名。其实在我们的肩上，其实还-是扛了很多东西，你有没有觉得自己扛得很沉？But we are also very fragile, we cannot withstand such accusations, such charges. In fact, on our shoulders, in fact also -we have carried a lot of things, do you feel that you have carried very heavy things?

2 C: 有时候觉得那啥-自己肩上扛的东西太多了。 Sometimes I feel I have too much on my shoulders.

3 T: 要把自己压垮。可是又不能垮。有什么原因让我们不能垮？
4 Might crush ourselves. But we can't break down. Why? (2.0).

5 T: 如果真的死掉了呢，一了百了呢，会有什么？这个世界有什么让我们留恋的，让我们放不下的东西？If it died, what would happen if it were all over? What makes us linger in this world? What keeps us from letting go?

6 C: 我现在就是觉得，我不知道对于我未来的，就是不知道我人生的价值和意义到底在哪里？

Now I just feel that I don't know my future, just don't know the value and meaning of my life, where do they exactly exist?

Now I just feel that I don't know my future, just don't know the value and meaning of my life, where do they exactly exist?

7 T: 有担心如果自己真的死了以后，父母= Have you ever worried about your parents when you die, your parents=

8 C: =我有想过。

= I've thought about it.

9 T: 他们可能也很难活下去，作为他们唯一的孩子死掉了话，他们可能也真的没有力量活下去。即使你爸爸那么说，死也死在部队里，但是你可能心里会想，如果真死了的话，这种打击对他来说，也是受不了的啊，也是要他命的哦。

If your parents' only child dies, they may hard to live, and they may not have the strength to live. Even if your father says that, if you die, you must die in the army, you may think, if you were dead, this kind of blow is unbearable to him, and it will kill him.

10 C: 嗯。

Mm.

11 T: 就是虽然他们是那么的可恨，但是你不想要他们的命。就是为了他们，你要努力地活下去。哪怕他们对我们的关心不够，也会把很多压力、责任归到我们身上，但是真正这些责任-我们不扛的时候，他们反倒也活不下去哦= Even though they are hateful, you don't want their lives. Just for them, you have to work hard to survive. Even if they do not care enough about us, they will put a lot of pressure, and responsibility on us, but when we don't carry these responsibilities, they can't live =

12 C: =嗯。

$= \mathrm{Mm}$

13 T: 有时候会不会觉得其实是在为他们而活着，即使自己想放弃，也不允许，也不能放弃。不管怎么说，还是爱着父母的哦，并没有说要想把他们，通过让自己不活了，让自己去死了，让这种方式，去惩罚他们哦。有的时候那种憋屈，那种压在心里的那种憋屈的东西，发不出去。其实我们也是在保护他们，保护他们，好像他们也挺脆弱的，他们也受不了我们的这种指责，你能感觉到他们的脆弱吗，感觉不到？只是觉得自己挺脆弱的哦。

Sometimes you think that you are living for them, even if you want to give up, but we cannot give up. Anyway, we still love our parents, we don't punish them by ending ourselves. Sometimes this kind of oppression, that kind of oppressed thing in our heart, cannot be released. We are protecting them, protecting them. It seems that they are also very vulnerable. They can't bear our accusations. Can you feel their vulnerability. Can't you feel it? Just feel we are vulnerable.

14 C: 嗯。我以前可能很少想到-这些。

Mm. I probably didn't think about these before.

15 T：当时可能也顾不了那么多了啊，压得太难受了。

I could not have taken care of that much at that time, the pressure was too oppressive.

16 C: 是啊, 就是以前的时候……(进一步的讲述))

Yeah, that's when... ((providing further self-disclosure))

In the above interaction, C's guilt and anger toward her parents are evoked by the unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport, and C's filial obligation omission behaviour is the cause of that disharmony. When managing C's negative emotions, T acts as C in a 'pseudo' way and uses implicit denial strategies (i.e., asserting C's fulfilment of the filial obligation to the parents). Such an intervention is achieved step by step.

To start with, the pre-sequences (i.e., questions asked by T) are constructed to establish a common ground on which both parties can align and prepare for T's further delivery of information. By asking questions (Turn 1, 3, 5, 7), T asks C to talk about why she persists though she feels very tired and depressed. The questions are designed to elicit the preferred answers from C. When T doesn't receive the desired answer, two  $wh$ -questions (Turn 5), and a yes-no question with a hint answer (hinting C to consider from the perspective of parents, Turn 7), are initiated. In so doing, T aims to elicit a preferred response from C (Koshik 2005: 101). Additionally, when T constructs shared knowledge between him and C, the inclusive 'we' pronoun is adopted, showing how T pseudo-surrogates C and speaks on her behalf (Mazer et al. 2014).

T's surrogate role is further reflected in the later turns. In addition to using the inclusive 'we' pronoun when commenting on C's behaviour, T speaks as if he were C, as reflected in the utterance 'even if we want to give up, but we cannot give up. In any case, we still love our parents' (Turn 13). Also, T asserts C's fulfilment of the filial obligation on her behalf. Specifically, C is asserted as a person who strives for life for the sake of her parents ('just for them, you have to work hard to survive'), a person who loves her parents ('we still love our parents'), a person who is always protecting her parents ('we are protecting them, protecting them'). With these arguments, C is positioned as a person who has fulfilled the filial obligations: to show affection and concern to her parents, and to take the responsibility of protecting the parents (Lai 2006; Hwang 1987, 1999).

Besides pseudo-surrogating C and using a denial strategy, T simultaneously surrogates C's parents and employs an accounting strategy. In Turn 13, T describes C's parents' situation and feelings (Mazer et al. 2014: 39) ('it seems that they are also very vulnerable'). In this way, T accounts for the parent's inappropriate behaviour.

As for C's response, she confirms T's argument minimally (mm, Turn 14 and 16) and shows her acceptance by producing an utterance relevant to the prior one (Davidson 2002) ('I probably didn't think about these before'). Later, C gives further self-disclosure on what she has done for the parents. This points to C's new understanding of herself (i.e., she is a filial child) and new emotional evaluations towards herself (i.e., compared with the emotional evaluation of guilt before the therapist's intervention).

Extract 7.14 C is a young man who is always blamed by his mother as inattentive to the well-being of his parents and the family.

1 T：你说母亲为什么会说那样的话，她真是那么想的吗？她总是反复唠叨这个话，她能够得到什么东西，能够满足她什么需求？

Can you explain why mother says that? Is that really what she thinks? She always keeps repeating this sentence, what can she get and what kind of her needs can be met?

2 C: 以前没想。现在想她不能承担自己的痛苦，而要把这种痛苦给别人，°都是你干的，或者是( )°

I haven't thought about that before. Now I think that's because she can't bear her pain and wants to give it to others, or all is done by you, or ( )°

3 T: 所以就是一个控制人非常好的方式。在人的内心中下了一个蛊一样，只要念咒语，就可以任意摆布。她就是在我们心里下蛊了，内疚感就像一个虫子在我们心里翻腾。她只要一念咒，我们就开始疼。

So, it's a very good way to control people. Just like having placed a legendary venomous insect in our hearts, if she says the mantra, then we are controlled by her. She has placed that kind of insect in our hearts, the feeling of guilt is like a worm that writhes in our hearts. If she says the mantra, we hurt.

4 C: 一遇到这些事情，就对我起作用了。

As soon as these things happen, they will affect me.

5 T: 嗯。

Mm.

6 C: 现在我做啥事前儿，我都会想，她会不会同意，我现在成为她的傀儡(她的思想了)()((叹气))。

Whatever I do now, I think about whether she would agree  $^\circ$  I am now her puppet (her thoughts) ((sighing))

T: 其实她之所以能够控制我们，也是我们心疼她哦。因为无论怎样，在我们内心中我们都希望她过得好，我们希望能够帮她分担她的难受。她之所以这样，也可能是她确实过得不太好，我们不想再让她雪上加霜。似乎我们迁就，迎合顺从她，她能够开心一点的话，我们宁可遭这个罪。似乎今天遭的罪都是让她开心，让她满意哦。

The reason why she can control us is because we love her. Because whatever it is, deep down, we all hope that she has a good life, we hope to share her pain. The reason why she is like this may also be that she has led a bad life. We don't want to make it even worse for her. It seems that we accommodate and obey her, and if she can be happy, we would rather suffer this. It seems like all we've suffered today is to make her happy, to satisfy her.

8 C: 但是()

°But( )°

9 T: 这也是我们-我们实际上一直在迁就顾虑她的感受，但是我们的感受从来没有人顾虑，这就很苦闷哦！

This is also us - we have been accommodating and worrying about her feelings, but our feelings have never been concerned, which is very depressing!

10 C: 嗯。

Mm.

In this extract, the filial obligation-omission behaviour threatens the rapport between C and his mother, triggering C's self-conscious emotion (guilt) and other-condemning emotion(anger). T uses surrogate-based denial strategies to manage these negative emotions. Specifically, T addresses C's mother directly as 'mother' rather than 'your mother' ('Can you explain why mother says that', Turn 1). The denial strategy is achieved over a series of turns.

First, T establishes shared knowledge with C that his mother intentionally blamers her son, but not necessarily the fact that C fails to fulfil his filial obligation. By asking an affirmative question ('she always keeps repeating this sentence, what can she get and what needs can she meet?', Turn 1), T implies that C's mother intends to blame her son, not necessarily that he fails to fulfil his responsibility to take care of his family. In the next turn, C provides a relevant answer, showing his ratification of the prior utterance (Davidson 2002). Then, T initiates a 'so'-prefaced utterance, building his comments as an extension of C's Turn (Turn 8). C acknowledges T's argument by providing further disclosure (Pawelczyk 2011) in the next turn. C's acknowledgement indicates the establishment of mutual understanding between the two parties—though C is always blamed by his mother for not fulfilling the filial obligation, this is not necessarily the case. His mother has her underlying reasons for complaining about him.

In the following turns, T asserts that C has fulfilled his filial obligations to his parents. C is positioned as a son who cares about his mother ('the reason why she can control us is because we love her', Turn 7); a son who always tries to please his mother, even when he is suffering, and who is always obedient to his parent. In Turn 17, C ratifies T's argument by using the acknowledgement tokens and building his utterance as an extension of the prior utterance (Vehviläinen 2008: 130).

The enactment of surrogate-based rapport management has witnessed changes in C's emotional status. His acceptance and acknowledgement of his effort in caring about her mother (Turn 12, Turn 10) implicate new relational meaning and emotional evaluations. That is, he could be released from the guilt he held before the intervention (Langlotz and Locher 2012;

Kessler et al. 2010). By analyzing this extract, the client's negative emotions (guilt and anger towards NPTPs), which have been created by a threat to rapport because of ganqing obligation-omission behaviour, can be managed by employing the denial strategies and the accounting strategies, both of which are based on the respective surrogate roles performed by T.

# 7.4 Conclusion

This chapter lays out how therapists use surrogate-based rapport management strategies to manage clients' negative emotions (cf. Figure 7.1).

Figure 7.1 Surrogate-based rapport management strategies for managing negative emotions.

Anger/anger and sadness are managed by three types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies: (1) surrogating NPTPs and using the accounting strategies; (2) pseudo-surrogating clients and using the aggressive strategies; and (3) the combined strategy (pseudo-surrogating clients and surrogating NPTPs respectively, whilst using the aggressive strategy and the accounting strategy respectively).

Guilt and anger (and sadness) are managed by two types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies: (1) pseudo-surrogating clients and using the denial strategies; and (2) the combined strategy (pseudo-surrogating clients and surrogating NPTPs respectively, whilst using the denial strategy and the accounting strategy respectively).

To facilitate the discussions to be proceeded in Chapter 8, 'surrogating NPTPs and using accounting strategies' is shortly expressed as 'surrogate-based accounting strategies'; 'pseudo-surrogating clients and using aggressive strategies' is shortly expressed as 'surrogate-based aggressive strategies', and 'pseudo-surrogating clients and using denial strategies' is shortly expressed as 'surrogate-based denial strategies'.

Considering the surrogate-based rapport management strategies in terms of the relationship type between clients and NPTPs, it is found that: (1) the accounting strategies are mainly found in therapists' management of clients' negative emotions caused by an interaction with their parents, or couples; it is also found in clients' interactions with close friends; (2) the aggressive strategies are mainly found in therapists' management of clients' negative emotions caused by an interaction with a long-term collaborative partner or parents; (3) the denial strategies are mainly found in therapists' management of clients' negative emotions caused by interactions with parents and with long-term collaborative partners; (4) the combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs successively and using aggressiveaccounting strategies) is found to be used in therapists' management of clients' negative emotions caused by interactions with parents and with long-term collaborative partners; and (5) the combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs and using denial and accounting strategies) is mainly found in therapists' management of clients' negative emotions caused by interactions with parents.

Regarding the effect of therapists' intervention (i.e., surrogate-based rapport management) on clients' negative emotions, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) much of the intervention has witnessed the reduction of clients' anger/sadness. For instance, a reduction of intensity (cf. Extract 7-1; Extract 7-3), or a reduction of intensity and the change of valence (i.e., from negative to positive) (cf. Extract 7-2; Extract 7-4), or a reducing in intensity and persistence, as in Extract 7-5; Extract 7-6; Extract 7-9; Extract 7-10; Extract 7-11; Extract 7-12. (2) The majority of the intervention has witnessed the reduction of clients' shame/guilt

(cf. Extract 7-11 to 6-14). (3) The effect of the intervention can also be reflected in the enhancement of clients' anger and sadness, for instance, as in Extract 7-13, and Extract 7-14. The analysis shows how emotion management practices function to maintain and enhance emotional status, which is also a type of emotion management (Thompson 1994: 28). This argument can also be justified by the post-interview data. When therapists are asked to comment on the ways to observe the effect of their efforts in managing negative emotions, one of the therapists notes as follows:

In the beginning, clients' emotions are trapped. But later, he may make some associations, and he may think about the parents, this is a kind of progress. At first, the mind is exhausted, and static, while later, in the mind there is association, description, his emotion shows, this is a positive change.

(From therapist 1)

Additionally, the comments from therapists also show their effort in managing perceptions of relationships when they are confronted with clients' negative emotions.

The clients tend to be rigid and inflexible in their thinking. Emotional expression is related to cognitive expression. The consultation process is about presenting clients with a new perspective on the problem, such as a new perspective to think about the relationship, or a perspective to look at themselves in the relationship. [italics are added]

(From therapist 3)

These people tend to be negative, so in the counselling process, I sometimes guide them to look at relationships and things more positively. This process is more about leading them to think, and following them in the process, rather than imposing opinions on them.

(From therapist 2)

# 8 Accounting for Negative Emotion Management Through Rapport Management Strategies

# 8.1 Introduction

In Chapter 6, the types of negative emotions clients display when they disclose ganqing violation-induced discordant rapport (hereafter GQVI discordant rapport) are discussed. In Chapter 7, different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies employed by therapists to manage negative emotions are examined. The question thus becomes: why do therapists deploy different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies to manage negative emotions? Is there any factor that influences therapists' choice of surrogate-based rapport management strategies? A close analysis of different types of strategies finds that they can be categorized into three major types: (1) discordant rapport-challenge orientated strategies; (2) discordant rapport-maintenance orientated strategies; and (3) discordant rapport-neglect orientated strategies. Based on this categorization, the chapter focuses on the factor that influences therapists' choice of strategies.

# 8.2 Recategorizing Surrogate-based Rapport Management Strategies Concerning Rapport Orientations

Since the rapport orientations in Spencer-Oatey's RMF concern the harmonious relations between interlocutors and that there are also the disharmonious relations to deal with under some circumstances, together with the viewpoint that 'one can promote, maintain, or threaten both harmonious or discordant relationships' (Lauriks et al. 2015: 24), this study thus contends that the speakers can hold any of the following types of discordant rapport orientations when it is in their best interest to do so. In Table 8.1, 'Ts' refers to therapists, 'Cs' refers to clients, and 'NPTPs' refers to non-present third parties.

Based on the rapport orientations proposed above, surrogate-based rapport management strategies can be re-categorized concerning rapport orientations.

Table 8.1 Three types of discordant rapport orientations

<table><tr><td>Discordant rapport orientation1</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Discordant rapport challenge</td><td>Ts attempt to challenge the disharmony that exists between Cs and NPTPs. Ts say something advantageous for the relationship between Cs and NPTPs (e.g., account for NPTPs&#x27; lack of feelings when interacting with Cs and thus account for NPTPs&#x27; ganqing violation behaviour)</td></tr><tr><td>Discordant rapport neglect</td><td>Ts are indifferent to the quality of the relationship between Cs and NPTPs (e.g., because of a focus on Cs&#x27;s self-images)</td></tr><tr><td>Discordant rapport maintenance</td><td>Ts utter something that aims to maintain the current quality of the relationship and level of disharmony between Cs and NPTPs (e.g., criticizing NPTPs&#x27; ganqing behaviour)</td></tr></table>

<sup>1</sup> The proposal of 'discordant rapport orientation' is based on (1) Lauriks et al. (2015) notion of 'discordant rapport' and the relevant discussions on the management of discordant rapport; and (2) Spencer-Oatey's (2008: 31-33) argument on rapport orientations. Moreover, four types of rapport orientations are discussed in Spencer-Oatey's framework; this study lists three relevant types given the research focus.

(1) Surrogate-based accounting strategies are discordant rapport-challenge orientated. As laid out in Chapter 7, surrogate-based accounting strategies are the major practices adopted by therapists when they are confronted with clients' anger/anger and sadness. Taking the triggers of these negative emotions into consideration, this type of strategy is used to manage negative emotions caused by unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport.

When implementing surrogate-based accounting strategies, therapists speak for or on behalf of NPTPs (Coupland & Coupland 2001; Halkowski 2011; Mazer et al. 2014; Fioramonte & Vásquez 2019) and help them to deny full responsibility (Austin 1961; Goffman 1971; Buttny 1993) for their gan- qing violation behaviour. The surrogate-based accounting strategies function to 'bridge the gap between action and expectations' (Scott & Lyman 1968: 46). The success of an account is evaluated in terms of whether it is accepted or acknowledged by the offended party (Blumstein et al. 1974; Read 1992). The acceptance of an excuse indicates the restoration of the social order or 'ritual equilibrium' (Goffman 1971: 171-202). Drawing on the discursive approach, clients' acceptance of the accounts offered by therapists they do on behalf of NPTPs) is observable, as displayed through their ratification of therapists' utterances in the next turns.

To sum up, the surrogate-based accounting strategies challenge the discordant relationship between clients and NPTPs and restore the harmonious relations between the two parties (Lauriks et al. 2015). That is, the surrogate-based accounting strategies are discordant rapport-challenge orientated.

(2) Surrogate-based aggressive strategies are discordant rapport-maintenance orientated. Apart from surrogate-based accounting strategies, surrogate-based aggressive strategies are also deployed to manage clients' negative emotions caused by unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport. Rather than taking the surrogate roles and speaking for/on behalf of clients, therapists pseudo-surrogate clients and adopt a common position as clients (Hasselkus 1992; Coupland & Coupland 2001), resulting in NPTPs being complained about.

Criticizing NPTPs' ganqing violation behaviour, accusing NPTPs' of ganqing violation behaviour, and abusing NPTPs' ganqing violation behaviour are three commonly used aggressive strategies. By employing these strategies, therapists highlight or emphasize NPTPs' inappropriate behaviour and the infringement of clients' association rights, thereby maintaining the current quality of the relationship and the level of disharmony between clients and NPTPs.

(3) A combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs successively and using aggressive accounting strategies) is discordant rapport-challenge orientated. Under some circumstances, therapists first pseudo-surrogate clients and adopt aggressive strategies. If this strategy is not effective, therapists would then surrogate NPTPs and adopt the accounting strategies. Therapists take a discordant rapport maintenance orientation at first; however, they challenge the disharmonious relations between the two parties afterwards. Thus, the combined strategy can be understood as discordant rapport-challenge orientated.

(4) Surrogate-based denial strategies are discordant rapport-neglect orientated. This type of strategy differs from the two strategies mentioned above because it is used to manage negative emotions caused by unfulfilled ganqing obligation-induced discordant rapport. When enacting this type of strategy, therapists pseudo-surrogate clients and use explicit denials (e.g., negating clients' obligation to reciprocate) or implicit denials (e.g., asserting clients' fulfilment of reciprocal obligations). During this process, therapists are concerned little about the quality of the relationship between clients and NPTPs but pay great attention to clients' self-images. Because of NPTPs' accusations, for instance, clients are blamed for caring little about their parents, who fail to reciprocate the favour from friends, etc. Surrogate-based denial

strategies function to change clients' prior perception about themselves or reduce their responsibility for the failure event. Clients' responses in the next turns indicate the acceptance of the therapists' utterances and the recovery of the damaged self-images. To sum up, then, surrogate-based denial strategies lack concern or interest in the disharmonious relations between clients and NPTPs. This means they are discordant rapport-neglect orientated.

(5) The combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs and using denial and accounting strategies) is discordant rapport-challenge orientated. Occasionally, therapists pseudo-surrogate clients and use denial strategies. Moreover, they speak for NPTPs and use excuses or justifications to account for NPTPs' ganqing violation behaviour.

In so doing, therapists bridge the gap between what has been expected and the actual behaviour. Specifically, the denial strategy bridges the gap between the NPTP's expectations concerning the relational principle of ganqing and the behaviour, while the accounting strategy bridges the gap between clients' expectation according to the relational principle of ganqing and NPTPs' behaviour. Understanding it from this perspective, the combined strategy is discordant rapport-challenge orientated. Different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies that are used to manage clients' negative emotions are presented in Table 8.2.

# 8.3 Variation in Surrogate-based Rapport Management in Terms of Social Distance

People's perceptions of social distance/relational intimacy/familiarity vary from one to another (Holmes 1990; Holtgraves 1992). For instance,

Table 8.2 Surrogate-based rapport management strategies in terms of rapport orientations

<table><tr><td>Rapport orientations</td><td>Surrogate-based rapport management strategies</td></tr><tr><td>Discordant rapport-challenge orientated</td><td>• Surrogate-based accounting strategies
• The combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs successively and using aggressive accounting strategies)
• The combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs and using denial and accounting strategies)</td></tr><tr><td>Discordant rapport-maintenance orientated</td><td>• Surrogate-based aggressive strategies</td></tr><tr><td>Discordant rapport-neglect orientated</td><td>• Surrogate-based denial strategies</td></tr></table>

Blum-Kulka et al. (1985: 123) claim that the relationship between 'members of a nuclear family' (e.g., parent-child or between couples) is located at the 'high' end of the social distance continuum, while the relationship between 'friends and non-nuclear kin' is located at the 'medium' end of the social distance continuum. Similarly, Holmes (1990) classifies the relationship between spouses and family members as close and the relationship between distant acquaintances as distant, while the social relations between friends and colleagues are located between the 'close' and 'distant' ends.

This study, inspired by Blum-Kulka et al. (1985) and Holmes (1990), distinguishes two types of relative social distance (italics added) between clients and the NPTP: (1) a higher degree of intimacy, which involves the relationship between a child and a parent, and within couples; and (2) a lower degree of intimacy, which involves the relationship between close friends (e.g., boyfriend-girlfriend; between bosom friends) and long-term collaborative partners. Based on these, the relative social distance between clients and NPTPs is laid out in Figure 8.1.

Second, as mentioned in Chapter 5, altogether 30 extracts that concern emotion management through managing GQVI discordant rapport have been identified. This section starts with a description of surrogate-based rapport management strategies employed by therapists to manage clients' negative emotions.

In Table 8.3, the types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies, and the distribution of strategies in terms of relationship dyads (clients' relationship with NPTPs is featured as a child-parent dyad or wife-husband dyad), are laid out. The relationship dyads, include: (1) parent-child; (2) husband-wife; (3) bosom friends; (4) boyfriend-girlfriend; and (5) long-term collaborative partners. Though these five types of relationship dyads are different, they are featured as long-standing and intimate in Chinese interpersonal communication (Gao & Ting-Toomey 1998; Zhu 2015). Accordingly, the relational principle of ganqing underpins the interaction between these relationship dyads (Yang 1994; Chang 2013, 2018).

<table><tr><td rowspan="3">Types of strategies</td><td colspan="5">Distribution of strategies in terms of relationship dyad</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Direct family members</td><td colspan="3">Friends and collaborative partners</td></tr><tr><td>Child-parent</td><td>Husband-wife</td><td>Between bosom friends</td><td>Boyfriend-girlfriend</td><td>Long-term collaborative partners</td></tr><tr><td>Surrogate-based accounting strategies</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Surrogate-based aggressive strategies</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>The combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs successively and using aggressive accounting strategies)</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Surrogate-based denial strategies</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>The combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs and using denial and accounting strategies)</td><td>3</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

# 8.3.1 Higher Degree of Intimacy: Discordant Rapport-challenge Orientated Strategies

As shown in Figure 8.1, when clients' relationships with NPTPs feature a higher degree of intimacy—meaning that it is clients' interactions with their parents or their romantic partners that have triggered their negative emotions (anger, anger, and sadness, guilt, and anger)—it is much more likely that therapists will adopt discordant rapport-challenge orientated strategies (amounting to  $73\%$ ). Surrogate-based accounting strategies cover  $47\%$ , the combined strategy (serving two surrogate roles and using aggressive accounting strategies) amounts to  $6.7\%$ , and the combined strategy (serving two different surrogate roles and using denial and accounting strategies) covers  $20\%$ . Moreover, discordant rapport-maintenance orientated strategies cover  $20\%$  and discordant rapport-neglect orientated strategies cover  $7\%$ . Based on this, it tentatively concluded that if clients' interactions with NPTPs are characterized as having a higher degree of intimacy, it is more likely that therapists will employ discordant rapport-challenge orientated strategies to manage clients' negative emotions.

# 8.3.2 Lower Degree of Intimacy: Discordant Rapport-maintenance Orientated Strategies

According to Table 8.1, when clients' relationships with NPTPs are characterized as having a lower degree of intimacy—for instance, if it is the client's interaction with her boyfriend that has evoked her negative emotions—it is much more likely that the therapist will adopt discordant rapport-maintenance orientated strategies (amounting to  $53\%$ ). Further, the discordant rapport-neglect orientated strategies cover  $14\%$ , and the discordant rapport-challenge orientated strategies amount to  $33\%$ . One possible explanation for therapists' deployment of discordant rapport-challenge orientated strategies in this relationship dyad is that for good friends who have known each other for a long time and who become very close, people consider them as 'members of the family' (Peng you ru jia ren) (Gao and Ting-Toomey 1998: 14).

If clients' interactions with NPTPs are characterized as having a lower degree of intimacy (e.g., between long-term collaborative partners, or between boyfriend and girlfriend), it is more likely that therapists will deploy discordant rapport-maintenance orientated strategies to manage clients' negative emotions. Based on what has been discussed in Section 8.3, Figure 8.2 is drawn to show the influence of social distance on therapists' choice of surrogate-based rapport management strategies when managing clients' negative emotions.

Figure 8.2 Influence of social distance (between Cs and NPTPs) on surrogate-based rapport management strategies.

# 8.4 Conclusion

This chapter accounts for therapists' employment of different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies when managing negative emotions. To achieve this, these strategies discussed in the previous chapter are re-categorized according to the rapport orientation each type of strategy falls into. Specifically, (1) surrogate-based accounting strategies and the combined strategy are discordant rapport-challenge orientated; (2) surrogate-based aggressive strategies are discordant rapport-maintenance orientated; (3) surrogate-based denial strategies are discordant rapport-neglect orientated; (4) the combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs successively and using aggressive accounting strategies) is discordant rapport-challenge orientated; and (5) the combined strategy (surrogating clients and NPTPs and using denial and accounting strategies) is discordant rapport-challenge orientated. Then, the statistical data is presented to show the distribution of surrogate-based rapport management strategies in terms of the relationship type.

The underlying factor that influences therapists' choice of different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies in managing negative emotions has been identified. The social distance between clients and NPTPs is a key factor that mandates the language use of therapists. On the one hand, if clients' relationships with NPTPs feature higher intimacy—that is, if clients' negative emotions are caused by clients' interactions with their parents or romantic partners—it is more likely that therapists would employ discordant rapport-challenge orientated strategies, which aim to restore the harmonious relationship between the two parties and then manage clients' negative emotions accordingly. On the other hand, if clients' relationships with NPTPs feature a lower degree of intimacy, it is more likely that therapists will deploy discordant rapport-maintenance orientated strategies. Occasionally (e.g., in the case of negative emotions resulting from the disharmonious interaction clients have with the long-term collaborative partners), discordant rapport-neglect orientated strategies will be adopted.

# 9 Conclusion

# 9.1 Major Research Findings

This study has firstly analyzed the types of negative emotions clients display when they disclose the ganqing violation-induced discordant rapport (hereafter GQVI discordant rapport) that exists between them and NPTPs. Then, the types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies deployed to manage these negative emotions are explored. Thereafter, therapists' reasons for using different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies to manage negative emotions are accounted for.

# 9.1.1 Types of Negative Emotions

When clients disclose the GQVI discordant rapport that exists between them and NTPPs, two major types of negative emotions are displayed:

1 Anger/anger and sadness. This category of negative emotions is displayed when clients disclose the unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport that exists between them and the guanxi members (i.e., NPTPs). The guanxi members' (i.e., clients' parents, couples, close friends, and long-term collaborative partners) lack of feelings towards clients and the guanxi members' emotional detachment from clients are rapport threats, resulting in clients' perceptions of GQVI discordant rapport and evoking clients' anger/anger and sadness.

2 Guilt and anger (and sadness). The category of negative emotions displayed when clients disclose the unfulfilled ganqing obligation-induced discordant rapport that exists between them and the guanxi members (i.e., the client's parent and long-term collaborative partners). Clients' filial obligation omission behaviour and failure to return the emotional debt are the rapport threats, evoking clients' perceptions of GQVI discordant rapport and triggering clients' guilt and anger (and sadness).

When clients display anger and sadness, guilt, and anger (and sadness), they are entangled in 'emotional interactional chains' (Langlotz & Locher 2017: 310). Sadness is evoked by anger, while anger (and sadness) is triggered by guilt. That is to say, unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport tends to evoke anger and anger-related emotions, while unfulfilled ganqing obligation-induced discordant rapport tends to trigger guilt and guilt-related emotions.

# 9.1.2 Expressions of Negative Emotions

The ways that negative emotions are expressed are closely related to their categories. Anger is the type of negative emotion that is most frequently observed, which occurs when clients are disclosing unmet ganqing expectations or unfulfilled ganqing obligations. Anger is displayed verbally through the speech acts of complaints, and prosodically with a high-pitch register. Clients rarely name their anger.

Sadness is expressed when clients talk about the unmet ganqing expectations or unfulfilled ganqing obligations. Similar to anger, sadness is seldom named by clients. Few clients describe their sadness with emotional words such as sad or hurt. More frequently, sadness is displayed vocally and prosodically through crying sounds and sobbing. Clients mainly express guilt by employing emotional description or implication. As for the former, clients describe the wrongful acts and take responsibility, while in the latter case, guilt is implied through lexical connotations or conceptual implications. Occasionally, clients explicitly name guilt.

Concerning the emotional displays, it can be summarized that, to a large extent, clients display their negative emotions implicitly (e.g., through the speech acts of complaints or the implications), which reflects the influence of a high-context communication culture on the emotional expression of Chinese speakers (Hall 1976; Kim et al. 1998). Negative emotions are more frequently indicated and demonstrated than explicitly described.

# 9.1.3 Managing Negative Emotions Through Surrogate-based Rapport Management

Given it is the GQVI discordant rapport between clients and NPTPs that has caused clients' negative emotions, and based also on the premise that people's perception of relational disharmony/harmony is a dynamic construct (Spencer-Oatey 2005; Spencer-Oatey & Franklin 2009), it is therefore maintained that clients' negative emotions can be managed by managing the GQVI discordant rapport between clients and NPTPs. Data analysis finds that therapists employ five types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies to manage clients' negative emotions. Moreover,

Figure 9.1 An integrated model of rapport-orientated negative emotion management.

a rapport-orientated negative emotion management model is proposed to account for the interactive process of emotion management.

Concerning Figure 9.1, the following aspects are worth noting. First, the figure depicts two key stages when therapists manage clients' negative emotions. (1) Stage one (the process as reflected through single lines) illustrates the point that clients' perception of GQVI discordant rapport results in their negative emotions. When therapists are confronted with negative emotions (e.g., anger, anger and sadness) that arise out of the social interaction with NPTPs, they are obliged to take some actions to change the status of interpersonal relations to act upon these negative emotions. Then it comes to (2) stage two (the process as reflected in the double lines). During this stage, therapists pseudo-surrogate clients or surrogate NPTPs

to manage the relational disharmony between clients and NPTPs. Based on respective surrogate roles, different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies are employed to manage the GQVI discordant rapport. The management of relational disharmony between clients and NPTPs acts on clients' negative emotions. Thus, the whole process<sup>1</sup> has witnessed how negative emotions are triggered by GQVI discordant rapport, and how these negative emotions can be managed through managing the discordant rapport. Specifically, the following five types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies are employed by therapists to manage clients' negative emotions.

(1) Surrogate-based accounting strategies. To manage clients' anger at the NPTPs/anger at NPTPs and sadness, both of which are negative emotions caused by unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport, therapists surrogate NPTPs and speak on their behalf. Drawing on such a discourse role (Sarangi 2010), therapists employ accounting strategies to manage the relational disharmony between clients and NPTPs. In terms of linguistic realizations, the accounts are realized through excuses/justifications. For instance, excusing NPTPs' ganqing violation behaviour by appealing to pressure from third parties, by appealing to their need for face maintenance, etc. In so doing, NPTPs' ganqing violation behaviour that has caused the discordant rapport is explained. From clients' responses in the next turns (e.g., the acknowledgement tokens or other ways of showing recognition), it is found that the gap between clients' ganqing expectations and NPTPs' acts is bridged.

(2) Surrogate-based aggressive strategies. To manage clients' anger at the NPTPs/anger at NPTPs and sadness, both types of negative emotions evoked by unmet ganqing expectation-induced discordant rapport, therapists pseudo-surrogate clients and speak as or for them. Aggressive strategies are linguistically realized through criticisms, abuses, or accusations. In this way, the disharmony between clients and NPTPs is maintained. The emotional cues clients display after the intervention (e.g., an increased emotional intensity which is indicated through a higher pitch register and faster tempo) show that surrogate-based aggressive strategies are effective in managing negative emotions.

(3) Surrogate-based denial strategies. To manage clients' guilt and anger at the NPTPs, the types of negative emotions that are caused by unfulfilled ganqing obligation-induced discordant rapport, therapists serve as pseudo-surrogates of clients and speak as or for them. When implementing this type of strategy, therapists show little concern for the relational disharmony between clients and NPTPs but dedicate it to

restoring clients' damaged self-images. From clients' responses in the next turns (e.g., the fading away of negative emotions), it is observable that this type of strategy is effective in managing clients' negative emotions.

(4) The combined strategy<sup>1</sup> (i.e., surrogating clients and NPTPs successively and using aggressiveaccounting strategies). Under some circumstances (e.g., if clients' anger at NPTPs/anger at NPTPs and sadness are very strong), therapists would first serve as pseudo-surrogates of clients and employ aggressive strategies. If the intended effect is not achieved, therapists would surrogate NPTPs and deploy the accounting strategies.

(5) The combined strategy $^2$  (i.e., surrogating clients and NPTPs and using denial and accounting strategies). If clients' guilt and anger at NPTPs are caused by clients' interactions with their parents, it is probable that therapists may serve as two types of surrogate roles simultaneously (i.e., as pseudo-surrogates of clients and surrogates of NPTPs) and adopt denial strategies and accounting strategies. In so doing, therapists on the one hand bridge the gap between what has been expected by NPTPs and what has been done by clients (i.e., by using denial strategies), and on the other bridge the gap between what has been expected by clients and what has performed by NPTPs (i.e., through accounting NPTPs' inappropriate behaviour).

# 9.1.4 Social Distance as a Key Factor Affecting Surrogate-based Rapport Management

Based on the types of negative emotions clients display when they disclose the GQVI discordant rapport between clients and NPTPs, as well as the different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies deployed by therapists to manage these negative emotions, the underlying factor that influences therapists' choice of different types of surrogate-based management strategies need to be further explored.

The question is explored following several steps. First, it is argued that rapport orientation, discordant rapport orientation more specifically, offers a theoretical construct upon which different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies can be systematically categorized. Drawing on Spencer-Oatey's (2000:29-31) research on four types of rapport orientations—namely rapport enhancement orientation, rapport maintenance orientation, rapport challenge orientation, and rapport neglect orientation—and also on the fact it is discordant rapport rather than harmony that therapists are managing, three types of discordant rapport orientation have been put forward: (1) the discordant rapport-maintenance orientation, (2) the discordant rapport-challenge orientation, and (3) the

discordant rapport-neglect orientation. Based on such a theoretical construct, the discordant rapport orientations of the five types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies can be identified.

Then, the analysis moves on to explore how different types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies are distributed concerning the relationship between clients and NPTPs (e.g., a child-parent dyad or wife-husband dyad). Data analysis reveals that the social distance between clients and NPTPs is a key factor that influences therapists' choice of surrogate-based rapport management strategies. (1) If clients' relationships with NPTPs are characterized as having a higher degree of intimacy, or, put in another way, if it is clients' interactions with their parents or with their romantic partners that have evoked their negative emotions, it seems that therapists will deploy discordant rapport-challenge orientated strategies when managing clients' negative emotions. (2) If clients' relationships with NPTPs fall within a lower degree of intimacy—if, for instance, it is clients' interactions with their long-term collaborative partners that have triggered their negative emotions—therapists tend to use discordant maintenance orientated strategies to manage the discordant rapport when managing clients' negative emotions.

Summing up, social distance (whether clients' relationships with NPTPs are characterized as having a higher or lower degree of intimacy) greatly influences a therapist's choice of surrogate-based rapport management when managing clients' negative emotions.

# 9.2 Further Theoretical, Methodological, and Practical Implications

# 9.2.1 Theoretical Implication: a Ganqing Approach to Rapport (management)

An analysis of therapists' management of clients' negative emotions has revealed how GQVI discordant rapport triggers negative emotions, and how rapport management strategies are employed to manage these negative emotions. Unmet ganqing expectations and unfulfilled ganqing obligations have caused disharmony between clients and NTPPs. Unmet ganqing expectations involve a lack of feelings and/or emotional detachment, while unfulfilled ganqing obligations concern the interlocutor's filial obligation omission behaviour, as well as owing emotional debt to others.

By comparing the triggers of rapport threats between clients and NPTPs, I find these threats are different from the infringement of autonomy or benefit and differ from interactional detachment or affective detachment. That is to say, the two fundamental socio-pragmatic interactional principles—the equity principle and the association principle—cannot fully explain interpersonal communication in intimate relationships (e.g., parent-child or close friendships). Against this backdrop, the relational principle of

ganqing, whose components involve affection, concern, mutuality, reciprocity, and relational obligations, can be drawn. Accordingly, a ganqing approach to rapport (management) is proposed.

In sum, ganqing is regarded as a relational principle that influences Chinese people's interactions, and it also a social norm that guides people's interactions with those close to them or who have a long-term relationship with them. Its unique features and the components it emphasizes make it a specific interactional principle that needs to be noticed and highlighted.

# 9.2.2 Theoretical Implication of Ganqing for (im)politeness Theory

Analysis of the ganqing violation induced discordant rapport that has triggered interlocutors' negative emotions and adoption of a ganqing approach has important implications for the understanding of (im)politeness theory in general. First, by exploring ganqing threats in interpersonal disharmony, this study moves beyond the current focus on face threatening as impolite. Face threat has been the core of analysis of conflictive interpersonal interactions over the years. This study, however, reveals that ganqing threats are first and foremost evaluated as threats to interpersonal harmony.

Second, the analysis shows how people's (im) politeness evaluations are influenced by culturally-based expectations. It is widely accepted that (im) politeness evaluation is underpinned by the notion of 'expectation' (e.g., Spencer-Oatey 2005, 2008; Culpeper 2011; Haugh 2015; Kádár & Haugh 2013; Tayebi 2016). For example, Culpeper (2011: 23) defines impoliteness as clashes of 'expectations' when a situated behaviour 'conflicts with how one expects them to be, how one wants them to be and/or how one thinks things ought to be'. Garcés-Conejos Blitivich (2010: 63) defines impoliteness as the disregard for ' (pre) genre-sanctioned, norms and interactional parameters managing the rights and obligations associated therein with a given individual/social identity'. According to Haugh (2015), 'moral expectations' or 'moral order' are closely associated with (im)politeness evaluations. Most of the studies analyze the interlink between expectation and (im)politeness from a general perspective, ignoring cultural variations or emic perspectives (Zhao & Ran 2019). Ganqing is a culturally specific expectation underlying Chinese people's interaction with people from an intimate/close relationship (e.g., child-parent, husband-wife, and between intimate friends), which is different from the expectation that exists between strangers, relatives, neighbours, acquaintances, etc. It also differs from the expectations that have been discussed within the Chinese sociocultural context (e.g., qingmian expectation and renqing expectation).

Third, the study has implications for the relation between emotion and impulsiveness. Prior studies have adopted an outcome-orientated view of

emotion, mainly examining the emotional responses to rapport violations or impulsiveness (Spencer-Oatey 2005, 2008). Some other scholars explore the impact of emotions on impulsiveness evaluations (Langlotz & Locher 2012; Vergis & Terkourafi 2015). Most of these studies focus on the individual's emotional status. However, the study of ganqing threat explores how affection between persons can be threatened and damaged.

# 9.2.3 Surrogate-based Rmf

The research findings discussed in Chapter 9 support the surrogate-based RMF proposed in Chapter 4. Since the surrogate-based RMF is drawn based on Spencer-Oatey's RMF (2000, 2005), Table 8.1 is presented to illustrate the differences between the surrogate-based RMF and the RMF addressed by Spencer-Oatey. In addition to what is displayed in Figure 9.1, two points are worth mentioning. First, surrogate-based rapport management is more applicable to the management of discordant rapport/disharmonious relationships. More concretely, an interlocutor (e.g., interlocutor A) recognizes that there exists a disharmonious relationship between the co-interlocutor (interlocutor B) and the NPTP. The disharmony between B and NPTP can be manifested through the meta/comments he/she makes about the rapport-sensitive issues disclosed by B, and it can also be sequentially displayed in B's responses in the next turns (e.g., acknowledgement tokens, a second assessment that affiliates with A's prior assessment).

Second, the surrogate roles taken by A when he/she manages the discordant rapport between B and NPTP are dependent on the discordant rapport orientation he/she takes, which involves at least three circumstances<sup>2</sup>: (1) if A intends to challenge the disharmonious relationship or to restore relational harmony between B and NPTP, he/she tends to acts as the surrogate of the NPTP and to account for the NPTP's inappropriate behaviour; (2) if A aims to maintain the disharmony between B and the NPTP (if he/she believes it is in A's interest/benefit to do so), A tends to serve as a pseudo-surrogate of B and uses aggressive strategies to abuse or criticize the NPTP's inappropriateness; (3) if A shows little concern about the disharmony between the NPTP and B but focuses on the latter's self-image, he/she may act as a pseudo-surrogate of B and employ denial strategies, or he/she might adopt two surrogate roles simultaneously and use two types of strategies (e.g., denial strategies and accounting strategies). Concerning the underlying factor that influences A's choice of surrogate roles and linguistic strategies, the social distance between B and NPTP is a key one.

Based on what is discussed in this section and laid out in Table 9.1, this study thereby theoretically contributes to rapport management in interpersonal pragmatics by proposing the surrogate-based RMF, which accounts

# 9.2.4 Theoretical Implication: an Integral Relationship Between Interpersonal Emotions and Interpersonal Relations

In terms of the interconnection between interpersonal relations and interpersonal emotions, most of the studies have been examined from an outcome-orientated view, that is, interpersonal emotions are responses to antecedent incidents such as face threat, impulsiveness, or rapport threats (Spencer-Oatey 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011; Culpeper 2011; Langlotz & Locher 2012; Vergis & Terkourafi 2015).

By examining emotion from a process-oriented view, that is, by examining the triggers of interlocutors' negative emotions, by exploring the interactive management of these negative emotions, as well as by referencing the communicative effect of emotion management, an integral interrelationship between interpersonal emotion and interpersonal relation is shown (cf. Figure 9.1). On the one hand, it supports the claim that interpersonal communication is the primary elicitor of most emotions (Andersen & Guerrero 1998). On the other hand, negative emotions are not simply products or residues of the experience of disharmonious interpersonal interaction; rather they are the drivers of the dynamic movement of interpersonal relations, including the maintaining, challenging, ignoring, or neglecting of the status of interpersonal relations.

In sum, such a finding not only offers a lens from which negative emotion can be understood, more importantly, but it also uncovers the pragmatic mechanism through which negative interpersonal emotions can be managed.

# 9.2.5 Methodological Implication: Self-reports as a Useful Site for Interpersonal Pragmatics Research

This study echoes Haugh et al's (2013) views that the self-reports of individuals are useful sites for the analysis of interpersonal relationships as well as interpersonal emotions. The primary site for analyzing interpersonal relationships is the 'relationship achieved through interaction by two or more individuals' (ibid 2013: 5), just like most of the studies that are examined from the interpersonal pragmatics approach (e.g., Arundale 2006, 2010; Norrby et al. 2015; Orthaber & Reiter 2016; Haugh & Sinkeviciute 2018; Ran & Zhao 2018). The reason why self-reports in psychotherapy sessions are suitable for examining interpersonal relations can be explained as follows. (1) The self-reports involve the interaction between two individuals (the interaction between clients and the guanxi

members). (2) The identity features of the participants are clear, and the construction and the changes in the relationship between them are observable. (3) The content being communicated has specific interpersonal features, such as expression of emotion or attitude. In other words, self-reports satisfy the data scope of interpersonal pragmatics analysis (Ran & Liu 2015).

This study takes a process-oriented approach to examine interpersonal relationships and interpersonal emotions, thus distinguishing itself from the prior studies (Spencer-Oatey 2002; Culpeper 2011) which draw on self-reports for analysis. Moreover, the role of the participants, the nature of their relationship, and the social norms within the society contribute to a comprehensive understanding of interpersonal relationships and interpersonal emotions. It is hoped this study can advance people's understanding of relating and expand the research in interpersonal pragmatics.

# 9.2.6 Practical Implication: a Framework for Improving Mental and Emotional Health

In addition to the above theoretical implications, this study has the following practical implications: (1) the types of GQVI discordant rapport presented in Chapter 6 may be applied to the analysis of the cause of clients' negative emotions in psychotherapeutic training and practice, especially in the Chinese context. The surrogate-based rapport management strategies presented in Chapter 7 could be integrated into emotion-managing guidelines. (2) This study sheds light on the harmonious relationship between people. As the data analysis shows, people's emotional well-being is closely associated with their significant others (the parents or close friends). Though language cannot unite or separate people physically (Langlotz 2010), they have a direct impact on people's understanding of relationships and their emotional status. An analysis of the background information of clients further reveals that the emotional problems caused by relational disharmony lead to more severe physical or mental or social problems, such as severe depression, schoolchildren dropping out of school, etc. To solve these social problems, the healing power of language cannot be overlooked.

Moreover, as one is likely to see a fast increase in the number of people who have depressed feelings and their reliance on trusted ones to help them out, possessing the ability and knowledge to handle others' unmet expectations and the accusations they receive is becoming an essential attribute of good teachers, good parents, good partners, etc. It is hoped that the findings reported will be of value not only to therapists and practitioners but also to those who are concerned about the well-being of

their significant others, for instance, the school teachers who are concerned about their students' well-being; the parents who show concern to the psychological well-being of their children, and people who care about their friends' emotional health and mental health (Pawelczyk 2011: 55).

# 9.3 Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research

Although this study has obtained interesting findings and drawn conclusions to the research questions, there are certainly some limitations that await further exploration.

Firstly, the limitation of the amount and sources of data should be noted. It is a demanding job to collect enough data for a qualitative study or a pragmatic study. It has requirements on how much data is collected and how it is collected. Although much effort has been made to collect data, it still leaves much to be improved. It has been suggested that video data can provide more information about interlocutors' emotional status than audio data and they are preferable for analyzing emotions, however the difficulty in accessing it makes it a limitation.

The second limitation of this study suffers from its generalizability of the findings. GQVI's discordant rapport is limited to interpersonal interaction in close and long-term relationships. In Chinese interpersonal relationships and communication, other expectations other than ganqing could be involved, serving as the cause of interlocutors' negative emotions. Moreover, because of the variabilities of the psychotherapeutic philosophies of therapists, the research findings cannot reflect all types of surrogate-based rapport management strategies that are employed to manage negative emotions caused by discordant rapport in psychotherapeutic discourse.

Thirdly, As the data analysis shows, surrogate-based rapport management is dedicated to managing GQVI discordant rapport clients have with NPTPs and in this way managing clients' negative emotions, which is the major concern and dominant functions played by these surrogate-based rapport management strategies. In addition to this, these strategies might simultaneously manage the relationship therapists have with their clients. For instance, by using surrogate-based aggressive strategies (i.e., pseudo-surrogating clients and using aggressive strategies), therapists not only protect the sociality rights of clients but also display similar feelings with clients. Further studies can approach this perspective and examine therapists' efforts in managing the rapport they have with clients, which provides emotional support and might also contribute to the management of clients' negative emotions.

The analytic method is the fourth limitation that is worth noting. In the analysis of interlocutors' negative emotional reactions and therapists' intervention to these negative emotions, the interactional approach is

taken. To capture more detailed information regarding interlocutors' emotional features, Praat software can be used.

All in all, the attempts made in this research have at least provided some suggestions, cues, or hopefully even directions for further indigenous research on interpersonal pragmatics. As scholars of Chinese pragmatics have proposed, we should consider the social and humanistic factors (Qian 2001), and the social needs when doing our pragmatic research (He 2018, quoted from Ran 2018). Meanwhile, we should give prominence to Chinese sociocultural features/specific contextual features while drawing on Western theories of pragmatics (Huo 2009). The brilliant Chinese culture and various forms of interpersonal communication provide fertile ground for the study of Chinese interpersonal pragmatics, making it a research area that deserves sustained and further exploration.

# Notes

1. Importantly, the type of negative emotions that the double lines pointed to are the terminals of the whole process, but note the fact that the process is an ever-going circulation.

2 Given the research focus of this study, the enhancement of discordant rapport is not discussed.
