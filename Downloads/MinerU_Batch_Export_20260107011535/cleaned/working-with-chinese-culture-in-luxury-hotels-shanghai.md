Abstract: There are very limited researches about how expatriates face the cultural challenges when they work in China, while it has become increasing important with more multinational organisations moving to the biggest market. The authors attempt to examine this complicated issue which includes culture conflicts, staff motivation, employees' resistance to foreign management, communications, and relationship building (Guan Xi) in the organisation. Expatriates working in luxury hotels were chosen to do the study as its high international integration level. The fieldwork data collection was based on semi-structure in-depth interviews with six foreign managers currently working in international branded hotels, and two participants who have undergone management training in the same industry. It was found in this study that lack of initiative, reluctance to accept responsibility and language barrier are the prevailing difficulties that expatriate managers face in the workplace. Other issues, such as Chinese staff motivation and relationship building also discussed in this research.

# 1 Introduction

The hotel industry in China is considered to be one of the most important parts of tourism and a symbol of 'opening and reform', which not only generates most of the tourist revenue, but also contributes significantly to employment and acts as an accelerator of economic and social development. According to Pang et al. (1998), from 1978 to 1997, hotels in China increased from merely 203 to 5201, maintaining an annual increase of  $18.61\%$ , which may be one of the fastest growing hotel industries in the world in the same period.

There is no information available on the number of expatriate managers involved in Chinese hotel industry, however, according to Zinzius (2004), overall, about 450 000 westerners and overseas Chinese work in mainland China, they play an important part in China's growth, acting as an enormous resource that enables China's transition from a planned communist economy to a socialist market economy.

National culture has significant implications in hospitality industry, due to hospitality industry's international nature, where hotel employees constantly interact with guests and coworkers of different cultures. Very often interaction between different cultures causes cultural conflicts. Hope (2004) therefore suggests that differences in the beliefs, values and attitudes of people of different culture, operational practices need to be adapted in order to work successfully. Many academics (Hope and Muhlemann, 2001; Morden, 1991; Rodrigues, 1998, cited in Hope, 2004) have argued that adaptations may need to be made when transferring practices between nations because of the impact of national culture and have suggested that cultural differences have implications on managers.

Huyton and Ingold (1995, cited in Hope, 2004) reported that the Ritz-Carlton faced operational problems in Hong-Kong despite trying to operate in the same manner that had won them the Malcolm Baldrige Award for Quality in the USA. Similarly, Teare (1993, cited in Hope, 2004) explained how the Hyatt does recognise the need to adapt procedures when operating in different countries. And although, Hope (2004) argues that evidence clearly exists which supports the argument that national culture does have an impact on foreign managers, the research in this area, especially in hospitality industry has not been extensive. Therefore the research introduced in this study attempts to contribute to existing knowledge in this area, as well as to test previous findings in terms of their relevance nowadays. As such the research is thought to be both confirmatory and exploratory in nature. Particularly, this study focuses on expatriate managers and management aspects of hotel operation, rather than operational procedures. As such, issues relating to cultural differences between product and customer, in this case hotel services and hotel guests are not addressed. Expatriate managers who are mostly strangers to Chinese culture very frequently experience challenges working in China, as a result of cultural differences.

The main aim of this research is to examine how Chinese culture creates challenges for expatriate managers working in luxury hotels in Shanghai. The authors also want to identify major motivational factors for Chinese hotel employees and evaluate the importance of 'Guan Xi' for expatriate managers in their working environment.

# 2 Literature Review

# 2.1 National Culture and International Hospitality Industry

It is thought that initially a sound explanation of national culture and the theory surrounding it should be provided in order to set up the scene for the investigation. "Culture has been defined in many ways by different social science scholars" (Yu, 1999, p.58). One of the most frequently cited contribution to cultural research is the work of Gert Hofstede, who suggests that national culture is "the collective programming of the mind acquired by growing up in a particular country" (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2005). He further suggests that people share a collective national character that shapes their values, attitudes, competencies, behaviour, and perceptions of priority. Evidently an individuals' national culture will vary significantly in accordance to the specific country within which they reside. In other words, culture affects how people think and behave. As a result, it is vital that hospitality enterprises relate the theory surrounding the research implemented regarding national cultures into practice, in order to ensure a smooth operation of their business within a different country and culture.

There has been much extensive research implemented in order to comprehend different cultures. When analysed and implemented effectively this research can be used in order to assist international hospitality enterprises when crossing national boundaries. Gooderham and Nordhaug (2003, p.131) argue that "dissecting and explaining any foreign culture is potentially a never-ending exercise", and suggest that as an alternative to in-depth single country studies scholars have attempted to classify cultures in relation to one another by using a few, relatively broad fundamental dimensions that are particularly relevant to management practice. To define culture Hofstede and Hofstede (2005, cited in Kessapidou and Varsakelis, 2002) draws a telling analogy between culture and mental programming. He relates culture, that is, patterns of thinking and acting, to mental programs, which constitute the 'software of the mind'. His work, analysis and classifications of different cultures are mainly based on the so called 'Morale Survey' he has implemented. Hofstede studied the work related attitudes and values from 53 national subsidiaries of the large international company IBM. The aim was to understand how individuals' values and beliefs about motivation hierarchy and leadership differed depending upon the country in which they lived. Through this extensive research, he then classified all of the countries within the study into eight distinct categories, ranging from Latin through to Asian, Germanic, Anglo, Nordic, etc. To identify cultural relativity, Hofstede relied on four value dimensions that explain differences among work related value patterns and affect the structuring and functioning of organisations (Kessapidou and Varsakelis, 2002). The four dimensions listed are power distance, masculinity, individualism and uncertainty avoidance. The determined classifications can assist a hospitality organisation attempting to understand the culture of the country they wish to operate in.

Another group of academics Daniels and Radebaugh (2007, p.49) state that "Culture refers to the learned norms based on attitudes, values, and beliefs of a group of people." This definition generally agrees with Hofstede's, however, the work is more specific and uses nation as a point of reference. "Nation provides a workable definition of a culture because the basic similarity among people is both a cause and an effect of national boundaries", nevertheless, a given country may encompass very distinct societies, people also may have more in common with similar groups in foreign countries than with

groups in their own country (Daniels and Radebaugh, 2007, pp.50-51). The extensive research implemented by Hofstede and other social science scholars, indicates that there are many different dimensions and aspects to national culture.

# 2.2 Chinese Culture, Value and Confucianism

Although the survey conducted by Hofstede determined four main dimensions of national culture and thus made it possible to classify countries into certain categories, Mainland China was not included, because at that time it was closed for foreign companies and thus, IBM did not have a subsidiary there. As a result, later on, a fifth dimension of national culture known as Confucian dynamism was derived through a Chinese Value Survey. Confucian dynamism assesses long term versus short-term orientation where long term relates to, future rewards perseverance and thrift and short term outlines respect for tradition, perseverance of face and fulfilling social obligations (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2005). According to Hofstede and Hofstede (2005), China possesses the highest power distance and the lowest individualism among all Asian nations; in contrast, its long-term orientation is the highest.

"Doing business in China, requires more than technical, financial, marketing, and management know how. It requires the ability to understand the Chinese, their mentality, business style, and ethics, including their Confucian values. It requires understanding of the magnitude of the transition that China is undergoing: The largest economic, social, and political change in the world's history. Only those that are able to understand the concepts, values and motivations of the Chinese, will be able to do successful business in China and cooperate or compete with the Chinese." (Zinzius, 2004, pp.217-218)

Zinzius (2004) also argues that the most important lesson of Confucianism concerns the unequal relationships between men, whereupon the stability of the society is found, therefore, the society can be nothing other than a strong hierarchical and patriarchal system, if it wants to maintain stability.

As individuals, we generally only become aware of our own culture when confronted by another. However, what we usually observe are the artefacts of cultural dissimilarity – the numerous and often pronounced differences in greeting rituals, dress codes, forms of address and taste, the underlying system of values is, however, neither readily observable nor readily comprehensible (Gooderham and Nordhaug, 2003). Therefore, it is also important to have an overview of the values – the 'driving force' of Chinese culture.

The level of trust between individuals often dictates the way they communicate. Communication between 'accepted' members of a group is free and uninhibited, whereas communication in the presence of an 'outsider' restricts the freedom of expression. The choice of words is important when communicating with a Chinese person, as misinterpretation may lead to misunderstanding. Likewise, given the indirectness of Chinese communication, one would be wise to 'read between the lines' for double or hidden meanings. Often, a seemingly harmless statement made by a Chinese person will hide a message within the apparent message. Although the Chinese do not deliberately hide the truth, they frequently do not offer it in a straightforward Western manner. They describe their communication style as 'wan zuan', which is non-confrontational, nonprovoking, non-threatening, polite and graceful, but still carrying the full meaning and force of the message. Negotiating with Chinese also follows different rules. During

negotiations they use strategies and tactics that may seem inappropriate to western standards. "Chinese seem to especially enjoy a game of cat and mouse with their negotiating partners; it is a kind of fighting game, an intellectual tournament that nevertheless is aimed toward mutual agreement" (Zinzius, 2004, p.45). Harris and Morran (2004) add that collectivism reflects negotiations as well, as they must cover interests of many different parties, and the Chinese might bring more people to join negotiating team midway through negotiations. The differences between Western and Chinese styles of negotiation are listed in Table 1:

# 2.3 the Concept of 'face' and 'guanxi' in Management

In understanding Chinese interpersonal behaviour the most significant factors are 'face' and 'guanxi'. Although this is a human universal behaviour, the Chinese have developed a sensitivity to it and used it as a reference point in behaviour in a much more sophisticated and developed way than in other culture. (Redding, 1982, cited in Gilbert and Tsao, 2000). The Chinese written character for 'face' is a symbol representing respectability, reputation and pride. When a Chinese is said to 'love his/her "face"', it implies that the individual measures his/her status in society, cares how he/she is seen in public, and displays a pride in him/herself. The traditional 'class' system has given way to a new 'status' system, in which the position of an individual, distinguishes that person from fellow comrades. Performance is partly determined by the loyalty and affection shown by subordinates and which is, in return, displayed. Titles, to the Chinese, symbolise importance and achievement, and demand recognition. A Chinese has 'face' when addressed by title, by superiors, peers and subordinates alike. It is a form of distinction that evolved during the communist regime and is usually linked with seniority as opposed to capability. Many believe that the loss of 'face' only occurs when a Chinese is criticised, humiliated, ridiculed or subdued in public. This is, however, not true. A manager who decides to discipline a Chinese employee by singling the person out in public may provoke and encourage vengeful reaction against him/herself, and therefore negative feedback should be shared in a one-to-one context. However, if the manager does not proceed with caution, discretion and tact, he/she could still make the employee lose 'face', which according to Laserre and Probert (1996, cited in Pang et al., 1998) "can have considerable disruptive effects" whether the subjugation is conducted publicly or privately.

"Guan Xi means 'relations', and it stands for connections defined by reciprocity and mutual obligations. A network of family, friends and acquaintances is built up, who can provide material or immaterial support of any means, based on personal favors." (Zinzius, 2004, p183)

Sutton (1995, cited in Mwaura et al., 1998) comments that the accepted use of 'Guan xi' or 'backdoor' routes to resolve problems, is a common and accepted way of doing business in China, and it should not be equated to corruption or nepotism. Ambler (1994, cited in Pang et al., 1998) suggests that it is more akin to public relations practised in the West, the major difference being that its focus is on building interpersonal relations. In China, the use of 'Guan Xi' is the quickest and surest route to accomplishment. Davies et al. (1995, cited in Pang et al., 1998) highlighted a number of benefits to be derived from 'Guan Xi':

It can serve as an information gathering mechanism.

It can act as a means of securing access to important resources.

- It smoothes the process of gaining privileges such as government licences, etc.

It is often used to enhance company reputation.

- It can contribute to the building and enhancement of competitive advantage; and it can serve to open doors where once they were firmly shut.

Indeed, all the senior Chinese managers in the recent research (Haley and Haley, 2006) stressed the importance of creating and nurturing formal and informal relationship networks internally and externally. However, 'Guan Xi' is a delicate rule-governed tool. A favour granted will be met by an unspoken promise of a favour to be returned in the future, but it involves a sensitive choice of words, and is not to be abused. According to a study done by Ichiro Numazaki (1987, cited in Gilbert and Tsao, 2000), 'personal trust' is one of the key mechanisms on which 'Guan xi' and partnerships are based. Therefore, acceptance and trust are paramount to its use. Gilbert and Tsao (2000) also suggest that the key component of 'Guan Xi' dynamics is 'face', as one must have a certain amount of prestige to cultivate and develop a viable network of connections.

# 2.4 Transferability of International/western Culture Into Chinese Working Organisation

Child and Markoczy (1993, p.618, cited in Mwaura et al., 1998) argue that "the influence of China's long past is ever present in the environment, the language, the folklore and the practices of government, business and interpersonal relations". Many theorists therefore argue that the Chinese culture is a strong determinant of the ways in which organisations in China are managed (Child and Markoczy 1993, p.18, cited in Mwaura et al., 1998).

According to the Hofstede's terminology, different cultures imply different mental programming, which governs activities, motivation and values. Zinzius (2004) argues that a manager cannot motivate Chinese employees if he bases his interactions with them on the assumption that the Chinese react and think like people do at home. According to Zinzius (2004), he also will not be successful if he is of the opinion that the best motivation is to encourage employees' search for self-realisation and to allow personal freedom, as it is done in the Western world. Self-realisation, a strong motivation for many in the Western world, motivates only a few Chinese.

In a study conducted by Gilbert and Tsao (2000), six out of seven hotels reported their organisation's culture to be relation-oriented. By this they explained the emphasis is on a people-oriented approach which is to build relationships, these personal relationships need close attention and constant, or at least frequent contact – if they are to motivate.

Mwaura et al. (1998) suggest that effecting cultural change, within organisations, is probably one of the hardest aspects of implementing a management system, this may be even more difficult if the national culture traits of a workforce conflict with the philosophies of a 'foreign' management style. Current western management styles are generally based around corporate cultures that are oriented towards developing quality and customer satisfaction by building a sense of personal ownership into service excellence, this is achieved by promoting open and honest communication and a blame-free internal culture, where work is undertaken in teams, knowledge is freely-shared, and staff are empowered to take decisions, to manage risk and to become self-managing (Mwaura et al., 1998). The research conducted by Mwaura et al. (1998), which uses The Great Wall Sheraton Hotel Beijing as a specific case study, identified several aspects of Chinese culture through a sequence of observed critical incidents which demonstrated areas of divergence between national and corporate culture, which in turn provoked management difficulties. The incidents observed were classified into groups by their relationships to aspects of culture which appear to be predominant in China. These groups were identified as (Mwaura et al., 1998):

- Personal relationships – are more valued by the Chinese people than work values, e.g., teamwork.
- Lack of empowerment - Chinese managers and subordinate staff are not ready to accept responsibility.
- Meaning of life - ideal life is rooted in an original or primitive human society and culture which places high priority on naturalness and simplicity.
- Training - The concept of 'face' is responsible for the reluctance of staff to contribute verbally in the classroom/training situation.
- Communication - Sutton (1995, cited in Mwaura et al., 1998) suggests that most communication barriers are caused by differences in cultural conception, rather than just language, and further adds (Sutton and Huyton, 1996, cited in Mwaura et al., 1998) that to many Chinese, knowledge is power, and is closely guarded.
- Human resources management – While the Chinese believe a job is there for life, western corporate policies are more geared towards rewarding staff for a job well done or dismissing them if they fail to meet the required standards. This causes conflict because Chinese managers prefer to maintain peace and harmony rather than implement just and fair practices in hiring and maintaining staff. Another important aspect, suggested by Gilbert and Tsao (2000), is that ‘personal trust’ is the major criterion in recruiting people in China. In other words, the person must be either personally known by the boss or be introduced by a person whom the boss trusts.

Pang et al. (1998) argues that multinational organisations seeking business opportunities and intending to transfer their corporate cultures into China face the mammoth task of researching into the Chinese culture and traits, and localising their corporate cultures

on the basis of the Chinese characteristics, for only then will their corporate cultures be recognised by the Chinese. They further suggest that corporate culture should not, however, be seen as a substitute for the Chinese culture, rather, it should be an extension of the local culture at an organisational level with organisational goals and functions, because senior Chinese managers, unfortunately, maintain the view that the introduction of corporate culture is an organisational attempt to control Chinese staff. Consequently, to successfully transfer corporate cultures, organisations need to improve their understanding of, and adaptation to, the Chinese culture, continuously evolving to avoid direct confrontation with the Chinese society and complete rejection.

# 2.5 Summary

Having identified main socio-cultural concepts, which are key to understanding Chinese culture, it is clearly seen that expatriates potentially create a cultural clash within a hotel organisation. Therefore, it is essential to recognise the potential areas of conflict that create challenges for expatriate managers when working in China. The most common situations have been identified from previous researchers, however as the culture evolves over a period of time, they should be tested for relevance nowadays, as well as new problems may have emerged, which have to be identified as well. Furthermore, it is evident that there is a considerable gap in relevant literature concerning motivation of the Chinese staff, and the study attempts to provide more information on this issue.

# 3 Research Methods

Broadly the social sciences and business typically distinguish between qualitative and quantitative research. Most attempts to define these approaches use one to define the other (Jary and Jary, 1991 cited in Clark et al., 1998). Since the research aims to examine 'expatriate managers' perspective' on difficulties they might come across when working in a hotel in China, the choice of method and sample was obvious. Hence, qualitative approach was considered appropriate, as it emphasises processes and meanings that cannot be rigorously examined or measured in terms of quantity, amount, intensity, or frequency, and it seeks to answer questions that focus on how social experience is created and given (Denzin and Lincoln, 1994). As the research instrument a semi-structured in-depth telephone interview was adopted to collect data for the study. According to Gilbert and Tsao (2000), the semi-structured interview allows the interviewer to add supplementary questions to probe, or get a deeper insight into the content and meaning of the answers given. Kvale (1983, cited in Pine and Qi, 2004) argues that of all the qualitative methods, the in-depth interview may be argued as being the most powerful tool to gain insights into the socially constructed realities of individuals. By using the in-depth interview, the interviewees are introduced to the topic through general questions. Then, Howe (1985, cited in Pine and Qi, 2004) suggests that through probing and prompting of interviewees for deeper descriptions the interviewer can understand replies from their respondents' perspectives and then interpret them for contextualisation. Semi-structured interviews are usually prearranged with a selected respondent. During the interview the interviewer works within a defined topic and has some prearranged questions developed to act as a framework for the interview. These questions are prompts

to help the interviewer and are sometimes called an interview guide or aide-memoire. Sometimes not all the questions will be used on the aide-memoire; it depends on whether the respondent has already addressed the material during an earlier question, which quite often happens.

Extensive literature review provided the base for creating a research framework, and consequently interview questions. Mostly open-ended questions were developed to provide feedback on each individual's perception of previously discovered issues, related to influence of Chinese culture in a hotel working environment. As relatively short questioning design is vital for telephone interviews, the interview questions were developed as concise as possible, at the same time covering all the possible areas of the research.

Poynter (1993) suggests that the first step to developing interview sampling is to determine exactly what target audience will be contacted. A very challenging part of the research was securing interviews, and although there are a great number of hotels in Shanghai and majority of the managers working there are expatriates, approaching them was very difficult. Initially one ideal interviewee was secured, and it was thought that a 'snowballing' approach could be used, where a person who possesses wide knowledge of the research area introduces the researcher to potential interviewees and they consequently can recommend other suitable individuals for further interviewing. Each interview lasted for between 60 to  $90\mathrm{min}$  and all the interviewed have been recorded for later data interpretation.

It should be mentioned that participants' names are not used in the presented results, due to the participants' preference.

The research sample consisted of eight participants. Information about them is presented in Table 2:

# 4 Findings

Relevant results were identified in the areas of: initial challenges, resistance from Chinese employees, managing the Chinese, motivation, adaptation and integration into Chinese working environment, importance of 'Guan Xi'.

# 4.1 Initial Challenges

Language barrier is the main difficulty expatriate managers experience at work upon arrival to China. The overall level of English in international hotels in Shanghai is thought to be lower than expected.

In order to help to identify possible difficulties foreign managers may face at initial stage, when they arrive to China, question number 3 (see Appendix) was asked: "Were you aware of Chinese culture and its peculiarities prior to working in China and to which extent?" It revealed that two out of eight managers did not have any knowledge of Chinese culture before they entered the country; the rest described themselves as "being aware, but not possessing extensive knowledge". Most of the managers acquired certain knowledge through literature, such as books and magazine articles, to prepare themselves in advance. The internet was also mentioned by one participant. Regardless of knowledge, all the managers agreed they experienced a very different culture upon arrival. One of the participants has even visited the country several times, but still was not fully prepared for Chinese culture:

"Having always been fascinated with Chinese culture, I visited the country a few times and read many books and magazine articles concerning it. Yet, upon my arrival, I realized that my knowledge and understanding were not as deep as I believed they were."

All the participants, identified language barrier as the main difficulty they experienced upon arrival to China. None of them spoke Chinese, and they generally assumed that most of the hotel staff would have a good command of English, however this was not the case. The overall level of English was much lower than the participants expected it to be:

"Starting to work in a high class hotel such as XXXX, I was surprised how many staff members were not able to speak English. Some of them had a basic knowledge of English, but it (English) was not something compulsory, so they could not communicate with foreign guests. And this created some kind of a wall between them and me."

# 4.2 Resistance from Chinese Employees

Expatriate managers meet no resistance from local staff, when implementing foreign/western procedures, due to the staff being highly motivated to learn from foreign experience.

Expatriates managers in China are expected to be experts in a given field and possess extensive knowledge in the area they specialise.

All the participants stated that they did not meet any resistance from Chinese employees and described the atmosphere as 'welcoming and friendly'. The managers also felt that the Chinese expect foreigners to be experts in a given field, professionals who carry the knowledge and know how. This is mainly the reason for the lack of resistance:

"No, I haven't met any resistance. Not at all, to the contrary. I found the staff extremely eager to learn different ways of operating and thinking."

"They know that if you come here (in China), you often come with knowledge and I believe and feel that people (the Chinese) really want to learn from that knowledge."

One of the managers also pointed out:

"For sure you ARE a foreigner for them (the Chinese) and that is why they are much more flexible with you than among themselves."

However, at a later stage of interview, it was revealed that one of the managers does experience some sort of resistance from certain employees:

"Interviewer: What difficulties did you experience when managing the Chinese?

Respondent: With the ones with an open mind and a thirst for learning, there were no problems, but it has been difficult to deal with the ones picked by and devoted to the owner of the hotel (we manage hotels for and on behalf of local individual or government-owned hotels), and with the ones who knew only the Chinese management techniques and who were not open or willing to learn western ways of managing."

# 4.3 Managing Chinese Employees

Lack of initiative and reluctance to accept responsibilities are the prevailing challenges for expatriate managers when managing Chinese employees.

Through interview it was identified that the Chinese are more used to a different concept of management than in Western culture, with much stricter front line and supervisory relationships. It was indicated that the Chinese members of staff expected: "a dictatorial, rather than collaborative management style". This in turn resulted in lack of initiative from Chinese employees and they did not readily accept responsibilities, this was the case in all the interviewed hotels. The Chinese employees seemed to be used to carry out orders, rather than to make adjustments. Therefore, it was suggested by the managers that with the lack of initiative and language barrier, expatriate managers need to be very specific and provide detailed step-by-step instructions, when giving directions to Chinese employees. This aspect is described below:

"There are some Chinese who use their own initiative, but most of them, in general, are pretty much used to the fact that there is a boss, who tells them what to do and they will follow. This is something you have to know, and besides this you have to make sure they understand what you say, because many times they say 'Yes', but they don't have any idea what should be done.

You need to be very energetic in China, and you need to carry a lot by yourself. In their mind you are the boss, you get paid and you take all the responsibility."

It was also suggested that foreign managers should learn about unique Chinese thinking process, in order to be able to operate more effectively in China.

# 4.4 Motivation

Rewards and acquisition of knowledge are the main motivational factors for the Chinese employees.

Rewarding individual employees does not cause a conflict with the concept of 'face'.

According to the managers, they believe that reward is the most essential motivational factor for the Chinese employees. The examples given were: incentive programmes, acknowledgment, financial compensation, etc. Acquisition of knowledge, as well as training and development were also identified as very important sources of motivation, though they sometimes require convincing employees that they will benefit from learning and knowing different techniques and concepts. One of the managers has also stressed that rewarding is the dominant motivation driver over other approaches, his comments are provided below:

"Well, I won't agree with some surveys that are out on the market that say that... acquisition of knowledge is more highly sought after than remuneration, because that's not the case. The remuneration is still very important. I mean, most of the hotels here (in Shanghai) are working with various incentive programs, such as up-selling incentive systems. But, that's it. After ensuring the best you can do for remuneration, which hospitality is not known for its generosity, I would say training and development is highly sought after. And then acquisition of knowledge is a good motivator."

Certain participants pointed out that Chinese managers in general do not adapt remuneration as a management tool for motivating staff, expatriate managers mostly received positive results by rewarding their employees. When asked if rewarding individual members of staff goes into conflict with the concept of 'face', the managers commented that it does not cause the 'loss of face', and employees are even willing to receive recognition. Drawing some of the examples from experience, a few managers also advised that 'pushing the employees into taking responsibilities and giving them ideas' is an effective approach.

# 4.5 Adaptation and Integration Into Chinese Working Environment

Understanding Chinese culture is a key factor to successful hotel operation in China. Suggestions for faster adaptation and integration into Chinese working environment are: open-minded and positive attitude, interaction with the Chinese, learning the language, possessing cultural knowledge beforehand.

All the managers were able to identify the importance of accepting and respecting different culture for faster integration into Chinese working environment. The interviewees also suggested several strategies for adaptation to Chinese culture, main points of which are summarised below:

- Being open-minded

Positive attitude

- Investing in spending time with the Chinese, that is also socialising with local staff (e.g., dinners, going out). Spending time with colleagues outside of work is very much practised in China and is thought to be a necessity.
- Learning the language. By learning Chinese, expatriate managers do not only benefit from knowing the language and being able to communicate with Chinese employees directly, but also from staff appreciation, as it is regarded to be a gesture of respect for their culture.
- Being well prepared in advance. This includes researching and studying about Chinese culture before going to China, which also was claimed to decrease cultural shock, provide better understanding of work issues and reduce adaptation time to a possible minimum.

Furthermore, all the participants further suggested that understanding Chinese culture is the key to a successful operation. New expatriate managers are advised to place the best of their efforts to try to understand Chinese culture, values, and underlying issues of everyday activities, as once mastered they can greatly benefit from it.

# 4.6 Importance of 'guan Xi' and Its Application by Foreign Managers

'Guan Xi' is important for expatriate managers, and they should be ready to utilise it, as it is a widely accepted tool for accomplishing goals in China.

The participants were asked what they think of 'Guan Xi' with a focus on expatriate managers and if the same rules of this concept apply to them. The majority of managers stated that 'Guan Xi' is of great importance, and it is essential to be aware of this concept as this is the way of doing business in China. In China having connections means having power, and 'Guan Xi' is openly accepted in China and expatriate managers should be prepared to establish their 'Guan Xi' by building personal networks and securing connections, as well as to provide favours when asked to. Here is an example of how a manager describes the importance of 'Guan Xi':

"Interviewer: Do you think 'Guan Xi' is important in China?

Respondent: Yes, 'Guan Xi' is very very important! I believe in China this is one of the most important things. You need to be prepared to really get to know people fast in a special way and basically 'Guan Xi' is the only way to move forward, to get things done.

Interviewer: So do you think it is ALSO important for foreigner managers?

Respondent: Yes, absolutely. I think if you have good 'Guan Xi', good relationships your work is a lot lot easier. And this applies to foreign managers in exactly the same way as to the Chinese."

On the other hand, one of the managers argued that the term 'Guan Xi' is overestimated and perceived more important and powerful than it actually is. The comments are provided below:

"Interviewer: Do you think 'Guan Xi' is important in China?"

Respondent: Look, it is important, but it is not quite as unique in Chinese culture as people like to make it out to be. We have 'Guan Xi' in western culture just by another name, it's called relationship. Ok, maybe it's more hierarchical, structured system, but it's not too dissimilar from what we just call professional relationships in western culture."

Interviewer: Are you saying then it is not as powerful tool as people tend to think it is?

Respondent: I think it's overhyped a little bit

Interviewer: But still, do you think it is important for a foreign manager to build his or her network while working in China?

Respondent: Yes, definitely. Relationships, 'Guan Xi', you can call it whatever you want, help to accomplish things in the industry. Perhaps it's a little bit more structured here, but not markedly."

# 5 Discussion and Interpretation

There are three major issues related to national culture which the authors consider worthy discussing.

# 5.1 Chinese Cultural Challenges for Expatriates

# 5.1.1 Lack of Initiative and Reluctance to Accept Responsibilities

The findings indicate that lack of initiative was the main difficulty expatriate managers face in hotels when managing Chinese employees. This phenomenon can be related to Hofstede's cultural dimensions. 'Power distance' and 'collectivism' seem to create barriers to using own initiative and taking on responsibilities, which goes in line with Hofstede and Hofstede's (2005) classification, where China possesses lowest 'individualism' and highest 'power distance' among all Asian nation. In interviewed hotels, the Chinese staff in general was reluctant to accept responsibilities. High 'power distance' is responsible for strict and distinct relationships between managers/supervisors and subordinates, which in turn results in staff expecting to be given 'orders' that they have to follow without neither questioning nor making adjustments. The underlying reason for the Chinese high 'power distance' is Confucianism, as according to Zinzius (2004) the most important lesson of Confucianism concerns the unequal relationships between men, whereupon the stability of the society is found, therefore, the society can be nothing other than a strong hierarchical and patriarchal system, if it wants to maintain stability.

As a 'collectivist' nation (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2005), the Chinese have a strong group orientation which leads to present difficulties for the development of individual responsibility. (Mwaura et al., 1998). According to Bong and Hwang (1986, cited in Mwaura et al., 1998), that significance is attached to the concept of:

"face, as the Chinese tend to attach great importance to the views others hold about them more than in western culture, and therefore avoid actions which for them are high risks, or about which there is some uncertainty regarding the correctness of the outcome."

This creates a certain challenge for foreign (Western) managers who are mostly used to collaborative, participatory management style, where staff are empowered to take decisions, to manage risks and to become self managing (Mwaura et al., 1998).

# 5.1.2 Resistance

Pang et al. (1998) in their study of Chinese employees at a Beijing hotel claim that the concept of corporate culture meets strong resistance from many Chinese people, who believe foreign ideals and concepts are not to be trusted. They further argue that

the Chinese place a lot of importance on trust, which is hard-earned and prior to acceptance, an 'outsider' can expect suspicion, resistance, and endless probing, due to Chinese long-term orientation, which views 'outsiders', namely expatriates/foreigners, as short-term players who do not fit into their long-term plans, and therefore not readily trusted or easily accepted.

The research, however, showed that most of the expatriate managers met no resistance. And on the contrary, the Chinese staff were felt to be welcoming and friendly and readily accepted foreign methods and techniques. It was also suggested to the researcher, that the reason for this is that Chinese see expatriate managers as experts/professionals, who possess vast knowledge and experience in a certain area, and were eager to learn from these knowledge and experience. However, this posed high expectations on expatriate managers from local staff.

As this finding is contradictory to other academic researches, it may be argued that it is mistaken. However, Haley and Haley (2006, p.29) in their recent research suggest that "business and social environments in emerging markets are changing at phenomenal rates", which is thought to be the case with resistance to foreign managers in China. It is, therefore, believed that attitudes and behaviour of the Chinese towards western management and practices have undergone significant transformation.

# 5.1.3 Language Barrier

Language barrier was identified as the biggest challenge for expatriate managers at initial stage of working in China. The information about this particular issue was found to be very limited. Despite of a variety of literature available about Chinese language, there is very little said about foreigners who experience language difficulties. Although it seems obvious that going to a different country without knowing the language will lead to a language barrier created between the foreigner and local population, it is thought that very often foreign managers underestimate this issue. Most of the managers use English as the language of communication and/or communicate with the employees through an intermediary. This often results in enormous difficulties and can be very 'tiring', as described by interviewed managers. All the managers furthermore expressed their concern about level of English in hotels in Shanghai, as a general opinion it was lower than expected and still remains nowadays. All the interviewees either started studying Chinese or already had a decent command of it, and reported improved performance.

# 5.2 Motivating Chinese Employees

As it was mentioned earlier, there has been a limited research carried out concerning motivation of Chinese employees, especially in hospitality industry.

Zinzius (2004) suggests that the Chinese employees' personal relationships with their boss, combined with numerous positive experiences, are the main sources of motivation. She, therefore proposes that the manager must be a shinning example, a leader with whom employees can identify, in other words, 'the good boss' is the most important motivational factor.

The research discovered that main motivational factors for Chinese employees in hotel sector are: reward and acquisition of knowledge. The interviewees however pointed out that even though, learning new techniques and approaches is a very important source

of motivation, still rewards and incentives play a major role in motivating Chinese hotel staff. Training and development were also commented as highly sought after when motivating staff.

Many scholars may argue that employing this method may cause a conflict, due to the concept of 'face'. Mwaura et al. (1998) for example, suggest that the collectivist society requires the Chinese employees to place relationships before achievement and as a result no one wants to appear superior to another, or to make another feel inferior. However, when expatriate managers were asked about this issue, they have claimed that it does not cause any confrontation between the members of staff, and on the contrary it was felt that employees were willing to be recognised and acknowledged. Some of the managers also mentioned introducing a few 'western' motivational techniques, such as 'pushing employees into taking responsibility' and they were proved to be successful.

Rewarding has been a widely practised management tool in Western world, however, on the contrary, the respondents mentioned that Chinese managers in general do not use rewarding/incentive programmes, and therefore, participants had some sort of advantage over them.

# 5.3 'guan Xi'

The importance of 'Guan Xi' was explored in research regarding its application to foreign managers. In business relations, 'Guan Xi' can be considered as drawing on connections or networks in order to secure personal or business favours (Gilbert and Tsao, 2000). And according to Pang et al. (1998) it is the quickest and surest route to accomplishment.

There has been a lot of research undertaken to study this unique component of Chinese culture. However, this particular research aimed to examine whether foreign managers establish their 'Guan Xi' when working in China and whether it works in the same way for them as for the Chinese. All the interviewed managers stated that 'Guan Xi' is of a significant importance for both the Chinese and foreigners, and that the Chinese do expect foreigners to build their personal network, be granted and return favours. One of the managers, however, expressed his opinion about 'Guan Xi' as being perceived more powerful and unique that it actually is, and arguing that personal relationships in western culture is very similar to 'Guan Xi', with only exception that it is a more structured and hierarchical system in China. This statement supports Pang et al. (1998) observation which suggests that 'Guan Xi' is more akin to public relations practised in the West, the major difference being that its focus is on building interpersonal relations. Pang's et al. also add that 'Guan Xi' is a delicate rule-governed tool.

# 6 Conclusion and Recommendations

This research attempted to examine how national culture creates challenges in hospitality industry and the research focused on expatriate managers operating in hotels in Shanghai, China. The research once again proved that understanding Chinese culture is the key to successful operation in China, as it was already known from secondary data reviewed early. However, certain findings in some ways were surprising and to some extent contrary to expectations.

With regards to challenges expatriate managers face due to cultural differences, lack of initiative from Chinese employees and language barrier were identified to be prevalent. Through the study, it was identified that managers experience substantial difficulties at work due to the language barrier, especially at the beginning, which results in some sort of distance between the managers and subordinates. Lack of initiative and reluctance to take responsibilities, on the other hand, were found to be constant difficulties when managing Chinese employees, as such behaviour is deeply embedded into Chinese mind, due to several cultural factors such as high power distance, collectivist orientation and concept of 'face'. Future expatriate managers who plan to work in China are, therefore, advised to learn about unique Chinese thinking process and be directive when managing Chinese employees, that is being very specific and provide detailed step-by-step instructions when giving directions. Speaking Chinese is also recommended, as it is of a great advantage for foreign managers.

From the literature review, it was expected that expatriate managers meet resistance from local employees, and were expected to 'earn' trust and acceptance into Chinese working environment. However, the research revealed that in general managers do not meet any resistance, and conversely, the Chinese employees are very open and willing to learn from foreigners. This however, results in high expectations for expatriate managers, because they are perceived as experts, who possess extensive knowledge and know how in a given area.

Furthermore, the research determined main motivational factors for the Chinese hotel employees, these are: reward/incentive programmes and acquisition of knowledge. Even though training and development are an effective tool for motivating local staff, it was found that the major motivator for the Chinese is still a reward. Accordingly, it is recommended for expatriate managers to employ a well-organised incentive programme and also ensure that employees are praised and acknowledged for a work well done. The findings, as well, indicated that rewarding individual employees is accepted by the Chinese and does not lead to a confrontation and resistance due to the concept of 'face'.

Moreover, the study has evaluated the importance of 'Guan Xi' for expatriate managers and its utilisation. It was clear that 'Guan Xi' is widely used by the foreigners as well, and they applied to the same rules of this concept. It is suggested that future expatriate managers should be aware of 'Guan Xi' and be expected to establish their personal networks while in China. The participants indicated that it is an openly and widely used way to accomplish various goals in China, and once utilised, expatriate managers are likely to benefit from it.

Although the sample size of the research is small and the study is based on a specific geographical area, namely Shanghai, it is assumed that the findings may also be relevant for other areas of China. This most probably would be appropriate for similar large cosmopolitan cities in China with a high level of development taking place, these locations could include: Beijing, Chongqing, Tianjin, Guangzhou.

To conclude, this research has attempted to contribute new knowledge regarding motivation, importance and utilisation of 'Guan Xi' by expatriate managers. It also aimed at testing previous finding in the subject area, concerning resistance to foreign management and practices.
