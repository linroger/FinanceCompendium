# Dear Shareholders,

Fiscal year 2025 marked a year of solid progress as Alibaba Group advanced our "user first, AI-driven" strategy.

This year, we focused on our two core businesses — e-commerce and “AI + Cloud” — which are the twin engines powering our long-term growth. With AI at the heart of our future, we significantly increased investments in cloud computing and AI infrastructure to accelerate innovation and drive the industrial adoption of AI technologies.

We also made disciplined moves to streamline our portfolio, including the divestiture of non-core assets such as Sun Art and Intime. Meanwhile, we steadily improved operating efficiency across our Internet platform businesses. Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group and Amap, for instance, each achieved a profitable quarter in fiscal year 2025. As AI unlocks new synergies across our diverse ecosystem, we are adopting a group-wide strategy that optimizes holistic value creation.

In the face of historic opportunities brought by AI, we want to share our forward-looking perspective – our strategic positioning, competitive strengths, and how we intend to capture the next wave of growth.

# Strategic Execution and Business Updates

Our first strategic focus, "user first," continues to guide our Internet platform businesses.

With over 1.1 billion Internet users, China is the world's largest online retail market, where e-commerce accounts for nearly  $27%$  of total retail consumption. In China commerce, our Taobao and Tmall Group remained focused on user growth and improving user experience. As China's leading e-commerce platform, we also strengthened the operating environment for merchants, supporting those who offer high-quality products and services. Our efforts to build a sustainable ecosystem that benefits consumers, merchants, and the platform have gained momentum. In fiscal year 2025, we saw a rise in consumer and merchant trust, which in turn fueled business acceleration.

In international commerce, Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) delivered robust revenue growth, driven by the cross-border e-commerce businesses. We enhanced local supply in key markets and diversified our offerings to meet consumer needs across regions worldwide. Operating efficiency continued to improve, and we remain confident in achieving a profitable quarter for our international commerce business in the coming fiscal year.

Our second strategic focus, "AI-driven," reflects our view of AI as both a core driver of business growth and a transformative force for the future. Over the next decade, AI is expected to reshape every industry. At Alibaba, we are investing aggressively in AI infrastructure and frontier innovation to enhance global competitiveness and generate long-term business momentum.

Alibaba Cloud, our core business that is driven by AI, benefited from surging AI demand. Public cloud revenue growth accelerated, and revenue from AI-related products posted triple-digit growth for seven straight quarters, pushing overall revenue to double-digit growth for the fiscal year.

In foundation models, we are expanding the frontier of model capabilities while remaining committed to open-source development. In April 2025, we released our next-generation Qwen3 model, which ranked among the top models globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks. As of the end of April 2025, over 200 models in the Qwen family series had been open-sourced, generating more than 300 million global downloads and over 100,000 derivative models, making Qwen the world's largest open-source model family. These achievements reflect our deep expertise in AI research and will help accelerate the adoption of AI across various industries. We believe our open-source strategy will empower global developers to co-create progress in human intelligence and contribute to the long-term goal of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Across our broader Internet platform ecosystem, we are expanding the application of AI with an open and forward-looking mindset. We believe AI is not only a catalyst for upgrading existing services but also a key to unlocking entirely new user experiences and value.

# Capital Management and Shareholder Return

In fiscal year 2025, Alibaba generated strong cash flow from our core businesses. We improved operating efficiency across multiple platform businesses, strengthening the foundations of previously loss-making businesses, a number of which are now on track to profitability. Our disciplined capital allocation efforts helped unlock shareholder value, including significant capital recovery from the divestment of non-core assets such as Sun Art and Intime. This enables us to double down on our core businesses and invest strategically in AI.

To return value to shareholders, we distributed US$4 billion in annual and special dividends for fiscal year 2024 and have announced a total of US$4.6 billion in dividends for fiscal year 2025. In addition, we repurchased US$11.9 billion of our shares, which resulted in 5.1% net reduction in total outstanding shares, driving accretion in earnings per share.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to enhancing shareholder value through multiple avenues.

# Investing for the Future

The rapid evolution of AI is ushering in sweeping changes across industries and, with it, unprecedented growth opportunities for Alibaba.

Over the next decade, AI will be the primary driver of incremental value and transformation. For Alibaba, this means developing world-class AI models, pushing the limits of model capabilities, and building a globally competitive AI-enabled cloud infrastructure. Together, these capabilities will position "AI + Cloud" as our key growth engine for the future.

To realize this vision, we are ramping up investments in three key areas: AI and cloud infrastructure, AI foundation models and native applications, and the AI-driven transformation of our existing businesses. In fiscal year 2025, we announced that our planned investment in cloud and AI infrastructure over the next three years will exceed the total investment made in the past decade.

In this new era, Alibaba is strategically well-positioned. We are a key player in the China cloud computing market and the top cloud services provider in Asia Pacific. Alibaba Cloud is expanding its global cloud computing infrastructure and scaling international deployment of AI-related products to support the globalization of Chinese enterprises. This presents significant growth potential. With our talent, technology and resources, we are confident in capturing these opportunities and building “AI + Cloud” into Alibaba’s second growth curve.

As the AI era begins, Alibaba must embrace a startup mindset — thinking boldly and acting decisively to capture and create new opportunities. As we shared with our team and their families on Alibaba Day, we want to reiterate this message to our investors: creation, not preservation, is in Alibaba's DNA. Today, Alibaba is embarking on a new chapter in the AI era with the heart of an entrepreneur and the ambition to lead.

We feel a strong responsibility for the continued development of the ecosystem and we take ownership in this development. Accordingly, we refer to this as "our ecosystem." Our ecosystem has strong self-reinforcing network effects benefiting its various participants, who are in turn invested in the growth and success of our ecosystem.

# Our Strategies

In the AI era, digital adoption and transformation of our customers are accelerating across different industries. On the consumer retail side, online shopping is an indispensable sales channel for retailers, while consumers are seeking enhanced and more efficient shopping experience enabled by innovation. For enterprises and organizations, AI technology advancement drives profound industry transformation that changes the way people live and work. AI application provides enterprises and organizations with innovative tools to elevate productivity to a new level.

While such transformation presents tremendous opportunities, it requires us to be more focused, innovative and agile in establishing strategic priorities and strengthening our competitive advantages. To this aim, we have continued to pursue our "user first, AI-driven" strategy and focused on e-commerce and "AI + Cloud", which have demonstrated accelerating growth momentum in the past fiscal year. Looking ahead, we continue to strive to strengthen our leadership and build core capabilities in two strategic areas: consumption and "AI + Cloud."

# E-commerce

Consumption continues to present significant opportunities in China and globally.

China's digital consumption market encompasses diverse value propositions. As a comprehensive consumer platform, Taobao serves a broad and varied consumer base. To further strengthen our competitiveness and tap into new growth potential, we adhere to a "user first" strategy. This involves expanding the platform's offerings of high-quality products and services to meet multi-tiered consumer demands, ultimately delivering a shopping experience defined by quality products, competitive pricing and exceptional service.

We continue to invest in user growth and have increased our focus on competitively priced products, customer service and membership programs, aimed at delivering an exceptional user experience in all aspects. Across our efforts of executing a multi-tiered strategy to cater to all aspects of consumption needs, we view price competitiveness as one of our key value propositions. To make the price of our products more appealing to our consumers, we continue to leverage our position as China's leading e-commerce platform to further improve the efficiency of our service offerings and supply chain capabilities. We strive to improve our consumers' shopping experience via a more reliable and multi-tiered delivery experience. Going forward, we will also continue to invest in key AI capabilities to further improve shopping experience for our consumers.

While enhancing consumer experiences, we are also actively improving the operating environment for merchants on our platform. We are strengthening support for merchants that provide high-quality products and services to consumers and leveraging AI to boost their operating efficiency. Together, we strive to foster a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem for all stakeholders.

Despite evolving complexities in the global macro environment, we remain firmly committed to providing a multi-tiered suite of product and service offerings to our consumers worldwide, and creating growth opportunities for our global merchants and partners. Our core globalization strategies are supported by our robust ecosystem of consumption and technology.

First, we are dedicated to building a leading digitalized global supply chain network. Leveraging our established supply network with a vast variety of product supplies and our global logistics network, we aim to integrate and upgrade the two networks into a digitalized global supply chain network anchored by local merchandise and logistics hubs covering respective overseas markets. We believe that our localized business strategies and tailored product offerings across different countries and regions will enable us to better serve overseas consumers and strengthen our competitive advantage. Second, we will continue to invest in AI and digitalized retail technologies, to unlock operational synergies across different platforms and markets, and further spur innovation for consumer experience. Third, we will focus our efforts in key strategic markets, improve operating efficiency and pursue growth opportunities with ideal return on investments.

# "AI + Cloud"

AI represents a pivotal opportunity for industry transformation. We believe the deep integration of cloud and AI will form the most critical infrastructure that plays a fundamental role in transformation across various industries. The AI era presents tremendous growth opportunities. To capitalize on this, our cloud computing business adheres to an "AI-driven, public cloud first" strategy, aiming to establish a cloud infrastructure network with AI-enabled service capabilities and world-class technological competitiveness, to fuel high-quality future growth.

First, our growth strategy is fundamentally driven by our AI technological capabilities, with AI foundation models playing an important role in transforming industry productivity. We will continue to invest in proprietary AI foundation models to maintain

technological leadership, while expanding our open-source initiatives to build a thriving open-source ecosystem around Qwen. We aim to promote AI application and innovation among global developers, startups and enterprises across diverse industries, fostering a prosperous AI ecosystem through collaboration.

The computational demands of large-scale AI models require reliable cloud infrastructure for optimal efficiency, creating clear and massive demand for cloud services in the AI era. We will continue to invest in AI and cloud infrastructure. We remain committed to building a reliable, efficient and globally distributed AI infrastructure network that empowers our customers and ecosystem partners to capture growth opportunities in the AI era.

Second, we will prioritize growth initiatives in our public cloud core business. We believe that, by scaling our public cloud business, we will not only be able to improve the quality of revenues in the short term but also benefit from economies of scale in the long run. Therefore, we will continue to invest into the core products of public cloud offerings to further improve the quality of revenues.

In addition, we believe there are significant opportunities to be captured outside China by addressing the cloud services needs of international customers and Chinese customers expanding overseas. Leveraging our proven expertise from the Chinese market, we strive to offer industry-leading and cost-effective technologies and products that are competitive on the global stage. Looking ahead, to deliver tailored, customer-centric support to global enterprises and organizations, we will further expand the coverage of our global infrastructure network and localized support teams, accelerate the establishment of a global cloud computing network and promote the globalization of AI-related products. We believe that our continued commitment to long-term growth and investment in overseas markets will unlock incremental growth opportunities for us.

# - Products and Services

We believe our ecosystem offers the most comprehensive range of products and services among global commerce platforms to meet the diverse demands of our massive and diversified consumer base across different segments.

Leveraging our product and supply chain capabilities, consumers can enjoy a broad variety of quality products, such as branded products, imported goods, products sourced directly from manufacturers and farms as well as idle goods.

comprehensive delivery options include on-demand delivery, half-day delivery, same-or next-day delivery and next-day pick-up services, which capture the varying needs of consumers living in large cities and less-developed areas. Our key businesses are:

Taobao and Tmall

Taobao means "search for treasure" in Chinese. Taobao serves as the starting point and destination portal for many users' shopping journey and provides a top-level traffic funnel that directs users to the various marketplaces, channels and features within our ecosystem. Through the Taobao app, consumers can also access display listings from Tmall merchants and brands, as well as our various other marketplaces. Consumers from both large cities and less-developed areas come to Taobao to enjoy an engaging and personalized shopping experience, optimized by our data analytics and technology.

Tmall caters to consumers' demand for high-quality products and premium shopping experience. A large number of international and Chinese brands and retailers have established storefronts on Tmall. Tmall is the partner of choice for brands. Brands and retailers operate their own storefronts on Tmall with unique brand identities and look and feel, accompanied by full control over their own branding and merchandising. Because of the presence of a large number of brands and the stringent standards required for merchants, brands and retailers to join and operate on Tmall, a presence on Tmall has become a validation of quality, allowing merchants, brands and retailers to take advantage of our significant traffic to extend and build brand awareness and customer engagement. Major international brands that have physical operations in China are well represented on Tmall.

o Tmall Global

Tmall Global addresses the increasing demand of consumers in China for international products and brands. Tmall Global serves as the premier platform through which overseas brands and retailers reach consumers in China, build brand awareness and gain valuable consumer insights to form their overall China strategies, without the need for physical operations in China. We believe Tmall Global is a leading import e-commerce platform in China.

o Tmall Supermarket

By leveraging our technology capabilities and consumer insights, Tmall Supermarket facilitates the digital transformation of its offline partners, enhancing their supply chain management capabilities.

# Consumer and Merchant Experience

We aim to provide an immersive and personalized shopping experience with engaging content and quality service to our consumers. The massive amount of user and merchant activities taking place every day on our China commerce retail platforms generate significant consumer insights. By leveraging proprietary AI and data technologies, we are able to aggregate and build on deep consumer insights to provide more accurate search results and relevant recommendation feeds that enhance the shopping experience for our consumers. Our various commerce platforms also enable merchants to engage with consumers through a variety of formats, including livestreaming, short-form videos, interactive games and microblogs. We continue to introduce interactive features and innovative formats to facilitate user engagement with brands, merchants and content creators. Along with these features and formats, our relevant and engaging entertainment content plays an important role in consumers' product discovery process and shopping journey, and drives user stickiness and retention on our various platforms. In addition, we adopted a more open approach for payment and logistics services to make shopping on our platform more convenient to a larger base of consumers as part of our commitment to providing consumers with quality services which we believe is key to our "user first" strategy.

On the merchant end, we focus on improving their operating environment and help them enhance efficiency. Merchants, brands and retailers turn to Taobao and Tmall not only for their broad user base, but also for their consumer insights and technology. Taobao and Tmall have driven the digitalization and transformation of merchants, brands and retailers by enabling them to digitalize their operations, engage, acquire and retain consumers, increase brand recognition, innovate product offerings, manage supply chains and enhance operating efficiency. In particular, Taobao and Tmall offer a variety of one-stop brand marketing and promotional products to help merchants, brands and retailers quickly acquire new users, launch new products and to improve conversions. Merchants, brands and retailers can easily create storefronts and listings on Taobao and Tmall.

We provide merchants with diversified marketing services to enhance their business performance. Taobao and Tmall merchants can purchase P4P, in-feed marketing and display marketing and software services to direct traffic to their storefronts. In addition, merchants can acquire additional traffic from third-party marketing affiliates to further expand their reach. In fiscal year 2025, we launched our new AI-empowered platform-wide marketing tool, Quanzhantui, which features automated bidding, optimized targeting and performance dashboard visualization. We have seen increasing penetration of Quanzhantui due to its convenience of use and improvement of marketing efficiency. Additionally, to ensure merchant's sustainable development on our platform, we implemented a series of merchant-friendly measures such as "Tuihuobao (a subscription service to improve the return process)" to reduce their cost and support their long-term growth.

# Cloud Intelligence Group

Alibaba Group is the world's fourth largest and Asia Pacific's largest Infrastructure-as-a-service provider by revenue in 2024 in U.S. dollars, according to Gartner April 2025 report (Source: Gartner®, "Market Share: Services, Worldwide, 2024", Neha Sethi et al., 11 April 2025, Sorted by Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Vendor Revenue Basis) (Asia Pacific refers to Mature Asia/Pacific, China (Region), Emerging Asia/Pacific and Japan (Region), and market share refers to that of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)). Alibaba Group is also China's largest provider of public cloud services by revenue in 2024, including PaaS and IaaS services, according to IDC (Source: IDC Semiannual Public Cloud Service Tracker, (2024Q4)). China's cloud computing industry is still at an early stage of development. In 2024, the revenue of China's public cloud service market, including IaaS, PaaS and SaaS markets, only accounted for  $0.2%$  of China's GDP, which is significantly lower than that of the U.S. and indicates tremendous room for growth. The industry has experienced significant growth in recent years with increasing adoption of both infrastructure services and value-added services by enterprises.

The technologies that power Cloud Intelligence Group originally grew out of the massive scale and complexity of the needs of our China commerce businesses, which encompass commerce, payments and logistics. Leveraging our full-stack cloud capabilities and proprietary products portfolio, Cloud Intelligence Group offers a comprehensive suite of cloud services based on a three-tiered architecture of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and model-as-a-service (MaaS) to customers worldwide. These services not only enable our customers to build a flexible, scalable, affordable and secure technology infrastructure, but also equip them with leading data capabilities that efficiently handle complex management, analytics and machine learning tasks, thereby generating significant business insights and enabling intelligent business decisions and operations. We leverage these capabilities and technologies to support our ecosystem and provide our customers across various verticals with industry-specific solutions, including those for commerce, financial services and industrial applications. In addition, as part of our globalization strategy, Cloud Intelligence Group continued to expand our international cloud computing infrastructure to better serve our customers' needs in overseas markets. As of March 31, 2025, Cloud Intelligence Group offered computing services in 34 regions globally.

Cloud Intelligence Group has achieved significant advances in model-as-a-service (MaaS), by leveraging its robust foundation in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS). Cloud Intelligence Group has built a comprehensive MaaS ecosystem, with Alibaba Cloud model studio (Bailian) and ModelScope at its core. Through Bailian platform, Cloud Intelligence Group provides high-performance, cost-effective model platform services to customers, supporting the training, fine-tuning and inference of large-scale models, including its proprietary Qwen model series. In fiscal year 2025, Bailian recorded rapid user growth. We believe ModelScope is China's largest AI model community in terms of number of models available, that aggregates a vast number of AI models and users.

Alibaba's Qwen model series have achieved significant milestones in terms of performance, functionality and ecosystem development. Qwen has open-sourced a suite of models, encompassing a full spectrum of scale and multi-modal capabilities and supporting 119 languages and dialects. We believe the open-source strategy has empowered the Qwen model series to become the largest AI model family worldwide in terms of number of derivative models, with many derivative models ranking among the top performers in internationally recognized benchmarks. In April 2025, we launched the Qwen3 series, a new generation of hybrid reasoning models that combine the capabilities of fast, simple responses and deeper chain-of-thought reasoning into a single model. The Qwen3 series are fully open sourced and covers a full range of model sizes, ranking amongst the top performers globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks. These achievements further solidify Cloud Intelligence Group's leading position in the global AI and cloud computing industry.

Our self-developed distributed deep learning platform, Platform for AI (PAI), and our Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service adopt leading software-hardware integrated optimization technology, which feature large-scale cluster scalability, as well as outstanding acceleration ratio and stability in large model training. PAI supports the fine-tuning and deployment of mainstream open-source large models, provides a serverless service mode and offers various inference efficiency optimization solutions.

Our data centers utilize a leading distributed fault-tolerant architecture, advanced self-developed power and cooling equipment, AI-driven intelligent monitoring and operation technologies to provide reliable support, with high elasticity and high-density capabilities, to our intelligent computing business. Combined with a high proportion of clean energy use, our data centers provide stable, secure, efficient, agile, and green infrastructure services.

# Artificial Intelligence

Alibaba's Qwen model series have achieved significant milestones in terms of performance, functionality and ecosystem development. Qwen has open-sourced a suite of models, encompassing a full spectrum of scale and multi-modal capabilities and supporting 119 languages and dialects. We believe the open-source strategy has empowered the Qwen model series to become the largest AI model family worldwide in terms of number of derivative models, with many derivative models ranking among the top performers in internationally recognized benchmarks. In April 2025, we launched the Qwen3 series, a new generation of hybrid reasoning models that combine the capabilities of fast, simple responses and deeper chain-of-thought reasoning into a single model. The Qwen3 series are fully open sourced and covers a full range of model sizes, ranking amongst the top performers globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks. These achievements further solidify Cloud Intelligence Group's leading position in the global AI and cloud computing industry.

Our self-developed distributed deep learning platform PAI and our Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service adopt leading software-hardware integrated optimization technology, which feature large-scale cluster scalability, as well as outstanding acceleration ratio and stability in large model training. PAI supports the fine-tuning and deployment of mainstream open-source large models, provides a serverless service mode, and offers various inference efficiency optimization solutions.

# Technology Infrastructure

Our data centers utilize a leading distributed fault-tolerant architecture, advanced self-developed power and cooling equipment, AI-driven intelligent monitoring and operation technologies to provide reliable support, with high elasticity and high-density capabilities, to our intelligent computing business. Combined with a high proportion of clean energy use, our data centers provide stable, secure, efficient, agile, and green infrastructure services.

# Cloud Operating System

Apsara (our proprietary general-purpose distributed computing operating system), inclusive of ShenlongCompute (our hardware virtualization architecture), Pangu (our distributed cloud storage system) and Luoshen (our cloud network structure), provide Cloud Intelligence Group's customers and our core businesses with enhanced computing power, accelerated computation, storage and network capabilities to support their and our business growth in the new technology era.

# Competition

We face competition principally from established Chinese Internet companies and their respective affiliates, global and regional e-commerce players, cloud computing service providers, logistics service providers and digital media and entertainment providers. These competitors generate significant traffic and have established strong brand recognition, robust technological capabilities and significant financial resources. The areas in which we compete primarily include:
- Consumers. We compete to attract, engage and retain consumers based on the variety, quality and value of products and services listed on our platforms, the engagement of digital media and entertainment content available on our platforms, the overall user experience of our products and services, and the effectiveness of our consumer protection measures.
- Merchants, Brands, Retailers and other Businesses. We compete to attract and retain merchants, brands and retailers based on the size and the engagement of consumers on our platforms and the effectiveness of our products and services to help them build brand awareness and engagement, acquire and retain customers, complete transactions, expand service capabilities, protect intellectual property rights and enhance operating efficiency. In addition, we compete to attract and retain businesses of different sizes across various industries based on the effectiveness of our cloud service offerings to help them enhance operating efficiency and realize their digitalization transformation ambitions.
- Marketers. We compete to attract and retain marketers, publishers and demand-side platforms operated by agencies based on the reach and engagement of our properties, the depth of our consumer insights and the effectiveness of our branding and marketing solutions.
  Cloud Infrastructure Users. We compete to attract and retain enterprises, developers and organizations by offering reliable, scalable and high-performance cloud infrastructure, and AI-powered solutions to accelerate their digital transformation, reduce operational costs and grow business
- Talent. We compete for motivated and capable talent, including engineers and product developers to build compelling apps, tools, and functions and to provide services for all participants in our ecosystem.

If international players gain greater access to the China market, certain of our business could be subject to greater competition. As we acquire new businesses and expand into new industries and sectors, we face competition from major players in these industries and sectors. In addition, as we continue to expand into markets outside of China, we increasingly face competition from domestic and international players operating in these markets. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected."

# Seasonality

Our overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including seasonal factors and economic cycles that influence consumer spending as well as promotions.

Historically, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations mainly in our commerce businesses. Our China commerce businesses typically record the highest levels of revenues in the fourth calendar quarter of each year due to a number of factors, including merchants allocating a significant portion of their online marketing budgets to the fourth calendar quarter, promotions, and the impact of seasonal buying patterns in respect of certain merchandise categories such as apparel. We also typically record lower levels of revenues in the first calendar quarter of each year due to a lower level of allocation of marketing budgets by merchants early in the calendar year and during the Chinese New Year holiday, during which time consumers generally spend less and businesses in China are generally closed. Our international commerce businesses are also subject to seasonal fluctuations depending on the markets we operate in.

# Property, Plant and Equipment

As of March 31, 2025, we occupied facilities around the world with an aggregate gross floor area of office buildings, logistics warehouses, retail space, data centers and other facilities owned by us totaling approximately 18.3 million square meters. We maintain offices in many countries and regions, including Chinese mainland, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore and the United States. In addition, we maintain data centers in a number of countries including Chinese mainland, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, UAE, Germany, the UK, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and the United States.

# Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations

Our Ability to Create Value for Our Users and Generate Revenue. Our ability to create value for our users and generate revenue is driven by the factors described below:
- Number and engagement of consumers. Consumers are attracted to our platforms by the breadth of curated products and services, personalized content and the interactive user experience these platforms offer. Our platforms include a comprehensive selection of product and service offerings as well as engaging content, such as recommendation feeds on our Taobao app and entertainment content on Youku. Consumers enjoy an engaging social experience by interacting with each other and with merchants, brands and KOLs on our platforms. We leverage our consumer insights to further optimize the relevance of this rich content we provide to our users. The engagement of consumers in our ecosystem is affected by our ability to continue to enhance and expand our product and service offerings and improve user experience.
- Broader value offered to merchants, brands, retailers and other businesses. Merchants, brands, retailers and other businesses use our products and services to help them reach, acquire and retain customers, build brand awareness and engagement, complete transactions, and enhance their operating efficiency. We offer merchants and retailers a complete suite of services and tools, powered by our consumer insights, to help them effectively engage consumers, efficiently manage their operations and provide a seamless online and offline consumer experience. With our proprietary data and technologies, we also facilitate the digital transformation of traditional merchants and retailers. In addition, we empower businesses of different sizes across various industries through our comprehensive “AI + Cloud” service offerings.
- Empowering data and technology. Our ability to engage consumers and empower merchants, brands, retailers and other businesses is affected by the breadth and depth of our consumer insights, such as the accuracy of our shopping recommendations and of our targeted marketing, and our technology capabilities and infrastructure, such as cloud computing, and our continued ability to develop scalable products and services that adapt to the quickly evolving industry trends and consumer preferences.
- Cloud infrastructure adoption. Our ability to attract and retain cloud infrastructure customers and expand our offerings depends on our ability to enhance cloud and AI service capabilities, and demonstrate superior performance compared to other providers. We offer reliable large-scale cloud infrastructure, advanced large models, and comprehensive scenario-based solutions to meet diverse customer needs.

Operating Leverage of Our Business Model. Our primary business model has significant operating leverage and our ecosystem enables us to realize structural cost savings. For example, Taobao drives significant traffic to Tmall as Tmall product listings also appear on Taobao search result pages. Furthermore, the large number of consumers on our marketplaces attracts a large number of merchants, who become customers for our customer management and storefront services. In addition, the vast consumer base of our ecosystem presents cross-selling opportunities across our various platforms. For example, we can offer consumer services, such as [Ele.me](http://Ele.me), and promote our digital media and entertainment services, including Youku, to consumers on our marketplaces. These network effects allow for lower traffic acquisition costs and provide synergies across our businesses.

Our Investment in User Base, Technology, People, Infrastructure, and Innovative Business Model. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our platforms and ecosystem to attract consumers, merchants and enterprises, enhance user experience and expand the capabilities and scope of our platforms. We expect our investments will include expanding our China and international offerings, implementing our local consumer service businesses, strengthening our logistics and fulfillment capabilities, enhancing our Cloud business, developing cloud computing and AI infrastructure, investing in content and user acquisition to further develop our digital media and entertainment business, cultivating innovation initiatives and new technologies as well as executing our globalization strategy. Our operating leverage and profitability enable us to continue to invest in our people, particularly engineers, scientists and product management personnel, as well as in our technology capabilities and infrastructure. Our investment in the above-mentioned new and existing businesses has and will continue to lower our margins but we believe the investment will deliver overall long-term growth.

Strategic Investments and Acquisitions. We have made, and intend to make, strategic investments and acquisitions. Our investment and acquisition strategy focuses on strengthening our core businesses and new growth opportunities. We also evaluate and explore potential divestment opportunities for certain of our non-core businesses from time to time. Our strategic investments and acquisitions may adversely affect our future financial results, including our margins and our net income, at least in the short term. In addition, some of our acquisitions and investments may not be successful. We have incurred impairment charges in the past and may incur impairment charges in the future.

# Recent Investments, Acquisitions, Dispositions and Strategic Alliance Activities

In addition to organic growth, we have made, or have entered into agreements to make, strategic investments, acquisitions and alliances that are intended to further our strategic objectives. The financial results for these strategic transactions that were completed are reflected in our operating results beginning with the period of their respective completion. Investments in which we did not obtain control are generally accounted for under the equity method if we have significant influence over the investee through investment in common stock or in-substance common stock. Otherwise, investments are generally carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements or accounted for using the measurement alternative based on our accounting policies over different categories of investments. For the details of our accounting policies for each category of our investments, see notes 2(d), 2(t) and 2(u) to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

We have developed focused investment strategies, targeting to invest, acquire or form alliances that will either complement our existing businesses or drive innovation initiatives. In some cases, we may take a staged approach to our investment and acquisition strategy, by beginning with an initial minority investment followed by business cooperation. When the business results, cooperation and the overall relationship established with the management of the investee company show increasing value to our ongoing business strategy, we may increase our investment or acquire the investee company completely. On the other hand, we have been optimizing our balance sheet through strategic divestments of non-core assets, and focusing on growing our core businesses, improving return on capital and enhancing shareholder value.

We have funded our strategic acquisitions and investments primarily from cash generated from our operations and through debt and equity financing. Our debt financing primarily consists of unsecured senior notes and bank borrowings, including an aggregate of US $8.0 billion unsecured senior notes issued in November 2014, of which US$ 7.3 billion was repaid in 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2024, an aggregate of US$7.0 billion unsecured senior notes issued in December 2017, of which US$0.7 billion was repaid in June 2023, an aggregate of US$5.0 billion unsecured senior notes issued in February 2021, an aggregate of US$5.0 billion convertible unsecured senior notes issued in May 2024, an aggregate of US$2.65 billion and RMB17 billion (US$2.3 billion) unsecured senior notes issued in November 2024, a five-year term loan facility of US$4.0 billion drawn down in fiscal year 2017, the maturity of which has been extended to May 2024 in May 2019 and has been further extended to May 2028 in July 2023, and US$830 million of the loan was repaid in January 2025, as well as a US$6.5 billion revolving credit facility which we have not yet drawn. Going forward, we expect to fund additional investments through cash generated from our operations and through debt and equity financing when opportunities arise in the future. Although we expect our margins to be negatively affected by acquisitions of target companies with lower or negative margins, we do not expect our investment activities to have any significant negative impact on our liquidity or operations. We believe acquired businesses operating at a loss do not detract from our total value because they bring clear strategic value to us in the long run. However, there can be no assurance that our future financial results would not be materially and adversely affected if our strategic investments and acquisitions are not successful. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — Sustained investment in our businesses and our focus on long-term performance and maintaining the health of our ecosystem may negatively affect our margins and our net income” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We face risks relating to our acquisitions, investments and alliances.”

# Significant Investment Held

Our significant investment consists of Ant Group. Ant Group provides comprehensive digital payment services and facilitates digital financial and value-added services for consumers and merchants in China and across the world. As of March 31, 2025, our equity interest in Ant Group on a fully diluted basis was  $33%$ . During the year ended March 31, 2025, dividend received from Ant Group amounted to RMB2,630 million (US$362 million).

We did not hold any other significant investments as of March 31, 2025.

# Material Investments, Acquisitions and Dispositions

Our material investments, acquisitions and dispositions in fiscal year 2025 and the period through the date of this annual report are set forth below.

In December 2024, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell all of the equity interest in Sun Art Retail Group Limited ("Sun Art") held by us, representing approximately (73.66%) of the total number of the ordinary shares of Sun Art in issue. Pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement, we were entitled to receive approximately HK\(9,698 million (US\)1,247 million), which comprised of cash considerations of approximately HK\(6,465 million (US\)831 million) and deferred cash considerations of approximately HK\(3,233 million (US\)416 million). Interest shall be payable in connection with the deferred cash considerations, consisting of (i) base interest, accrued at (4.80%) per annum, compounded annually, and (ii) the variable interest of maximum HK\(873 million, in the event that the 2027/2028 average adjusted EBITDA of Sun Art is higher than or equal to the adjusted EBITDA high limit of RMB4,400 million. The sale of Sun Art was completed as of March 31, 2025 and we received approximately HK\)6,465 million (US\(831 million) in cash considerations.

In December 2024, we together with another minority shareholder agreed to sell  $100%$  of the equity interest in Intime Retail (Group) Company Limited ("Intime") to a consortium of purchasers. We held approximately  $99%$  of the equity interest in Intime. The cash consideration to us from the sale of Intime is approximately RMB7.4 billion (US$1.0 billion). The sale of Intime was substantially completed as of March 31, 2025.

As of the date of this annual report, we did not have detailed future plans for material investments, although from time to time, we may be evaluating potential opportunities for investments, acquisitions and dispositions, including opportunities that may be significant.

# Intangible Assets and Goodwill

When we make an acquisition, consideration that exceeds the acquisition date amounts of the acquired assets and liabilities is allocated to intangible assets and goodwill. We have and will continue to incur amortization expenses as we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. We do not amortize goodwill. We test intangible assets and goodwill periodically or whenever necessary for impairment, and any impairment may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Some of our acquisitions and investments may not be successful, and we may incur impairment charges in the future. We recognized an impairment of intangible assets of RMB12,084 million in fiscal year 2024, which was relating to Sun Art within All others segment, and RMB634 million (US$87 million) in fiscal year 2025, which was mainly relating to our businesses within All others segment. We recognized an impairment of goodwill of RMB10,521 million and RMB6,171 million (US$850 million) in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 respectively, mainly in relation to Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group. For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Impairment Assessment on Goodwill and Intangible Assets” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We face risks relating to our acquisitions, investments and alliances.”

 (1) During fiscal year 2024, our segment reporting has been updated to reflect our Reorganization and the reclassification of the revenue of our DingTalk business, which was previously reported under Cloud Intelligence Group, to All others, the purpose of which was to provide DingTalk with greater autonomy to promote innovation and enhance competitiveness. Our CODM started to review information under this new reporting structure and segment reporting has been updated to conform to this change as well as the way we manage and monitor segment performance. Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.
(2) Direct sales and others revenue under Taobao and Tmall Group primarily represents Tmall Supermarket, Tmall Global and other direct sales businesses, where revenue and cost of inventory are recorded on a gross basis, as well as other revenue from logistics services and other value-added services.
(3) All others include Freshippo, Alibaba Health, Lingxi Games, Intelligent Information Platform (which mainly consists of UCWeb and Quark businesses), Fliggy, DingTalk (previously reported under Cloud Intelligence Group segment), Sun Art, Intime and other businesses. The majority of revenue within All others consist of direct sales revenue, which is recorded on a gross basis.

See “— Our Monetization Model” for additional information regarding our revenue.

# Cost of Revenue

The principal components of our cost of revenue include: cost of inventories; logistics costs; expenses associated with the operation of our mobile platforms and websites, such as depreciation and maintenance expenses for our servers and computers, call centers and other equipment, as well as bandwidth and co-location fees; salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense relating to customer service, mobile platform and platform operation personnel as well as payment processing consultants; traffic acquisition costs paid to third-party marketing affiliates either at a fixed price or on a revenue-sharing basis; content acquisition costs paid to third parties and production costs of original content for our online media properties; payment processing fees paid to Alipay or other financial institutions; and other miscellaneous costs.

# Product Development Expenses

Product development expenses primarily include salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense for research and development personnel and other expenses that are directly attributable to the development of new technologies and products for our businesses, such as the development of the technology and Internet infrastructure, applications, operating systems, software, databases and networks.

# Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of online and offline advertising expenses, promotion expenses, salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in sales and marketing functions, and sales commissions paid for membership and user acquisition for our marketplaces and platforms.

# General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense for our management and administrative employees, office facilities and other support overhead costs, professional services fees, provision for doubtful debts on receivables, charitable contributions, as well as non-recurring items.

# Interest and Investment Income, Net

Interest and investment income, net mainly consists of interest income, gain or loss on deemed disposals, disposals and revaluation of our long-term equity investments and impairment of equity investments.

# Interest Expense

Our interest expense is comprised of interest payments and amortization of upfront fees and incidental charges primarily associated with our US $8.0 billion unsecured senior notes issued in November 2014, of which US$ 7.3 billion was repaid in 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2024, an aggregate of US$7.0 billion unsecured senior notes issued in December 2017, of which US$0.7 billion was repaid in June 2023, an aggregate of US$5.0 billion unsecured senior notes issued in February 2021, an aggregate of US$5.0 billion convertible unsecured senior notes issued in May 2024, an aggregate of US$2.65 billion U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured senior notes and RMB17 billion (US$2.3 billion) RMB-denominated unsecured senior notes issued in November 2024, as well as the US$4.0 billion five-year term loan facility drawn down in fiscal year 2017 and extended in 2023. In addition, we have a US$6.5 billion revolving credit facility, which we have not yet drawn as of the date of this annual report.

# Other Income, Net

Other income, net, primarily consists of input VAT super-credit, exchange gain or loss and government grants. Exchange gain or loss, arising from our operations and treasury management activities, recognized in our income statement is largely affected by exchange rate fluctuation among Renminbi, U.S. dollar and Turkish lira. Government grants primarily relate to grants by central and local governments in connection with our contributions to technology development and investments in local business districts. These grants may not be recurring in nature, and we recognize the income when the grants are received and no further conditions need to be met.

# Share-based Compensation

We provide share-based awards to eligible grantees and believe share-based awards are vital to attract, incentivize and retain our employees and are the appropriate tool to align the interests of the grantees with those of our shareholders. For further information about the equity incentive plans of our Company, see "Directors, Senior Management and Employees — Compensation."

In addition, prior to 2023, Junhan and Ant Group granted share-based awards to our employees, and the awards are settled by Junhan or Ant Group respectively. See "Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions — Related Party Transactions — Agreements and Transactions Related to Ant Group and Its Subsidiaries — Our Commercial Arrangements with Ant Group and Alipay — Share-based Award Arrangements."

We recognized share-based compensation expense of RMB30,831 million, RMB18,546 million and RMB15,577 million (US$2,147 million) in fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, representing 4%, 2% and 2% of our revenue in those respective periods.

Share-based compensation expense decreased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of the awards granted and the increase in long-term cash incentives granted after considering the macroeconomic environment and the general trends in the talent market.

Share-based compensation expense related to Ant Group share-based awards was a net reversal in fiscal year 2024 because we made a mark-to-market adjustment during the fiscal year relating to Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees, reflecting a decrease in the value of Ant Group.

We expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in the fair value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future. See “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Share-based Compensation Expense and Valuation of the Underlying Awards” below for additional information regarding our share-based compensation expense.

# Non-GAAP Measures

We use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow, each a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.

We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. We present three different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income in order to provide more information and greater transparency to investors about our operating results.

We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.

Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from operations, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expenses, share of results of equity method investees, certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, and operating lease cost relating to land use rights, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented.

# Management Discussion and Analysis

Adjusted EBITA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expenses, share of results of equity method investees, certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented.

Non-GAAP net income represents net income before non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, gain or loss on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, impairment of goodwill and investments, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business), and adjustments for the tax effects.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets (excluding those acquired through acquisitions), as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the buyer protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from investing activities in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating business operations. We exclude "acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses" because the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and are not directly related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude buyer protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of compensating buyers for claims against merchants.

Total revenue increased by  $6%$  from RMB941,168 million in fiscal year 2024 to RMB996,347 million (US$137,300 million) in fiscal year 2025.

Revenue from our International commerce retail business in fiscal year 2025 was RMB108,465 million (US$14,947 million), increased by  $33%$  compared to RMB81,654 million in fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by the increase in revenue contributed by AliExpress and Trendyol. Of which, the year-over-year growth was mainly driven by revenue growth contributed by AliExpress and Trendyol of  $25%$  and  $8%$ , respectively, to the total increase of  $33%$ . As certain of our international businesses generate revenue in local currencies while our reporting currency is Renminbi, AIDC's revenue is affected by exchange rate fluctuations.

Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited adjusted EBITA decreased by  $78%$  to RMB302 million (US$41 million) in fiscal year 2025, compared to RMB1,402 million in fiscal year 2024, primarily due to the decrease in profits from cross-border fulfillment solutions.

Adjusted EBITA from All others segment in fiscal year 2025 was a loss of RMB8,536 million (US$1,176 million), compared to a loss of RMB9,160 million in fiscal year 2024, primarily due to improved operating results from Sun Art, Freshippo and Alibaba Health, partly offset by the increased investment in technology businesses.

Our cost of revenue increased by  $2%$  from RMB586,323 million in fiscal year 2024 to RMB598,285 million (US$82,446 million) in fiscal year 2025. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue would have decreased from  $62%$  in fiscal year 2024 to  $60%$  in fiscal year 2025. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decrease in scale of low margin direct sales businesses, and improvement in monetization and operating efficiency.

Our product development expenses increased by  $9%$  from RMB52,256 million in fiscal year 2024 to RMB57,151 million (US$7,876 million) in fiscal year 2025.

Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue would have increased from  $12%$  in fiscal year 2024 to  $14%$  in fiscal year 2025. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to our increased investments in e-commerce businesses.

Our general and administrative expenses increased by  $5%$  from RMB41,985 million in fiscal year 2024 to RMB44,239 million (US$6,096 million) in fiscal year 2025. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue would have remained stable at  $4%$  in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024.

Amortization and impairment of intangible assets decreased by  $71%$  from RMB21,592 million in fiscal year 2024 to RMB6,336 million (US$873 million) in fiscal year 2025. During fiscal year 2025, impairment of intangible assets of RMB634 million (US$87 million) was recorded mainly relating to our businesses within All others segment. During fiscal year 2024, an impairment of intangible assets of RMB12,084 million was recorded relating to Sun Art within All others segment.

# Impairment of goodwill

Impairment of goodwill in fiscal year 2025 was RMB6,171 million (US$850 million), decreased by 41% or RMB4,350 million from RMB10,521 million in fiscal year 2024. Impairment recorded for both years were mainly related to Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group and All others segment.

 Our income from operations increased by (24%) from RMB113,350 million, or (12%) of revenue, in fiscal year 2024 to RMB140,905 million (US\(19,417 million), or (14%) of revenue, in fiscal year 2025. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, the decrease in non-cash share-based compensation expense and the increase in adjusted EBITA.

# Interest and Investment Income, Net

Interest and investment income, net in fiscal year 2025 was a gain of RMB20,759 million (US$2,861 million), compared to a loss of RMB9,964 million in fiscal year 2024, primarily due to the mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and the decrease in impairment of our investments, partly offset by the losses arising from the disposal of subsidiaries.

# Other Income, Net

Other income, net in fiscal year 2025 was RMB3,387 million (US$467 million), compared to RMB6,157 million in fiscal year 2024, primarily due to change in input VAT super-credit rate from 5% to 0% in calendar year 2024.

# Income Tax Expenses

Income tax expenses in fiscal year 2025 were RMB35,445 million (US$4,884 million), compared to RMB22,529 million in fiscal year 2024.

# Share of Results of Equity Method Investees

Share of results of equity method investees in fiscal year 2025 was a profit of RMB5,966 million (US$822 million), compared to a loss of RMB7,735 million in fiscal year 2024.

 We record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. The year-over-year increase in share of profit of Ant Group was mainly attributable to an increase in fair value of certain investments, partly offset by the investments in new growth initiatives.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, Ant Group repurchased approximately  $7%$  equity interest from its existing shareholders and the shares repurchased were allocated to the employee incentive plans of Ant Group. The number of shares held by us in Ant Group remains unchanged from a legal perspective, and our equity interest in Ant Group on a fully diluted basis remains unchanged at  $33%$ .

For accounting purposes, we will take into consideration a proportionate share of equity interest held by the employee incentive plans of Ant Group to account for our share of results from our investment in Ant Group, subject to dilution as the equity interest under the employee incentive plans of Ant Group is transferred out.

# Net Income

Our net income in fiscal year 2025 was RMB125,976 million (US$17,360 million), increased by 77% or RMB54,644 million, compared to RMB71,332 million in fiscal year 2024. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and the increase in income from operations, partly offset by the losses arising from the disposal of subsidiaries.

For the year ended March 31, 2023, the cash transfer from our subsidiaries to the parent amounting to RMB112,153 million, of which RMB75,355 million, RMB20,565 million and RMB16,233 million were included in the parent's net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively.

For the year ended March 31, 2023, the cash transfer from the major VIEs and their subsidiaries to our subsidiaries and consolidated entities amounting to RMB14,172 million, of which RMB6,513 million and RMB7,659 million were included in the major VIEs and their subsidiaries' net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities, respectively.

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

We fund our operations and strategic investments from cash generated from our operations and through debt and equity financing. We generated RMB199,752 million, RMB182,593 million and RMB163,509 million (US$22,532 million) of cash from operating activities for fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. As of March 31, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments of RMB597,132 million (US$82,287 million) that are unrestricted for withdrawal and use. Short-term investments include investments in fixed deposits with original maturities between three months and one year and certain investments in wealth management products, certificates of deposit, marketable debt securities and other investments whereby we have the intention to redeem within one year. Other treasury investments mainly include investments in fixed deposits, certificates of deposit and marketable debt securities with original maturities over one year for treasury purposes. The remaining maturities of these treasury investments held by us generally range from one to five years.

In November 2014, we issued unsecured senior notes, including floating rate and fixed rate notes, with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of US $8.0 billion. Interest on the unsecured senior notes is payable in arrears, quarterly for the floating rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed rate notes. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the unsecured senior notes to refinance our previous syndicated loan arrangements in the same amount. In November 2017, November 2019, November 2021 and November 2024, we repaid US$ 7.3 billion of our US$8.0 billion unsecured senior notes that became due. We are not subject to any financial covenant or other significant operating covenants under the unsecured senior notes. See note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information on unsecured senior notes.

In March 2016, we signed a five-year US $3.0 billion syndicated loan agreement with a group of eight lead arrangers, which we subsequently drew down in April 2016. The loan was upsized from US$ 3.0 billion to US$4.0 billion in May 2016 through a general syndication and the upsized portion was subsequently drawn down in August 2016. The loan had a five-year bullet maturity and was priced at 110 basis points over LIBOR. In May 2019, we amended the pricing of the loan to 85 basis points over LIBOR and extended the maturity to May 2024. We further amended the pricing of the loan to 80 basis points over SOFR with a credit adjustment spread in May 2023 and extended the maturity to May 2028 in July 2023. The use of proceeds of the loan is for general corporate and working capital purposes (including funding our acquisitions). In January 2025, we repaid US$830 million of the loan.

In April 2017, we entered into a revolving credit facility agreement with certain financial institutions for an amount of US$5.15 billion, which we did not draw down during the availability period. The interest rate for this credit facility was calculated based on LIBOR plus 95 basis points. This loan facility is reserved for future general corporate and working capital purposes (including funding our acquisitions). In June 2021, the terms of this facility were amended and the amount of the credit facility was increased to US$6.5 billion. The expiration date of the credit facility was extended to June 2026. Under the terms of the amended facility, the interest rate on any outstanding utilized amount was calculated based on LIBOR plus 80 basis points. In May 2023, we amended the pricing of the outstanding utilized amount to SOFR with a credit adjustment spread plus 80 basis points. We have not yet drawn down this facility.

In December 2017, we issued an additional aggregate of US$7.0 billion unsecured senior notes. In June 2023, we repaid US$0.7 billion of our US$7.0 billion unsecured senior notes that became due. We are not subject to any financial covenant or other significant operating covenants under the unsecured senior notes. See note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information on unsecured senior notes.

In February 2021, we issued unsecured fixed rate senior notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of US$5.0 billion. Interest on the unsecured senior notes is payable semi-annually. Except for the sustainability notes we set aside for an aggregate principal amount of US$1.0 billion, we have used the proceeds from the issuance of the remaining unsecured senior notes for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, repayment of offshore debt and potential acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses. We have used the net proceeds from the issuance of the sustainability notes to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, one or more of our new or existing eligible projects in accordance with our sustainable finance framework as described in the final prospectus supplement relating to the offering. Examples of eligible projects include those in the sectors of green buildings, energy efficiency, COVID-19 crisis response, renewable energy and circular economy and design. See note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information on unsecured senior notes.

# Management Discussion and Analysis

In May 2024, we issued convertible unsecured senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of US$5.0 billion due on June 1, 2031. The convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest at an annual rate of  $0.5%$  is payable in arrears semiannually. We have used the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible unsecured senior notes to fund share repurchases and fund the cost of entering into capped call transactions. We are not subject to any financial covenant or other significant operating covenants under the unsecured senior notes. See note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information on convertible unsecured senior notes.

In November 2024, we issued unsecured fixed rate senior notes with varying maturities, consisting of U.S. dollar-denominated notes for an aggregate principal amount of US$2.65 billion and RMB-denominated notes for an aggregate principal amount of RMB17 billion (US$2.3 billion). The senior notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears semiannually. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of the unsecured fixed rate senior notes for general corporate purposes, including repayment of offshore debt and share repurchases. We are not subject to any financial covenant or other significant operating covenants under the unsecured senior notes. See note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information on unsecured senior notes.

As of March 31, 2025, we also had other bank borrowings of RMB49,534 million (US$6,826 million), primarily used for our capital expenditures in relation to the construction of corporate campuses, office facilities and infrastructure for logistics business, and for other working capital purposes. See note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information.

We believe that our current levels of cash and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, we may need additional cash resources in the future if we find and wish to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, strategic cooperation or other similar actions, which may include investing in technology, infrastructure, including data management and analytics solutions, or related talent. If we determine that our cash requirements exceed our amounts of cash on hand or if we decide to further optimize our capital structure, we may seek to issue additional debt or equity securities or obtain credit facilities or other sources of funding.

# Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2025 was RMB163,509 million (US$22,532 million), and primarily consisted of net income of RMB125,976 million (US$17,360 million), as adjusted for non-cash items and the effects of changes in working capital and other activities. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily included depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, and operating lease cost relating to land use rights of RMB29,260 million (US$4,032 million), gain related to equity securities and other investments of RMB28,652 million (US$3,948 million), loss on disposals of subsidiaries of RMB21,509 million (US$2,964 million), equity-settled share-based compensation expense of RMB13,970 million (US$1,925 million), and amortization of intangible assets and licensed copyrights of RMB13,199 million (US$1,819 million). Changes in working capital and other activities mainly consisted of an increase of RMB50,590 million (US$6,972 million) in prepayments, receivables and other assets, and long-term licensed copyrights, partially offset by an increase of RMB25,873 million (US$3,565 million) in accrued expenses, accounts payable and other liabilities.

Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2024 was RMB182,593 million, and primarily consisted of net income of RMB71,332 million, as adjusted for non-cash items and the effects of changes in working capital and other activities. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily included depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, and operating lease cost relating to land use rights of RMB26,640 million, loss related to equity securities and other investments of RMB23,480 million, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of RMB22,610 million, equity-settled share-based compensation expense of RMB18,546 million and amortization of intangible assets and licensed copyrights of RMB17,864 million.

The year-over-year decrease mainly attributed to the increase in our cloud infrastructure expenditure and changes in working capital, partly offset by year-over-year increase of adjusted EBITDA.

# Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2025 was RMB185,415 million (US$25,551 million) primarily reflected an increase in other treasury investments by RMB126,041 million (US$17,369 million) and capital expenditures of RMB85,972 million (US$11,847 million). These cash outflows were partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments by RMB23,395 million (US$3,224 million).

Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2024 was RMB21,824 million primarily reflected an increase in other treasury investments by RMB64,392 million, capital expenditures of RMB32,087 million, as well as cash outflow of RMB20,969 million for investment and acquisition activities. These cash outflows were partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments by RMB71,426 million and cash inflow of RMB23,930 million from disposal of investments.

# Management Discussion and Analysis

# Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2025 was RMB76,215 million (US$10,502 million) primarily reflected cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB86,662 million (US$11,942 million), dividend payment of RMB29,077 million (US$4,007 million) and acquisition of additional equity interests in non-wholly owned subsidiaries of RMB21,949 million (US$3,025 million), partly offset by net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured and convertible senior notes and the payments for capped call transactions of RMB67,032 million (US$9,237 million).

Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2024 was RMB108,244 million and was primarily reflected cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB88,745 million and dividend payment of RMB17,946 million.

# Capital Expenditure and Capital Commitment

Our capital expenditures have been incurred primarily in relation to (i) the acquisition of computer equipment and construction of data centers relating to our Cloud business and the operation of our mobile platforms and websites; (ii) the acquisition of infrastructure for logistics services and direct sales businesses; and (iii) the acquisition of land use rights and construction of corporate campuses and office facilities. In fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025, our capital expenditures totaled RMB34,330 million, RMB32,087 million and RMB85,972 million (US$11,847 million), respectively.

Our capital commitments primarily relate to capital expenditures contracted for purchase of property and equipment, including the construction of corporate campuses. Total capital commitments contracted but not provided for amounted to RMB18,372 million and RMB45,321 million (US$6,245 million) as of March 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively.

We recently announced our plan to invest in our cloud and AI infrastructure. Save as disclosed above, as at the date of this annual report, we did not have other detailed future plans for material capital assets.

# Pledge of Assets

Certain of our bank borrowings are collateralized by a pledge of certain buildings and property improvements, construction in progress and land use rights in the PRC, receivables and other treasury investments with carrying values of RMB34,056 million and RMB30,213 million (US$4,163 million), as of March 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. In addition, certain of our payables are collateralized by a pledge of certain short-term investments and other treasury investments with carrying values of nil and RMB3,697 million (US$509 million) as of March 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively.

# Contingent Liabilities

As at March 31, 2025, we had no material contingent liabilities.

# Holding Company Structure and Cash Flows through Our Company

We are a holding company with no operation other than ownership of operating subsidiaries in Chinese mainland, Hong Kong SAR, and elsewhere that own and operate our marketplaces and other businesses as well as a portfolio of intellectual property rights. As a result, we rely on dividends and other distributions paid by our operating subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to repurchase shares, to pay dividends and other cash distribution to our shareholders, fund intercompany loans, service outstanding debts and pay our expenses. If our operating subsidiaries incur additional debt on their own, the instruments governing the debt may restrict the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or remittances, including loans, to us.

Our holding company structure differs from some of our peers in that, although the variable interest entities hold licenses and approvals and assets for regulated activities that are necessary for our business operations, as well as certain equity interests in businesses, to which foreign investments are typically restricted or prohibited under applicable PRC law, we hold the significant majority of assets and operations in our subsidiaries and the significant majority of our revenue is captured directly by our subsidiaries. Therefore, our subsidiaries directly capture the significant majority of profits and associated cash flow from operations, without having to rely on contractual arrangements to transfer cash flow from the variable interest entities to our subsidiaries. In fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025, the significant majority of our revenues were generated by our subsidiaries. See "Business Overview — Organizational Structure" for a description of these contractual arrangements and the structure of our company. Also see " — Variable Interest Entity Financial Information" for further financial information of Alibaba Group Holding Limited, the major variable interest entities and their subsidiaries, our subsidiaries that are, for accounting purposes only, the primary beneficiaries of the major variable interest entities, and other subsidiaries and consolidated entities.

Investors in our securities, including our ADSs, Shares and notes, should note that, to the extent cash or assets in our business is in the PRC or a PRC entity, the funds or assets may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries, or the VIEs by the PRC government to transfer cash or assets. Under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions with respect to paying dividends or otherwise transferring any of their net assets to us. Applicable PRC law permits payment of dividends to us by our operating subsidiaries in China only out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our operating subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their net income, if any, each year to fund general reserves for appropriations until this reserve has reached  $50%$  of the related subsidiary's registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. In addition, registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from distribution. As of March 31, 2025, these restricted net assets totaled RMB334.8 billion (US$46.1 billion). See note 25 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. Also see "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in the People's Republic of China — We rely to a significant extent on dividends, loans and other distributions on equity paid by our operating subsidiaries in China." Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned enterprise out of China is also subject to certain restrictions on currency exchange or outbound capital flows. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in the People's Republic of China — Regulations on currency exchange or outbound capital flows may limit our ability to utilize our PRC revenue effectively."

 For the years ended March 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, Alibaba Group Holding Limited provided capital contributions and loans, and repaid loans, in the aggregate amounts of RMB32,025 million, RMB74,951 million and RMB94,307 million (US$12,996 million), respectively, to our subsidiaries, and our subsidiaries provided dividends and loans, and repaid loans, in the aggregate amounts of RMB112,153 million, RMB193,629 million and RMB175,208 million (US$24,144 million), respectively, to Alibaba Group Holding Limited.

For the years ended March 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, our subsidiaries and consolidated entities provided loans and repaid loans, in the aggregate amounts of RMB21,283 million, RMB17,986 million and RMB29,008 million (US$3,997 million) to the major VIEs and their subsidiaries, and the major VIEs and their subsidiaries provided loans, repaid loans and paid technical service fees to our subsidiaries and consolidated entities in the aggregate amounts of RMB14,172 million, RMB25,432 million and RMB38,462

# Management Discussion and Analysis

million (US$5,300 million), respectively. See “—Variable Interest Entity Financial Information” for classification of cashflow detailed in footnotes to the condensed consolidating schedule. We have settled and will continue to settle fees under the contractual arrangements with the variable interest entities. For a condensed consolidating schedule of financial information that disaggregates the operations and depicts the financial position, cash flows, and results of operations for the same periods for which audited consolidated financial statements are required, see “—Variable Interest Entity Financial Information.” Please also see the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more financial information.

# Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc.

# Research and Development

We have built our core technologies for our online and mobile commerce and cloud businesses in-house. We employ research and development personnel to build our technology platform and develop new online and mobile products. We recruit top and experienced talent locally and overseas, and we have advanced training programs designed specifically for new campus hires.

# Intellectual Property

We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade names, trade secrets, patents and other proprietary rights is critical to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, fair trade practice, copyright and trade secret protection laws and patent protection in China and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and our trademarks. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with all of our employees, and we rigorously control access to our proprietary technology and information. As of March 31, 2025, we had around 16,300 issued patents and approximately 9,200 publicly filed patent applications in China, and approximately 4,700 issued patents and approximately 1,500 publicly filed patent applications in various other countries and jurisdictions globally. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims.

# Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

# Interest Rate Risk

Our main interest rate exposure relates to our indebtedness and interest-bearing assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and other treasury investments. We manage our interest rate exposure with a focus on reducing our overall cost of debt and exposure to changes in interest rates. When considered appropriate, we use derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, to manage our interest rate exposure.

As of March 31, 2025, approximately  $24%$  of our total debt (including bank borrowings, unsecured senior notes and convertible unsecured senior notes) carries floating interest rates and the remaining  $76%$  carries fixed interest rates. We have entered into various agreements with various financial institutions as counterparties to swap a certain portion of our floating interest rate debt to effectively become fixed interest rate debt. After taking these interest rate swaps into consideration, approximately  $19%$  of our total debt carries floating interest rates and the remaining  $81%$  carries fixed interest rates as of March 31, 2025. All of the above mentioned interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and we expect these hedges to be highly effective. Certain of our indebtedness carries floating interest rates based on SOFR. As a result, the interest expenses associated with these indebtedness will be subject to the potential impact of any fluctuation in SOFR. An increase in SOFR could raise our financing costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, as well as our cash flows. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our indebtedness."

As of March 31, 2024 and 2025, if interest rates increased/decreased by  $1%$ , with all other variables having remained constant, and assuming the amount of interest-bearing assets and debts that bear floating interest were outstanding for the entire respective years, our profit attributable to equity owners would have been RMB6,010 million and RMB3,750 million (US$517 million) higher/ lower, respectively, mainly as a result of higher/ lower interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments. The analysis does not include floating interest rate debts whose interests are hedged by interest rate swaps.

# Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign currency risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. Although we operate businesses in different countries and regions, most of our revenue-generating transactions, and a majority of our expense-related transactions, are denominated in Renminbi, which is the functional currency of our major operating subsidiaries and the reporting currency of our financial statements. When considered appropriate, we enter into hedging activities with regard to exchange rate risk.

The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future.

To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would reduce the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of share repurchases, paying dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, funding inter-company loans, servicing outstanding debt and paying our expenses, or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would reduce the U.S. dollar amounts available to us.

As of March 31, 2024, we had Renminbi-denominated cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments of RMB381,326 million and U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments of US $30,166 million. Assuming we had converted RMB381,326 million into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of RMB7.2203 for US$ 1.00 as of March 29, 2024, our total balance of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments in U.S. dollar would have been US$82,979 million. If the Renminbi had depreciated by  $10%$  against the U.S. dollar, the balance in U.S. dollar would have been US$78,178 million.

As of March 31, 2025, we had Renminbi-denominated cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments that are unrestricted for withdrawal and use of RMB343,220 million and U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments of US $33,072 million. Assuming we had converted RMB343,220 million into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of RMB7.2567 for US$ 1.00 as of March 31, 2025, our total balance of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments in U.S. dollar would have been US$80,369 million. If the Renminbi had depreciated by  $10%$  against the U.S. dollar, the balance in U.S. dollar would have been US$76,069 million.

# Market Price Risk

We are exposed to market price risk primarily with respect to equity securities carried at fair value that are publicly traded. A substantial portion of our investments in equity method investees are held for long-term appreciation or for strategic purposes, which are accounted for under equity method and are not subject to market price risk. We are not exposed to commodity price risk. The sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure of equity securities and certain other financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis to market price risk at the end of each reporting period.

In fiscal years 2024 and 2025, if the market price of the respective financial instruments held by us had been  $1%$  higher/ lower as of March 31, 2024 and 2025, these instruments would have been approximately RMB762 million and RMB856 million (US$118 million) higher/ lower, respectively, all of which would be recognized as income or loss during the respective period.

 As of March 31, 2025, we had US $5.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, US$ 14.7 billion and RMB17.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of U.S. dollar-denominated and RMB-denominated unsecured senior notes, respectively, and bank borrowings of US$10.0 billion in aggregate, including a US$3.2 billion term loan outstanding and a US$6.5 billion revolving credit facility that we have not yet drawn down. Under the terms of our indebtedness and under any debt financing arrangement that we may enter into in the future, we are, and may be in the future, subject to covenants that could, among others, restrict our business and operations. If we breach any of these covenants, our lenders under our credit facilities and holders of our convertible senior notes and of our unsecured senior notes will be entitled to accelerate our debt obligations. Any default under our credit facilities or convertible senior notes or unsecured senior notes could require that we repay these debts prior to maturity as well as limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity. In particular, if our ADSs are delisted from the NYSE, holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes, which may also have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.

We also provide a guarantee for a credit facility of HK$6.5 billion (US$0.8 billion) in favor of Hong Kong Cingleot Investment Management Limited, a company that is partially owned by us, in connection with a logistics center development project at the Hong Kong International Airport. As of March 31, 2025, this entity has drawn down approximately HK$5.1 billion (US$0.7 billion) under this facility. In the event of default by this entity under the loan facility, we may be required to repay the full amount or a portion of the outstanding loan and interests and undertake the borrower's other obligations under the loan facility. Moreover, we provide a partial guarantee for the continuing obligations of this entity to the Airport Authority and may be required to fulfil the relevant obligations of this entity in the event of its default. Enforcement against us under these guarantees and other similar arrangements we may enter into in the future could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.
