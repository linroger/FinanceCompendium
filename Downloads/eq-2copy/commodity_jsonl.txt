The futures price exceeds the spot price when the cost of carry ($r + u$) exceeds the convenience yield ($y$), creating contango. When $y > r + u$, the futures price is below spot (backwardation), reflecting the premium for immediate access to the commodity. For energy commodities with limited storage, this relationship is dynamic and can shift rapidly based on inventory levels and supply disruptions. The exponential form reflects continuous compounding conventions common in derivatives pricing.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Perfect correlation between spot and futures price movements\n- No transaction costs, bid-ask spreads, or delivery frictions\n- Ability to store the commodity and borrow at known rates\n- Constant convenience yield (may be state-dependent in practice)\n- No credit risk or counterparty default considerations\n- Continuous trading and instantaneous arbitrage execution\n\n## Practical Use\nCost-of-carry models are fundamental for futures valuation, calendar spread pricing, and identifying arbitrage opportunities. Traders use deviations from this relationship to construct trading strategies. In practice, convenience yield varies with inventory levels, seasonal demand patterns, and market conditions. The model underpins the theory of optimal storage (Hotelling's rule) and explains the shape of the forward curve across different maturities. Energy traders particularly focus on the cost-of-carry relationship for crude oil, natural gas, and refined products."}
{"title":"Futures Price with Discrete Storage Costs","equation":"F = (S_0 + U)e^{rT} - V","category":"Commodity Derivatives","tags":["futures","storage-cost","discrete-carry","convenience-yield","forward-curve","no-arbitrage","cash-and-carry","arbitrage-pricing"],"note":"## Equation Variables\nThis formulation of futures pricing accounts for explicit storage costs and convenience benefits over discrete time periods, providing a more practical framework for commodities with substantial storage requirements.\n\n- **$F$**: Futures price for delivery at time $T$.\n- **$S_{0}$**: Current spot price of the commodity.\n- **$U$**: Present value of total storage costs over the holding period.\n- **$V$**: Present value of convenience benefits or scrap value.\n- **$r$**: Risk-free interest rate.\n- **$T$**: Time to delivery in years.\n\n## Interpretation\nThis model extends the continuous-time cost-of-carry formula to handle explicit storage costs and benefits. The futures price equals the future value of the spot price plus storage costs, minus any convenience benefits or residual value. For physical traders, storage costs ($U$) include warehousing, insurance, and handling fees, while convenience yield ($V$) represents the economic benefit of having physical inventory available. The relationship is fundamental to cash-and-carry arbitrage, where traders buy spot, store, and deliver against futures contracts. The arbitrage bounds established by this model define trading opportunities and price relationships across the forward curve.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Storage costs are known and deterministic\n- Convenience benefits can be quantified and valued\n- No restrictions on physical storage capacity\n- Perfect hedge ratio between spot and futures positions\n- Continuous monitoring and rebalancing capability\n- No quality degradation or spoilage during storage\n\n## Practical Use\nThis formulation is particularly valuable for commodities with significant storage infrastructure requirements, such as crude oil, refined products, and agricultural goods. Trading desks use it to evaluate the economics of physical storage (contango plays) and to identify mispriced futures contracts. The model informs decisions about tank farms, pipeline capacity, and inventory management. For agricultural commodities, it incorporates storage seasonability and helps determine optimal release strategies from strategic petroleum reserves or grain elevators."}

High convenience yields indicate strong immediate demand for physical access relative to future availability, often occurring during supply disruptions or inventory drawdowns. The formula rearranges the cost-of-carry relationship to solve for the implied yield given observed market prices. When futures trade at a discount to spot ($F < S_0$), the implied convenience yield exceeds the sum of financing and storage costs, signaling backwardation. This metric is closely monitored by market participants as a leading indicator of supply-demand tightness and inventory levels.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Observed futures and spot prices reflect market equilibrium\n- Storage costs are known and constant over the period\n- No market frictions or transaction costs\n- Interest rates are constant or appropriately term-structured\n- Futures prices are for standard delivery specifications\n\n## Practical Use\nConvenience yield estimation is critical for physical traders, risk managers, and quantitative analysts. It serves as an input for inventory optimization models, production planning, and storage valuation. Trading strategies often involve taking positions based on expected changes in convenience yield, such as buying physical inventory when implied yields suggest undervaluation. Energy companies use implied convenience yields to evaluate the economics of holding inventory versus selling forward. The metric also helps identify structural market regime changes, such as the transition from contango to backwardation during supply crises."}

The spread value reflects the differential cost of carry between two time periods, incorporating potential changes in convenience yield, storage costs, and interest rates. In energy markets, calendar spreads often exhibit seasonal patterns reflecting storage requirements, demand cycles, and production constraints. A narrowing calendar spread (bullish spread) may indicate improving supply-demand conditions for near-term delivery, while widening spreads suggest near-term supply stress. The spread captures market expectations about future convenience yields and inventory trajectories.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Constant interest rate across both periods\n- Convenience yields may differ by period but are deterministic\n- No delivery option value or quality specifications\n- Perfect correlation between spot prices at both maturities\n- Sufficient liquidity for both contract months\n\n## Practical Use\nCalendar spreads are among the most liquid and widely traded energy derivatives, offering lower margin requirements and reduced directional exposure compared to outright futures positions. Traders use calendar spreads to express views on the term structure of commodity prices without taking spot risk. Seasonal trading strategies involve rolling calendar spreads to capture the seasonal storage arbitrage. Energy producers use calendar spreads to hedge production timing uncertainty, while consumers hedge future procurement costs. The spread's sensitivity to inventory data and supply disruptions makes it a key indicator for market structure analysis."}
{"title":"Futures Forward Spread Pricing","equation":"Spread = F_1 - F_2","category":"Commodity Derivatives","tags":["forward-spread","spread-trading","futures-curve","inter-commodity-spread","basis-trading","seasonality","price-relationship","trading-strategy"],"note":"## Equation Variables\nThe forward spread represents the pure price differential between two futures contracts, serving as the fundamental building block for spread trading strategies in commodity markets.\n\n- **$Spread$**: Price difference between two futures contracts.\n- **$F_1$**: Price of the first futures contract (typically the lead month).\n- **$F_2$**: Price of the second futures contract (typically the following month).\n\n## Interpretation\nThe forward spread captures the market's assessment of the cost of carry between two delivery periods. Unlike calendar spreads based on the same underlying commodity, inter-commodity spreads compare related but distinct commodities (such as crude oil vs. gasoline). The spread filters out common price movements driven by macroeconomic factors, isolating the relative value between the two instruments. In contango markets, the spread is typically positive (near-month cheaper than far-month), while in backwardation, the spread may be negative or small. The spread's evolution over time provides insight into changing market structure, storage economics, and supply-demand dynamics.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Both contracts share the same underlying delivery specifications\n- Sufficient liquidity for accurate price observation\n- No delivery option value differential between contracts\n- Normal market conditions without extreme dislocations\n\n## Practical Use\nSpread trading is fundamental to commodity markets, offering reduced volatility and directional risk while maintaining exposure to relative value opportunities. Traders distinguish between intra-commodity spreads (same commodity, different maturities) and inter-commodity spreads (related commodities). The spread's historical relationship provides mean-reversion trading signals, while fundamental analysis identifies structural changes in the spread relationship. Energy traders closely monitor crack spread, spark spread, and other processing spreads that capture refining and generation margins. Spread orders constitute a significant portion of exchange volume, particularly in crude oil and natural gas markets."}

Kirk's approximation extends Black's model to the spread context by adjusting the strike and volatility to account for the correlation between the two underlying futures. The approximation works well when the correlation between assets is not extreme and when the at-the-money assumption holds approximately. The effective spread volatility combines the individual volatilities and correlation: $\\sigma_{spread} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2 - 2\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2}$. This formulation allows traders to price options on crack spreads, spark spreads, and other processing margins common in energy markets.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Log-normal distribution of underlying futures prices\n- Constant correlation between the two underlying prices\n- No early exercise (European-style option)\n- Known and constant volatilities\n- No dividends or convenience yields (or included in futures pricing)\n\n## Practical Use\nSpread options are extensively used in energy markets to hedge processing margins, storage economics, and time value differences. Refiners use crack spread options to protect refining margins against crude oil and product price movements. Power generators purchase spark spread options to hedge the margin between electricity and natural gas prices. The Kirk approximation provides quick pricing for market-making and risk management purposes, though more complex models (such as multidimensional trees or Monte Carlo simulation) may be used for exact pricing of long-dated or highly correlated spreads. Trading desks use spread options to express views on the relative strength of different energy markets."}

This formulation captures the exchange option nature of spread options, where the holder chooses between receiving one asset versus another. The model assumes bivariate log-normal distribution of the underlying futures prices, which implies that the spread itself follows a distribution that can be approximated. The key insight is that the spread option's value depends on the ratio of futures prices rather than their absolute levels, analogous to currency options. The correlation between underlying assets affects the spread's volatility and thus the option value.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Futures prices follow log-normal distributions\n- Constant volatility of the spread\n- No dividends or convenience yields during option life\n- European exercise style\n- Risk-neutral valuation applies\n- Correlation between assets is constant and captured in spread volatility\n\n## Practical Use\nBlack's spread option model is fundamental for pricing energy crack spread options, spark spread options, and other processing margin derivatives. The model enables market makers to provide quotes for these complex products and allows risk managers to hedge margin exposure. Energy companies use spread options to lock in processing margins while retaining upside participation. The model's simplicity makes it suitable for real-time pricing systems and margin calculations. However, for long-dated options or extreme correlation scenarios, more sophisticated approaches like Monte Carlo simulation with stochastic convenience yields may be necessary. The spread option framework also extends to weather derivatives and multi-commodity optimization problems."}

A positive crack spread indicates that product revenues exceed crude costs, while a negative spread signals margin compression or loss. The 3:2:1 ratio reflects typical U.S. refinery configuration optimized for gasoline production, though actual refiners may have different yield configurations. The spread is monitored daily by traders, investors, and energy analysts as a leading indicator of refinery profitability and crude oil demand strength. Seasonal patterns in the crack spread reflect demand cycles for transportation fuels and seasonal gasoline specifications.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Fixed yield assumptions (3:2:1 ratio approximates actual refinery output)\n- Product prices reflect current market values\n- No operating costs beyond crude acquisition (simplified margin)\n- Refinery can sell all products at quoted prices\n- Standardized product specifications (RBOB, ULSD)\n\n## Practical Use\nThe crack spread is the most actively traded energy spread, with exchange-traded crack spread futures available on major exchanges. Refiners use crack spread hedges to lock in margins by selling crude oil forward and buying products forward (or using crack spread futures directly). The spread's historical volatility provides risk management parameters for margin-at-risk calculations. Quantitative trading strategies exploit crack spread mean reversion and seasonal patterns. The crack spread also serves as an economic indicator, with widening spreads suggesting strong product demand or crude oversupply, while narrowing spreads indicate product oversupply or crude shortage."}

When spark spreads are positive, gas-fired generation is economically dispatched and generators earn margin; when negative, generators prefer not to run and may seek alternative arrangements. The spark spread is fundamental to electricity market economics, as gas-fired plants often set the marginal price in many power markets. The heat rate conversion ($1,000 \\text{ BTU/kWh} = 1 \\text{ MMBtu/MWh}$) allows direct comparison between fuel costs and power prices. Seasonal patterns reflect varying demand for both electricity and gas.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Constant heat rate efficiency for the generating unit\n- No start-up costs or minimum load constraints\n- Perfect market liquiditity for power and gas\n- No capacity payments or ancillary service revenue\n- Standardized BTU content for gas pricing\n\n## Practical Use\nSpark spread options and futures are among the most liquid power market derivatives, allowing generators to hedge generation margins and electricity consumers to manage procurement costs. Power plant valuations heavily depend on expected spark spreads over the asset's lifetime. The spark spread drives investment decisions in new generation capacity and retirement decisions for existing plants. In merit-order dispatch systems, the spark spread determines which generators operate and when. Trading strategies include spark spread arbitrage, spark spread correlation trading with other energy markets, and spark spread seasonal positioning based on weather and demand forecasts."}

Gas-fired generation produces approximately 0.4-0.5 tons of CO2 per MWh, so carbon prices significantly impact generation economics. The clean spark spread determines which generators are economically dispatched in carbon-constrained markets and affects investment in renewable generation. A positive clean spark spread indicates profitable operation even after accounting for carbon costs, while a negative spread may lead to reduced generation or fuel switching. The metric is increasingly important as carbon pricing mechanisms expand globally.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Known and constant carbon price (or appropriately hedged)\n- Fixed emission rate based on fuel chemistry\n- Carbon costs are fully passed through in market pricing\n- No carbon leakage or border adjustment effects\n- Standardized emissions accounting methodology\n\n## Practical Use\nClean spark spread analysis is essential for power market participants operating in carbon-constrained regions such as the European Union (EU ETS), California (Cap-and-Trade), and increasingly in other jurisdictions. Generation companies use clean spark spread hedges to lock in carbon-adjusted margins. Investment decisions in new generation capacity now require clean spark spread projections over multi-decade asset lifetimes. Carbon allowance prices directly impact clean spark spreads and thus the economics of gas versus coal and renewable generation. The clean spark spread also affects power purchase agreement negotiations and corporate renewable energy procurement strategies."}

The mean-reversion speed ($\\alpha$) determines how quickly prices adjust—high values indicate rapid adjustment to equilibrium, while low values suggest persistent deviations. The long-run mean ($\\beta$) represents the price level that would prevail under normal supply-demand conditions, potentially linked to production costs or marginal consumer willingness to pay. The OU process is a Gaussian process, enabling analytical solutions for derivatives pricing and risk management. The model is particularly appropriate for commodities with significant supply response, storage flexibility, or long-run equilibrium constraints.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Mean-reversion parameters are constant over time\n- Long-run mean is known and constant\n- Volatility is constant (homoscedastic)\- No jumps or sudden structural breaks\n- Instantaneous mean-reversion (continuous adjustment)\n\n## Practical Use\nThe OU model underlies many commodity derivatives pricing frameworks, including forward curve models and futures option valuation. Risk managers use OU simulations for Value-at-Risk calculations and stress testing. Production companies calibrate the model to historical prices to inform hedging decisions and production planning. The model's analytical tractability makes it suitable for calibration and real-time risk management applications. Modifications to the basic OU model include incorporating time-varying mean levels (seasonal effects), stochastic volatility, and jump components to better capture commodity price dynamics."}

In log-space, the model captures the observation that percentage changes are more constant than absolute changes across different price levels. The log-price follows an OU process, which implies that prices follow a log-normal distribution in levels. The model captures the long-run equilibrium where prices revert to a fundamental value determined by marginal production costs, demand elasticity, and available resources. The risk-neutral dynamics incorporate a risk premium that compensates investors for holding commodity exposure.

Calibration to market data yields implied parameters that inform risk management and trading decisions. The model's forward curve dynamics provide insight into term structure evolution and roll yield expectations. Energy trading companies use Schwartz-type models for asset valuation, portfolio optimization, and scenario analysis. The model also serves as a benchmark for comparing more complex pricing approaches. Despite its simplicity, the Schwartz model captures key features of commodity price behavior and remains widely used in both academic research and industry applications."}

When inventories are low, convenience yields rise (reflecting the value of physical access) while prices may also be high (due to supply constraints), creating negative correlation between price and convenience yield innovations. The model captures this relationship through correlated state variables, improving the model's ability to match observed forward curve shapes and option volatility surfaces. The two-factor structure allows for separate dynamics of short-term price movements (influenced by convenience yield shocks) and long-term equilibrium (governed by fundamental factors). This formulation provides more realistic term structure dynamics and improves option pricing accuracy.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Convenience yield is observable or proxied (e.g., by net investment return)\n- State variables follow correlated mean-reverting dynamics\n- Volatilities are constant\n- Market is complete with respect to the two factors\n- Correlation parameter is constant over time\n- No jumps or regime changes\n\n## Practical Use\nThe two-factor Schwartz model enables more accurate pricing of path-dependent derivatives and options with longer maturities. It improves the modeling of forward curve dynamics, particularly the relationship between near-term and long-term prices. Energy trading desks use the model for valuation of storage assets, swing contracts, and other complex derivatives with optionality. The stochastic convenience yield captures the inventory effect that is crucial for commodities with storage. Calibration requires market data from both forward prices and options, providing a richer parameter set that better reflects market expectations. The model serves as a foundation for more complex multi-factor and hybrid models used by sophisticated commodity market participants."}

Unlike many commodities, electricity cannot be economically stored, resulting in prices that spike dramatically during supply-demand imbalances and then rapidly revert to normal levels. The mean-reversion rate ($\\lambda$) is typically much higher for electricity than for storable commodities, reflecting the market's rapid adjustment through supply response and demand elasticity. The model captures the empirical observation that electricity prices spend most of their time near normal levels with occasional extreme excursions. The volatility parameter ($\\sigma$) captures the magnitude of normal price variations, while the model may be extended with jump components to better capture extreme events.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Mean-reversion is instantaneous and continuous\n- Price spikes are not explicitly modeled (requires jump extension)\n- Volatility is constant and homoscedastic\n- Long-run mean is constant and known\n- No seasonal patterns in parameters (may be calendar-dependent)\n- Perfect market efficiency in price discovery\n\n## Practical Use\nThe Langevin model serves as a foundation for electricity spot price modeling in power markets.

Risk management applications include calculating Value-at-Risk for power portfolios and stress testing extreme scenarios. The model's analytical tractability supports real-time risk assessment and margining. Extended versions incorporating seasonality, spikes (jump-diffusion), and stochastic volatility better capture observed power price dynamics. The model informs capacity expansion decisions, generator dispatch optimization, and demand response program design. Quantitative trading strategies exploit mean-reversion tendencies captured by the Langevin dynamics."}

The value function captures the optimal decision at each point, balancing the time value of optionality against immediate profits. The continuation value represents the expected value of maintaining flexibility, while the immediate value ($S_t - C_t$) captures the value from selling inventory now. The optimal strategy creates a trigger structure where injection occurs when prices are low relative to expected future prices, and withdrawal occurs when prices are high. The value of storage represents the difference between forward prices and spot prices in contango markets.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Perfect foresight of future price distributions\n- Known and deterministic convenience yields\n- Storage capacity and withdrawal/injection rate constraints\n- No operational constraints (outages, maintenance)\n- Continuous or discrete time with appropriate time step\n- Risk-neutral valuation applies\n\n## Practical Use\nStorage valuation is critical for energy companies, natural gas utilities, and trading firms managing storage assets. The dynamic programming framework informs trading decisions, operational planning, and asset valuations. Modern implementations use finite difference methods, Monte Carlo simulation with regression (Least Squares Monte Carlo), or tree-based methods to handle the high-dimensional state space. The valuation incorporates seasonal price patterns, weather derivatives, and correlation with other energy markets. Storage assets are often hedged using calendar spreads and options that capture the roll yield. The optionality embedded in storage is particularly valuable during periods of high price volatility and supply uncertainty."}

As near-dated futures contracts approach expiration, positions must be closed and rolled into longer-dated contracts to maintain exposure. The roll return (or roll yield) is the difference between the return of the rolled futures position and the underlying spot return. In contango markets, rolling forward creates negative roll yield (long positions sell low and buy high), while backwardation creates positive roll yield. The cumulative roll effect significantly impacts long-term commodity index returns and must be factored into investment decisions and hedging strategies. The strategy can be implemented with monthly, quarterly, or custom roll schedules depending on liquidity and exposure needs.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Sufficient liquidity in rolled-to contracts\n- Roll timing is predetermined or optimally selected\n- No transaction costs or bid-ask slippage\n- Perfect execution at observed prices\n- Consistent contract specifications and delivery terms\n\n## Practical Use\nStack-and-roll strategies are essential for commodity index funds, pension fund allocations, and corporate hedging programs. Commodity index providers (such as Bloomberg, S&P GSCI) publish roll schedules that define how indices manage expiration. Quantitative hedge funds develop optimized roll strategies to minimize negative roll yield in contango and maximize positive roll yield in backwardation. The strategy's effectiveness depends on the shape of the forward curve and expectations about future curve evolution. Roll analysis is incorporated into performance attribution, separating returns into spot return, roll return, and collateral return components. For physical market participants, understanding roll dynamics informs decisions about physical inventory timing and forward contracting strategies."}

A positive basis (futures > spot) indicates contango, where the market pays for the privilege of deferred delivery to cover storage and financing costs. A negative basis (futures < spot) indicates backwardation, where the convenience yield from physical ownership exceeds carrying costs, often during supply concerns or inventory drawdowns. The basis determines the economics of cash-and-carry arbitrage: when the basis exceeds carrying costs, arbitrageurs buy spot, store, and deliver against futures, driving the basis toward equilibrium. The relationship is linear for small $T$ but requires the exponential formulation for longer horizons.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Perfect correlation between spot and futures returns\n- Known and constant carry costs and benefits\n- No transaction costs or execution risk\n- Available storage capacity and financing\n- Standardized delivery specifications\n\n## Practical Use\nThe basis is closely monitored by physical traders, arbitrageurs, and risk managers as a real-time indicator of market structure. Storage arbitrage profitability depends on the basis relative to actual carrying costs. Hedging effectiveness depends on the basis risk (imperfect correlation between spot and futures). The basis varies seasonally, reflecting inventory cycles and production patterns. In natural gas markets, basis trading (trading location differentials) is a major activity, with prices quoted for various delivery points relative to benchmark contracts. Understanding basis dynamics is essential for physical procurement, logistics optimization, and financial hedging programs."}

The payoff depends on the spread between two futures contracts at expiration, making the option valuable when market expectations suggest significant spread widening or narrowing. The holder benefits from favorable spread movements while limiting downside risk to the option premium. Calendar options are commonly used by physical market participants to hedge timing uncertainty—for example, a producer uncertain about the optimal timing of physical sales might purchase a calendar option to lock in favorable spread levels. The option captures the optionality in choosing when to establish the spread position.\n\n## Assumptions\n- European exercise (only at expiration)\n- Known and constant volatilities\n- Correlated futures prices (captured in spread dynamics)\n- No early exercise value\n- Risk-neutral valuation applies\n- Standardized contract specifications\n\n## Practical Use\nCalendar options are traded on major energy exchanges and over-the-counter markets, providing hedging and trading tools for spread exposure. They are particularly valuable for managing timing uncertainty in production, consumption, and storage decisions. The options allow market participants to benefit from favorable spread movements while capping downside exposure. Quantitatively, calendar options require modeling the joint dynamics of the two underlying futures, often using bivariate log-normal or more complex stochastic processes. Trading strategies include spread position protection, directional spread bets with limited risk, and volatility trading on the spread. The calendar option structure also extends to other compound option strategies such as chooser options and ladder options."}

Each degree below the base temperature accumulates one HDD, representing additional heating requirement. The relationship is linear: colder weather increases HDD accumulation and associated heating demand. Weather derivatives pay based on cumulative HDD or CDD over a defined period (typically monthly or seasonal), providing hedge protection for companies exposed to temperature-related revenue variability. Natural gas utilities, heating oil distributors, and retail businesses with weather-sensitive sales use HDD derivatives to hedge earnings volatility. The payout structure is typically linear or capped, with the latter protecting against extreme weather while limiting premium costs.\n\n ## Assumptions\n- Base temperature is appropriate for the location and building stock\n- Temperature data is measured at standardized locations\n- No spatial correlation issues (for portfolio purposes)\n- Linear relationship between HDD and energy demand\n- Sufficient liquidity for hedging at reasonable costs\n\n## Practical Use\nWeather derivatives were pioneered in the energy sector but now cover precipitation, wind, and other meteorological variables. The over-the-counter market allows customized structures tailored to specific exposure profiles, while exchange-traded products provide standardized hedging tools. Pricing uses historical temperature data, actuarial analysis, and weather forecast models. Catastrophe bonds extend the weather derivative concept to natural disaster risk. Corporate risk managers use weather derivatives to hedge earnings volatility from weather-sensitive operations, including retail sales, agricultural production, and construction scheduling. The market continues to develop with new indices, improved data sources, and enhanced modeling approaches."}

The EU Allowance (EUA) price in the European Emissions Trading Scheme demonstrates how carbon prices have evolved from single digits to over 100 EUR/tCO2, driven by policy reforms and market reforms. Allowances function like commodities with unique supply dynamics determined by policy decisions rather than production costs. The option-like structure captures the asymmetric impact of carbon costs: installations face unlimited downside from high carbon prices but limited upside from low prices. Forward curves in carbon markets reflect expectations about future policy, economic activity, and technology costs.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Policy framework remains stable over the valuation horizon\n- Allowances are fungible across sectors and time periods\n- Perfect enforcement and monitoring\n- Market liquidity sufficient for accurate price discovery\n- Correlation with energy prices is captured in dynamics\n\n## Practical Use\nEmissions derivatives include spot allowances, forward contracts, options, and futures across multiple compliance markets (EU ETS, California, UK ETS, China national market). Industrial companies hedge compliance costs using forwards and options, while financial traders position on policy outcomes and macro trends. The interaction between carbon prices and energy markets creates cross-commodity trading opportunities, particularly between coal-to-gas switching in power generation. Carbon credit quality distinctions (forestry, renewable energy, avoidance versus removal) affect pricing and regulatory acceptance. The evolution of carbon markets toward broader coverage and higher prices makes emissions derivatives increasingly important for corporate risk management and investment decisions."}
{"title":"Coal Derivatives Pricing","equation":"F_{coal} = S_0 e^{(r + u - y)T} \\times QC \\times CV","category":"Commodity Derivatives","tags":["coal-derivatives","thermal-coal","coking-coal","price-adjustment-formula","quality-spread","heating-value","calorific-adjustment","coal-index"],"note":"## Equation Variables\nCoal derivatives incorporate quality adjustments that convert between different coal specifications, reflecting the energy content and usage characteristics of various coal types.\n\n- **$F_{coal}$**: Price of specific coal contract.\n- **$S_0$**: Base index price or reference coal price.\n- **$r$**: Risk-free interest rate.\n- **$u$**: Ocean freight and shipping costs.\n- **$y$**: Time charter equivalent or convenience yield.\n- **$T$**: Time to delivery.\n- **$QC$**: Quality coefficient (ash, sulfur, moisture adjustments).\n- **$CV$**: Calorific value ratio (heating content adjustment).\n\n## Interpretation\nCoal derivatives differ from other commodity derivatives due to significant quality variation between coal types. Thermal coal (for power generation) is priced based on energy content (kcal/kg) and impurity levels (ash, sulfur), while coking coal (for steel production) commands premium prices based on caking properties and metallurgical characteristics. The quality adjustment formula converts between actual delivered coal and reference specifications, protecting against basis risk from specification differences. Physical coal contracts typically reference published indices (such as Argus/McCloskey for thermal coal, Platts for metallurgical coal) with price adjustments for delivery location, timing, and quality. The coal market has unique dynamics influenced by mine production costs, shipping constraints, and demand from emerging market power sectors.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Reference indices accurately reflect market conditions\n- Quality adjustments follow standardized formulas\n- Shipping costs are known or hedged\n- No quality disputes or sampling variability\n- Contract specifications are unambiguous\n\n## Practical Use\nCoal derivatives provide hedging tools for mining companies, power generators, and trading firms. Forward contracts and swaps dominate the over-the-counter market, while exchange-traded products provide clearing and standardization. The complexity of coal quality adjustments requires sophisticated risk management to avoid basis losses. Coal price indices serve as reference points for long-term supply contracts and investment decisions. The energy transition is reshaping coal derivatives markets, with increasing focus on emissions costs, transition risk, and potential stranded assets. Coal price forecasting incorporates mine supply costs, shipping economics, renewable competition, and policy trajectories."}

Unlike pipeline gas with fixed delivery points, LNG cargoes can be redirected to markets offering the highest netback price (destination option). This flexibility is valuable during price dislocations between regional markets and has driven the development of spot LNG trading. The destination option is analogous to a multi-asset option where the holder can choose the optimal delivery point. Recent market developments include the emergence of global LNG hubs, increased liquidity in spot trading, and the development of derivatives that capture shipping optionality. The relationship between Henry Hub, TTF, JKM, and other regional gas benchmarks creates arbitrage opportunities and trading strategies.\n\n ## Assumptions\n- Sufficient shipping capacity and scheduling flexibility\n- Terminal access and regasification capacity available\n- No destination restrictions or contractual limitations\n- Known shipping costs and regasification fees\n- Complete markets for destination pricing\n\n## Practical Use\nLNG derivatives enable trading firms, utilities, and integrated energy companies to manage price risk across multiple regional markets. The development of LNG shipping as a tradable service has increased market efficiency and arbitrage opportunities. Destination flexibility options are valued using multi-factor models that capture regional price correlations and shipping cost dynamics. Portfolio optimization incorporates the optionality of cargo routing in supply chain planning. The growth of spot LNG trading has created new hedging needs addressed by over-the-counter derivatives and exchange-traded products. Understanding LNG derivatives is essential for market participants navigating the globalized gas market."}

Traditional index methodologies roll contracts according to fixed schedules, but enhanced approaches seek to optimize roll timing and contract selection to reduce negative roll yield. Strategies include rolling only when contango exceeds thresholds, using longer-dated contracts to reduce roll frequency, and dynamically adjusting weights to capture favorable curve movements. The optimization problem balances roll yield improvement against tracking error and transaction costs. Research shows that optimized rolling can add 1-3% annual return in contango markets without significantly increasing risk.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Historical roll yield patterns are predictive of future behavior\n- Transaction costs are acceptable for enhanced strategies\n- Tracking error relative to benchmark is within tolerance\n- Market liquidity supports strategy implementation\n- No regime changes that invalidate historical patterns\n\n## Practical Use\nInstitutional investors and commodity trading advisors employ roll yield optimization to enhance index returns and differentiate products. The methodology requires sophisticated modeling of forward curve dynamics, transaction cost analysis, and risk budgeting. Backwardation harvesting strategies specifically target markets where positive roll yield enhances returns, while contango mitigation strategies reduce losses in markets with negative roll characteristics. The optimization is ongoing, as market structure evolves with changing storage economics, production patterns, and investor flows. Performance attribution separates roll yield from spot return and collateral yield, providing transparency for investors evaluating commodity strategies."}

The objective function maximizes risk-adjusted return (mean-variance framework), while constraints capture practical limitations including concentration limits, liquidity constraints, and strategic allocation targets. Commodity portfolios require special consideration of roll yield, which can dominate spot returns over time, and basis risk from imperfect correlation between spot and futures. The covariance matrix captures not only volatility but also cross-commodity correlations, which are often high within energy complexes (crude, gasoline, heating oil) and between related commodities (natural gas, power, coal). Optimization enables systematic hedging of existing exposures and tactical positioning based on relative value views.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Expected returns are forecastable and stable\n- Covariance matrix is invertible and constant (or appropriately estimated)\n- Constraints are linear and tractable\n- Transaction costs are either negligible or incorporated separately\n- Risk measures beyond variance (VaR, CVaR) are not required\n\n## Practical Use\nMulti-commodity optimization is employed by commodity trading advisors, energy company treasury functions, and institutional investors allocating to commodities. The framework supports both strategic asset allocation (long-term target weights) and tactical trading (short-term positioning based on market views). Risk budgeting approaches decompose portfolio risk into commodity and factor contributions, enabling informed risk allocation decisions. Constraint sets commonly include gross exposure limits, sector concentration limits, liquidity-based position limits, and regulatory requirements for managed funds. The optimization is typically implemented using quadratic programming solvers, with robustness considerations for estimation error in expected returns and covariances."}
