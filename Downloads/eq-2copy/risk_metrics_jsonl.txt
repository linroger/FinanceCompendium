This represents the threshold loss level such that the probability of exceeding this loss is $1-\\alpha$.\n- **$\\mu$**: Expected return (or mean) of the portfolio value change distribution.\n- **$z_{\\alpha}$**: $\\alpha$-quantile of the standard normal distribution (e.g., 1.645 for 95%, 2.326 for 99%).\n- **$\\sigma$**: Standard deviation (volatility) of portfolio returns.\n\n## Interpretation\nVaR answers the question: \"What is my worst-case loss at confidence level $\\alpha$ under normal market conditions?\" For a 95% VaR of $1M, there is a 5% chance of losing more than $1M over the horizon. The parametric method assumes normally distributed returns, which enables analytical computation but may underestimate tail risk. This method is also known as the variance-covariance approach because it relies on the mean and covariance of returns.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Returns are normally distributed (log-normal for prices)\n- Volatility and correlation are constant over the horizon\n- Linear approximation adequate for the portfolio\n- No extreme events or regime changes\n- Portfolio positions remain constant during the horizon\n\n## Practical Use\nVaR is a regulatory requirement (Basel Accords for banks), used for setting risk limits, capital allocation, and risk reporting. It provides a single number that summarizes total portfolio risk. Limitations include: doesn't capture loss magnitude beyond VaR, assumes normal distribution (underestimates fat tails commonly observed in markets), and is not coherent (fails subadditivity). Expected Shortfall addresses some of these limitations by averaging losses beyond the VaR threshold."}

If we have 1000 days of historical returns and want 95% VaR, we find the 50th worst return (since $1-0.95 = 0.05$, and $1000 \\times 0.05 = 50$). The 50th worst return represents the threshold such that 95% of historical observations were better (less negative). This approach naturally captures fat tails, volatility clustering, and non-normal return distributions present in actual market data.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Historical returns are representative of future return distribution\n- Market conditions and portfolio composition remain similar\n- Sufficient historical data available for statistical significance\n- No structural breaks between historical and future periods\n- Lookback period appropriately chosen (balancing stability vs. relevance)\n\n## Practical Use\nHistorical simulation is widely used because it's intuitive, doesn't require distributional assumptions, and automatically incorporates all empirical features of returns including fat tails and skewness. It's particularly popular in risk management departments for its transparency and ease of explanation to non-technical stakeholders. Drawbacks include: requires large datasets, may miss unprecedented events not in history, and can be sensitive to lookback period selection."}

A call option with $\\Delta = 0.5$ means the option price increases $0.50 for every $1 increase in the stock price. Delta of 0.5 also means you need 2 options to hedge 1 share of stock (hedge ratio). Deep in-the-money options approach Delta of 1 (calls) or -1 (puts), behaving almost like the underlying. At-the-money options typically have Delta near 0.5. Delta changes as the underlying moves, requiring dynamic hedging to maintain neutrality.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Underlying follows geometric Brownian motion with constant volatility\n- No arbitrage opportunities exist\n- Risk-free rate is constant over option life\n- No dividends paid during option life (for basic formula)\n- Markets are efficient and continuous\n- European option exercise (can only expire at maturity)\n\n## Practical Use\nDelta is the most important Greek for hedging and risk management.

At-the-money options near expiration have maximum Gamma because small price moves can flip Delta from near 0 to near 1. Long options always have positive Gamma, benefiting from volatility while providing convexity. Gamma decay is a key consideration: Gamma increases as expiration approaches (for at-the-money options), making late-stage hedging more critical and costly.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Black-Scholes model assumptions apply (lognormal returns, constant vol, etc.)\n- Option is European style (only exercisable at expiration)\n- Volatility is constant and known with certainty\n- No transaction costs or bid-ask spreads\n- Continuous trading and perfect liquidity\n- No dividends during option lifetime (or adjusted for)\n\n## Practical Use\nGamma is critical for understanding rebalancing costs and model risk in option portfolios. Options with high Gamma (typically at-the-money, short-dated) require more frequent rebalancing and have higher trading costs. Risk models like Delta-Gamma approximation use Taylor series expansions to estimate option price changes: $\\Delta V \\approx \\Delta \\Delta S + \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma (\\Delta S)^2$. This approximation breaks down for large moves when higher-order terms matter, leading to the need for scenario analysis and stress testing."}

A Vega of 0.15 means the option price increases $0.15 for every 1 percentage point increase in volatility. Long options have positive Vega (benefit from volatility increases), while short options have negative Vega (hurt by volatility increases). Vega is highest for at-the-money options with longer time to expiration, as these have the most \"time value\" at risk from volatility changes.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Volatility is constant over the option's life (for calculation purposes)\n- Implied volatility is the appropriate measure of market's volatility expectation\n- No volatility smile or term structure (flat volatility across strikes and maturities)\n- Other parameters (underlying price, interest rates, time) remain constant\n- Markets are efficient and volatility changes are instantaneously priced\n\n## Practical Use\nVega is essential for understanding volatility exposure in option portfolios. Volatility trading strategies like \"long volatility\" or \"short volatility\" are explicitly betting on Vega. During periods of market stress (\"volpocalypse\"), Vega can explode as implied volatilities spike, causing large P&L moves for unhedged positions. The \"volga\" or \"Vega Gamma\" measures how Vega itself changes with volatility, important for understanding non-linear volatility risk."}

Option sellers collect Theta as premium decay while bearing the risk of adverse moves. Understanding Theta helps in strategy selection: income strategies (selling options) profit from Theta, while directional strategies (buying options) must overcome Theta to profit. Calendar spreads exploit differences in Theta across expirations. Theta should always be considered alongside Gamma - high Theta strategies often have high Gamma risk requiring careful management."}

For put options, Rho is negative (given by $-K T e^{-rT} N(-d_2)$) because higher rates reduce the present value of the put's payoff. The magnitude of Rho increases with time to expiration (longer discounting period) and with moneyness (in-the-money options have more rate sensitivity). In low-rate environments, Rho is typically small and often ignored in practical trading, but can become significant when rates change substantially.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Risk-free rate is known and constant over option life\n- A single risk-free rate applies across all maturities (flat yield curve)\n- Interest rate changes affect all instruments equally\n- No credit spread or funding differentials\n- Option is European style\n\n## Practical Use\nRho is generally the least important Greek for most trading strategies because interest rates change slowly and predictably. However, in certain environments (rising rate cycles, carry trades, long-dated options), Rho can become significant. Interest rate derivatives (caps, floors, swaptions) have much larger Rho exposure. For equity options, the dividend yield $q$ is often more important than Rho, and the formula generalizes by replacing $r$ with $r-q$ (cost of carry adjustment).

Specifically, when volatility increases, at-the-money options become more likely to finish in-the-money, increasing their Delta toward 0.5. Similarly, when the underlying price changes, the option's sensitivity to volatility (Vega) changes. Vanna is typically small for deep in/out-of-the-money options and largest for at-the-money options with moderate time to expiration. Understanding Vanna is crucial for understanding why Delta-hedged portfolios can still experience P&L from volatility changes even when hedged for pure Delta.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Black-Scholes model assumptions apply\n- Volatility and price changes are independent (this is what Vanna measures the cross-effect of)\n- No jumps or discontinuities in price or volatility paths\n- Constant volatility over the option life\n- European exercise style\n\n## Practical Use\nVanna is important for understanding P&L attribution in Delta-hedged option portfolios. A Delta-hedged, Vega-neutral portfolio can still lose money if price and volatility move together in the \"wrong\" direction. For example, if a portfolio has positive Vanna, a simultaneous price increase and volatility decrease (common in equity markets during rallies) will create losses. Vanna risk is inherently linked to the volatility surface - different strikes and expiries have different Vanna, creating cross-gamma effects when the vol surface shifts."}

This positive convexity means options become more sensitive to volatility changes as volatility itself increases. At-the-money options typically have the highest Volga because small volatility changes have the largest impact on options near the money where probability mass is concentrated. Volga decay is similar to Gamma decay - Volga increases as expiration approaches (for at-the-money options), making short-dated options more sensitive to volatility changes. A Volga of 0.1 means Vega increases by 0.1 for every 1 percentage point increase in volatility.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Volatility surface is smooth and differentiable\n- Volatility changes are small enough for second-order approximation\n- No volatility jumps or regime changes\n- Standard Black-Scholes model applies\n- No correlation between volatility and underlying returns\n\n## Practical Use\nVolga is crucial for understanding volatility risk beyond simple Vega exposure. Long volatility positions benefit from Volga because they gain from both volatility increases and the increasing sensitivity to further volatility changes (volatility of volatility). Short volatility positions face the risk that Vega increases when volatility spikes, amplifying losses. Trading the \"vol of vol\" is essentially trading Volga. Options with similar Vega can have very different Volga, so pure Vega-neutral portfolios can still have significant Volga exposure requiring careful management."}

For call options, Charm is typically negative, meaning Delta decreases (moves toward 0) as expiration approaches. For example, a call with Delta 0.60 today might have Delta 0.55 tomorrow if Charm is -0.05, requiring the trader to sell 0.05 shares to maintain Delta-neutrality. At-the-money options have the most negative Charm near expiration because their Delta changes most rapidly as the option approaches maturity. Ignoring Charm leads to \"Delta slippage\" and unexpected P&L in hedged portfolios.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Time passes while underlying price remains constant\n- Volatility and interest rates are constant\n- No dividends occur during the time decay period\n- Option exercise is European (no early assignment risk)\n- Black-Scholes assumptions hold throughout the decay period\n\n## Practical Use\nCharm is essential for managing Delta-hedged portfolios over time. Traders must \"pay\" Charm through continuous rebalancing - selling shares as call Deltas decay (if long calls) or buying shares as put Deltas increase (if long puts). This rebalancing cost is a significant component of the \"cost of carry\" for hedged option strategies. Charm interacts with other Greeks: Charm is often combined with Vanna in the \"Vanna-Charm\" matrix for more complete P&L attribution. Near expiration, Charm becomes very large in magnitude for at-the-money options, making last-day hedging particularly costly and critical."}

Historically, equity markets have Sharpe ratios around 0.3-0.5, while hedge fund strategies might target 0.5-1.0. The Sharpe Ratio enables comparison across assets with different risk levels - a high-return, high-volatility portfolio can have the same Sharpe as a low-return, low-volatility portfolio. Developed by William Sharpe (1994 Nobel laureate), it has become the standard metric for evaluating portfolio performance and setting risk budgets.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Returns are normally distributed (for proper risk interpretation)\n- Risk-free rate is appropriate for the portfolio's currency and duration\n- Volatility is measured over a representative period\n- Risk-free rate is available and liquid (no significant credit risk)\n- Returns are arithmetic (not geometric) for calculation\n\n## Practical Use\nThe Sharpe Ratio is used for portfolio comparison, manager selection, and capital allocation decisions. Risk parity strategies often target equal risk contribution, implicitly optimizing Sharpe. Modern Portfolio Theory uses Sharpe for the Capital Market Line. However, critics note that Sharpe can be manipulated through leverage or by using smoothed/volatility-adjusted returns. Alternatives like the Sortino Ratio address some limitations by focusing only on downside risk. Sharpe should be calculated using consistent methodology (e.g., annualized returns, rolling windows) for meaningful comparisons."}

A Sortino of 1.0 is equivalent to a Sharpe of 1.0 in terms of risk-adjusted return, but Sortino is typically higher when upside volatility exists. For skewed strategies (e.g., options selling, carry trades), Sortino provides a more meaningful measure because large upside returns shouldn't increase the risk denominator.\n\n ## Assumptions\n- Target return is appropriately set (risk-free rate or MAR - Minimum Acceptable Return)\n- Downside deviation captures the relevant tail risk\n- Return distribution is sufficiently asymmetric that upside volatility should be excluded\n- Sufficient observations for stable downside deviation estimate\n- Returns below target are the only relevant risk\n\n## Practical Use\nSortino is increasingly popular for evaluating hedge funds, alternative investments, and asymmetric strategies.

The choice of target return $R_f$ matters: using a higher target makes the denominator smaller, increasing the Sortino. Many practitioners prefer Sortino over Sharpe for its intuitive appeal, though both metrics have their place. Research shows Sortino ratios are more stable over time than Sharpe ratios for asymmetric strategies."}

A Treynor of 0.05 means the portfolio earns 5% excess return for each unit of beta. Higher Treynor indicates better compensation for market risk. Treynor is particularly useful when comparing diversified portfolios with similar diversification levels, as it focuses on the risk that cannot be diversified away.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Portfolio is well-diversified (idiosyncratic risk is negligible)\n- Beta is stable and meaningful measure of systematic risk\n- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) assumptions hold\n- Market proxy is appropriate for the portfolio\n- Beta estimation period is representative\n\n## Practical Use\nTreynor is useful for evaluating fund managers who are expected to take on systematic risk rather than idiosyncratic risk. It's commonly used by institutional investors with diversified portfolios. The ratio can be decomposed using Fama-French models to understand sources of return. Limitations include: beta can be unstable over time, assumes linear relationship with market, and may not capture all systematic factors. Combining Treynor with Sharpe provides a fuller picture: high Sharpe with low Treynor suggests idiosyncratic alpha, while high Treynor suggests market timing skill."}

This metric captures loss magnitude, not just probability, making it essential for risk-averse investors and in capital preservation contexts. Drawdowns have psychological and practical importance: a 50% loss requires a 100% gain to recover. MDD is often reported alongside average drawdown, frequency of drawdowns, and time to recovery.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Portfolio value is marked-to-market regularly\n- Observation period is sufficiently long to capture market cycles\n- No contributions or withdrawals during the period (or they are treated appropriately)\n- Peak is measured before trough (no look-ahead bias)\n- Returns are compounded properly (geometric linking)\n\n## Practical Use\nMaximum Drawdown is critical for risk management, stress testing, and investor communication. It's often a key constraint in portfolio mandates (e.g., \"maximum drawdown not to exceed 20%\"). Fund managers report drawdown statistics prominently in marketing materials. The relationship between return and drawdown follows a power law in many markets, suggesting that larger drawdowns are more probable than Gaussian assumptions would suggest.

Many funds advertise their Calmar as a key selling point. A Calmar of 3.0 is often considered a target for systematic trend-following strategies. However, Calmar has limitations: it uses only the worst drawdown, ignoring frequency and depth of other drawdowns. It's also sensitive to the observation period - a fund with a large historical drawdown will have suppressed Calmar even if current conditions are improved. Combining Calmar with average drawdown and return statistics provides a more complete picture."}

Monotonicity means riskier positions (worse outcomes) get higher risk numbers. Translation invariance means adding cash reduces risk by exactly that amount. Positive homogeneity means scaling risk scales risk proportionally (10x position = 10x risk). Subadditivity means diversification reduces or at least doesn't increase risk - this is the most important property, ensuring merged portfolios aren't riskier than separate portfolios. VaR fails subadditivity (counterexample exists), while Expected Shortfall satisfies all four axioms, explaining regulatory preference for ES.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Outcomes are in a space of random variables (e.g., bounded or integrable)\n- Ordering $\\leq$ is proper (antisymmetric)\n- Risk measure is real-valued\n- Scalar multiplication and addition are defined\n- No transaction costs or other frictions in combining portfolios\n\n## Practical Use\nCoherence provides the theoretical foundation for modern risk management. Basel III replaced VaR with Expected Shortfall partly because ES is coherent. Risk measures that violate subadditivity can encourage regulatory arbitrage through portfolio splitting. Other coherent risk measures include: entropic risk measures, spectral risk measures, and distorted risk measures. The dual representation of coherent risk measures connects them to sets of probability measures (risk envelopes), providing computational and interpretive insights. Understanding coherence helps practitioners evaluate new risk measures and recognize when their risk assessments may be misleading."}

If a portfolio has a net Delta of $10M to S&P 500, and S&P 500 has a 1-day 95% VaR of 2%, then portfolio VaR is $10M \\times 2\\% = $200K. This works well for linear positions (forward contracts, linear swaps) and near-the-money options. The method assumes positions can be aggregated by their sensitivity to common risk factors, then risk factors' VaRs are combined using correlations. Error increases with portfolio nonlinearity, option maturity, and correlation changes.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Positions are approximately linear in risk factors (Delta dominates)\n- Risk factor VaRs are computed using the same distribution assumptions\n- Risk factor correlations are either accounted for in factor VaRs or assumed zero\n- Delta is measured at current market conditions\n- Portfolio composition doesn't change during the VaR horizon\n\n## Practical Use\nDelta-normal VaR is computationally efficient and widely used for regulatory reporting and limit monitoring.

For portfolios with significant convexity, full revaluation (historical simulation or Monte Carlo) is preferred despite higher computational cost.

This directly measures the risk contribution of individual positions, useful for limit monitoring and capital allocation. IVaR is not the same as standalone position VaR because it accounts for diversification effects - a position that reduces portfolio VaR through negative correlation has negative IVaR. The relationship between IVaR, marginal VaR, and component VaR provides the basis for risk budgeting.\n\n## Assumptions\n- VaR can be computed accurately for both portfolio states\n- Marginal change is approximately linear (IVaR ≈ Marginal VaR for small positions)\n- Portfolio diversification effects are properly captured\n- VaR horizon and confidence level are held constant\n- No position interactions beyond those captured in VaR calculation\n\n## Practical Use\nIVaR is essential for risk attribution and trader limit management. Risk managers use IVaR to justify risk limits and evaluate new trades. However, IVaR has limitations: it's not additive (IVaR(A+B) ≠ IVaR(A) + IVaR(B) generally) and can be sensitive to portfolio composition.

Numerical methods (finite differences, Monte Carlo with pathwise derivatives) are often used. Hedge ratios must account for the discrete monitoring adjustment - a daily monitored barrier has higher survival probability than a continuously monitored one with the same level.

The holding period scaling matters because longer liquidation periods increase both price risk and cost accumulation.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Liquidity conditions during the VaR horizon match the spread assumption\n- Position can be fully liquidated within the holding period\n- Market impact is linear with trade size (often violated for large trades)\n- No feedback effects from liquidation on market prices (unless explicitly modeled)\n- Bid-ask spreads are representative of execution costs\n\n## Practical Use\nLVaR is used for illiquid positions and portfolios where liquidity risk is material. Basel III introduced liquidity coverage ratios and considers liquidity in market risk capital. Trading desks monitor \"liquidity-adjusted limits\" that account for the cost of exiting positions. Advanced LVaR models include: Almgren-Chriss optimal execution framework, queue-based models (matching engine dynamics), and endogenous liquidity models where fire sales cause feedback effects. For the most illiquid assets (ABS, CDO tranches), LVaR can be 2-3x higher than standard VaR, significantly affecting capital allocation."}

A floating strike lookback call gives the right to buy at the minimum price, so its value depends on how close current price is to the running minimum. The Delta is reduced compared to a vanilla option because some of the option's value is already \"locked in\" by the extreme price observation. If $S$ is close to $S_{\\text{max}}$ (near the running maximum), the lookback call Delta approaches zero because the strike is already favorable. Conversely, if $S$ is far from $S_{\\text{max}}$, Delta approaches the vanilla Delta.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Underlying price path is fully observable and continuous\n- Maximum/minimum is observed continuously (or discrete sampling specified)\n- No early exercise constraint (European style lookback)\n- Volatility is constant or term structure specified\n- No dividends (or appropriate adjustments made)\n\n## Practical Use\nLookback options are used for hedging uncertain timing decisions or capturing trend-following returns. Their Greeks are path-dependent, meaning Monte Carlo simulation with pathwise differentiation or the Likelihood Ratio Method is needed for accurate estimation. The continuous monitoring assumption is often adjusted for discrete observation (daily max/min). Lookback options are more expensive than vanilla options because they offer better payoffs, and their Greeks show interesting dynamics: Delta increases when the underlying moves away from the extreme, and Gamma spikes when the extreme price is updated (when a new maximum/minimum is reached)."}
