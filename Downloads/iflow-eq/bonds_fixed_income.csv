"Zero-Coupon Bond Price","P = \frac{F}{(1 + y)^{n}} = F \times e^{-n \ln(1+y)}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation prices a zero-coupon bond"
"Coupon Bond Price","P = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1 + y)^{t}} + \frac{F}{(1 + y)^{n}} = \underbrace{\frac{C}{y} \left[1 - (1 + y)^{-n}\right]}_{\text{annuity factor}} + \underbrace{\frac{F}{(1 + y)^{n}}}_{\text{principal PV}}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation decomposes coupon bond pricing into annuity and lump-sum components"
"Bond Price with Semi-Annual Coupons","P = \sum_{t=1}^{2n} \frac{C/2}{(1 + y/2)^{t}} + \frac{F}{(1 + y/2)^{2n}} = \frac{C}{2y} \left[1 - \left(1 + \frac{y}{2}\right)^{-2n}\right] + \frac{F}{\left(1 + \frac{y}{2}\right)^{2n}}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation captures semi-annual compounding conventions in bond markets"
"Macaulay Duration","D_{\text{mac}} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} t \times \frac{CF_{t}}{(1 + y)^{t}}}{P} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} t \times PV(CF_{t})}{P}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation calculates Macaulay duration"
"Modified Duration","D_{\text{mod}} = \frac{D_{\text{mac}}}{1 + \frac{y}{m}} = -\frac{1}{P} \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation transforms Macaulay duration into price sensitivity measure"
"Effective Duration","D_{\text{eff}} = \frac{P_{-} - P_{+}}{2P_{0} \times \Delta y} = -\frac{1}{P} \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta y}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation measures duration for bonds with embedded options"
"Convexity","C = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} t(t+1) \times \frac{CF_{t}}{(1 + y)^{t+2}}}{P} = \frac{1}{P(1 + y)^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2} P}{\partial y^{2}}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation measures the curvature of the bond price-yield relationship"
"Price Change Approximation","\frac{\Delta P}{P} \approx -D_{\text{mod}} \times \Delta y + \frac{1}{2} C \times (\Delta y)^{2} = \frac{\partial P}{P} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^{2} P}{P} (\Delta y)","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation provides the second-order Taylor approximation of bond price changes"
"Spot Rate Bootstrapping","y_{t} = \left( \frac{CF_{t}}{P - \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \frac{CF_{i}}{(1 + y_{i})^{i}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{t}} - 1 = \left( \frac{\text{remaining CF}}{P - \text{known PV}} \right)^{\frac{1}{t}} - 1","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation extracts the term structure of spot rates from market bond prices"
"Forward Rate","f_{t","t+1} = \left( \frac{(1 + y_{t+1})^{t+1}}{(1 + y_{t})^{t}} \right) - 1 = \frac{(1 + y_{t+1})^{t+1}}{(1 + y_{t})^{t}} - 1","Bonds and Fixed Income"
"Z-Spread","Z = y - y_{\text{spot}} = \frac{1}{D_{\text{mac}}} \ln\left( \frac{\text{bond price}}{\text{spot PV of CFs}} \right)","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation calculates the constant spread over the spot curve that prices a bond correctly"
"Option-Adjusted Spread","OAS = Z - \frac{\text{OptionValue}}{D_{\text{mod}} \times P} \times 10000","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation calculates the spread after adjusting for embedded options"
"Effective Convexity","C_{\text{eff}} = \frac{P_{-} + P_{+} - 2P_{0}}{P_{0} \times (\Delta y)^{2}} = \frac{1}{P} \frac{\partial^{2} P}{\partial y^{2}}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation measures convexity for bonds with embedded options"
"DV01","DV01 = -D_{\text{mod}} \times P \times 0.0001 = -\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \times 0.0001","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation quantifies interest rate risk in dollar terms"
"Clean Price","P_{\text{clean}} = P_{\text{dirty}} - A = P_{\text{quoted}}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation separates quoted prices from settlement prices"
"Accrued Interest","A = C \times \frac{d}{D} = C \times \frac{\text{days held}}{\text{days in period}}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation calculates interest earned but not yet paid"
"Bond Equivalent Yield","BEY = \left( \frac{F}{P} - 1 \right) \times \frac{365}{d} = \left( \frac{F - P}{P} \right) \times \frac{365}{d}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation annualizes T-bill discount yields for comparison with coupon bonds"
"Callable Bond Price","P = \min(P_{\text{straight}}"," P_{\text{call}}) = P_{\text{straight}} - \max(0"," P_{\text{straight}} - P_{\text{call}})"
"Convertible Bond Price","P = P_{\text{straight}} + P_{\text{conversion option}} = P_{\text{straight}} + \max(0"," S \times \text{ratio} - P_{\text{strike}})","Bonds and Fixed Income"
"Mortgage-Backed Security Price","P = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{PMT_{t}}{(1 + y)^{t}} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{principal}_{t} + \text{interest}_{t}}{(1 + y)^{t}}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation prices mortgage-backed securities with changing cash flows"
"Average Life","AL = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} t \times \frac{CF_{t}}{(1 + y)^{t}}}{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_{t}}{(1 + y)^{t}}} = \frac{\sum t \times PV(CF_{t})}{\sum PV(CF_{t})}","Bonds and Fixed Income","This equation calculates the expected duration of mortgage-backed securities"
