Currency Option Delta (Call),Delta_C = e^{-qT} * N(d_1),Currency and FX - Currency Options,This equation calculates the delta of a currency call option. Delta_C represents the sensitivity to the spot rate, q is the foreign risk-free rate, T is time to expiration, and N(d_1) is the cumulative normal distribution. Foreign currency options use the Garman-Kohlhagen model.

Delta_P represents the sensitivity to the spot rate, q is the foreign risk-free rate, T is time to expiration, and N(-d_1) is the cumulative normal. Put delta is negative, as put prices fall when the currency appreciates.
Garman-Kohlhagen Call Price,C = e^{-r_d T} * (F * N(d_1) - K * N(d_2)),Currency and FX - Currency Options,This equation prices a European currency call option using the Garman-Kohlhagen model. C represents the call price, r_d is the domestic rate, F is the forward rate, K is the strike, and N(d) are cumulative normal distributions. This extends Black-Scholes for two currencies.
