Zero-Coupon Bond Price,P = F / (1 + y)^T,Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation calculates the price of a zero-coupon bond. P represents the bond price, F is the face value (par value), y is the yield to maturity as a decimal, and T is the time to maturity in years. Zero-coupon bonds pay no coupons and return the face value at maturity. The price is the present value of the face value discounted at the yield to maturity.
Zero-Coupon Bond Price (Continuous),P = F * e^{-yT},Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation calculates the price of a zero-coupon bond using continuous compounding. P represents the bond price, F is the face value, y is the continuously compounded yield to maturity as a decimal, T is the time to maturity, and e is Euler's number. Continuous compounding is commonly used in theoretical finance and derivatives pricing.
Coupon Bond Price,P = sum_{t=1}^n (C / (1 + y)^t) + (F / (1 + y)^n),Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation calculates the price of a coupon bond. P represents the bond price, C is the periodic coupon payment, F is the face value, y is the yield to maturity per period as a decimal, t is the time period, and n is the total number of periods. The price is the sum of the present values of all coupon payments plus the present value of the face value at maturity.
Coupon Bond Price (Annual),P = C/y * (1 - 1/(1 + y)^n) + F/(1 + y)^n,Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation calculates the price of an annual coupon bond using the annuity formula. P represents the bond price, C is the annual coupon payment, y is the annual yield to maturity as a decimal, n is the number of years to maturity, and F is the face value. This form simplifies the calculation by using the annuity formula for the coupon stream.
Coupon Bond Price (Semi-Annual),P = C/y/2 * (1 - 1/(1 + y/2)^{2n}) + F/(1 + y/2)^{2n},Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation calculates the price of a semi-annual coupon bond. P represents the bond price, C is the annual coupon payment, y is the annual yield to maturity as a decimal, n is the number of years to maturity, and F is the face value. Most corporate bonds pay coupons semi-annually, requiring adjustment to the pricing formula.
Bond Price Between Coupon Dates,P = (C/y) * (1 - 1/(1 + y)^n) + F/(1 + y)^n + C * (1 - f),Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation calculates the bond price between coupon dates, accounting for accrued interest. P represents the clean price (excluding accrued interest), C is the coupon payment, y is the yield to maturity, n is the number of full periods remaining, F is the face value, and f is the fraction of the coupon period that has elapsed. The full price (dirty price) includes accrued interest.
Accrued Interest,AI = C * (Days since last coupon / Days in coupon period),Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation calculates the accrued interest on a bond between coupon dates. AI represents the accrued interest, C is the coupon payment, and the ratio represents the fraction of the coupon period that has elapsed. Accrued interest compensates the seller for the interest that has accumulated since the last coupon payment.
Dirty Price,DP = Clean Price + Accrued Interest,Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation expresses the relationship between dirty price and clean price. DP represents the dirty price (full price), Clean Price is the quoted price excluding accrued interest, and Accrued Interest is the interest accumulated since the last coupon. Buyers pay the dirty price, which is the sum of the clean price and accrued interest.

For zero-coupon bonds, the YTM is simply the annualized return from holding the bond to maturity.
Yield to Maturity (Coupon Bond),P = sum_{t=1}^n C/(1 + y)^t + F/(1 + y)^n,Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation defines the yield to maturity for a coupon bond. y represents the yield to maturity that equates the present value of all cash flows to the current price P. The YTM for coupon bonds must be solved numerically (e.g., using Newton-Raphson) as there is no closed-form solution.
Current Yield,CY = C / P,Fixed Income - Bond Pricing,This equation calculates the current yield of a bond. CY represents the current yield, C is the annual coupon payment, and P is the current bond price. The current yield measures the annual income return as a percentage of price but ignores capital gains or losses from price changes and the time value of money.

The zero-coupon yield curve is the foundation for pricing all fixed income securities.
Par Yield,y_par = (1 - P_T) / (sum_{t=1}^T P_t),Fixed Income - Yield Curve Analysis,This equation calculates the par yield from zero-coupon discount factors. y_par represents the par yield (coupon rate that prices the bond at par), P_T is the discount factor for maturity T, and P_t are the discount factors for each coupon date. The par yield curve shows the coupon rate required for bonds to price at par.

R_price represents the price risk, P(y + dy) is the bond price after a yield change, and P(y) is the current price. Price risk arises from uncertainty about future interest rate movements and their impact on bond prices.
Total Bond Risk,R_total = R_price + R_reinv,Fixed Income - Bond Risk Measures,This equation calculates the total bond risk. R_total represents the total risk, which is the sum of price risk and reinvestment risk. These two risks often move in opposite directions, and immunization seeks to balance them.

Information Ratio,IR = (R_portfolio - R_benchmark) / TE,Fixed Income - Bond Risk Measures,This equation calculates the information ratio of a bond portfolio. IR represents the information ratio, which measures risk-adjusted excess returns. The numerator is the average excess return, and TE is the tracking error. Higher information ratios indicate better risk-adjusted performance relative to the benchmark.
