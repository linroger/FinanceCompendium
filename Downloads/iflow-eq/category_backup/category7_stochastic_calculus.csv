Standard Brownian Motion,W_0 = 0, E[W_t] = 0, Var(W_t) = t, W_t ~ N(0, t),Stochastic Calculus Foundations - Stochastic Processes,This equation defines standard Brownian motion (Wiener process). W_t represents the Brownian motion at time t, with initial value 0, mean 0, variance t, and normal distribution N(0,t). Brownian motion has independent increments and continuous paths, making it fundamental to stochastic calculus.
Brownian Motion Increments,W_{t+delta t} - W_t ~ N(0, delta t),Stochastic Calculus Foundations - Stochastic Processes,This equation describes the increments of Brownian motion. The increment over a small time interval delta t is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance delta t. Increments over non-overlapping intervals are independent, which is a key property of Brownian motion.
