No-Arbitrage Price Interval,V_sub <= V_market <= V_super,Advanced Topics,This equation defines the no-arbitrage price interval in incomplete markets. The market price must lie between the sub-replication and super-replication prices. This interval can be wide in highly incomplete markets
Utility-Based Pricing,V = sup_{consumption} E[U(consumption)],Advanced Topics,This equation defines utility-based pricing. V represents the value maximizing expected utility U of consumption
Indifference Pricing,Indifference Price = E[U(W + payoff - price)] - E[U(W)],Advanced Topics,This equation defines the indifference price. The indifference price is the amount that makes the investor indifferent between holding the derivative and not holding it. Indifference pricing depends on the investor's utility function U and initial wealth W.
Entropy Risk Measure,rho(X) = (1/alpha) * ln(E[exp(-alpha * X)]),Advanced Topics,This equation defines the entropic risk measure. rho(X) represents the risk-adjusted value of the random payoff X
Convex Risk Measure,rho(X) = sup_{Q in Q} (E_Q[-X] - alpha(Q)),Advanced Topics,This equation defines a convex risk measure. rho(X) represents the risk measure
Robust Optimization,min_{x} sup_{theta in Theta} f(x,Advanced Topics,Advanced Topics - Incomplete Markets
Ambiguity Aversion,V = inf_{Q in Q} E_Q[payoff] + phi(Q),Advanced Topics,This equation defines pricing under model uncertainty (ambiguity aversion). V represents the value
Good-Deal Bounds,theta_min <= theta <= theta_max,Advanced Topics,This equation defines the good-deal bounds on the market price of risk theta. The bounds restrict the set of equivalent martingale measures to those that are not too extreme. Good-deal bounds narrow the no-arbitrage price interval by excluding unrealistic pricing measures.
Minimal Martingale Measure,dW_t^Q = dW_t^P - (sigma_t / sigma^2) * dW_t^P,Advanced Topics,This equation defines the minimal martingale measure. The minimal martingale measure is the equivalent martingale measure that is closest to the physical measure in terms of relative entropy. It is used when the market price of risk is not uniquely defined.
Föllmer-Schweizer Decomposition,X_t = M_t + A_t,Advanced Topics,This equation defines the Föllmer-Schweizer decomposition. X_t represents the discounted payoff
Mean-Variance Hedging,min E[(Payoff_T - Hedge_T)^2],Advanced Topics,This equation defines mean-variance hedging. The objective is to minimize the mean-squared hedging error between the payoff and the hedge portfolio. Mean-variance hedging is the optimal quadratic hedging strategy in incomplete markets.
Quadratic Hedging,Hedge = delta_t * S_t + V_t,Advanced Topics,This equation defines quadratic hedging with a traded asset S_t and a residual value V_t. The hedge portfolio minimizes the mean-squared hedging error. Quadratic hedging is widely used when perfect hedging is impossible.
Market Price of Model Risk,lambda_model = (V_model - V_true) / sigma_model,Advanced Topics,This equation defines the market price of model risk. lambda_model represents the Sharpe ratio of model risk
Model Uncertainty,V = E_Q[payoff] + lambda * ModelRisk,Advanced Topics,This equation incorporates model risk into pricing. V represents the risk-adjusted value
Deep Hedging,Hedge_theta(S_t) = NeuralNetwork_theta(S_t),Advanced Topics,This equation defines deep hedging using neural networks. Hedge_theta represents the hedging strategy parameterized by theta
