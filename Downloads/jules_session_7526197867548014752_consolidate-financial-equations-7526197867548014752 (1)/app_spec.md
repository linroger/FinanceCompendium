orchestrate a team of agents to help you complete this task. make sure to triple check the outputs, and make absolutely sure there are no similar or duplicate equations. if there are, consolidate them. if they are different, combine them into a single equation like a = b = c, and consolidate their notes as well. go through the consoli dated csv carefully and read all the equations. your task is to do another round of consolidations in which you make an ear nest effort to remove all duplicates and near-duplicates, and leave only the 300-500 most important equations. remove the unimportant ones, or the really dumb ones, like quantum, esg, the unmathematical equations, bitcoin option, or the really simple ones that are kind of obvious and not very useful or mathematical. make an earnest effort to name the ones missing names, and to expand on the notes. i only need 4 columns for the csv: the title, equation, main category(i dont need subcategory, just the main category), and notes. i dont care about the source file path. give the md file too create a new folder called opencode—glm-consolidated where you will place your work. have the agents record their findings in supermemory using the supermemory mcp and also use the mcp agent mail tools to log findings and insights as well.  want you to go through them very granularly, and set the repeating equations equal to one another if it makes sense to do so, ie a = b = c. also, fix the formatting and normalize everything, so that the titles don't start with 1., etc. also, there are a ton of formatting and other issues that you need to fix. there are a ton of equations with the title discount factor. why? you will need to read through each equation manually, figure out what wrong or if it needs to be consolidated, and then make the changes manually. don't use a script
