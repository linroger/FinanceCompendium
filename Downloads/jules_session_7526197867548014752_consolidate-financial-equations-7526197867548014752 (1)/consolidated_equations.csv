Weighted Average Maturity,WAM = ∑[i=1 to M] w_i × T_i,"WAM represents the weighted average maturity of loans within an MBS pool, calculated as the weighted sum of individual loan maturities T_i with weights w_i proportional to their outstanding balances.

For practical MBS valuation, SMM is applied to the outstanding principal balance at the beginning of each month: Prepayment_t = SMM_t × Balance_{t-1} × (1 - SMM_t/2), where the factor (1 - SMM_t/2) represents the average balance during the month.",eq3/gemini-primer/gemini_primer.md; eq3/fixed_income_primer.txt

SABR MODEL,dF_t = \alpha_t F_t^\beta dW_t^F,"The SABR (Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho) model describes forward price dynamics where \alpha_t represents the stochastic volatility parameter. The exponent \beta controls the backbone of the volatility smile - \beta = 1 gives lognormal dynamics, \beta = 0 gives normal dynamics, and intermediate values produce a CEV-type structure. This parameterization captures the empirical observation that implied volatility varies with the level of forward rates. | When volatility of volatility \nu = 0, SABR reduces to Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) model. The instantaneous variance is \sigma^2(F_t) = \alpha^2 F_t^{2\beta}, making volatility power-dependent on underlying level. This local volatility model generates skew without smile curvature. For \beta < 1, variance decreases as price falls, preventing extreme negative movements and creating skew consistent with leverage effect. The CEV model lacks the time-dependent smile dynamics provided by stochastic volatility. | Standard industry model for volatility smiles in rates/FX. | To accommodate negative rates observed in Eurodollar and SOFR markets post-2008, shifted SABR introduces shift parameter s > 0 ensuring F_t + s > 0. The implied volatility formula generalizes by replacing F_t with F_t + s throughout. This shift preserves lognormal dynamics for shifted forward, maintaining analytical tractability.

For MBS, convexity is typically negative (C < 0), particularly when prepayment options are in-the-money. Negative convexity occurs because accelerated prepayments on rate declines cap price appreciation, while slowed prepayments on rate increases amplify price declines.

This metric is particularly important for asset-liability management and duration matching. | WAL represents the weighted average life with timing convention using mid-period cash flows. The factor (t - 0.5) assumes cash flows occur evenly throughout each period, providing a more precise measure than using period-end timing.

The logarithmic return formulation is common in continuous-time models and provides mathematical tractability. The mechanism ensures that extreme returns in either direction are truncated, creating a smoother return profile.

The GlobalCap and GlobalFloor represent the maximum and minimum total returns achievable, providing ultimate downside protection and upside limitation. This dual structure - local limits on individual periods plus global limits on total performance - creates sophisticated risk-return profiles. The global features are particularly important for risk management, as they bound the extreme tail behavior that could arise from consecutive periods of extreme performance.

SABR for Swaption Volatility Skew,\frac{\partial \sigma_{swap}}{\partial \ln K} \approx \frac{\rho \nu}{S^{1-\beta}},"Swaptions are priced using SABR with forward swap rate S as underlying. The skew in swaption volatility surfaces reflects correlation between swap rates and volatility of those rates. In normal SABR (\beta = 0), skew is constant \frac{\rho \nu}{\alpha} across moneyness levels. For caps/floors, SABR is typically applied to forward LIBOR rates with \beta calibrated to produce observed smile shapes. Market practice often uses normal SABR (\beta = 0) for negative rate environments post-2008 crisis. | This leading-order approximation shows that skew depends directly on correlation \rho and vol-of-vol \nu. For normal SABR (\beta=0), skew simplifies to \frac{\rho \nu}{\alpha}, independent of forward level. Lognormal SABR (\beta=1) produces \frac{\rho \nu}{\alpha}, constant skew in log-moneyness space. The sign of \rho determines skew direction: positive \rho yields upward-sloping skew (higher volatility for higher strikes), matching equities markets; negative \rho produces downward skew typical of FX and some interest rate markets.",eq3/sabr-model.txt
Euler Allocation Principle,\rho(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \frac{\partial \rho(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_i},"Euler's allocation principle states that any positively homogeneous risk measure \rho of degree 1 can be decomposed into a sum of weighted marginal contributions. This fundamental result from convex analysis provides the theoretical foundation for coherent risk allocation. The homogeneity property \rho(c\mathbf{w}) = c\rho(\mathbf{w}) for c > 0 ensures that scaling the portfolio scales the risk proportionally. For risk measures satisfying this property (including portfolio volatility, VaR under normality, and Expected Shortfall), the allocation is unique and satisfies the full allocation property. The partial derivatives \frac{\partial \rho(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_i} represent infinitesimal changes in risk per unit change in position size, providing a natural basis for performance attribution and capital allocation in financial institutions.",eq3/portfolio_risk_measures_phd.txt

The three-branch structure provides better approximation of the underlying diffusion process, particularly valuable for American options where the early exercise boundary must be accurately determined. The trinomial framework naturally accommodates mean-reverting processes and stochastic volatility models through appropriate parameter selection. The additional degree of freedom enables exact matching of the first three moments of the underlying process (mean, variance, and skewness) rather than just the first two moments in binomial trees. This moment-matching capability proves crucial for capturing volatility smile effects and ensuring no-arbitrage conditions across the entire term structure. The computational complexity remains O(N^2) for N time steps, similar to binomial trees, but the enhanced stability allows coarser discretization while maintaining accuracy. The trinomial structure also facilitates implementation of implicit finite difference schemes through its matrix representation, enabling efficient solution of the underlying partial differential equation.",eq3/tree_methods_primer.txt

The calibration process must ensure positive probabilities and maintain the no-arbitrage condition that forward prices grow at the risk-free rate. The implied volatility function is typically parameterized using spline interpolation or parametric forms to ensure smoothness and stability. The calibration algorithm iteratively adjusts local volatilities to minimize the sum of squared differences between model and market prices, often employing Levenberg-Marquardt optimization or similar techniques. Regularization terms may be added to penalize excessive volatility variation and ensure numerical stability. The resulting local volatility surface must satisfy the Dupire equation: σ_local^2(K,T) = 2∂C/∂T + rK∂C/∂K / K^2 ∂^2C/∂K^2 where C(K,T) is the call price as a function of strike and maturity.
