Second Tranche Spread,s^{(2)}_{A^{(2)} D^{(2)}} = 𝔼[∫_0^T e^{-rt} dEL_t^{(2)}]/[∫_0^T e^{-rt} dt N_0^{(2)} (D^{(2)} - A^{(2)})],Credit Models,Pricing formula for second-loss tranche in CDO structure. Similar to first-loss but with different attachment/detachment points.
CDS Par Spread,s = (1-R) ∫_0^T P(0 t) λ(t) e^{-∫_0^t λ(u)du} dt / ∫_0^T P(0 t) e^{-∫_0^t λ(u)du} dt,Credit Models,Par spread for credit default swap equating premium leg to protection leg. Expresses credit spread in terms of hazard rate and discount factors. Alternative notation: S = (1-R) ∫ e^{-rt} Q(t) λ(t) dt / ∫ e^{-rt} Q(t) dt where Q(t) represents survival probability.
Black-Cox First Passage Model,τ = inf{t ≥ 0: V_t ≤ K(t)},Credit Models,First passage time model for credit risk where default occurs when asset value hits time-dependent barrier. Extension of Merton model allowing early default.
CSA Discounting (OIS),V(t) = 𝔼^ℚ[exp(-∫_t^T c(u) du) Payoff],Credit Models,Post-crisis discounting using collateral rate c(u) instead of LIBOR. Reflects funding costs and credit risk mitigation through collateral.
Expected Shortfall,CVaR_α = 𝔼[L|L > VaR_α] = μ + σ/(1-α) φ(z_α),Credit Models,Coherent risk measure representing expected loss beyond VaR threshold. More conservative than VaR for tail risk measurement.
Hazard Rate Process,λ_t = λ(t X_t) where X_t is state vector,Credit Models,General specification for hazard rate process in credit models. Allows for time-varying and state-dependent default intensity.
Black-Scholes for Equity as Call,E_t = V_t Φ(d_1) - D e^{-r(T-t)} Φ(d_2),Credit Models,Merton model treating equity as call option on firm value. Strike equals debt face value D with maturity matching debt maturity.
