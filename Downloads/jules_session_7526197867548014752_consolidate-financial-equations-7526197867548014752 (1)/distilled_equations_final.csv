Average Life,AL = ∑[t=1 to N] t × CF_t^{principal} / ∑[t=1 to N] CF_t^{principal},Fixed Income,"AL represents the weighted average time to receipt of principal payments (both scheduled and unscheduled). CF_t^{principal} = SP_t + PP_t denotes total principal received at time t. Average life measures the timing uncertainty of MBS cash flows and is a key metric for assessing exposure to reinvestment risk and rate movements. Higher prepayment speeds reduce average life by accelerating principal return, while slower speeds extend average life. This metric is particularly important for asset-liability management and duration matching. | WAL represents the weighted average life with timing convention using mid-period cash flows. The factor (t - 0.5) assumes cash flows occur evenly throughout each period, providing a more precise measure than using period-end timing. For monthly cash flows, this adjustment shifts timing by approximately half a month.

For more precision with prepayments: CF_t^{interest} = (B_{t-1} - SP_t - PP_t/2) × WAC_t/12, which accounts for prepayments occurring mid-month. Interest payments are the primary source of cash flow for pass-through MBS and decrease over time as the outstanding balance declines through both scheduled and unscheduled payments."
Discount Factor Relationships,SP_t = MP_t - Interest_t,Fixed Income,"SP_t represents the scheduled principal payment at time t, calculated as the total mortgage payment MP_t minus the interest portion. For a level-payment mortgage with balance B_{t-1}, WAC_t, and remaining term N-t+1: MP_t = B_{t-1} × WAC_t/12 × (1 + WAC_t/12)^{N-t+1} / [(1 + WAC_t/12)^{N-t+1} - 1]. Interest_t = B_{t-1} × WAC_t/12. The scheduled amortization component is deterministic given the mortgage terms and declines over time as the balance decreases. This forms the baseline cash flow before accounting for prepayments."
I-Spread (Interpolated Spread),Cost_{convexity} ≈ 0.5 × |C| × σ_y^2 × WAM,Fixed Income,"Cost_{convexity} represents the annualized cost of holding MBS with negative convexity, approximated using the magnitude of convexity |C| squared yield volatility σ_y, and weighted average maturity WAM. This cost arises because negative convexity causes underperformance when yields move significantly. Investors demand compensation for bearing this cost, reflected in higher OAS. In high volatility environments, the convexity cost increases, making MBS less attractive relative to positively convex bonds. This framework quantifies the tradeoff between carry (coupon income) and convexity cost."

Weighted Average Coupon,WAC = ∑[i=1 to M] w_i × r_i,Fixed Income,"WAC represents the weighted average coupon rate of loans within an MBS pool, calculated as the balance-weighted sum of individual mortgage rates r_i. WAC determines the gross interest income of the pool and is a primary determinant of the MBS yield. As loans prepay, the WAC evolves because loans with higher or lower coupons are removed differentially depending on rate environment. Investors earn the net coupon: WAC minus servicing spread minus guarantee fee for agency MBS."
Weighted Average Maturity,WAM = ∑[i=1 to M] w_i × T_i,Fixed Income,"WAM represents the weighted average maturity of loans within an MBS pool, calculated as the weighted sum of individual loan maturities T_i with weights w_i proportional to their outstanding balances. WAM measures the time-weighted maturity of the underlying mortgage pool and is disclosed for all agency MBS. As loans prepay, the WAM declines because older loans are removed from the pool. This metric helps investors understand the pool's maturity characteristics and how they evolve through prepayment activity."
Yield to Maturity (YTM),P_{mkt} = \sum_{i=1}^n C e^{-y t_i} + F e^{-y t_n},Fixed Income,The YTM is the internal rate of return (IRR) of the bond.

"P(t,T) = exp[-A(t,T) - B(t,T)r(t)]","where B(t,T) = (1 - e^{-α(T-t)})/α and A(t,T) = ∫_t^T θ(s)B(s,T)ds - σ²/(4α³)[1 - e^{-α(T-t)}]²[1 - e^{-2αt}]",Interest Rate Models,"This closed-form solution for zero-coupon bond prices is a key advantage of the Hull-White model. The function A(t,T) captures the convexity adjustment and ensures the model matches the initial term structure. The exponential affine form arises from the Gaussian nature of the short rate process."
Portfolio Variance Decomposition,\sigma_p^2 = \mathbf{w}^\prime \Sigma \mathbf{w} = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N w_i w_j \sigma_{ij},Interest Rate Models,"This fundamental equation represents the total variance of a portfolio with N assets, where \mathbf{w} is the N-dimensional vector of portfolio weights, \Sigma is the covariance matrix of asset returns, and \sigma_{ij} represents the covariance between assets i and j. The double summation captures both individual asset variances (when i=j) and pairwise covariances. For PhD-level analysis, note that this decomposition assumes the covariance matrix is positive semi-definite, which ensures \sigma_p^2 \geq 0. The quadratic form \mathbf{w}^\prime \Sigma \mathbf{w} is homogeneous of degree 2 in portfolio weights, making it suitable for optimization using quadratic programming techniques. Advanced considerations include the impact of estimation error in \Sigma, particularly when N approaches or exceeds the number of observations, leading to eigenvalue shrinkage and regularization techniques."
Prepayment Model Calibration Loss Function,L(θ) = ∑[i=1 to K] w_i × (Prepayment_i^{model}(θ) - Prepayment_i^{observed})^2,Interest Rate Models,L(θ) represents the loss function for calibrating prepayment model parameters θ to historical data. The function minimizes the weighted sum of squared errors between model-predicted prepayments and observed prepayments across K historical periods. The weights w_i can prioritize more recent observations or specific loan segments. This least-squares calibration ensures the model captures empirical patterns while avoiding overfitting. Alternative specifications include maximum likelihood estimation assuming prepayments follow binomial distributions or incorporating regularization terms to prevent extreme parameter values.
RATCHET FEATURE MECHANICS,"R_{accumulated} = \notag_{i=1}^{n} max(min(ln(S_{t_i}/S_{t_{i-1}}), c), f)",Interest Rate Models,"This equation describes the accumulated return under ratchet mechanisms, where c represents the local cap and f represents the local floor on logarithmic returns. The ratchet feature locks in positive returns while providing downside protection, creating a path-dependent payoff structure. The logarithmic return formulation is common in continuous-time models and provides mathematical tractability. The mechanism ensures that extreme returns in either direction are truncated, creating a smoother return profile. The product structure means that each period's capped/floored return contributes multiplicatively to the final payoff, leading to complex interactions between consecutive periods' performance."
Refinancing Incentive Model,CPR_t^{refi} = α × Φ(β × (r_t - WAC_t) + γ × (WAC_t - r_t)_+ + ε_t),Interest Rate Models,"This equation models refinancing-driven prepayments as a function of the incentive to refinance. r_t represents the current mortgage rate, WAC_t is the weighted average coupon of the MBS pool, and (x)_+ denotes the positive part function max(x,0). The term (r_t - WAC_t) captures the burnout effect (prepayments slow as high-coupon mortgages are removed), while (WAC_t - r_t)_+ captures refinancing incentive when current rates fall below pool coupon. Φ is the standard normal CDF, α scales overall prepayment speed, β controls sensitivity to burnout, γ measures refinancing intensity, and ε_t represents random shocks. This structure captures the path-dependent nature of refinancing behavior."
Partial Differential Equation,w_i \frac{\partial \sigma_p}{\partial w_i} = w_j \frac{\partial \sigma_p}{\partial w_j} = \frac{\sigma_p}{N},Interest Rate Models,"A portfolio construction method that allocates risk equally rather than capital. In a traditional 60/40 portfolio, equities contribute 90% of the risk. Risk Parity leverages low-volatility assets (bonds) so their risk contribution equals that of equities, ostensibly creating a more robust portfolio across different economic regimes."
SABR-LMM,"dL_k = \alpha_k L_k^\beta dW_L, \quad d\alpha_k = \nu \alpha_k dW_\alpha",Interest Rate Models,A hybrid model combining the LMM structure (for evolving the yield curve) with the SABR volatility model (for capturing the smile of each rate). This is essential for pricing complex interest rate exotics like Bermudan Swaptions or TARNs where both the correlation structure of the curve and the volatility smile of each rate matter significantly.
SABR-LMM (Multi-Factor),dF_j = mu_j dt + sigma_j F_j^beta dW_j,Interest Rate Models,Vector SABR for multiple forwards. Correlation matrix for dW_j. Captures joint dynamics of forward curve. Used for multi-asset interest rate derivatives.
Schwartz Model (One Factor),d(\ln S_t) = \underbrace{\kappa(\alpha - \ln S_t)}_{\text{Mean Reversion}} dt + \sigma dW_t,Interest Rate Models,"Unlike stocks, commodities exhibit mean reversion because high prices induce supply (mining/planting) and reduce demand, pushing prices back down. The Schwartz model captures this by using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the log-price. 'alpha' is the long-run equilibrium price level."
Simple Rate Conversion,"L(t,T) = (1/P(t,T) - 1)/(T-t)",Interest Rate Models,"L(t,T) represents the simple (act/360 or act/365) rate between times t and T, commonly used in money markets and LIBOR settings. This linear compounding convention calculates interest as principal times rate times day count fraction. The relationship shows how simple rates relate to discount factors: higher simple rates correspond to lower discount factors. Simple rates are additive over periods but do not account for compounding within periods."
Interest Rate Swap,C_{swap} \approx C_{fixed},Interest Rate Models,"Similar to duration, the convexity of a swap is dominated by the fixed leg. This means swaps exhibit the same desirable convexity properties as bonds, making them effective hedging instruments for bond portfolios."
Interest Rate Swap,D_{swap} \approx D_{fixed} - \underbrace{D_{float}}_{\approx 0},Interest Rate Models,"The duration of a receiver swap (receive fixed, pay float) is approximately equal to the duration of the fixed leg, because the floating leg has negligible duration (resets to par). Thus, entering a receiver swap is equivalent to buying a long-term bond funded by short-term borrowing."
Swap Pricing Formula,"V_{payer} = \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n \tau_i P(0, T_i) (L_i - K)}_{\text{Net Cashflows}}",Interest Rate Models,"The value of a vanilla interest rate swap is the present value of the net cash flows. For a payer swap (pay fixed K, receive floating L), the value is the sum of the discounted difference between the forward rate L_i and the fixed rate K. Alternatively, it is $V_{float} - V_{fixed}$."
Interest Rate Swap,"R_{swap} = \frac{1 - P(0,T)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \underbrace{\tau_i P(0,T_i)}_{\text{PVBP}}}",Interest Rate Models,The Par Swap Rate is the fixed rate K that makes the initial value of the swap zero. It equates the value of the fixed leg (PV of coupons) to the value of the floating leg (which equals Par - PV of Principal). This rate represents the market's aggregate expectation of future LIBOR rates.
Interest Rate Swap,SS = R_{swap} - \underbrace{Y_{treasury}}_{\text{Risk-Free Proxy}},Interest Rate Models,"The Swap Spread is the difference between the swap rate and the yield of a government bond of the same maturity. It reflects the credit risk of the interbank market relative to the government, as well as supply/demand dynamics for hedging and balance sheet constraints."
Swaption Pricing (Bachelier),V_{payer} = A(t) [(S(t) - K) N(d) + \sigma \sqrt{T} N'(d)],Interest Rate Models,Normal model for swaptions used in low/negative rate environments.
The swap's value at any time t post-inception derives from the difference between the contractual fixed rate and the prevailing market swap rate:,"V_t = NA \times (r_{FIX,0} - r_{FIX,t}) \times \sum_{i=1}^{n'} \tau_i P(t,T_i)",Interest Rate Models,"Where NA denotes the notional amount, r_{FIX,0} is the original contract fixed rate, r_{FIX,t} represents the current market swap rate for the remaining tenor, and the summation constitutes the forward annuity factor. This expression reveals that swap values exhibit linear sensitivity to interest rate movements, making duration and convexity calculations essential for risk management applications."
"The volatility structure σ(t,T) is central to the HJM framework. For implementation, common specifications include:","σ(t,T) = σ_0 exp(-λ(T-t))",Interest Rate Models,"This exponential volatility structure generates the Hull-White model, where σ_0 > 0 controls overall volatility level and λ > 0 determines the rate of decay with maturity. The parameter λ captures the empirical observation that short-term forward rates exhibit higher volatility than long-term rates."

Vasicek,dr_t = \underbrace{a(b-r_t)}_{\text{Mean Reversion}} dt + \sigma dW_t,Interest Rate Models,"The Vasicek model is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the short rate r_t. It introduces mean reversion: if rates are high, the drift is negative; if low, positive. This pulls rates towards the long-term mean 'b' with speed 'a'. Its main flaw is that it is Gaussian, allowing interest rates to become negative, which was considered a theoretical defect until recent years (post-2015) when negative rates became a reality in Europe/Japan."
Volatility Calibration:,σ_k^{market}² = (1/(T_k-t)) * ∫_t^{T_k} σ_k(s)² ds,Interest Rate Models,"The market-implied volatility from caplet prices relates to the time-averaged model volatility. Calibration involves solving this integral equation for the piecewise constant volatility function σ_k(t). The typical parameterization uses constant volatility within each tenor period: σ_k(t) = σ_{k,j} for t ∈ [T_{j-1}, T_j], creating a lower-triangular volatility matrix."

For cliquet options, the independence of non-overlapping periods in Brownian motion simplifies pricing, but stochastic volatility or jump models introduce complex correlation patterns. The \delta_{ij} represents the Kronecker delta, indicating zero correlation between distinct periods in the Black-Scholes framework. However, empirical evidence suggests volatility clustering creates positive autocorrelation in squared returns, violating this independence assumption. The correlation structure becomes crucial when pricing cliquet options under realistic market conditions, as it affects the probability of consecutive periods hitting cap or floor limits. Advanced models incorporating stochastic volatility or regime-switching mechanisms capture these empirical regularities but require sophisticated numerical methods for pricing and hedging."
