Optimal Commodity Storage Valuation,V = max_{q_i ∈ [q_{min} q_{max}]} 𝔼^ℚ[∑_{i=1}^N e^{-r t_i} q_i (S_{t_i} - K)],Commodities,Real options valuation of commodity storage facilities, determining the optimal injection and withdrawal strategy to maximize expected discounted cash flows under operational constraints. **Mathematical Foundation**: The storage valuation V = max_{q_i ∈ [q_min, q_max]} 𝔼^ℚ[∑_{i=1}^N e^{-r t_i} q_i (S_{t_i} - K)] where q_i is the quantity injected/withdrawn at time t_i, S_{t_i} is spot price, K is storage cost. This is a stochastic optimal control problem solved via dynamic programming. **Key Assumptions**: Risk-neutral pricing, deterministic storage costs, capacity constraints q_min to q_max, Markovian price dynamics. **Practical Applications**: Natural gas storage valuation, oil tank farm optimization, electricity storage (batteries), agricultural commodity storage. **Limitations**: Complex optimization problem; requires accurate price model and cost assumptions. **Implementation**: Least-squares Monte Carlo for high dimensions; dynamic programming for low dimensions. **Related Concepts**: Swing options for electricity; real options analysis for commodity investments.
