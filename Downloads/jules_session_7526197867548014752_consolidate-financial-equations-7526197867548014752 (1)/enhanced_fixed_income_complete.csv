Discount Factor Equivalence Relationships,DF(t T) = P(t T) = 1/(1+y(T-t))^{T-t} = exp(-r(T-t)),Fixed Income,Fundamental relationship establishing equivalence between discount factors, bond prices, and different compounding conventions in fixed income mathematics. **Mathematical Derivation or Foundation**: The discount factor DF(t,T) represents the present value of $1 received at time T from time t. For continuously compounded rates: DF(t,T) = e^{-r(T-t)}. For annually compounded yields: DF(t,T) = 1/(1+y)^{T-t}. Bond prices P(t,T) equal discount factors for zero-coupon bonds. These relationships form the foundation of term structure modeling and arbitrage-free pricing. **Key Assumptions and Limitations**: Assumes deterministic interest rates with no uncertainty about future rate realizations. Requires arbitrage-free markets where equivalent investments have equal values. The flat yield curve assumption (constant y across maturities) is often violated in practice, leading to term structure risk. Different compounding conventions (annual vs continuous) can cause discrepancies in multi-period calculations. Market frictions like transaction costs, liquidity constraints, and credit risk are ignored. The model breaks down in extreme rate environments or during financial crises when arbitrage relationships fail. **Practical Applications in Finance**: Fundamental to yield curve construction through bootstrapping from market instruments like Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Enables pricing of complex fixed income securities by discounting future cash flows. Critical for risk management calculations including duration, convexity, and value-at-risk measures. Used in derivatives pricing for interest rate swaps, futures, and options. Essential for asset-liability management in banks and pension funds. Forms the basis for relative value analysis comparing securities with different cash flow patterns. **Related Concepts and Extensions**: Connects to the entire term structure modeling framework, including parametric models like Nelson-Siegel and Svensson extensions. Extends to forward rate calculations and the expectations hypothesis. Related to stochastic models like Heath-Jarrow-Morton for modeling rate uncertainty. Generalizes to multi-factor models incorporating level, slope, and curvature factors. Links to credit risk modeling through hazard rates and survival probabilities. Forms foundation for inflation-adjusted securities pricing through real discount factors. **Implementation Considerations**: Requires careful handling of day count conventions (actual/360, actual/actual, 30/360) to ensure consistent discounting. Bootstrapping algorithms must handle irregular payment schedules and overlapping maturities. Numerical stability issues arise with very long maturities or extreme rate levels. Interpolation methods (linear, cubic spline, monotone convex) needed between observed maturities. Real-time implementation requires efficient caching of discount factors. Cross-platform consistency crucial for multi-asset portfolio systems.

Total duration equals sum of key rate durations. This local perturbation approach captures non-parallel yield curve movements that standard duration misses. The formula comes from first-order Taylor expansion of the bond pricing function around the current yield curve. **Key Assumptions and Limitations**: Assumes additive effects of key rate shifts, ignoring correlations between different maturities. Requires small rate changes for derivative approximation validity. Assumes yield curve can be adequately represented by discrete key rates (typically 6-12 points).

Finite difference calculations need careful step size selection (typically 1-5bp). Matrix operations become computationally intensive for large portfolios. Real-time risk systems need efficient caching and incremental recalculation methods. Integration with trading systems requires mapping between key rates and actual market instruments. Validation against historical scenarios crucial for model accuracy.

Attribution analysis needs decomposition by rate environment and vintage effects.

MBS Scheduled Principal Payment,SP_t = MP_t - Interest_t,Fixed Income,Scheduled principal payment calculation for mortgage-backed securities, representing the portion of monthly payment that reduces outstanding balance. **Mathematical Derivation or Foundation**: Total monthly payment MP_t = Interest_t + SP_t where Interest_t = B_{t-1} × WAC/12, SP_t = MP_t - Interest_t. This follows standard loan amortization mathematics. The relationship preserves the accounting identity that all payments are either interest or principal reduction. **Key Assumptions and Limitations**: Assumes fixed monthly payment schedule with no changes in loan terms.
