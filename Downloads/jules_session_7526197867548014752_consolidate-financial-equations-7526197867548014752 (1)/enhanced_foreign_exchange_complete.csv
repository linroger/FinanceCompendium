Garman-Kohlhagen FX Put Option,P = K e^{-r_d T} Φ(-d_2) - S_0 e^{-r_f T} Φ(-d_1),Foreign Exchange,The Garman-Kohlhagen model for pricing European FX put options, extending Black-Scholes to account for different interest rates in domestic and foreign currencies. **Mathematical Foundation**: The model treats FX rate S as domestic currency per unit foreign currency. Put price P = K e^{-r_d T} Φ(-d₂) - S_0 e^{-r_f T} Φ(-d₁) where d₁ = [ln(S_0/K) + (r_d - r_f + σ²/2)T]/(σ√T), d₂ = d₁ - σ√T. **Key Assumptions**: Geometric Brownian motion for FX rate, constant volatility, risk-neutral pricing, no transaction costs. **Practical Applications**: Currency option pricing and hedging, FX risk management, structured FX products, emerging market FX derivatives. **Limitations**: Assumes constant volatility; market exhibits volatility smiles especially for G10 currencies. **Implementation**: Standard Black-Scholes extension; requires domestic/foreign rate curves. **Related Concepts**: Quanto options for cross-currency risk; barrier FX options.
Covered Interest Rate Parity Relationship,F_0 = S_0 e^{(r_d - r_f)T},Foreign Exchange,The fundamental no-arbitrage relationship between spot exchange rates, forward exchange rates, and interest rate differentials between two currencies. **Mathematical Foundation**: CIP states that the forward premium/discount equals the interest rate differential: F_0/S_0 = e^{(r_d - r_f)T}. This follows from constructing synthetic loans that must have equal returns in both currencies. **Key Assumptions**: No transaction costs, no capital controls, perfect capital mobility, risk-neutral investors. **Practical Applications**: FX forward pricing, currency hedging, arbitrage detection, international parity testing. **Limitations**: Empirical violations exist due to credit risk, liquidity, and capital controls. **Implementation**: Bootstrapping from market quotes; used for FX forward curve construction. **Related Concepts**: Uncovered interest parity; purchasing power parity.
Garman-Kohlhagen FX Call Option,C = S_0 e^{-r_f T} Φ(d_1) - K e^{-r_d T} Φ(d_2),Foreign Exchange,The Garman-Kohlhagen model for pricing European FX call options, incorporating the cost of carry difference between domestic and foreign currencies. **Mathematical Foundation**: Call price C = S_0 e^{-r_f T} Φ(d₁) - K e^{-r_d T} Φ(d₂) where the foreign rate r_f discounts the spot price, domestic rate r_d discounts the strike. This reflects the currency of denomination. **Key Assumptions**: Lognormal FX dynamics, constant parameters, European exercise, frictionless markets. **Practical Applications**: FX option trading, currency risk management, structured FX products, volatility trading. **Limitations**: Constant volatility assumption; real markets show term structure and smile. **Implementation**: Direct extension of Black-Scholes; calibration to FX option markets. **Related Concepts**: FX volatility surfaces; quanto adjustments for equity-FX hybrids.
Jarrow-Yildirim Inflation Index Model,dI_t/I_t = (r_n(t) - r_r(t)) dt + σ_I dW_I,Foreign Exchange,Inflation index modeled as a foreign currency with nominal interest rate as domestic and real interest rate as foreign, enabling consistent inflation derivative pricing. **Mathematical Foundation**: The model treats inflation index I_t as analogous to FX rate, with nominal rate r_n as domestic currency, real rate r_r as foreign currency. This gives dI_t/I_t = (r_n - r_r) dt + σ_I dW_I. **Key Assumptions**: Constant volatility, deterministic real rates, arbitrage-free relationship. **Practical Applications**: Inflation-linked derivative pricing, real vs nominal rate arbitrage, inflation risk management. **Limitations**: Assumes specific relationship between rates; empirical validation mixed. **Implementation**: Calibration to inflation swap markets; Monte Carlo for complex products. **Related Concepts**: Breeden-Litzenberger inflation density; inflation volatility surfaces.
Power Reverse Dual Currency Option,V_{PRDC} = Notional × max(∏_{i=1}^n (S_{t_i}/S_0)^{α_i} 0),Foreign Exchange,Structured FX product popular in Japanese retail markets, combining power options with dual currency features and complex path-dependent payoffs. **Mathematical Foundation**: The payoff depends on the product of powered FX ratios over time: ∏_{i=1}^n (S_{t_i}/S_0)^{α_i} where α_i are power coefficients. This creates leveraged, path-dependent exposure to FX movements. **Key Assumptions**: Discrete monitoring dates, deterministic power coefficients, European settlement. **Practical Applications**: Retail FX products, structured notes, exotic FX derivatives, Japanese investment products. **Limitations**: Complex payoff structure; liquidity and pricing challenges. **Implementation**: Monte Carlo simulation; analytical approximations for special cases. **Related Concepts**: Asian options for averaging; lookback options for extrema.
