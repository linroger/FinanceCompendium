Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM),R_i = R_f + β_i (R_m - R_f) + ε_i,Interest Rate Models,The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) provides a fundamental framework for understanding the relationship between expected returns and systematic risk. **Mathematical Foundation**: The model states that expected excess return equals beta times market risk premium: 𝔼[R_i] - R_f = β_i(𝔼[R_m] - R_f), where β_i = Cov(R_i,R_m)/Var(R_m). The full model decomposes realized returns into expected return plus idiosyncratic risk: R_i = 𝔼[R_i] + β_i(R_M - 𝔼[R_M]) + ε_i. **Key Assumptions**: Investors are risk-averse and hold mean-variance efficient portfolios; perfect capital markets with no taxes or transaction costs; investors have homogeneous expectations; unlimited borrowing/lending at risk-free rate. **Practical Applications**: Portfolio optimization, performance evaluation, cost of capital estimation, asset pricing tests, risk-adjusted return calculations (Sharpe ratio, Jensen's alpha). **Limitations**: Assumes single-factor market model may miss other systematic risks; empirical tests show mixed results with anomalies like size and value effects. **Implementation**: Beta estimation via regression of asset returns on market returns; requires long historical data for stable estimates. **Related Concepts**: Multi-factor models like Fama-French extend CAPM to include size and value factors; arbitrage pricing theory generalizes to K-factor models.
