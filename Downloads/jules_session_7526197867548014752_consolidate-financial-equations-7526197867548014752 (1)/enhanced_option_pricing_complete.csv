The derivation involves change of variables and the heat equation, leading to the cumulative normal distribution functions. **Key Assumptions**: Geometric Brownian motion, constant volatility, no dividends, risk-free rate constant, no transaction costs, continuous trading. **Practical Applications**: Used for pricing exchange-traded put options, OTC derivatives, risk management calculations, and as benchmark for more complex models. **Limitations**: Assumes lognormal distribution may not capture fat tails; constant volatility ignores volatility smiles/skews. **Implementation**: d₁ = [ln(S/K) + (r + σ²/2)(T-t)]/(σ√(T-t)), d₂ = d₁ - σ√(T-t). Requires numerical computation of Φ(x) = ∫_{-∞}^x (1/√(2π))e^{-u²/2}du. **Related Concepts**: Call-put parity relationship C - P = S - Ke^{-r(T-t)} ensures consistency with European call pricing.
