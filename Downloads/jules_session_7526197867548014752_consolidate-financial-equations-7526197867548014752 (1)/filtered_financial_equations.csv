Lognormal Jump Size Distribution,ln J_t ~ N(μ_J σ_J²) ̄μ = e^{μ_J + σ_J²/2} - 1,Stochastic Calculus,The lognormal jump size distribution is a fundamental component of Merton's (1976) jump-diffusion model for asset pricing. **Mathematical Foundation**: The jump size J_t follows a lognormal distribution, meaning ln J_t ~ N(μ_J, σ_J²). The expected jump size ̄μ = E[J_t] = e^{μ_J + σ_J²/2} - 1 derives from the moment-generating property of lognormal distributions, where the mean of a lognormal random variable X = e^Y with Y ~ N(μ,σ²) is E[X] = e^{μ + σ²/2}. This formulation ensures jump sizes are always positive and can capture large market movements while maintaining analytical tractability. **Theoretical Basis**: In the Merton model, asset returns follow dS/S = (r - λ̄μ)dt + σdW + (J-1)dN, where λ is jump intensity and N is a Poisson process. The lognormal specification allows for fat-tailed return distributions that better match empirical observations than pure diffusion models. The drift adjustment (r - λ̄μ) compensates for the expected jump impact to maintain risk-neutral pricing. **Key Assumptions**: Jump sizes are independent of the diffusion process and occur at Poisson arrival times. All jumps are multiplicative (percentage changes) rather than additive. The model assumes constant parameters and ignores stochastic volatility-jump interactions. **Limitations**: Underestimates extreme tail events (jumps are too small); cannot capture time-varying jump intensity or volatility smiles in implied volatility surfaces; assumes jumps are uncorrelated with diffusion volatility, which empirical evidence suggests may not hold. **Practical Applications**: Used in volatility modeling for equity indices and individual stocks to capture crash risk; essential for pricing exotic options with barrier or lookback features that are sensitive to large moves; employed in risk management for Value-at-Risk calculations under extreme market conditions; forms basis for more advanced models like Bates (1996) stochastic volatility with jumps. **Related Concepts**: Extends to compound Poisson processes with lognormal jumps; foundation for Lévy process models including Variance Gamma and Normal Inverse Gaussian; connects to catastrophe modeling in insurance where jump sizes represent large loss events; generalizes to time-changed Lévy processes in models like Carr-Wu finite activity approximations. **Implementation Considerations**: Parameters (μ_J, σ_J², λ) estimated via maximum likelihood using historical return data with filtering to identify jump components; numerical methods like Fast Fourier Transform accelerate option pricing when analytical solutions exist; calibration challenges arise from identifiability issues between diffusion and jump parameters; Monte Carlo simulation requires careful discretization of jump times to avoid bias in path-dependent options.

Fokker-Planck Equation,∂p/∂t = -∂/∂S[(r-q)Sp] + ½∂²/∂S²[σ_{LV}² S² p],Stochastic Calculus,The Fokker-Planck equation represents the forward Kolmogorov equation for the evolution of probability density in diffusion processes, particularly under local volatility dynamics. **Mathematical Foundation**: Derived from Itô's lemma applied to the stochastic differential equation dS = (r-q)S dt + σ_LV(S,t) S dW, where σ_LV(S,t) is the deterministic local volatility function. The equation ∂p/∂t = -∂/∂S[μ(S,t)p] + ½∂²/∂S²[σ²(S,t)p] describes how probability mass flows through state space, with the drift term -(r-q)S representing the risk-neutral drift and the diffusion term ½σ_LV²(S,t)S² representing volatility-induced spreading. **Theoretical Basis**: As the forward Kolmogorov equation, it governs the time evolution of the transition density p(S,t|S₀,t₀), satisfying the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation and providing the foundation for Dupire's local volatility formula. **Key Assumptions**: Local volatility is a deterministic function of spot price S and time t; the process is Markovian with continuous paths; no jumps or discontinuities; complete markets under risk-neutral measure; twice continuously differentiable coefficients. **Limitations**: Assumes deterministic volatility (inconsistent with observed stochastic volatility in markets); numerical instability in Dupire's equation inversion; potential arbitrage opportunities if calibrated volatility violates no-arbitrage constraints; breaks down near maturity or extreme strikes; limited applicability to multi-asset or jump-diffusion models. **Practical Applications in Finance**: Central to local volatility modeling for reproducing observed implied volatility surfaces; enables calibration of option pricing models to market data; used in exotic option pricing where Black-Scholes assumptions fail; supports risk management through scenario analysis of probability distributions; facilitates model validation by comparing theoretical vs market-implied densities; enables volatility surface interpolation for unquoted strikes/maturity combinations. **Trading Strategies**: Local volatility models help identify mispriced options by comparing model prices with market quotes; support volatility arbitrage strategies; enable delta-hedging of complex derivatives; facilitate the pricing and hedging of volatility products like variance swaps. **Risk Management Applications**: Assessment of tail risk through probability density evolution; stress testing of derivative portfolios; calculation of Value-at-Risk measures; evaluation of model risk in option pricing; monitoring of volatility surface stability. **Related Concepts and Extensions**: Special case of Black-Scholes PDE when σ_LV is constant; generalized to stochastic volatility models (Heston Fokker-Planck equation with additional state variables); extended to Lévy processes for jump-diffusion models; connects to Dupire's formula σ_LV²(S,t) = (∂C/∂T)/(½S²∂²C/∂K²) for calibration; related to backward Kolmogorov equation (Feynman-Kac) for pricing PDEs; foundation for multi-factor interest rate models; extends to path-dependent volatility models. **Implementation Considerations**: Requires numerical solution via finite difference methods (Crank-Nicolson scheme for stability); Monte Carlo simulation for calibration to market option prices; spectral methods for periodic boundaries; adaptive mesh refinement for accuracy near boundaries; implicit-explicit schemes for stiff equations; parallel computing for high-dimensional extensions. **Calibration Challenges**: Ill-posed inverse problem in Dupire's equation; requires dense option price data across strikes and maturities; sensitivity to market data noise and liquidity; regularization techniques needed to ensure positive definite volatility; iterative optimization methods for parameter fitting. **Computational Challenges**: High computational cost for real-time applications; numerical stability issues near maturity; boundary condition specification at S=0 and large S; memory requirements for multi-dimensional grids; convergence acceleration techniques needed for practical implementation.
