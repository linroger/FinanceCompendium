Lognormal Jump Size Distribution,ln J_t ~ N(μ_J σ_J²) ̄μ = e^{μ_J + σ_J²/2} - 1,Stochastic Calculus,The lognormal jump size distribution is a fundamental component of Merton's (1976) jump-diffusion model for asset pricing. **Mathematical Foundation**: The jump size J_t follows a lognormal distribution, meaning ln J_t ~ N(μ_J, σ_J²). The expected jump size ̄μ = E[J_t] = e^{μ_J + σ_J²/2} - 1 derives from the moment-generating property of lognormal distributions, where the mean of a lognormal random variable X = e^Y with Y ~ N(μ,σ²) is E[X] = e^{μ + σ²/2}. This formulation ensures jump sizes are always positive and can capture large market movements while maintaining analytical tractability. **Theoretical Basis**: In the Merton model, asset returns follow dS/S = (r - λ̄μ)dt + σdW + (J-1)dN, where λ is jump intensity and N is a Poisson process. The lognormal specification allows for fat-tailed return distributions that better match empirical observations than pure diffusion models. The drift adjustment (r - λ̄μ) compensates for the expected jump impact to maintain risk-neutral pricing. **Key Assumptions**: Jump sizes are independent of the diffusion process and occur at Poisson arrival times. All jumps are multiplicative (percentage changes) rather than additive. The model assumes constant parameters and ignores stochastic volatility-jump interactions. **Limitations**: Underestimates extreme tail events (jumps are too small); cannot capture time-varying jump intensity or volatility smiles in implied volatility surfaces; assumes jumps are uncorrelated with diffusion volatility, which empirical evidence suggests may not hold. **Practical Applications**: Used in volatility modeling for equity indices and individual stocks to capture crash risk; essential for pricing exotic options with barrier or lookback features that are sensitive to large moves; employed in risk management for Value-at-Risk calculations under extreme market conditions; forms basis for more advanced models like Bates (1996) stochastic volatility with jumps. **Related Concepts**: Extends to compound Poisson processes with lognormal jumps; foundation for Lévy process models including Variance Gamma and Normal Inverse Gaussian; connects to catastrophe modeling in insurance where jump sizes represent large loss events; generalizes to time-changed Lévy processes in models like Carr-Wu finite activity approximations. **Implementation Considerations**: Parameters (μ_J, σ_J², λ) estimated via maximum likelihood using historical return data with filtering to identify jump components; numerical methods like Fast Fourier Transform accelerate option pricing when analytical solutions exist; calibration challenges arise from identifiability issues between diffusion and jump parameters; Monte Carlo simulation requires careful discretization of jump times to avoid bias in path-dependent options.
