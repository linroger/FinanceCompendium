RIP YCC?

Kuroda holding the door of YCC

The biggest event of the week — and perhaps the month — is clearly going to be the Bank of Japan’s meeting on Wednesday. Sorry Davos.

As our FT colleagues [Leo Lewis and Kana Inagaki](https://www.ft.com/content/80b1246c-afb0-4460-bd5c-37ad19a7858c) mused over the weekend, will the BoJ continue to spray money at markets to defend its new yield target, move it to a more defensible level, or scrap the yield curve control policy altogether?

The scale of the BoJ’s intervention since it widened the allowable 10-year Japanese government bond yield trading band last month is almost comical.

Last week it spent almost Y10tn ($72bn) on Thursday and Friday alone — and still wasn’t able to stop the 10-year JGB yield from trading over the new 0.5 per cent ceiling. That forced a [pre-announcement on Friday](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2023/mpr230113a.pdf) of additional purchases for today, which also doesn’t seem to have fully worked.

We don’t know the scale of today’s intervention yet, but here is an eye-popping chart from the [IIF’s Robin Brooks](https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1613994849270915072?s=20&t=AX_CDCWuyTQFjChe2yd-Fw) showing how that would look if we extrapolate the current monthly pace to the end of January.

So will the exiting BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda be forced to restructure or even kill his signature policy, and what kind of impact would that have globally, given how the BoJ’s YCC still acts as a kind of anchor for global bond yields?

A reminder that the BoJ already owns over half the entire Japanese government bond market. Despite the aggressive purchases last week and more purchases today, the 10-year JGB yield has continued to trade above the new target (it’s at 0.502 per cent at pixel time).

As CLSA’s Nicholas Smith points out, JBG swaps trade at about 100 basis points, indicating that investors are confident that something has to give, and soon.

![](https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A750002c8-d1c9-494f-9c91-4b25f26c48b0?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1)

Deutsche Bank estimates that merely widening the 10-year JGB trading band by another 25 basis points would immediately send the 10-year Treasury yield up by 10 bps as well, while scrapping it “would lead to a more substantial and permanent shift in term premium”.

Perhaps just as importantly, another YCC tweak would turbocharge the Japanese yen, which has already strengthened about 15 per cent versus the dollar just since late October. This will have its own ripple effect (and hammer any unhedged overseas bond purchases by Japanese investors).

Some analysts and investors have noted Japanese media reports that the BoJ is going to review the “side effects” of monetary easing at Wednesday’s meeting. Here’s Goldman Sachs, with FTAV’s emphasis:

> Our economists’ baseline is for the BoJ to maintain YCC, while acknowledging the possibility of further tweaks. **Still, with the BoJ set to upgrade its inflation outlook and continued market pressure, a more concrete shift in policy (or setting of the stage for a future shift) remains a risk.** Markets largely appear to be placing relatively high odds of at least another adjustment to, if not an outright exit from YCC — 10y JPY swap rates are at 1%, and JGBs that the BoJ is not explicitly offering fixed-rate operations on are trading above the upper end of the BoJ’s tolerance band ([Exhibit 4](https://marquee.gs.com/content/research/en/reports/2023/01/13/6ef4b157-16e8-4be0-a008-2754368f016b.html#_cbaec7f8-5970-4000-af4d-914ab1d81000)). Although BoJ purchases have driven the current 10y JGB yields back towards target, the bank bought record amounts of bonds for a second day to enforce its target. To forestall further selling pressure, it also indicated that it would conduct additional fixed rate purchases on Monday (Jan 16th). **However, the elevated pace of buying does not appear to be sustainable and will likely deplete private sector bond market inventories** — implied repo rate of the CTD into JGB futures widened about 5.5%, though not quite to the ~7% level in the run-up to the BoJ meeting last June.

Still, it just *feels* unlikely that Kuroda is going to do anything dramatic on Wednesday? The BoJ governor has been shown a [Hodor-like](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hodor+door+game+of+thrones&atb=v314-1&iax=videos&ia=videos&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXx0wvv3RclY) commitment to defending YCC, and abruptly changing course now wouldn’t be true to form.

Moreover, Kuroda’s term ends in April. Why suddenly scrap your own legacy on the way out of the door when for practical and optical reasons it makes much more sense to let your successor do it?
