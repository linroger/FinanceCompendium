For now....

Pour one out for one of the weirdest macroeconomic phenomenons of all time. From the FT’s Tommy Stubbington [just now](https://www.ft.com/content/35779b15-ca04-441a-bc3f-507b030ed45f):

> The global stock of negative-yielding bonds has dwindled to zero after last month’s unexpected policy shift by the Bank of Japan undermined the last bastion of sub-zero yields.
> 
> Negative yields — which occur when bond prices climb so high that buyers holding them to maturity are guaranteed to lose money — engulfed a broad swath of global fixed-income markets in recent years, with the market value of debt trading at a yield below zero soaring above $18tn in late 2020 after central banks slashed interest rates and launched huge bond-buying programmes in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
> 
> But last year’s abrupt end to the era of easy monetary policy sparked a historic bond sell-off that rapidly shrank the pile, as central banks in the eurozone and Switzerland brought down the curtain on years of negative interest rates.

Behold, a classic vomiting camel chart:

FT Alphaville wrote about the imminent prospect of [zero sub-zero yielding bonds](https://www.ft.com/content/922a3902-58f6-4562-b6b4-89b74d3b048e) back in March last year, when we were a bit sad about the death of something that broke so many macro minds. It was particularly hilarious when even some euro-denominated “high yield” bonds traded at [negative yields](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/negative-yields-are-showing-up-in-europe-s-junk-bond-market).

But now that this era has finally passed, we should take a moment to reflect on how remarkably smooth the demise of negative-yielding debt has been.

Sure, a lot of investors have lost a lot of money etc etc. But that was never really in doubt. A few years back a lot people thought that unwinding all this would inevitably cause financial chaos on a massive scale: bond fund runs, bank collapses, pension fund insolvencies, [human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sED4fzIV0k).

And while it hasn’t been without a few [dicey moments](https://www.ft.com/content/4e6b89a3-a63e-49df-8a04-0488b69e84f5), all things considered it seems to have gone surprisingly well? And now Bonds Have Been Made Great Again!
