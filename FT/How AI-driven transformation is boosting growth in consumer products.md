The consumer products (CP) industry is in flux.

Consumers want value and differentiation from brands, but they also want to feel seen and appreciated. Retailers expect category growth, but they now also need CP companies to collaboratively expand data assets to stimulate that growth. And capital markets, which may have lost some confidence, want CP companies to demonstrate strategic focus and robust financial performance.

These changes, combined with economic pressures, mean that the CP industry is at a crossroads of risk and opportunity. But AI is offering companies a positive, disruptive route for innovating towards growth.

## The shape of things

While AI holds immense potential for negotiating these changes, its impact can only be fully realised when it is deployed as part of a much more integrated business transformation. This extends further than AI technology itself. The emphasis has moved beyond individual use cases to the value and solutions they deliver, both commercially and strategically.

But only by combining AI adoption with integrated business transformation can companies create lasting value and earn the right to win. This transformation needs to be carried out with people in mind, which means organisations must invest in upskilling their workforce. CP companies can then build a culture that embraces radical change in lockstep with AI-led business transformation.

#### AI transformation isn’t about technology adoption, it’s about leadership alignment. When executives create space for experimentation, and make clear what work to stop, it signals that change is a shared priority, not an IT project

### CP leaders invest heavily in AI, but struggle to turn ambition into impact

###### Only 32 per cent see AI, data and analytics as a current competitive advantage

###### Yet just over half (54 per cent) say their AI investments are on track to deliver expected returns

In order to achieve real growth, AI has to be thought of as a core engine for the reinvention of the business, rather than simply a collection of use cases or a toolkit for efficiency. To achieve financial leadership, CP companies should invest for the long term, not just the next quarter.

Consumer products organisations are progressing through various stages of AI adoption – some are experimenting, others are scaling and a few are already integrating AI into core operations. However, this journey is not without obstacles. Regulatory constraints, risk aversion and a lack of decisive leadership continue to hinder progress for many. By leveraging evaluative frameworks and tailored insights, organisations can better understand their current position and chart a clear path forward in their AI evolution.

Becoming truly competitive requires CP companies to overcome the “red queen effect”. When everyone is innovating, matching pace only maintains baseline competitiveness. To outcompete, they must use AI to evolve faster and in brave new ways. AI disruption is a catalyst for transformation and an opportunity for radical change – across the business, the sector and the wider global economy. But there are different stages of maturity.

## Stage 1

## Experimentation

Here, potential is being explored through experimentation and solutions are in development. Sophisticated AI literacy may be limited to a handful of teams and there may not be a formal AI strategy in place. The focus is still on identifying where value can be created, rather than delivering value to consumers.

![](https://ft.com/partnercontent/ey/consumer/assets/images/svg/chips.svg)

CP companies still focused on upgrading tech infrastructure, data governance and AI talent may lag behind those already developing core functions or the operational resilience of the supply chain. The pace of AI evolution may mean operating models and structures will be under pressure. Those with higher-quality, purposeful data and standardised processes will be better equipped to race forward with AI: this may manifest itself in efficiency gains, enhanced insights or faster R&D programmes.

### AI innovation needs to be underpinned by governance

###### promote a culture of trust by enabling teams to propose AI-driven workplace solutions

###### support team decision-making on AI to meet business needs

###### have a designated team for AI policy, risk mitigation and responsible use

Wholesale AI adoption is transformative and therefore requires significant financial investment. Yet, the most successful organisations will be those that are calculated and undaunted about the cultural cost of change – that is, those that are able to shoulder the unsettling effect of a strategic shift while still delivering on KPIs and overarching goals.

#### We didn’t set out to ‘do AI’. We set out to solve real problems and AI became a powerful enabler. This transformation is grounded in executive leadership commitment, cross-functional collaboration and a strong data foundation

## Stage 2

## Preparation

AI is not simply a tool or a new technology: effective AI innovation is a transformative [enterprise enabler](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/consumer-products/how-genai-changes-the-way-cpg-and-retail-operate-and-consumers-too?WT.mc_id=9502211&AA.tsrc=print). This means that it needs organisational change at its heart to facilitate full adoption. AI technology and business strategy need to come together. Without this, companies lack the right to win.

Given that AI is disruptive, trust and risk management need to be at the core of innovation. Explainability, accountability and solid guardrails are paramount for CP companies. Getting this right will help to mitigate the risk inherent in the disruptive potential of AI deployed at scale.

It could also enable companies to make bold, innovative moves by using data and leveraging this against their particular ways of working. For instance, enterprise [digital twins](https://www.emerald.com/bpmj/article-abstract/doi/10.1108/BPMJ-02-2025-0147/1277451/Digital-twins-in-supply-chain-management-a-review?redirectedFrom=fulltext) can be used to optimise the value chain.

Centralised AI platforms that leverage data at scale from across the organisation can power personalised marketing, refine pricing and make supply-chain planning more responsive, Hicks says. AI needs to be deeply woven into decision making and the ways in which CP companies operate; embedding specialised data talent directly into business units is also crucial.

### Agentic AI is still very new: despite emerging adoption, it is far from fully integrated

###### of senior leaders have begun deploying agentic AI

###### But only 14 per cent report full implementation

[Agentic AI](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/consumer-products/agentic-ai-the-future-of-autonomous-consumer-products?WT.mc_id=9502213&AA.tsrc=print), which autonomously performs tasks and adapts to goals, has the potential to revolutionise customer experience and operations in the CP sector. At present, agentic AI is mainly being implemented for assisting or managing processes. To maximise impact, organisations must ensure strong data governance and security to align AI capabilities with business objectives. Equally, data quality need no longer be a barrier to adoption; bringing purpose to this data is key for transforming with clear intent.

#### AI is the engine and data is the fuel, and the unlock is that the fuel no longer needs to be perfect. AI can now clean and refine the data itself, accelerating the entire value cycle

## Stage 3

## Transformation

[EY survey data](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/ai/how-responsible-ai-can-unlock-your-competitive-edge?WT.mc_id=9502216&AA.tsrc=print) shows that, while nearly a third of C-suite leaders say their organisations have fully integrated and scaled AI, 51 per cent admit they struggle to build effective governance frameworks for their current AI technologies. Turning AI potential into real performance demands more than deployment: it calls for reimagining processes; aligning with strategic goals; and investing in data, governance, talent and change management.

![](https://ft.com/partnercontent/ey/consumer/assets/images/svg/transformation.svg)

But AI should be used to make CP companies more intuitive and insightful, not just more efficient. An approach driven solely by use cases – AI for AI’s sake – will not work. It needs to be aligned to the strategic goals of the organisation to enable successful outcomes and return on investment. Companies must scale with purpose by optimising and innovating every step of the way.

Further still, successful AI adoption requires more than just upskilling and capability building – it requires CP companies to give employees a reason to embrace AI. The more disruptive the technology, the more inclusive it needs to be.

Data\_\_

### Upskilling the workforce is vital for innovating with AI

###### predict efficiency gains from AI if employees have the right skills

###### But only 6 per cent of employees are actively exploring how AI can improve work processes

#### To fully realise its potential, companies must embed AI across all levels of the organisation – from the CEO to the front-line teams. All must understand not only the impact and value it can deliver, but also the responsibility that lies with it

The pace and trajectory of AI evolution in the CP sector is not fixed; it will unfold across multiple possible scenarios. Factors such as regulation, consumer trust, investment confidence and organisational readiness will shape how quickly and deeply AI transforms the industry. CP companies must monitor developments closely and anticipate a range of outcomes – from incremental change to full-scale transformation.

Strategic agility will be key. Those able to adapt to shifting conditions and scale AI responsibly will be best positioned to lead in an increasingly autonomous and data-driven marketplace.

The future of consumer products is still being shaped.
