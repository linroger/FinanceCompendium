Donald Trump’s tariff threat to Lesotho shows the danger of relying on preferential trade access

America gives, and America takes away. Ask Lesotho. Twenty years ago the US showered the impoverished diminutive southern African kingdom with development assistance and access to the vast US consumer market. Now, the combination of Donald Trump’s impossibly high tariffs and his destruction of the US aid budget are [trashing the clothing industry](https://www.ft.com/content/6175a0d0-cc8d-4d65-ad25-a1e13398403d) that it has painstakingly built up since.

Lesotho is an extreme example of the threat to developing economies, including the low-income [least developed countries](https://unctad.org/topic/least-developed-countries/list), from the absurd mechanical formula that set Trump’s so-called “reciprocal” tariffs. Lesotho is threatened with 50 per cent duties, suspended until August 1. The Trump tariffs are also menacing other LDC garment manufacturers like [Bangladesh and Cambodia](https://www.tradecomplianceresourcehub.com/2025/07/17/trump-2-0-tariff-tracker/) (35 and 36 per cent duties respectively) as well as more obvious targets like China and Vietnam.

Tariffing Lesothan exports to reduce the country’s trade surplus with the US is obscene. Its small clothing companies pose no real competitive threat to America’s few remaining textile and garment producers. The episode illustrates a wider point. Punting your country’s economic future on the kindness of strangers in the form of trade preferences creates uncomfortable risk.

The full-spectrum help given to Lesotho in the 2000s reflected the country’s inherent challenges. It’s a small mountainous nation totally surrounded by South Africa and remote from any ports, and in 2005 [around a quarter](https://www.prb.org/geographical-focus/lesotho/) of adults were living with HIV/Aids. The fragility of Lesotho’s export sector reflects problems common to many poor economies including a lack of infrastructure and access to transport.

The African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) trade preference scheme, which became law in 2000, used generous [rules of origin](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/aldcinf2023d2_en.pdf) (ROOs) to allow Lesotho to import fabric and yarn and add a relatively small proportion of total value before exporting to the US. President George W Bush’s Pepfar aid programme to treat HIV/Aids in developing countries made Lesotho one of the [early recipients](https://2001-2009.state.gov/s/gac/rl/or/68762.htm).

The voluntary and private sector also weighed in. The clothes company Gap chose Lesotho to [make its Product Red clothing](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/16/5), which raised money for HIV/Aids relief, a project fronted by the rock star Bono. In 2006, having just watched a fashion show in Lesotho, Bono told me: “I saw these beautiful golden royal Africans and I thought: God, this is just such a sexy place, and it can be sexier than the competition.”

That sex appeal is fading. Aid and trade access are being snatched away. Though the US Senate may just have [saved Pepfar](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5405515-senate-trump-cuts-global-aid-public-broadcasting-rescissions/) from the wrecking ball, other assistance is being slashed — Trump [sneered about US aid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0q18x0192yo) to Lesotho during an address to Congress — and his tariffs will swamp the benefits of Agoa. Gap is no longer [listed as a Product Red partner](https://www.red.org/partnerships/) and says it no longer sources from Lesotho.

Colette van der Ven of the Tulip trade consultancy told me that the generosity of ROOs allowed foreign garment manufacturers, particularly Taiwanese, to alight in Lesotho and produce along a small part of the supply chain. But that limited footprint means they can also quickly take wing. Low-cost labour-intensive export manufacturing was a key part of the development strategies of many countries, China the most obvious example. However, unlike Lesotho, China built up enough infrastructure and human capital to go up the ladder and diversify into other, more value-added, industries.

Van der Ven notes a me-too mentality in many developing countries, which have created a simulacrum of China’s success by aiming to attract export-oriented foreign direct investment, often into special economic zones with light taxes and regulations. But that production is vulnerable if it fails to form value chains within the wider domestic economy.

Other exporters such as Cambodia have already faced the loss of preferential trade access, in their case to the EU, though on a much smaller scale. Brussels, which conditions some of its preferential access on human rights and environmental standards, in 2000 [withdrew trade privileges](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/cambodia-eu-partially-withdraws-trade-preferences-over-rights-concerns-stakeholders-respond/) from some Cambodian products as a result of the Cambodian government’s record on human rights. The EU has also disgracefully [tried to use](https://www.ft.com/content/158c5af4-79a0-46f2-91e5-35e4ca20abcd) a trade preference scheme to compel poor countries to admit failed asylum seekers, an issue that has nothing to do with trade.

Cambodia and Bangladesh, which are both LDCs, are now becoming rich enough to “graduate” from LDC status and hence will lose eligibility for some of the most generous preferences. Still, they have a sufficiently competitive industry and diverse export base that they will be able to ride the US tariffs with much more comfort than Lesotho. Cambodia’s exports to the US are [outweighed by](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/statis_maps_iframe_e.htm?country_selected=KHM&optionSelected=3) the combined value of its sales to other rich economies including the EU, the UK, Japan and Singapore. The UK in particular deserves credit for recently [reforming its preference schemes](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/trading-with-developing-nations) to be more generous than the EU ones it inherited after Brexit.

Engagement with international trade remains one of the main ways in which low-income countries can increase productivity and growth. But relying on one particular export market and specific trade privileges to access it, always a risky business, has got a lot more dangerous under a trade policy set by Trump.
