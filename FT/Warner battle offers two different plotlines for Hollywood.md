Whether Netflix or Paramount wins, creatives are likely to lose

The cliché of the moment is that Hollywood could not have scripted the bid battle for Warner Bros Discovery. In fact, [Hollywood](https://www.ft.com/film) has a long history of writing and shooting movies and TV series about itself, from *Sunset Boulevard* to Seth Rogen’s *The Studio*. The question, though, is whether either of the [rival bidders, Netflix and Paramount Skydance](https://www.ft.com/content/9a6183f3-4d02-4add-85ec-69f337697616), will leave behind enough writers to prepare a future screenplay.

The bids could unleash more disruption on Hollywood’s “creatives” — directors, producers, writers, actors and crew — and the wider movie-theatre sector. “There is no preferred winner,” Michele Mulroney, president of the Writers Guild of America West, [said](https://theankler.com/p/wga-prez-dire-warning-on-netflix?hide_intro_popup=true) this week. “Our belief here is that whoever wins, writers lose.”

This is another violent aftershock for the industry following the seismic interruption of Covid-19, which drove viewers into the arms of streamers such as Netflix. Then came the writers’ and actors’ strikes in 2023, competition from alternative entertainment sources such as YouTube, and the tectonic shift triggered by generative artificial intelligence.

Both bidders deny Hollywood as a whole will suffer if they win over WBD’s board and investors. David Ellison, Paramount chief executive, says its deal is “ [pro-consumer... pro-creative talent... pro-competition](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/cnbc-transcript-paramount-skydance-chairman-ceo-david-ellison-speaks-with-cnbcs-david-faber-on-squawk-on-the-street-today.html) ”. To reassure those who believe consolidation could accelerate the shift from big to small screen, Paramount has committed to release 30 movies in theatres annually. Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos has argued that his company, which lacks a strong Hollywood studio presence, will create, not cut, jobs. Netflix has also retreated a little from its self-interested scepticism about cinema distribution of new films.

The industry knows, however, that job losses have ensued whenever a studio has been taken over in recent years. A reduction in Hollywood’s gatekeepers is likely to put more pressure on what creatives are paid, and their prospects of being employed at all. Meanwhile, having accustomed viewers to easy availability of new releases at home, getting them off the sofa and back into theatres is a daunting challenge.

Paramount’s bid seems the more Hollywood-friendly. But the consortium behind it includes elements politically unpalatable to LA’s creative community, including Saudi backers and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Netflix could deploy its technological experience to future-proof Hollywood and take on YouTube, but the temptation to take Warner’s back catalogue and supercharge it with AI would be strong. Film studios were once the very definition of a business whose most important assets walked off the lot every night. AI agents could, in future, be set to work 24/7, writing, making and distributing films and TV for Netflix and others to stream.

Arguably nobody would benefit from such a dystopia, least of all the discerning TV or movie viewer. In France, such a threat to the film industry would probably be sufficient to justify state intervention. In the US, an antitrust review will be complicated by President Trump’s determination [to be “involved”](https://www.ft.com/content/bbfebdc3-80ce-4dec-b88d-94535a63ed14), even though he should recuse himself. There is also the more academic challenge of how to apply [traditional measures of competition](https://www.ft.com/content/2e56f267-309a-408d-a8e9-1571907f6a46) that focus on price, when share of viewers’ attention or quality of programming may be more relevant. Reviewing a winning bid could take months, chilling live negotiations on movie and TV projects.

The next scenes of this drama will unfold in the WBD boardroom and among shareholders, who by rights will be the ones to determine the immediate outcome. The winning bidder will doubtless argue that when the lights come up, Hollywood will still be Hollywood, but perhaps — to paraphrase a quote from the Paramount-owned Star Trek franchise — not as we know it.
