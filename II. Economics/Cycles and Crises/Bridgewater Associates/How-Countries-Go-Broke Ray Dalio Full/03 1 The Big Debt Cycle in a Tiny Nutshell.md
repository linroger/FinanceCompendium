# Chapter 1: The Big Debt Cycle in a Tiny Nutshell

Part I provides a comprehensive picture of the Big Debt Cycle, which has occurred again and again throughout history but isn't widely recognized because big shifts in it come along so infrequently, only about once in a lifetime. The purpose of this part is to describe how the natural mechanics of money, credit, debt, and economic activity, combined with human nature, add up over time to create the Big Debt Cycle. In it, I explain the stages of how the Big Debt Cycle progresses and what happens when it unravels. In the first chapter, I provide an overview of how the cycle unfolds in a nutshell, and in the following two chapters, I dive into more detail, explaining the mechanics that drive the debt cycle both in words and concepts and in numbers and equations. These chapters have a lot for both the general reader and the investor, and I'd encourage you to either read just the bold or explore the details as it suits you.

### CHAPTER 1

### THE BIG DEBT CYCLE IN A TINY NUTSHELL

My goal for this chapter is to convey a very brief but complete description of the mechanics of a typical Big Debt Cycle. If you read only one chapter to understand how debt works, this is the one to read.

### HOW THE MACHINE WORKS

Credit is the primary vehicle for funding spending, and it can easily be created. Because one person's spending is another's earnings, when there is a lot of credit creation, people spend and earn more, most asset prices go up, and most everyone loves it. As a result, central governments and central banks have a bias toward creating a lot of credit. Credit also creates debt that has to be paid back, which has the opposite effect—i.e., when debts have to be paid back, it creates less spending, lower incomes, and lower asset prices, which people don't like. In other words, when someone (a borrower-debtor) borrows money (called principal) at a cost (an interest rate), the borrower-debtor can spend more money than they have in earnings and savings over the near term. But over the long term, this requires them to pay back the principal plus interest, and when they have to pay it back, it requires them to spend less money than they have. This dynamic is why the credit/spending/debt-paying-back dynamic is inherently cyclical.

### THE SHORT-TERM DEBT CYCLE

Everyone who has been around long enough to be affected by it several times should be well-acquainted with the short-term debt cycle. It starts with money and credit being provided readily when economic activity and inflation are lower than desired, and when interest rates are low relative to inflation rates and low in relation to the rates of return on other investments. Those conditions encourage borrowing to spend and invest, which causes asset prices, economic activity, and inflation to pick up until they are higher than desired, at which time money and credit are restrained, and interest rates become relatively high in relation to inflation rates and rates of return on other investments. This leads to less borrowing to spend and invest, which leads to lower asset prices, a slowing of economic activity, and lower inflation, which leads interest rates to come down, money and credit to become easier, and the cycle to begin again. These cycles have typically lasted about six years, give or take three years.

### SHORT-TERM DEBT CYCLES ADD UP TO BIG, LONG-TERM DEBT CYCLES

What isn't paid enough attention is the way in which these short-term debt cycles add up to big, long-term debt cycles. Because credit is a stimulant that creates a high, people want more of it, so there is a bias toward creating it. This leads debt to rise over time, which typically leads to most of the short-term cyclical highs and lows in debt to be higher than the ones before. These add up to create the long-term debt cycle, which ends when it becomes unsustainable. The capacity to take on more debt is different early in the Big Debt Cycle when debt burdens are lower and there is more potential for debt/credit to be able to fund highly profitable endeavors than it is later in the Big Debt Cycle when debt burdens are higher, and lenders have fewer productive options.

In that early stage, it is easy to borrow—even to borrow a lot—and pay it back. These early short-term debt cycles are primarily driven by the previously described availability and economics of borrowing and spending, and also a lingering cautiousness brought about by memories of the pain of the most recent time when money was tight.[2] Early in the Big Debt Cycle, when debts and total debt service are relatively low in relation to incomes and other assets, increases and decreases in credit, spending, debt, and debt service are primarily determined by the previously described incentives with less risk. But late in the Big Debt Cycle, when debts and debt service costs get high relative to income and the value of other assets that can be used to meet one's debt service obligations, the risks of default are higher. Also, late in the Big Debt Cycle, when there are a lot of debt assets and liabilities relative to income, the balancing act of trying to keep interest rates high enough to satisfy lender-creditors without having them too high for borrower-debtors becomes more challenging. That's because one person's debts are another's assets and both must be satisfied. So, while short-term debt cycles end because of the previously described economic considerations, long-term debt cycles end because the debt burdens are too great to be sustained. Said differently, because it is more enjoyable to borrow and spend, if one isn't careful, debt and debt service can grow like a cancer, eating up one's buying power and squeezing out other consumption. This is what makes the long-term Big Debt Cycle.

Throughout the millennia and across countries, what has driven the Big Debt Cycle and has created the big market and economic problems that go along with it is the creation of unsustainably large amounts of debt assets and debt liabilities relative to the amounts of money, goods, services, and investment assets in existence.

Said more simply,  $\bullet$  A debt is a promise to deliver money. A debt crisis occurs when there have been more promises made than there is money to deliver on them. When that happens, the central bank is forced to choose between a) printing a lot of money, which devalues it, and b) not printing a lot of money and having a big debt default crisis. In the end, the central bank always prints and devalues. But either way—either via default or devaluation—the creation of too much debt eventually causes debt assets (e.g., bonds) to be worth less.

While there are variations in how each of these cases plays out, the most important factor is whether the debt is denominated in a currency that the central bank can "print" and whether it is a reserve currency. But no matter the variation, we almost always see that it becomes relatively undesirable to hold the debt assets (e.g., bonds) relative to holding the productive capacity of the economy (e.g., equities) and/or owning other, more stable forms of money (e.g., gold).

To me, it is interesting and inappropriate that when credit rating agencies rate the credit of a central government, they don't rate the riskiness of its debt losing value. They only rate the risk of default on the debt, which gives the misimpression that all higher-rated debt is a safe storehouse of value. Said differently, because a central bank can bail out a central government, the riskiness of central government debts is hidden. Creditors would be better served if the rating agencies rated the riskiness of the debt losing value through both default and devaluation. After all, these bonds are supposed to be storehouses of wealth and should be rated as such. As you will see in this study, that is how I look at bonds. For countries with debts denominated in their own currencies (i.e., in a currency they can print), I rate their central governments' debts separately from their central banks' debts to show how risky they are, and I rate the risks of central banks' debts by considering the risk of the devaluation of money to be as, if not more, probable than a default on government debt.

Default or devaluation, I don't care. What I care about is losing my storehouse of wealth, which inevitably will happen one way or another.

### FOLLOWING THE DEBT CYCLE'S PROGRESSION

The main difference between a short-term debt cycle and a long-term debt cycle has to do with the central bank's ability to turn them around. For the short-term debt cycle, its contraction phase can be reversed with a heavy dose of money and credit that brings the economy up from a depressed disinflationary state because the economy has the capacity to produce another phase of non-inflationary growth. But the long-term debt cycle's contraction phase cannot be reversed by producing more money and credit because existing levels of debt growth and debt assets are unsustainable, and holders of debt assets want to get out of them because they believe that one way or another, they will be poor storehouses of wealth.

Think of the Big Debt Cycle's progression like the progression of a disease or a life cycle through stages that exhibit different symptoms. By identifying these symptoms, one can identify approximately where the cycle is in its progression with some expectations of how it is likely to progress from there. Described most simply, the Big Debt Cycle moves from sound/hard money and credit to increasingly loose money and credit to a debt bust that leads to a return to sound/hard money and credit brought about by necessity. More specifically, at first, there is healthy borrowing by the private sector that can be paid back; then the private sector overborrows, has losses, and has problems paying it back; then the government sector tries to help, overborrows, has losses, and has problems paying it back; then the central bank tries to help by "printing money" and buying the government debt, and has problems paying it back, which leads it to monetize a lot more debt if it can (i.e., if the debt is denominated in a currency that it can print). Though not all cases progress in exactly the same way, most cases progress through the following five stages.

### The Sound Money Stage

When net debt levels are low, money is sound, the country is competitive, and debt growth fuels productivity growth, which creates incomes that are more than enough to pay back the debts. This leads to increases in financial wealth and confidence.

- Credit is the promise to deliver money. Unlike credit, which requires a payment of money at a later date, money settles transactions—i.e., if money is given, the transaction is complete, whereas if credit is given, money is owed. It's easy to create credit. Anyone can create credit, but not anyone can create money. For example, I can create credit by accepting your promise to pay me money even if you don't have the money. As a result, credit easily grows, so there is much more credit than there is money. The most effective money is both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth that is widely accepted around the world. At the early stage of the Big Debt Cycle, money is "hard," which means that it is a medium of exchange that is also a storehold of wealth that can't easily be increased in supply, such as gold, silver, and more recently Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are now emerging as accepted hard currencies because they are widely accepted around the world and are limited in supply. The biggest, most common risk to money becoming an ineffective storehold of wealth is the risk that a lot of it will be created. Imagine having the ability to create money; who wouldn't be tempted to do a lot of that? Those who can always are. That creates the Big Debt Cycle. In the early part of the Big Debt Cycle, a) money is typically hard, and the paper money that circulates is convertible into the "hard money" at a fixed price, and b) there isn't a lot of paper money and debt (which is the promise to pay money) outstanding. The Big Debt Cycle consists of the building up of a) "paper money" and debt assets/liabilities relative to b) "hard money" and real assets (e.g., goods and services) and relative to the income that is required to service the debt. Basically, the Big Debt Cycle works like a Ponzi scheme or musical chairs with investors holding an increasing amount of debt assets in the belief that they can convert them into money that will have buying power to get real things, yet as the amount of the debt assets that are held up by that faith increases relative to the real things, that conversion becomes more obviously impossible until that is realized and the process of selling the debt to get the hard money and real assets begins.
- At the early stage of the debt cycle, private and government debt and debt service ratios are 1) low relative to incomes and/or 2) low relative to liquid assets. For example, government debt and debt service are low relative to government tax revenue and/or low relative to government liquid assets (e.g., reserves and other savings such as sovereign wealth assets) that can easily be converted into money. When the Big Debt Cycle that we are in began in 1945, the ratios of US government debt and US money supply divided by the amount of gold the US government had were equal to $7\times$ and $1.3\times$, respectively, whereas now these ratios are $37\times$ and $6\times$, respectively.
- During this early stage in the cycle, debt levels, debt growth, economic growth, and inflation are neither too hot nor too cold and finances are sound.
- At this stage in the cycle, "risky assets" are relatively inexpensive relative to "safe" assets. That is because the memories of the prior period in which there was great damage done affect psychology and pricing. For example, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, stock earnings yields were roughly $4\times$ that of bond yields.
- During this stage, there is a healthy economy and good investment returns that lead to the next stage.

### The Debt Bubble Stage

When debt and investment growth are greater than can be serviced from the incomes being produced.

- In this stage, money is readily available and cheap, and there is a debt-financed economic expansion and an economic boom. Demands for and prices of goods, services, and investment assets are driven up by a lot of debt-financed buying, sentiment is very bullish, and by most conventional measures, the market is overpriced.
- In this stage, there are typically amazing new inventions that are truly transformative that investors invest in without an ability or care to assess whether the present value of their future cash flows will be greater or less than their costs.

There is always a current most popular meme that just about everyone believes. It is reflected in the price and is bound to be wrong in some way. These memes typically are due to a mix of extrapolating what happened before and emotional considerations. Also, most investors typically don't take into consideration market pricing. In other words, they tend to identify what has been a great investment (e.g., a strongly performing company) as great, and they don't pay enough attention to its pricing, even though its pricing (whether it is cheap or expensive) is the most important thing. At this time, it is typical for almost everyone to be looking to make money by buying assets that they believe will go up (rather than betting on them going down), and they quite often use leverage.

- This dynamic eventually produces a bubble that is reflected in the rates of debt and debt service growth to finance speculation being greater than the income growth rates that are needed to service the debts. In this stage, markets and economies seem great, most everyone believes that they will get better, they are financed by a lot of borrowing, and "wealth" is created out of nothing. By wealth being created out of nothing, I mean that there is greater imagined wealth versus actual wealth.

existing wealth. For example, bubble periods are identifiable by extensive periods of debt growth (e.g., three years) that is significantly faster than income growth, high asset prices relative to traditional measures of the present values of likely future cash flows, and many other factors that I measure in my bubble indicator. (You can find an article describing the indicator at economicprinciples.org and in the Principles In Action app.) A contemporary example is the unicorn company that is valued at over \$1 billion that has made the owner a "billionaire" on paper but has only raised \$50 million in capital because speculative venture capitalists put in the money to get option-like chips in case it does well. Bubbles can go on for a while before the top is made, but they inevitably lead to the next stage.

- Then there comes a time when the debt spiral reaches and goes beyond the point of no return, by which I mean the debt and debt service levels go beyond those that can be prevented from accelerating without great losses to debt investors. This self-reinforcing debt "death spiral" occurs when there is a need to borrow in order to service the debt at a time when interest rates are rising because the risks of holding the debt/currency have become apparent to investors, which leads to a debt crisis.

### The Top Stage

When the bubble pops and there is a debt/credit/market/economic contraction.

- The popping of the bubble typically occurs due to a combination of a tightening of money and the prior rate of debt growth being unsustainable. It is just that simple.
- When the bubble pops, a self-reinforcing contraction begins so the debt problems spread very quickly, like an aggressive cancer, so it is very important for policymakers to deal with

It quickly, either to reverse it or to guide the deleveraging to its conclusion. In most cases, the debt contraction can be temporarily reversed by giving the system a heavy dose of what caused the debt problem—i.e., by creating more credit and debt. That continues until it can't continue anymore, at which time a big deleveraging occurs.

### The Deleveraging Stage

When there is a painful bringing down of debt and debt service levels to be in line with income levels so that the debt levels are sustainable.

- At the beginning of the last stage of the Big Debt Cycle when there is a big debt crisis, debt problems typically spread from the private sector to the central government and then to the central bank. ● Net selling of debt assets, especially net selling of government debt assets, is a big red flag. When that happens, conditions deteriorate quickly unless managed very well and very quickly by central governments and central banks. At that time, private holders of debt sell the debt fearing bad returns. That selling takes the form of "runs on banks." By "runs on banks," I mean the turning-in of debt assets to get real money, which lenders/banks don't have enough of. When debt problems become apparent and the holders of the debt assets sell their debt assets, that initially drives interest rates on the debt up. This makes the debt more difficult to service, hence more risky, which drives interest rates higher. At that point, the central bank typically provides money and credit to fill in for the inadequate demand, which reduces the value of money and credit and reduces credit risk.
- The selling of the government's debt leads to a) a free-market-driven tightening of money and credit, which leads to b) a weakening of the economy, c) downward pressure on the currency, and d) declining reserves as the central bank attempts to defend the currency. Classically, these runs accelerate and feed on themselves as holders of debt assets see that, one way or another (through default or through the devaluation of their money), they will lose the buying power that they had believed was stored in these debt assets, causing great shifts in market values and wealth until debts are defaulted on, restructured, and/or monetized. Because this tightening proves too harmful for the economy, the central bank eventually simultaneously eases credit and allows a devaluation of the currency. The devaluation of money can itself be the reason to sell the debt asset because it becomes a poor storehold of wealth. So, whether there is a tightening of money that leads to debt defaults and a bad economy or an easing of money that produces a devaluation of money and debt assets, it is not good for the debt asset. This dynamic creates what is called a debt "death spiral" because it is a self-reinforcing, debt-contraction dynamic in which the rising interest rates cause problems that creditors see, leading them to sell the debt assets, which leads to even higher interest rates or the need to print more money, which devalues the money and leads to even more selling of the debt assets and the currency and so on until the spiral runs its course. When this happens to government debt, the realization that too much debt is the problem naturally leads to the inclination to cut spending and borrowing. However, because one person's spending is another person's income, cutting spending at such times typically only contributes to increases in debt-to-income ratios. That is typically when policies are shifted to a mix of debt restructurings and debt monetizations, with the mix chosen primarily dependent on how much of the debt is denominated in the country's currency. This defaulting on, restructuring of, and/or monetizing of debt reduces the debt burdens relative to incomes until a new equilibrium is reached. The movement to a stable equilibrium typically takes place via a few painful adjustments.

Spasms because borderline financial soundness is achieved before secure financial soundness.

- Classically, the deleveraging process progresses as follows. Early in this recession/depression phase, central banks bring interest rates down and make credit more available. However, when a) debts are large and a debt contraction is underway, b) interest rates can't be lowered anymore (e.g., when they fall to around $0\%$), c) there is not enough demand for government debt, and d) the monetary easing is not enough to offset the self-reinforcing depressionary pressures, the central bank is forced to switch to new "tools" to stimulate the economy. Classically, to stimulate the economy, the central bank must lower interest rates to below nominal economic growth rates, inflation rates, and bond rates, but that is difficult to do when they approach $0\%$. At the same time, the central government is typically getting itself into a lot more debt because tax revenues are down and spending is up to support the private sector, yet there is not enough private sector demand to buy that debt. The central government experiences a debt squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt falls short of the supply of it. If there is net selling of the debt, that creates a much worse problem.
- Often in this deleveraging stage of the cycle, there is a "pushing on a string," a phrase coined by policymakers in the 1930s. It occurs late in the long-term debt cycle when central bankers struggle to convert their stimulative policies into increased spending because savers, investors, and businesses fear borrowing and spending and/or there is deflation, so the risk-free interest rate that they are getting is relatively attractive to them. At such times, it is difficult to get people to stop saving in "cash" even when interest rates go to $0\%$ (or even below $0\%$). This phase is characterized by the economy entering a deflationary, weak, or negative growth period as people and investors hoard low-risk, typically government-guaranteed cash.
- At this stage, central banks must choose between keeping money "hard," which will lead debtors to default on their debts, which will lead to deflationary depressions, or making money "soft" by printing a lot of it, which will devalue both it and the debt. Because paying off debt with hard money causes such severe market and economic downturns, when faced with this choice, central banks always eventually choose to print and devalue money. Of course, each country's central bank can only print that country's money, which brings me to my next big point.
- At this stage, if it has the ability to "print money," the central bank creates a substantial amount of money and credit and throws it aggressively at the markets. It typically buys government debt and private sector debt of systemically important entities that are at risk of defaulting (in order to make up for the private sector's inadequate demand for debt and to keep interest rates artificially low), and it sometimes buys equities and creates incentives for people to buy goods, services, and financial assets. At this stage, it is also typically desirable to devalue the currency because that is stimulative to the economy and raises inflation rates, thus negating the deflationary pressures. If the currency is linked to gold, silver, or something else, that link is typically broken and there is a move to a fiat monetary system. If the currency isn't linked—i.e., if the currency is already a fiat currency—devaluing it relative to other storeholds of wealth and other currencies is helpful. In some cases, the central bank's moves can drive nominal interest rates higher, either because the central bank tightens monetary policy to fight inflation or because it doesn't tighten money to fight inflation and holders of the debt don't want to buy the newly issued government debt and/or they want to sell it because it doesn't provide an adequate return. It is important to watch real and nominal interest rates and the supply and demand for debt to understand what is happening.
- At such times, extraordinary policies to get money like imposing extraordinary taxes and capital controls become common. It has also often been the case that governments will adopt policies that would have previously seemed unimaginable, such as selectively freezing or seizing the assets of "enemy" countries or creating new forms of money. Note that I am not saying that these extraordinary measures always happen; I'm only saying that it is wise to carefully consider the possibility that they will happen.
- This deleveraging stage is typically a painful time when debt burdens are reduced by defaults, restructurings, and/or devaluations. This is when an aggressive mix of debt restructurings and debt monetizations inevitably takes place to reduce the debt and debt service burdens relative to incomes. In a typical deleveraging, the debt-to-income ratio has to be lowered by roughly $50\%$, give or take about $20\%$. It can be done well or poorly. When it is done well, which I call a "beautiful deleveraging," central governments and central banks simultaneously do both debt restructurings and monetary stimulations in a balanced way. The restructurings reduce debt burdens and are deflationary, while the monetary stimulations also reduce debt burdens (by providing money and credit to make it easier to buy debt) but are inflationary and stimulative to the economy, so if they get the balance right, positive growth occurs with falling debt burdens and acceptable inflation. Whether done well or poorly, this is the stage of the Big Debt Cycle that reduces a lot of the debt burden and establishes the bottom that can be built on to begin the next Big Debt Cycle.

### The Big Debt Crisis Recedes

When a new equilibrium is reached, and a new cycle begins.

- In order to have a viable debt/credit/money system, it is imperative that a) debt/money is sound enough to be a viable storehouse of wealth, b) debt and debt service burdens are in line with the incomes to service them so that debt growth is sustainable, c) creditors and debtors both believe that those things will exist, and d) the availability of money and credit and real interest rates begin to fall in line with that which is needed by both lender-creditors and borrower-debtors. There is movement toward these things happening in the late phase of the Big Debt Cycle. It requires both psychological and fundamental adjustments. After a big deleveraging, it is typically difficult to convince lender-creditors to lend because the devaluations/restructurings they experienced in the deleveraging make them risk-averse, so it is imperative that the central government and the central bank take credibility-restoring actions. These generally involve bringing their finances in order by a) the central government earning more money than it spends and/or b) the central bank making money hard again by offering high real yields, raising reserves, and/or linking the currency to something hard like gold or a strong currency. Typically, in this stage, interest rates need to be relatively high in relation to inflation rates and more than high enough to compensate for currency weakness, so it pays to be a lender and is costly to be a borrower. This stage of the cycle can be very attractive for lender-creditors.

The stage that the Big Debt Cycle is in is also reflected in the types of monetary policies being used. As the Big Debt Cycle progresses, central banks have to change how they run monetary policy in order to keep the debt/credit/economic expansion going, so by observing what type of monetary policy they are using, one can surmise what stage the Big Debt Cycle is in. The phases in monetary policy and the conditions that lead to them are as follows:

### Phase 1: A Linked (i.e., Hard) Monetary System (MP0).

This is the type of monetary policy that existed from 1945 until 1971. This type of monetary policy ends when the debt bubble bursts, and there is the previously described "run on the bank" dynamic, which is a run from credit assets to the hard money, and the limited amount of hard money causes massive defaults. This creates a compelling desire to print money rather than leave the supply of it limited by the supply of the gold or hard money that exists to be exchanged at the promised price.

### Phase 2: A Fiat Money, Interest-Rate-Driven Monetary

Policy (MP1). During this phase, interest rates, bank reserves, and capital requirements are also controllers of the amounts of debt/credit growth. This fiat monetary policy phase both allows more flexibility and provides less assurance that money printing won't be so large that it will devalue money and debt assets. The US was in this phase from 1971 until 2008. It ends when interest rate changes no longer work (e.g., interest rates hit $0\%$ and there is a need to ease monetary policy) and/or the private market demand for the debt being created falls short of the supply being sold so that, if the central bank did not print the money and buy the debt, money and credit would be tighter and interest rates would be higher than desired.

### Phase 3: A Fiat Monetary System with Debt Monetization

(MP2). This type of monetary policy is implemented by the central bank using its ability to create money and credit to buy investment assets. It is the go-to alternative when interest rates can no longer be lowered and when private market demand for debt assets (mostly bonds and mortgages, though it can also include other financial assets like equities) is not large enough to buy the supply at an acceptable interest rate. It is good for financial asset prices, so it tends to disproportionately benefit those who have financial assets. It doesn't effectively deliver money into the hands of those who are most stressed financially, and it isn't very targeted. The US was in this phase from 2008 until 2020.

### Phase 4: A Fiat Monetary System with a Coordinated Big Fiscal Deficit and Big Debt Monetization Policy (MP3).

This type of monetary policy is used when, in order to make the system work well, central government fiscal policy and central bank monetary policy have to be coordinated in order to get money and credit into the hands of the people and entities that need it most. While creating money and credit typically temporarily alleviates the debt problem, it does not rectify the problem.

Phase 5: A Big Deleveraging. This is when there must be a big reduction in debt and debt service payments through a debt restructuring and/or a debt monetization. When managed in the best possible way—what I call a beautiful deleveraging—the deflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., through debt re-structurings) are balanced with the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., by monetizing them), so that the deleveraging occurs without having unacceptable amounts of either deflation or inflation. The Big Debt Cycle sequence to keep in mind is: first the private sector overborrows, has losses, and has problems paying it back (i.e., a debt crisis); then, to help out, the government overborrows, has losses, and has problems paying it back; then, to help out, the central bank buys the government debt and takes losses. To fund those purchases and to fund other debtors

In trouble (because it is the "lender of last resort"), the central bank prints a lot of money and buys a lot of debt. Then, at its worst, the central bank loses a lot of money on the debt it bought.

- While it is said that a modern central bank "prints" money to buy the debt, the central bank doesn't literally "print money." Instead, it borrows money (reserves) from commercial banks that it pays a very short-term interest rate on. At this dynamic's most extreme, the central bank can lose money because the interest earnings it gets on the debt it bought are less than the interest that it has to pay out on the money it borrowed. When these amounts become large, it can find itself in a self-reinforcing spiral of having to buy debt, which leads it to have losses and negative cash flows, which leads it to need to print more money to service its debt and to need to buy more debt, which ends up having more losses, which requires it to do more of the same. This is the death spiral I mentioned earlier. When done in large amounts, the "printing" devalues the money and creates inflationary recessions or depressions. If interest rates rise, the central bank loses money on its bond holdings because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the interest rate that it receives on the debt assets it bought. This is notable but not a big red flag until the central bank has a very large negative net worth and is forced to "print" more money to cover the negative cash flow that it experiences due to less money coming in on its assets than has to go out to service its liabilities. That is what I mean when I say the central bank goes broke: while the central bank doesn't default on its debts, it can't make its debt service payments without printing money.
- Eventually, the debt restructurings and debt monetizations reduce the size of the debts relative to incomes, and the debt cycle runs its course.

Phase 6: The Return to Hard Money. In this phase, the central government takes actions to restore the soundness of its money and debt/credit. This type of monetary policy occurs after the debt has been written down through debt defaults/restructurings and debt monetizations so the debt levels relative to the incomes and amounts of money that are available to service the debts can be brought back into alignment. As previously described, it comes after those who held the debt assets were burned by the defaults and/or inflationary periods, so confidence in holding debt assets has to be rebuilt. At this stage, countries typically go back to MP0 (i.e., a hard-asset-backed monetary policy) or MP1 (an interest rate/ money-supply-targeted monetary policy) that is beneficial to lender-creditors via high real interest rates.

- For great countries with great empires, the end of the Big Debt Cycle has typically meant the end of their prominence.

### A FEW CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS

Big debt crises are inevitable. Throughout history, only a very few well-disciplined countries have avoided them. They are inevitable because lending is never done perfectly relative to the incomes that are needed to service it. And it is often done badly because people always want more credit, and that turns into debt. Debt levels get beyond that which is sustainable, which leads to the need to bring the debt burdens down, which typically leads to a mixture of debt defaults/restructurings and the creating of money and credit, causing a debt crisis to occur. And people's psychology reinforces the cycle: the bubble period makes people more optimistic, causing them to borrow more, and the bust causes people to be more pessimistic, causing them to cut spending. Even though this progression has happened many times in history, most policymakers and investors think their current circumstances and monetary system won't change. The change is unthinkable—and then it happens suddenly.

It pays to build up savings in the good times so there are savings to draw on in the bad times. There are costs to having too much savings as well as too little savings, and no one gets the balance exactly right.

The best way to anticipate a debt crisis happening is not by focusing on a single influence or number like debt as a percent of GDP; it is by understanding and focusing on a number of interrelated dynamics. We will get into, especially in the next two chapters.

- If debts are denominated in a country's own currency, its central bank can and will "print" the money to alleviate the debt crisis. This allows the central bank to manage the crisis better than if the central bank can't print the money, but of course it also reduces the value of the money. If the debt is not denominated in a currency that the central bank can print, then it will have debt defaults and deflationary depressions measured in the currency that it owes and can't print.
- All debt crises, even big ones, can be managed well by economic policymakers restructuring and monetizing the debt so that the deflationary ways of reducing the debt burdens (i.e., writing off and restructuring debt) and the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (i.e., creating money and credit and giving it to the debtors to make it easier for them to service their debts) balance each other. The key is to spread the paying back over time. For example, if the debt-to-income ratio needs to fall by about  $50\%$  to make it sustainable, a debt restructuring that spreads it out at a rate of  $3\%$  or  $4\%$  per year would be much less traumatic than one that is about  $50\%$  in one year.
- Debt crises provide great risks and opportunities that have been shown to both destroy empires and provide great investment opportunities for investors if they understand how they work and have good principles for navigating them well.

If you try to focus on debt cycles precisely or focus your attention on the short term, you won't see them. It's like comparing two snowflakes and missing that they are pretty much the same because they're not exactly the same.

### That's it in a nutshell.

In the rest of this study, I will get into the mechanics in greater depth, show the actual sequences that have played out over 35 cases, look at how the Big Debt Cycle and Overall Big Cycle that includes the other big cycles (for instance, cycles of internal and external order) that started in 1945 and that we are currently in the late stages of have transpired relative to this template, and briefly look at the Chinese and Japanese Big Cycles and a number of other cases. The Japanese case is interesting because Japan is further along in its Big Debt Cycle. Notably, its large debt and debt monetizations have led to the depreciation of its currency and debt, which has led holders of its bonds to have losses of $45\%$ relative to holding US dollar debt since 2013 and losses of $60\%$ relative to holding gold since 2013. In the final chapters, I will share how I am processing the US relative to this template, how the US could reduce the risk of an acute debt crisis, and how I see the rough outline of future events unfolding.
