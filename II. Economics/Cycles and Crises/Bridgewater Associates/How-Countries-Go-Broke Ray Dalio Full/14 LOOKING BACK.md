# 14_LOOKING_BACK
## LOOKING

### BACK

As explained, watching what is now happening is like watching a movie that I have seen many times before but set in different countries at different times because all of these Big Cycles transpire in analogous ways. In the previous chapters, I described how that classic movie typically transpires. In this part of the book, I will show you the most important cases of it transpiring over the last 180 years, which covers two Big Cycles in the US, China, Japan, and the wider world. That way, in just about 100 pages, you will be able to get a comprehensive review of roughly the last two centuries, see these Big Cycles transpire, and compare them with the Big Cycle template I previously described in Parts I and II.

In Chapter 9, I will very briefly take you through the 80-year Big Cycle before 1945. Then, in the following chapters, I will show you more completely what has happened from the end of World War II until my writing of this book in March 2025. I conclude Part III with single chapters that cover the same periods and the Big Cycles for China and Japan. After you see all these cases and the Big Cycle changes to monetary, internal governance, and external governance orders, you will have seen the Big Cycle template play out repeatedly so you can join me in using that template to look at what we are now seeing happen and what may be ahead, which we will do in Part IV.

### THE PAST IS PROLOGUE

Before I begin my descriptions of history, I will pass along two principles that I think will help you if you keep them in mind:

If you want to see how and why big events have unfolded, be careful not to focus precisely on small events. People who try to see things up close and precisely typically miss the most important big things because they are preoccupied with looking for precision. So, when looking for the big things, pay attention to the big things.

- Everything that happens does so for reasons that make it happen, so we should strive to understand and explain the cause/effect relationships that drive changes and create from them a logical template/model that both explains past changes and aligns with what is actually happening, and if there are discrepancies, we should work to understand and resolve them.

What I am saying is that in the most fundamental ways, the previously described processes and cycles have happened in all countries over all of time, though none of them have been exactly the same. So, to see the processes and cycles and the template they provide us, you need to pay attention to the biggest and most important changes that have happened, keeping in mind the reasons for the big changes and the big differences.

To emphasize the importance of the big things, I describe them in a simplified way, so it's easy for some people to say, "That's not exactly right!" and be correct. I am intentionally conveying this template in a non-exact way in order to draw attention to the most important things.

As you read these descriptions of history, please remember that this timeless and universal template has been working in essentially the same way for thousands of years in all countries, driven by the same basic and logical cause/effect relationships that will be clear to you if you don't get too focused on the details.
