### IN A TINY NUTSHELL

This very brief, eight-page chapter begins a series of chapters that explain how the Big Cycle has played out in the past. It describes the 80 years from 1865 to 1945. By reading it, you will gain a great perspective on what happened and how well my template explains it. In this chapter and those that follow, you will see the classic Big Debt Cycles and the classic domestic and international cycles that changed the monetary, internal political, and international geopolitical orders, starting and ending with wars. You will see how the wars were followed by periods of great inventiveness and productivity early in the post-war periods, leading to great debt-financed speculations, big increases in wealth differences, and then bubbles and busts that created new fights over wealth and power that led to new internal and international wars, produced new winners and losers, and created new orders and the next Big Cycles.

Starting in the US, 80 years before 1945 brings us back to the end of the US Civil War. That is a good time to begin this review of what happened, given that Big Cycles typically start after a war.

### FROM 1865 TO 1918

The US Civil War was over the usual issues—i.e., who got to say what would happen related to economic, political, and social issues—e.g., slavery in this case. As is typical of such conflicts, it was very costly and financed by debt that grew too great to be paid back. The US government's debt went from $2\%$ of GDP to $40\%$ of GDP, and interest payments alone ate up over half of the budget, not including the debts of the losing Confederate states, which defaulted after the war. At the start of the war, the dollar was linked to gold at a price of \$20.67 per ounce. During the war, the US government defaulted on its promise to pay its debts by not letting holders of dollars turn them in for gold. It printed paper money that wasn't backed by gold (called greenbacks), so the value of money plunged, the value of gold in this new printed currency soared to roughly \$250 per ounce, and the inflation rate in this new currency rose to $80\%$ in 1865.

A timeless and universal principle to keep in mind is:

During times when there is too much debt relative to the quantity of money that is needed to service debts, the need to either increase the amount of money that exists and/or cut the amount of debt there is leads governments to break their promises and do some combination of a) raising the amount of money and credit, b) reducing the amount of debt (e.g., by restructuring it), and/or c) preventing the free-market ownership and movement of the hard money (e.g., gold). At such times, there is a run away from bad money to good money that the government wants to stop. This often leads to prohibiting good money from being freely held and freely moved.

That devaluation of money, defaults, and monetary stimulations reduced the debt burdens relative to incomes, and when the Civil War ended, it was followed by a period of great productivity and leveraging up that created the next bubble and bust, which I will soon describe.

It was all classic.

From 1870 to 1914, with the war over and debt burdens reduced, the Second Industrial Revolution productivity miracle began.

Classically, debtand equity-financed great technological investment booms led to great economic advances, big wealth and values gaps, and then bubbles and busts that led to great internal conflicts. At the same time, similar conditions around the world led to newly powerful countries challenging both the established powers and the established world order, which eventually led to war.

The technological advances that accompanied this great productivity boom were in railroads that opened up and linked the Western and Eastern US; steel production that was used to build bridges, skyscrapers, and railroads; electricity (e.g., Thomas Edison's invention of the light bulb and revolutionary improvements in electricity distribution); Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone; oil production that fueled these advances; and the invention and broad distribution of the automobile. As always, big wealth gaps appeared as the great new inventions that were turned into great new products made those who came up with them and commercialized them very rich. The rich were increasingly resented (they were then called "robber barons") for their business tactics and their lavishness (this era was called the Gilded Age), which led to classic left/right class conflicts developing in the early 20th century.

During this time, there was no central bank, and the dollar was fixed to gold by commercial banks. As a result, when there were debt busts, there was no printing of money to ease them, so some of the busts were very big and long-lasting. For example, a big debt bust led to the Panic of 1873, which marked the start of the Long Depression and several national and regional panics that lasted until 1896. There were similar debt-bust panics in 1893 and 1907. Sticking to the gold standard became a major political issue that led presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan to famously declare, "You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." Eventually, the severity of these booms and busts, especially the Panic of 1907, prompted the government to create the Federal Reserve central banking system in 1913 in order to better manage monetary policy for dealing with these boom/bust cycles.

In the 1900 to 1914 period, all the classic late Big Cycle symptoms emerged. There was overindebtedness and internal political conflicts between rich business elites/capitalists of the right and the low-earning workers and socialist/anarchists on the left. Capitalism versus Marxism was the economic/ideological conflict in both the US and Europe, and many extremist followers on both sides were willing to fight to the death rather than compromise.

In the US, there was a move toward the left with progressive Theodore Roosevelt becoming president after President William McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist. Anarchists assassinated several world leaders around this time. In Europe, the rising power of Germany and its allies challenged the more established power of the UK and its allies (most importantly, France). In Asia, Japan went to war with and defeated Russia, making Japan the leading imperial power in the region. The world was much less connected in this era, and foreign countries seemed much farther away, so what happened in one's own region was much more important than what happened on the other side of the world. But by the early 20th century, the world was starting to come closer together, and the United States increasingly became a world power.

Then in 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand from Austria-Hungary was assassinated, and World War I began.

I won't go into the blow-by-blow of it, but I will say that it led to the world order changing in the classic big and important ways previously described, including the emergence of the United States as the world's richest and largest creditor nation. The US became the world's leading financial power because it played a big role in financing the war and manufacturing and selling things for the war, and it didn't have major spending or war destruction costs because it entered the war late. While the US profited from the war, the other winners—the UK and France—were weakened and indebted by it, and the war's losers were devastated by it. Germany became terribly indebted, and both Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire were completely destroyed and broken up. Germany was in debt both to those who lent it money to finance the war (which it immediately defaulted on) and to the winners of the war through the imposition of reparations. Germany's economy was burdened by these obligations until Hitler defaulted on them in 1933.

In Russia, the World War I period brought conflict between the rich monarchy (who wanted to keep its wealth and privileges) and the poor masses (who were angry and wanted more). This led to civil war and the dramatic change in the domestic order to become Marxist-communist. Russia then created the Soviet Union in 1922 by taking over Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Central Asia. Japan, which had allied itself with the winners of the war, became the leading power in Asia.

### At the end of the war in 1918, a big pandemic happened.

After all that, the winners got together to determine what the new world order would look like. In this case, it was clear that the world was becoming more interconnected due to advances in transportation and communications. World War I was the first truly global versus regional war, so naturally the question of how world governance should work arose for the first time. As described in the last chapter, President Wilson aspired to create an orderly world that would in some ways replicate a US style of representative governance. That led to the formation of the League of Nations, which failed at preventing the next major war. We still haven't figured out how world governance could advance beyond fighting to determine who gets what they want.

### FROM 1918 TO 1945

Then, from 1918 until around 1930, in the West, there was another classic period of peace, great inventiveness, and productivity due to entrepreneurs coming up with great new products that were financed by debt and equity investments/speculations that produced big increases in wealth differences and bubbles.

More specifically, the 1920s became known as the Roaring '20s because of the rapid economic growth and technological innovations that, early on, produced great productivity and productive lending in which incomes were more than large enough to fuel advances and provide good returns. The great inventions that were converted into mass production and greatly advanced the world included automobiles, airplanes, radios, televisions, talking movies, refrigerators, drugs and medications, and many other items. As always, what started as productive lending and investment grew into a big bubble. When it burst in 1929 with debt defaults and a stock market crash, it was followed by a depression. When the crash happened, the debt/money/economic force greatly impacted the domestic political and international geopolitical forces and changed the monetary, political, and geopolitical orders.

Seeing this debt/stock market/economic bust, what principle should jump to mind? The same one I mentioned a few pages ago:

During times when there is too much debt relative to the quantity of money that is needed to service debts, the need to either increase the amount of money that exists and/or cut the amount of debt there is leads governments to break their promises and do some combination of a) raising the amount of money and credit, b) reducing the amount of debt (e.g., by restructuring it), and/or c) preventing the free-market ownership and movement of the hard money (e.g., gold). At such times, there is a run away from bad money to good money that the government wants to stop. This often leads to prohibiting good money from being freely held and freely moved.

Through a series of actions, President Franklin D. Roosevelt outlawed the private ownership of gold, defaulted on the promise to allow holders of paper money to turn it in for gold, and changed the official exchange rate of \$1 for 1/20.67th of an ounce of gold to \$1 for 1/35th of an ounce—devaluing money by about 40\%. He also imposed strict foreign exchange controls that prevented Americans from taking their money abroad and restricted Americans' abilities to have foreign bank accounts.

This wasn't the only significant change in monetary policy or radical approach to a debt issue that occurred during the period covered in this chapter. Many more countries went broke (i.e., defaulted on or significantly devalued their debts in the ways I've reviewed) between 1865 and 1945 than I can describe here, but I can give you a partial list:

- The US leaving the gold standard during and devaluing money after the Civil War
Several countries, in addition to the US, leaving the gold standard and devaluing money in the Great Depression
Weimar Germany restructuring its Treaty of Versailles debts
China and Russia repudiating past debts
- China abandoning the silver standard in favor of paper currency in 1935
- Greece debasing its coinage, causing it to be expelled from an early European currency union (1908)

As is classic, in the 1930s there were those of the hard right (fascists) and those of the hard left (communists) who fought in their own ways for control within their countries. In the 1920s and 1930s, several inefficiently run, conflict-ridden representative governments (Spain, Italy, Japan, and Germany) turned to demagogic leaders and autocracies of the right (fascism) to bring order to the chaos. Just as we are now seeing in the US and several other countries, this turn toward more rightist governments led to a squaring-off against leftists, and there was a marked move away from attempts at multilateralism, a breaking of agreements, and the rise of strongman unilateralism. For example, Hitler broke out of the Treaty of Versailles by choosing to default on the debt that Germany had agreed to pay. Germany and Japan both became more nationalistic and expansionistic, seizing territories in Europe, Africa, and Asia (more detail on Japan during this time can be found in Chapter 16). These ascending powers largely rose at the expense of the prior leading world powers—the UK, France, and the Netherlands—that had all become overextended and unable to defend their colonies around the world. As a principle,

- When countries are weak, opposing countries take advantage of their weaknesses to obtain gains. All these dynamics set the stage for increased conflict between nations, eventually leading to World War II, after which there was the beginning of the next world order, which is the one we are now in the late stages of.

As previously explained and covered much more completely in Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order and elsewhere in my writings, in the period leading up to World War II, nations around the world employed all the classic maneuvers and developments that precede military wars. These include economic warfare, freezing of financial assets, and military buildups. Once the war began (with Germany's attack on Poland in 1939 and Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941), all the usual war developments unfolded, such as using conventional weapons and the secret development and then usage of powerful new weapons that won the war. Then the unconditional surrenders of the losers led to meetings of the winners and new monetary, internal political, and external geopolitical orders. The spoils of war went to the winning Allies and the penalties of losing were handed out to the Axis powers as laid out in the Treaty of Versailles. As always, these decisions reshaped the world order and had implications for decades to come.

We will next look in greater detail at what happened after the end of World War II until my writing of this book in March 2025. While I will frame the evolution of the cycle in the context of the Big Debt Cycle, showing how the Big Debt Cycle went through its various monetary regimes, I will also show how it combined with the other four forces to shape the Overall Big Cycle.
