# 16.10 A Brief Review of the Big Debt Cycle from 1945
## A BRIEF REVIEW OF

### THE BIG DEBT CYCLE

### FROM 1945 TO NOW

This chapter is a very brief overview of the Big Debt Cycle that began in 1945. In it, I explain how the cycle has transpired as a function of the earlier-described template based on mechanical cause/effect relationships. If you are interested in the relationships that drive the markets and the economy and how they have moved in the post-1945 period, this chapter will probably interest you. If you're not interested in such things, you may want to skip it and move on to Chapters 11-14, in which I walk through the monetary policy phases of our current Big Debt Cycle.

Because I was born in 1949 and have been a global macro investor for most of my life, I have both experienced and studied most of what I am going to describe, so I am going to share some personal descriptions to help enrich the picture and pass along some lessons that I learned from going through these experiences, especially through my painful mistakes, which stick in my mind much more than my winning decisions. As you watch the story of the last 80 years unfold, observe the almost in-unison swings in the five forces from one extreme to the other. Note that they were so extreme that each decade was more likely to be more opposite than similar to the decade before it, yet at the end of each, markets and investor psychology expected more of the same, so those were the key times to understand the fundamentals well and bet against the crowd on the unexpected developments that were logically probable.

Let's now look at what has happened since the end of World War II when the new world order began. While I will be putting what happened in the context of the Big Debt Cycle, you will see that the other four forces also swung greatly and interacted with the debt cycles to shape what happened. You will see all five forces flow like waves, sometimes small ones and sometimes big ones, sometimes reinforcing each other and sometimes negating each other, and sometimes with big ones coming together to create perfect storms. As for the debt cycle force, to repeat, the main thing to keep in mind is:

- Normally, when central banks want to be stimulative, they lower interest rates and/or create a lot more money and credit, which creates a lot more spending and debt. This stimulation both extends the expansion phase of the cycle and raises debt assets and liabilities relative to incomes, which makes the debt asset and debt liability balance more precarious. History shows us that when central banks can't lower interest rates anymore and want to be stimulative, they print money and buy debt, especially government debt. That gives debtors, most importantly governments, money and credit to prevent them from defaulting and allows them to continue to borrow in order to spend more than they are earning until the debt assets and liabilities become too great to balance, which is when a debt restructuring and/or debt monetization must occur.

### THE CURRENT BIG DEBT CYCLE IN BRIEF

Before I get into what happened, I'd like to show you the Big Debt Cycle in a few charts, starting in 1900 with the United States. Showing the whole period from then to the present will give you a greater perspective. I have focused on the US dollar debt charts because the world money/debt market has been a US dollar debt market during this Big Cycle, even though it is the case that other countries have also had their own Big Cycles.

In the US, between 1945 and 2024, there have been 12 complete short-term debt cycles, and we are about two-thirds through the 13th. They averaged about six years in length and added up to one Big Debt Cycle that brought the central government's debt-to-income ratio up and worsened the central bank's balance sheet in the ways shown in the charts that follow. Said differently, the US and its credit markets have been in the leveraging-up phase of the long-term debt cycle, and they haven't yet entered the deleveraging part of the long-term debt cycle, though there have been some brief deleveragings along the way. These charts show the big picture. Most people overlook this big-picture arc because they are focused on the short-term wiggles, which don't even show up in these charts.

This first chart shows US private debt relative to GDP since 1900. The current Big Debt Cycle beginning in 1945 is obvious. Note the peak in private debt (as a percent of GDP) in 2008 and the slight decline since then. The decline happened as the US central government and US central bank stepped in in a big way to help the private sector, which is shown in the next two charts. As previously explained, this is typical of the beginning of the Big Cycle's late stage.

The next chart shows US government debt relative to GDP, with the dots signifying projections by the CBO in 10 and 20 years. As shown, it is evolving in a Big Cycle way, is now at the highest level since 1946 (around the end of World War II), and is projected to be much higher in the future.

USA CENTRAL GOVT DEBT LEVEL (\% GDP)

Now I will combine the last two charts into one chart so you can see how they relate to each other. You can see how private and public sector debt levels have been related: most importantly, how the government has tended to acquire more debt when the private sector is acquiring less. For example, you can see how the government's debt as a share of GDP has increased dramatically since 2008, while the private sector's debt-to-GDP has gone down. That is because in order to provide the private sector with more support, the central government has gone deeper into debt.

USA DEBT LEVEL (\% GDP)

The next chart shows central government debt service as a percentage of government revenue. As shown, it is now at about  $100\%$  and it is projected to rise to about  $150\%$  in 15 years. To visualize what that means, imagine that the amount of money you had to pay in debt service each year was  $50\%$  greater than what you earned each year. It's unthinkable. So, what would one have to believe to think this would work? One would need to believe that the government will be able to 1) roll over the debt that is coming due, 2) sell the new debt that it needs to borrow to fund the deficit, and 3) have holders of the existing debt not sell it (i.e., that those who are lending to the government decide that they want to continue lending to the government because it's not too risky).

USA CENTRAL GOVT DEBT SERVICE (\% REVENUE)

Because everything that happens does so because of reasons that make it happen, if one looks at and thinks about them, one can see indicators of the cause/effect relationships, watch them unfolding, and use them as indicators of what is likely to happen. To help paint the picture, I will pass along a few more of these indicators.

The next chart shows the 10-year Treasury bond rate and a three-year moving average of the inflation rate. The relationship between interest rates and the inflation rate is important because when interest rates are high relative to the inflation rate, there is an incentive to save and earn the interest rate, and when interest rates are low relative to the inflation rate, there is an incentive to borrow and hold assets that

### benefit from inflation and the growth that low interest rates foster.

The bond yield consists of two parts—the expected inflation rate and the expected real bond yield. Both are important in affecting the value of money and debt as a store of wealth and as a cost of funds. Note that on the upswing of this Big Cycle, all short-term cyclical swings in bond yields (i.e., those that took place in the cycles of recessions, stimulations, strong growth, and rising inflation periods that led to tightening money and credit that then led to recessions and falling bond yields) and all the cyclical declines in bond yields were higher than the ones before them until 1981. Also note that each of the short-term cyclical swings in bond yields from 1981 until 2020 was lower than the ones before until nominal interest rates nearly hit $0\%$ and real interest rates were significantly negative. That reflects the big cycle in inflation expectations and the real interest rates' movements around these expectations. While nominal interest rates are important, real interest rates are even more important because they are an indicator of the attractiveness of Treasury bonds as a store of wealth.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/3547bc27-1262-4e8f-ad60-d760e9f0a79a/6d726d187646ad66effd9d0845d488a8f1dcb24a259221152b7bae666c487101.jpg)

In the next chart, you can see the real 10-year bond yield. In the years after 1997, I am using the real yield on a 10-year Treasury inflation-protected bond. In my opinion, the real bond yield is the most important number to watch in the financial world. That is because it shows what real return you can certainly get on your wealth (i.e., free of inflation risk and default risk),[28] which is the most foundational rate for all capital markets. To earn more than that rate, one has to do so through cleverness. Even more importantly, it is the single best indicator of whether it is better to be a borrower-debtor or a lender-creditor—e.g., when real interest rates are low, it is much easier to borrow money and convert it into profits than when real interest rates are high. As such, it is a great tool for central banks to use to modulate credit and economic activity. As shown, the real bond yield has averaged about $2\%$ over the last 100 years, which is a rate that is neither too low for borrower-debtors nor too high for lender-creditors. Periods of great differences from this $2\%$ were times of excessively cheap or excessively expensive credit/debt that contributed greatly to the big swings in the Big Debt Cycle.

USA REAL YIELD

When looking at nominal bond yields relative to inflation-indexed bonds' real yields, I can also see the breakeven inflation rate, which is the inflation rate that the market is betting on. Since one can make money betting against that rate if one thinks inflation will be higher or lower than the market believes, and the markets are pretty tough to beat, one can use that inflation rate as a naïve but pretty good estimate.

If one doesn't have a market-beating way to make a better estimate. Because I can see in the market pricing both the "discounted" (i.e., market-expected) inflation rate and the discounted real interest rate that I can lock in, I see the bond yield and price as consisting of these two important drivers. I am always watching them rather than just the Treasury bond interest rate, and I often think of and trade the two pieces—i.e., the inflation rate and the real interest rate—separately. Their historical estimated pricing is shown in the next chart.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/3547bc27-1262-4e8f-ad60-d760e9f0a79a/dd3ffc79d571613be2fc4c4640a09cb6c670b573ab42fe8553ff50b95d7e6dd3.jpg)

USA ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL RATES

I always think about the 10-year interest rate and its two parts because it is the most important governor of all capital markets. I have been intimately involved with it for a long time. For several years, when there wasn't an inflation-indexed bond market in the US, I invested in non-US inflation-indexed bonds that I currency-hedged to create a synthetic equivalent of a US inflation-indexed bond. That came about because a great investor, David White of the Rockefeller Foundation, explained that he had to give away  5\%  a year and asked me what I thought was the surest way of investing to fund that, which prompted me to think about leveraging and hedging non-US inflation-indexed bonds. That led Bridgewater to become the largest global inflation-indexed bond manager in the world, and I was invited to work on the design of the Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) market with Larry Summers when he ran the US Treasury. Since then, we have had a real market showing real bond yields both to look at for guidance and to invest in, which has been foundational to all my investment thinking. I believe that the inflation-indexed bond markets that exist around the world are much underappreciated and underused relative to their potential. I watch them as indicators and use them as storehouses of wealth.

The relationship between short-term rates and long-term rates (i.e., the yield curve) is very important because when short-term interest rates are high relative to long-term rates, that indicates money is tight and encourages the holding and lending of cash, which becomes more attractive than borrowing and investing in other assets. Movements in the attractiveness of different assets affect the nominal interest rate yield curve—i.e., the difference between the 10-year nominal bond yield and the nominal short rate[31]—reflecting the changing tightness of money and the changing incentives to hold cash relative to bonds.[32] That is because a higher interest rate is normally required by lender-creditors to hold longer-term debt and because long-term interest rates higher than cash rates provide a reward/inducement for lending. When the central bank wants to slow credit growth and economic demand, it raises short-term rates relative to long-term rates, and when it wants to stimulate, it does the opposite. When both 1) real yields are high and 2) the yield curve is nearly flat or inverted, money and credit are tight, which is typically a good environment for lender-creditors and a bad environment for borrower-debtors, and when 3) real yields are low and 4) the yield curve is relatively positive, that is typically a good environment for borrower-debtors and a bad environment for lender-creditors. When central banks shift these things extremely, that leads to extremely good or extremely bad envi ronments and a lot of volatility for both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors, which is also disruptive to economies and causes pain and inefficiencies.

I think the Fed should not be as extreme and volatile as it has been in its use of interest rates to influence monetary policy. If I were running monetary policy, my goal would be to keep the long-term real interest rate relatively stable at a rate that balances the needs of both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors and doesn't contribute to the making of debt bubbles and busts. That would mean seeking to have the real Treasury bond yield around  $2\%$ , varying that target by something like  $1\%$ , and targeting the yield curve slope so that a) the short-term rate is about  $1\%$  below the long-term rate and b) the short-term rate divided by the long-term rate is about  $70\%$ , give or take about  $2\%$  and about  $50\%$ , respectively.

YIELD CURVE

Setting policy in a way that produces fewer big and volatile swings in real interest rates and yield curves would lead to less volatility. In turn, that would lead to less harm to borrower-debtors and lender-creditors (and everything else they affect in the economy), and it would allow them to plan better. In other words, with a more consistent policy, borrower-debtors and lender-creditors would know that they could expect a reasonable real rate, which should be acceptable to both of them so they could plan their activities accordingly. With that relatively certain borrowing rate, lending and economic conditions would adapt to that reasonable interest rate. Also, setting that rate would help provide both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors more stable cost of funds and real returns, which would make for more stable capital markets and yield more stable economic conditions, which would improve efficiencies that would enhance the running of capital markets and the economy. But let's get back to exploring rates and how they impact the economy.

Thus far, I have just shown you the big picture of the Treasury interest rate, but that isn't the rate that people, companies, and local governments borrow at. For that reason, watching credit spreads is helpful. Next is a chart that shows an average credit spread (for Baa corporate bonds) since 1920.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/3547bc27-1262-4e8f-ad60-d760e9f0a79a/94992808835b3c71614ddf1eba86a409603aaa8faeb7e14d8914c9cef968b923.jpg)

The amount of interest owed on a debt is determined by the amount borrowed and the interest rate, which, together with the amount of principal to be paid back, is the amount of debt service.

Let's revisit the chart shared earlier that shows total debt service (principal payments plus interest payments) for the US central government relative to its revenues and how much of that comes from principal payments and how much comes from interest payments. Note that debt service was roughly flat from 1950 to 2000; that is because government debt levels were roughly flat or falling slightly relative to revenue over that period, so principal payments were also roughly flat to slightly falling. Interest payments rose slightly from

1950 to 1990, as the average interest rate on government debt slowly rose, then fell from 1990 to roughly 2022, as the average interest rate on government debt slowly fell.

I am using dots to show how this is projected to grow, based on the CBO's estimates, for the next 10 and 20 years. The projected picture is very different from the recent past because the central government's debt levels are high and projected to rise fast, and the interest rate on these high debts is also projected to rise, which will cause a big increase in government debt service relative to government revenue, which will produce a significant squeeze on spending unless there is a lot more borrowing, most likely financed by the central bank. Therein lies the problem.

USA CENTRAL GOVT DEBT SERVICE (\% REVENUE)

Who did the central government borrow the money from? It borrowed a lot of it from the central bank. It also borrowed a lot from commercial banks and, for about a third of it, from foreign investors. These commercial and foreign buyers/holders of US debt have had losses in it as interest rates have risen, they have more US debt as a percentage of their holdings than makes sense on a financial basis alone, and some of them are worried that the US government won't pay them the way it didn't pay Japan in the years before World War II.

So they have become sellers. In the case of the biggest foreign holders of US government bonds, they acquired so much because they wanted to store buying power in the most widely used and accepted currency of the greatest and most credible world power—said differently, because the dollar is the leading reserve currency of the leading world power. Looking ahead, given the increased supply of US government dollar debt that is coming (as shown in the last chart) relative to the desired demand for it, it is hard to imagine that these big buyers/holders are likely in the future to buy the huge amounts of US Treasuries that they did in the past, especially if any of the key underpinnings of that demand weaken—e.g., a) if the US government irresponsibly handles its debt and its domestic and foreign policy issues, b) if the US government threatens to sanction them by withholding payments on the debt, c) if the returns from holding the debt are bad, and/or d) if the US loses its economic and geopolitical prominence.

From 1980 until 2008, lowering interest rates was more than enough to keep debt service affordable even as debt levels kept rising. But when rates nearly hit zero in 2008, as they did in the post-1933 period, private market demand for the bonds was inadequate to meet the supply, so the central bank stepped in to print money and buy the bonds, which put downward pressure on longer-term rates. It happened in two major waves—one in response to the 1929-33 debt-crisis-induced Great Depression when interest rates hit $0\%$ in the post-1933 period, and again in response to the 2008 debt-crisis-induced Great Recession when interest rates hit $0\%$. (You can see this in the following chart where the small circles indicate the beginning of money printing and interest rates hitting zero.) I wouldn't have known that, and Bridgewater wouldn't have been successful in this period, if we hadn't studied the time frame shown in this chart. This is also what led to my first discovery of how the Big Debt Cycle works.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/3547bc27-1262-4e8f-ad60-d760e9f0a79a/aa38e919397e814fff729cc5ee9d39bdc4123beeb0d91f090a31fb3cf24f4008.jpg)

As for the central bank, the Federal Reserve and other central banks' debt assets provide lower returns than the costs required to service their liabilities, so the modest rise in the interest rate that has occurred in this most recent tightening has caused the Fed to take modest operating losses (blue line in the next chart). If the bonds on the Fed balance sheet were marked to market, the Fed's losses would be around \$700 billion, or \$2.5\% of GDP (red line). This sounds significant but it is relatively minor compared to the central bank's capacity to obtain funding. However, it is a red flag and would become a major problem if there was a big selling of US debt, which is what typically happens when that debt is perceived to be a risky asset. As previously explained, for countries like the United States that have the ability to print their own money, that would lead to either a) a big and intolerable rise in nominal and real interest rates, which would contract credit and lead to a severe economic contraction, or b) a big central bank printing of money and buying of debt and providing of credit, which would lead to the devaluation of debt and money. The big central bank losses and bad conditions would also increase the likelihood that the central bank's independence would be called into question. For those countries that have debt denominated in a reserve currency that is not their own, conditions would be much worse.

### DEBT BURDENS WILL INCREASE GLOBALLY

In this overview chapter, I have focused on the debt picture for the US. You can see in the charts that follow that this is not only a US issue. Debt burdens are projected to grow substantially across the developed world over the coming decades. It is crucial to understand how these dynamics will play out in order to understand how to make policy and how to trade in markets in the years ahead.

In the rest of Part III, I am going to take you through the complete Big Debt Cycle for the US since 1945 because the US dollar was and still is the dominant reserve currency that most transactions were and still are denominated in and most savings are in, before diving into China's and Japan's Big Debt Cycles in Chapters 15 and 16. To me, the US over the last 80 years, Japan after its bubble bursting, and the other cases I have looked at are all classic Big Debt Cycles that are operating in the previously described ways that are important for investors and policymakers in all countries to understand. This is especially true now that some of them are encountering the late stages of Big Debt Cycles in their own countries and they will likely experience serious consequences from their own Big Debt Cycles, as well as the US's Big Debt Cycle and its implications for US dollar assets and liabilities.

We will now look at what has happened through the phases of the long-term debt cycle. To make clear how events have transpired relative to the previously explained debt/credit template, I will divide the post-1945 period into four phases signifying the four main monetary regimes that have driven the debt/credit dynamic since 1945. We will begin in 1945 because that is when the new monetary, geopolitical, and, in many cases, domestic political orders began.
