## 1971 TO 2008—

### A FIAT MONEY, INTEREST-RATE-DRIVEN MONETARY POLICY

The August 1971 breakdown of the monetary system changed the value of money and how the system worked—i.e., the gold-linked system was replaced by a fiat monetary system in which central banks stimulated and restrained debt/credit/ money growth by changing interest rates. I call this type of monetary system (i.e., one in which fiat currencies are managed via interest rate changes) Monetary Policy 1 (MP1). I make these distinctions between types of monetary policy because they work very differently, and it is important to understand these differences. The most important differences between MP0 and MP1 are that in an MP1 monetary system a) the amount of money and credit provided by lender-creditors to borrower-debtors is primarily driven by the cost of money (i.e., interest rates) and b) it is not restrained by the link to hard currency (e.g., to gold). Because the amount of money and credit was unrestrained and because the world's central banker (the Fed) wanted to accommodate what happened, this change in policy led to a very classic combination of economic stagnation and inflation, which was called stagflation.

### FROM 1971 TO 1982: STAGFLATION AND TIGHTENING AND THE MOVE FROM THE POLITICAL LEFT TO THE POLITICAL RIGHT

The decade from 1971 to 1982 provides a good example of how cycles in the five big forces interrelate to create the Overall Big Cycle. In this period, the Big Debt Cycle was influenced by, and helped drive, big cycles in politics and global conflict.

We'll start by looking at the debt/money/economic cycle. When President Nixon ended the MP0 monetary system and transitioned to the MP1 system, the central bank and the central government took advantage of having fewer constraints and printed money. From 1971 until the end of 1981, the Federal Reserve increased the supply of money by  \$100\% , and the broader measures of money supply that included some bank accounts and cash instruments (called M2) increased by  \$180\% . The prices of goods and services (measured in CPI) went up by about  \$140\% ; stocks went up by around  \$30\% , and the price of gold increased about  \$10x . Stock prices fell by  \$45\%  in real terms. Of course, debtors benefited because they could pay their debts with much more available and much cheaper dollars, and creditors suffered because the value of the money they were promised dwindled. In that 10-year period, a holder of 10-year Treasury bonds lost around  40\%  in inflation-adjusted terms, and holders of Baa corporate bonds had slightly negative returns in inflation-adjusted terms. In other words, starting in 1971 and through the next few years, the Fed dealt with the debt crisis by creating a lot more money and credit, which created great debt relief for debtors and great losses of buying power for creditors, which encouraged borrowing and discouraged lending. This decade of debt monetization developments made a big impression on me and taught me some invaluable lessons about the need and ability to make money in all kinds of markets. I think that current investors who have only lived in an environment in which equity-like assets have had positive real returns approach investing by only looking to buy equity-like investments to provide great real returns, and that is a mistake.

The most important difference between today's dollars and dollars in the 1945-71 period is that today's money is and has been fiat money since 1971. That means that the Fed (which is essentially the world's central banker because the US dollar is the world's dominant medium of exchange and store of wealth) can more freely create money and credit than in the past. Other central banks can do the same, so this affects all mediums of exchange and stores of wealth. For previously explained reasons, doing that is the easiest and simplest way for governments to alleviate debt burdens and confiscate wealth. By the way, fiat monetary systems have existed throughout history, so studying those from the past provides invaluable lessons on how they work that can provide clues for how the one we are in will go as the debt cycle progresses.

While the gold-dollar-based system broke down in 1971, the US remained the dominant world power economically, militarily, and in most other respects, and most world trade and capital transactions were done in dollars, so the dollar remained the world's leading currency that governments, companies, and people wanted to save in, despite the fact that it was such a terrible store of wealth in the 1970s.

In the 1971-82 period, it paid to be a borrower-debtor because the big devaluation that started in August 1971 had immediate inflationary effects. At the same time, geopolitical conflicts played a role in shaping the environment.

More specifically, the big easing of monetary policy in 1971 after the de-linking from gold got inflation going. Simultaneously, in 1973, the British Empire and colonialism were breaking down, so there was a big geopolitical shift in the Middle East. With more money chasing limited supply—in this case, of oil—Middle Eastern countries took advantage to create the first "oil shock" that caused

More inflation. It was mostly a fight about money, as it normally is. More specifically, at that time, the colonized countries of the Middle East (and elsewhere) were overthrowing the colonialists that controlled them and nationalizing the colonialist claims on the assets of the colonized. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and Libya nationalized most of the oil properties that were owned by the "Seven Sisters" (the seven major oil companies), and in October 1973, war broke out between the Arabs and Israelis. These events led to oil prices rising a lot.

The debt/credit/money/economic cycle played out differently for different countries depending on whether they benefited or suffered from this change in prices. Commodity producers, especially in emerging countries, boomed and experienced debt-financed bubbles while the US created more money and credit to finance its debts.

Naturally, dollars from Europe, the US, and elsewhere began to be lent to commodity-producing emerging economies, creating their debt bubbles. In the early 1970s, a lot of dollars were held in other countries, especially in European countries, so there was the growth of what was called the Eurodollar market. Those dollars had to be lent out. Because there was high inflation in the world due to the previously described currency devaluations, commodity prices were high, so it seemed good to lend to commodity-producing emerging countries. That fueled a boom that created a bubble in those countries, with the lender-creditors to them being US, European, and some Japanese banks. All this investment into commodity extraction eventually contributed to price declines, especially when money became tight in the 1980s.

Early in this period, in 1971-74, money was easy, inflation and economic activity rose, and the oil-exporting countries embargoed oil, which sent oil prices and inflation higher. So, from the end of 1973 to 1974, the Fed tightened money and credit, raising interest rates and inverting the yield curve, which sent the markets and the economy into severe declines. That led to a recession. That completed that short-term debt cycle, and as always, a new cycle began.

This next cycle played out in the same way. The easy money and credit that followed the recession caused economic activity and inflation to pick up, and there was a second oil price shock that was caused by internal political and international geopolitical conflicts. In Iran, the shah's domestic order was overthrown, which led to the US embassy being seized and American hostages being held by those who took power. That began the conflict with Iran that remains with us. This development was both inflationary and humiliating for the United States. The following chart shows the average interest rate (the average of the 90-day Treasury bill rate and the 10-year Treasury bond rate) and the CPI inflation rate from 1971 through 1981. As you can see, in the 1970s interest rates rose more slowly than inflation rates, so real interest rates were low until they were negative (as low as $-4\%$ at certain points, compared to the average up to that point of $2\%$). These artificially low interest rates relative to inflation rates were great for borrower-debtors and terrible for lender-creditors, which encouraged borrowing and buying, which drove inflation rates up and interest rates followed, until inflation became so bad that changes had to be made, which led to the reverse. You can clearly see the two short-term debt cycles reflected in this chart. The vertical lines in these charts represent January 1980.

MEASURES OF REAL INTEREST RATES

At the same time, workers and labor unions had become stronger, which raised wage inflation and squeezed company profits. As shown in the next chart, labor's share of revenue increased from $68\%$ in 1965 to the US historical high of $74\%$ in 1980. That both reflected and influenced the political cycle that accompanied the debt cycle.

LABOR SHARE OF PRIVATE EARNINGS

Enough was enough. The combination of high inflation, a weak dollar, bad economic conditions, bad conditions for businesses, and geopolitical crises was intolerable for voters.

The debt/money/economic, domestic-political, and international-geopolitical pendulums/orders had swung to their extremes, so

Big changes were made, and conditions were reversed. Pretty much everything moved in the opposite direction. More specifically, in reaction to the uncontrolled inflation, in 1979, Paul Volcker was appointed chair of the Federal Reserve to shift monetary policy from very easy to the tightest money and the highest level of interest rates "since the birth of Jesus Christ" (according to German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt), and in reaction to the generally terrible conditions that occurred under left-leaning governments, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl, and other right-leaning leaders gained control. In other words, there was one of those classic roughly synchronized debt/economic and political swings that typically occurs because the people's discontentment with their conditions causes discontentment with the country's leaders and the party in power.

The following chart shows the CPI inflation rate (as a simple proxy for inflation), the average of the three-month and the 10-year interest rate (as a simple proxy for interest rates), and the yield curve (the three-month rate minus the 10-year rate—as a simple proxy for the tightness of monetary policy). From this chart, you can see the two short-term credit cycles in the 1970s, and you can see the next one emerging in the early 1980s. You can see that money was made very tight to fight inflation around 1980.

USA INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION

In addition to the monetary tightening, high real rates, and falling inflation, there was a shift from liberal to conservative labor policies. Thatcher in the UK, Reagan in the US, and Kohl in Germany (all moderate conservatives) led strong fights against labor inflation and labor unions that cut labor's share of the revenue pie, which reduced inflation and raised corporate profits. These conservative leaders also cut taxes on income and corporate profits and pursued tougher geopolitical policies.

The new Iranian leadership released the hostages exactly as Reagan took office in response to his threat of severe consequences if they didn't. Thatcher went to war with Argentina and won; the war was over Argentina's attempt to take the Falkland Islands, a group of small, nothing-special, British-controlled colonial islands. And Reagan accelerated the Cold War with the Soviet Union, which eventually ended the Soviet Union.

The strong moves by the American central government and central bank changed the flow of money and power and the direction of most everything. The markets respected strength and loved the combination of falling interest rates, falling inflation rates, high real interest rates, improving profit margins, and falling tax rates. It was a capitalist's delight. I remember the changes in policies and the changes in mood very well, especially the willingness of these leaders to have the fights to do the difficult things, even when doing these difficult things was painful.

As a result of all of these things, the 1980s were more opposite from than similar to the 1970s—i.e., it was a decade of disinflationary growth, strong stock and bond prices in developed countries, and debt bubbles popping, leading to classic inflationary depressions in emerging countries.

Throughout this period, I was deeply involved with these markets and the circumstances that drove them, which gave me the perspective that allowed me to identify great investment opportunities and to describe the mechanics of the process. But that's not to say that I fully understood all the mechanics behind these big moves from the start. In 1982, I was dead wrong because I expected the big debt crisis to cause big debt problems for American banks, the stock market, and the American and world economies. I was wrong because I failed to anticipate how forceful the change in global financial flows away from emerging markets and into American markets would be and how well the Federal Reserve and the regulators would protect the American banks. That failure provided me with great but painful lessons about the need to watch capital flows and how to do it, about how to diversify to reduce my risks without reducing my returns, and about how to be humble. That painful experience, like many others, turned out to be great because it educated me, which radically improved my and Bridgewater's performance over the next 30-plus years.

As you can see, all these big movements in markets and economies that had big effects on politics, geopolitics, and technology development were driven by debt/money/capital flows. For that reason, I decided to become an expert on capital flows.

The decade from 1971-72 to 1981-82 was a very painful and very classic decade of debt restructurings and debt monetizations that played out following the archetypal template previously described. As is quite typical, the decade that followed it was more opposite from than similar to the decade that came before it.

### FROM 1982 TO 1990: FALLING INFLATION, STRONG GROWTH, AND LEVERING UP; FROM ONE DEBT CRISIS TO ANOTHER; STILL OPERATING WITH AN MP1 MONETARY SYSTEM

The 1979-82 monetary policy changes shifted the environment from benefiting borrower-debtors, as it had in the early 1970s, to benefiting lender-creditors, as it did in the 1980s. As shown in the following charts, it lowered the inflation rate, which lowered nominal interest rates while keeping real interest rates relatively high in the 1980s. The following charts update the previous chart, showing interest rates and inflation rates through 1990 so you can see how different the 1980s were from the 1970s. The monetary policy moves that ended the 1970s' decade-long period of rising inflation, rising nominal interest rates, and low real interest rates created the 1980s' period of falling inflation and a relatively high real interest rate environment, which began a long period of falling interest rates. With those things happening and profit margins widening, the 1980s were more opposite from than similar to the 1970s. They were almost ideal for the markets and the economy because strong growth was accompanied by falling inflation, falling interest rates, and big stock and bond market gains in the US and most developed countries. From the early 1980s to the early 1990s, inflation fell a lot and interest rates and the tightness of credit fell even more, thus shifting the environment from one that was great for lender-creditors and terrible for borrower-debtors to one that was slightly good for borrower-debtors and slightly bad for lender-creditors.

USA ESTIMATED REAL RATES

In the 1980s, the previously described tight money and short dollar (debt) conditions drove the dollar higher until 1985 when there was the Plaza Accord, which was an agreement to get the dollar to fall, which it would have done anyway because the large current account deficit and the large demand for dollars were unsustainable.

Throughout these years, there were big swings in interest rates and inflation that felt massive as you lived through them. But the overall dynamic is clear (as seen in the prior chart): in the 1980s, inflation rates fell as a result of the tightness of money in the 1980-82 period.

Then nominal interest rates also fell, following inflation down but keeping real interest rates relatively high. Those high real rates were great for lender-creditors and terrible for borrower-debtors. And then when nominal interest rates fell after inflation began to fall, it was great for bond and stock prices because the discount rate used to value future cash flows fell, and the lower rates made borrowing easier. All of this was good for economic activity. And along with declining inflation, it created an ideal set of circumstances for US markets and the economy.

But where was this transfer of wealth from? It came from the borrower-debtors who held high-interest debt liabilities and debt assets, especially emerging market borrower-debtors who had borrowed in dollars and had their earnings in local currency, and those that lent to them (especially US multinational banks). The cycle that they experienced was classic. The high interest rates not only made dollar debt more expensive to service, but they also helped drive a rally in the dollar. Those countries that had debt liabilities and debt assets denominated in the tight foreign currency that they couldn't print (US dollars) faced debt default problems, while those countries that had debts in currencies that they could print had their currencies plunge in value due to the money printing. In other words, that produced monetary inflation (i.e., inflation in the currencies they could print) and monetary deflations in the currencies that they owed and couldn't print.

The debt bubbles of the late 1970s turned into classic debt busts when there was a big tightening that tortured both sides with an ugly deleveraging in the 1980s. Those countries facing debt busts, including many emerging countries, experienced a classic full debt cycle over these 20-plus years that included inflationary depressions because there were great debt monetizations that depreciated the value of the money and debt denominated in their local currencies while they had deflationary debt default problems in the foreign currency debt that they couldn't monetize. That cycle transpired in accordance with the template laid out in Part II. The debt busts for these countries created a classic "lost decade" with inflationary depressions in these countries and classic debt workouts for the banks that had lent to them. Eventually, in 1991, there was a classic end to the debt bust that occurred in the way described in Part II—i.e., the local currency debt was devalued and the foreign currency debt was restructured. Also, near the end of the cycle, most overly indebted governments sold their government assets to build foreign exchange reserves, and they linked their domestic currencies to the dollar, completing their Big Debt Cycles.

Of course, each country experienced its own cycle and we will explore a few of these cases, notably China and Japan in Chapters 15 and 16, respectively. But there were also important geopolitical shifts during this time that impacted the Big Cycle for all nations in important ways.

During the 1980s, the geopolitical landscape changed as the Soviet Union declined, China rose, and wealth gaps increased. These changes were mostly driven by the Soviet Union's inadequate financial and economic system. More specifically, the United States had much more money and productivity than the Soviet Union and so it outcompeted the Soviet Union in most everything; notably on the military. That led to the Soviet Union's debt, economic, currency, political, and geopolitical collapses, which were manifest in the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 and the official collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

Deng Xiaoping coming to power in China in 1978 brought about big changes in the 1980s that have had big impacts on shaping the changing world order up until now. Deng's ascension ushered in the beginning of China's capitalist-like era and the start of its big debt/ credit/money/economic cycle. Before then, there was little debt/ credit/savings/economic activity. Deng changed that by creating China's "open door" and "reform" policies, which brought in foreign capitalists with their money and their talent. This swing from pure and extreme communism to market-oriented, capitalism-infused "communism" had a huge impact on China and the rest of the world. That shift unleashed a wave of productivity that led China to become the greatest trading and manufacturing power ever because it was able to produce many tradable goods at much lower costs than could be produced elsewhere. This also had a huge impact on China and other countries, as we will explore later. Because of my relationships in China and my knowledge of financial markets, I was able to contribute to and watch up close China's big transformation during this period. I will explain China's Big Cycle evolution in much more detail in Chapter 15. Suffice it to say for now that China became extremely productive, to the degree that it swamped the world with attractively priced items, earned a ton of money, and lent a ton of money to Americans and others so they could buy Chinese goods. So, Americans got the goods and the Chinese got Americans' debt and I'm still trying to work out who got the better deal.

In the 1980s, the most important big inventions were laptop computers, lithium-ion batteries, the internet, the digitization of thinking, apps, and DNA profiling, and big advancements were made in GPS, video game consoles, microprocessors, and satellite television. Americans remained the leading inventors and investors while other countries were the leading producers. Most importantly, in the 1980s, the technology development force, in which entrepreneurs were supported by capitalists, led to the internet being developed, which led to the launching of the World Wide Web in 1991 and the dot-com bubble emerging in the 1990s. This led to the dot-com bubble bursting in 2000, when the Fed tightened money to rein in the rapid debt-financed speculation on the dot-com miracle.

### FROM 1990 TO 2000: MORE DISINFLATION AND LEVERAGING UP, WHICH LED TO A BUBBLE

In brief, as with all decades, the 1990s brought many developments that seemed giant at the time and are barely memorable in retrospect. I wonder if I am giving you too much detail or not enough. To me, at the time these events were unfolding, every minute seemed like an eternity; now I struggle to remember them, which led to my principle that  $\bullet$  everything seems bigger up close. This has helped me keep things in perspective and navigate changes.

Looking back, I am happy to see that I did well navigating them, which I know is because of what I learned and am trying to convey in this study. I hope to show you these events in the context of the Big Cycle so you can put things in perspective and see how the five big forces work and are interrelated. In brief, the changes I'd highlight are described here.

In the mid-1980s and early 1990s, tight money and abundant commodity supplies led commodity producers to sell at low prices. More specifically, the investment into commodity production in the 1970s/early 1980s led to a lot more supply at the same time as money was tight, and producers that had dollar-denominated debt were squeezed. These factors caused the prices of key commodities to collapse in the mid-1980s and stay relatively low through the 1990s. That caused the flow of money and credit to commodity producers to dry up. As is typical, these big financial/economic changes that came from the debt/credit/money turning down led to big changes in domestic and international orders. For instance, these tight money and strong dollar conditions led to oil prices averaging only around 20 per barrel from 1986 to 1991, and these very low oil prices had a big negative impact on the Soviet Union and contributed to its fall, which greatly changed the world order.

The collapse of the Soviet Union ushered in an era of globalization. Amazing new technologies were developed during this period, most importantly, Wi-Fi, smartphones, and e-commerce, and further big advancements were made in GPS, video games, and perhaps most significantly artificial intelligence. As in all Big Cycles, these big inventions were financed and accompanied by debt and equity cycles (e.g., the steam engine and the railroads come to mind). In this case, the early development led to excitement that turned into a bubble (in 1995-99), which contributed to an overheating economy and rising inflation, which led the central bank (in this case, the Fed) to tighten monetary policy, which burst the bubble (in this case, in March 2000).

which produced a short-term cyclical downturn in the markets and the economy, which ended when the tighter credit and the downturn reduced inflation, which led the Fed to ease monetary policy in the classic way.

For highly competitive, low-labor-cost countries, especially those in Asia, this era of globalization, combined with the decline in commodity prices, created a boom lasting from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. China started the process of joining the World Trade Organization in the 1990s, which would later bring about an era of its inexpensive goods flooding world markets and China becoming very rich and financially and economically powerful. As is classic, the boom produced debt bubbles. In 1997-98, that bubble popped, and there was the Asian financial crisis, which, while concentrated in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea, affected all countries in the region in the "Asian Contagion." As is typical, these debt/economic crises led to internal social and political conflicts in all those countries to varying degrees. These crises were all very classic in following the previously described process and exhibiting all the classic leading indicators.

In Europe, the need for countries to operate as an economic unit and to be of a scale that allowed it to compete with other economic blocs—and the need for the European economic bloc to have a coordinated currency policy—led to the major European countries linking their currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Because a system of separate currencies held together with separate monetary policies doesn't work, this ERM broke up, which was one of the great trades of the 1990s for those who understood how currencies work, and eventually led to the abandonment of individual currencies and central banks and the making of one currency (the euro) and one central bank (the European Central Bank) in 1999. The major European countries made these choices to unify despite the unimaginable challenge of bringing together such different and independent people who had a long history of fighting because in this globalized world they were not viable economic or geopolitical powers if operating separately as individual nations. The EU remains a highly fragmented union that is declining in competitiveness.

Also in this period, in the US, President Clinton succeeded in transforming a large budget deficit into a budget surplus, so it's one of a number of cases worth remembering to help us think about how to handle things well.

### FROM 2000 TO 2008: FROM THE BUBBLE BURSTING TO DELEVERAGING TO RELEVERAGING TO CREATING A NEW BUBBLE THAT POPPED AND LED TO THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS AND DEBT MONETIZATION

- Investors typically make the mistake of thinking that great companies in great industries are great investments because they don't pay enough attention to the prices that they have to pay to invest in them. Bubbles are made when there is a lot of thinking in that way and a lot of borrowing to lever up those purchases. Bubbles are most typically burst when central banks tighten monetary policies and interest rates rise. That's what happened in 2000. The debt/asset bubble burst in March 2000, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling by around 80\% . To make things worse, on September 11, 2001, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked, which began the "war on terror" and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Both of these events (though primarily the first) contributed to a contraction in the short-term debt cycle.

The next charts show this dynamic well. In the bubble (1), unemployment rates fell to quite low levels, and stock prices rose to bubble levels. Both reversed in the early 2000s (2). These things led to a recession, which reduced inflation and led to the next short-term debt cycle easing of credit, which then led to a recovery (3). From 2006 to 2007, another classic bubble developed; while it was most prominent in real estate mortgages, it was also in banks and companies.

These were the last two short-term debt cycles in the MP1 era. In the 27 years from 1981 (when interest rates hit "the highest levels since the birth of Jesus Christ") to 2008 (when interest rates hit $0\%$), the Big Cycle consisted of four short-term debt/credit/economic cycles. From 1981 until 2008, every cyclical high and every cyclical low in interest rates was lower than the one before it, until interest rates hit $0\%$. That ended the MP1 monetary era (in which central banks' monetary policies were implemented with interest rate changes) as it was replaced by quantitative-easing-driven monetary policy (MP2).

Having studied the big cycles from 1918 to 1945, from the end of World War I to the start of the new monetary system that began when World War II ended, we at Bridgewater put into our investment system rules that if there was a debt contraction crisis and short-term Treasury and Fed funds interest rates nearly hit  $0\%$ , we would bet on a bad contraction until the central government and the central banks became very stimulative in the ways they became stimulative in March 1933. That served us well in 2008 because we understood it, so we were able to navigate the crisis well for our clients. I also saw from my study of history that the declines of real and nominal interest rates shifted conditions from those that benefited lender-creditors back to those that favored borrower-debtors, which allowed debt/income levels to rise. This downward trend in interest rates and increase in debt burdens set the stage for the next major shift in monetary policy, which we will explore in the next chapter.

USA REAL YIELD

Before I describe the MP2 era in depth, I will touch on the other big forces at play in the 2000s.

Despite the tech stock bubble bursting in 2000, the internet tech industry and its effects on the world continued to grow and improve rapidly. Social media began in the middle of the 2000s (e.g., Facebook in 2004, YouTube in 2005). The iPhone was released in 2007, which created the "everything device" because of all the things it has on it (phone, camera, and many tools in apps). It was a period in which the internet and computing impacted just about every aspect of life. The US system led these developments far more than others, though around this time China began to copy and compete effectively.

China and other emerging market producers became more competitive in producing most everything, from everyday goods (apparel, toys, appliances, etc.) in the 1990s and 2000s to electric vehicles and high-tech goods now. This was wonderful for the Chinese sellers who earned a lot of money and for the American and other buyers who benefited from good-value purchases, though it put a lot of manufacturing workers in the US and Europe out of work. The US was also helped by the fact that Chinese sellers were lending the money they were making back to the US to fund its deficits. This dynamic worked essentially the same way for the Chinese as it had worked previously for Japanese goods manufacturers and their customers. In this case, it was the Chinese who were earning money by selling to Americans and lending money they earned back to Americans by buying US debt assets. China, like Japan before it, put a sizable amount of its earnings into its foreign exchange reserves, which led it to buy a lot of US Treasuries because the dollar was the world's leading reserve currency. That enabled the US government to ramp up deficits and debts without too much consequence (at least so far) while also helping to keep global goods inflation down, which allowed central banks to keep monetary policy easier and contributed to bull markets in stocks. This dynamic was good for the capitalists who owned the means of production and not good for the workers who were displaced.

While there were wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there weren't big wars between big world powers. But the seeds were being sown for conflict. The European Union and NATO continued to take in more Eastern European countries and move closer to the Russian border. And as China got much richer, it began to rival the US as a geopolitical power, increasing tensions.

Risks from acts of nature increased. Climate change, which had first received significant attention as an area for global policy action in the 1990s, began to bring about destructive weather events, like Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans in 2005. These impacts grew more and more costly with time. During this period, global health authorities monitored novel virus outbreaks including SARS in 2002-03 and H1N1 in 2009. Neither turned out to be as disruptive as feared, but they were symptomatic of challenges to come.

Politically in the US during this period, the president was a moderate rightist, George W. Bush. The House and Senate were narrowly controlled by Republicans. Republicans and members of Congress voted across party lines more often, and government was much more bipartisan than it is at the time of this writing.
