# 2008 to 2020: Fiat Money and Debt Monetization

In 2008, there was a big deleveraging—the global financial crisis. It was led by the mortgage/real estate sector being financed by a lot of debt, which led to big debt problems that spread quickly to affect almost everyone in all countries, like the Great Depression in the 1930s. The debt crisis that started with the mortgage/real estate sector spread to take down leveraged banks, companies, and individuals and to knock down financial assets and the real economy. Unemployment hit  $10\%$  in late 2009, and major stock indices were down over  $50\%$  from their peak in 2007.

In late 2008, the interest-rate-driven monetary system (Monetary Policy 1) could no longer be used to create money and credit anymore because interest rates hit  $0\%$ , and because that could not continue, central banks had to make up for inadequate free-market demand to buy these debt assets by printing money and buying the assets themselves. As a result, a new monetary system (MP2)—where central banks buy large quantities of debt and provide credit funded with their balance sheets, which is essentially printing money, debt monetization, and quantitative easing $^{39}$ —replaced MP1. In MP2, the central bank creates and provides money and credit to the government and marketplace to make up for an inadequate amount of private market lending. That began in 2008 and was the first time this monetary policy had been used since 1933 (i.e., 75 years earlier). Such moves to monetize debt have occurred throughout history and are symptomatic of being in the late phase of the long-term debt cycle.

During this part of the Big Debt Cycle, the central bank becomes the big buyer and big owner of debt (i.e., the big creditor) rather than private investors. Because the central bank doesn't mind having losses from holding the debt that has reduced in value and because it doesn't worry about getting squeezed, it can continue to prevent a debt crisis by printing money and buying debt. It is willing and able to lose lots of money and have a negative net worth to protect the spending ability of both the government and the private sector even when their finances are bad. One can see this occur via changes in central bank balance sheets by looking at their holdings of debt assets that were acquired by providing those who sold the debt assets to central banks with cash and credit. The central banks of the US, Europe, and Japan own roughly $15\%$, $30\%$, and $40\%$ of central government debt, respectively, and roughly $5\%$, $10\%$, and $20\%$ of the total debt, respectively. In the charts that follow, you can see how this process unfolded in the US. Note the timing of the hitting of the $0\%$ interest rate bottom and the printing-of-money expansion of the Fed's balance sheet. Because the Fed responded quickly to the problem—much more so than during the Great Depression—the markets and economy rebounded quickly.

YIELD CURVE

The real bond yield has averaged about  $2\%$  over the last 100 years (indicated in the following charts by the dashed line), which is neither too low for borrower-debtors nor too high for lender-creditors. Periods of great differences from this  $2\%$  were times of excessively cheap or excessively expensive credit/debt that contributed greatly to the big swings in the Big Debt Cycle.

In this new MP2 era (2008-20), there were two short-term debt/credit/economic cycles. In each, the amount of debt creation and the amount of debt monetization was greater than the one before it.

USA MONETARY BASE (\% GDP)

While the 2008 crisis began in the US, it spilled over into a global crisis, and virtually all developed world central banks followed the US and transitioned from MP1 to MP2 (and many emerging market central banks did, too). These actions pushed up the prices of financial assets and pushed down the yields for lender-creditors and created cheap money for borrower-debtors. The stimulative monetary policies that flowed through the system further benefited the rich, who had financial assets. The government bailing out the banks contributed to the perception that the system favored the rich, which heightened animosity toward the rich capitalists, especially those who seemed to cause the problems and got away free and made a lot of money. Ultimately, the US was able to manage its private sector debt problems and engineer an economic recovery, even as public debt kept rising (effectively kicking the can down the road; more on that in Chapter 18).

The continuing increases in imports of Chinese and other foreign-produced goods took away American jobs at the same time that new technology was taking away jobs. These forces contributed to the hollowing out of the middle class, which increased tensions between the "elites/capitalists" and the "proletariat." China came to hold a lot of US debt assets, and the US lost lots of jobs in uncompetitive businesses, which in the US contributed to the creation of large wealth and values differences, anti-China sentiment, and great political and social polarization. People who were hurting economically, they believed that the "elites" running things and the system they controlled were maximizing their profits at the expense of American workers. That, along with the 2008 debt/economic crisis and the fact that the government bailed out financial institutions and benefited those who held financial assets more than it was perceived to have helped the common man, also had a big impact on domestic conflict. As a result, the financial crisis led to a shift toward populism of the right (e.g., the Tea Party movement) and populism of the left (e.g., Occupy Wall Street).

Conflict between the politically and socially right and the politically and socially left became greater in response to growing wealth and values differences in most countries, especially in the United States. In the US, the rise of populism of the right, especially among the non-college-educated, non-urban white population, led to Donald Trump's election in 2016. That changed the American approach to its domestic order and the world order in profound ways that wouldn't be understood for many years (and, at the time of my writing in March 2025, still are not fully understood). I will describe these changes more extensively at the end of Chapter 14. However, said succinctly, President Trump produced a shift in the domestic, international, economic, political, and geopolitical orders to be much more aggressive, top-down/autocratic, rightist, nationalistic, protectionist, and militaristic. These shifts in policies to ones that are characterized by increased confrontation and reduced levels of cooperation (and that are also reflected in the breakdown of multilateral organizations and increased unilateralism) are analogous to those that occurred many times throughout history, most recently in the periods before World War I and World War II.

Trump's election led to rightist policies of big tax cuts for companies and individuals, the appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, big cuts in government regulations, the renegotiation of trade and military support deals with other countries, big tariffs, and immigration restrictions. Cutting income and corporate taxes and reducing regulations helped stock prices rise and the economy grow, so the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low of  $3.5\%$  by the end of 2019. Then COVID, the first major global pandemic since the 1918-20 H1N1 pandemic, came along in early 2020.

For those who are interested, these developments and their outcomes are explained in more detail in Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order and are analogous to those in the early 1930s. They are not unexpected if one understands the Big Cycle.

The big debt, political, and geopolitical cycles and the relationships between them have been unfolding in pretty classic ways so they have been contributors to the Overall Big Cycle transpiring in pretty classic ways. What we saw and are now seeing are these three big cycles transpiring along with big disruptions coming from nature (i.e., the pandemic and climate change) and with big advances in technology, especially artificial intelligence (which should greatly improve productivity and be disruptive in other ways, too).

In Europe, events closely followed the template that I laid out previously, though Europe in 2012 consisted of 17 countries in the Eurozone, some debtors, and some creditors, which made the process more difficult. The overly indebted countries that had their debts denominated in a currency they couldn't print (the euro) suffered in the way I described, and the European Central Bank handled the situation in the typical way. I will use Greece as an example of how the cycle transpired and what happened to the heavily indebted countries that couldn't print their own currency because they were tied to the euro. To show how the cycle tracked the template, I will restate what typically happens and then show what actually happened.

## 1. The private sector and central government get deep in debt. In the 10 years prior to the 2008 financial crisis, Greece's total debt as a percent of GDP increased by around $90\%$, from $160\%$ to $250\%$. The impetus was Greece joining the euro, making the country's debt assets seem much safer (no devaluation risk, backstop from the ECB). Capital flowed in from across the Eurozone, and debt increased in every sector.

## 2. The private sector suffers a debt crisis, and the central government gets deeper in debt to help. When the 2008 financial crisis hit, the Greek government responded with stimulus and bigger deficits that added to its debt. Because they couldn't monetize debt, this worsened rather than alleviated the debt crisis, so Greece entered a deep depression.

## 3. The central government experiences a debt squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt falls short of the supply of it. That creates a government debt problem. The debt crisis became an acute public sector debt crisis in late 2009, and the Greek government revealed that it had been substantially underreporting its own debt and deficits.

## 4. The selling of the government's debt leads to a) a free-market-driven tightening of money and credit, which leads to b) a weakening of the economy, c) downward pressure on the currency, and d) declining reserves as the central bank attempts to defend the currency. The obviously crushing debt burdens and the reporting fraud made Greek debt much less desirable to foreign investors, so they became sellers of Greek debt, and Greece needed more stimulus to offset its depression-like conditions. Unavoidably, Greece pursued austerity, which caused the depression to get deeper and made government finances worse as tax receipts dried up. The result was a massive sell-off in Greek debt, which raised interest rates even higher and worsened the debt problem. By 2012, short-term interest rates in Greece had spiked to over  $70\%$ . Greek debt increased another roughly  $70\%$  of GDP, a combination of austerity not working and GDP declining (a dynamic I call an "ugly deleveraging").

## 5. When there is a debt crisis and interest rates can't be lowered (e.g., they hit  0\% ), the central bank "prints" (creates) money and buys bonds to ease credit and make it easier to service debt. Actually, it doesn't literally print money; it essentially borrows reserves from commercial banks that it pays a very short-term interest rate on. The ECB stepped in with huge amounts of crisis money printing and buying of debt, and expanded its balance sheet just as the Fed had. But that wasn't nearly enough, and it became politically toxic as the more financially stable European countries decried this bailout of Greece, worrying that one way or another they would have to pay for it.

## 6. If interest rates rise, the central bank loses money because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought. We did not see this dynamic in this case. This typically happens when the central bank has purchased significant government debt at a fixed rate, financed via creating bank reserves that pay floating short rates, and then is forced to raise short rates because of flight from the currency or an inflation problem creating a negative net interest margin for the central bank and forcing the central bank to continue printing money to cover those losses. In the case of the European debt crisis, we saw the central bank purchase significant government debt and finance it via creating bank reserves, but in that period, Europe as a whole did not see an inflation problem or currency flight, so the ECB was not forced to raise interest rates and never had a negative net interest margin problem.

## 7. Debts are restructured and devalued, reducing debt burdens. It became clear that Greece needed a debt restructuring, and the money the ECB was spending on Greece was likely to lead to losses. There was even a chance Greece would leave the euro. Meanwhile, the exceedingly tight credit in Greece was crushing the economy. Ultimately, what was called "the Troika" (the ECB, the IMF, and the European Commission) engineered a debt restructuring paired with a bailout. In 2012, that restructuring reduced debt burdens by about  $50\%$  of GDP.
## 8. Extraordinary taxes are raised, and capital flees the country and/or capital controls are imposed. There was a bank run as smart citizens pulled money out of Greek banks. Needing money, new taxes were introduced, and capital controls were eventually imposed in 2015.

## 9. There is a transition from a severely devalued currency to a stable currency. This restructuring was enough to end the most acute phase of the crisis, and Greece stayed in the euro. Reducing debt through an explicit restructuring is usually the more painful, drawn-out path. Greece took years to recover, but it did recover as all countries eventually do. If Greece and other overly indebted countries could have printed the currencies they owed, they would have gone down the classic path that was previously described for countries in that position.

Here are some other key developments that I'll note briefly but not digress into:

- Regarding international relations, there were big resets economically and geopolitically that led to more allied and enemy geopolitical relationships that were analogous to those that occurred in the 1933-38 period (and numerous prior analogous periods). If you want to get into them, they are covered in Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order.
- Climate change started to get a lot of attention. In 2015, there was the Paris Agreement, which initiated an attempt to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius. Climate change is a big force that is very costly and will reshape what the human and natural worlds look like.
- Regarding new technologies, computer chips rapidly advanced, cryptocurrencies were launched, self-driving-car features started rolling out, movie streaming became more widespread, 4G (and then 5G) wireless began, reusable rocket ships began to be used, and many more advances were made.
