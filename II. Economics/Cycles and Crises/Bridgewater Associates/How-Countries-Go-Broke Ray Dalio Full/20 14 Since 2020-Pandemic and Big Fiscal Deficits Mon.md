## SINCE 2020—

### PANDEMIC AND BIG FISCAL

### DEFICITS MONETIZED

In 2020, the world was hit with the COVID pandemic. While there is a government financial management principle in the US and in many other countries that monetary policy should be independent of fiscal policy and be targeted to pursue inflation and, in the US case, economic growth goals, because without that independence and that independent mandate there would be the politicization and degradation of the supply and value of money, the truth is that nearly every sacrosanct rule is inevitably tested by reality and starts to break down later in the Big Cycle.

I call that economic-impact-necessitated change in monetary policy Monetary Policy 3 (MP3). MP3 is when there are coordinated moves between the central government and the central bank, where the government runs large deficits and the bank monetizes them. The dynamic inevitably arises when interest rate changes (MP1) and quantitative easing (MP2) are no longer effective at helping conditions for most people and when the free-market capitalist system doesn't get the job done. Naturally, the capitalist system provides capital to those who are financially well-off, hold financial assets, and are able to borrow, and it doesn't provide capital to those who have the least and suffer the most. That is what happened starting in 2008. But, because of the

COVID pandemic, there was a need not just to make money and credit, but also to get it into the hands of specific people and organizations. Throughout history, MP3 has been used in similar cases when there were very bad economic conditions and big wealth gaps so interest rate changes or quantitative easing alone could not do what was needed. MP3 typically occurred late in the long-term debt cycle. In this case, it came in two big rounds.

What follows are a few of the previously shown key charts brought up to the time of my writing. They do a good job of painting the big picture both in terms of what has happened since 2020 and in putting what has happened into perspective within the Big Debt Cycle. As you can see, in the context of the big picture shown in the long-term charts going back to 1945, the weekly, monthly, and even annual changes seem trivial. I hope these charts help you to see the more important bigger pictures.

### DEBT LEVELS AND DEBT SERVICE

The central government spends a lot and hands out lots of money, getting itself into much more debt while relieving the private sector's debt burdens. In the following charts, the gray vertical lines represent transitions from one type of monetary policy to another.

### MONETARY POLICY AND CENTRAL BANK HEALTH

The Fed's printing of money and buying of the government's debt increased a lot from 2008 until late 2021, after which the Fed began tightening to fight inflation. That was a pretty classic tightening in response to accelerated inflation. The tightening and higher interest rates led the Fed to lose money on all the bonds it had acquired, as shown in the chart on the right.

### INTEREST RATES

The rise in interest rates, while significant, was less significant than the rise in inflation (the chart on the left), though it brought the real bond yield up to its long-term average of $\sim 2\%$ (the charts on the right and at the bottom).

### BREAKDOWN OF INTEREST RATES

The yield curve inverted; the discounted 10-year inflation rate stayed steady at around $2\%$ as the real yield rose to about $2\%$. These moves reflected the tightening.

### THE WEALTH AND INCOME SHIFTS

Labor's share of earnings continued to trend down to the lowest level since the 1950s, and the wealth and income shares of non-college-educated Americans continued to fall, so the wealth and values gap issue grew worse.

USA INCOME SHARE

During this period, the US population and political parties became much more divided and more extreme, and there was a change in 2020 in leadership from the Trump-led rightist Republicans to the Biden-led leftist Democrats.

I am now going to look in more detail at what happened between 2020 and the present (i.e., March 2025), shifting from my Big Cycle perspective down to the short-term cycle that is transpiring within the long-term Big Cycle. That shift from the macro of several decades to the relative micro of years and months can seem disorienting. It can seem like shifting from big, important forces to small, unimportant forces, but that is not true as the small short term affects the big long term as much as the big long term affects the small short term. Most importantly, between 2020 and now there was a pandemic, which led to a big economic contraction, which led to a huge coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulation (MP3), which raised inflation and markets and redistributed wealth, which produced a big surge in inflation, which led to a tightening that helped to bring down inflation, which led to a relatively modest easing. It was a time of continued movement to greater political polarization and the political shift to the right and back to a Trump presidency, which were also accompanied by big changes in climate and technologies.

### More specifically:

- This short-term debt cycle easing began in 2020 in response to the combination of a) a COVID-induced economic crisis, b) large wealth gaps, and c) political moves to the left via the elections of a Democratic president, a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, and a Democratic-controlled Senate. The easing took the form of huge government spending increases that led to huge government fiscal deficits and government debt sales that were much greater than free-market lender-creditors would buy, which required central banks, most importantly the Fed, to buy/monetize the debt. Other entities like banks and Japanese institutional investors also bought a lot of US Treasury debt. That stimulation increased the amount of debt/credit/money/spending by a lot. This massive MP3-type of coordination of fiscal and monetary policies that allows the government to borrow and direct money as it chooses because the central bank buys its debt with printed money is explained more completely in Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises, if you're interested in knowing more and seeing past cases, which you can download at economicprinciples.org. That is what happened in 2020-21; as mentioned, it has happened repeatedly for similar reasons throughout history though not in our lifetime.
- The 2020-21 debt monetization was the fourth  $^{43}$  and the largest big debt monetization since the original big debt monetization/QE in 2008 (which was the first since 1933). From the start of the easing cycle of 2008, the nominal Treasury bond yield was pushed down from  $3.7\%$  to only  $0.5\%$ , the real Treasury bond yield was pushed from  $1.4\%$  to  $-1\%$ , and the non-government nominal and real bond yields fell a lot more (because credit spreads narrowed). Money and credit became essentially free and plentiful, so the environment became great for borrower-debtors and terrible for lender-creditors and led to an orgy of borrowing and new bubbles forming. My bubble indicator, which was at only $18\%$ in 2010, rose to $75\%$ at the end of 2020, showing the bubbles in companies and assets that had little or no profits and were funded by selling equity and/or borrowing money based on promises of doing well in the future and speculative buying fever. It was analogous to the Nifty Fifty bubble in the 1970-72 period, the Japan bubble of 1989-90, and the dot-com bubble of 1999-2000. The decline in interest rates in the years following 2008 took them so low that they couldn't continue to fall, and it benefited stocks a lot. I estimate that the interest rate decline raised stock prices about $75\%$ more than they would have risen without that decline (compared to the pre-financial-crisis peak). In addition, profit margins roughly doubled on average as a result of advances in technology and globalization, which also boosted profits and profit margins. Corporate and personal taxes declined, which also helped asset prices. From the post-crisis lows of 2009 through the second quarter of 2024, the nominal value of US household wealth in financial assets (i.e., "paper wealth") rose from \$32 trillion to \$99 trillion, so there was a tripling of paper wealth.[44]
- That debt/credit/money surge in 2020 produced a big increase in inflation, which was exacerbated by supply chain problems and external conflicts (the third of the five major forces that I will touch on at the end of this chapter).
- That big increase in inflation led to the short-term debt cycle tightening by the Fed and the contraction in the balance sheet by having maturing debt roll off rather than buying more of it. As a result of the Fed (and other central banks), changing their short-term debt cycle mode from easing to tightening, nominal and real interest rates went from levels that were overwhelmingly favorable to borrower-debtors and detrimental to lender-creditors to levels that were more normal (e.g., a $2\%$ real bond yield). Once the tightening began, US Treasury bond nominal yields rose from $0.5\%$ to over $4\%$ and real yields rose from about $-1.1\%$ to about $2.5\%$, which hurt most asset prices, particularly those with weak or negative profits and/or needs for new equity funding. Naturally, that shift especially hurt the prices of assets that were in bubbles. My bubble indicator fell from $75\%$ (in a significant bubble) to $35\%$ (not in a bubble) and the bubble stocks in the index fell an average of $75\%$. As a result, the nominal value of wealth in stocks and bonds fell by $\sim 12\%$ in the US and the real value of wealth fell by nearly $18\%$, which were the largest declines since 2009. As cash (i.e., investing in short-term cash instruments like T-Bills) went from "trash" to "attractive," and both short-term nominal and real interest rates were brought to levels that were more attractive than they were for lender-creditors and more unattractive than they were for borrower-debtors, and the yield curve inverted, these changes had the very classic effect of lowering the present values of most investment assets' future cash flows and strengthening the dollar relative to the currencies of other countries whose central bankers were slower to tighten. In other words, the Fed's quick movement brought US dollar-denominated cash to relatively attractive levels in relation to most assets, cash denominated in other currencies, and gold. This, as usual, hurt interest-rate-sensitive sectors like commercial and residential real estate, as well as low or negative cash flow bubble companies, both public and private, though public more so. For example, the then-hot "FAANG" stocks and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell from their peaks by around  $45\%$  and  $33\%$ , respectively. Non-public-market assets—private equity, venture capital,

and real estate assets—were not marked down commensurately as there was a great reluctance to accept the markdowns. Write-downs and having to downfundraising rounds became too painful for both the companies and the venture capital and private equity managers in these markets, so there has been, to this day, a stand-off in which sellers and buyers can't agree on prices and transaction volumes have plunged. It did not, however, weaken the economy as much as it typically would have because it was the central government that got into more debt rather than the private sector and it was the central bank that bought the debt and had the losses from holding it rather than the private sector. Also, the inflation was in wages and other compensation being earned as well as in goods and services being bought.

- Then inflation fell but prices stayed high, and the Fed and other central banks eased their monetary policies, which supported asset prices generally. Artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence companies became the new hot things and are expected to improve the economy and life hugely like the new hot things that produced the industrial and digital revolutions and led to financial bubbles. With these changes came great differences in which stocks, companies, and countries did well. Also, the world capital markets changed with new types of investment products, though in the same sort of ways we saw before. For example, we are seeing new types of lending, like the development of the private credit market, which is the modern-day version of the junk bond market of the late 1970s and early 1980s (though more customized, not securitized, more illiquid, and inclusive of early-stage companies). The large amount of money entering this type of lending helped to keep credit spreads down and fund more speculative activities.
- Regarding the internal conflicts over wealth and values between the populists of the right and the populists of the left, the intensity increased in most democracies, most importantly in the US. In the US, the divide between the political right and the political left became more extreme, and the big rises in prices that came from the earlier-described big fiscal and monetary stimulations by the US central government and central bank led to big price increases in goods, services, and financial assets. In the 2024 election, this inflation and other factors, such as President Biden's impaired acuity, helped a) the rightist/capitalist/social conservative Donald Trump and the Republican Party to a decisive win over b) the leftist/socialist/social liberal Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party, giving Trump a mandate to undertake a big renovation of the central government and the country as a whole and prepare for some type of war with China and its allies. The potential great conflict that would have likely occurred if there was a close Trump loss was averted, and huge changes to the US domestic order began.

Climate changes continued unabated.

- Technological advances, most notably in artificial intelligence but in several other areas as well, led to big shifts in wealth and power.

That brings us up to where we now are.

### THE FIVE BIG FORCES: DEBT, CIVIL WAR, INTERNATIONAL WAR, ACTS OF NATURE, AND TECHNOLOGY

Every day we see news about these five forces. If you connect the dots from the past to the present, you can see them evolving along the lines of the Big Cycle template that was comprehensively explained in my book as well as my 40-minute and five-minute videos about the changing world order, on economicprinciples.org. Government debt is obviously a big and growing issue. The thus-far

Nonviolent civil war between the rightists/capitalists/MAGAs and the leftists/socialists/communists/woke is continuing to intensify, though in the last US election the rightists clearly beat the leftists. This shift has brought the big domestic order/disorder cycle to the same stage it last was in the 1930s. Simultaneously and relatedly, the international great power conflict, particularly between the United States and its allies and China and its allies, is intensifying. Similarly, the acts of nature force, most importantly climate change, is intensifying, while technology, especially AI, will have a big impact, both good and bad, that we won't be able to imagine. As always, these five big, interrelated forces are moving the Big Cycle forward. Most importantly, the internal fight within the US and the external fight between the US and China is and increasingly will be affected by the technology war and the economic war (e.g., the need to raise military spending). For previously explained reasons, this looks quite like the 1930s period.

Because of the importance of China, I will now briefly review its whole Big Cycle starting in 1945 (when the new world order began) and 1949 (when its new domestic order began). Then I will look at Japan's Big Cycle, focusing most on how its Big Debt Cycle unfolded because it provides another good case study for gaining the valuable lessons it offers.
