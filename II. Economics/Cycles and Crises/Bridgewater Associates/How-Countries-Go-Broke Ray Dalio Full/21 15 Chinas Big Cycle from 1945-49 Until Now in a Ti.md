# 21.15 China's Big Cycle from 1945-49 Until Now in a Tiny Nutshell
## CHINA'S BIG CYCLE FROM

## 1945-49 UNTIL NOW IN

### A TINY NUTSHELL

This chapter explains how the Big Cycle has played out in China, bringing you right up to the present. It will take you about 15 minutes to read. Having spent a lot of time in China and having had very close relationships there for over 40 years, including with some of its leaders, I have seen much of it unfold from up close, so China's Big Cycle is as vivid to me as the US's Big Cycle. I think this chapter is well worth your time to read.

To put China's history in the context of its Big Cycle, I will summarize what has happened since the start of the new world order and China's domestic order in the 1945-49 period with a very brief look at what happened before then.

### BEFORE 1945

I will start by directing your attention to the following chart that shows the Big Cycles of China back to the year 600. This measure shows the estimated relative strength of China using many measures of strength as described in Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order. It shows the biggest Big Cycle waves in Chinese history.

Having studied these cycles, I have found them to be consistent with the Big Cycle template that I am touching on in this study and that I comprehensively explained in that book and the animation of the same title.

In the next chart, you can see China's Big Debt Cycles since 1865, which is 26 years after the Century of Humiliation began, until now. This 110-year period of humiliation (as the Chinese call it) was the period in which foreign powers "humiliated" and exploited China, starting in 1839 with the First Opium War and ending in 1949 with Mao and the Chinese Communist Party coming to power and the founding of the People's Republic of China. As you can see, big debts were built up, wiped out, and built up again. As is typical, the debt wipeout corresponded with internal and external wars (in 1945-49), then there was a new order, and debts were built up again. Through most of these years, Chinese money and debt were not considered a good storehold of wealth, so it was difficult to build credit and other capital markets. Then in 1989, with the development of the stock market and the beginnings of the bond market, they started building their capital markets. Because I was closely involved with this, I can tell you all about it.

CHINA TOTAL DEBT (\% GDP)

While I will not delve into a detailed discussion of China's prior Big Cycle, which encompassed the Century of Humiliation, I will touch on it because it profoundly affected Chinese leaders' perspectives about foreign powers and what is now going on domestically and internationally. That part of China's history is deeply embedded in the Chinese leadership's psyche, leading them to vow that nothing like it will happen again because China will be strong enough to fight it. More specifically, China's leaders see the US as self-interested and trying to contain China in an area of the world that the US is not part of. I am not saying that the Chinese perspective is more true than the American one. I am simply describing what happened and touching on both perspectives.

China's leaders now see America's handling of Taiwan as being even more intrusive than Americans saw Russia's influence in Cuba in the 1960s because from their perspective Taiwan has been "indisputably and consistently" recognized as part of China by all the world's powers since the end of World War II and is 90 miles away from mainland China. Chinese leaders see Taiwan as a part of China that has not been incorporated back into China, because it was given back to China after World War II but the Chinese civil war led to the

Kuomintang and its leader Chiang Kai-shek took control of it. In 1971, the UN General Assembly recognized the mainland People's Republic of China as "the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations" and reinforced the "One China" policy. That policy asserts that there is only one China, and Taiwan is part of China.

So, there is no question that Chinese leaders expect to eventually take control of Taiwan and parts of the South China Sea. In contrast, most Americans see China as a big and growing threat to the United States and the existing US-led world order, and see the Chinese as being ideologically threatening communists who autocratically control their people and who are in a great ideological war with its capitalist/democratic/Abrahamic (i.e., Jewish/Christian-Islamic) approach. Some in both Washington and Beijing see this conflict as being the last and biggest great cultural/religious/economic, and possibly military, war. Of course, this relationship is complicated, and there are at least two sides to this story, which I won't go into because it would be too large of a digression. I just wanted to make clear Chinese leaders' perspective, which has a big effect on how they think and what they do. Additionally, I want to point out that because of the very long history of the Chinese civilization, which the leaders know very well, they are very aware of the Big Cycle.

The most important things to know are that China has had a strengthening over the last 50 years that has been greater in magnitude than any other country's in history. This has led to it becoming a great power that is approaching the power of the United States, and as a result, the United States and China have entered into a classic period of great power conflict. The next two charts show my aggregate readings of relative powers since 1825 and my US-China conflict gauge since 1963. As you can see in the first chart, China's relative power fell a lot during the Century of Humiliation and then rose a lot thereafter, so that it is now close to rivaling the US. This is leading to a classic great power conflict between the US, China, and their respective allies.[45]

US-CHINA CONFLICT GAUGE

### SINCE 1945

Here is my very brief description of what has happened in China since 1945.

The end of World War II led to the creation of the new and current world order, and in 1949, China's civil war ended, which led to the creation of the new and current domestic order.

From 1949 until the 1970s, China was a strictly isolated communist country run by the revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and his chief administrator, Zhou Enlai. During those years, China recovered slowly from World War II and its civil war because it was encumbered by rigid and unproductive communist economic policies that didn't reward hard work and didn't allow savings and wealth creation, and imposed draconian controls that ensured that Mao and the Chinese Communist Party remained in power, and created isolation from the rest of the world that prevented China from benefiting from what the world had to offer. In Big Cycles, it is typical for those who win political power in a civil war to suppress the opposition in order to consolidate and solidify their power over the opposition due to fears that they will be overthrown. In Chinese dynasties, secret and violent overthrows of leaders have been frequent so they are viewed as a constant threat. That went on throughout Mao's life. Mao had many enemies, most importantly capitalists from within China and the Soviet Union (starting in the late 1950s) from outside of China. Marxist-Leninist communist principles and isolation from "foreign devils" shaped what China did and didn't do during the 1949-76 period. During Mao's reign, China's development fell behind the rest of the world's and there was a lot of suffering, especially in the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.

There was a classic confluence of economic, domestic political, and geopolitical turbulence.

As far as dealing with foreign powers was concerned, Mao's greatest fear in the early 1970s was the Soviet Union, which became increasingly threatening, starting in the 1960s. As has typically been the case throughout history and is conveyed in the adage "the enemy of my enemy is my friend," the common enemy brings countries together, which was true in this case, with the common enemy of the United States and China being the Soviet Union. That is what led to the visits to China first by Henry Kissinger and soon after by President Nixon.

Because I knew Henry Kissinger and Ji Chaozhu, who were both participants in those discussions, I heard firsthand about the thinking and the discussions that took place and can assure you that the common enemy perspective was top of mind for both sides in motivating the initiating of their "friendship" in 1972.

Mao and Zhou died in 1976. That led to big shifts in China's economic, political, and geopolitical policies.

As described in Chapter 12, Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978 and changed just about everything with his "reform" and

"open door" policies, which introduced a much freer, market-based economic system that brought in foreign talent and foreign capital to enable the Chinese to seize new opportunities. He distinguished the new way with statements like "to get rich is glorious" and when asked about his move to a more market-capitalist direction, he said, "It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice." This was the recognition that the market-capitalist systems can "catch mice" (i.e., make riches) and that it is best to get rich and powerful first and then work toward "common prosperity." These policies led to China having huge economic advances that changed not just China but the whole world. China went from being a poor, weak country to being a very strong one that was more capitalist.

I saw all this up close from 1984 until now and, through my contact with China, got to see things through Chinese leaders' eyes as we became friends working on the development of markets and the economy in China.

I started going to China in 1984 as a guest of CITIC, which was the only "window company" (so-called because it could deal with the outside world in a capitalist way). They asked me to teach them about the world's capital markets. China hardly had any money at the time, so I didn't go there to make money or be involved with their markets; I went at first because I was curious, and I've kept going until now because I love the people and culture, and I could have a good impact on the country's markets and economic development. That has given me an invaluable education as well as lots of enjoyment, so much so that I don't dare describe it entirely because it would be too great a digression. What I am now going to describe is through the lens of my experiences. I watched that combination of powerful economic reform and opening up to the outside world take China from:

## 1. a classic unproductive communist country to
## 2. an effective "socialist market economy" to
## 3. the development of its capital markets and its version of capitalism to

## 4. the forming of a classic debt bubble that led to
## 5. a classic debt bust of the type that those who have their debt denominated in their own currency and have most of the debtors and creditors as their own citizens have to
## 6. a classic great power conflict.

More specifically, China experienced a classic upward swing in the Big Cycle productivity that took China's people from terrible poverty to much-improved living standards, with many people and the country as a whole gaining great riches and powers. At the same time, there were big increases in indebtedness and developments in the capital markets that created big wealth gaps and a bubble. I witnessed up close China go from grappling with its poverty and its geopolitical weaknesses to creating its market/debt reform and "open door" policies, which created great increases in its riches and geopolitical power, to grappling with these greater wealth and geopolitical powers because with them came big wealth and opportunity gaps and big domestic and international conflicts.

In the Deng era, I saw the Big Cycle unfold up close as follows:

- China's inexpensive labor and high productivity gains provided the world with very attractively priced manufactured goods.
- The US and most of the world liked getting attractively priced manufactured goods on good terms, especially because China used a lot of the money it earned to lend money to Americans who bought the merchandise. As a result, large trade and capital imbalances developed and US manufacturers suffered, which became an unsustainable economic/capital, political, and geopolitical issue for the US.
- China's income, wealth, and power increased greatly. At the same time, the US overborrowed and started to decline. In 2008, the US had a big debt crisis that put China in the position of not knowing if a large portion of its debt assets would be paid back and questioning the United States'

financial strength. I was in the midst of that situation and must say that the Chinese side handled the debt crisis with grace and understanding.

In 2008, the Group of 20 (G20) countries, which was formed to be a more realistically representative group of powerful countries than the G7 given the shifts in world power, had its first summit to deal with the global financial crisis. They agreed to be very stimulative, so China and virtually all countries increased the credit they made available, which improved conditions, increased wealth gaps, and raised debt levels relative to income levels. As explained earlier, in the US the widening wealth gaps and economic suffering of those left behind created a change in sentiment to blame the Chinese for their job-loss problems. Those American workers who were most adversely affected were the non-college-educated men Donald Trump later appealed to. At the same time, American companies complained that they were not allowed to fairly compete in China and that the Chinese were stealing Americans' intellectual property.

China's skills and powers continued to grow, which gave China the resources to develop its economic, geopolitical, military, and technological powers, which led it to become more assertive and seemingly threatening. In 2009, pointing to an old map that demarcated the South China Sea boundary, China asserted that the proper boundaries of its territory were far beyond what other countries claimed they were. Although in 2016 the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled against China's claim, the dispute continues today.

President Xi Jinping and the new leadership team came to power in 2012. Their main goals were to reform the economy and eliminate corruption. Because of my expertise and my long and trusted relationships, I was able to participate in the discussions about these things in the third plenum (the new government's big planning meeting after the top people are appointed). I experienced a very open and collaborative environment in which key issues were discussed, and we exchanged thoughts about them openly. I found the quality of those discussions about how to eliminate corruption and make reforms to be sincere and excellent. There was a great desire and enthusiasm from the new strong leaders to improve China, and I was thrilled to be of help.

Reforming the economy meant modernizing it to be more market-driven. For example, back then, five major banks made loans to state-owned enterprises that were implicitly guaranteed by the government, which had the printing press to guarantee them, and there was little lending to smalland medium-size enterprises. The leadership wanted to change that, so they sought to develop capital markets that improved access to borrowing, lending, and investing. I was closely involved with that, so I saw how those responsible for it thought about it and what they did. I found that for most of Xi's first five-year term, there was a) an openness to outside thinking, b) a strong desire to further reform the economy by making it more market-driven and taking actions to build and reform the capital markets, and c) strong action taken to eliminate corruption. The senior leaders chosen were the ones who were inclined to do those things. Of course, how to do these things was debated, and some people benefited from the changes while others were hurt by them, which created divisions.

After coming to power, Xi immediately purged a prominent rival (Bo Xilai) and moved strongly to make big changes to eliminate corruption and reform the economy. Late in Xi's first term, there was a movement to consolidate political power around him via a move to "core leadership." If you think politics in the United States is brutal, you should see politics in China. This became most clear in the leadership changes that accompanied the shift from Xi's first five-year term to his second and then to his third.

Up until then, there were remarkable accomplishments—by many measures the greatest in human history. In the years since I first started going to China in 1984, China's per capita income increased by  $20\mathrm{x}$, the average life expectancy increased by 12 years, and the poverty rate fell from $81\%$ to less than $1\%$.

At the same time, starting in 2009, China significantly increased its levels of indebtedness in real estate, local governments, and companies. That was stimulative at the time and led to accelerating debt and the debt problem that China now faces. This problem was made worse by the severe demographic issue of the one-child policy, which has created financial problems related to pensions and eldercare. Further, the way that China's economy runs—which is driven by government, especially local government, financing and companies spending in ways that value the quantity produced over profitability and fosters severe uneconomic competition—led to profits falling short of debt service expenses. These issues remain.

Geopolitically, in 2014, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, which is a whole other story to be discussed at another time. Suffice it to say that at the time, though the Russians and the Chinese had a dislike and distrust for each other, they were drawn together by their common enemy and saw that they could have a symbiotic economic relationship.

In 2015, Xi put out his 2025 plan, which described the need for China to rise and dominate certain industries. This was viewed as aspirational by the Chinese and threatening by the Americans. China could no longer "hide power." Also, China became more threatening to other countries as it grew a lot in world trade, as its riches grew, as it asserted itself more geopolitically, and as it "stole" intellectual property. At this time, Americans began to blame China for their economic problems and viewed China as a greater threat.

Due to middle-class job losses in the US, which were attributed to Chinese imports and China's greater assertiveness internationally, the pendulum of sentiment toward China swung from positive to negative. When President Trump came to power in 2017 and President Xi began his second term in 2018, the great power conflict began in earnest, starting with trade negotiations that evolved into tests of power and a type of cold war. At the time, it became clear to Chinese leaders that the classic great power conflict was emerging. I was assured by a Chinese senior leader that the Chinese leadership didn't want to change the multilateral world order with respect to multinational organizations like the UN, the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and the IMF. This senior leader argued that the changes to the world order and threats to multilateralism were instead the result of the Trump administration's move toward a unilateral, "America First" approach, which put US interests ahead of the global community's and made containing China its top priority. By this time, Russia and China increasingly viewed the United States as the common threat, so they became more aligned.

Then in 2019-20, COVID emerged. At the same time, China's debt bubble and wealth gaps grew, and relations with the US worsened, so there was a classic convergence of big debt/financial, internal order, external order, and acts of nature forces into a risky mix. Also, the Taiwan issue was (and still is) a very big, contentious issue because China expected the One China unification promise to be delivered on while instead there seemed to be movement toward more independence. This has been intensified because most of the advanced computer chips in the world were (and still are) produced in Taiwan, and whichever country controls them controls the most powerful technology in the world. Seeing all those contentious domestic and international issues evolve, in addition to his understanding of history, led Xi to convey that there is a big 100-year storm on the horizon.

In 2018, Xi began his second five-year term with more consolidated power around him as the head of the core with four of the seven members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo as his close allies.

In 2020, much of China was shut down due to COVID, which raised some internal ire about how it was being handled. And then in 2021, a bit more than halfway through Xi's second term, China's domestic debt bubble burst. Xi emphasized the importance of "common prosperity" and did not like how rich business leaders were arrogantly seeking to exert influence over how China was being run, so the government took some seemingly arbitrary actions that were not consistent with the type of rule of law and traditional property protections that investors thought were important. The leadership also knocked back some billionaire business leaders and their businesses to put them in their place.

At the beginning of Xi's third term in October 2022, China's leadership shifted from reform-minded globalists to loyal, patriotic communists with tighter controls over the media and possible opposition, and it shifted from being highly free-market-oriented with capital markets flourishing to focusing more on achieving more common prosperity in an increasingly difficult time. It is important to remember that despite its economic advances, the great majority in China remain poor. At this time, there was a shift to economic, internal conflict, and international great power conflict policies that sounded more like those under Mao, while the conflict with the US intensified.

Now China is 1) experiencing a big debt problem at the same time as it is also turning to less capitalist "common prosperity" policies, while 2) there is increased internal political conflict that is being eliminated by more strict, autocratic policies directed by the president/chairman, while 3) there is increased international conflict with the United States and great changes in the world, which China is increasingly playing a leading role in shaping, while 4) climate change is happening and is likely to have a big effect on China, while 5) China is in a technology war that neither it nor the United States can afford to lose. Simultaneously, it is making great advances in many areas, especially in technology-enabled manufacturing that it sells very inexpensively, with emerging countries that account for $85\%$ of the world's population being China's big new target market.

At the time of my writing this in March 2025, the second Trump administration has recently come into power in the US and has to deal with 1) the big debt issue, while 2) internal conflict is leading it to employ more strict, semi-autocratic policies to overpower the opposition and its leftist policies, while 3) there is increased international conflict with China, countries aligned with it, and great changes in the world order with the US under Trump shifting from being a global leader to becoming an "America First" nationalistic participant in the changing world order, while 4) climate change is likely to have a big effect, while 5) the US is in a technology war that neither it nor China can afford to lose. The under-the-surface attacks on each other have been vicious.

So, we are now seeing a squaring-off of these two great powers, along with their allies lining up behind them and their ideologies, which looks a lot like what we saw in the 1930s when the world was at a similar stage in the Big Cycle. The trade war is now most obvious. At the same time, there is a rapprochement of the US toward China as President Trump has described President Xi as a "great leader" who "controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist." What will happen in the US and China and the world will be another test of the relative strengths of these two great powers and their two very different approaches and systems. These two great powers are now in a war that fortunately for the world hasn't yet turned into a military confrontation. This is shaping up to be the greatest great power conflict ever. Many years ago, a very senior Chinese leader explained how differently these two sides fight war; he explained to me how Western countries follow a Mediterranean approach to war, which is head-on, while the Chinese use a much subtler, deceptive approach along the lines of what was described in *The Art of War* by Sun Tzu, which was written about 2,500 years ago. Over my many years and through my close contacts in China, I have learned about the power of such timeless principles that affect Chinese leaders' approaches to dealing with

The Chinese people and the outside world.

### CHINA AND THE FIVE BIG FORCES

### In this ultra-brief summary, I will look at what has happened in China vis-à-vis my Five Big Forces template:

## 1. The debt/economic force led to China's debt rising relative to

46 A timeless guiding principle is $da$ (which means big/grand),  $tong$ (which means unity, harmony, and coordination), which dates back to ancient China (around the time of Confucius). It describes how good things should be shared by all, leadership should operate for the public good rather than for their own interests or the interests of any group, resources should be distributed equitably, and people should live in harmony. These are essential things that they will strive to get at all costs. How do they strive for them? The approaches are conveyed in 1) Confucianism (which is a series of ways of operating to have harmony through clear hierarchy and moral leadership in which the leaders put the society's well-being ahead of their self-interest and put education, meritocracy, family, quality relationships, and paternalistic governance as priorities; it was formed around 500 BCE) and 2) legalism (which emphasizes very strict rule of law and pragmatism over morality; it was formed around 250 BCE). I learned that running China as a hierarchical family is important (e.g., the word "country" in Chinese is made up of two characters that are "state" and "family"). Of some but lesser influence are Taoism, which emphasizes harmony and the nature of all things, and Buddhism, which emphasizes harmony among people and all things, the acceptance of how things are, and materialism's lack of value. By understanding such principles and how deeply rooted they are, I could understand the leadership's perspectives and their system better than if I didn't understand such things. For example, I could understand why they are inclined toward Marxism (which to them represents common prosperity), autocratic leadership, and the desirability of people in society to know their place and to faithfully follow the leader (which they believe is required for order to exist), unless the leader fails them, which will be shown in great disorder that will lead the leader/emperor to lose "the mandate of heaven" and be overthrown, which will change the dynasty/order. And I can understand how they can find capitalism and individualism antithetical to their beliefs because they see both as selfishness that will fragment people and lead to disharmony and disorder. I am not commenting on what I think of Chinese approaches versus American or more generally Western approaches other than to say that it seems to me that humanity has struggled with their relative merits (i.e., the relative merits of capitalist self-interest and democracy and communist common interest and dictatorship) and has swung back and forth between different versions of them for all recorded history. I also think that the Chinese core values about how people should be with each other are more similar to the core values that Christianity espouses than is generally recognized and that both of these are quite different from those of capitalism when capitalism is taken to an extreme. I also know that capitalism has been a far more effective approach in producing prosperity, including broad-based prosperity, than the other approaches, though that approach has tended to operate in the Big Cycle way that has produced the booms and busts that we are looking at comprehensively in this study.

Incomes, though not relative to liquid assets until 2009 (coming out of the global financial crisis). Then debt—especially local government, corporate, and real estate debt—started to grow into a bubble that burst in 2021, which began a deleveraging. Like Japan's, most of China's debt is denominated in its local currency, which allows it to engineer a "beautiful deleveraging," which Japan failed to do. We don't yet know whether China will manage this well, though it now appears to me that China has been slow to deal with it and is in the late part of the Big Debt Cycle that is most analogous to Japan in the 1990s. At the same time, China has highly competitive, innovative sectors that are not at all encumbered by debts.

## 2. The internal conflict and internal politics forced the government to tighten controls, leading to an environment of more fear, which has slowed decision-making, which has chilled the economy and hurt capital and people flows, which has contributed to economic slowness in China. It has moved about halfway back toward Maoist-Marxist communist policies. At the same time, Chinese policies have been known to swing a lot as a way of creating fear, cleaning things out, and then rebuilding.
## 3. The external conflict force led to the classic great power conflict with the United States, which has hurt flows of trade, capital, and people and led to greater military preparation and risk.
## 4. The acts of nature force took the form of the COVID pandemic problem that started in late 2019 and continued through 2022, which strained the population's satisfaction for how the leadership was handling it, which contributed to the government increasing controls. China also used its remarkable inventiveness, its government-directed economic policies, and its advanced manufacturing capabilities to make such great strides in solar and wind power that it has become the world's most cost-effective producer of these items, which is another story that I won't digress into.

## 5. The technology force led both China and the US to make advances in a number of new technologies, most importantly in advanced AI, with China seemingly having fallen behind the US in the development of the most advanced chips while at the same time excelling in inexpensive AI and advanced manufacturing, especially in robotics. China is very competitive in a number of technology areas.

So, in brief, in recent years four out of the five major forces (i.e., debt/economic, internal conflict, international conflict, and acts of nature) have become increasingly threatening to China, and the fifth, the technology force, appears to be a mixed picture of great advances and falling behind and leaping ahead of the US in different ways. In Part IV, I will tell you what I think about the future.

### APPENDIX: CHINA'S BIG DEBT CYCLE IN A FEW CHARTS

I am now going to show you a bunch of charts that do a good job of painting China's debt picture, but I won't get into an analysis with a commentary because a more complete proper analysis would be too much of a digression for now. Also, notably not all the debts are properly accounted for, so these charts are meant to just be broadly indicative.

As shown, China is in the part of the Big Debt Cycle in which non-central-government debt burdens have become excessive and a problem, so that the central government and the central bank will have to help manage it. Fortunately, most of the debt is denominated in local currency, and most of the debtors and creditors are domestic, so that the central government and the central bank have much greater ability to manage this situation than if they weren't. However, China's currency (the renminbi) is not a widely held reserve currency, so it isn't an effective store of wealth. Ideally, Chinese policymakers would have both the ability and the courage to swiftly engineer a beautiful deleveraging. However, as previously explained, such adjustments are initially painful because they cause great shifts in wealth and, if not balanced properly, can just shift the debt burdens, worsen the long-term central government debt burdens, and/or so severely undermine the value of the currency as to do great damage to the capital markets and through it to the economy. The Japanese case, and the next chapter on it, provides some valuable lessons for Chinese policymakers (as well as for other policymakers, investors, and businesspeople).

As shown, China's debts are reaching new highs, even as its economy is weaker than desired. That's been the dynamic in Japan over recent decades as well.

Next, the chart on the left shows the levels of 10-year bond yields relative to the stated one-year and three-year average headline inflation numbers. Actual deflation in both items and in investments held has been worse than shown here. Also, as shown in the chart on the right, real bond yields are about  $0.5\%$ , so a) they are relatively unattractive in a normal environment but b) still relatively attractive in relation to a deflating economy with falling asset prices and also c) relatively unattractive relative to other countries', especially the US dollar bond market's interest rates. $^{47}$  As shown in the last chart in this group, nominal government bond rates are approaching zero, so other "non-conventional" fiscal and monetary policies will likely have to be used.

CHINA ESTIMATED RATES

As shown in the following charts, the yield curve (as of late February 2025) is inverted, which makes cash relatively attractive at a time when that encourages a holding of cash, which leads to a "pushing on a string" issue. I previously conveyed my thinking about this in Chapter 1, so I won't repeat it. Also, as shown, various measures of liquidity (e.g., total social financing, money supply, total loans from the financial sector) continue to rise without producing a rebound in real economic activity—another sign of "pushing on a string."

While the previous charts focused on the debt issue in China, I want to conclude this chapter by making the following clear: the debt issue is a big, important issue that could be a terrible burden for the Chinese economy as it was for the Japanese economy if Chinese policymakers don't handle it well—i.e., if the leaders don't engineer a beautiful deleveraging, which they have the ability to do because their debts are denominated in their own currency and most debtors and creditors are their own citizens.

However, I want to reiterate that there are important non-debt-burdened parts of the economy that are innovating and flourishing that will certainly be viable both in and out of China in the years to come and that Chinese assets are now very cheap. Chinese policymakers would be well-served to read the next chapter on the Japanese case and the lessons it provides, as would the rest of us.
