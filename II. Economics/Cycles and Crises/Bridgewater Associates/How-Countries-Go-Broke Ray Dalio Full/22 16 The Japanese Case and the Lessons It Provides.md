## THE JAPANESE CASE AND THE LESSONS IT PROVIDES

This chapter shows how a heavily indebted reserve currency country, Japan, handled its debts with reference to the earlier-described template. It shows the Big Debt Cycle transpiring in the very classic way, with the cause/effect relationships working as I described, but it is especially interesting because for more than two decades Japanese policymakers did the exact opposite of what should be done to execute a beautiful deleveraging—i.e., they did not restructure the debts for nine years and they didn't drive interest rates below inflation rates and nominal growth rates for 23 years. While this Japanese case study tells a very interesting story for those who are interested in seeing how the economic machine works, it does get a little technical. Those who don't want the technical details can skip them by just reading the highlights in bold, which will take only about 10 minutes.

Japan's story, like China's story, is a very interesting one that extends back to its Big Cycle prior to the one that began in 1945. To put Japan's history into the clear context of its Big Cycle, I will summarize what has happened since the beginning of the new world and domestic orders starting in 1945 and take a very brief look at what happened before 1945. I'm doing that because, as with China's story, Japan's story since 1945 would be greatly lacking in context if we didn't at least briefly touch on the Big Cycle dynamics of the 100 years before.

### BEFORE 1945

I will briefly recount Japan's history in the roughly 100 years prior to 1945. Besides using it to help you understand what has happened since then, be sure to observe how the classic Big Cycle of ups and downs repeated in that period before going on to observe how it continued from 1945 up until now.

In brief, like China, Japan had an elevated civilization that was happily isolated from the rest of the world until foreign powers came and demanded to "trade" with Japan and then threatened and exploited Japan. This led to a period in Japan similar to China's Century of Humiliation and the collapse of Japan's internal order, which affected the world order.

In Japan's case, it started with US Commodore Matthew Perry and his American fleet arriving in 1853 and led to the fall of Japan's 250-year-old domestic order under the Tokugawa family shogunate. Because the foreign powers clearly had greater powers than the Japanese, their obvious military superiority led to the collapse of the then-existing domestic order and then-existing monetary order, which were replaced by new ones. As the Japanese realized that the foreign, more modern approaches were better, the Japanese government was replaced by a new government in 1868, which largely copied the Western powers' approaches.

The new domestic order was a constitutional monarchy, which had a parliament and a new emperor (Meiji). That led to the modernization of Japan, which was achieved largely by following Western styles for education, the economy, and the military. (Puccini's magnificent *Madama Butterfly* plays out during this Meiji era.) These policies of reform and opening up led to Japan becoming a great power in a way similar to what happened in China when Deng

Xiaoping did a similar reform and opening up about a hundred years later. Under this new order, Japan fought and defeated its two rival regional powers—China in 1894-95 and Russia in 1904-05—and conquered and annexed Korea in 1910. During World War I, it allied itself with the British and took advantage of Germany's fighting in Europe to take over German territories in Asia, as well as some Chinese territories. At the end of World War I, since it was on the winning side, Japan was given formal control of the German territories and the Shandong province in China.

From 1912 to 1926, Japan's domestic order was a parliamentary democracy. But when economic problems began, the classic combination of a debt/economic crisis and the dysfunction of its democracy led to a collapse of public trust and a classic hard-right takeover, characterized by rising nationalism, militarism, and expansionism to secure economic resources and territory. In 1921, Japan's prime minister was assassinated by a young nationalist. After the crash of 1929, the nationalistic military seized control. To consolidate power, the new regime treated opponents as threats and used laws to silence leftists and democratic activists (e.g., the 1925 "Peace Preservation Law"). The Great Depression made the economic situation worse, and from 1937 to 1940, all political parties were dissolved, and there was increasing autocratic control that left the power exclusively in the hands of the military. In other words, events followed the classic script.

Geopolitically, this newly nationalistic and militaristic Japan invaded and took over China's Manchuria region (in 1931) and more of China (in 1937). Then it got into a conflict with the United States, which led the US to impose trade sanctions, similar to what's happening with the US-China conflict today. The US, the UK, and the Netherlands imposed export restrictions that hurt the Japanese economy and Japanese security by freezing Japanese assets and cutting off oil exports to Japan. This led to Japan attacking the US naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, which led to a war with the United States that Japan lost due to the United States secretly inventing a powerful technology that could be used for both peace and war—nuclear power. Because of Japan losing World War II, all Japanese money and debt were destroyed, and Japan was occupied and reconstructed by the United States from 1945 until 1952.

The following chart shows the total debt-to-GDP ratio going back to 1870. It shows both the Big Debt Cycle prior to 1945 and the one since. As you can see, there was the big run-up in debt in the 1930-45 period before and during the war, the debt wipeout that brought it down to low levels until 1970, the big debt bubble leading to the debt bust in 1989-90, and the rise in that ratio until recently. That is what the Big Debt Cycles have looked like since 1870. As is normal when looking at the Big Debt Cycles, the short-term debt and economic cycles are imperceptible.

JAPAN GENERAL GOVERNMENT DEBT LEVEL (\% GDP)

### SINCE 1945

In brief, from 1945 through 1990, Japan rebuilt itself to become the second-greatest economic power in the world and in the process built up a huge debt burden that funded a bubble that burst in 1989-90, which has had a huge weakening effect on Japan ever since. I will now look at the time from the debt bubble bursting until today because that is the most relevant period to understanding the part of the Big Debt Cycle that this study is focused on. The lessons that examining this part of the Big Debt Cycle provides in helping us understand other cases—most importantly the current cases in the United States, China, and Europe—are very valuable. Since I am focused on the deleveraging part of the Big Cycle, I won't cover the 1945-90 period and will focus on the post-1990 period.

### THE BIG DEBT CYCLE SINCE 1990

The Japanese government's handling of its debt problem from 1990 until 2013 exemplified exactly what not to do. It was the exact opposite of what I described should be done to execute a beautiful deleveraging, even though Japan had the capacity to execute a beautiful deleveraging because almost all of its debt was denominated in its local currency and almost all of the difficult debtor-creditor relationships were between Japanese parties, plus it was a net creditor to the rest of the world. More specifically, policymakers did not restructure their debts so the debt burdens lingered on bank and company balance sheets, making them "zombie institutions." They held to employment and cost policies that were rigid so that they couldn't effectively cut costs and adapt. They didn't make interest rates low in relation to both nominal growth rates and inflation. They did not meaningfully monetize their debts until after there was deflation and interest rates were near zero in 1995. For nearly two decades, the amount of fiscal and free-market policy adjustments and the amounts of monetary stimulus and debt purchases were woefully insufficient to engineer a beautiful deleveraging. As a result, until mid-2013, Japan had continuous deflation and economic stagnation as companies and people didn't have the previously described financial conditions to get this debt burden crisis behind them. The Japanese government did not deal with its non-performing-loan problem until 1999 (so for nine years after the debt bubble popped) when the government finally forced the banking system to restructure its debts and injected huge amounts of capital into the banks. It didn't monetize debt and bring interest rates significantly below nominal growth and inflation rates until 2013. Additionally, Japan's aging population was a headwind (e.g., in 1990,  $12\%$  of the population was over 65 and  $69\%$  of the population was working-age, while now  $29\%$  of the population is over 65 and only  $59\%$  is working-age).

Fiscal and monetary policies changed greatly and appropriately when Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda and Prime Minister Abe came to power in late 2012/early 2013 and initiated their "three arrows" policy to 1) increase the money supply, 2) boost central government spending, and 3) enact economic and regulatory reforms to make the Japanese economy more competitive, which, as previously described, are classically the best policies to negate deflationary, depressionary forces. As a result, from 2013 through 2019, there was no deflation and there was low positive growth (0.9\% per year) and the beginning of a healing period, though the deflationary and depressing psychological conditions lingered. The psychological overhang of 23 years of debt depression has had lasting negative effects on the strength and vibrancy that characterized Japan prior to 1990 and many times throughout history.

During this period, extremely large debt monetization and fiscal deficit stimulus (5\% of GDP deficits on average) and extremely large central bank buying of Japanese yen debt (the BoJ now holds government bonds worth more than 90\% of GDP) took place, which pushed interest rates 0.9\% below the nominal growth rate and 1\% below the inflation rate on average, and depreciated the yen, all of which were very stimulative. The combined lower interest rates and currency depreciation led to Japanese government bonds being a terrible storehold of wealth, losing 45\% relative to US bonds and 60\% relative to gold. These and other actions provided

An average interest rate that was about $2.2\%$ below the US rate and depreciated the currency by an average rate of $5.5\%$ per year in real terms versus the dollar. More specifically, the $-45\%$ cumulative return of a Japanese government bond versus a US government bond was almost entirely attributable to currency depreciation, since the lower carry/accrual from Japanese bonds was entirely offset by price gains (roughly $20\%$) due to falling Japanese yields. At the same time, Japanese inflation averaged only $1.1\%$ per year relative to US inflation of $2.7\%$ per year because of domestic deflationary pressures. The principle should resonate: don't own government bonds when there are extreme amounts of debt monetization.

Let's look at what happened more closely.

While there has been modest inflation of $0.8\%$ per year in average worker compensation in yen terms since 2013, the big yen depreciations—along with greater wage gains in other nations—made them more competitive. For example, there has been a total decline of $58\%$ in the cost of a Japanese worker relative to an American worker since 2013. Similarly, other domestic items in Japan have fallen a lot in cost relative to the costs in other countries. Both have helped to make Japan more competitive. These changes are shown in the following charts.

WAGES VS FX (INDEXED TO 2013)

Low interest rates reduced debt service costs a lot—since 2013, Japanese interest debt service has fallen over  \$50\%  (and has fallen over  \$65\%  since 2001), making it much easier to service the debt.

Still, the Japanese debt relative to the size of the economy has increased by almost  10\% . To neutralize its effects, the Bank of Japan bought over half of all the government debt and absorbed the debt service costs, which it monetized. The declines in interest rates engineered by the BoJ also contributed to the debt relief (though more of that benefit occurred even before Governor Kuroda took the helm, as short rates had already hit zero).

DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS AS A \% OF GOVT DEBT

Remarkably, the massive increase in debt that occurred in this period was concurrent with an improvement in Japan's central government balance sheet. Net assets (government assets minus government liabilities) are now  20\%  better in dollar terms compared to 2013 because the Bank of Japan accumulated dollar reserves (primarily in the 2001-12 period) and Japan's debts as measured in dollars are not up as much due to the yen depreciation.

Who were the winners and who were the losers? Clearly, the big losers were the Japanese debt holders, including the Japanese central bank. Japanese bond holders lost a total of $6\%$ in real terms (as real yields were generally negative), $45\%$ versus if they had instead held US bonds, and $60\%$ relative to the old "hard money" of gold. Next is a chart of the real return of just holding JGBs as a Japanese investor (in local currency) and their performance relative to US bonds and gold.

JAPAN 10YR BOND CUMULATIVE RETURNS

During this period, there was also a big deterioration in the BoJ's balance sheet. These losses will be very large if Japanese real and nominal bond yields rise to more reasonable levels (e.g., $2\%$ and $3\%$, respectively).

For example, if Japan were to have a $3\%$ rise in real interest rates (from $-0.3\%$ to 2.7\% ), then:

- The BoJ would experience about a $30\%$ of GDP mark-to-market loss on its bond holdings and would be in a seriously negative cash flow situation of around $-2.5\%$ of GDP.
- The government would see the deficit widen from roughly  $4\%$  of GDP to around  $8\%$  of GDP over the next 10 years due to the increase in interest costs (not including any outlays to cover central bank losses). The government debt level would surpass its post-WWII peak, rising from  $220\%$  to  $300\%$  over the next 20 years.

JAPAN GOVERNMENT DEFICIT (\% GDP)

- The combined cash flow need across the central bank and the central government would be around  $5 - 6\%$  of GDP per year, which is huge. That would have to be handled through debt issuance, money printing, and/or deficit reduction. If it were financed by central bank printing, this would be the equivalent of another round of QE in terms of expansion of the money stock, not including any additional printing needed to offset selling by the private sector.
- Resolving it would require even greater write-downs in debt and devaluations of the currency—with the Japanese people becoming relatively poorer in the process—until Japan is competitive enough to begin a new cycle.

Key non-tradable goods—local wages, local services, local housing—have seen essentially no price increases in yen terms and significant deflation in global currency terms since 2000. The affordability of rent (rent compared to wages) has barely moved. This is despite tradable goods and commodities being way up because of the currency's depreciation. And Japanese workers are more competitive than ever.

That said, Japan has seen dramatically lower dollar incomes, meaning purchases on imports are much more expensive. Using the most apples-to-apples comparison (dollar GDP per capita), individuals in Japan used to be richer than individuals in the US, and now they are some $60\%$ poorer. This is obvious to any Japanese person traveling abroad.

For a different angle of who the winners and losers were, it's helpful to take a look at how prices have changed in Japan at a very granular level because it provides a window into what it's like to earn, spend, and save there. The following table provides a lot of details, but to summarize:

- Since 2000, the yen is down \$30\% . If you were a US investor who kept their money in yen versus dollars earning the dollar interest rate, you'd be down \$84\% .
- Your returns for holding unhedged Japanese bonds versus US bonds were slightly better (but still very bad, down roughly $70\%$) and slightly better (but still very bad) for unhedged Japanese equities versus US equities (down around 67\% ).
- Meanwhile, prices in Japan (aggregate CPI) are up $10\%$ —much less than in the US, where prices are up $90\%$.
- At the same time, all fiat currencies have devalued versus goods. The dollar has depreciated about $50\%$ in the last 25 years.
- Whereas total average inflation is similar across major categories, the composition of inflation is very different. In Japan, there has been deflation in non-tradables—housing and labor especially—while prices of tradable goods (i.e., things you can purchase from abroad like electronics, toys, oil, etc.) have soared with some key tradable commodities up more than 3x in yen terms.
- Non-tradables are about flat in price while tradable commodities are up $2 - 10\mathrm{x}$ (3x on average).

JAPAN SPOT FX VS USD (IN MARKET CONVENTION)

- All of this is largely the inverse of what happened in the lead-up to the bubble (1980-90), when overheating growth and strong capital inflows led to both significant non-tradables inflation  ($+40\%$)  and yen strength  ($+70\%$) . These changes reflect the changes in the Big Cycle in Japan.

The following charts convey the picture for a Japanese worker. As shown, in the past 25 years, typical worker wages were relatively flat in yen terms, just shy of 400,000 yen a month, but fell significantly in dollar and world currency terms. In other words, while the average Japanese worker used to make the equivalent of \$3,500 a month, they now make about \$2,500. In gold terms, they used to earn 13 ounces of gold-equivalent a month; now it's 1 ounce.

For the Japanese people, the relevant question is how much of their labor it takes to afford what they purchase, and the fact that non-tradable essentials stayed affordable was important. The rent on a typical apartment—maybe the purest non-tradable—has stayed almost flat in hours-of-work terms, at 0.6 months of labor (though it's way less expensive in dollar terms).

You can also see the impact by looking at some real prices of items that mix commodities with heavy doses of domestic labor. The data on costs of vehicles tends to wiggle a lot, but roughly speaking a domestically made car used to cost eight months of labor, and now it's nine months. A convenience store boxed lunch used to take 10 minutes of work to afford, now it's 16 minutes (up more than 60\% ). Going to a theme park used to cost a third of a day of labor, now it's a half a day.

The charts reflect the dramatic changes that took place and are likely to continue to take place due to the previously described typical mechanical process of the Big Debt Cycle in which the country has a lot of debt denominated in its own currency and it is a reserve currency country.

Remarkably during this period, there were no really big internal or external conflicts, though Japan is now preparing for war with China (though it doesn't want it) as the United States' most important ally in the region.

### HOW DID JAPAN GET HERE?

I want to highlight five dynamics at play in Japan that helped bring about these sets of winners and losers. Here is what happened:

## 1. The government's deficit spending floods the private sector with cash, aiding in private sector deleveraging.
## 2. The central bank monetizes the debt to keep long rates low, lower debt service, and boost demand. The government's debt burden minus central bank holdings begins to fall as a percent of GDP.
## 3. The resulting currency depreciation acts as a sort of tax on foreign investors holding unhedged domestic bonds and domestic investors who didn't invest outside the country, while it lowers the government debt burden as that falls in value when measured in foreign FX and gold.

## 4. Domestic savers are similarly taxed, though to a lesser degree because, even though their buying power abroad decreases, that fall in buying power isn't as much domestically.
## 5. The country gets more competitive as both assets and factors of production get cheaper.

More specifically, it happened in the following way.

### Dynamic 1: Public sector deficit spending floods the private sector with cash, helping the private sector delever.

The following chart shows that dynamic, with public sector debt rising from roughly 1990 to 2020, during the period of private sector deleveraging. After that government leveraging, Japan was left with the highest government debt levels of any major country. There are many historical cases of other governments struggling to deal with their debt burdens. Japan was able to manage it because of the second dynamic.

Dynamic 2: The central bank monetizes the debt to keep long rates low, lower debt service, and boost demand. The government's debt burden minus central bank holdings begins to fall as a percent of GDP.

The following table shows how Japan's debt service (interest and principal repayment) in yen effectively fell by around $7\%$ during a period in which debts rose by nearly $30\%$. About half of that was because of lower interest rates (shown in the second chart) and debt being termed out. The other half was because of BoJ purchases of the debt.

DEBT MONETIZATION VS REAL YIELDS

Dynamic 3: The resulting currency depreciation acts as a sort of tax on foreign investors holding unhedged domestic bonds and lowers the government debt burden in foreign FX and gold.

BoJ actions significantly contributed to declines in the yen, as shown in this chart.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/3547bc27-1262-4e8f-ad60-d760e9f0a79a/57bd1b4baf3cc071f978230de7568c7822b40859dc3de0963d32b4c9b94fd69b.jpg)

This meant that holders of yen-denominated assets saw their holdings lose a significant amount of value. The following charts compare the returns of yen bonds to dollar bonds, and yen currency to USD currency. In both cases, yen holdings lost more than half of their value. This is not dissimilar to a default.

This also has produced a deleveraging of Japanese government debt as measured in other currencies. Measured in dollars, debt service is down since 2001, a period with rapid government borrowing. Measured in gold, debt levels are down some $80\%$.

Sub-components for each category are multiplicative, i.e., sum geometrically

Dynamic 4: Domestic savers are similarly taxed, though to a lesser degree because, even though their buying power abroad decreases, it's not as bad domestically.

We'll look at this point through two lenses:

- Holders of Japanese government debt without the currency exposure have done OK, even while the assets have done quite badly in dollar terms.

Asset valuations have mirrored this as well. Japan went from one of the more overvalued markets (at least as measured by imperfect statistics like P/Es) to inexpensive relative to the US.

### APPENDIX: JAPAN'S BIG DEBT CYCLE IN A FEW CHARTS

As with China, we'll end this chapter with charts that are more zoomed out, which helps show the Big Cycle transpiring over many decades.

The first chart shows Japan's Big Debt Cycle in the form of the government's debt-to-GDP ratio going back to 1900; that way you can see two Big Cycles, though we will focus on the second.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/3547bc27-1262-4e8f-ad60-d760e9f0a79a/7a425c4267b8b1de866f855353ca98b22c08c9f941c94bb72b2a44d5a77332cb.jpg)

GOVT DEBT (\% GDP)

The next chart shows the amount of central government debt service as a percent of the amount of revenue the government took in. In it, you can see the debt busts that happened when it exceeded $150\%$, and you can see how, in recent years, it has risen toward—but stayed below—$150\%$.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/3547bc27-1262-4e8f-ad60-d760e9f0a79a/2f3b0685f32c72a30947eb1f4bdff4b0ea41fc180b48ce6d9a4b256c8e0fa9d5.jpg)

JAPAN ESTIMATED GOVT DEBT SERVICE (\% REVENUE)

I will now shift to a post-1950 perspective. Through these charts, you can see how the last couple of decades are best characterized by "pushing on a string," with nominal rates falling below $0\%$, real rates a bit negative,[48] large amounts of money printing, and the yield curve just slightly upward-sloping. Corporate spreads have stayed low (for perspective, as of this writing, they are around $1\%$ in the US and $0.6\%$ in Japan for Baa-rated companies). All of these are characteristics of very stimulative monetary policy, especially in the last decade or so. Despite the stimulative policy, inflation has remained much lower than policymakers have generally desired, slipping in and out of deflation.

Highly stimulative policy comes with risks. So far, the BoJ has remained profitable: the bonds it's bought (with printed money) haven't seen big sell-offs, and the interest it's had to pay on excess reserves has remained quite low (because of low short-term interest rates). But if rates rise, the BoJ will become significantly unprofitable, fast. That recently happened to the Federal Reserve, producing moderate but manageable losses—up to $0.5\%$ of GDP. But with the BoJ's monetary base at around 5x the Fed's, losses could be much more meaningful.

### NOTE: MY FAILURE TO COVER A LOT

While it might seem like I covered a lot in this review of the period since 1945, what I left out was vastly greater than what I included. While I briefly looked at what happened in the United States, China, and Japan, I showed virtually nothing of what happened in the other developed powers (e.g., European powers) and Middle Eastern countries, and I barely mentioned most emerging countries, also known as the Global South (which includes many countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania). They all had and are having their Big Cycles. I am excited to say that with AI I am beginning to get my head around it all, and I have reason to believe that my digital self will evolve way beyond me to make sense of all these Big Cycles and communicate with you about them. (By the way, if you are interested in communicating with my digital self, you can receive updates on this AI initiative on my social media and by signing up at principles.com.)

Of the many countries I haven't been able to mention, it is worth taking a moment to look at rising countries with strong fundamentals (as reflected in my strength gauge that consists of 18 measures), like India, ASEAN countries (such as Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam), the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, which have benefited by being neutral vis-à-vis the power conflicts. A number of them are at take-off points in their developmental cycles because their people, governance systems, and capital markets are approaching being capable of competing in ways that they couldn't previously. Also, the conflicts between the United States and China are making the United States and China less desirable, which is driving capital, businesses, and talented individuals to these places. If you want to look at them more closely, I recommend that you look at my Country Power Index that summarizes the conditions and prospects of the top 24 countries. They are available for free at economicprinciples.org.
