# 26.18 My 3-Part Solution
## SOLUTION

This chapter is a quick and easy read for those who want to get the key points without spending too much time. It also provides thoughts and numbers that those who are analytical might want to spend some time pondering, so I recommend it for everyone.

I want to make this clear and easy to remember. If you keep in mind the number 3, that will help you remember that:

- The budget deficit should be cut to about  $3\%$ of GDP (from what it is currently projected to be by the CBO, about $6\%$ of GDP), and
- These cuts can come from 3 sources (spending cuts, tax increases, and interest rate cuts, with interest rate cuts being the most impactful).

If the president and those in Congress agree that they need to do that, and they agree on a bipartisan backstop approach to doing that (I will suggest an option), they will achieve the goal of greatly reducing the odds of the US government going broke.

That's it in a nutshell. I will now explain.

### THE PICTURE AS I SEE IT

It appears to me that:

## 1. Policy makers who are working on getting the debt issue under control (some have given up on the idea) are approaching the problem from the bottom up, by which I mean by working on which spending cuts and/or which tax increases are better than others, rather than working from the top down, by which I mean by looking at how much it will take in total to meet the goal, then looking at the three big levers that government policy makers can pull to reduce the deficit (i.e., spending cuts, tax increases, and interest rate reductions), and finally deciding which spending cuts, which tax increases, and which interest rate changes to make.
## 2. Policy makers are so tied up in arguing about the particulars in order to get exactly what they want that they have made the likelihood of a disastrous outcome—either not limiting the debt or having a bad government shutdown—much greater than the likelihood of an attainable good outcome.

To tackle this problem, I believe that they should 1) work from the top down, by which I mean agree on the size of the cuts to the deficit and the size of the deficit as a percentage of GDP that need to be made to stabilize the debt and 2) agree on a fallback plan that achieves the necessary budget cuts that would automatically happen if they can't reach agreement on the particulars. This fallback plan could be something like equal percentage cuts to all spending that can be cut and equal percentage increases on all taxes that can be increased so that combined they will achieve the goal if they can't agree on anything else, so they will be assured of having a deal. Then, they can go on and try to create a plan that they can agree is better than that one. I will now propose a fallback plan that policymakers should be able to agree on.

### WHAT MY $3 \%$  3-PART SOLUTION LOOKS LIKE

The following chart shows the US debt level as a percentage of government revenue. The current debt trajectory is shown with the blue dashed line, and based on how I understand the mechanics to work and on indicators of what is most likely to happen, it appears to me that to prevent the central government from going broke, policymakers have to change the government debt level trajectory to the green dashed line. Changing that trajectory will require some cut in spending, and/or some increase in tax revenue, and/or some cut in the interest rate on the debt such that these three moves in total will add up to cutting the deficit down to  $3\%$  of GDP. Such a deficit cut would lead to the debt burden being about  $17\%$  lower in 10 years than it would be if the US were to continue on its currently projected path (which amounts to debts being  $9$  trillion lower in 10 years). In 20 years, my  $3\%$  3-part solution would make government debt  $31\%$  lower, which is  $26$  trillion lower. Doing that would greatly reduce the risks of the central government, those who are lending to it, and all those who would also be affected by a big debt issue from suffering a "heart attack."

USA CENTRAL GOVT DEBT LEVEL (\% GOVT REVENUE)

There are three main types of levers that can be pulled to control the deficit, and in Chapter 3 I showed tables that conveyed the effects of pulling them. To achieve the goal of stabilizing debt relative to income, it would take about an  $11\%$  increase in taxes, about a  $12\%$  cut in spending, or about a  $3\%$  cut in interest rates, all else equal, if just one lever were used alone. Of course, any one of these numbers alone is way too large, so managing the adjustment will require a good combination of two or three of them.

Let's look more closely at those numbers, which are interesting because they show how much more powerful a change in interest rates would be than a change in taxation. For instance, interest rates falling by $1\%$ is about four times more effective at reducing the debt-to-income ratio over the next 20 years than a $1\%$ increase in tax revenue. The numbers also show how much more powerful a change in taxation would be than a change in spending—a $1\%$ increase in tax revenue is $1.2x$ more effective than a $1\%$ reduction in spending over the same 20-year time frame. But these estimates of the direct effects understate what the total effects are likely to be after accounting for the likely secondary effects. More specifically, a cut in interest rates is even more powerful than the estimate I gave you because, besides lowering government debt service payments, interest rate cuts would boost asset prices, which would raise capital gains tax receipts and be stimulative to the economy, and raise inflation, which would raise tax revenues. It's also worth noting that 1) the second-order effects of cutting spending would be negative for economic activity and thus negative for income taxes and 2) the second-order effects of raising taxes would also be negative because of the reduction in spending and economic growth.

In other words, there are two important takeaways. First, the biggest influence on the government's deficit is ironically not Congress, which determines spending and taxes—it is the Federal Reserve, which determines interest rates. Second, while trimming the budget deficit and cutting interest rates each reduces the debt problem, they would have offsetting effects on economic growth, inflation, and taxes. This means that if these actions are balanced well, the budget deficit can be reduced significantly without creating unacceptable effects on the economy.

Given that, if I were deciding for the president and/or Congress, I would want the Federal Reserve to lower the interest rate. I expect that the president and Congress will pressure the Fed to do that, but, of course, Congress and the president don't determine what the Fed does. If I were on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, I would be willing to work with the president and Congress to implement such a plan because a fiscal tightening (which would have the first-order effects of reducing the deficit and being negative for economic growth and inflation) in conjunction with a monetary easing (which would also be deficit-reducing while being positive for economic growth and inflation) looks like a great plan. It is obvious that a fiscal tightening with a monetary easing would be a good thing. In fact, if Congress and the president enacted a significant deficit reduction, it would trigger a rally in bonds and a decline in interest rates that would help reduce the deficit. Some people worry about a cut in the fiscal deficit of that size being too negative on the economy, but that's not my worry because if the fiscal tightening were too negative on growth and inflation, it would trigger a monetary easing to rectify that. So, what's the problem with cutting spending and raising taxes other than the political problem of anger from those who are getting less money from spending or who are paying more in taxes? I don't see it.

A fiscal tightening with a monetary easing makes financial and economic sense because the biggest imbalance that now exists that should be rectified is between the central government's finances (it has dangerously too much debt and too much borrowing) and the private sector's finances (which are in relatively good shape, particularly in the booming areas of the market and the economy). This state of affairs came about because the Fed helped to fund the large budget deficits that allowed the big spending and the central government's debt problem to happen in the first place. So, the Fed cooperating to negate whatever pain that might come as a result of a large (3\% of GDP) deficit cut would make sense, especially since the private sector has received lots of deficit-funded support, is now in pretty good shape, and could use some fiscal tightening, which the Fed could help manage with its monetary policy. It would bring private and public sector finances into better balance.

Who would suffer from the lower interest rate? While bond holders will get a lower real yield, they would benefit from interest rates falling because bond prices would go up, plus they would get a safer bond. The world would celebrate such an accomplishment, both because of the reduced US government debt risk and because it would demonstrate that the American political system can work well to solve at least this big problem. Also, other major markets like equities would benefit from those changes. So, just about everyone other than special interest groups should like the immediate effects of this plan.

Let's now play around with the numbers and these three levers to see what specific changes could get the $3\%$ of GDP deficit goal achieved by making the adjustments come roughly equally from spending cuts, taxes, and interest rate cuts. That would take about a $4\%$ cut in spending, a $4\%$ increase in taxes, and a $1\%$ cut in real interest rates. That way, policymakers would spread out where they get the $3\%$ of GDP from so it's not too big for anyone, it's pretty politically agnostic, and the depressing fiscal effects would be offset by the stimulative monetary effects of the real interest rate cuts. That would be my solution to the problem with one possible modification: because those amounts of cuts in spending and increases in taxes would cause abrupt changes, I would phase these changes in over three years. As mentioned, I would try to make that a bipartisan fallback position to use if no other solution is reached because everyone would be relieved if policymakers could agree on an acceptable plan and negotiate the tweaks to it.

### WHAT IF THE FED DOESN'T GO ALONG WITH THIS?

Of course, the Fed can't openly say that it will go along with this plan (though deals between the Fed keeping interest rates low while the government was cutting the deficit have been made in the past), so let's look at the possibility that Congress and the President will have to make the changes come only from spending cuts and raising tax revenue by the same percentages. That percentage would be about $6\%$ (i.e., cutting spending by $6\%$ and raising taxes by $6$), which would also equal about a $3\%$ of GDP deficit reduction. While those amounts of adjustments would be large by historical standards, I know that they can occur without problems if balanced well, and I know that if they are too depressing to economic growth, the Fed will respond by lowering interest rates because that's what the central bank does when the economy and inflation are too depressed. For these reasons, I know that if this $3\%$ 3-part plan is followed, it would be worlds better than if it is not followed.

### MY PROPOSED DEFICIT CUT COMPARED WITH PAST DEFICIT CUTS

While many will say that these changes are draconian, my study of past deficit cuts leads me to believe that they are very manageable if monetary policy is managed sensibly at the same time. Phasing in my plan and assuming the Fed will run monetary policy sensibly would lead to the adjustment looking something like what is shown in the blue dashed line, which is very close to the original $3\%$  plan (green line).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/3547bc27-1262-4e8f-ad60-d760e9f0a79a/2b58e28778992c691edcc7efb8d058f7ffd643f45a55d8d406f4b48f58452f40.jpg)

USA CENTRAL GOVT DEBT LEVEL (\% GOVT REVENUE)

However, I need to point out a fly in the ointment. As mentioned, the numbers I showed are based on the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office's numbers. These numbers are based on the existing plan for the 2017 Trump tax cuts to roll off, so if they are extended as President Trump has promised to do, the deficit will be larger by an estimated $1.5\%$ of GDP, so the deficit cut will have to be over $4\%$ of GDP rather than about $3\%$ to stabilize government debt-to-income.

While such a budget deficit cut is large, it's not very large by historical standards. The following table lists all major fiscal policy tightenings in all countries going back to 1960. It shows that big fiscal tightenings (3\% of GDP or even much larger) went well if put into place when 1) growth was strong, 2) the monetary/currency policy was easy, and 3) debts were in currencies that the central bank could print. Notably, the fiscal tightening in these cases helped to lower bond yields, which reduced interest costs on the debt and encouraged private sector activity that raised taxes, and to the extent the fiscal tightening weakened the economy more than desired, it led to monetary easings that negated the fiscal tightening effects on the economy. The most successful US case of cutting the budget deficit happened in the 1993-98 period, which took the deficit from 4\% of GDP to a surplus of 1\% of GDP (a 5\% of GDP improvement) over those years, which would be like cutting the deficit by 1.5 trillion today. My plan would cut the deficit by much less than that amount.

My timeless and universal principle about this is:

- When there are large government debts that are growing quickly so that large cuts to budget deficits are needed, the most important things to do are to 1) cut the deficit by enough to rectify the problem, 2) cut the deficit when economic conditions are good so the cuts are counter-cyclical, and 3) have monetary policy be stimulative enough to keep the economy strong in the face of such cuts.

### MORE SPECIFICALLY, WHICH EXPENSES SHOULD BE CUT AND WHICH TAXES SHOULD BE RAISED?

While I am tempted to get into what I believe are the relative merits of the different specific types of spending cuts, tax increases, and interest rate cuts, I'm not going to do that because I don't think there is any reason that my preferences should matter.[52] It also would be too big of a digression and would lead to all sorts of arguing with all sorts of people who have different preferences. The problem of all sorts of people having all sorts of preferences that they will fight for and not being able to resolve their disagreements is to me the biggest problem that we face—i.e., as a country and a civilization—which is that there is so much arguing over the exact ways to prevent the disaster that it won't be prevented. That's why I am recommending the equal and proportionate cut in spending and increase in taxes as the fallback plan if no other plan can happen. Then, once that is in place, as has been proposed in the past, policymakers could authorize a bipartisan fiscal commission to examine the debt issue and propose specific alternatives that are preferable to the fallback plan. But frankly, I don't care exactly how congressional policymakers do it nearly as much as I care that they do it.

Nonetheless, let's look at the constraints that must be considered.

A selection of highly impactful potential spending cuts and tax increases and their impacts are shown in the following table. This list of items came primarily from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office, which most policymakers refer to. Looking at that list tells me that tweaking existing spending programs and taxes in moderate, tolerable ways could achieve the $3\%$ of GDP deficit goal without unacceptable pain. This list also shows the revenue that can be brought in by tariffs (which during many periods of history have been a greater source of government revenue than anything else). According to the CBO,  $10\%$  tariffs on all imports could bring in about  $0.6\%$  of GDP. Also, if Elon Musk's claim that he can cut the budget deficit by  \$2 trillion is half true (i.e., if DOGE can cut the budget deficit by\$ 1 trillion), that would be  $3\%$  of GDP. There are several other radical changes and considerations on the table, so I'm confident that one way or another, policymakers can do it, and I like some of the aspirations as I'm all in favor of radically improving the efficiency of the government and the economy. So, it's not hard for me to imagine how a pragmatic "grand bargain" between reasonable Republicans and Democrats could be reached. My only question is whether the people involved will operate together logically to do sensible things.

Now is the time for policymakers to put up or shut up. To be clear, whatever form of grand bargain cuts the deficit to about  $3\%$  of GDP is good with me. That leads me to conclude that if our representatives in Washington don't get a debt limit deal done, it will be because of their lack of reasonableness and their inability to compromise—not because a good and workable plan is beyond their reach. Because the failure to reach an agreement will produce a much bigger problem than reaching an agreement along the lines of my  $3\%$  solution, it seems to me that the electorate should hold their representatives in Congress accountable to get a debt limit deal done.

In the following table are some of the choices and their effects on the budget deficit, which were put out for informational purposes mostly by the Congressional Budget Office. I am sharing them simply to convey a picture of the alternatives.

In considering which spending to cut, when one looks at the possibilities, one quickly notices that about $70\%$ of the non-interest spending is considered "mandatory"—i.e., it is either contractually required or politically nearly impossible to cut. The breakdown is shown in the following chart.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/3547bc27-1262-4e8f-ad60-d760e9f0a79a/91fd83686df6ff77a92a6a63ef04cc960c6af080adac47f387bf7123b3b7058e.jpg)

That said, in the "mandatory" spending part of the budget, there are a number of relatively modest changes that could have big impacts. For instance, two changes to Social Security (phasing in an increase to the retirement age from 67 to 70 and using a more realistic inflation measure to calculate the increase in benefits), which wouldn't affect virtually anyone immediately, would produce about a tenth of the required spending cuts.

The roughly  $30\%$  of spending that is "discretionary" that Congress has to reauthorize every year (which is shrinking fast as a share of spending because entitlement programs are growing) includes defense spending (which is almost half of the discretionary budget), medical care for veterans, rental assistance for low-income households, funding for transportation, medical and scientific research, education transfers to states, and hundreds of other functions of the government. Because a bill needs to be passed every year to authorize this spending, these are the easiest to cut (though they have not been cut). If you cut just from these "discretionary" items to achieve the goal of cutting spending by about  $4\%$ , that would require  $15\%$  cuts in these on average. I find the distinction between discretionary and non-discretionary spending to be a bit arbitrary because cuts can be made to both. The important thing is getting to a reasonable mix that adds up to a deficit reduction of  $3\%$  of GDP to get the deficit down to  $3\%$  of GDP.

### DO IT NOW! DO IT COUNTER-CYCLICALLY!

To re-emphasize: When there are large government debts that are growing quickly so that large cuts to budget deficits are needed, the most important things to do are to 1) cut the deficit by enough to rectify the problem, 2) cut the deficit when economic conditions are good so the cuts are counter-cyclical, and 3) have monetary policy be stimulative enough to keep the economy strong.

Now is an exceptionally good time to implement a significant debt limit plan because:

- It is much better to reduce government deficits in good economic times than to wait for a debt crisis to happen in bad times.
- The US economy is near full employment, growth is moderately strong, inflation is a bit high, and the private sector's income statements and balance sheets are in pretty good shape (mostly because the government took on the burden, though it should probably shift at least some of it back).
- If the plan is not implemented now, the debt problem will grow and be more difficult to deal with. That is especially true because the debt cycle is now at the stage in which more borrowing and more debt are needed to service existing debts, so they are increasing in a self-reinforcing and compounding way.

Implementing this plan now would be a confidence booster that would have all sorts of beneficial knock-on effects. It's also worth noting that there are other, less commonly discussed ideas out there that could have a big impact on the debt picture. I'm in favor of marking the government's assets to market, creating a US government sovereign wealth fund, and exploring a US-backed stablecoin if these things can be done well. Imagine if the government's assets were managed economically—i.e., if they were valued, bought, sold, and/or developed economically rather than not even looked at economically, as is the case now—and imagine there was a well-funded, well-run sovereign wealth fund behind the government's financing and debt. That's an interesting subject for another time.

In concluding this chapter, I want to reiterate that even with the best of budget plans, there are very big uncertainties that can throw them off. For example, we don't know if there will be wars that will cost more and worsen the budget deficits, or if there will be bigger-than-expected productivity gains from new technologies that will produce higher incomes and tax revenues that will reduce budget deficits. There are many such uncertainties that will undoubtedly disrupt these projections, so the ranges of possibilities around them are large. To me, that suggests that US policymakers should be more, not less, conservative in dealing with the government's finances because the worst thing possible would be to have its finances in bad shape during difficult times.

### APPENDIX: LOOKING IN MORE DETAIL AT THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT SPENDING, TAX, AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON THE DEFICIT IN THE US

Achieving the goal of stabilizing government debts relative to government revenues is kind of like playing with a Rubik's Cube, in that changing one lever changes the impact of all the others. The following tables show how different combinations of government spending cuts, tax increases, and interest rate changes would lead to different outcomes for the government's debt-to-income ratio.

The first table shows the status quo—what the US government debt picture looks like in 20 years if there are no changes in revenue, spending, or real interest rates from those now projected by the Congressional Budget Office. In that baseline scenario, US government debt will reach over $130\%$ of GDP in 20 years. However, it's important when doing these calculations to compare debt levels to tax revenue, not nominal GDP. GDP is often used by default, but that can be misleading because levels and changes in tax revenue can be very different from levels and changes in GDP. When dealing with government finances, what matters are the revenues and expenses of the government. Translating this projection into a share of government revenue, the US is projected to reach debt that is $7.2\mathrm{x}$ of  government income, up from about $5.8\mathrm{x}$ right now.

To give you a sense of how the different pieces interact, I also show in this table how this projection would change as the government changes its spending (x-axis, with spending declining as you move to the right) and/or revenues (y-axis, with taxes rising as you move down). This shows how challenging it is to stabilize the debt if lower real rates are not part of the solution—it requires relatively large cuts in spending and increases in revenue.

Finally, I show how much of each lever you'd need to pull on its own. For instance, just cutting discretionary spending would require nearly $50\%$ cuts to those programs, while just cutting interest rates on the government debt would require them to fall by around $3\%$. That's why I like my $3\%$ 3-part solution—because it spreads the adjustments across the levers.
