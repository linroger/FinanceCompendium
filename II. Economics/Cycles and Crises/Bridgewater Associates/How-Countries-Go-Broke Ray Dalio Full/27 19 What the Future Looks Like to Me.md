# What the Future Looks Like to Me
## WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE TO ME

In this chapter, I try to look into the future using my measures of where things now stand and my principles about how changes occur, which are based on what I think are the most important cause/effect relationships. I expect that you will find this chapter very controversial, very interesting, and very valuable.

"He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass."

is an adage I learned early in my investment career. It has stuck with me ever since because it has repeatedly proven

true. I know that whatever success I have had has been more due to my knowing how to deal with what I don't know than with anything I do know. So I will begin by explaining a bit about how I bet on the future."

### BETTING ON THE FUTURE

From very early on in my investment career, I based my decision-making approach on seeing the cause/effect relationships that drive what happens in markets and economies. I saw how the cause/ effect relationships that I identified interacted with everything to drive how all things happen as a sort of perpetual motion machine that drives developments over time. Seeing how this perpetual motion machine has driven everything that has happened led me to believe that everything (other than the quantum world) is predestined and that if we had a perfect model that took every cause/effect relationship into consideration, we could almost perfectly forecast the future. I believe that the only thing standing in the way of that perfect forecasting is our ability to understand and model all those cause/effect dynamics—and that we will get much closer to achieving this with AI.

Most people don't see things that way. They believe the future is unknowable and that destiny doesn't exist. I am confident that this view is by and large wrong now, and I believe that it will quickly become even more apparent that it is wrong to those who seek, obtain, and use the understandings that are increasingly available to us. In my own career, I found success by building AI expert decision-making systems to describe these cause/effect dynamics; in the future, the way that I—and I presume others—will model things will be through more advanced forms of AI such as generative AI and explainable AI.

To be clear, while having a perfect model that gives a nearly perfect picture of what the predestined future looks like would be great, I don't expect that my model will come close to that, so my goal is simply to have a crude, quickly evolving model that gives me a leg up relative to the competition and relative to the position I would be in if I didn't have the model. I have found that this works well because, though forecasting exactly, or even nearly exactly, is now impossible because there are too many determinants that are themselves highly uncertain and together determine what happens, there are many things about the future—such as death, taxes, the life cycles of individuals, demographic shifts, the effects that people's DNA and environments have on them, and untold other cause/effect relationships—that are relatively knowable and good indicators of roughly what will happen. I especially look for big, unsustainable conditions and I position myself to bet that they won't be sustained.

I play my betting/investing game by knowing as much as possible about the timeless and universal cause/effect relationships of these relatively knowable things, and I build this understanding into templates/models of how things are likely to unfold.

Because the causes come before their effects, if I know the cause/effect relationships better than my competitors, I can anticipate what will happen better than they can and, as a result, do very well in the investment game. I have found great value in building this approach into market-positioning systems that have been back-tested and can be used in an investment game plan that I execute. I constantly compare how conditions are evolving and how my bets are performing relative to my expectations. If the results are inconsistent with my expectations, I diagnose why and improve my decision-making systems. The computerized expert systems I use are designed to make decisions like I would, just better than I could because they can simultaneously and quickly process a lot more than my brain can.[53]

While I've done very well as a global macro investor betting on the future in this unique way, I am wrong a lot (at least one-third of the time relative to what the markets are expecting) and I am never exactly right. Because I know that it takes only one really bad bet or a series of moderately bad bets to knock me out of the game, I am extremely risk-averse, so I have built great risk controls. I control risks through diversification of my good risky bets rather than by avoiding risky bets. To me, the "Holy Grail of Investing" is to find and make 15 or more great uncorrelated bets.

I have followed this approach for about 35 of my 50-plus years as a professional investor. I am as hooked on playing this game as I have ever been, though now I want to pass along what I've learned rather than keep it to myself. It is of course up to others to decide whether what I'm sharing is of value, but I know that from my own experience.

It is. I have made a lot of money betting on the cause/effect relationships I described earlier in this book—relationships between the short-term and long-term debt and political cycles, acts of nature, and humanity's inventiveness creating new technologies. These relationships are also logical and have appeared across thousands of years of history. I am sure that they are the biggest and most important forces, even though there are still a lot of key unknowns and uncertainties.

Now that I have that explanation out of the way, I will tell you what I conjecture about the future. Please remember that I use my template to see things differently than most people and that I am especially drawn to situations that I assess to be more likely to happen than most people think. This means the outcomes I am anticipating are not reflected in the price, so they are good things to bet on. Also, keep in mind that I am not fully sure of anything, except death and taxes.

### LOOKING AHEAD USING MY TEMPLATE AND MY INDICATORS

You now know how I believe monetary orders, domestic political governance orders, and international orders evolve, break down, and transition driven by the five big forces I've outlined earlier and won't repeat here. I use my Big Cycle template and my indicators to show me where we are in these cycles and anticipate what will happen, and to make investments, I convert this conceptual template into a much more specific analytical decision-making system. I will use these concepts to convey where I think things stand and what I expect.

```

I will start with my big-picture summary of how I see things as of my writing in March 2025:

## 1. The US and the existing world order are about 80 years into, which is about $90 - 95\%$ through, the Big Cycle that began in 1945. The Big Cycle is like the human life cycle.

In that it progresses through relatively knowable stages, and while knowing about this cycle won't tell you exactly what will happen, it will tell you a lot about what is likely to happen and roughly when. I broke this Big Cycle up into the six stages that I described in Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order and touched on in this book. By my measures, the Big Cycle is in Stage 5, which is on the brink of great conflicts and seismic shifts.

## 2. The US and other major economies are about five years into, which by my measures is about two-thirds through, the 13th short-term debt/economic cycle of the post-1945 era. As explained, this short-term debt/economic cycle interacts with domestic political and international geopolitical cycles, acts of nature developments, and new inventions to drive the shorter-term cycle swings that typically take about six years, give or take about three years. While knowing about this short-term cycle won't tell you exactly what will happen and when, it will tell you a lot about what is likely to happen and roughly when.

## 3. There are some big, unsustainable imbalances that make good bets because they likely won't be sustained—most importantly, it is a good bet that the amount of borrowing and buying and piling up of debt assets and liabilities being faster than income growth won't be sustained.
## 4. We are at the maximum point of not knowing what actions will be taken and what effects they will have because the new leadership in the US has only been in power for a few weeks and President Trump seems to be more inclined to do previously unimaginable things than any president in the last 80 years—and perhaps any president ever.

By my measures, the current configuration of conditions is most analogous with those that existed in 1905-14 and 1933-38 and many prior times in many countries throughout history, which, as

Just noted, is what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle. During Stage 5, countries are overindebted, inefficiently run, divided, and threatened by other countries, so there is a strong tendency for leaders with populist, nationalistic, protectionist, militaristic, and autocratic approaches to emerge.

By studying history, we can see that such challenging times have always led to much more autocratic governance because democracies become too divisive to be effective, and their leaders lose their abilities to compromise effectively. At these times, only power matters, so those who get it and become the more autocratic leaders in positions of power tend to be more inclined to engage in conflict, not cooperation, with both their internal and their external opponents. The new leaders always vow to fight to improve national strength and are more willing to engage in economic, geopolitical, and military conflicts, which bring them to the brink of major conflicts and big changes in the monetary order, the domestic political order, and the world geopolitical order.

By my measures, this is where all of the major powers now are—i.e., they are overindebted, inefficiently run, and divided—and it is this configuration of conditions that is increasingly leading to the emergence of more nationalistic, protectionist, militaristic, and autocratic leaders and policies. These leaders, especially President Trump in the US, want to fight to improve national strength and are more willing to engage in economic, geopolitical, and military conflicts to win. Recent events are by and large following the classic Big Cycle template that I have laid out and that has brought the world to the brink of great conflicts and big changes. To be clear, these changes don't have to be bad ones because what they will be like is still in the hands of those who control the levers of power.

Let's now look a bit more closely at each of the five forces and what's happening with them, using as a guide some of the principles I shared earlier in this book. I will focus mostly on the United

States because it is the most important country by most measures, and its changes will have the biggest effects on what will happen to the world, though the other G7 countries and China all are in similar positions and intertwined in this Big Cycle, and all countries will be affected by them, while also affecting what happens. It's also worth noting that, along with all of what you read from here, there is the demographic force to reckon with. This will lead to a lot of older people who won't be working and will be expensive to support (because of healthcare costs) at the same time that the workforce will be shrinking, so that only a small percentage of people will be truly productive.

## 1. The Debt/Money Force

Regarding where we are in the Big Debt Cycle, as shown earlier in this book, by my measures the US and most major countries (the other G7 countries and China) are overindebted, in the late stages of their Big Debt Cycles, and have to frequently rely on Monetary Policy 3 (i.e., big fiscal deficits that are funded by central banks buying the debt). As a result, if their long-term Big Debt Cycle issues are not controlled in some way, the probability of an unwanted major restructuring/monetization of debt assets and debt liabilities that are denominated in the major reserve currencies happening is very high—something like $65\%$ over the next five years and something like $80\%$ over the next 10 years. This is because the debt assets and debt liabilities are already very large, and they are projected to rise to significantly higher levels that will make it increasingly difficult to have interest rates high enough and money tight enough to satisfy the lender-creditors without having interest rates so high and money so tight that they will hurt the borrower-debtors. The following charts show the average total debt and debt service as a percent of GDP going back to 1900 across the G7 countries.

As described earlier, the next big red flag to watch out for that would signal that a debt crisis is about to happen is significant selling of government debt assets (e.g., bonds) by existing holders of them. This would come together with the issuing and sales of new government debt to create a huge supply relative to the demand, which would put central banks in the position of having to choose between letting nominal and real interest rates rise a lot or printing a lot of money and buying long-term government debt to keep these interest rates down, thus devaluing debt and money. It seems to me that now is a good time to remember the following principle:

During times when there is too much debt relative to the quantity of money that is needed to service debts, the need to either increase the amount of money that exists and/or cut the amount of debt there is leads governments to break their promises and do some combination of a) raising the amount of money and credit, b) reducing the amount of debt (e.g., by restructuring it), and/or c) preventing the free-market ownership and movement of the hard money (e.g., gold). At such times, there is a run away from bad money to good money that the government wants to stop. This often leads to prohibiting good money from being freely held and freely moved.

Clearly, it is in these countries' interests to not have such large debt burdens. As I have seen by studying history, when countries were in analogous positions, they reduced their debt burdens using various, seemingly extreme ways that were then, and would be now, considered unimaginable. These extreme actions have included freezing debt payments, seizing assets of adversary nations, imposing confiscatory taxes and capital/foreign exchange controls, defaulting on debts/extending maturities, and changing the type of money in circulation (by de-linking it from a hard asset like gold or creating a new type of money).

I'm not saying it's certain that these things will happen, but I do want to point out that these kinds of radical changes were made by much more conventional leaders than Donald Trump, like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard Nixon. While at this time I consider most of these to be more unlikely possibilities than high probabilities, there is no doubt in my mind that, one way or another, leaders must manage the debt supply-and-demand issue well. It is important to be aware of the risks these extreme actions present and stay tuned as things change. In my opinion, my $3\%$ 3-part solution in conjunction with a well-coordinated "beautiful deleveraging" in which the deflationary ways of deleveraging (e.g., fiscal tightening and debt restructuring) are balanced with the inflationary ways of deleveraging (e.g., the easing of monetary policy and debt monetization) would be best. In any case, the days of borrowing much more than can be paid back to support excess consumption by unproductive people are coming to an end. Going forward, the primary goals will be to simultaneously increase productivity and diminish the burden of the debt (which will also diminish the value of the debt and money).

As mentioned above, the US and most major countries are probably now about two-thirds into their short-term cycles. This puts them close to their equilibrium levels, judging by real and nominal economic growth, interest rates, and inflation rates. The monetary tightening that began in March 2022 ended the last paradigm in which the US Fed and other G7 central banks gave away lots of money and credit for free. Starting in or around March 2022, the Fed and most other central banks shifted from a) monetary policies that were great for borrower-debtors and bad for lender-creditors and inflationary to b) monetary policies that were slightly tight (by my measures). As a result of this tightening and supply chain problems lessening, inflation rates declined to levels that are now modestly above their stated targets, which has led these central banks to gradually ease. Most countries are now in a new paradigm in which central banks are having a relatively neutral monetary policy with relatively moderate conditions, depending on the country (e.g., economic growth is stronger in the US, particularly in the tech sector, and weaker in other G7 countries), though the UK, France, and some developing countries like Brazil are encountering the sort of government debt supply-and-demand problems that I described earlier in this book. By and large, nominal and real interest rates now appear about right—i.e., high enough to be acceptable for lender-creditors without being so high that they are too problematic for borrower-debtors—judging by inflation and growth rates alone. But they are not high enough (by my measures) given the fiscal supply-and-demand dynamic explained in this book.

Additionally, this is all impacting different companies in different sectors very differently—in fact, more so than at any time I can remember—because of the disruptive changes that are underway. The main reason that debt service didn't rise to new highs while debts increased over the last few decades is that interest rates went down from 1980-81 until the recent rise. Since actual debt service payment changes lag interest rate changes (because interest rates on fixed-rate debt don't rise until the debts mature), we should expect debt service payments to continue to rise to catch up with current interest rates. Based on inflation and growth readings as of this writing in March 2025, a Fed easing is not appropriate now. That begs the question of how the Fed, which is essentially the central banker for the world, is going to run a monetary policy that works for most everyone. I think that is a virtually impossible job that will subject the Fed to much more criticism and interference. Given the circumstances and the history of what happens with central banks at such times, the independence of the central bank should not be taken for granted.

This most recent short-term debt cycle tightening was a bit different.

From other historical examples in two ways. First, because there was an engineered big shift in wealth to the private sector from the government sector (which is now carrying a lot of the debt and borrowing a lot to support the private sector), the private sector is currently in pretty good financial shape while the government sector is having financial problems, as previously described. In most developed economies, most importantly in the three major reserve currency economies—the US, the Eurozone, and Japan—the central governments have been and are still borrowing a lot to make distributions to households, and this is hurting these governments' finances and threatening them in the ways described throughout this study. Said differently, in recent years central government and central bank income statements and balance sheets deteriorated so that household and corporate income statements and balance sheets would improve. This has created a safer environment for the private sector because central governments and central banks don't have to worry about their debt problems as much, don't get squeezed for money as much, and don't have to worry about market losses as much.

The second thing that makes this short-term debt cycle less typical is that the picture of the private sector is one of abnormally large divergences between companies. The tightening that began in 2022 hurt some sectors much more severely than other sectors, and technological, political, and geopolitical changes created big divergences. More specifically, in the most recent short-term debt cycle tightening, the overlevered, cash-short, interest-rate-sensitive, and/or bubble companies and investors who invested in them were hurt while the cash-flush, interest-rate-insensitive, financially sound, and/or hot-tech-related companies and their investors did great. Also, even with the wealth transfer from the government sector to the private sector, wealth gaps have continued to increase, with the relatively uneducated bottom  $60\%$  of the population in bad shape while the top  $1\%$  (about 3 million people) who are amazingly well-educated and productive contributors to the boom areas are being tremendously rewarded in their jobs and in the investments that they own. This is most obviously exemplified in the large number of unicorn companies that are coming up with amazing new things that are enhancing productivity and producing billionaires (on paper) at a fast pace.

By my measures, there is a significant risk that both a debt squeeze and an economic downturn will simultaneously happen two or three years from now.

### WHAT ABOUT THE MARKETS?

In looking at the markets, it is helpful to start with the following principle:

There is always a current, most popular meme that just about everyone believes. It is reflected in the price and is bound to be wrong in some way. These memes typically are due to a mix of extrapolating what happened before and emotional considerations. Also, most investors typically don't take into consideration market pricing. In other words, they tend to identify what has been a great investment (e.g., a strongly performing company) as great, and they don't pay enough attention to its pricing, even though its pricing (whether it is cheap or expensive) is the most important thing. At this time, it is typical for almost everyone to be looking to make money by buying assets that they believe will go up (rather than betting on them going down), and they quite often use leverage.

At the time of my writing this in early March 2025, the most popular meme is that we should be optimistic about the future because by and large things are now good, AI companies are great and will make things better, and the Trump administration will improve things because there are many inefficiencies and weaknesses that need to be fixed. He will fix them because he is taking a strong, practical, capitalist, and business-like approach, and he is working with Elon Musk, who has an amazing track record of making brilliant inventions and world-changing products. To summarize the meme, the United States has demonstrated that it has "American exceptionalism."

I believe that this meme about American exceptionalism has merit, but at the same time, by my measures, it is now more than reflected in the prices, and there could be other big problems ahead.

More specifically, I have no doubt that the US is exceptional in having a well-developed system. It is characterized by:

## 1. innovation,
## 2. well-developed capital markets that finance smart risk-taking in the pursuit of profits (which by and large naturally produce cost efficiencies and survival of the fittest), and
## 3. A well-developed legal system in which most people know the rules of the game and disagreements can be resolved without fighting to produce exceptional successes when measured against key performance indicators (KPIs) like total wealth and power.

At the same time, the system is producing great gaps in education levels, productivities, incomes, wealth, power, and opportunities that are extremely difficult to rectify and that threaten the long-term health of the country. The big debt issue of there being too much debt relative to the demand for it will almost certainly lead to big fundamental changes in the monetary system, which will change what money is and how it works, which will happen either before the crisis in an attempt to prevent it or in response to the crisis. At a high level, while there are variations in how each of these debt crisis cases plays out, it almost always becomes relatively undesirable to hold the debt assets (e.g., bonds) compared with other storeholds of wealth that don't lose buying power when the value of money goes down.

It's also worth noting that during Stage 5 of the Big Cycle, which we are now in, the domestic debt/economic situation is greatly affected by the domestic political and social order force, the international geopolitical force, acts of nature, and changes in technology. It is now the case that the internal political and external geopolitical conflicts that most countries are in are having bigger effects on countries' finances than at any time since the 1930s. For example, onshoring, friendshoring, and other forms of ensuring that critical supplies cannot be cut off by foreign enemies have become more important economic policy drivers than cost efficiency. This is happening for the first time since World War II; it is costly and typically leads to more indebtedness. Likewise, countries' finances are also having bigger effects on the internal political and external geopolitical conflicts than at any time since the end of the last Big Cycle.

As far as emerging countries are concerned, they break down into two types: those that are overcoming their obstacles and surging ahead economically and financially (e.g., India, Indonesia, and most other ASEAN countries, and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries) and those that are falling further behind (e.g., poor and disorderly developing countries, especially those that have very little money and are adversely impacted by climate change). It is logical, and it appears to be the case, that the financially strong, orderly, and relatively geopolitically neutral countries that have the best people and the most rewarding systems are doing the best and will continue to do the best. That is because I still believe that globalization is an unstoppable force. Despite the growing nationalism and the increased desire of many countries' leaders to protect and control, I am seeing vastly more globalized deal-making that brings together people of all nationalities who have money to brainstorm on how to do deals with each other than I did 10 years ago. The people and what they are doing are very multinational and becoming more so fast. This has been an unstoppable evolutionary trend that has existed throughout history and is accelerating.

## 2. The Domestic Order and Disorder Force

As for where we are in the short-term political cycle, since Donald Trump and the Republican Party won the 2024 elections by a large enough margin to avoid disputes about who won, the US has had an orderly transfer of power. The principle that applies to such transitions is:

At the beginning of a new popularly chosen leader coming to power—e.g., in the first 100 days of a new presidency—there is a honeymoon period and great optimism. That is when dreams of great changes and great improvements exist, and before realities and criticisms of how the new leader has shaped and handled them set in. As time passes, typically the big promises the leader made to get elected become difficult to deliver, and bad things happen, so disappointment sets in, critics and enemies become bolder, and support wanes. All this makes fighting to stay in power harder, which often leads to more extreme actions to make that happen.

After just a few weeks of the new administration, it should not be a controversial statement that Donald Trump wants to dictate policies rather than have a classic "let's work together across party lines" approach to governing. This confrontational approach is an extension of how great internal political conflict has become in recent decades. The following charts show two measures of how internal political conflicts in the US are among the most severe in history. The first one shows how conservative Republicans in the Senate and House and how liberal Democrats in the Senate and House have become relative to the past. Based on this measure, they have become more extreme, and their divergence has become larger than ever before. While I'm not sure that's exactly right, I think it's by and large right.

IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS OF THE MAJOR PARTIES

Also, votes along party lines for the average member of Congress are the highest ever. This continues to be reflected in the reduced willingness to cross party lines to compromise and reach agreements. In other words, the political splits in the country have become deep and intransigent.

SHARE OF CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS' VOTES CAST ALONG PARTY LINES

The fact that this is a global phenomenon and that it is happening in different degrees in different countries is captured in the next table, which shows an increasing majority of people surveyed in many countries saying that there are very strong or somewhat strong conflicts between people who support different political parties in their own country.

GLOBAL POLITICAL POLARIZATION INDEX

These are just a few measures of many that reflect high and rising internal conflict. It appears clear that, as the gaps in people's productivity, wealth, and values grow along with levels of dissatisfaction about how their democracies are working, it leads to more populist conflict and more policies that are like those in the 1905-14 and the 1933-38 periods. As I explained earlier, such times of conflict are often when transitions toward more autocratic forms of government happen.

When democracies fail, autocracies come in.

Within countries, intensifying populist conflicts between those of the hard right, those of the weak middle, and those of the hard left are now taking place, with big political shifts (mostly toward the hard right) and revolutionary changes resulting from them. In this environment in which those who are productive are rewarded and those who are unproductive suffer, the least productive and the poorest will suffer the most. As history shows us, this situation typically has threatening consequences.

In times of disorder, financial, political, and military power matters more than laws, and authoritarianism works better than weak, disorganized collectivism. We are now seeing the dramatic part of the movie being played out by Donald Trump and his administration taking control of the US to try to reverse its decline to "make America great again." He is doing this by trying to make America competitive again, while at the same time we are also seeing many leaders in many countries, industries, and companies, and people broadly trying to outcompete the others. That competition is now so vicious that it includes the willingness to kill competitors.

As shown in history, the transfer of power from democracy to autocracy was more often than not orderly within the democracy because people were sick and tired of the system failing to work and wanted to give power to a leader who would take control of the mess and make it work well. Clearly, this is now happening. But it has also always been the case that, after transfers of power, new leaders during periods of great conflict take steps to consolidate power—and more autocratic leaders do so more forcefully. Because the opposition remains threatening, it has to be dealt with so that its ability to threaten is reduced, which will likely be done by the leader and the party in power increasingly taking control of the law. We are now seeing this happen in the US through the president's use of executive orders. As always, we will see how far this will go when what the executive leader wants to do and what the other parts of the tripartite government want to do (i.e., the judiciary and Congress) come into conflict.

We should expect that there will be more fights—legal and otherwise—between factions and particularly between the president/executive branch and the other branches of government (especially the judicial branch) and between the federal, state, and local governments. These fights will make clear who really has the power. In a limits-of-power-testing battle between the power of the executive branch of government and the judicial branch of government, the judicial branch will lose because the executive branch has much more control over the powers of enforcement. In fact, the Department of Justice is part of the executive branch of government and is under presidential control. The powers of enforcement are the army.

and the National Guard and state and local police, with the president having control over the first two and the judicial branch having control over none. For these reasons, it was easy for Donald Trump to order dropping the case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. We should expect many more power struggles. I have little doubt that the president will win most of these.

Different people have different views of whether this kind of leadership is a good thing or a bad thing. In Chapter 8, I described how the approaches of a strong CEO and those of a demagogue can be indistinguishable as both are people who take control and make radical changes with the goal of making radical improvements. That is certainly the case with Donald Trump. Is Donald Trump a demagogue? According to Plato, a demagogue is a political leader who gains power by appealing to people's emotions, fears, prejudices, and desires, often using manipulative rhetoric. Demagogues typically stir up populist sentiment and promise easy solutions to complex problems, often at the expense of truth or rational discourse. The question is what will the controls be and how far will Trump push things? Unlike for a CEO, there is no board for the US president. Are there effective regulators in place? If so, it is not clear to me who they are.

When I say that the policies President Trump is using to "make America great again" are remarkably like the policies that those of the hard-right countries in the 1930s used, that should not be controversial. It would be fair to argue that his attempts to maximize the power of the presidency by bypassing the other branches of government are analogous to the ways that Andrew Jackson (of the right) and Franklin D. Roosevelt (of the left) did, though he is even more aggressive than they were. We will see how far he will take it. In the typical historical case, in times of great conflict, aggressive leaders work to eliminate the opposition by threats and damaging action, by making changes in the law that give the leaders special powers, and by taking increased control over the media to produce pro-government propaganda. If conflicts with internal or external opponents become severe, laws and punishments targeting the opposition will be imposed.

While the changes to government that President Trump is making are radical in terms of intended cost savings and must be done quickly to be successfully accomplished, there are negative consequences to these cuts because many people who will be hurt by them will fight back and valuable support systems will be weakened or eliminated. For example, my wife works to help the poorest students in the worst neighborhoods who suffer from inadequate nutrition and rely on school lunch programs that are being eliminated, which will have terrible second-order consequences. Second-order consequences like these should be taken into consideration when thinking about what the future will look like after the radical changes are made.

Remember that to be successful, the system must produce adequate conditions for most people. Will that happen? The challenge in the US is that there is and has been a deep and pervasive rot in our education, family, and social systems that has resulted in many children not being brought up to lead productive, civil, and healthy lives. This is a multigenerational problem that is nearly impossible to fix, especially with fragmented leadership and inadequate resources directed to dealing with it. Currently, only a small percentage of the population is highly productive and prosperous. More specifically, the top $1\%$ of people (and increasingly machines) are making revolutionary changes. They, along with the next $9\%$ who help them, together make up the top $10\%$ and are doing great. The next $30\%$ are doing so-so, and the bottom $60\%$ are doing terribly—i.e., they are net costs rather than net contributors. (On average, they have attained less than a sixth-grade reading level and get more in public assistance payments than they pay in taxes.) The Trump administration's policies are aimed at raising productivity by shifting more money, power, and freedom into the hands of those who are most productive. This will have second-order consequences that everyone, especially those in the Trump administration, should consider. It's not easy to manage and improve a country that has been mismanaged and in such a mess while also keeping people happy at a time when democracy is fracturing. I recommend regularly checking on how those in the bottom $60\%$ are doing and feeling.

## 3. The International Order and Disorder Force

We are now seeing the international order changing in ways that are typical at this stage in the Big Cycle—i.e., there is a shift from a more cooperative, multilateral world order that pursues common interests (e.g., trade) to a classic great power conflict in which there is a more confrontational, unilateral world order that pursues self-interest through the bold use of financial, political, and military power. As described earlier, this is the part of a Big Cycle when there is a shift toward authoritarian, confrontational leadership. As is classic in Stage 5 and as we are seeing now, there is a type of world war going on that has turned more violent locally (e.g., Russia versus Ukraine, Israel versus Iran and its proxies) but has not yet turned violent between the leading global powers (the US and China).

At this stage, it is increasingly true that the strong prey on the weak. As a result, the weak empire should worry. Which is the weak empire? President Trump, Vladimir Putin, and everyone including the Europeans know that Europe is weak and easy prey. Russia will likely be an enemy of Europe, and Trump's "America First" policy will likely lead to it not defending Europe. Also, everyone knows that Trump is hard-right, so he is inclined to align the US with those who are hard-right and capable of fighting, and to use both carrots and sticks to make people and countries do what he wants them to do. That is what is driving the reshaping of the new world order and the "allied powers" side led by the US. It is also important to remember that at this stage in the Big Cycle, alliances often change fast as circumstances change quickly and winning is more important than loyalties. For example, Germany and Russia quickly switched from allies to enemies in World War II. We should expect alliances to change fast and in previously unimaginable ways—e.g., it would not surprise me if Trump's US and Putin's Russia align, with China becoming more isolated as there is no true love and fidelity between Russia and China. Likewise, we might find Europe and China more aligned than Europe and the US. These sorts of previously unimaginable changes have often occurred at this stage in the Big Cycle. We will learn a lot shortly.

As far as the great power conflict between the US and China goes, it cannot be objectively disputed that the United States has been in relative decline and that the conflicts with China are increasing. This is clearly shown in the following charts. The one on the left shows my measure of the total powers (including my 21 measures of power) and the one on the right shows my gauge of the intensity of the US-China conflict. It shows the great power conflict and the Thucydides Trap dynamic in action.

US-CHINA CONFLICT GAUGE

President Trump is seeking to reverse that relative decline at the same time as the US and China are clearly in a war that has not yet become a military war. It is not clear at this time (early March 2025) exactly what US-China relations—or, more broadly, international relations—will be like.

I don't expect a military war between the US and China in the foreseeable future because both sides know that it would lead to mutually assured destruction. I think the only thing that China would go to war over is a real threat to its sovereignty, which includes the Taiwan issue. Also, I don't think any American president would go to war unless there was an existential threat (like losing TSMC's chip production). At the same time, I could imagine that President Trump would be willing to negotiate Taiwan away under the right terms for the right price. Trump and Xi are strongmen running great powers and will have regular conversations to negotiate directly with each other. Both want to avoid a military war and existential threats to their countries while each would also love to eliminate the other as a threat.

The only way I can see either side winning a war is by secretly building a technology of overwhelming power that can be deployed without triggering an intolerable retaliation so that simply demonstrating it to the other side would lead to some form of capitulation. This has been done throughout history. This would be akin to the secretive development of the atomic bomb and the displaying of its power to the Japanese via the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To be clear, I am not ruling out such a scenario because I am sure that both countries are working on the development of mind-blowingly powerful technologies that remain secret.

No one on either side believes that the US-China relationship will go back to what it was. Though neither side wants military war, the US and China are currently engaged in other types of war, including diplomatic, cyber, and trade wars in which they are severely threatening and hurting each other. It is not disputable that there is a deep-seated belief that the other side is an enemy and is doing very harmful things to the other. This is risky because the most important and threatening stuff is going on in secret, so it can't be controlled unless it is self-controlled, which, under the circumstances, neither side will do.

Still, my bet is that China will try to stay out of an overt fight for geopolitical dominance outside its region while a) acting to build great power that can be used to harm those who harm it and b) moving to achieve the unification of Taiwan with China, which is widely believed to be a goal that President Xi, who is now in his early 70s, would like to achieve in his lifetime. For those reasons, as mentioned above, if I were the Taiwanese, I would worry about my country being used as a negotiating chip for the US to offer to China in return for great concessions. Of course, such a deal would have to eliminate any semiconductor chip vulnerabilities for the US that would result in

China controlling Taiwan. I also expect China to continue to build important relationships in the Global South using both its economic and geopolitical power because that is a huge market for its very attractively priced manufactured goods and construction companies.

While governments are becoming more nationalistic and protectionist, the world, investors, and businesspeople have become more interdependent than at any time in history, and investment and business deal-making are more international than ever before. For that reason, what is happening domestically affects what is happening internationally, and vice versa, more than ever before, and what is happening economically is affecting what is happening geopolitically, and vice versa, more than ever before. This is having policy, investment, and business implications. For example, the need to win the tech war is leading to top-down, government-directed domestic and international policies for chip production, data center investment and development, electricity production, embargoes on technologies, sanctions, CFIUS and reverse CFIUS tariffs, global talent acquisition, etc. To me, the big questions are how practical the respective world leaders are, how they and their opponents will deal with each other, and how orderly and smartly things will be managed when times get tough. My take is that international investment and business deals will get easier and increase in number rather than get harder and fewer.

Keep in mind that while that is what I think about the world's geopolitical order, I'm not sure of anything.

## 4. The Force of Nature (Droughts, Floods, and Pandemics)

We certainly cannot overlook the power and impacts of nature. As I described in Chapter 8, throughout history acts of nature have killed more people than wars and toppled more orders than all the other four forces combined. It is likely that in the years ahead, acts of nature will increase in frequency and be very costly. Given how

Heavily indebted and burdened with other demands, the world's major nations now are. Very little is going to proactively prevent and prepare for the high costs of a changing natural world. But the costs will be incurred regardless—either by paying to prevent the damages or paying to fix things after damages occur from intolerably hot weather, droughts, floods, rising sea levels, health problems, damage to the oceans that will change currents and sea life, species loss, and many other things likely to happen in the years ahead. This will require significant amounts of money being spent to adapt to these changes. For countries in the Global South that are experiencing big effects from climate change and don't have the resources to address them, this could lead to domestic conflict and emigration. Displaced people in turn will strain other countries, as we are already seeing with immigration in the US and Europe, making both domestic and international politics more unstable.

## 5. The Technology/Human Productivity Force

While the trends of the first four forces appear to be worsening, the technology force has never, in the whole history of humanity, been more powerful than it is now and will be over the next few years. It looks to me like we are now at the brink of a new era in which machine thinking will supplement or surpass human thinking in many ways, like how machine labor supplemented and surpassed human labor during the Industrial Revolutions. Just as we saw that doing math in our heads and remembering facts became much less important with the invention of computerized tools that do these things, and just as we have gone to Google (or its equivalents) to find information rather than gathering information in more traditional ways, we will soon be going to computers to get our instructions on what to do when we are in different situations because the computer will come up with better guidance more quickly than we can.

Over the next five years, we will see dramatic advancements in most areas. Creating the AI capabilities is just the beginning of the

AI applications. I know that in my area of investing, where I and Bridgewater have been doing AI investing through expert systems for decades, the opportunities that are being developed are nearly unbelievable. The days of people making decisions in their own heads are ending. I and others at Bridgewater have experienced and capitalized on this (r)evolution via the computerization of investment decision-making, so I'm excited by what will be happening.

Because these technologies will impact almost everything, there will be exceptionally big differences between the performance levels of countries, investors, and companies who use them well. Those who know how to use these tools effectively will be rewarded, and those who fail to do so will be penalized. It is worth noting, however, that from an investment perspective, it is not totally clear how much money will come in relative to the costs that will go out to invest in and create these new technologies.

The US and China are now the main competitors in designing these powerful new technologies, and how effective they are will have big impacts on their economic and military powers, though several countries are also developing and benefiting from these new technologies. While the US is ahead of China in developing the most advanced semiconductor chips and weak in its production of them, China is close behind in the development of advanced chips, ahead in producing less advanced chips much less expensively, and ahead in deploying AI. There will certainly be a lot of effort from both sides to gain an advantage over the other in this race, both by stealing/borrowing what the other side has and trying to defend one's own gains. I keep in mind the principle that $\bullet$ by and large, intellectual property protections don't work. While deep secrets that are protected with great effort (like the development of the atomic bomb) might be able to be kept hidden, anything that is openly used can almost instantly be replicated. Also, legal systems do a poor job of enforcing intellectual property protections. For these reasons, we should assume that most good ideas that are openly shown and are liked a lot will be replicated in about six months.

I should also make clear that AI isn't the only important technology shaping the relative power of nations. There are many technologies beyond chips and AI that the US and China are the main real competitors in, including quantum computing, gene editing and other biotech, robotics, space, etc. China, which is home to 20 of the 40 best computer science programs in the world,[55] is a formidable adversary to the US in the technology competition.

In conclusion, I am very excited and optimistic about the revolutionary improvements that are likely to take place as a result of inventive/practical people being put together with capital that gets them the resources that they need (perhaps most importantly, these new AI technologies) and operating in great environments that are conducive to advancement. Of course, new technologies are double-edged swords. For example, they have advanced how we can do each other harm as well as how we can do each other good. As shown in the following charts, there have been exponential improvements in real GDP and life expectancy. This is because of the accelerating, compounding rate of growth of knowledge, which should continue due to the way it is compounding via AI.

### WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE US?

To conclude where I started, what I don't know is much greater than what I do know, and as I write this in early March 2025, I am at a maximum point of uncertainty. That's because the Trump administration took office just 40 days ago, and its big moves to change the monetary, US political, and geopolitical world orders have just begun. At the same time, I also know that whatever changes we see happen will happen in similar ways for similar reasons to how they have happened many times before, though with contemporary twists. So, it appears to me that the changes in these orders will likely continue to track my template, which is based on the patterns of the past and the logical relationships between the five big forces.

Looking at where things are headed over the next few years, I believe that very powerful technological advances will most likely not be enough to overpower the headwinds coming from the other forces. I derived this view by looking at the amazing digital/computer/internet boom that we have experienced since 1985 and at the impacts of great discoveries and advances in technologies (e.g., railroads, steam engines, electricity, flight) at times when the other four forces turned negative. I used these cases as references for what might happen over the next 30 years due to the new technologies that are coming in AI, robotics, quantum computing, biotech, etc., and I asked myself what effect those prior technologies' leaps had on productivity.

More specifically, I estimated that the positive impacts of today's new technologies will be about  $150\%$  of what happened over the last 30 years. By my measures, this would make today's technological revolution the most powerful ever in terms of its impact on markets and economic conditions. But my back-of-the-envelope calculations also show that this positive force will not be enough to negate the headwinds of debt, internal conflict, external conflict, climate change, and demographics. Similarly and interestingly, when I looked at other periods of high inventiveness such as in the Industrial Revolutions and the 1920s, what I saw is that the productivity-improving powers of the great new technologies were normally squelched when the other forces of the Big Cycle turned negative. So, it appears to me that the most important factor for the years ahead is that the other forces are managed well.

I am confident that the next 5-10 years will be a period of enormous changes in all the major orders, and that going from now until then will feel like going through a time warp into a very different reality. Many countries, companies, and people who are now up will be down, and those who are down will be up. How we think and what we do will be very different, in ways that we can't possibly anticipate.

I also know that there are better and worse ways to play this set of circumstances, and the best way is to play the probabilities, diversify well, and stick with sound fundamentals. As far as the best places to be, I believe that they are the countries that get these fundamentals right—i.e., those that educate their people well so they are skilled and civil and have access to an environment of great opportunity for them to be productive, that earn more than they spend so they have strong national income statements and balance sheets, that have internal order rather than disorder, that have low risks of being in an international war, that have low risks of experiencing harmful acts of nature, and that benefit the most from changes in technology.[56]

Having great human capital will matter most.

As I explained earlier, the biggest, most important force is how people deal with each other. If people treat their problems and opportunities as being shared and they focus on getting the best outcomes for the whole without damaging each other, they will likely get the best possible results. For example, as described in the last chapter, it is now possible for government leaders to manage their countries' debts and monies well—e.g., for the US to cut its deficits down to  $3\%$  of GDP—which would greatly reduce the risks of a government debt market/economic crisis. Similarly, domestic and world orders, acts of nature, and the managing of the amazing new technologies will have much better outcomes if those who have their hands on the levers of power work well together.

Unfortunately, I believe that an objective examination of how likely these things are to transpire would conclude that the chances of cooperation for mutual benefit are not good. The reality is that the events that have brought the Big Cycle to where it is today have left strong beliefs within most factions that the people in the opposing factions are doing them harm—and that the time has come to fight and win at all costs. Those in the opposing factions also believe that they must fight to win at all costs. We know from history that extreme factionalism kills.

Hopefully, this picture makes people worry and motivates them to do what is still in their power to do to improve things, which brings me to a final principle: If you're not worried, you need to worry—and if you're worried, you don't need to worry. That's because worrying about the things that can go wrong will protect you, while not worrying about them will leave you exposed.

I hope you find good principles to prepare for the interesting times ahead.

### ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Ray Dalio has been a global macro investor for more than 50 years. In 1975, he founded Bridgewater Associates from his two-bedroom apartment and built it over four decades into the largest and most successful hedge fund in the world and the fifth most important private company in the US, according to Fortune magazine.

Dalio grew up a very ordinary middle-class kid on Long Island and started investing when he was 12 years old. Over the course of his career, he has become a renowned author and speaker, an advisor to top policymakers, and one of the "100 Most Influential People in the World," according to TIME. CIO and Wired have called him "the Steve Jobs of investing" for his uniquely inventive and industry-changing way of thinking. He has also been named by Forbes as one of the 50 most generous philanthropists in the US.

In 2017, he decided to pass along the principles behind his success in a series of books and animated videos. His 2017 book *Principles: Life and Work* was a No. 1 New York Times Best Seller and the No. 1 Amazon business book of the year. It has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide and has been translated into over 30 languages. His 2021 book *Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order* was also a New York Times Best Seller and has sold more than 1 million copies worldwide. Dalio has also created a series of 30-minute animated YouTube videos ("How the Economic Machine Works," "Principles for Success," and "Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order"), which have together been watched more than 250 million times. His 2018 book *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises* was well-received by economists, policymakers, and investors.

In this latest book, How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle, Dalio is for the first time sharing his unique template for understanding the final stages of what he calls the "Big Debt Cycle" and showing how these stages help drive to the "Overall Big Cycle" that governs the kinds of radical monetary, political, and geopolitical changes we are seeing in the world today.
