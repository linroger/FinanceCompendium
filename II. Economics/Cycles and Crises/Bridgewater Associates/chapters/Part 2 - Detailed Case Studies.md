There is a critical relationship between a) the interest rate difference and b) the spot/forward currency relationship. The amount the currency is expected to decline is priced into how much less the forward price is below the spot price. For example, if the market expects the currency to fall by 5 percent over a year, it will need that currency to yield a 5 percent higher interest rate. The math is even starker when depreciation is expected over short periods of time. If the market expects a 5 percent depreciation over a month, than it will need that currency to yield a 5 percent higher interest rate over that month—and a 5 percent monthly interest is equivalent to an annual interest rate of about 80 percent In 1914, German government debt was insignificant. By 1918, Germany had amassed a total local currency debt stock of 100 billion marks, about 130 percent of German GDP.

Although this stock of debt was huge, prior to the German surrender and the imposition of war reparations, most of it was denominated in local currency. Policy makers recognized that this was a good thing. According to the Reichsbank, "the greatest weakness in the war financing of the enemies is their growing indebtedness abroad [particularly to the US]," as it forces them to scramble for dollars when needing to make debt-service payments. In contrast, most German debt taken on to finance the war (prior to reparations) was in local currency and financed by Germans.

Up until the second half of 1916, the German public was both willing and able to finance the entire fiscal deficit by purchasing government debt. In fact, war bond issuances were regularly oversubscribed. However, as the war dragged on and inflation accelerated, the Treasury found that the public was no longer prepared to hold all the debt it was issuing. This was partly due to the size of the deficit, increasing substantially as the war progressed, but also because wartime inflation had caused real interest rates to become very negative (government war bonds paid out a fixed interest rate of 5 percent throughout the war, whereas inflation had climbed above  $30\%$  by early 1915), which resulted in lenders not being adequately compensated for holding government debt.[10] The inflation was being driven by wartime disruptions and shortages, capacity constraints in key war industries, and currency weakness (the mark would fall about 25 percent against the dollar by 1916).[11] While some naive lenders clung to the hope that the government would return to the gold standard at the old exchange rate once the war was over, or compensate them for any losses due to inflation, others feared they would most likely be paid in money that had lost most of its purchasing power, so they ran out of debt denominated in that currency.[12]

German Public Subscription for War Bonds (\% Issuance)

The currency remained an effective medium of exchange while losing its effectiveness as a store hold of wealth. So, the government borrowed money to pay for its war expenditures, and the Reichsbank was forced to monetize the debt as investors came up short in supplying the money. This had the effect of increasing the money supply by an amount equal to the fiscal deficit not financed by the public. As debt monetization is inflationary (there is more money in the economy chasing the same quantity of goods and services), a self-reinforcing spiral ensued—i.e., debt monetization increased inflation, which reduced real interest rates, which discouraged lending to the government, which encouraged additional debt monetization. As the deficit was huge (averaging about 40 percent of GDP between 1914 and 1918), this led to the money supply increasing by almost 300 percent over the course of the war.[13]

The pace of money creation accelerated after 1917 as German citizens became increasingly unwilling to purchase government debt, and the central bank was forced to monetize a growing share of the deficit.[14] Although the number of marks in circulation almost doubled between mid-1917 and mid-1918, it did not cause a material decline in the currency. In fact, the mark rallied over this period as Russia's withdrawal increased expectations of a German victory. The mark only began falling in the second half of 1918, as a German defeat began looking increasingly likely.[15]

In the last two years of the war, the German government began borrowing in foreign currencies because lenders were unwilling to take promises to pay in marks.[16] When a country has to borrow in a foreign currency, it's a bad sign. By 1918, the Reichsbank and private firms each owed about 2.5 billion gold marks in FX to external lenders.[17] A gold mark was an artificial unit used to measure the value of a paper mark to gold. In 1914, one gold mark equaled one paper mark.[18] A debt of 5 billion gold marks was therefore a debt denominated in gold, with the bill equal to the amount of gold that could be purchased by 5 billion marks in 1914.

Unlike local currency debt, hard currency (foreign currency and gold denominated) debt cannot be printed away. Debtors would have to get their hands on either gold or foreign exchange to meet these liabilities. While the hard currency debt was less than 10 percent of the total debt stock, it was still larger than the entire public gold reserves of the Reich. $^{19}$  The hope was that once Germany won the war, the mark would appreciate, making those debt burdens more manageable. And, of course, the losing countries would be forced to pay for most of Germany's foreign and domestic debts. $^{20}$

Policy makers recognized that if Germany lost the war, or failed to extract large reparations, it would be extremely difficult to pay back these debts with hard money. According to the president of the Reichsbank, Rudolf Havenstein, covering those debts "will be extraordinarily difficult if we do not get a large war indemnity."[21] According to the German economist Edgar Jaffe, unless England paid between a third and a half of Germany's war costs, the result would be the "monstrous catastrophe" of "currency collapse" once German citizens learned that domestic debts would likely be paid in depreciated money, and government agencies and private firms scrambled to get their hands on foreign exchange to pay off external liabilities.[22]

Breaking the peg to gold and monetizing an ever-growing fiscal deficit, combined with wartime economic disruptions and shortages, led to a declining exchange rate and a pickup in inflation. By the beginning of 1918, the mark had lost about 25 percent of its value versus the dollar and prices had tripled.

However, in the context of WWI, this was pretty typical—i.e., it's what most countries did to fund their wars. German inflation, while high, was not significantly higher than that of other war participants, as you can see in the chart below.[23] But only a few of the war's many participants ended up with hyperinflation, for reasons I will soon explain.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/e6d85ad5a639429efa59ed06743631fca5bd6413a60ab2cfa6776418c99c5dc5.jpg)

I bring up this point to underline the fact that WWI (and the accompanying monetization of debt) did not directly cause Germany's postwar inflationary depression. As mentioned in the archetype template, while inflationary depressions are possible in all countries/currencies, they are most common in countries that:

- Don't have a reserve currency: So there is not a global bias to hold their currency/debt as a store hold of wealth
- Have low foreign exchange reserves: So there is not much of a cushion to protect against capital outflows
- Have a large stock of foreign debt: So there is a vulnerability to the cost of debt rising via increases in either interest rates or the value of the currency the debtor has to deliver, or a shortage of available credit denominated in that currency
- Have a large and increasing budget and/or current account deficit: So there is a need to borrow or print money to fund the deficits
- Have negative real interest rates: So lenders are not adequately compensated for holding the currency/debt
- Have a history of high inflation and negative total returns in the currency: So there is a lack of trust in the value of the currency/debt

By the end of the war, the German economy met all of these conditions. Losing the war meant that the mark was not going to be the reserve currency of the postwar era. A large stock of external debts had been acquired,

Germans Reach Versailles, Treaty to Be Signed Today and it was very likely that the Allies would force Germany to pay them an additional sum in war reparations. Foreign exchange reserves were not sufficient to meet the existing stock of external debts, let alone any additional reparation payments. Real interest rates were very negative, and offered little compensation to creditors holding German currency/debt. The budget and the trade balance were also in very large deficits, meaning that Germany would remain dependent on borrowing/monetization to finance expenditures and consumption. Finally, the experience of high inflation, money printing, and negative total returns in holding the mark had begun to reduce trust in the German currency/debt as a store hold of value.

# November 1918-March 1920: The Treaty of Versailles and the First Inflation

News of the German surrender in November 1918 was met with a wave of capital flight out of Germany. German citizens and firms rushed to convert their wealth into the currencies and assets of the victorious powers, not knowing what the terms of the peace would be or exactly how the German government would pay for its massive stock of liabilities now that it had lost the war. Over the next few months, the mark declined about 30 percent against the dollar, the German stock market lost almost half its real value, and government debt in local currency rose by about 30 percent, almost all of which had to be monetized by the central bank. As a result, the money supply grew by about 50 percent and the inflation rate climbed to 30 percent.

This capital flight occurred despite initial optimism that the final terms of the peace would not be particularly harsh. Many members of the German negotiation team hoped that reparations would be limited to damage done in territories occupied by German forces, and would be paid primarily in goods instead of currency.[24] US President Woodrow Wilson's emphasis on self-determination also led many Germans to believe that there would be no annexations of German territory without at least a referendum. Many Germans therefore expected that their country would come out of the war with its territory and economic capacity intact, and that the reparation burden would not be too vindictive.[25]

When the final terms of the Treaty of Versailles were revealed, they came as a huge shock. Germany was to lose 12 percent of its territory through annexations, 10 percent of its population, 43 percent of its pig-iron capacity, and 38 percent of its steel capacity.[26] Germany was also required to compensate Allied citizens for all wealth seized during the war (within Germany and in occupied territories), but it would receive no compensation for its own assets (both real and financial) that had been confiscated abroad. The German government would also have to honor all prewar debts to Allied creditors, even if they were the debts of private citizens. As for reparations, a commission was to be established in 1921 that would determine the final bill after evaluating Germany's capacity to pay and giving its government another chance to be heard on the subject. In the interim, Germany would pay an equivalent of 20 billion marks in gold, commodities, ships, securities, and other real assets to compensate the Allies for the costs of occupation.[27]

Germany had no option but to agree to these terms or face total occupation. It signed the treaty on June 28, 1919. This triggered another sharp plunge in the exchange rate,[28] with the mark falling 90 percent against the dollar between July, 1919 and January, 1920. Inflation surged, hitting 140 percent by the end of the year. Once again, the mark's drop was driven primarily by German citizens rushing to get their capital out of the country because they justifiably feared that these promises to deliver currency (i.e., these debt obligations) would make it very difficult, if not impossible, for the German government to meet its liabilities with hard money. To do that, the Reich would have to levy extortionately high taxes and confiscate private wealth. As the real wealth of private citizens was at risk, getting out of the currency and the country made sense.

As the mark fell, German debtors with external liabilities saw the real expenses of their debts soar. They rushed to pay off as many of their foreign debts as they could, flooding the foreign exchange market. This further weakened the mark, triggering additional rounds of capital flight. This dynamic is also very common in countries with large foreign currency denominated debt during a debt/balance of payments crisis. As a prominent Hamburg industrialist noted at the time, "We are driving ourselves to destruction if everyone now… secretly sells mark notes in order to be able to meet his obligations. If things keep on this way, the mark notes will become unusable."[29]

To be clear: at this point money printing was not the source of the currency weakness so much as currency weakness was the cause of money printing. In other words, capital flight from the currency and the country was driving the currency down, which in turn helped drive higher inflation. That's classically how inflationary depressions happen.

Naturally, as money leaves a currency/debt market, that puts the central bank in the position of having to choose between a) allowing the liquidity and debt markets to tighten up a lot and b) printing money to fill in the void. Central banks typically print money to fill the void, which causes currencies to decline.

While currency declines hurt importers and those with debts in foreign currencies, devaluations are stimulative for the economy and its asset markets, which is helpful during a period of economic weakness. Currency declines provide a boost to exports and profit margins, as they make a country's goods cheaper on international markets. Simultaneously, they make imports more expensive, supporting domestic industries. Devaluations also cause assets to rise in value when measured in local currency, and they attract capital from abroad as a country's financial assets become cheaper in global currency terms.

From July 1919 through March 1920, the decline in the mark and negative real rates provided a boost to the German economy and its equity and commodity markets.

The export industry also thrived, unemployment declined, and as real wages remained low, business profitability improved. You can see the decline in unemployment and the pickup in exports in the charts below. (Note that all unemployment statistics from the time only show unemployment among trade union members, so they likely understate the true amount of unemployment and hardship in German society. However, they do show that employment conditions were improving.)

There was also the hope that by encouraging exports and discouraging imports, the mark's decline would be a one-off and would help bring the German balance of payments into equilibrium. According to one prominent German official:

"I regard our gravely ailing currency as an admirable means of dispelling the hatred felt abroad towards Germany, and of overcoming the reluctance to trade with us by our enemies. The American who no longer gets for his dollar 4.21 marks worth of goods from us, but 6.20 marks worth, will rediscover his fondness for Germany."30

German policy makers also began considering ways to deal with the domestic debt burden and the fiscal deficit. As one official described policy since the end of the war, "All we have done is keep printing."[31] To reduce the deficit, and raise revenues to meet debt liabilities, a comprehensive tax-reform package was proposed by finance minister Matthias Erzberger. Known as the "Erzberger Financial Reform," the package would transfer from the "haves" to the "have-nots" by levying highly progressive taxes on income and wealth (with top rates for income approaching 60 percent, and those for wealth at 65 percent).[32]

Passed in December 1919, the Erzberger Reforms would go on to increase the share of the Reich's income coming from direct taxes to 75 percent (the 1914 figure had been about 15 percent) and raise enough revenue to pay for all government expenditures except reparations by 1922.[33] Prior to these reforms, the majority of the government revenue came from public enterprises (primarily railroads), as well as specific duties on exports, imports, and coal.

The beneficial results of currency weakness led many German policy makers to advocate relying on currency weakness and inflation (from rising import prices and central bank printing) as an effective alternative to "confiscatory taxation."34 One such official was Dr. Friedrich Bendixen, who argued that "every effort to collect the monstrous sum through taxes will weaken our productivity and thus reduce receipts and drive the Reich to economic collapse…only the transformation of the war loans into money can bring salvation."35 Inflation would "cleanse" Germany of its local currency war debts and allow it to "begin a new life on the basis of new money." Although this program was explicitly rejected by the central bank, it recognized that things might "develop along these lines anyway." They did: inflation climbed to almost 200 percent, and by the end of 1919 it had reduced the domestic war-debt burden to about 25 percent of its original 1918 value. As you might imagine, those with wealth scrambled to buy foreign currencies or real assets to prevent their wealth from being either inflated or taken away.36

deflationary recession. This would allow the Reich to pay back its citizens something closer to the true value of their loaned wealth, but it would also crush domestic credit creation and demand, generating significant unemployment. Germany faced the classic dilemma: whether to help those who are long the currency (i.e., creditors who hold debt denominated in it) or those who are short it (i.e., debtors who owe it). In economic crises, policies to redistribute wealth from "haves" to "have-nots" are more likely to occur. This is because the conditions of the "have-nots" become intolerable and also because there are more "have-nots" than "haves."

At the time, relieving debt burdens and redistributing wealth were higher priorities than preserving the wealth of creditors. Unemployment was still high, food shortages were rampant, and a large mass of returning soldiers from the front needed jobs so they could be reintegrated into the economy. Clashes between capitalists and workers, as are typical in depressions, were also happening all across Europe. There had been a Communist revolution in Russia in 1917, and Communist ideas were spreading around the world. Commenting on the choice between inflation and deflation at the time, the legendary British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote: "The inflation is unjust and deflation is inexpedient. Of the two perhaps deflation is the worse, because it is worse in an impoverished world to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the rentier [i.e., the capitalist lender]."37

Although levels of activity remained very depressed, by late 1919/early 1920 Germany had inflated away most of its domestic debt, passed a comprehensive tax-reform package to generate new revenues, and was beginning to see a pickup in economic activity. There was also some good news on the reparations front. To relieve growing tensions between Germany and the Allies, the Allies invited Germany to submit its own proposal for how much the reparation bill should be. Critics of a harsh settlement, such as John Maynard Keynes, were finding increasing sympathy in official circles abroad. The exchange rate also began to stabilize.[38]

However, conflicts between the Left and Right remained intense in Germany. In March 1921, right-wing nationalist groups led by Wolfgang Kapp attempted to overthrow the Weimar government and institute an autocratic monarchist regime in its place. The coup collapsed within a matter of days after workers refused to cooperate with the new government and declared a general strike.[39] Although a complete failure, the "Kapp Putsch" was a reminder of how fragile the political environment remained, and was another example of how the economic pain of deleveragings/depressions can give rise to populist and reactionary leaders on both the Left and the Right. As one frustrated Berlin businessman put it:

"Just at the moment when we begin again to work more than before…when in London the recognition is mounting that through the imposition of the Versailles Treaty one has committed a fearful political stupidity, and that accordingly the exchange rate begins to improve, the military party…under the leadership of a man who is a notorious reactionary, again throws everything overboard and forces our workers into a general strike and demonstrations that are unnecessary because nothing will be achieved that way."[40]

# March 1920 to May 1921: Relative Stabilization

The fourteen months between March 1920 and May 1921 were a period of "relative stabilization."[41] The mark halted its slide, prices remained stable, and the German economy outperformed the rest of the developed world. Germany wasn't collapsing from either economic or political chaos, as many had predicted, and those shorting the mark lost considerable sums (a notable case is John Maynard Keynes, who personally lost about £13,000 on the trade).[42]

The global backdrop at the time was one of severe contraction, driven by tightening monetary policy in the US and UK. For example, between 1920 and 1921, industrial production fell by 20 percent in the US and 18.6 percent in the UK, while unemployment climbed to 22 percent and 11.8 percent respectively.[43]

Unemployment Rate

In contrast to other central banks, the Reichsbank kept monetary policy very easy—the discount rate remained at 5 percent until 1922.[44] The Reichsbank also regularly intervened to inject additional liquidity when credit conditions tightened. For instance, in the spring of 1921, when business liquidity tightened moderately, the Reichsbank responded by accelerating its purchases of commercial bills (from 3.1 percent to 9 percent of bills outstanding).[45] Fiscal policy also remained accommodative, with real expenditures (ex-reparations) rising in 1920 and 1921.[46] Although the budget deficit narrowed, it remained huge—roughly 10 percent of GDP—and continued to be financed by the issuance of floating debt.

The stimulative policies allowed Germany to escape the global contraction and enjoy relatively strong economic conditions. Between 1919 and 1921, industrial production increased by 75 percent! However, as you can see in the charts below, levels of economic activity remained extremely depressed (e.g., industrial production and real GDP were still well below 1913 levels), and there was considerable poverty and suffering in German society. This period should be understood as one of growth within a larger period of economic contraction.

Rising economic activity and deflationary policies did not result in much inflation in Germany between March 1920 and May 1921, as domestic inflationary pressures were being offset by global deflationary forces. Import prices from the US and UK fell by about 50 percent, and rising capital flows into the outperforming German economy helped to stabilize the currency, which allowed for slower growth in the money supply. As you can see in the charts below, this was a significant turnaround. The mark rallied, inflation declined, and by early 1921 prices stopped rising for the first time since 1914.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/89bf089f5e2ce991095287ff03539ed0fc8c7600b5ecc893cef0f60ce89d074b.jpg)

There was also considerable optimism about the German economy abroad—in fact, it became the new hot economy to invest in, as reflected by foreigners' willingness to pour money into it, which financed an ever-growing trade deficit. In fact, some commentators at the time began referring to Germany's surging capital inflows as a "tremendous" speculative bubble, with Keynes even calling it "the greatest ever known." Many of those flooding the market with mark orders were new buyers, with no prior experience in the market they were trading—one of the classic signs of a bubble. According to Keynes:

"From those] in the streets of the capital…[to] barber's assistants in the remotest townships of Spain and South America…the argument has been the same…Germany is a great and strong country; someday she will recover; when that happens the mark will recover also, which will bring a very large profit."47

For some perspective on the size of these inflows, by 1921 almost a third of all deposits in the seven largest German banks were foreign-owned.[48] These speculative inflows supported a relative stabilization in the mark. It also made the central bank's job much easier by reducing the inherent trade-offs between growth and inflation. As explained in my description of the archetypal template, when capital is flowing into a country, it tends to lower the country's inflation rate and stimulate its growth rate (all other things being equal); when capital leaves, it tends to do the opposite, making the central bank's job much more difficult.

Strong capital inflows also meant that the German economy became increasingly dependent on "hot money" (i.e., speculative investments that could be pulled out at a moment's notice) continuing to come in, year after year, to finance fiscal and external deficits.[49] As is classic in the bubble phase of any balance of payments crisis, increasing dependence on capital inflows to maintain levels of spending and economic activity made the economic recovery fragile, and sensitive to any minor event that could trigger a shift in sentiment vis-à-vis the future prospects of the German economy.

The mark's sharp appreciation in early 1920 was an unwelcome development for policy makers because a falling mark was considered essential to maintaining German export competitiveness, supporting employment growth, and building a savings pool of hard currency earnings. It was considered the "one good fortune in the midst of misfortune," without which Germany would lose the possibility of exports.[50] The initial appreciation hit exports hard, with the chamber of commerce going as far as to say that industry had practically "ground to a halt."[51] Unemployment surged, with the number of trade union members reported as unemployed tripling. For these reasons, the economic ministry intervened between March and June 1920—aiming to deliberately depress the mark and stimulate employment. It worked. The mark fell, competitiveness returned, and unemployment once again began to decline.[52]

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/01a58e0a42eddbc250a234174d173e83c90771a6efd4d638506a4ea75b1f431d.jpg)

During this period, German policy makers were more concerned about deflationary forces spreading to Germany than the inflation that their stimulative policies could cause. Rising unemployment, and the potential social unrest it could cause, were considered much more menacing than the return of rising prices. As the reconstruction minister told a prominent industrialist:

"[I] am not afraid of the inflation…if the crisis which has already broken out to its full extent in England were not to come over to us, we should allow the printing press to do a bit more work and begin rebuilding the country. This activity would enable us to build a dam against the crisis."[53]

Of course, the stabilization of the mark, inflation, and economic conditions remained contingent on large speculative inflows into Germany and a stable balance of payments.

# May 1921: The London Ultimatum

The arguments between Germany and the Allies over reparations came to a head with "The London Ultimatum" in May 1921, in which the Allies threatened to occupy the Ruhr Basin within six days if Germany did not accept the new reparation bill. Total reparations were set at 132 billion gold marks (about 330 percent of German GDP). Fifty billion was scheduled to be paid in quarterly installments, adding up to around 3 billion gold marks a year. This was a debt-service burden of around 10 percent of German GDP, or 80 percent of export earnings.[54] Payments for the remaining 70 billion would begin whenever the Allied powers, not Germany, determined its economy capable of doing so. Not only did Germany have to service a huge hard currency debt burden, it also had to live with the threat of its debt service payments tripling at a moment's notice.

The reparations demanded were enormous and dashed expectations that a far more conciliatory agreement would be reached. The structure of the payments was also deeply unnerving to potential investors and the German public, as it meant that debt service burdens would likely get bigger if economic conditions improved.[55] For context, the chart below shows the size of the hard currency debts imposed on Germany relative to other economies prior to entering major inflationary depressions. As you can see, Weimar Germany dwarfs every other case. The second chart shows Germany's debt as a percent of GDP between 1914 and 1922.

Estimated German Government Debt (\%GDP)

As soon as the reparation burden was announced, the mark began selling off; it declined by 75 percent by the end of the year. Inflation also returned, with prices almost doubling over the same period. For one prominent German participant at Versailles, the ultimatum fulfilled his worst fears:

"The world must be made to understand that it is impossible to burden a country with debts and at the same time to deprive it of the means of paying them…the most complete collapse of the currency…cannot…be avoided if the peace treaty is maintained in its current form."[56]

The reparation schedule created a balance of payments crisis. In many ways, a balance of payments crisis is just like any other serious problem faced by individuals, households, and corporations in making a payment. To come up with the money, a country must either 1) spend less, 2) earn more, 3) finance the payments through borrowing and/or tapping into savings, or 4) default on the debt (or convince creditors to give it relief). Unlike its domestic war loans, Germany could not print away the debt burden, as the debts were not denominated in paper marks. Policy makers would need to rely on some combination of the four levers outlined above.

# Cutting Spending Would Be Extremely Painful and Politically Dangerous

Since about 50 percent of the German government's total revenues would have to be spent on reparations, cuts in nonreparation expenses would need to be drastic to make a difference.[57] Because most nonreparation spending was going towards essential social services—unemployment relief, subsidies for food and housing, and funding for leading public employers, such as the railways and shipyards—large spending cuts were considered "politically impossible." With the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and its ongoing bloody civil war, as well as the growing Communist movement in Germany, policy makers feared a potential revolution from the left. Simultaneously, the increasingly humiliating demands of the Allied powers, and the economic pain that came from meeting them, were fueling far-right nationalism. Fears of political chaos intensified as strikes, riots, and acts of political violence became increasingly common. During the summer of 1920, a state of emergency had to be declared following widespread looting;[58] in March 1921, Communist groups seized control of several shipyards and factories and were only dispersed following firefights with police;[59] and in October 1921, finance minister Matthias Erzberger was assassinated by ultranationalists for his role in the 1918 surrender.[60] Given this context, it should not be surprising that the government refused to cut back on social spending and the Reichsbank refused to stop monetizing the deficit.

# Tax Burdens Were Already Extremely High

While cutting spending was untenable, so was raising income by levying additional taxes. The problem was that the Erzberger Reforms of 1919 (discussed above) had already raised tax burdens considerably. Increasing this burden posed the same political/social risks as cutting back on spending—i.e., any additional tax increases would not only prove immensely difficult to pass (the Erzberger Reforms themselves had been watered-down significantly by opposition in the Reichstag), but would also be likely to accelerate capital flight. Commenting on the impossibility of meeting the reparation burden through taxation, Keynes wrote "the whips and scorpions of any government recorded in history [would not have been] potent enough to extract nearly half…[the required] income from a people so situated."[61]

# Existing Savings Were Extremely Limited and Securing Lending in Sufficient Size Was Impossible

There were virtually no savings to draw on to service those debts. The Treaty of Versailles had essentially seized or frozen all of Germany's prewar foreign holdings and canceled all debts owed to Germans. Moreover, those with foreign currency savings (primarily exporters) were incentivized to keep their earnings in foreign bank accounts, precisely because they had reason to fear the reparations burden would encourage a government seizure of their wealth. As for the central bank's gold reserves, they were not enough to cover even the first interest payment.

Further, there was little appetite internationally to extend Germany credit on a scale that would allow it to spread out its reparation burden. This was for two reasons. First, most developed world economies were burdened by war debts of their own (primarily owed to the United States) and were also in the midst of severe recessions. Second, the German government (and most Germans) weren't creditworthy. For instance, when the head of the Reichsbank approached the Bank of England for a 500 million gold mark short-term loan to meet the second reparation installment, he was "politely refused."[62] According to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, "the difficulty was that there was a vicious circle. Germany said she could not stop the emission of paper money and repay her obligations unless she was able to raise a foreign loan, and she could not raise a foreign loan unless she could pay her obligations."[63]

Of course, defaulting on the debt unilaterally was impossible, because Germany had been threatened with an invasion. Though its leaders furiously and continuously tried to renegotiate the payments, bitter feelings from the war (which had ended just a couple of years earlier) made the victors, especially France, disinclined to make concessions.

Unlike a household facing a payment problem, a country can change the amount of existing currency, and by doing so affect its value. This gives it an additional lever to manage a balance of payments crisis. While the Reichsbank could try to defend the currency by raising rates and tightening credit, which would increase the returns on holding mark denominated assets/deposits for creditors, and thereby attract more capital from abroad while discouraging capital flight at home, it would also crush domestic demand, reduce imports, and help close the trade deficit. That would require an unimaginably severe contraction in consumption, which would have been intolerable for this already impoverished and conflict-ridden society to bear.

The only remaining alternative was to allow the currency to depreciate and print money to alleviate any potential tightening in liquidity that resulted from the flight of marks abroad.

As we noted in the template, the most important characteristic of cases that spiral into hyperinflation is that policy makers don't close the imbalance between income and spending/debt service; instead, they fund and keep funding spending over sustained periods of time by printing lots of money. Of course, some targeted money printing is typical in any balance of payments crisis—and, if not overused, is helpful, because it prevents the economic contraction from getting too severe. But when there is too much reflationary printing of money/monetization, and too severe a currency devaluation (which is deflationary) relative to the other levers for managing a deleveraging—especially the deflationary levers of austerity and debt restricting/default—the most severe inflationary depressions can and do occur.

The reparation schedule—and the extreme difficulty of using austerity, dissaving, external borrowing, and debt defaults as levers—pushed German policy makers to rely exclusively on money printing to manage the crisis. While policy makers knew this would contribute to inflation, they wagered that it would be the least terrible of their terrible choices. In my opinion, they made a mistake in not trying to achieve a better balance between deflationary forces and inflationary ones.

# June 1921-December 1921: The Emerging Inflationary Spiral

The second half of 1921 saw the classic dynamics of an inflationary spiral emerge. Germany's impossible set of foreign debt obligations was contributing to currency declines, which caused inflation and a liquidity crisis. The central bank provided liquidity by printing money and buying debt, rather than allowing commerce to deeply contract. This, in turn, triggered further rounds of capital flight, inflation, tightening liquidity, and money printing, so the spiral accelerated. In the midst of this, the central bank depleted a substantial portion of its gold reserves to cover the first reparation payments.

The spiral was still relatively contained compared to what was to come a year later, mainly as foreigners continued to support the German balance of payments by purchasing German assets. But reparation payments and local capital flight caused the mark to decline 75 percent over the period and inflation accelerated, approaching 100 percent per annum. The sharpest declines came in October 1921, following the League of Nation's decision to cede Upper Silesia (an important coal mining and industrial region) to Poland, despite a majority vote by its residents to remain in Germany.[64]

Rising inflation led to a surge in retail purchases. This pickup in demand was not a sign of increasing economic activity but rather a flight of income and savings into real goods before inflation could eat away at the purchasing power of money. The American Council of Hamburg spoke of a "vast amount of retail buying," while the Hamburgische Correspondent referred to a "monstrous lust for goods."[65] The situation soon came to be described as one of "general liquidation," because between foreigners buying a lot since the mark was cheap and Germans buying goods to escape inflation, the shelves in the shops were bare. A Berlin official reported shock at the "plundering of the retailers by foreigners with highly valued currencies," while a British observer lamented that "many shops declare themselves to be sold out; others close from 1 to 4 in the afternoon, and most of them refuse to sell more than one article of the same kind to each customer…Germans [are] laying in stores for fear of a further rise in prices or a total depletion of stocks."[66]

The same pressures led to a massive increase in consumer-durable and real-asset purchases. Auto sales climbed to all-time highs, the textile trade had bookings several months in advance, cotton firms refused to take new orders, and most industries found themselves operating at full capacity and having to introduce overtime to meet the growing demand for goods.[67] Once again, this burst of economic activity was not a sign of economic prosperity, but a classic flight into inflation-hedge assets. According to one Bavarian official:

"The fall of the mark…has brought a real anxiety among the propertied classes. Everyone seeks to do something with their money. Everything is bought that can be bought, not only for present need, not only for future use, but in order to get rid of the paper and have objects to exchange when the time comes that it is worth absolutely nothing."68

Erzberger's Death Fires All Germany

"Responsibility for the murder attaches to the Nationalist skirts. Its effect on the radical masses is bound to assert itself."

As the central bank kept market interest rates anchored at 5 percent (by increasing purchases when liquidity tightened), and as inflation was generally  $10\mathrm{x}$  higher, the real return on lending became very unattractive and the real cost of borrowing (i.e., real interest rates) plummeted.[69] This led to a surge in borrowing, which became extremely attractive.[70] As a result, real investment reached prewar highs[71] and monthly bankruptcy rates declined by 75 percent.[72] However, there was very little in this investment that was productive. Firms would push borrowed money into capital less for its "use value" than for its "intrinsic value." Firms that did not do this, and kept most of their wealth in debt assets (such as bonds), suffered devastating losses. This time was called the "flight from the mark to the machine"; it resulted in many excessive investments that performed poorly once the inflation had passed.[73] Of course, all of this accelerated inflation and reinforced the spiral.

Growing demand for real goods led to increasing employment in the industries that produced those goods.[74] So unemployment fell and workers' bargaining power increased as they pushed for wage increases and better working hours. In the summer of 1921, numerous standoffs between employers and laborers led to large nominal wage gains. However, these gains were not enough to keep up with inflation and workers still saw their real incomes fall by about 30 percent.[75] This made tensions between the "haves" and the "have-nots" even worse.

The only sector of the economy that saw some clear benefit from the collapse of the mark was the export sector. Foreign sales increased as German goods became cheaper on the international market. However, the pickup in exports was less than it ordinarily would have been, given such a large decline in the currency, for two reasons: First, there was considerable hostility to German exports abroad, even as they became cheaper, which limited the potential gains from a depreciating currency. Second, labor costs were also declining in the rest of the developed world, as a result of deflation from the severe global recession, limiting the potential competitiveness gains from the depreciating mark.

The second half of 1921 also saw what one commentator called "an orgy of speculation" in the stock market.[76] Stocks nearly tripled in value over the period (in inflation-adjusted terms) and in August the Berlin stock exchange was so overloaded with orders that it was forced to shut down three times a week. By November, operating days were reduced to just one day a week and banks refused to take orders for shares after 10 a.m. According to one newspaper, "Today there is no one—from lift-boy, typist, and small landlord to the wealthy lady in high society—who does not speculate in industrial securities and who does not study the list of official quotations as if it were a most precious letter."[77]

Once again, this bull market was not driven by improving economic fundamentals, or a more optimistic discounting of future economic conditions. It reflected a rush to get out of money or to get short money (i.e., borrow it) against a long "stuff" position. According to one observer:

"Stock market speculation today is the organized flight from the mark…at a time when the return on an investment diminishes in the same ratio as the value of the paper mark and when therefore even the solid capitalist, if he does not want to impoverish himself from day to day, must acquire real values. This alone has led to an extraordinary increase in the stock market business."[78]

By the end of 1921, deteriorating economic conditions, the absence of faith in the mark, and rapidly rising prices began to threaten an economic and/or political collapse. At the time, the inflation rate was nearing 100 percent. The only thing preventing a total collapse was the foreigners' willingness to continue to buy marks and fund Germany's massive external deficit (about 10 percent of GDP). As the chart below illustrates, despite the loss of confidence in the mark at home, many foreigners kept purchasing German assets at cheap prices.

Calls on Germany to Limit Paper Money:

Allied Board Plans Partial Moratorium

# January 1922-May 1922: Negotiating a Reparation Moratorium

Alarmed by the chaos in Germany, the Allied powers concluded that the German economy needed some relief from reparation payments.[79] This was encouraging because at this stage it was the reparation debt burden that was most crushing and most inescapable. Continuing with the status quo ran the risk of a total economic collapse, which would worsen the political chaos at the heart of Europe, while making it impossible to collect any reparation payments in the future. However, there remained considerable disagreement among the Allied powers as to the extent of such relief and what, if anything, Germany should be required to give in return.

Central to the matter was a tension between the desire for vengeance and the limitation of German power, and the recognition that economic realities dictated that some compromises be made. This flavor of debtor/creditor standoff is classic during deleveragings. Naturally, the debtors (i.e., Germans) demanded as much relief as they could get and the creditors (i.e., the Allied powers) tried to get as much money back as they could without plunging the debtor economy into insolvency. The game of power brinksmanship was played by all. Commenting on the dynamics at the time, J.P. Morgan, Jr. reportedly told a confidant:

"The Allies must make up their minds as to whether they wanted a weak Germany who could not pay, or a strong Germany who could pay. If they wanted a weak Germany they must keep her economically weak; but if they wanted her to be able to pay they must allow Germany to exist in a condition of cheerfulness, which would lead to successful business. This meant, however, that you would get a strong Germany, and a Germany that was strong economically would, in a sense, be strong from a military point of view also."80

The question of restructuring Germany's reparation payments was discussed at a conference in Cannes, France, in January 1922. A temporary compromise was reached under which the Reparations Commission reduced the debt service bill by 75 percent for the remainder of the year, provided Germany agreed to raise new taxes (including a forced loan of a billion gold marks on its wealthy citizens), reduced spending and money printing, and granted the Reichsbank formal independence from the government.[81] These concessions were mostly symbolic. The taxes agreed to were far too small to meaningfully close the budget deficit and the president of the Reichsbank, Rudolf Havenstein, said he welcomed more independence, as it would allow him to print as much money as was needed to ensure liquidity without constraints from fiscal policy makers.[82]

Renewed optimism about meaningful relief from reparations halted the mark's slide. By the end of January, it had risen 30 percent from its 1921 lows, and inflation, while remaining high (about 140 percent per annum), had stopped accelerating. The inflationary spiral was halted for now, providing much-needed relief to the German economy. As negotiations progressed, German policy makers pressed the Allies for additional concessions, arguing forcefully that it was the balance of payments, and not the central bank's money printing, that was ultimately responsible for the inflationary crisis. In a speech to the Reichstag on March 29, Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau told German lawmakers:

"Over and over again we encounter the notion that if the value of our money has been ruined this can only be because we have printed money. The recipe which we are given against this is: stop your printing press, bring your budget in order, and the misfortune is ended. A grave economic error!…[How is it possible] to make continuous gold payments without the help of foreign loans and at the same time keep the exchange rate intact? The attempt has never been made to give such a prescription and it cannot be given. For a country that does not produce gold cannot pay in gold unless it buys this gold with export surpluses [which Germany did not have] or unless it is borrowed [which Germany could not do]."[83]

As you can see, the mechanics of economics and markets were simple and basically the same then as they are now. While the central bank could easily extinguish its domestic currency denominated debt (in the ways previously described) it could not easily extinguish its external debts (for previously explained reasons).

From February until May, expectations surrounding the currency continued to be driven primarily by news of the reparation negotiations.[84] When news suggested there would be a comprehensive agreement, the mark rallied, and inflation expectations fell.[85] When new information suggested that an agreement was less likely, the mark fell and inflation expectations rose.[86] The mark experienced numerous 10 to 20 percent swings on such changes of sentiment, and by the end of May was down about 40 percent versus the dollar, as the prospects of a reparation agreement deteriorated.

The chart below gives a taste of how new pieces of information on the reparation negotiations led to major swings in the mark. As you can see from the below table, the markets chopped up and down in big moves every time there was essentially any update on reparation negotiations. Imagine having to trade through such volatility!

# June 1922-December 1922: Hyperinflation Begins

In June 1922, expectations of a reparation settlement collapsed, as did the mark. This was due to three interconnected events: First the French, who had always been the most reluctant among the Allied powers to reduce reparation burdens, declared they would no longer accept the conclusions of the

Reparation Commission regarding Germany's capacity to pay.[87] Rather, France would make its own determinations on what German reparations should be, and would seize German assets, particularly some of its most productive assets (i.e., the coal mines in the Ruhr), if Germany defaulted.[88] Instead of a possible moratorium, Germany would now have to pay France whatever the French thought was appropriate, or risk a sustained occupation of some of its most valuable territory.

The French declaration also undermined an additional plan to support the German economy. An international committee had been established, headed by the American financier JP Morgan, Jr., to investigate the possibility of extending Germany a gold loan to rebuild its economy and ease the burden of external debt. However, this loan was contingent on progress on a reparation moratorium, for without it such a loan could almost certainly not be paid back. Following the French declaration, the loan committee was forced to conclude that extending credit to Germany was impossible.[89]

Finally, on June 24, Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau was assassinated by a right-wing group. Rathenau, despite some of his belligerent speeches, was one of the few German politicians who was trusted by the Allied powers and enjoyed significant support at home.[90] If there was anyone who could mediate a settlement with the Reparations Commission and get it through the Reichstag, it was Rathenau. Of course, this also illustrates the threat of nationalism and extremist populism that was hanging over Germany.

# Unlike earlier, foreigners now rushed to pull their capital from Germany.

As noted previously, about a third of all deposits in German banks were foreign-owned, and foreign speculation had been a huge source of support for the German economy and balance of payments. Over the next few months, about two thirds of these deposits disappeared and capital inflows collapsed.[91] Simultaneously, capital flight of Germans wanting to get out accelerated; well-to-do citizens rushed to get their wealth out before the confiscatory taxes agreed to in the January compromise came into effect. The mark collapsed and hyperinflation began.

The result was an acute liquidity crisis in the German banking system that led to runs on the banks. The rate of central bank printing was no longer fast enough to keep up with the flight of marks abroad and rising prices. By July, banks were forced to go on three-day work weeks, and had to inform their depositors that they did not have enough cash on hand to either honor their deposits or make weekly wage payments for their large business clients.[92] Some even began printing their own marks, which was illegal. The liquidity crisis was self-reinforcing. Depositors, seeing that the banks were struggling to honor their liabilities, began withdrawing their deposits in ever-growing numbers, which only made the liquidity crisis worse.

By August 1922, the economy was on the brink of financial collapse. The central bank was forced to respond by rapidly accelerating the pace at which it was printing marks and monetizing a growing share of government debt.

The central bank also began purchasing commercial bills en masse. As the liquidity crisis deepened in the fall, it additionally accelerated its provision of direct credits to the banking system. By the end of the year, the Reichsbank would end up holding about one third of all commercial bills in circulation and would have increased its credits to the banking system by 1,900 percent.[93] Such interventions helped prevent the financial system from collapsing, and led to a ten-fold increase in the money supply.

Unlike past bouts of currency depreciation and money printing, in which inflation would pick up substantially but never enter hyperinflation territory, this round of currency depreciation and money printing sent inflation skyrocketing. Part of this was due to the scale of the liquidity injection that was needed to offset the pullback in foreign capital, but part of it was also due to changing inflationary psychology. While most people had believed that inflation was being semi-managed, now most believed it was out of control.

In inflationary depressions, it is classic that with each round of printing, more money leaves the currency instead of going into economic activity. As domestic currency holders see that investors that short cash (i.e., borrow in the weakening currency) and buy real/foreign assets are repeatedly better off than those who save and invest at home, they increasingly catch on and shift from investing printed money in productive assets to purchasing real assets (like gold) and foreign currency. Foreign investors no longer return because they have been repeatedly burned.

As early as August, with prices rising by over 50 percent a month and accelerating, policy makers recognized that they were approaching a hyperinflationary spiral, but they felt they had no alternative but to continue printing.[94] Why didn't they stop?

Once an inflationary depression reaches the hyperinflationary stage, it is extremely difficult to stop printing. This is because when extreme capital flight and extreme inflation feed off one another, money becomes harder to come by, even as it loses its worth. When Keynes visited Hamburg in the summer of 1922, still in the early phase of the hyperinflation, he vividly described the phenomenon:

"The prices in the shops change every hour. No one knows what this week's wages will buy at the end of the week. The mark is at the same time valueless and scarce. On the one hand, the shops do not want to receive marks, and some of them are unwilling to sell at any price at all. On the other hand…the banks were so short of ready cash that the Reichsbank advised them to cash no checks for more than 10,000 marks…and some of the biggest institutions were unable to cash their customers' checks for payment of weekly wages."95

To stop printing would result in an extreme shortage of cash and bring about a total collapse of the financial system and all commerce. As one economist noted at the time:

[To stop the printing press] would mean that in a very short time the entire public, and above all the Reich, could no longer pay merchants, employees, or workers. In a few weeks, besides the printing of notes, factories, mines, railways and post office, national and local government, in short, all national and economic life would be stopped.[96]

People tend to think that hyperinflations are caused by central banks recklessly printing too much money, and all they need to do to stop it is to turn off the printing press. If it were that easy, hyperinflations would almost never occur! Instead, inflation spirals push policy makers into circumstances where printing is the least bad of several terrible options.

In the case of Weimar Germany, the cost of not printing was not only potential economic collapse, but political fragmentation. France's repeated threats to occupy German territory if reparations were not paid made halting the printing press an invitation to a foreign invasion. It also lowered hopes for productive reparations negotiations. As one prominent industrialist put it at the time:

"The Reichsbank can no more stop inflation than the Burgermeister of Hamburg can tell the patients in the hospital to stop being ill…as long as it is possible for the French to invade Germany, there can be no talk of a stabilization of our currency."97

By September, Germany was trapped in a classic hyperinflationary spiral. Extreme capital withdrawals and rapidly rising prices were forcing the central bank to choose between extreme illiquidity and printing money at an accelerating rate. As doing the former would result in a total collapse in business activity, there was really no choice. However, as the money supply grew, no one wanted to hold it in such a depreciating environment. The velocity of money accelerated, triggering even more capital flight, money printing, and inflation, and so on and so forth.

You can see this relationship most vividly in the chart below—which must be shown in logarithmic terms due to the exponential growth rates in inflation and the money supply. As you can see, currency weakness was leading inflation, which was leading money supply growth—not the other way around. Reckless money printing was less the cause of the hyperinflation than what was required to prevent massive deflationary defaults by banks (and just about everyone else) and a deflationary economic collapse.

Remember that money and credit serve two purposes: As a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth. As the spiral accelerated, the mark completely lost its status as a store hold of value. People rushed to exchange it for any available alternative—real goods, foreign exchange, and capital equipment. Very soon, exponential rates of inflation made it impractical to trade in marks, so the currency also began to lose its status as a means of

exchange. Foreign currencies (especially the dollar) and even makeshift currencies became increasingly common in day-to-day transactions and price quotations. For instance, local branches of the Reichsbank found that they did not have enough actual paper notes for businesses to meet their payroll obligations.[98] So, the central bank and the finance ministry allowed some large depositors to print their own currencies. These were called Notgeld—which literally means "emergency money."[99] Soon, everyone began considering whether the mark would go extinct.

According to the Frankfurter Zeitung, by October 1922:

"German economic life is… dominated by a struggle over the survival of the mark: is it to remain the German currency, or is it doomed to extinction? During the past few months foreign currencies have replaced it as units of account in domestic transactions to a wholly unforeseen extent. The habit of reckoning in dollars, especially, has established itself, not only in firms' internal accounting practice, but above all as the method of price quotation in trade, industry and agriculture."100

In a desperate attempt to calm the inflationary spiral, on October 12 1922, the government stepped in to stop the ever-growing flight into foreign currency. Restrictions were put on German citizens purchasing foreign FX.[101] Such capital controls are a classic lever to control inflationary depressions; they are rarely successful. The reasons for this are that a) capital controls have limited effectiveness at best because they are usually pretty easy to get around and b) trying to trap people typically leads them to want to escape even more. Not being able to get one's money out of the country triggers a psychology that is analogous to the inability to get one's money out of a bank: it produces fear that produces a run.

The stock market was one of the few remaining domestic escapes from the inflation. After declining 50 percent (in real terms) since June, stocks actually rallied in the second half of October—but like the fall of 1921, this rally had nothing to do with underlying economic conditions or the future prospects of the economy. In fact, in the fall of 1922, real profit margins were collapsing as the chaos of the hyperinflation hit productivity.[102] The rally was also extremely small in the context of the overall real stock market decline during the debt crisis.

See the charts below and imagine living through these conditions.

# January 1923-August 1923: The Occupation of the Ruhr and the Final Days of Inflation

In January 1923, with the economy already in chaos and prompted by Germany missing a promised delivery of timber as a reparation payment, a French-Belgian force invaded Germany and occupied the Ruhr (Germany's primary industrial region). The French hoped that this action would pressure Germany to pay reparations more cooperatively and in the meantime allow France to extract payments in coal. The Germans responded by declaring "passive resistance."[103] Miners in the Ruhr would strike in an attempt to make the occupation as costly as possible for the French government. However, this resistance would need to be subsidized by the Reich, as both the miners and their employers would have to be paid. It also meant that about half of the country's coal supply would need to be imported, adding additional strain on the balance of payments.[104] As a result, government spending increased, the balance of payments deteriorated, liquidity shortages pushed the Reichsbank to print even more, and inflation, which was already at astronomical levels, accelerated even more.

France's aggression left an opening for Germany in the reparation negotiations, as the occupation of a country approaching economic ruin was widely denounced. To buy time, the Reichsbank began issuing dollar denominated debt (at a considerable discount to international prices due to its credit risk) in order to buy marks—with the central bank targeting a peg against the dollar. Between January and June of 1923, the Reichsbank sold about 400 million gold marks of borrowed foreign exchange and central bank reserves to defend the mark's peg against the dollar. The central bank also raised rates to 18 percent (but given that inflation was running at close to 10,000 percent this was mostly a symbolic move).[105] According to the president of the Reichsbank:

"The intervention did not…have as its purpose the permanent and final stabilization of the mark. Such an undertaking will only become possible when the reparations problem is seriously brought to a solution. What it had as its purpose was…to recover for the German economy…as long as possible…a time of somewhat calm…to free the market from wild and unscrupulous speculation and to protect the German people from a further rapid price increase which would have exhausted it."106

The FX intervention halted the mark's slide (it actually appreciated by 50 percent for the first three months of the intervention) and introduced a brief period of deflation that certainly hurt the shorts.[107] However, by May it became clear that the Reichsbank did not have the reserves to pay out dollar denominated principal and interest payments and maintain the peg, so the fixed exchange rate policy was abandoned six months after it was put in place and hyperinflation returned stronger than before (reaching 36,000,000,000 percent by November 1923).[108]

Now the German economy found itself burdened by an additional stock of hard currency debt, and the French reaffirmed their commitment to stay in the Ruhr as long as was necessary to get what they were owed. Throughout the summer, some sporadic interventions in the FX market were attempted, but none were able to curb inflation or prevent the downward spiral in the exchange rate.[109] Around this time, the president of the Reich asked his finance minister to find new measures "to avert the complete collapse of our mark." The finance minister replied "the complete collapse of the mark is already underway."[110]

Living through such chaos was immensely painful and traumatizing for me.

German citizens—and experiences of the inflation would later serve to validate many of the criticisms made by Nazi politicians of the "disastrous" Weimar era.

# Late 1923 to 1924: Ending the Hyperinflation

By late 1923, the hyperinflation had created intolerably painful conditions within Germany. Unemployment was rising rapidly, inflation was well above 1,000,000 percent, real tax revenues were diminishing at an alarming rate,[112] food was growing scarce, and transacting with marks had become almost impossible.[113] Without an effective means of exchange, the economic machine of the nation had ground to a halt. The resulting suffering stunned people of all walks of life. As one local mayor put it, "I have never encountered such hordes of people starving and wandering about."[114] And all recognized that the crisis would soon boil over into mass riots or revolution.[115] Rudolf Wissell, who would later serve as Germany's minister of labor, captured the prevailing sentiment of the period: "The inflation in which we find ourselves at this time is murdering the Republic. It will be the gravedigger of our Republic."[116]

The Allied powers concluded that without substantial reparation relief, German policy makers would remain helpless to avert a total collapse of the economy. So, in November 1923 they suspended reparations payments and reopened negotiations with the Germans on restructuring the debt.[117] This gave German policy makers the breathing room they needed.

German policy makers took five crucial steps to curb inflation, each following logically from the last:

NaN. To offload the reparations burden that started the crisis in the first place, policy makers renegotiated payments with the Allies, eventually reducing the debt service burdens to just 1 percent of GDP. With the crippling reparation burden made more manageable…

NaN….A new currency was introduced, the rentenmark, which was backed by gold-denominated assets and land and pegged to the dollar. However, as the new currency could fail if investors believed that it would be used to monetize debt payments…

NaN….Strict limits were placed on the amount of rentenmarks that could be printed and the amount of debt that could be monetized. However, a central bank can only credibly avoid monetizing debt if the government can pay its bills, so…

NaN….The German government took action to raise its revenues and cut its expenditures, making deep, extremely painful cuts. Similarly, the central bank capped the amount they would loan to businesses and raised borrowing rates. To further build faith in the new currency…

NaN….The central bank built up large reserves of foreign currency assets. They were able to do this by borrowing foreign exchange from the Allies and encouraging German citizens who had fled the currency during the hyperinflation to repatriate their savings.

Earlier one-off measures (e.g., the short-lived currency peg, capital controls) hadn't been enough—Germany needed a comprehensive and aggressive policy shift that abolished the currency, accepted hard backing, and placed extreme limits on monetization, credit creation, and government spending. It helped that years of economic crisis had made the public eager to find a currency that they could actually use. However, none of this would have been possible if the

German 'Rentenbank' Ready for Business: First Step in the Government's Efforts at Currency Reform reparation burden was not substantially reduced. After all, why would any investor or saver want to hold German currency if they knew the government had huge external liabilities it could not pay?

Below, we walk through each of these measures in detail, moving roughly chronologically.

# 1) Restructuring the Reparations Debt

Although the process of negotiating with the Allies was slow, drawn out, and painful, some critical concessions were secured very early that provided the breathing room that was necessary to implement the policy changes that ended the hyperinflation.[118] Without reparation relief, the structural drivers of the inflation would have remained intact, and it would have been highly unlikely that any new currency could have commanded faith as a store hold of wealth.

Significant progress came as early as September 1923, when German industrialists in the Ruhr began to cooperate with the Weimar government in its negotiations with the French.[119] These industrial magnates had long resisted any concessions to France when it came to reparations payments, but as conditions continued to deteriorate and workers began to riot, they recognized the need for diplomacy, and eventually agreed to resume coal transfers.[120] By mid-October, the Weimar government was able to completely end its financial support of "passive resistance" to the Ruhr occupation, both opening the way for progress in talks with the French and eliminating one of its largest expenses.[121]

The Weimar government quickly built on the progress it had made in the Ruhr. By the end of November, British and French negotiators had created a new committee—the Dawes committee—to review and potentially reduce Germany's reparations obligations.[122] Critically, the committee agreed to suspend reparations payments until it came to its final conclusions—making it far easier for Germany to balance its budget during the stabilization period.[123] For the next 10 months, Germany did not have to make a single hard currency payment to the reparations commission. Moreover, when the Dawes Plan came into full force in August 1924, it significantly and permanently eased Germany's reparations burden.[124] Payments were rescheduled, and debt service costs reduced, to the point that reparations payments amounted to only one percent of German GNP in 1924 and 1925—a reduction of over 90 percent versus 1923.[125]

Although Germany would still have to pay the full 130 billion gold marks of reparations, payments were now so spread out that it was possible to meet them. The chart below gives some perspective on how significant this shift was by comparing what Germany could have been asked to pay at any moment between 1921 and 1923 (if the Allies had demanded Germany begin paying down the full reparation bill), what they actually had to pay between 1921 and 1923 (i.e., the London Schedule, under which some payments were suspended until the Allies thought Germany was capable of paying them), what debt service payments look like leading into the typical inflationary deleveraging, and what Germany had to pay after reparation payments were restricted in 1924 (i.e., the Dawes Plan). As you can see, the Dawes Plan dramatically reduced the FX debt service burden.

# 2) Creating a New Currency

Creating a new currency with very hard backing is the most classic path that countries suffering from inflationary deleveragings follow in order to end them. In the Weimar case, this currency replacement process came in roughly three stages, beginning in August 1923 and ending in October 1924.[126]

The first steps toward replacing the mark were disorganized and reactive, driven by necessity rather than by any definite plan. By the summer of 1923, transacting in the mark had become so difficult that major institutions within Germany turned to alternatives, even though these had their own flaws.[127] Many resorted to using foreign exchange in place of domestic currency. From late 1922 onward, most major industries in Germany began to set prices in foreign currencies, and by 1923 much of the wholesale trade within Germany was conducted directly in dollars, francs, or florins.[128] Those who could not access foreign currency turned

to "emergency money" as a last resort. These emergency bills were issued by local governments, trade associations, or companies, and were usually at least theoretically backed by real assets.[129] This emergency money, though often illegal, was easier to use than the paper mark, and by the fall of 1923, nearly 2,000 types of it were actively circulating in Germany.[130]

Recognizing the need for a currency with a stable value, the government attempted to give a stamp of authority to this informal system. Specifically, in August 1923 it began issuing very small-denomination debt, indexed to dollars, which it hoped would be used as a temporary currency until a better solution could be found.[131] These "Gold Loan" bills could either be circulated directly or used as a more secure backing for other emergency currencies.[132] And, though they were ultimately backed by nothing more than a stamp claiming they were "wertbestandig" (stable value) and a promise that the government could "raise supplements to the tax on capital" in order to honor them, they did retain their value.[133] In fact, the public was so desperate for a reliable store of wealth that the gold loan bills tended to be hoarded rather than used, and they disappeared almost entirely from circulation shortly after being issued.[134]

The second phase of the transition to a new currency began on October 15, 1923, when the government announced the creation of a new national bank—the Rentenbank—and a new stable-value currency, the rentenmark, which would enter circulation on November 15.[135] Unlike previous efforts to create a currency with "stable value," the more ambitious rentenmark scheme was an immediate, "miraculous" success.[136] Crucially, since rentenmarks could be exchanged for either a fixed quantity of paper marks or a fixed quantity of hard assets (and vice versa), the hard backing behind the rentenmark applied not only to newly issued bills (as had been the case with the gold loan bills), but to all of the paper marks already in circulation. Specifically, the rentenmark was pegged to the paper mark at a ratio of one to one trillion, and to the dollar at a ratio of 4.2 to one—a symbolically significant exchange rate, as it set the gold value of the rentenmark equal to that of the pre-war, peace-time mark.[137]

In the months that followed, both of these pegged rates held, and by December both the rentenmark and the newly-pegged paper mark were trading at par in foreign markets, while inflation had fallen to sustainable levels.[138]

# 3) Imposing Limits on Money Printing

The key to the new currency's lasting success was that the Rentenbank issued relatively little of it and convincingly backed its issues with real assets. At the same time, there weren't large debts denominated in it—the total amount of credit the Rentenbank could extend was capped at 2.4 billion marks.[139] And, unlike the old gold loan bills, rentenmarks were directly secured by mortgages on 5 percent of all German agricultural and industrial property ("renten" refers to the annuities paid on these mortgages).[140] Even more important than this direct backing was the implicit security provided by the Reichsbank's gold reserves. By 1923 the real value of the money supply had been so reduced by the popular flight from paper marks that it could be backed entirely by the government's reserves.[141] This reduction in the value of circulating currency was reinforced as the Reichsbank began cracking down on illegal emergency money following the introduction of the rentenmark and withdrew its gold loan bills from circulation.[142]

As shown on the chart below, the monetary base in dollars had fallen to equal Germany's gold reserves by 1923.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/a73a56d2a179ad6c4365aceccc299c163de0374e091ea4a96327aacf5f0146a5.jpg)

After a year of relative stability, German policy makers implemented the third phase of the currency transition. On October 11, 1924, they introduced another new hard currency (the reichsmark), which could be purchased with rentenmarks at a one to one ratio. Unlike the rentenmark, which had only been formally backed by mortgage bonds, the new reichsmark could be exchanged directly for bullion at the Reichsbank. Specifically, it could be converted into precisely the same quantity of gold as the pre-war mark.[143] All remaining paper marks were withdrawn from circulation by June 5, 1925, while the old currency (the rentenmark) was gradually phased out over the next decade.[144]

But as we will see, it took much more than a new currency to create a lasting stabilization. The rentenmark and reichsmark were crucial pieces of the reform process, but they weren't the only pieces. Currency depends on the credibility of the institutions issuing it. The fact that there were not a lot of promises to deliver currency (i.e., not a lot of debt denominated in the new currencies) meant that the central bank was not in the position of having to choose between inflationary monetization of debt and deflationary defaults on it. And the fact that the amount of the currency was limited to the amount of backing behind it meant it could be kept stable. The Rentenbank faced a difficult challenge as it attempted to gain credibility in the fall of 1923, but it succeeded because its fundamentals were solid.

# 4) Ending Monetization

In order to build confidence in a new currency, countries in inflationary deleveragings need to stop monetizing debt. As long as the government can force the central bank to print to cover its liabilities, there is a risk that the new currency will be debased and its supposedly hard backing abandoned. That is one of the reasons it is important that central banks be independent of the political system.

Reassurance that monetization would stop came in the form of two major announcements—one initially private and one quite public. First, on August 18, 1923, the Reichsbank informed the Weimar government that, beginning in 1924, it would not discount any additional government debt.[145] Though this memo was private, it quickly circulated among the industrial elite, and it spurred policy makers to seriously reconsider the need for fiscal reforms.[146] The second piece of reassuring news came on October 15, 1923, when central bank officials publicly stated that the new Rentenbank would cap total government credits (in this case at 1.2 billion rentenmarks). Additionally, its new policy would forbid the Reichsbank from monetizing any government debt after November 15.[147]

For a time, both the public and the government itself doubted that the central bank and the Rentenbank would honor these promises. After all, the Rentenbank lent the government the entirety of its 1.2 billion rentenmark allocation almost immediately.[148] And, by December 1923, the government had already requested an additional 400 million rentenmarks.[149] When officials at the Rentenbank stood firm, however, they successfully signaled the beginning of a new era of central bank independence—and the end of a long period of unchecked monetization.

# 5) Closing the Deficit

When the central bank stops monetizing debts during an inflationary deleveraging, the government can either find new creditors to finance its deficits, close those deficits, or take control over the central bank and continue monetizing debt. Since finding new creditors is usually impossible in an inflationary deleveraging, and monetizing debt only postpones the problem, the budget ultimately needs to be balanced.

By late 1923, the Weimar regime had come to the conclusion that it needed to close the deficits. There was no choice, and with the debts largely relieved, this was now possible. In the words of the German minister of finance, "If we do not succeed in cutting loose from the inflationary economy through ruthless choking off of Reich expenditures, then the only prospect we have is general chaos."[150]

The government had run budget deficits since the outbreak of the war in 1914.[151] However, in August 1923, the government took steps to address the problem by indexing certain taxes to inflation and passing additional emergency taxes.[152] By October, it had indexed all taxes to inflation.[153]

Additionally, the government took aggressive measures to reduce expenses, dismissing 25 percent of its employees and cutting the salaries of the remainder by 30 percent.[154] The Weimar regime ended its expensive subsidies to workers engaged in "passive resistance" in the Ruhr.[155] Such austerity was extremely painful, and would have been almost impossible to stomach a year or two before. But the hyperinflation had caused so much suffering and chaos by the end of 1923 that the German public was willing to do almost anything to bring prices back under control.

Most important, though, was the effect of more gradual inflation and a more stable exchange rate on the yield of existing taxes.[156] Temporary stabilization created a virtuous cycle of sorts: by reducing the rate of inflation, the stabilization increased real tax receipts, helping reduce budget strains and increasing the public's confidence in the government's ability to avoid future monetization. Following the introduction of the rentenmark in November, real tax receipts increased rapidly, rising from about 15 million gold marks in October 1923 to more than 300 million in December 1923.[157]

By January 1924, the government was running a surplus.[158]

# 6) Tightening Credit

Officials decided to significantly tighten access to credit, so private credit wouldn't add to inflationary pressures. This tightening was implemented through two channels. First, the government announced in February 1924 that it would "revalue" some privately held debts (i.e., require debtors to give creditors more than face value).[159] These included mortgages, bank deposits, and industrial debentures whose values had fallen to almost nothing during the hyperinflation.[160] Although the policy was implemented to appease angry creditors, it also worked as a tightening.[161] Just as debt reductions have the effect of easing credit, weakening the currency, and increasing inflation, debt revaluations tighten credit, support currencies, and lower inflation.

Second—and more significantly—on April 7 1924, the Reichsbank decided to cap the total amount of credit it would extend to the private sector. It wouldn't call back any existing debt, but it would extend new credit only as prior debts were paid off.[162] This strict cap on new credit creation was painful for businesses in the short term, but it also meaningfully stabilized German inflation, which turned slightly negative in May 1924.[163]

# 7) Accumulating Foreign Exchange Reserves

Though all the programs, policies, and agreements described above put the German economy on progressively firmer footing, not everyone was convinced they would ensure a permanent stabilization. In fact, as Germany implemented its stabilization regime between November 1923 and October 1924, speculators continually bet against the mark.[164] As long as Germany lacked a meaningful foreign exchange reserve, these speculative attacks remained a threat to its continued stability.

Two major shifts helped restore Germany's depleted foreign exchange reserves. The first was the transfer of privately held foreign currencies to the Reichsbank. As institutions and individuals within Germany gained increasing confidence in the new rentenmark as a means of exchange, they began to convert the foreign currency they had hoarded during the hyperinflation into new bills.[165] Between November 1923 and January 1924 alone, foreign exchange holdings at the Reichsbank grew from about 20 million gold marks to nearly 300 million.[166] Though these foreign exchange flows paused as inflation rose in early 1924 (and individuals began accumulating foreign currencies again), they resumed once credit standards within Germany were tightened and inflation stabilized (as described above).[167]

The second major shift came through the Dawes Plan. In addition to reducing reparations burdens, the Dawes Committee also extended Germany a significant foreign exchange loan.[168] The loan, issued in October 1924, amounted to 800 million gold marks worth of foreign currency, divided mainly between dollars, pounds, and francs.[169] Though the amount was not extraordinarily large, it meaningfully improved the Reichsbank's credibility when it came to defending against speculative attacks.[170] It also sent a reassuring signal to foreign investors. In the four years following the implementation of the Dawes Plan, American investors poured money into German debt, attracted by its relatively high yields.[171]

By 1924, the crisis was largely over. Germany would enter a brief period of recovery before the Great Depression hit it hard a decade later. This second crisis was not only economically devastating but fueled the rise of right wing and left wing populists, Hitler's rise to power, and all that followed. But that's another story.

Since the gold-denominated mortgage bonds that backed the rentenmark paid 5 percent, while market interest rates for stable-value loans were much higher, these mortgages traded below par. The "real" exchange value of the rentenmark, therefore, was well below its par value.

# US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928-1937)

# US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928-1937)

This section gives a detailed account of the big US debt cycle of the 1920s and 1930s, including the Great Depression, which is probably the most iconic case of a deflationary deleveraging. It takes you through the particulars of the case with reference to the template laid out earlier in the "Archetypal Big Debt Cycle." Though the Great Depression happened nearly a century ago, its dynamic was basically the same as what occurred in and around 2008. As with the other cases in this part, I both describe the timeline (which in this case is based on the library of books I've amassed on the Great Depression over the years rather than my personal experience trading through it) and provide a real-time "newsfeed" drawn from newspaper headlines and what the Federal Reserve was saying at the time that runs along the sides of the pages.

# 1927-1929: The Bubble

Following the world war and the recession of 1920 to 1921, the US economy experienced a period of rapid technology-led growth. The continuing electrification of rural and small-town America and the growth of the middle class opened up huge markets for new technologies. The radio was the new, hot technology and the number of radio sets owned grew from 60,000 in 1922 to 7.5 million in 1928. The automobile industry also grew rapidly and by 1929 there were 23 million cars on the road—on average, about one per every five Americans (which was nearly three times higher than in 1920). Technological advances also led to a productivity boom (factory worker output per hour increased 75 percent from 1922 to 1928). Technology breakthroughs filled the newspapers, driving wide-spread optimism about the economy.

In the midst of that technology boom, the early part of the cycle (roughly from 1922 to 1927) saw strong economic growth and subdued inflation. The broader period became known as the "fat years," as both capitalists and workers experienced significant gains. Corporate profits rose to postwar highs, unemployment dropped to postwar lows, and real wages rose more than 20 percent. In the pre-bubble years of 1923 to 1926, debt growth was appropriately in line with income growth because it was being used to finance activities that produced fast income growth. At the same time, the stock market roared higher while experiencing little volatility—investors in US

Sees United States Wiping Out Poverty

"Secretary Hoover's report of economic gains since 1921 means not that prosperity has come to the bulk of the American people but that widespread poverty, which has persisted among all peoples through all the ages, may soon be abolished in the United States, according to Professor Irving Fisher, Yale economist, in a copyrighted article made public for tomorrow."

-New York Times stocks made over 150 percent between the start of 1922 and the end of 1927. The hottest tech stocks at the time—Radio Corporation of America (known to traders as "Radio") and General Motors—led the gains.

Then a bubble began to emerge. As is classic, the bubble had its roots in the dizzying productivity and technological gains of the period and people making leveraged bets that they would continue. One writer explained the growing belief that the economy had entered a "New Era": "The New Era… meant permanent prosperity, an end to the old cycle of boom and bust, steady growth in the wealth and savings of the American people, [and] continuously rising stock prices."5

The US was an extremely attractive destination for investment from abroad. The US and most of the rest of the world were on a gold standard at the time, which meant governments promised to exchange their money for gold at a fixed exchange rate in order to provide assurance to lenders that they wouldn't just print a lot of money and devalue lenders' claims. Gold flowed from other countries to the US, because that was effectively how investors bought dollars. This played an important role in determining how events transpired during the lead-up to the crash in 1929, but we won't get into that now.

When other countries (France, Germany, and the UK) became worried that they were losing gold too quickly, they asked the US Federal Reserve to lower dollar interest rates to make dollars less attractive. More focused on growth and inflation than on the debt growth that was being used to buy financial assets, in the spring of 1927, the Federal Reserve Board cut its discount rate from 4 percent to 3.5 percent. This, of course, had the knock-on effect of encouraging US credit creation. This is a typical way that central banks inadvertently finance bubbles.

The economy accelerated in response to the easing, and news of the strong economy filled headlines and radio broadcasts nationwide. Over the second half of 1928, industrial production rose 9.9 percent and automobile production hit an all-time high. The boom made people euphoric. At the start of 1929, *The Wall Street Journal* described the pervasive strength of the US economy: "One cannot recall when a new year was ushered in with business conditions sounder than they are today…Everything points to full production of industry and record-breaking traffic for railroads."[6]

The easing by the Federal Reserve also produced a bull market in stocks that showed every sign of a classic bubble. I'll repeat my defining characteristics of a bubble:

1. Prices are high relative to traditional measures
2. Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels
3. There is broad bullish sentiment
4. Purchases are being financed by high leverage
5. Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g., built inventory, contracted forward purchases, etc.) to speculate or protect themselves against future price gains
6. New buyers (i.e., those who weren't previously in the market) have entered the market
7. Stimulative monetary policy helps inflate the bubble, and tight policy contributes to its popping

After prices nearly doubled over 1927 and 1928, stocks sold at extremely high multiples financed by borrowing (i.e., margin). Many stocks were valued as much as 30 times earnings. The popular book New Levels in the Stock Market, published in 1929 by Ohio State professor Charles Amos Dice, captured the pervasive sentiments of the bull market. He argued that the broader base of investors in the market made higher valuations more or less permanent, proclaiming, "Among the yardsticks for predicting the behavior of stocks which have been rendered obsolete…[is] the truism that what goes up must come down."

New buyers flooded the market, and many of them were unsophisticated investors with no prior experience with stocks, one of the classic signs of a bubble. Brokerage firms rapidly expanded to cater to aspiring speculators across the country; the number of branch offices outside of Wall Street increased by more than 50 percent between 1928 and 1929.[9] "Wherever one went," a broker declared in 1929, "one met people who told of their stock-market winnings. At dinner tables, at bridge, on golf links, on trolley cars, in country post offices, in barber shops, in factories and shops of all kinds."[10]

During this period, stock purchases were financed by high and rapidly increasing leverage, and more and more of this leverage occurred outside the regulated and protected banking system. Classically, new and fast-growing lending markets where a lot of levering up occurs are symptomatic of bubbles. Often, banks are able to make these new assets seem safe to investors via guarantees, or through the way the assets are combined and packaged—and without a crisis to stress-test them, it can be hard to tell how safe they actually are. These "innovations" typically lead to the next crisis if not monitored, understood, and managed by regulators. The bankers and the speculators made a lot of fast money in a symbiotic relationship (i.e., the bankers would lend to the speculators at fat spreads and the speculators would buy stocks on leverage, pushing them up and making money). In 1929, call loans and investment trusts were the fastest-growing channels for increasing leverage outside the banking system.[11]

The call loan market, a relatively new innovation, developed into a huge channel through which investors could access margin debt. The terms of call loans adjusted each day to reflect market interest rates and margin requirements, and lenders could "call" the money at any time, given the one-day term. Call loans created asset/liability mismatches among lenders and borrowers, since borrowers were using short-term debt to fund the purchases of risky long-term assets, and lenders were lending to riskier borrowers who were willing to pay higher interest rates. One of the classic ingredients of a debt crisis is the squeezing of lenders and borrowers who have debt/liability mismatches that they took on during the bubble.

Stock Prices Break Heavily as Money Soars to 14 percent

"Tightening on the strings of the country's supply of credit, a development foreshadowed last week, but not considered seriously by speculators in the stock market, brought about yesterday one of the sharpest declines in securities that has ever taken place on the Exchange. Only twice in the history of the Exchange have there been broader breaks."

-New York Times

A new group of investors entered the call loan market to lend to the crowd of speculators. Because interest rates on call loans were higher than other short-term rates and lenders could "call" back their money on demand, call loans became popular as a safe place for companies to invest their extra cash.[12]

Foreign capital also poured in from places like London and Hong Kong. As a historian later described it, "A great river of gold began to converge on Wall Street, all of it to help Americans hold common stock on margin."[13] The share of funds in the call loan market that were coming from lenders outside the Federal Reserve System (i.e., non-banks and foreigners) rose from 24 percent at the start of 1928 to 58 percent in October 1929.[14] This added risk to the market, since the Federal Reserve couldn't lend to these non-banks if they needed liquidity in a squeeze.

The charts below show the explosion in margin debt through the bubble and the accompanying rise in prices.

Investment trusts were another financial innovation that saw rapid growth during the bubble and helped draw new speculators into the market. First originated and popularized in Great Britain, investment trusts were companies that issued shares and invested the proceeds in the shares of other companies.[15] The well-known economist Irving Fisher praised the "wide and well-managed diversification" that trusts provided investors who lacked sufficient capital to buy shares in multiple companies.[16] As the stock market boomed, the number of trusts exploded. By 1929, new trusts were launching at a rate of nearly five per week, and these offerings were taking in one-third of the new capital raised.[17]

Number of US Investment Trusts Founded by Year

Promoters of trusts claimed that their diversification made the financial system safer. However, the use of leverage by many trusts to amplify returns in the bubble created risk for investors. And many speculators, unaware of the nature of the securities and believing that the recent past would continue, amplified this risk by taking out margin loans to lever up already-levered trust shares.[18]

As stock prices soared, speculators continued to lever up and make huge profits, attracting more buyers into the market to do the same. The more prices increased, the more aggressively speculators bet that they would increase still more.

At the same time, supplies of stocks were increasing as the higher prices encouraged their production.[19] During this phase of the bubble, the more prices went up, the more credit standards were lowered (even though it would have been logical for the opposite to happen), as both lenders and borrowers found lending and buying stocks with borrowed money to be very profitable.

The leveraging was mostly taking place in the "shadow banking" system; banks at the time by and large did not look over-leveraged. In June 1929 banks looked much healthier than they had prior to the 1920-1921 recession: not only were they posting record earnings, their capital ratios were higher (17.2 percent versus 14.9 percent) and their liabilities were stickier, as time deposits made up a greater share of their liabilities (35.7 percent versus 23.3 percent). A series of large bank mergers during 1929 were viewed as a further source of strength by analysts. Classically, bank earnings and balance sheets look healthy during the good times because the assets are highly valued and the deposits that back them are there. It's when there's a run on deposits and the assets fall in value that banks have problems.

While the Federal Reserve governors debated the need to restrain the rapid lending that was fueling stock speculation, they were hesitant to raise short-term interest rates because the economy wasn't overheating, inflation remained subdued, and higher interest rates would hurt all borrowers, not just speculators.[22] Typically the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth. That is because central banks make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth—not on debt growth, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will produce the incomes required to service them.

New York Times

Rather than raising its discount rate, the Fed enacted macroprudential (i.e., regulatory) measures aimed at constraining the supply of credit via banks. Some of these regulatory measures included lowering the acceptance rate for loans and increasing supervision of credit facilities.[23] The Fed publicly released a letter it had written to regional banks, deriding the "excessive amount of the country's credit absorbed in speculative security loans" and threatening that banks attempting to borrow money from the Fed in order to fund such loans might be refused.[24] But these policies were largely ineffective.

# Late 1929: The Top and the Crash Tightening Pops the Bubble

In 1928, the Fed started to tighten monetary policy. From February to July, rates had risen by 1.5 percent to five percent. The Fed was hoping to slow the growth of speculative credit, without crippling the economy. A year later, in August 1929, it raised rates again, to six percent. As short-term interest rates rose, the yield curve flattened and inverted, liquidity declined, and the return on holding short duration assets such as cash increased as their yields rose. As loans became more costly and holding cash became more attractive than holding longer duration and/or riskier financial assets (such as bonds, equities, and real estate), money moved out of financial assets, causing them to fall in value. Declining asset prices created a negative wealth effect, which fed on itself in the financial markets and fed back into the economy through declining spending and incomes. The bubble reversed into a bust.

News that the Federal Reserve Board in Washington was meeting daily, but not releasing details of the meetings, sparked rumors on Wall Street that a clampdown on speculative debt was coming.[25] After two weeks of modest declines and reports of an unusual Saturday meeting of the Reserve Board, the stock market broke sharply lower on March 25 and then again on March 26. The Dow fell over four percent and the rate on call loans reached 20 percent as panic gripped the market. Trading volumes reached record levels.[26] A wave of margin calls on small leveraged investors resulted in forced selling that exacerbated the decline. After the Federal Reserve Board chose not to act, National City Bank president Charles Mitchell (who was also a director of the New York Fed) announced that his bank stood ready to lend 25 million to the market.[27] This calmed the market, rates fell, and stocks rebounded. Stocks resumed their gains, but this foreshadowed the vulnerability of stocks to tightening in the credit market.

While growth had moderated somewhat, the economy remained strong through the middle of 1929. The June Federal Reserve Bulletin showed that industrial production and factory employment remained at all-time highs through April, and that measures of construction had rebounded sharply after falling through the first quarter.[28]

After another short-lived sell-off in May, the rally accelerated and the bubble reached the blow-off phase. Stocks rose about 11 percent in June, five percent in July, and ten percent in August. This rally was supported by accelerating leverage, as household margin debt rose by more than 1.2 billion over the same three months.

Money continued to tighten. On August 8, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised its discount rate to 6 percent,[29] as it became clear that macroprudential measures had failed to slow speculative lending. At the same time, concerns about the high stock prices and interest rates caused brokers to tighten their terms in the call loan market and raise margin requirements. After dropping them as low as 10 percent the previous year, margin requirements at most brokers rose to 45 to 50 percent.[30]

The stock market peaked on September 3 when the Dow closed at 381—a level that it wouldn't reach again for over 25 years.

It's important to remember that no specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst. As is classic with bubbles, rising prices required buying on leverage to keep accelerating at an unsustainable rate, both because speculators and lenders were near or at their max positions and because tightening changes the economics of leveraging up.

Stocks started to decline in September and early October as a series of bad news stories eroded investor confidence. On September 5, statistician Roger Babson delivered a speech to the National Business Conference that warned about a collapse in prices due to "tight money." A 2.6 percent sell-off followed that became known as the "Babson break." On September 20, the collapse of Clarence Hatrey's London financial empire on fraud charges jolted markets and forced some British investors to raise funds by selling their American holdings.[31] On September 26, the Bank of England raised its discount rate from 5.5 percent to an eight-year high of 6.5 percent and a few European nations followed suit.[32]

Together, by mid-October, these events contributed to a 10 percent sell-off in the markets from their highs. The view among investors and columnists in the major papers was largely that the worst was over and the recent volatility had been good for the market. On October 15, economist Irving Fisher proclaimed that "Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau."[33]

Stock Prices Break on Dark Prophecy

"Out of a clear sky a storm of selling broke on the stock exchange yesterday afternoon and in one hour wiped out millions of dollars in the open market value of securities of all sorts. It was one of the most hectic hours in the history of the Exchange, and wiped out thousands of small speculators who up to noon had been riding along comfortably on their paper profits. In the turbulent last hour of trading, the final quotation of which was not tapped out on Exchange tickers until almost 4 o'clock, about 2,000,000 shares of stock were handled and they hit the exchange in a torrent of liquidation."

Year's Worst Break Hits Stock Market

"Starting as a mild reaction, that grew in intensity with each succeeding hour, a drastic break in stock prices shook the New York Stock Exchange yesterday afternoon. Liquidation that swept through the market in the final hours cut millions of dollars from the open market value of securities. It was the widest decline of the year, accomplished in little more than two hours time. The break had been foreshadowed by the continued tightening of the financial structure as brokers' loans increased, week by week, and by the nervousness and apparent hesitation which has characterized market fluctuations during the last fortnight."

# The Stock Market Crashes

Then the bottom of the market fell out. Since so much happened each day during this period, and to give you a granular understanding, I will transition into a nearly day-by-day account, conveying it via both my own description and in the newsfeed.

Stocks fell sharply on Saturday, October 19, which saw the second-highest trading volume ever in a Saturday session and the decline became self-reinforcing on the downside. A wave of margin calls went out after the close, which required those who owned stocks on leverage to either put up more cash (which was hard to come by) or sell stocks, so they had to sell stocks.[34] Sunday's New York Times headline read, "Stocks driven down as wave of selling engulfs the market."[35] Still, traders widely expected that the market would recover when it opened again on Monday. Over the weekend, Thomas Lamont of J.P. Morgan, looking at the economy, wrote to President Herbert Hoover that the "future appears brilliant."[36]

The week of October 21 began with heavier selling. One analyst described Monday's waves of sell orders as "overwhelming and aggressive."[37] Trading volume again broke records. Another wave of margin calls went out and distressed selling among levered players was prevalent.[38] But markets rallied into the end of Monday's session, so losses were smaller on Monday than they'd been on Saturday.

Tuesday's session saw small gains and Wednesday's opened quietly. But any hopes that the worst had passed were shattered before the market closed on Wednesday. An avalanche of sell orders in the last hour of trading pushed stocks down sharply, which triggered a fresh round of margin calls and more forced selling.[39] The Dow suffered what was then its largest one-day point loss in history, falling 20.7 points (6.3 percent) to close at 305.3.

Because the sell-off was so sharp and came so late in the day, an unprecedented number of margin calls went out that night, requiring investors to post significantly more collateral to avoid having their positions closed out when the market opened on Thursday.[40] Many equity holders would be required to sell.

Everyone who worked on the exchange was alerted to be prepared for the big margin calls and sell orders that would come Thursday morning. Policemen were posted throughout the financial district in the event of trouble. New York Stock Exchange Superintendent William R. Crawford later described

"electricity in the air so thick you could cut it" before the open.[41] Then the collapse and panic came.

After a quieter opening, the avalanche of selling materialized and panic took hold of the market.[42] Sell orders poured in from across the country, pushing down prices and generating new margin calls, which in turn pushed down prices even more. The pace of selling was so frantic that operators struggled to keep up. One exchange telephone clerk captured the scene well: "I can't get any information. The whole place is falling apart."[43] Rumors of failures swirled and as news spread, huge crowds formed in the financial district.[44] By noon of what would become known as Black Thursday, the major indices were down more than 10 percent.

Around midday, a small group of the biggest bankers met at the offices of J.P. Morgan and hatched a plan to stabilize the market. "The Bankers' Pool," as they were known, committed to buy 125 million in shares. Early in the afternoon, traders acting on behalf of the bankers began to place large buy orders above the most recent price.[45] As news of the plan spread, other investors began to buy aggressively in response and prices rose. After hitting a low of 272 (down 33), the Dow Jones Industrial Index bounced back to close at 299, down only six points for the day.[46] But as it turned out, this would just be the first of many failed attempts to bolster the market.

Confidence in the soundness of the stock market structure, notwithstanding the upheaval of the last few days, was voiced last night by bankers and other financial leaders. Sentiment as expressed by the heads of some of the largest banking institutions and by industrial executives as well was distinctly cheerful and the feeling was general that the worst had been seen. Wall Street ended the day in an optimistic frame of mind.

The opinion of brokers was unanimous that the selling had got out of hand not because of any inherent weakness in the market but because the public had become alarmed over the steady liquidation of the last few weeks. Over their private wires these brokers counseled their customers against further thoughtless selling at sacrifice prices.

Charles E. Mitchell, chairman of the National City Bank, declared that fundamentals remained unimpaired after the declines of the last few days. "I am still of the opinion," he added, "that this reaction has badly overrun itself."

After the market closed on Thursday, a group of about 35 brokers began organizing a second effort to stabilize the market. Believing that the worst had passed, they took out a full-page ad in the New York Times for Friday, confidently telling the public that it was time to buy.[47] That same day, President Hoover declared, "The fundamental business of the country, that is, production and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous basis."[48] Stocks were steady through the rest of the week, and the Sunday papers again showed optimism that the cheapness of stocks would support a rebound in the coming week.[49]

But the collapse and panic resumed on Monday the 28th as a flood of sell orders came in from all types of investors. Notably, significant selling came

Another massive wave of margin calls went out Monday night and  \$150 million of call loans had been pulled from the market before Tuesday's open.[53] The Federal Reserve attempted to counter the collapse in credit by providing liquidity. After a 3 a.m. meeting with his directors, New York Fed president George Harrison announced before the market opened that the Fed would inject\$ 100 million in liquidity to ease the credit crunch in the money market by purchasing government securities. Harrison needed approval from the Fed Board in Washington, but he didn't want to wait; instead he made the purchases outside the regular Open Market Investment Committee account.[54] Classically the checks and balances designed to ensure stability during normal times are poorly suited for crisis scenarios where immediate, aggressive action is required. In the late 1920s, there were few well-established paths for dealing with the debt implosion and its domino effects.

While the Fed's liquidity eased credit conditions and likely prevented a number of failures, it wasn't enough to stop the stock market's collapse on what became known as Black Tuesday. Starting at the open, large blocks of shares flooded the market and pushed prices down.[55] A rumor that the Bankers' Pool had shifted to selling fed the panic.[56] The members of the New York Stock Exchange met at noon to discuss closing the exchange, before deciding against it.[57] The investment trusts were hit especially hard as the leverage that buoyed returns through the bubble started to work in reverse. Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation fell 42 percent and Blue Ridge was at one point down as much as 70 percent before recovering somewhat.[58] The Dow closed down 11.7 percent, the second worst one-day loss in history. The market had fallen by 23 percent over two days and problems with leveraged speculators and their lenders were already starting to emerge.

# 240 Issues Lose 15,894,618,894 in Month; Slump in Full Exchange List Vastly Larger

The drastic effects of Wall Street's October bear market is shown by valuation tables prepared last night by The New York TIMES, which place the decline in the market value of 240 representative issues on the New York Stock Exchange at  $15,894,818,894$  during the period from Oct. 1 to yesterday's closing. Since there are 1,379 issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the total depreciation for the month is estimated at between two and three times the loss for the 240 issues covered by The Times table.

Among the losses of the various groups comprising the 240 stocks in THE TIMES valuation table were the following:

Number of Decline Stocks. in Value. 25 1,128,686,488 29 5,135,724,373 25 1,689,840,902 22 1,382,617,778 25 524,403,620 9 1,621,697,977

Stocks snapped back on Wednesday, rising 12.3 percent in one of the sharp bear market rallies that classically occur repeatedly during the depression phases of big debt crises. Following the rally, the NYSE announced that trading would begin at noon the next day and that the exchange would be closed on the following Friday and Saturday in order to catch up on paperwork.[59]

Both the Fed and the Bank of England cut rates on Thursday. The Fed dropped its bank rate from 6 percent to 5 percent in coordination with the Bank of England's move to decrease its discount rate from 6.5 percent to 6 percent.[60] Traders also cheered the news that call loans outstanding had fallen by more than 1 billion from the prior week. Believing that the worst of the forced selling had passed, markets rallied again.

But speculators looking to capitalize on the prior week's rally raced to sell when the market opened on Monday and stocks plunged again. By Wednesday, the Dow was down 15 percent on the week. Stocks continued to fall the following week as well.

Bonds Irregular on Stock Exchange; Domestic Issues Easier, but Foreign Loans Display Stronger Tone

"Bond prices showed considerable irregularity yesterday on the Stock Exchange, with domestic issues a trifle easier, on the average, and with foreign loans pointed upward. Liberty bonds and treasury issues were a shade lower in dull trading."

-New York Times corporate bonds (rated BAA and below) reached their widest level in 1929, so the riskier corporate bonds were flat to down. That sort of market action—equities and bonds with credit risk falling and Treasury and other low credit risk assets rising—is typical in this phase of the cycle.

Naturally the financial and psychological impacts of the stock market plunge began to hurt the economy. As is typical, politicians and business leaders continued to talk up the strength of the economy, but stats showed weakness. Industrial production had peaked in July. More timely measures of freight car loading and steel utilization released the week of November 4 showed ongoing declines in economic activity. Sharp drops in commodity markets added to these worries. By mid-November, the Dow was down almost 50 percent from its September peak.

# Policy Responses to the Crash

Although the Hoover Administration's handling of the market crash and economic downturn is now often criticized, its early moves were broadly praised and helped drive a meaningful stock rally. On November 13, President Hoover proposed a temporary one percent reduction in the tax rate for each income bracket and an increase to public construction spending of 175 million.[61] Two days later, Hoover announced his plan to invite a "small preliminary conference of representatives of industry, agriculture and labor" to develop a plan for fighting the downturn.[62] When they convened the following week, Hoover solicited pledges from business leaders to not cut spending on capital investment or wages, and from labor union leaders to not strike or demand higher wages.[63] On December 5, Hoover convened a conference of 400 of the most reputable businessmen at the time, which in turn created a leadership committee of 72 of the top business tycoons of the 1920s headed by the Chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce.[64] This mix of policies was successful for a time, as was Hoover's support for the Federal Reserve System's efforts to ease credit.

As mentioned, the New York Fed aggressively provided liquidity during the crash. Within a month, it cut its discount rate from 6 percent to 5 percent and then cut it again, to  $4 \frac{1}{2}$  percent.

These policy moves combined with other steps by the private sector to support the stock market, most notably John D. Rockefeller's bid for one million shares of Standard Oil Co. at  \$50 on November 13 (effectively flooring the price at\$ 50).65 On November 13, the market bottomed and began what was to be a 20 percent rally going into December. A sense of optimism took hold.

# 1930-1932: Depression

By New Year's Day of 1930 it was widely believed that the stock market's 50 percent correction was over, which helped drive a strong rebound in the first four months of the year.[66] Stocks seemed cheap because there wasn't much evidence yet that company earnings would fall much, and investors were biased by their memories of the most recent downturns (e.g., in 1907 and 1920). In both cases, the worst was over after a correction of about 50 percent, and most assumed that events would play out similarly this time.

Helping to fuel the optimism, policy makers continued to take steps to stimulate the economy. The Fed cut rates to 3.5 percent in March, bringing the total rate cuts to 2.5 percent in just five months (sparking debate within the Fed over whether it was too much stimulation and risked weakening the dollar).[67] On March 25, Congress passed two appropriation bills for state road building and construction projects, bringing the total fiscal stimulus to about 1 percent of GDP.[68]

The consensus among economists, including those at the American Economic Association and the Federal Reserve, was that the simulative policy moves would be enough to support an economic rebound. On January 1, the New York Times captured how sentiment had shifted since the crash, noting, "Lack of widespread commercial failures, the absence of serious unemployment, and robust recovery in the stock market have been factors calculated to dispel the gloominess."[69] As a further sign of optimism, banks were actually expanding their investments through 1930; member banks' holdings of foreign, municipal, government, and railroad bonds all rose.[70]

By April 10, the Dow had rallied back above 290. But despite stimulation and general optimism, economic weakness persisted. First quarter earnings were disappointing, and stocks began to slide starting in late April. In the early stages of deleveragings, it's very common for investors and policy makers to underestimate how much the real economy will weaken, leading to small rallies that quickly reverse, and initial policy responses that aren't enough.

Over the second half of 1930, the economy clearly began to weaken. From May through December, department store sales fell 8 percent and industrial production fell 17.6 percent. Over the course of the year, the rate of unemployment rose by over 10 percent (to 14 percent) and capacity utilization fell by 12 percent (to 67 percent). Housing and mortgage debt collapsed. Still, at that point, the decline in the economy was more akin to a shallow recession. For example, levels of consumer spending remained above the lows of previous

As the economy weakened, the sell-off across markets resumed. Stocks ended the period on a low note: By October of 1930, the stock market had fallen below the lows reached in November 1929. Commodities also fell sharply. Market analysts and investors alike were realizing that their hopes for a quick recovery would not materialize.[71] But Hoover remained optimistic.

Although the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates and the Treasury bond market was strong, spreads continued to widen. This increased the interest rates facing most consumers and businesses. For example, rates rose on long-term mortgage loans, and the yields on municipal bonds, which had performed well following the crash, began to rise as credit anxieties developed. Some industries were hit particularly hard by the worsening credit conditions. Railroads had large amounts of debts they needed to roll, and were facing both tighter credit conditions and decreased earnings.[72] Because railroads were considered a vital industry, the government wanted to support them, likely with a bailout. (The railroad industry's circumstances in this period parallel the struggles the auto industry faced in the 2008 financial crisis.)

# Rising Protectionism

As is common in severe economic downturns, protectionist and anti-immigrant sentiment began to rise. Politicians blamed some of the weakness on anti-competitive policies by other countries, and posited that higher tariffs would help reverse the slump in manufacturing and agriculture, while restricting immigration would help the economy deal with unemployment.[73]

Protectionist sentiment resulted most notably in the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which imposed tariffs on nearly 20,000 US imports. Investors and economists alike feared that the proposed 20 percent increase in tariffs would trigger a global trade war and cripple an already weak global economy.[74] As the act neared passage in early May, a group of 1,028 economists issued an open letter to Hoover imploring him to veto the bill if it passed in Congress.[75] Foreign governments also expressed opposition and hinted at retaliation.[76] However, tariffs—particularly on agricultural imports—were one of Hoover's campaign promises, so he was reluctant to renegate even as the pushback against the Smoot-Hawley tariffs became more intense.[77]

Stocks sold off sharply as it became clear the tariff bill would pass. After falling 5 percent the previous week, the Dow dropped another 7.9 percent on June 16, the day before the tariff bill passed. The following chart shows the average tariff rate charged on US imports going back to the 1800s. While tariffs have sometimes increased during periods of economic downturn, Smoot-Hawley pushed tariffs to near-record levels.[78]

Source: Irwin, "Clashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy"

Soon the US faced a wave of retaliatory protectionist policies. The most impactful initial response came from the US's largest trading partner, Canada, which at the time took in 20 percent of American exports. Canadian policy makers increased tariffs on 16 US goods while simultaneously lowering tariffs on imports from the British Empire.[79] As similar policies piled up in the years that followed, they accelerated the collapse in global trade caused by the economic contraction.

Restricting immigration (both legal and illegal), another common protectionist response to economic weakness, was also pursued by the Hoover administration in 1930. On September 9, Hoover put a ban on immigration, allowing travel only for tourists, students, and working professionals, describing the policy as necessary to deal with unemployment. He later reflected in his memoir his view that, "directly or indirectly all immigrants were a public charge at the moment—either they themselves went on relief as soon as they landed, or if they did get jobs, they forced others onto relief."[80]

# Bank Failures Begin

Banks had largely held up well following the stock market crash, but as those they lent to were hurt by the crash and the economy weakened, they began to feel it. In 1930, bank net earnings declined about 40 percent compared to the prior year, but they remained on sound footing.[81] Several of the largest banks even increased their dividends. They looked strong at the time compared to the markets and the economy, and many analysts believed that they would be a source of support through the downturn.[82] The majority of early failures were confined to banks in the Midwest and country banks that had a lot of money in real estate loans, and were exposed to losses from a drought.[83] While the failures started small, they spread as credit problems spread.

By December, 1930 bank failures had become a meaningful risk to the broader economy. Worries about the banks led to runs on them. Runs on

Before I get into the banking failures, it's important to discuss the gold standard, since it played an important role in determining how the 1930s debt crisis transpired. As I described in prior sections of the book, when debts are denominated in one's own currency, deleveragings can generally be managed well. Being on a gold standard is akin to having debts denominated in a foreign currency because creditors could demand payment in gold (as was often written into contracts), and policy makers couldn't freely print money, as too much printing would lead people to redeem their money for gold. So policy makers were working with a limited toolkit until they broke the link to gold.

The most important bank failure of this period was that of the Bank of the United States, which had some 400,000 depositors, more than any bank in the country at the time.[84] The run on it began on December 10 because of a false rumor. Wall Street financiers—including the heads of J.P. Morgan and Chase—met at the New York Fed to determine whether they should provide the 30 million that was required to save the bank. Many within the group thought that the bank was insolvent, not simply illiquid, so they should let it fail.[85] New York Superintendent of Banks Joseph Broderick argued that its closing "would result in the closing of at least ten other banks in the city and … it might even affect the savings banks" (e.g., it was systemically important). He also noted that he believed the bank to be solvent.[86] Broderick's colleagues ultimately did not agree with him. When the bank closed its doors the next day, it was the biggest single bank failure in history.[87] The New York Times would later refer to its failure as "The First Domino In the Depression."[88] It was certainly a turning point for public confidence in the nation's banking system.

Banks are structurally vulnerable to runs because of the liquidity mismatch between their liabilities (i.e., short-term deposits) and assets (i.e., illiquid loans and securities), so even a sound bank can fail if it can't sell its assets fast enough to meet its liabilities. Because of the gold standard, the Federal Reserve was restricted in how much it could print money, limiting how much it could lend to a bank facing liquidity problems (i.e., act as a "lender of last resort"). There were also legal constraints. For instance, the Fed at the time was only allowed to give direct access to its credit to member banks, but only 35 percent of commercial banks were members.[89] So banks would often have to borrow from the private sector and sell their assets in a "fire sale" to avoid failure.

The end of 1930 also saw the political winds beginning to shift. With the downturn playing prominently in voters' minds, the Democrats swept Congress in the November mid-term elections. This foreshadowed FDR's win in the presidential election two years later.[90]

# First Quarter, 1931: Optimism Gives Way to Gloom as Economy Continues to Deteriorate

At the start of 1931, economists, politicians, and other experts in both the US and Europe still retained hope that there would be an imminent return to normalcy because the problems still seemed manageable. The bank failures of the previous quarter were thought to be inconsequential, and not damaging to the overall financial system.

By March, all business indexes were pointing to a rise in employment, wages, and industrial production. Bank runs led to a less than 10 percent drop in deposits.[91] The news reflected growing economic confidence: on March 23, the New York Times declared that the depression had bottomed, and the U.S. economy was on its way back up.[92] New investment trusts were being formed to profit from the expected "long recovery."[93]

Optimism was also bolstered by the recovery of the stock market. Through the end of February, the Dow rose more than 20 percent off its December lows. The following chart illustrates the index's rise.

Almost all branches of industry shared in the decline. Employment declined, and total income of both wage earners and farmers decreased. At the same time wholesale prices throughout the world declined considerably, and retail prices also reflected this decline, although in smaller degree."

# The Growing Debate over Economic Policy

In a depression, the main ways that politics might play a role are by standing in the way of the implementation of sensible economic policies or by leading to extreme policies. These are important risks that can make a depression worse.

After more than a year of economic contraction, the political debate over economic policy was intensifying. By this time, more than six million people were unemployed in the United States and there was no agreement among policy makers and business leaders on how to deal with it.[94] Understanding this debate is key to understanding why policy makers took certain steps that ultimately worsened the crisis. It also helps illustrate many of the classic mistakes policy makers make when handling big debt crises.

The fiscal policy debate centered on whether or not the Federal government should significantly ramp up spending to support the economy. Senate Democrats, joined by some Republicans, pushed the President to increase "direct relief" for those facing particularly difficult circumstances. That would of course mean larger deficits and more debt, and it would mean changing the rules of the game to shift wealth from one set of players to others, rather than letting the game play out in a way that would provide good lessons to help prevent such problems in the future (i.e., the moral hazard perspective). There was also a strong belief that, if this money was just given away and not turned into productivity, it would be wasted. So while the Hoover administration had supported earlier fiscal stimulus, it opposed significant direct relief from the Federal government that would "bring an inevitable train of corruption and waste such as our nation had never witnessed." Hoover's administration instead advocated for what he called "indirect relief"—a mix of policies that included lobbying the private sector to invest and keep employment steady, reliance on aid from state and local governments, immigration restrictions, and macroprudential policies to encourage lending.[95]

While concerns over budget deficits limited stimulus spending, by 1931, the federal government budget deficit grew to 3 percent of GDP. The deficit was due to falling tax revenue, which had collapsed to nearly half of 1929 levels, and an increase in social spending of about 1 billion that had been approved the previous year. Treasury Secretary Mellon believed that balancing the budget was a necessary first step to restore business confidence.[96] Hoover agreed for reasons he later summarized in his memoir: "National stability required that we balance the budget."[97]

Worries over the deficit and a push for austerity are classic responses to the depression phase of a big debt crisis. Austerity seems like the obvious response, but the problem is that one person's spending is another person's income, so when spending is cut, incomes are also cut, with the result that it takes an awful lot of painful spending cuts to make significant reductions in debt/income ratios.

For all the suffering that the Depression had caused, a sense of crisis-driven urgency hadn't yet developed. The economy was still contracting over the first half of 1931, but at a slower rate than the year before. Hoover was certain that indirect relief was meeting the needs of the people and he did not see the need to use additional fiscal supports.[98] As we'll discuss later, this ultimately tipped the debate, and the Hoover administration to make the classic rookie mistake of leaning too heavily on austerity and other deflationary levers relative to more stimulative policies until the pain of doing these things became intolerable.

# Second Quarter, 1931: The Global Dollar Shortage Causes a Global Debt Crisis and a Strong Dollar

Because dollar-denominated credit was collapsing and a lot of dollar-denominated debt that required dollar credit to service it existed around the world, a global dollar shortage emerged during the first half of 1931. Classically, there is a squeeze in a reserve currency that is widely lent by foreign financial institutions when there is a collapse of credit creation in that currency.

Although other currencies faced a shortage amid the credit crunch, the dollar was particularly impacted because of its role as a global funding currency. At the same time, falling US imports reduced foreigners' dollar income, intensifying the squeeze. Note that virtually the same dollar squeeze dynamics occurred in the 2008 crisis for the same reasons.

As the financial markets and many other markets are global, one can't understand all that happened by looking only at the US. What happened in the US had a big impact on what happened in Germany, which led to big political changes that were felt around the world in the 1930s and early 1940s. In 1931

Hoover Urges Arms Cut to Revive Trade in Opening World Chamber of Commerce: Foreign Delegates Attack High Tariffs; 35 Nations Represented; President Asks That Land Forces Be Reduced as Navies Are

-New York Times

Germany was the epicenter of the emerging dollar squeeze. It had previously faced great difficulty paying back the reparation debt it owed and had been forced to borrow as a result. The country had become a popular destination for the "carry trade," in which investors would lend their dollars to Germany to earn a higher yield than they would get in dollars and Germans would borrow in dollars to get the lower interest rate. Once again, this type of behavior is classic in the "good times," when there is little perceived risk and large cross-country credit creation, and sets up the conditions that make the "bad times" worse when the reversal happens. At the time, Germany was highly dependent on this flow of money that could easily be pulled, and by 1931, American banks and companies held about a billion dollars in short-term German bills (equal to about six percent of German GDP).[99] That made both the German borrowers and the American banks and companies very vulnerable.

Also, as is typical in such times, economies and wealth disparities fuel the rise of populist and extremist leaders globally, with the ideological fight between the authoritarian left and the authoritarian right. Both the German Communist party and Hitler's Nazi party made big electoral gains as the German economy struggled—with the Nazis going from under 3 percent support in the 1928 Reichstag elections to over 18 percent in September 1930. Meanwhile, the largest party (center left Social Democratic Party) slipped to less than a quarter of Reichstag seats.[100] Together, the far right and far left parties easily had enough parliamentary support to force Germany into an unstable multi-party coalition government. Germany was essentially becoming ungovernable.

The global trade war made economic conditions and the dollar squeeze worse. The collapse in global trade depressed foreigners' dollar income, which in turn made it harder for foreigners to service their dollar debts. As shown below, US imports in dollars had fallen by about 50 percent from 1929 to 1931.

In a warning that would be echoed by global politicians and business leaders in the coming months, the president of Chase National Bank acknowledged in the August 1931 issue of Time magazine that companies' inability to obtain enough dollars to cover their debts was heavily affecting business. As such, he stressed the necessity for the US government to reduce debts owed to them from abroad.

The shortage of dollars made borrowing more expensive, creating a liquidity squeeze in central Europe. To alleviate the liquidity squeeze and allow the continued financing of fiscal deficits, these governments naturally turned to some money printing (since the alternative of allowing the credit crunch to spiral was worse). This increased inflation, raising fears of a return to the hyperinflation of the early 1920s in Germany. In essence, Germany was facing a balance of payments crisis. On May 7, the US Ambassador to Germany, Frederic M. Sackett, told President Hoover of Germany's economic strain, listing its pockets of weakness: capital flight, currency difficulties, unemployment, global tightening of credit, pressures for debt payments, and refusals to renew foreign held German bank accounts.[101]

Austria was also facing major losses. On May 8, Credit Anstalt, the oldest and largest of Austria's banks, announced a 20 million loss resulting partially from its role in the rescue of another failing bank in 1929 that had nearly wiped out its equity.[102] A run ensued and this spread to a run on the Austrian currency. When risks emerge that systemically important institutions will fail, policy makers must take steps to keep these entities running to limit the impact of their failure on other solvent institutions or the economy at large. Keeping these institutions intact is also important for keeping credit pipes in place for lending to creditworthy borrowers, particularly for financial systems with a concentrated set of lenders. But since Austria was on the gold standard, policy makers couldn't print money to provide liquidity and other frantic attempts to secure loans to stabilize the bank failed.

Geopolitical strains made the crisis worse. France feared Austria and Germany's increasingly close ties. In an effort to weaken those countries, the French government encouraged the Bank of France and other French banks to withdraw the short-term credit they had provided to Austria.[103]

Viewing the interconnectedness of global financial institutions and the weakness of Europe as potential threats to its domestic recovery, the United States began to study methods of relieving the pressure on the German economy. On May 11, President Hoover asked Treasury Secretary Mellon and Secretary of State Henry Stimson to look into relaxing Germany's significant payments for war debts and reparations. A proposal was not put forth until early the next month.[104]

In the interim, bank runs spread throughout Europe. Hungary reported bank runs starting in May, leading to the imposition of a bank holiday.[105] The German government nationalized Dresdner Bank, the nation's second largest bank, by buying its preferred shares.[106] Major financial institutions failed across Romania, Latvia, and Poland.[107]

Germany was facing capital flight. The country's gold and foreign exchange reserves fell by a third in June, to the lowest level in five years. To stem the outflow of capital, the bank tightened monetary policy, increasing its discount rate to 15 percent and its collateralized loan rate to 20 percent.[108]

Stock Prices (Local FX, Indexed to Jul 1929)

Political turmoil in Europe led funds to flow into the US, which increased demand for US Treasuries and pushed down interest rates. In an attempt to lessen the demand for dollars, the Federal Reserve reduced its discount rate to 1.5 percent.

On June 5, President Hoover suggested to his cabinet that all governments grant a moratorium of a year on all intergovernmental payments. President Paul von Hindenburg of the Weimar Republic made an appeal, stating that Germany was in danger of collapse, which helped push Hoover to swiftly adopt the plan.[109] On June 20, Hoover officially announced his proposal for a moratorium on Germany's debts for one year. Under his proposal, the US would forgo  \$245 million in debt service payments due over the next year from Britain, France, and other European powers. However, in order to receive these concessions, the allies had to suspend\$ 385 million in reparations due from Germany.[110]

In what became known as the "moratorium rally," the Dow rallied 12 percent in the two days following Hoover's announcement and ended the month 23 percent above the low that it had reached on June 2. German stocks rose 25 percent on the first day of trading following the announcement. Commodity prices soared in the following weeks.

On July 6, the moratorium negotiations finally concluded. Fifteen countries agreed to it, though the share of German reparations that were suspended in the final agreement was lower than Hoover's initial proposal. France refused to participate, but did agree to re-lend their reparations back in to Germany.[111] The Dow slumped 4.5 percent on the day.

The chart below puts things in perspective; the arrow under the grey shaded area shows the moratorium rally. Notice how insignificant that 35 percent rally looks within the bigger moves. I can assure you that those sorts of moves don't seem small when you're going through them. Throughout the Great Depression, announcements of big policy moves like this one repeatedly produced waves of optimism and big rallies, amid a decline that totaled almost 90 percent. Investors were repeatedly disappointed when the policy moves weren't enough and the economy continued to deteriorate. As noted earlier, bear market rallies like this are classic in a depression, since workers, investors, and policy makers have a strong tendency to exaggerate the importance of relatively small things that appear big close-up.

# Third Quarter, 1931: The Debt Moratorium Fails and the Run on Sterling Begins

It quickly became clear that the debt moratorium wasn't going to be enough to save Germany. In early July, rumors circulated that one of Germany's largest banks, Danat Bank, was on the verge of failure.[112] The Reichsbank, Germany's central bank, viewed it as systemically important and wanted to bail it out to avert the complete collapse of the German credit system, but it lacked the foreign reserves needed to do that.[113]

On July 8, just one day after the moratorium had been finalized, Reichsbank president Hans Luther began to reach out to policy makers from Britain to request further negotiations of Germany's current debts and the possibility of a new loan. Luther needed a new 1 billion loan without political concessions. Policy makers from the other countries balked at this—no one wanted to lend even more to Germany.[114] Hoover instead proposed a 'standstill' agreement, which would require all banks holding German and Central European short-term obligations to keep the credit extended, exposing them to big liquidity and potential solvency problems as they needed the cash to meet their obligations.[115]

Naturally, banks were opposed to the standstill agreement and Treasury Secretary Mellon implored Hoover to reconsider. Hoover would not budge. He described his reasoning in his memoir: "This was a banker-made crisis… the bankers must shoulder the burden of the solution, not our taxpayers."[116] Hoover's instinct to have the banks bear the cost is a classic but misguided policy response to a debt crisis. Punishing the banks in a way that weakens them makes sense for a few moral and economic reasons, as mentioned in the discussion of the archetypal template, and it can be a political necessity as the public hates the bankers at such times—but it can have disastrous consequences for the financial system and markets.

Without a forceful policy response in support of the banks, the collapse continued and Germany's depression became much worse, inciting riots across the country.[117] Hitler was gearing up to run for Chancellor; he adopted the strongly populist stance of threatening to not repay the country's reparation debts at all. When the foreign ministers met in London on July 20, plans for a new loan slowly fizzled. Ultimately they put in place a three-month extension of an earlier loan along with a standstill agreement. The result was a classic run on the currency as described in the archetypal template.

# The Run on Sterling

Germany's problems proved to be a key source of contagion. UK banks had lots of loans to Germany, so they couldn't get their money out; when foreign investors saw that the UK's banks were in trouble, they began to pull their money. On July 24, France began withdrawing gold from England. This was interpreted as a lack of confidence in the pound, which prompted more countries to pull their deposits from Britain, and the run on sterling began.[118]

To defend the currency, the Bank of England sold its reserves (a third of them in August alone) and raised interest rates, both classic moves. Foreigners were watching the weekly declines in gold reserves, so the pressure on the pound only increased.

The Bank of England also sought loans from abroad to support the currency, but these loans effectively funded the flight out of sterling. On August 1, 1931, the Bank requested that the US government organize a loan from private US banks totaling  \$250 million, which Hoover urged to be done right away.[119] The flight from sterling continued and the Bank of England received another loan, this time of\$ 200 million from American banks and 200 million from French banks, which was made on August 28.[120] Hoover approved of them, but acknowledged after the fact that, "Both loans, however, mostly served to create more fear."[121]

On Saturday, September 19, having exhausted all of its foreign loans and with just over £100 million in gold reserves remaining, the Bank of England stopped supporting the pound and let it fall sharply, and of course the following day, officially suspended gold payments, a de facto default.[122] Initially, the public did not understand what going off the gold standard would mean for their transactions. Newspapers lamented it as the end of an era.[123]

Sterling fell 30 percent over the next three months. On the first trading day since gold payments had been halted, sterling dropped to  \$3.70, nearly 25 percent lower than its pre-default level of\$ 4.86. British policy makers didn't intervene in the market to slow the fall or maintain stability. Sterling exchange rates fluctuated greatly before dropping to a low of 3.23 in December. Over the same period, the UK's equity market recovered and rose 11 percent in local currency terms.

Other countries followed the UK in abandoning gold convertibility so they could finally "print money" and devalue their currencies. Most of these devaluations were roughly 30 percent (e.g., the Nordic countries, Portugal, much of eastern Europe, New Zealand, Australia, India), in line with sterling's devaluation. The chart, below right, shows the depreciations for a few countries.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/6d5bcee150215e6addee5ba33872196782393ab895a9b8c8cbb72b2cccd228a8.jpg)

Investors feared that government bonds would be defaulted on with devalued money. This led to a run out of bonds, which raised interest rates and drove bond prices down. In the United States, the Fed raised interest rates by 2 percent in order to attract foreign capital and hold the gold peg. Each government's bonds hit new lows in 1931. All except Switzerland's and France's declined at least 20 percent from their 1931 highs. Global stocks also sold off and some markets stopped trading altogether. On September 21, only the Paris Stock Exchange was open in Europe.[124]

-Federal Reserve Bulletin

UK stocks and bonds sold off during the currency defense phase and continued to weaken immediately following the devaluation, but then rebounded. Because the UK's debt was denominated in its own currency, there wasn't a risk that the government couldn't pay it back. Consistent with these pressures on the bond market, the UK's 5.5 percent bonds due in 1937 had dropped to  \$92 after the devaluation from\$ 104 (as interest rates rose from 4.7 percent to 5.7 percent in December), but they moved back up to 100 by the end of the year.[125]

The devaluation helped stimulate the export sector of the economy and allowed the Bank of England to ease significantly, cutting rates by one percent by the end of the year. Equilibrium was reached so that, by the end of October, banks in London were receiving money again. In other words, the devaluation and money printing kicked off a beautiful deleveraging (I'll go through this more later, when I discuss the US leaving the gold standard). Consistent with these pressures, UK stocks and bonds both rallied after selling off sharply through the currency defense phase and immediately following the devaluation. It is important to understand that these moves are very classic. Why they work as they do is explained in the archetypal template.

# Fourth Quarter, 1931: The International Crisis Spreads to the US and the Depression Worsens

As other currencies devalued and the dollar rose, it created more deflationary/ depressing pressures in the US. Sterling's devaluation in September 1931 especially stunned global investors and sent shock waves through US markets.

Naturally investors and savers around the world began to question whether the US was safe from either default or devaluation, so they started to sell out of their dollar debt positions. That raised interest rates and tightened liquidity, bringing on the most painful period of the depression, lasting until FDR took the US off the gold standard eighteen months later to devalue the dollar and print money.

Stocks had sold off during the run on sterling. The Dow finished September down 30.7 percent, its largest monthly loss since the crisis began. On October 5, the market fell 10.7 percent in a single day. Amid the chaos, the NYSE once again banned short selling in a classic attempt to slow the sell-off.[126] While previously "safe" treasury bonds had rallied as stocks crashed in 1929 and 1930, they were now selling off along with stocks, reflecting the US balance of payments crisis. The yield on long-term US treasuries rose to 4 percent, nearly 1 percent above their midyear lows. Due to the US's stock of debts and their rising debt service, there were concerns about the US Treasury's ability to roll bonds that would come due in the following two years. $^{127}$  The fear of devaluation led to particularly acute runs on US banks, so banks needed to sell bonds to raise cash, which contributed to rising yields. $^{128}$

In September 1931, the dollar ceased to be a safe haven for the first time since the global debt crisis began. Gold reserves began to flow out of the US following sterling's devaluation as central banks in France, Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands all began to convert their dollars to gold. The US lost about 10 percent of its gold reserves within the three weeks following the sterling devaluation.

On October 9, in an effort to attract investors, the New York Federal Reserve Bank increased the discount rate from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent. This was no different than tightening, which is not a path to good things in a depression. Classically, in a balance of payments crisis, interest rate increases large enough to adequately compensate holders of debt in weak currency for the currency risk are way too large to be tolerated by the domestic economy, so they don't work. This was no exception, so a week later, the New York Fed again raised its interest rate to 3.5 percent.[129] Rumors flew that the head of the New York Fed, George Harrison, had asked the French not to withdraw any more gold from the United States.[130]

Given the domestic difficulties, investors in the US had taken to hoarding gold and cash. This led to a series of bank runs in late 1931 that caused many banks to close and resulted in a big contraction in deposits for those remaining open. As banks' deposits fell, they began to call their loans in order to build up their cash reserves. Homes and farms were forced into foreclosure, and several companies went bankrupt as investors did not roll loans they had previously extended.[131]

# News & Federal Reserve Bulletin

November 1931

Review of the Month

During the 6-week period following the suspension of gold payments by Great Britain there was a decrease in the country's stock of monetary gold amounting to  \$730,000,000 and an increase in currency outstanding of\$ 390,000,000. Both of these factors increased the demand for reserve bank credit, and the total volume of this credit, notwithstanding a considerable decrease in member bank reserve balances, increased by 930,000,000 during the period, and was at the end of October at the highest level in 10 years. The outflow of gold, which began at the time of the suspension of gold payments by Great Britain on September 21, was the largest movement of the metal during a similar period in any country at any time."

As money and credit contracted, the economy started to fall off a cliff. Over the second half of 1931, industrial production contracted by 14.3 percent and department store sales fell 12.9 percent. By the end of 1931, unemployment had reached nearly 20 percent, and domestic prices were falling 10 percent per year.

The Hoover administration took several steps to stem bank failures and stimulate the flow of credit in late 1931. The most notable among these was the creation of the National Credit Association, which provided a pool of private money that could be lent against sound collateral to provide liquidity to banks at risk of failing (i.e., a private central bank). The funds came from the banks and totaled 500 million, with the ability to borrow another billion.[132]

At the same time, Hoover was looking for solutions for the collapsing real estate market. To stop foreclosures on mortgages of "the homes and farms of responsible people," he sought to create a system of Home Loan Discount Banks, which he did in 1932. In the meantime, he worked with both the insurance and real estate agencies to suspend foreclosures on farm loans by the Federal Land Banks, while providing the institution with 1 billion so that it could expand its lending.[133]

The policies were well received and broadly inspired confidence among investors. The stock market rallied in response, up 35 percent from its October bottom to November 9, with a jump of more than 10 percent on the day the National Credit Association was announced. The rally made some believe the worst was over, as most significant rallies do. Yet there was no significant change in the total money and credit available, so the fundamental imbalance between total debt coming due and the amount of money available to service it wasn't resolved. As was the case with so many policy announcements throughout the depression, the rally faded as it became clear that the proposals would be too small to handle the problem. Stocks reached a new low near the end of December.

# First Half of 1932: Growing Government Intervention Unable to Halt Economic Collapse

The depression deepened in 1932, as the economy continued to plunge with deflation and credit problems worsening. An astounding number of businesses were struggling or failing—in aggregate, businesses experienced  \$2.7 billion in losses and bankruptcies hit record levels, with almost 32,000 failures and\$ 928 million in liabilities.[134] News of bank failures filled the newspapers. As those losses rippled through the system, imposing losses on lenders and causing other businesses to close shop, the economy contracted still more.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/187eeb5a0736f598706fc12b9689eb97cd6a9f19104815d016ed66793fbd333b.jpg)

US Bank Suspensions by Year

It is classic in a big debt crisis: Policy makers play around with deflationary levers to bring down debt for a couple of years but eventually wake up to the fact that the depressing effects of debt reduction and austerity are both too painful and inadequate to produce the effects that are needed. So more aggressive policies are undertaken. As it became clear that the Hoover administration hadn't done enough to reverse the credit contraction, it announced another set of policies during the first part of 1932 in an attempt to provide liquidity to the banking system and get credit going again.

On January 23, Hoover launched the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The RFC was funded with  \$500 million in capital and had the ability to borrow from the Treasury or private sources up to\$ 3 billion; its goal was to provide liquidity to solvent banks to shore them up against failure.[135] The RFC benefited from a more extensive mandate than the Federal Reserve—it was able to lend against a wider range of collateral and to a broader range of entities. It could also lend to state-chartered banks, banks in rural areas that were not a part of the Federal Reserve System (i.e., some of the banks most affected by the crisis), and railroads, which were an important industry at the time (like the auto industry in 2008).[136] Lending against a widening range of collateral and to an increasingly wide range of borrowers is a classic lever that policy makers pull to ensure that sufficient liquidity gets to the financial system, sometimes provided by central banks and sometimes by central governments.

"An investigation of the New York Stock

-New York Times

By the end of August 1932, the RFC had lent 1.3 billion to 5,520 financial institutions, helping to reduce the number of bank failures.[137] But the RFC was only able to lend against "good" collateral. And so it was unable to provide sufficient support to some of the institutions that needed it the most.[138]

Around this time, the Fed started to experiment with money printing. Going into the crisis, the Federal Reserve was only able to lend against gold or certain forms of commercial paper. With both in short supply, policy makers were once again faced with the trade-off between further tightening and undermining the dollar's peg to gold. The 1932 Banking Act, signed by Hoover on February 27, attempted to alleviate the liquidity squeeze while maintaining the gold standard by increasing the Federal Reserve's ability to print money, but only to buy government bonds (which 75 years later would be called "quantitative easing"). This move was contentious, since it was clearly a weakening of the principles behind the gold standard, but the sense of urgency was such that the bill passed without debate. As Hoover framed it, the decision was "in a sense a national defense measure." Later that year, Congress gave the Federal Reserve additional powers to print money and provide liquidity in an emergency. This provision—Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act—would end up being critical to the Fed's response to the 2008 debt crisis.

The Federal Reserve System bought nearly  \$50 million in government securities each week in April and nearly\$ 100 million each week in May. By June, the system had purchased over 1.5 billion in government securities. The following chart illustrates the Federal Reserve's purchases and holdings of government debt in 1931 and 1932.

Federal Reserve Holdings of US Government Securities (Mln)

Once the Federal Reserve began purchases, yields on short-term Treasury securities fell rapidly with three month T-Bill yields falling more than two percent over the first half of the year. Fed purchases also relieved pressure in the market for longer-term treasury bonds, where the supply-demand imbalance for dollars had reached a breaking point amid large deficits and foreign reluctance to hold US assets. After rising above 4.3 percent in January, yields on ten-year treasuries fell below 3.5 percent over the next six months.

These moves ignited optimism and yet another rally, and the Dow Jones increased by 19.5 percent, reaching January's high. It closed above 80 in February.

Policy makers also took a number of smaller steps to support the banking system during the first half of 1932. Another classic move was the abandonment of mark-to-market accounting for banks. In January, the Comptroller of the Currency instructed bank examiners to use par value as the intrinsic value of bonds held by national banks with a BAA rating or better.[143] Under the prior accounting methodology, banks faced either major paper losses on the bonds they held or cash losses if they sold them. Those losses reduced their capital, forcing them to raise money or sell assets, further constraining liquidity and pushing down asset prices. The change in accounting rules relieved some of the most immediate pressure on banks.

The Hoover administration also tried to get credit going with macroprudential measures, most notably applying direct pressure on banks in an attempt to get them to lend. Hoover and Treasury Secretary Ogden Mills had blamed the banks for their inability to stimulate credit, and accused them of restricting loans and hoarding gold and cash. Hoover organized committees in the twelve Federal Reserve districts which tried to pressure large regional banks into lending, but this effort met with little success.[144]

Though some were helpful, none of these moves were enough to halt the economic collapse. Pressure on US gold reserves continued because foreigners worried that with the monetary expansion and the expanding deficit, the US would not be able to sustain the dollar's conversion to gold at existing rates.[145] As they rushed to make the conversion, gold left the country every month from March to June. In June net gold exports hit 206 million, a level last experienced following the depreciation of sterling.[146] That produced a tightening of credit.

In March, stocks sold off and the market suffered a decline that extended through 11 weeks. The Dow Jones dropped 50 percent, from 88 on March 8 to 44 on May 31. The Dow Jones closed in May on a low for the month, and volume further declined that month to about 750,000 shares per day.[147] Early in the crisis, government efforts to increase lending and spending had led to sustained rallies in asset markets. At this stage, however, investors had become disillusioned. They worried that Hoover's programs were not making enough of a difference to make up for their vast cost, and markets continued to trend downward.

Social unrest and conflict continued to rise globally. In Germany, Hitler won the most seats in the Reichstag election. Japan slipped toward militarism, invading Manchuria in 1931 and Shanghai in 1932. In the US, strikes and protests were also increasing.[148] Unemployment was approaching 25 percent, and those still employed faced wage cuts. Outside of cities, farmers faced ruin as prices fell and a drought destroyed their crops. In one dramatic expression of discontent, thousands of veterans and their families had marched on Washington in June (and stayed there) in an attempt to pressure the government to immediately pay them their veterans' bonuses.[149] On July 28, US Army troops led by General Douglas MacArthur cleared the camp with tanks and tear gas. It was at this time that conflicts both within countries and between countries intensified, sowing the seeds of populism, authoritarianism, nationalism, and militarism that at first led to economic warfare and then military warfare in Europe in September 1939 and with Japan in December 1941.

# Second Half of 1932: Further Contractions and the Election of FDR

By the summer, the big stimulation and relief to banks appeared to be helping. The downward spiral began to moderate, asset prices stabilized, and production actually increased in certain areas of the economy, like autos. From May through June, commodities, stocks, and bonds all bottomed. Markets for both stocks and bonds improved during the second half of the year. In August and September, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied to a peak of 80, almost double its July low. You can see trajectory of the Dow in the chart below.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/fc4d678b2f0a8a9986a7df7829c5fd0de5779a956792506d3066a99dd76778f2.jpg)

Time magazine's August 8, 1932, edition claimed that the rally occurred because the gold outflow had finally ceased, rumors had spread about the country receiving foreign capital, and a railroad merger had been approved.

As optimism about the economy and asset markets began to increase, policy makers began to pull back on their earlier stimulative measures. Also, the RFC was weakened significantly by a scandal when it bailed out Central Republic Bank and Trust, which was headed by the previous chair of the RFC. The public was outraged—the RFC now seemed like a tool of fat-cat bankers.[150] In response, Congress ordered the RFC to publish the names of all the institutions to which they had lent.[151] This effectively meant that getting a loan from the RFC also required advertising that you were in trouble, which of course worsened pressure from depositor withdrawals. Borrowing from the RFC slowed, and withdrawals began to pick up pace.[152]

Outrage over the government's role in "bailing out" financial institutions is one outgrowth of the "Main Street versus Wall Street," or "workers versus investors" conflicts that classically occur during depressions. As economic pain increases, populist calls to "punish the bankers that caused this mess" make it incredibly difficult for policy makers to take the actions that are needed to save the financial system and the economy. After all, if the bankers quit in this chaos, the system would certainly shut down.

Politics also played a part in ending the Fed's purchases of government bonds. The Banking Act passed in February had been framed as a temporary measure due to concerns that it might weaken the dollar. Members of the Federal Reserve from Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston pushed for ending open market operations, arguing that since banks were accumulating increasing reserves but not significantly expanding credit, the program was not necessary (and the lower long-term interest rates from the program were hurting bank profitability). In July they stopped participating, and the New York Fed, unable to continue on its own, was forced to acquiesce.[153]

The administration was worried about the budget deficit ballooning, as receipts fell and expenditures rose.[154] With almost universal support, Hoover pushed to balance the budget through a mix of tax increases and cuts to federal expenditures.[155] On June 6, the Revenue Act of 1932 was signed into law. The act increased income taxes, corporation taxes, and various excise taxes. But despite these efforts, the budget deficit grew significantly relative to GDP because the austerity was contractionary and the economy shrank faster than the budget deficit did.[156] As mentioned earlier, Hoover's attempt to balance the budget through austerity was a rookie move that is classic in depressions.

As is also classic in deleveraging scenarios, the debate about what to do became antagonistically political, with strong populist overtones. Roosevelt came on the scene with what, at the time, seemed like leftist populist policies. From the outset his presidential campaign struck a strongly anti-speculator tone. It opened with a speech that railed against securities firms' abuses and called for federal control of the stock and commodities exchanges.[157] There were indications that he favored a devaluation of the dollar, which increased the pressure on the currency. To allay those fears, Roosevelt said he would not take the country off the gold standard, but investors were not convinced.[158] By the way, politicians and policy makers frequently make disingenuous promises that are expedient and inconsistent with economic and market fundamentals, and such promises should never be believed.

Bank failures were ticking upward, open market operations had ended, the RFC had been neutered, government spending had been reined in, and the threat of devaluation loomed large. Gold outflows resumed and prices, which had recently begun to stabilize, started to fall. The economy's downward trajectory steepened.

The renewed pressure on the banking sector moved into higher gear in November. Right before the election, Nevada declared the first statewide bank holiday, a classic response to widespread bank runs. Although Nevada was able

Nevada Ends Bank Holiday

-New York Times to avert the failure of its main state bank, the holiday sparked a national panic.[159] Fearing that their bank might be next, depositors accelerated their withdrawals. Crisis dynamics were beginning to return.

The collapse of the economy throughout 1932 was breathtaking. The charts below show some of the economic stats, highlighting the period from sterling's devaluation until the end of 1932. Consumer spending and production fell by more than 20 percent and unemployment rose by more than 16 percent. Severe deflation had taken hold and prices were falling by almost one percent every month.

Policy makers' reliance on the deflationary levers of debt reduction had pushed the US into a severe depression/"ugly deleveraging." Since nominal interest rates were well above nominal growth rates, debt grew faster than income and debt burdens rose despite defaults.

But while investors were worried about the effects of a Roosevelt presidency, the populist nature of his campaign (along with the terrible economic conditions) propelled him to victory. Roosevelt was elected in November 1932, winning 22.8 million votes against Hoover's 15.8 million, the most popular votes ever won by a presidential candidate up to that time.

Driven by weak economic conditions, an uneven recovery (in which the elite was perceived to be prospering while the common man was still struggling), and ineffectual policy makers, populism was a global phenomenon in the interwar period (the 1920s to the 1930s), leading to regime changes not only in the United States, but also in Germany, Italy, and Spain. In the United States, inequality (in both income and wealth shares) peaked in the early 1930s, but remained high for the rest of the decade. By the time of Roosevelt's election, the top 10 percent earned 45 percent of the income and owned 85 percent of the wealth while unemployment was over 20 percent. These conditions caused FDR to base his campaign on a "New Deal," which promised big changes for workers, debtors, and the unemployed.[160]

Europe had a similar set of economic conditions. Germany had experienced both a hyperinflation and the start of the Great Depression in the prior fifteen years. Inequality was also high—the top 10 percent earned about 40 percent of the income, while unemployment was over 25 percent. This set the stage for the Nazi party's ascent.[161]

# 1933: Preinauguration

Gold continued to flow out of the country in anticipation of Roosevelt's reflationary policies, and Roosevelt now refused to reaffirm his commitment to the gold standard. Those around him attempted to persuade him to reassure the markets. Senator Carter Glass, who was Roosevelt's likely nominee for Secretary of the Treasury, declared that he would not accept the post if Roosevelt could not guarantee the country would stay on the gold standard.[162] Hoover wrote a personal letter to Roosevelt, requesting that he clarify his policies.[163] European investors in the dollar were worried: From Paris, the New York Times reported that "the confusion of mind in Europe's markets concerning the future tendency of the dollar must be ascribed to lack of information regarding the definite intentions of the new American government. Declaration by Mr. Roosevelt declaring firm resolution to maintain a sound currency would have an extremely reassuring effect." But Roosevelt stayed silent.[164]

In February, the crisis deepened. Facing bankruptcy, the Guardian Detroit Union Group, the largest financial institution in Michigan, sought a loan from the RFC. The group had little good collateral, so the RFC could not, under its mandate, offer it a large loan. Perhaps more importantly, the main shareholder of the Guardian Group was auto millionaire Henry Ford. Not wanting the appearance of doing more favors for fat-cats, the RFC suggested that it could make a loan if Ford also provided some support. But Ford, recognizing that the Guardian Trust was as systemically important as the Central Republic, refused. His attempt to call the RFC's bluff failed. The Union Guardian Trust and Guardian National Bank of Commerce, two of the Guardian Group's banks, were allowed to go bankrupt and Michigan was forced to declare a statewide bank holiday.[165]

When policy makers fail to rescue systemically important institutions, the ripple effects can quickly spread to the whole system. Since Michigan was part of America's industrial heartland, the impact on other states was especially large.[166] Households and companies rushed to withdraw their savings from banks across the country. Ohio, Arkansas, and Indiana suffered bank runs. Maryland declared a bank holiday on February 25, and by March 4, there were withdrawal restrictions in over 30 states.[167]

The flow of gold out of the country turned into a wave. In the last two weeks of February, the New York Fed lost 250 million, almost a quarter of its gold reserves.[168]

Current Banking Developments

"Demand upon the reserve banks for currency in connection with holiday trade this year was about  \$120,000,000, compared with$ 225,000,000 to  $275,000,000 in other recent years. This decreased demand for currency reflected both a diminished dollar volume of retail trade, due chiefly to the prevailing lower level of prices, and a continued return of currency from hoarding. The demand for currency did not result this year, as it usually does, in an increase in the outstanding volume of reserve bank credit, since additions of about\$ 150,000,000 of gold to the country's monetary stock were more than sufficient to provide to member banks the funds necessary for meeting currency withdrawals."

On Sunday, March 5, the day after he took office, Roosevelt declared a national four-day bank holiday, suspended gold exports (effectively delinking the dollar from gold), and set a team to work on rescuing the banking system. It was a scramble to get as much done as possible in as short a time as possible.

Before the banks were set to reopen on March 9, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act of 1933. The act extended the bank holiday and gave the Fed and the Treasury unprecedented powers to provide liquidity and capital to the banking system. Most important, the act granted the Fed the ability to issue dollars that were backed by bank assets instead of gold, which broke the link between the dollar and gold and allowed the Fed to print money and provide the liquidity that banks desperately needed. So that the Fed could print money without facing a run on its gold reserves, Roosevelt banned gold exports under the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act.[171]

Auditors began to work through the books of each US bank, starting with the largest banks and those known to be the safest. When auditors found a bank that was undercapitalized, they could either (a) recapitalize the bank by having the RFC issue preferred shares, (b) merge it with a healthier bank, or (c) close it. Systemically important banks were always supported, while smaller banks were often allowed to fail. Once auditors decided that a bank was sound, it would reopen with the ability to borrow from the Fed using any of its assets as collateral.[172] As part of the Banking Act of 1933, the Treasury agreed to cover any losses the Fed incurred, effectively guaranteeing the liabilities of every bank that they chose to keep open.[173]

On Sunday, March 12, the night before the first wave of banks was set to reopen, Roosevelt gave a nationwide radio address explaining the plan for the banks and seeking to restore trust in the banking system:

The new law allows the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks which reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call…It is sound currency because it is backed by actual, good assets…I can assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress.[174]

As banks in twelve cities prepared to open on Monday, policy makers and investors waited nervously to see how the public would respond. Instead of bank runs, the public proceeded to deposit more than 1 billion into the banks, which is a classic example of how debt and liquidity problems prompted by runs can be rectified by providing liquidity rather than holding it back. Banks continued to reopen in the days that followed, and within a month member banks representing 90 percent of the deposits in the system had reopened.[175] When markets finally opened on Wednesday, the Dow rose 15.3 percent and commodities also soared.

To get all that money, the link to gold had to be broken. But with all that printing, the dollar's value plunged against both other currencies and gold. This was virtually identical to what happened in August 1971, when I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and thought that the crisis would send the stock market and economy down. What happened was the same as what happened in 1933, and for the same reasons, but I hadn't studied what happened in 1933, so I was painfully wrong. That was the first time that I was surprised by events that hadn't happened in my lifetime but had happened many times in history. Being stung by these experiences drove me to try to understand all big market and economic movements in all time frames and all economies and to have timeless and universal principles for dealing with them. That saved my butt a number of times (e.g., in 2008). The events I am describing to you that happened in the 1930s have happened many times before for the exact same reasons.

Within two weeks of leaving the gold peg, the Federal Reserve was able to decrease its liquidity injections; short-term rates decreased by one percent to two percent, bankers' acceptance rates dropped back to two percent, and call loan rates decreased to three percent.[176] The money supply increased by 1.5 percent over the next three months, and the Dow was up by almost 100 percent over the next four months. These moves ended the depression on a dime. (Most people mistakenly think that the depression lasted through the 1930s until World War II so I want to be clear on what actually happened. It is correct that it took until 1936 for GDP to match its 1929 peak. But when you look at the numbers in the charts below, you can see that leaving the gold peg was the turning point; it was exactly then that all markets and economic statistics bottomed. Still, these average numbers can be misleading because the recovery benefited the rich more than the poor, and the post-1933 period remained more difficult for a lot of people than the averages suggest, which is likely why people often think of the depression as lasting through the entire decade.)

While leaving the gold standard, printing money, and providing guarantees were by far the most impactful policy moves that Roosevelt made, they were just the first of an avalanche of policies that were unrolled during his first six months in office. The shock and awe of all those big announcements of spending, coming week after week, built confidence among investors and the public, which was critical to putting the economy on a good footing. I'll describe some of those policies below, not because the particulars are all that important, but because together they paint the picture of a bold, multifaceted, and comprehensive policy push.

While they were still working to shore up the banks, policy makers shifted their attentions to significantly increasing financial industry regulation and oversight. Changing laws in ways that would have made the last crisis less bad are typical at the end of big debt crises. When you read through them, focus on how they map to the template for handling debt problems.

- April 5 and 18: Roosevelt took additional steps to unlink the dollar from gold. First he outlawed ownership of monetary gold by the public through an executive order. Two weeks later, he outlawed private gold exports and indicated support for legislation that would allow him to set the price of gold.[177] (devaluing and printing money)
May 27: Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1933, which would regulate the sale of securities.[178] (increased regulation)
- June 5: Congress banned the relatively common "Gold Clauses" in contracts, a provision that allowed the payee to opt to be paid in gold. Since gold had increased in value after the dollar was delinked from it, this amounted to a big restructuring of debts.[179] (restructuring debts)

- June 13: The Home Owner's Loan Act established the Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) to assist in the refinancing of residential mortgages. Between 1933 and 1935, one million people received long term loans through the agency.[180] (restructuring debts)
- June 16: The Banking Act of 1933 (i.e., Glass-Stegall II) provided deposit insurance of up to 2,500 through the newly formed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It also empowered the Fed to regulate interest rates on demand and savings deposits (Regulation Q); set forth stringent regulations for banks; and required the separation of investment and commercial banking functions.[181] (establish deposit insurance, increased regulation)

Roosevelt also announced new federal agencies and programs that added up to an unprecedented fiscal stimulus. Federal spending had fallen by more than  \$1 billion in 1932 as Hoover tightened fiscal policy in an attempt to balance the budget. Even though he initially campaigned to balance the budget, FDR's policies would end up increasing annual spending by\$ 2.7 billion (5 percent of GDP) by 1934. These are some of the early stimulus bills:

- April 5: Established the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which would employ 2.5 million people in public works projects over its nine years of existence.[182]
May 12: Established the Federal Emergency Relief Act to provide financial support to households with an initial funding of 500 million.[183]
May 18: The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) undertook massive infrastructure investment, providing power, flood control, and irrigation in one of the regions most affected by the Great Depression.[184]
- June 16: The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) created the Public Works Administration (PWA), which had 3.3 billion at its disposal to spend on large-scale public works.[185]

As a result of all of this stimulation, deflation turned into acceptable rather than horrible inflation.

As explained in the "Archetypal Long-Term Debt Cycle" section, balance is key in achieving a "beautiful deleveraging": Deleveragings become beautiful when there is enough stimulation to offset the deflationary forces and to bring the nominal growth rate above the nominal interest rate.

The economy roared to life over the next three months as terribly depressed levels of activity quickly became less terrible. Heavy machinery orders climbed by 100 percent, and industrial production increased by almost 50 percent.

Between March and July nondurable manufacturing production increased 35 percent while durable manufacturing increased 83 percent. Unemployment fell and over the next three months, wholesale prices jumped by 45 percent.[186]

These were all rebounding from very depressed levels and fed on themselves to make a beautiful deleveraging.

# 1935: The Goldilocks Period

The economy and the markets continued to recover through 1934 and into 1935, when the Federal Reserve began contemplating tightening once again. By 1935 the economy had recovered, deflation had disappeared, and stock prices had soared as a result of the Fed's earlier policies. At the time, home prices were rising faster than 10 percent per year, and the recovery in equity prices was even faster. The boost to wealth was big, though wealth and economic output remained below pre-depression, bubble levels.

Caution Discerned in Reserves Policy

"The joint statement issued in Washington last Wednesday by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the system's open-market committee, indicating that no immediate action to reduce excess bank reserves was contemplated, was regarded in Wall Street as the most important pronouncement of Federal Reserve policy in years."

New York Times

In the spring of 1935, the Fed became increasingly concerned about the rise in excess reserves.[187] It feared that the surge in excess reserves could create an expansion in credit and inflation in the future. In March, a background memo was prepared to address the question of what the Fed should do. It recommended no action for the time being. The paper explored the question of whether excess reserves will encourage banks to lend more to the private sector by pushing down the yield on government securities, but it didn't yet see evidence of that happening, so the Fed held pat. A second issue the paper looked at was how to sell the debt that it accumulated (i.e., how to do a reverse Q.E.).[188] The paper rejected doing this for the time being, expressing the view that it would prematurely give too much weight to inflation concerns that hadn't yet shown signs of materializing, and instead advocated encouraging the expansion.

The cyclical expansion and advances in the stock market and housing price gains continued, which caused the Fed to become more inclined to tighten. In October, another memo expressed heightened concerns over the excess reserves, pondering the appropriate time to reduce them and whether to do that through 1) asset sales or 2) increasing the reserve requirement. In November, the pros and cons of these paths were explored. The argument for reducing excess reserves was to get ahead of the potential for future inflation; the argument against it was that there was no evidence yet for restraint.

In its press release of November 22, the Fed discussed the stock market boom and expressed concerns about inflation. Fears of fueling a bubble were rampant because a number of policy makers, including FDR, remembered that the bubble of the late 1920s caused the stock market bust, which had contributed to the depression. As a result, they were very worried that the steep rise in the stock market in 1935 (nearly a quadrupling!) could fuel a recurrence. The November press release from the Treasury disagreed, noting that inflation was still far off.[189]

The Fed paid a lot of attention to how the stock purchases were being financed because they had heightened concerns about "speculative credit" after the excess in margin-borrowing during the late 1920s. Raising margin requirements was considered. However, the November Fed memo noted that the purchases were being financed by money, not credit, so no action was taken.[190] Still, the stock market advance was considered an emerging bubble, and fears about too easy of a monetary policy remained, so the arguments about whether or not to apply restraints continued. One board member (George Harrison of the New York Fed) suggested raising reserve requirements to curtail the rise in stock prices. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau (still on the Fed Board at the time) rejected this notion. However, he recognized the concern that a rise in reserves could lead to inflation. In December, Emanuel Goldenweiser, the Fed's head of research, warned of a potential negative psychological reaction to raising reserve requirements. He recommended that the Fed issue a press release saying that any action on reserve requirements would be "precautionary" in nature, and thought that "there is no need to worry about inflation at this time with the very large volume of unused plant capacity and unemployment." At the end of 1935, following its last meeting, the Fed issued a press release stating that the volume of reserves and gold inflows "continues to be excessive" and warned that "appropriate action may be taken as soon as it appears in the public interest."[191]

# 1936-1938: The Tightening Causes Recession

The debate continued at the start of 1936. FDR wanted to signal a concern around inflation ahead of the election, so he urged that reserve requirements be tightened that spring. Fed Chairman Eccles was worried that banks would accumulate a lot of bonds and loans at low rates and then get burned by inflation.[192]

In May the Fed did not move. While the Banking Act of 1935 meant Treasury Secretary Morgenthau had to resign from the board, he still had influence and was a strong proponent against acting. By that July, Fed Chairman Eccles met alone with FDR, explaining his intention to raise reserves and assuring the president he would not act if he felt interest rates would rise and that the Fed would buy bonds if they sold off. The Fed tightened reserves later that month. Eccles and the Fed moved without informing Morgenthau, who was furious. After a tiny sell off in bonds, Morgenthau ordered Harrison of the New York Fed to purchase bonds using the Treasury's accounts. The Fed Board in Washington joined in, buying bonds and selling bills as Eccles had promised the president.[193] Between August 1936 and May 1937, the Fed doubled reserve requirements from about 8 percent to 16 percent, as shown below. The first tightening, in August 1936, did not hurt stock prices or the economy.

It is typically the case that the first tightening does not hurt stocks and the economy.

Because the tightening did not have an effect, reserves were tightened more in two additional phases, the first in March 1937 and the second in May 1937. The largest increase was the first (about half the total), as shown below.

As a result of the reserve tightening, excess reserves fell from  \$3 billion to less than\$ 1 billion.[194]

The tightening of monetary policy was intensified by currency devaluations by France and Switzerland, continuing a battle of official devaluations to gain price and trade advantages. In September 1936, the Tripartite Agreement was reached by the United States, Britain, and France, which essentially stated that each nation would refrain from competitive exchange devaluations.[195] By then, it had become obvious that all countries could just as easily devalue their currencies in response to other devaluations, creating a huge amount of economic turbulence that left everyone in the same place. At the end of the day, all currencies had devalued a lot against gold, but not so much against each other.

London Unruffled by Our Gold Move: U.S. Treasury's Sterilizing Action Is Considered a Sound Policy

"The decision of the United States Treasury to sterilize gold imports caused no surprise here in financial circles. It is regarded as merely another step toward giving active expression to the already announced official determination to check unwanted credit inflation or an unrestrained stock market boom."

-New York Times

By 1936, war was brewing in Europe, driving capital flight to the US, which continued to fuel advances in stocks and the economy. That year, the president and other policy makers were becoming increasingly concerned by gold inflows (which allowed faster money and credit growth).[196] The concerns were threefold:

1. The rapid rise in the stock market. At this time, stocks were up almost four times from their bottom in 1933 and were rising fast: by about 40 percent in 1935 and 25 percent in 1936. Policy makers worried that the gold inflows were coming from foreigners bringing in capital to buy US stocks.
2. The inflationary impact of gold inflows increasing the monetary base. Inflation had risen from roughly 0 percent to around 2 percent in October 1936.
3. The US was becoming vulnerable to an outflow of gold (i.e., capital withdrawal). The specific concern was that the European nations would finance the coming war in part by selling their US assets and pulling gold out, while preventing US holders of their assets from repatriating capital.

To neutralize the effects of these inflows, in December, FDR ordered "sterilization" to begin. Normally, when people sold their gold to the US government in exchange for dollars, the number of dollars increased (i.e., money is printed), which, given the strong economic recovery, wasn't seen as desirable. Instead, starting December 23, the gold inflows/newly mined gold were sterilized—literally, the Treasury purchased gold inflows by drawing down its cash account at the Federal Reserve instead of printing money. From the end of 1936 to July 1937, the Treasury sterilized about 1.3 billion of gold inflows (approximately 1.5 percent of GDP).[197] We can see the increase in sterilization and slowing of gold and other asset purchases in 1936/37 with money growth slowing and dropping below gold reserve growth. The Fed also tightened reserve requirements in order to take money out of circulation, as we have seen.

# 1937

The economy remained strong going into early 1937. The stock market was still rising, industrial production remained healthy, and inflation picked up to around 5 percent. The second tightening came in March 1937 and the third in May. While neither the Fed nor the Treasury anticipated that the increase in required reserves combined with the sterilization program would push rates higher, the tighter money and reduced liquidity led to a sell-off in bonds and a rise in the short rate.[198] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau was furious and argued that the Fed should offset the "panic" through open market operations to make net purchases of bonds. He ordered the Treasury into the market to purchase bonds itself. Fed Chairman Eccles pushed back on Morgenthau, urging him to balance the budget and raise tax rates to begin to retire debt.[199]

Additionally there was a fiscal tightening. Federal government outlays fell 10 percent in 1937 and another 10 percent in 1938. The Revenue Act of 1937 was passed to help to close loopholes in the Revenue Act of 1935 (which was sold as the "wealth tax").[200] That act had increased the federal income tax for the highest incomes up to 75 percent.

The federal budget deficit went from around -4 percent of GDP to neutral. The reversal in the budget in 1937 was a consequence of a large increase in taxes, mostly from a rise in the Social Security tax, along with sizable but smaller cuts in spending.[201]

There was significant pressure on the government to pass redistributive policies, as the recovery thus far was perceived to be uneven (i.e., benefiting the elites over the common man). Workers saw the gains in corporate profits, but didn't see a subsequent increase in their own compensation. Inequality bred discontent, as evidenced by the sharp increase in the number and intensity of strikes from 1936 to 1937 (the number of strikes rose by 118 percent and the number of workers involved by 136 percent).[202]

In financial markets, the combination of monetary and fiscal tightening created a significant sell-off in risky assets. Stocks fell the most, but home prices stopped their gains and dipped negative. Credit growth slowed as well, both in aggregate and across all sectors. Nonfinancial business credit creation fell to almost -2 percent, and household credit creation was slightly less negative at about -1 percent. Spending and economic activity fell as a result. With that downturn, unemployment rose to 15 percent, though it was more like a short uptick, especially in comparison to the punishingly high rise at the start of the decade. Stocks bottomed a year later, in April 1938, declining a total of nearly 60 percent!

# Recent Banking Developments

Total deposits at weekly reporting member banks continued to decrease in April and May, reflecting declines in bankers' balances and in United States Government deposits. Other deposits, which had declined somewhat in March, increased slightly in the following weeks. Sales of securities by banks have been the most important factor in accounting for the decrease in deposits in recent months. Member bank holdings of United States Government obligations continued to decline at New York City banks during April and May, but the decline was less rapid than in earlier months, and holdings of other reporting banks showed little change. Commercial loans by banks increased further, although after the first week of April the rapid growth of previous weeks slackened."

# Late 1937-1938: Policy Makers Reverse Their Course

As markets and the economy turned down in 1937, the Fed accelerated a twist into longer-dated assets and started to do a small amount of net asset purchases. By the end of the year, the Treasury began to reverse its sterilization program in partnership with the Fed.[203] Money growth picked up again starting in 1938 and continued to rise with the reverse sterilization and renewed money printing. At the same time, gold inflows slowed and the economy and asset prices deteriorated. Before long, money growth had outpaced growth in gold reserves.

The Fed's twist is shown below. While the Fed didn't do much in the way of net asset purchases, it accelerated its buying of long-term bonds in 1937 while selling bills and notes (a process it had actually started in 1936). It also increased net assets by a small amount (slightly above 3 percent by 1938).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/e2e7cb065e54b16cb4535fdfa65db2f372a99dbc0a854911e48733cdf648d5d0.jpg)

Fed Balance Sheet Public Debt Assets (\% 1936 GDP)

In the spring of 1938, the Fed added to the stimulus by lowering its reserve requirements back to 1936 levels, releasing about 750 million.[204] The federal government also increased deficit spending that year and again in 1939 heading into the war. While the government was almost running a balanced budget at the start of 1938, the deficit rose to almost 3 percent of GDP by the start of 1939. Deficit spending above 2 percent of GDP continued throughout the year.

In 1938, the stock market began to recover, though stocks didn't fully regain their 1937 highs until the end of the war nearly a decade later. Credit flows and the economy also recovered in 1939, following the stimulus and entry into the war.

# The Path to War

While the purpose of this chapter has been to examine the debt and economic circumstances in the United States during the 1930s, the linkages between economic conditions and political conditions, both within the United States and between the United States and other countries—most importantly Germany and Japan—cannot be ignored because economics and geopolitics were very intertwined at the time. Most importantly, Germany and Japan had internal conflicts between the haves (the Right) and the have-nots (the Left), which led to more populist, autocratic, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders who were given special autocratic powers by their democracies to bring order to their badly-managed economies. They also faced external economic and military conflicts arising as these countries became rival economic and military powers to existing world powers.

The case is also a good example of Thucydides's Trap—where rivalries between countries lead to wars in order to establish which country is more powerful, which are then followed by periods of peace in which the dominant power/powers get to set the rules because no country can fight them until a rival power emerges, at which time they do it all over again.

To help to convey the picture in the 1930s, I will quickly run though the geopolitical highlights of what happened from 1930 until the official start of the war in Europe in 1939 and the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. While 1939 and 1941 are known as the official start of the wars in Europe and the Pacific, the wars really started about 10 years before that, as economic conflicts that were at first limited progressively grew into World War II. As Germany and Japan became more expansionist economic and military powers, they increasingly competed with the UK, US, and France for both resources and influence over territories. That eventually led to the war, which culminated in it being clear which country (the United States) had the power to dictate the new world order. This has led to a period of peace under that world order and will continue until the same process happens again.

# More precisely:

In 1930, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff began a trade war.

In 1931, Japan's resources were inadequate, and its rural poverty became severe, so it invaded Manchuria, China to obtain natural resources. The US wanted to keep China free from Japanese control and was competing for natural resources—especially oil, rubber, and tin—from Southeast Asia, while at the same time Japan and the US had significant trade with each other.

In 1931, the depression in Japan was so severe that it drove Japan off the gold standard, leading to both the floating of the yen (which depreciated greatly) and big fiscal and monetary expansions that led to Japan being the first country to experience a recovery and strong growth (which lasted until 1937).

- In 1932, there was a lot of internal conflict in Japan, which led to a failed coup and a massive upsurge in right-wing nationalism and militarism. During the period from 1931 to 1937, the military took over control of the government and increased its top-down command of the economy.

In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany as a populist promising to exercise control over the bad economy, to bring order to the political chaos of the democracy of the time, and to fight the communists. Within just two months of being named chancellor, he was able to take total authoritarian control; using the excuse of national security, he got the Reichstag to pass the Enabling Act, which gave him virtually unlimited powers (in part by locking up political opponents and also by convincing some moderates that it was necessary). He promptly refused to make reparations payments, stepped out of the League of Nations, and took control of the media. To create a strong economy and attempt to bring prosperity to the people, he created a top-down command economy. For instance, Hitler was involved with setting up Volkswagen to build a more affordable car, and directed the building of the national German Autobahn (highway system). He believed that Germany's potential was limited by its geographic boundaries, that it didn't have adequate raw materials to feed the industrial military complex, and that German people should be ethnically united.

- At the same time, Japan became increasingly strong with its top-down command economy, building a military industrial complex, with the military intended to protect its bases in East Asia and Northern China and to expand its controls over other territories.

Germany also got stronger by building its military industrial complex and looking to expand and claim adjacent lands.

In 1934, there was severe famine in parts of Japan, causing even more political turbulence and reinforcing the right-wing militaristic and nationalistic movement. Because the free market wasn't working for the people, that led to the strengthening of the command economy.

In 1936, Germany took back the Rhineland militarily, and in 1938, it annexed Austria.

In 1936, Japan signed a pact with Germany.

- In 1936-7, the Fed tightened, which caused the fragile economy to weaken, and other major economies weakened with it.
- In 1937, Japan's occupation of China spread, and the second Sino-Japanese War began. The Japanese took over Shanghai and Nanking, killing an estimated 200,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants in the capture of Nanking alone. The United States provided China's Chiang Kai-shek government with fighter planes and pilots to fight the Japanese, thus putting a toe in the war.
In 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and World War II in Europe officially began.
In 1940, Germany captured Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France.
- During this time, most companies in Germany and Japan remained publicly owned, but their production was controlled by their respective governments in support of the war.
- In 1940, Henry Stimson became the US Secretary of War. He increasingly used aggressive economic sanctions against Japan, culminating in the Export Control Act of July 2, 1940. In October, he ramped up the embargo, restricting "all iron and steel to destinations other than Britain and nations of the Western Hemisphere."
- Beginning in September 1940, to obtain more resources and take advantage of the European preoccupation with the war on their continent, Japan invaded several colonies in Southeast Asia, starting with French Indochina. In 1941, Japan extended its reach by seizing oil reserves in the Dutch East Indies to add the "Southern Resource Zone" to its "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The "Southern Resource Zone" was a collection of mostly European colonies in Southeast Asia, whose conquest would afford Japan access to key natural resources (most importantly oil, rubber, and rice). The latter, the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," was a bloc of Asian countries controlled by Japan, not (as they previously were) the Western powers.
Japan then occupied a naval base near the Philippine capital, Manila. This threatened an attack on the Philippines, which was, at the time, an American protectorate.
- In 1941, to aid the Allies without fully entering the war, the United States began its Lend-Lease policy. Under this policy, the United States sent oil, food, and weaponry to the Allied Nations for free. This aid totaled over 650 billion in today's dollars. The Lend-Lease policy, although not an outright declaration of war, ended the United States' neutrality.
In the summer of 1941, US President Roosevelt ordered the freezing of all Japanese assets in the United States and embargoed all oil and gas exports to Japan. Japan calculated that it would be out of oil in two years.
- In December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and British and Dutch colonies in Asia. While it didn't have a plan to win the war, it wanted to destroy the Pacific Fleet that threatened Japan. Japan supposedly also believed that the US was weakened by both fighting a war in two fronts (Europe and the US) and by its political system; Japan thought that totalitarianism and the command military industrial complex approaches of their country and Germany were superior to the individualistic/capitalist approach of the United States.

These events led to the "war economy" conditions explained at the end of Part 1.

# US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

# US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

This section provides a detailed account of the most recent big US debt crisis, focusing on the period from 2007 to 2011. It was written with reference to the template laid out in the "Archetypal Big Debt Cycle" section but also pays close attention to the enormous number of particulars that occurred during this period. Please note how well the particulars of this case fit with the generalizations described in the template. For example, when you read about the pooling and securitization of mortgages, the levering up of investment banks, and the rapid growth of derivatives that were traded off of regulated exchanges, see these as new ways of providing leverage outside the protection and regulation of authorities. If you don't make the connection between the particulars of this case and the generalization, then you will miss how classic this debt crisis really was.

In providing you with this narrative, I'm also hoping to convey an up-close feeling of what it was like to go through the experience day-by-day. I encourage you, at each point, to think about what you would do a) as an investor and b) as a policy maker. I will give you that experience by describing the timeline week-by-week (and sometimes day-by-day), while showing on the sides of each page a "newsfeed" (primarily New York Times articles). I will also include excerpts from Bridgewater Daily Observations, which show what we were thinking at the time. However, I will not describe how we moved our investment positions around because how we do that is proprietary. Because there is so much here, I've organized it so that it's easy to skim by reading just the bold passages.

# The Emerging Bubble: 2004-2006

In the early and healthy part of the typical debt cycle, debt grows appropriately in line with income growth because the debt is being used to finance activities that produce fast income growth to service debts. The debt-to-GDP ratio is a proxy of whether or not this is happening in a balanced way, but a rough one because, at first, the amount of income a debt will produce is a matter of conjecture. During the 1990s, debt-to-GDP ratios increased only a little in the US—and it was a period of relatively strong income growth and low unemployment. The 2001 recession, which was caused by the tightening of monetary policy, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and the shock of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, prompted the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates all the way from 6.5 percent to 1 percent. Note how close the US rate was to 0 percent at this point. The big rate cuts stimulated borrowing and spending, especially by households. This made the 2001 recession a short-lived and shallow one, but it set the stage for the subsequent bubble period, which was building most rapidly between 2004 and 2006.

During this period, US economic conditions looked excellent by most measures. Growth was relatively steady at 3 to 4 percent, the unemployment rate was below its long term average at between 4 and 5 percent, and inflation was mostly between 2 and 3.5 percent—a bit higher than desirable, but not worrisome by traditional measures. At the same time, the economy was classically entering its "late cycle" phase as capacity constraints began to appear (e.g., the GDP gap was 2 percent and growth in demand was above growth in capacity). Financial and housing markets were very strong, financed by debt.

# The U.S. Housing Bubble

The US housing market started to look frothy a few years back and now looks to us to be in a full-blown bubble. The housing market has been a major source of strength to the US economy, and the popping of this bubble would have more dire consequences than an equity market fall. Selling one's house at a loss can be very traumatic—it is the largest and most leveraged asset of the household sector. Losing equity in one's house can devastatingly destroy the household sector's net worth, and losing more than one's equity can paralyze the economy (e.g., most people couldn't sell their homes, which means that they couldn't move).

May 25, 2005

# Steep Rise in Prices for Homes Adds to Worry About a Bubble

Home prices rose more quickly over the last year than at any point since 1980, a national group of Realtors reported yesterday, raising new questions about whether some local housing markets may be turning into bubbles destined to burst…Over all, home prices have never fallen by a significant amount, and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Friday that a national drop in price remained unlikely.

-New York Times

The Federal Reserve, focusing on growth, inflation, and the GDP gap more than debt growth, increased interest rates gradually, from the lows of 1 percent in 2004 to just over 5 percent in 2006.

That was not enough to slow debt-financed asset appreciation. Over those three years, the S&P 500 returned 35 percent, as earnings grew by 32 percent. While these 10 percent per year gains were good, they were not anywhere near the gains seen during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. With the economy strong, inflation moderate, and asset prices appreciating well, the economy appeared to most people as though it was in a "Goldilocks" period—not too hot and not too cold. Debt/GDP grew at an average rate of 12.6 percent during the period. Typically that's when bubbles emerge because central banks focus on inflation and growth (which isn't a problem) and they don't adequately worry about debt-financed purchases of investment assets.

Because debt bubbles typically emerge in one or a couple of markets, they are often hidden beneath the averages and can only be seen by doing pro forma financial stress tests of the significant areas to see how they would hold up and what the knock-on effects of them not holding up would be.

# The Housing Market Debt Bubble

In this case, the most important area in which the bubble was emerging was housing. From 2004 to 2006, home prices increased around 30 percent and had increased more than 80 percent since 2000, supported by increasingly liberal lending practices. That was the fastest pace of real housing price increases in a century, except for the immediate post-WWII period. The price rise was classically self-reinforcing in a way that often creates bubbles. Because most houses are bought with borrowed money, home price gains have magnified impacts on equity values. For example, if a household used their savings of  \$50,000 as a down-payment on a\$ 250,000 house, and that house went up in value to 350,000, then the household's investment tripled. This allowed for more borrowing and attracted other buyers and other lenders to finance them, as this lending was very profitable.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/0d68fe917aadb79bf8245bd3a17c3200b57d7a1302896722ccf1fff2fa39afcb.jpg)

Household debt rose from 85 percent of household disposable income in 2000 to about 120 percent in 2006. Credit standards were lowered, and while all income quintiles increased their debt substantially over the period, the biggest percentage increase in debt between 2001 and 2007 was among borrowers in the bottom quintile of income earners. As mortgage lending practices became more liberal, even non-home buyers ran up debts by borrowing against their home equity—home equity loans and cash-out refinancing totaled 500 billion in 2005, up five times compared to 1998.^{2} That pushed overall US debt to over 300 percent of GDP.

The more prices went up, the more credit standards were lowered (even though it would have been logical for the opposite to happen), but both lenders and borrowers found lending and buying houses on borrowed money to be very profitable. The credit-fueled buying drove up prices even more, creating self-reinforcing expectations and drawing in new borrowers/ lenders who did not want to miss out on the action. This is classic in bubble periods.

The US housing market was showing every sign of a classic bubble. To repeat my defining characteristics of a bubble:

NaN. Prices are high relative to traditional measures.

NaN. Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels.

NaN. There is broad bullish sentiment.

NaN. Purchases are being financed by high leverage.

NaN. Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g., built inventory, contracted forward purchases, etc.) to speculate or protect themselves against future price gains.

NaN. New buyers (i.e., those who weren't previously in the market) have entered the market.

NaN. Stimulative monetary policy helps inflate the bubble, and tight policy contributes to its popping.

All of these were true for the US housing market. Prices rose quickly and were widely expected to continue doing so (e.g., "home flippers" would buy a home, do some renovations, and aim to take advantage of rising prices to make a short-term profit). Homebuilders were ramping up supply that wouldn't come on line for months or years, in anticipation of high prices being sustained—new single family home construction doubled between 1995 and 2005. As people saw their friends and neighbors becoming richer through homeownership, more people wanted to buy homes. At the peak of the bubble, just shy of 8 percent of households were buying a home each year (around 50 percent more than today). A TIME magazine cover from the summer of 2005 (roughly the peak) conveyed the speculative mania, asking "Will Your House Make You Rich?"

In other words, there was leveraging up to bet more aggressively on prices continuing to increase. At the same time, supplies were increasing as the higher prices encouraged production. Logic should dictate precisely the opposite behavior: those betting on price changes ought to be more inclined to deleverage or sell, and those who lend to them should be more cautious when these things are happening. However, this sort of nonsensical thinking is typical in bubbles.

Just as there was a mania to buy houses, there was a mania to lend to people to buy houses. The chart on the left on the next page shows aggregate mortgage rates. As a result of the Fed's easy monetary policies, they fell to lows in 2003 not seen since the 1950s, and stayed near those lows well into the housing bubble. Leveraging up took off in 2003-2007, even after rates rose by about 1.5 percent in 2005-2007. The chart on the right shows the loan-to-value ratio of new housing loans—higher numbers mean mortgages had smaller down-payments and larger loans. The fast increase to 80 percent was an indication that banks were more eager to loan and willing to make riskier bets. Other signs of housing loan froth were common. Banks often didn't require borrowers to show proof of income before receiving a mortgage and they pushed adjustable rate mortgages that enticed borrowers with low "teaser" rates now before rates increased later on. "Subprime" mortgages (e.g., riskier ones) became 20 percent of the market. And as we'll discuss later in much more detail, banks were able to package this debt in ways that obscured its underlying risks (i.e., "securitization"), helping fuel the easy availability of credit and low interest rates.

For all of the debt build-up and frenzied housing activity, the economy didn't overheat and inflation remained moderate, so the Fed, looking at the average numbers, remained unconcerned. It is typically the case that the worst debt bubbles (e.g., the US in 1929, Japan in 1989) are not accompanied by high and rising goods and services inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth. Typically, central banks make the mistake of accommodating the debt growth because they are focused on goods and services inflation (as measured by the CPI) and/or growth. They are not focused on debt growth, which is what they are creating, and on whether the debts will produce the incomes to service them, which is what they should be thinking about if they want to prevent bad debt crises.

As you can see in the charts below, as inflation was mostly between 2 and 3.5 percent—a bit higher than desirable but not worrisome—the Fed kept interest rates low well into the expansion. In fact, US short-term interest rates were below inflation (i.e., real short-term borrowing costs were negative) from late 2001 until early 2006. Even when the Fed did begin raising short-term rates in mid-2004, long-term nominal interest rates remained roughly flat, and real long-term interest rates declined.

For all these reasons, a global financial bubble was emerging.

In the middle of 2006, Hank Paulson was confirmed as George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary. He came to that job from the position of chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, which gave him an exposure to the markets that made him generally concerned about the excesses in the financial markets, so he convened and held regular meetings with the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which was comprised of the top members of the Bush economic team and key regulators.4 The primary benefit of these meetings was that they built close working relationships among the members, most importantly between Paulson, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, and New York Fed President Tim Geithner, and their agencies.

In all financial crises, the personalities, capabilities, and ability to work well together play crucial roles in influencing the outcomes. In this case, the most important relationships were between Paulson (an extroverted former CEO who was used to making bold decisions), Bernanke (an introverted economist who was well-schooled in the Great Depression), and Geithner (a practical operator experienced in the workings of government economic policy making). Their complementary qualities, in combination with their often hourly coordination and their shared willingness to be bold and quickly evolve policies based on new learnings, were critical to their navigating through this crisis.

While all three men had concerns about the "dry tinder and gathering storm," and tried to lean against the excesses that they perceived, the problems weren't clear enough to them to prompt them to move quickly or forcefully enough to prevent what was to come. They noted the excesses in the subprime market, but none saw these excesses spilling over to the overall housing market, which had not seen a nationwide decline since World War II. Paulson, however, was very concerned about the risks posed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (known as Government Supported Entities, or GSEs), which Larry Summers also highlighted when he was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. That prompted Paulson to get President Bush's support in the fall of 2006 to begin working on legislation with Barney Frank (then the ranking minority member of the House Financial Services Committee) to reform those entities, though that push didn't lead to progress until the crisis came to a head in the summer of 2008.[5]

# The Emerging Broader-Based Bubble

The broader economy also showed signs of a bubble. Savings rates declined from low to lower and the US aggressively sucked in capital from abroad. US manufacturing employment fell and the US was rapidly losing global export market share to emerging countries, especially China. However, the increase in housing-related activity camouflaged this; for instance, construction employment in support of building houses increasingly financed by debt rose by around 50 percent compared to 1995.

In addition, a lot of money to fund consumption was also borrowed via mortgages and other types of debt instruments. High debt growth to fund consumption rather than investment is a red flag, since consumption doesn't produce an income, while investment might.

Home builders, struggling to keep ahead in a weakening market, cut prices and offered a variety of other discounts in September to help sell their newly constructed houses, the latest government and industry statistics show.

"The truth is that the official numbers on house prices—the last refuge of soothing information about the real estate market on the coasts—are deeply misleading. Depending on which set you look at, you'll see that prices have either continued to rise, albeit modestly, or have fallen slightly over the last year. But the statistics have a number of flaws, perhaps the biggest being that they are based only on homes that have actually sold."

-New York Times

Typical of such periods, a lot of foreign money came pouring in to participate in the bubble, as reflected in both capital inflows and our current account deficit swelling (to 6 percent of GDP). A lot of this money was coming from emerging economies such as China, which were running huge current account surpluses at the time and were choosing to save/invest in US assets. Strong capital inflows allowed US citizens to borrow so they could continue consuming more than they were earning.

Strong demand for US assets abroad also helped keep long-term borrowing costs low even as the Fed began raising short-term interest rates in late 2004.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/123868387ddf595f4a6904b7fc5a2b367571670a4d3db8723e9772a820942681.jpg)

Many of these flows went to lending that would not produce the income to service the debts. They supported a dynamic that was unsustainable: The savings rate can't fall indefinitely, and the wave of lending can't increase forever. As the debts came due, there would be cash flow problems. When we ran our pro forma financial numbers, we could see that when all these flows tapered off, there would be cash flow problems.

During this period, lending increased and became riskier, and it increasingly occurred outside the regulated and protected banking system. Growth of new ways of lending outside of the normal banking system—often called the "shadow banking" system—is a common feature of bubble periods. Typically, financial institutions build new channels that get around the more established and better-regulated ones because it is initially advantageous to everyone involved. Fewer regulations make it cheaper to lend, borrowers get lower rates and easier terms, and investors get a small boost to returns. Often, shadow banks are able to make these new debt assets seem safe to investors via guarantees or through the way the assets are combined and packaged. Without having been through a crisis to stress-test them, it can be hard to tell if they really are as safe as they're made out to be. Often, these "innovations" lead to the crisis. That was true in this case.

In the early-to-mid-2000s, a number of new channels for increasing leverage popped up, and a number of existing less-regulated channels became larger. Many of these were short-term in nature and unregulated and thus were particularly vulnerable. During the bubble, there were five key components that helped fuel leveraging outside the traditional banking system:

NaN. Use of repo agreements and commercial paper. These developed into huge channels through which banks and corporations could borrow over short periods of time. Ben Bernanke notes that "repo liabilities of US broker dealers increased by a factor of 2.5 in the four years before the crisis."6

NaN. Large institutional depositors outside the protected banking system. Demand for Treasury securities, especially from foreign investors, outstripped supply, so there was a shortage of safe assets for investors. This led to demand for substitutes like asset-backed commercial paper and repo.

NaN. Development of money market funds, a short-term savings vehicle which promised higher returns than bank accounts without much additional risk.

NaN. Globalization of dollar lending, leading to the explosion of dollar borrowing and lending outside of US banks.

NaN. Securitization of lending, where banks take their traditional loans (auto loans, home loans, etc.) and sell them to other investors. This creates a "moral hazard" problem in which banks have an incentive to make risky loans since they can sell them and not bear the consequences (as long as investors remain willing to buy).

Asset-Backed Commercial Paper

The US financial regulatory system did not keep pace with these developments. It did not provide adequate regulatory visibility into the shadow banks and markets, nor did it provide the authorities with the powers they needed to curb their excesses, though, as is typical, that wasn't apparent at first. Banks and shadow banks at the time were inadequately capitalized and over-leveraged. This meant they didn't have much cushion and would be exposed to solvency problems in a downturn. In the 1990s and early 2000s era of financial liberalization and financial engineering, regulators were more concerned about the US financial industry staying competitive with London, which discouraged them from pulling in the reins.

If the debt boom had been financed largely by the banking system, it would have been dramatically easier to manage and the run easier to contain. It still would have been a bad crisis with a bad recession, but not as bad as this crisis

# Growing Financial Risks

Market returns are driven by how events transpire relative to what is discounted. At this time the markets are discounting the lowest risks in decades, yet we believe that the embedded risks in the system are quite large. We'll explain.

Right now the financial markets are awash with liquidity…It seems to us that money is now being thrown at financial instruments like it is being thrown at the art, jewelry and high-priced real-estate markets. Prices of risky assets, particularly those with positive carry, are being driven up, and yields/carries are being driven down, making expected future returns low. Simultaneously volatility has shrunk; as a result, low volatility is being assumed to continue and reaching for yields has caused increased leverage to be employed in order to try to squeeze more return out of the puny spreads/carry trades."

Investors Get a Break, but Some Lenders Absorb Blows

"The crisis in mortgage loans to people with weak, or subprime, credit intensified as a large lender, New Century Financial, stopped accepting loan applications because several of its financial backers cut off access to credit lines… Several dozen mortgage companies have gone out of business because of high default rates on mortgages written last year when lending standards were significantly more relaxed."

New York Times turned out to be. There would have been less forced selling and a less dangerous margin spiral, as the FDIC's systemic risk exemption powers to guarantee liabilities, combined with deposit insurance and the Fed's discount window, would have had more power and reach.

So it was not just low interest rates that fueled the bubble, but rather a combination of easy money, lax regulation, and risky financial innovations. As the Fed was looking at inflation and not debt growth when setting interest rates, and as policy makers allowed the lax regulation of shadow lending channels to continue, the bubble was allowed to grow.

Borrowers and lenders had severe asset/liability mismatches, which left them especially vulnerable in a downturn. This is a classic ingredient of a severe debt crisis. Most commonly these mismatches come in the following forms:

NaN. Borrowing short-term and lending long-term, leaving them to be squeezed when those who lent to them short-term don't want to lend to them anymore or only want to lend to them at interest rates much higher than what they are earning on the loans they have already made.

NaN. Lending to risky borrowers who will pay higher interest rates than they borrowed at in order to collect the credit spread—until the default rates pick up to a level greater than the credit spread.

NaN. Borrowing in one currency and lending/investing in another. When the currency they borrowed in rises, it forces borrowers to pay back the loan at a higher exchange rate or a higher interest rate than they can manage.

All these things happened during this bubble, which made these financial intermediaries and those who trusted them with their money very vulnerable to runs and credit problems.

One classic asset/liability mismatch that developed occurred via European banks actively borrowing dollars with short-term debt and then lending them to the world. When dollar credit tightened in the summer of 2007, these banks lost access to funding from the US money markets and became transmitters of contagion around the world.

Still, the economy continued to grow above potential. The GDP gap rose to 3 percent, while inflation rose to 3.7 percent. The Fed continued to tighten to bring the nominal short rate to 5.25 percent and the real short rate to 1.5 percent in 2007.

By 2007, I was sure that we were in a bubble because it had all the classic signs previously described, plus when we did cash flow projections for companies and financial institutions, we suspected that they would not be able to secure the amount of new lending they needed to allow them to roll over their debts that were coming due, while at the same time increasing their borrowing to sustain what they were doing. Without that new lending, there would be a debt crisis. We regularly reported our thinking and estimates to policy makers, giving them the choice of believing our numbers so that they could be better prepared, or correcting our numbers so that we could see where we were wrong. They typically took the research in without comment but with questions.

# The Top: 2007

# The First Half of 2007

Keep in mind that up until this time, hardly anyone was concerned about hardly anything because both the markets and the economy were doing great. Stocks were reaching new highs, the job market remained strong, retail sales were strong, and so was consumer sentiment.

However the housing market and its most aggressive financers began to show some cracks. As the SEC wrote in a memo on January 4, "[t]here is a broad recognition that, with the refinancing and real estate booms over, the business model of many of the smaller subprime originators is no longer viable."[7]

Markets were flatter between February and March, and overall market volatility was pretty low and priced to stay that way. Credit spreads, a measure of the perception of the risk of lending to private companies, were relatively low compared to historical norms. In other words, the market was tranquil and priced to stay that way.

Problems emanating out of subprime mortgage lenders—those that focused on mortgages for less credit-worthy borrowers—continued to grow, with some facing considerable losses, but they did not affect the broader economy and markets. Still, bigger banks were starting to report a rise in bad mortgage debts. We summarized the situation (in our March 13 Daily Observations) as follows:

# (BDO) March 13: Subprime Mortgage Fallout

Subprime mortgages have been grabbing the headlines, with several of the larger subprime mortgage lenders teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. The story of how the subprime mortgage sector is blowing up even with a relatively strong economy relates closely to the liquidity that is bubbling up in markets around the world. Over the last few years, investment banks have been hard at work creating fancy new products where they can package up a bunch of assets and sell the package for more than the sum of the parts (CDOs, CMOs, synthetic CDOs, etc.). They do this by tranching them up and getting the ratings agencies to rate the best slice AAA, the next slice AA, and so on. This financial "innovation" makes everyone happy: insurance companies get an AAA-rated bond that yields a few basis points more than their other AAA options, and so on down the line. Often hedge funds end up with the bottom piece, and that makes them happy because they get a lot of leverage/volatility. This innovation opens up a source of credit to many risky borrowers (not

-Associated Press just households) who previously would have had trouble accessing credit markets. The explosion in subprime mortgages is closely related to this new source of credit. Originators paid less and less attention to underwriting standards because they were just going to hand off the mortgages to the investment banks. The investment banks were eager to package them up and sell them to investors. The investors were getting 5bps more yield for the same credit rating. Lending standards slipped to absurdly low levels, and then a small up-tick in delinquencies caused the banks to refuse to buy the loans and the originators to be stuck with the losses.

…The thing that is really hammering the subprime lenders is "early payment defaults." The agreements with the investment banks who bought the subprime loans contained provisions that the lender would have to buy back the loans if the borrower missed one of the first few payments. Without fraud, it is very rare for a borrower to miss the first payment on a mortgage. In December, New Century, the second biggest subprime lender in 2006, disclosed that borrowers had failed to make the first payment on fully  $2.5\%$  of their loans. When the banks/investors demanded New Century buy back these loans, New Century couldn't come up with the cash. Several dozen smaller subprime lenders have gone bust this way in the last few months, although New Century is the biggest.

Most people thought that these troubles in one corner of the financial markets would not cause meaningful contagion elsewhere. On March 28, Chairman Bernanke said in Congressional testimony that "the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained." I had a similar assessment at the time, though I was more concerned about the extent of leverage and tightening going on in this bubble.

The US stock market continued to rally through April and May, hitting new records. The shaded portion of the chart shows the rally in the first half of the year.

In mid-June, 10-year Treasury yields hit 5.3 percent (the highest point since 2002), and in mid-July, the 90-day T-bill rate hit 5 percent, meaning the yield curve was very flat. That was the cyclical peak because of what came next.

As interest rates rise, so do debt service payments (both on new items bought on credit, as well as on previously acquired credit that was financed with variable rate debt). This discourages additional borrowing (as credit becomes more expensive) and reduces disposable income (as more money is spent on debt service). Because people borrow less and have less money left over to spend, spending slows, and since one person's spending is another person's income, incomes drop, and so on and so forth. When people spend less, prices go down, and economic activity decreases.

Simultaneously, as short-term interest rates rise and the yield curve flattens or inverts, liquidity declines, and the return on holding short duration assets (such as cash) increases as their yields rise. As these assets become relatively more attractive to hold in relation to longer duration financial assets (such as bonds, equities, and real estate), as well as those assets with lower grade credit ratings (as the spread to these assets declines), money moves out of financial assets, causing them to fall in value. Declining asset prices in turn create negative wealth effects, which feed back into the economy through declining spending and incomes.

The tightening popped the bubble. As interest rates rose, home prices began to decline, since debt service payments on new homes would be higher, and interest payments on many existing mortgages rose quickly because many subprime borrowers had taken out adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). As interest rates rose, so did their debt service payments. By June, these tightening pressures flowed through to the first broad sign of financial distress: rising foreclosures and delinquencies started to translate into meaningful losses for bigger banks. In mid-June, two hedge funds run out of the investment bank Bear Stearns that invested in subprime mortgage-backed securities (MBS)—one of them leveraged about 20:1^{9}—faced growing losses and a wave of investor redemptions. That required them to do a fire-sale of 3.6 billion of the securities, a large amount for the market.[10] The leveraged financial buying shifted into deleveraging selling. As the prices of securities they held fell, the hedge funds faced huge losses and forced liquidations. In the end, Bear Stearns promised a \$3.2 billion loan to bail out one of the funds (later reduced to \$1.6 billion), and other banks that seized collateral from the hedge funds cooperated to ensure that the market remained stable (e.g., not selling more subprime MBS). The funds would eventually be wiped out. These were relatively small funds, and the initial reverberations were limited.

July 16,2007 ABX Crash

"The market for subprime mortgage debt got significantly worse Monday helping to pace treasuries, and the price action suggests a player, larger than the Bear Stearns funds that blew up in June, is going bust. The Bear Stearns collapse in June hit the low rated tranches; last Friday and Monday the rout began in the higher rated tranches. The triple A rated tranches of subprime mortgage pools were in free-fall on Monday. For instance, the triple A tranches on 2007 mortgages covered by the ABX originally slated to pay a meager 9bps of spread are now trading at 440bps of spread."

# The Summer of 2007

Economic growth remained healthy and US equity markets hit new highs in mid-July. The most prominent question was whether the Fed's next move would be to tighten because of inflation concerns, or ease because of housing concerns.

Stress in the housing market was gradually building. The indices of subprime MBS (called the ABX indices) continued to see big price declines (even the AAA bonds, which were likely seen as "riskless" when purchased, fell around 5 percent), and some of the mortgage lenders started reporting increasing numbers of borrowers missing loan payments. One large mortgage lender looked to be closer to bankruptcy, and a small German bank exposed to mortgage loans faced big losses and ended up needing to be acquired by Germany's state bank. New home sales were falling very quickly. As this news emerged, the markets sold off a bit (ending July down 6 percent from the peak).

I expected this debt crisis to be self-reinforcing because of the impact that mark-to-market accounting and high leverage would have on lenders. Debt crises and downturns are self-reinforcing behaviors because as losses occur, both lenders and borrowers are less able to lend and borrow, which worsens conditions. For example, when losses occur, one's capital declines, and because there are limits to how much one can hold in assets relative to one's capital, that means assets have to be sold, or the buying of assets has to be curtailed. That in turn makes asset prices and lending weaker, producing more losses and reinforcing the cycle further. Because we could get very detailed financial information on banks that allowed us to know their exposures, we could estimate what the values and losses on their positions would be by knowing the pricing of analogous liquid assets. As a result, we constantly did our mark-to-market stress tests, which showed us that the financial sector and those dependent on it were incurring losses before they reported them. We could also get detailed financial information on public companies and our pro forma financial projections showed that many were facing debt squeezes.

Here is what I wrote to our clients and policy makers at the time.

# (BDO) July 26: Is This the Big One?

You know our view about the crazy lending and leveraging practices going on, creating a pervasive fragility in the financial system, leading us to believe that interest rates will rise until there is a cracking of the financial system, at which time everything will reverse (i.e. there will be a move to focusing on fear from focusing on greed, volatilities will increase, and carry and credit spreads will blow out). We had (and now have) no idea exactly when this will occur and if what's happening now is the big one. We just know that 1) we want to avoid or fade this lunacy and 2) no one knows how this financial market contagion will play out.

How it will play out is a function of who is carrying what positions and how these positions and players knock up against each other. A few months ago we undertook an extensive study to see which market players held what positions, especially via the derivatives markets. So we read all the studies by government overseers and financial intermediaries, we gathered and examined all the data we could obtain, and we delved into 10-K reports of financial intermediaries. And we concluded that no one has a clue. That is because one can only vaguely examine these exposures one level deep. In other words, while it is easy to see some parties' exposures (particularly those of regulated financial intermediaries), it is impossible to see who is carrying these and other positions in order to ascertain the net positions of the important parties. For example, the dealers who are at the epicenter of this know who their counterparties are, but they don't know their counterparties' total positions. But we do know that these exposures have grown rapidly (about four times as large as five years ago) and are huge (about 400 trillion).

At the time, growth still looked good as the debt and tightening conditions hadn't yet passed through to the economy. On July 31, we wrote: "Tuesday's slew of stats continued to convey a picture that the real economy was just fine heading into the recent market action," but we were extremely concerned that the Fed was too sanguine. In its August 7 monetary policy statement, the Fed said: "Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy."

In early August 2007, the mortgage market began to seriously unravel. On August 9, BNP Paribas, France's largest bank and one of the largest in the world by assets, froze 2.2 billion worth of investments in three of its funds because its holdings in US subprime mortgages had exposed it to big losses. Banks in Europe became more nervous about lending to each other, prompting the European Central Bank (ECB) to inject 95 billion euros into the banking system to get rates back to the ECB's target, and another 61 billion the next day. The US also saw a squeeze in safe Treasury bills and higher yields on riskier commercial paper and interbank lending rates. Money market funds, the main holders of asset-backed commercial paper, saw hits to their asset values and required assistance from their sponsors, banks, and fund families in order to avoid "breaking the buck." (By "breaking the buck" I mean falling in value below the amount deposited, which is something depositors assumed would never happen but did.)

The unraveling could be seen in interbank markets. The following chart shows a classic measure of interbank stress, the TED spread, in which a higher number means banks are demanding a higher interest rate to compensate for the risks of lending to each other. It was clear that the top in the debt cycle was being made.

Here is what I wrote to clients and policy makers the next day:

# (BDO) August 10: This Is the Big One

By that, we mean that this is the financial market unraveling that we've been expecting—the one in which there is an unwinding of widely held, irresponsibly created positions that occurred as a result of financial middlemen pressing to invest for high returns the immense amount of liquidity that has been flooding the financial system—i.e., another 1998 or 1994 (which occurred for the same reasons), just bigger. I want to reemphasize that what we know about this is less than what we don't know because how exactly the cards will fall will depend on who is holding what positions and how they all knock on with each other.

Despite us doing an awful lot of work to try to get this all mapped out over the last two years, we couldn't map this out to an extent that's worth much because our knowledge of these positions is so imprecise and the array of possible permutations is so wide that forecasting where we will be in a couple of weeks is a bit like predicting how a hurricane will run its course two weeks ahead. We are also highly confident that others, including the key regulators (who have the best windows in), can't give you a forecast that's much more reliable, so they are reacting to events. However, having seen this dynamic (i.e., a self-reinforcing panic move away from high risk investments to low risk investments in which badly positioned leveraged players get squeezed) many times before (1998 is the most recent case), we are pretty confident we know some things about how it will play out. This will run through the system with the speed of a hurricane (over the next four to six months), and it will leave weaker financial credits dead or damaged and stronger financial credits in the catbird seat…

…We have a game-plan (developed over many years) that we have confidence in because we planned for times like this, but for safety's sake, we are checking that all the hatches are battened down and that the expensive radar we've developed is working well. That game-plan doesn't just pertain to our investment strategy; it includes our strategy for handling counterparty risks and transactions costs in an environment of extreme risk-aversion and illiquidity.

What I was referring to as a game plan for this is what we called a "Depression gauge." Because big debt crises and depressions had happened many times before and we had the template explained in this study, we had created this gauge as a simple algorithm based on the proximity of interest rates to 0 percent, a few measures of debt vulnerability, and indications of the beginning of debt deleveraging that would lead us to change our overall portfolio and risk controls (including our counterparty risks).

Less than a week later, news emerged that Countrywide, the US's largest mortgage issuer, had exhausted its credit line, and was at risk of declaring bankruptcy. While notable because it was a canary in the coal mine, Countrywide was not a systemically important financial institution.

Over the next several days, stocks fell sharply and yields on commercial paper spiked. The Bank of Japan, the ECB, and the Fed all responded to the market stress by providing liquidity to banks. The worst of the stock sell-off ended when the Fed surprisingly cut interest rates by 0.5 percent—doing so between its regularly scheduled meetings—an unusual move. Chairman Bernanke said he would do more if needed.[11] And Bank of America shored up Countrywide by investing 2 billion in exchange for a large stake in the company. These moves alleviated most of the funding strains in the market, and equities recovered a bit. Below is a chart of the stock market up until that time. Note that it was still near its highs.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/da8467449375391ae6a5ecc9a9e101ce07012b9e5513e664b373425705a694d9.jpg)

Coming out of this episode, most policy makers and investors thought that the problems in the risky part of the mortgage market would be contained, so the flow-through to the real economy wouldn't be substantial. Based on our calculations, we saw it differently and wrote: "the day of reckoning will be pushed forward, probably to when there is a big tightening by the Fed or a big turdown in the economy."

# Why Banks and Investors Were So Exposed to Risky Mortgage Securities

Why were investors, banks, rating agencies and policy makers misled into thinking mortgage securities were less risky than they actually were? A key reason is the way risk is analyzed. Consider the conventional way investors think about risk. At the time, Value at Risk (VAR), which is a measure of recent volatility in markets and portfolios, was commonly used by investment firms and commercial banks to determine the likely magnitude and occurrence of losses. It typically uses recent volatility as the main input to how much risk (i.e., what size positions) one could comfortably take. As a simplifying illustration, imagine an investor that never wants to lose more than 20 percent. If the most that a subprime mortgage has ever lost in a month is 5 percent, then investors might plug that 5 percent number into a model that then says its "safe" for them to borrow until they own three times leveraged subprime.

This way of thinking about risk caused many investors to increase their exposures beyond what would normally be seen as prudent. They looked at the

The Bigger Problem

"In our opinion, what is happening here is bigger than what the world now commonly refers to as the 'credit crisis.' Normally, credit problems occur when borrowers get into a lot of debt and cash flows suffer, either because interest rates rise or the economy falls. But imagine a dynamic in which the credit keeps flowing and debts keep increasing. That is the dynamic that's happening. It is an extension of having too much credit/liquidity, not too little.

…The American household sector as a whole is now in pretty bad shape (i.e., has a bad balance sheet and poor cash flow outlook), so that pushing more money into its hands will lead to worse and worse financial problems pretty quickly, so we expect that there will be spreading of credit problems even though interest rates will decline and credit will be readily available. And we believe that this will continue until foreign investors increasingly realize that the US is not a good place to invest."

Fed Governor Warns Against Shielding

Investors From Their Losses

-Bloomberg recent volatility in their VAR calculations, and by and large expected it to continue moving forward. This is human nature and it was dumb because past volatility and past correlations aren't reliable forecasts of future risks.

But it was very profitable. In fact, when we were cutting back on our positions, our clients urged us to increase them because our VAR was low. We explained why we didn't do that. Extrapolating current conditions forward and imagining that they will be just a slightly different version of today is to us bad relative to considering the true range of possibilities going forward. If anything, I believe that one should bet on the opposite of what happened lately, because boring years tend to sow the seeds of future instability, as well as making the next downturn worse. That's because low volatility and benign VAR estimates encourage increased leverage. At the time, some leverage ratios were nearing 100:1. To me, leverage is a much better indicator of future volatility than VAR.

In 2007, many banks and investors were heavily exposed to subprime mortgages, since the instruments had not yet had a loss cycle or experienced much volatility. VAR was also self-reinforcing on the down side, because increased market volatility at the peak of the crisis in 2008 made their statistical riskiness look even higher, causing even more selling.

# The Fall of 2007

With stocks on the rebound after the bumpy summer, policy makers started to consider how they should approach the problems emanating from the mortgage market over the longer term.

Beginning in the fall of 2006, Paulson and the Treasury had begun working with Barney Frank and the House Financial Services Committee to reform Fannie and Freddie. They focused on curbing the excesses and increasing the authority of the regulator. A bill passed the House in the spring of 2007 but, stalled in the Senate. Due to significant political opposition, there was no possibility of getting Federal funding to modify mortgages for struggling homeowners. So the Bush Treasury worked with lenders, mortgage servicers, and counselors to motivate these private sector institutions to modify and restructure mortgages with some modest but meaningful success. Also, the Treasury began working with the Fed to jointly develop what they dubbed as the "break the glass" option to go to Congress and get the authority to purchase illiquid mortgage securities if and when this became politically feasible. This was the forerunner of what would become the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.

The Fed signaled its willingness to ease monetary policy to mitigate any spillover effects the mortgage-related stress might have on the broader economy. Although the data and news showed a steady deterioration in fundamentals, most market participants believed that policy makers would be able to make it through smoothly.

Bernanke began a push within the Fed (in close collaboration with Hank Paulson and the Treasury staff) toward what they dubbed "blue-sky thinking"—unrestricted brainstorming in anticipation of the possibility that conventional policy easing might not be enough.[12] As financial contagion spreads beyond the banking sector, increasing numbers of players in the real economy can no longer access credit through the usual channels. In what would become a crucial pillar of the Fed's response to the crisis, Bernanke considered the possibility of the Fed lending directly to a broader range of counterparties than just depository institutions. This would be a big, bold move, and so unprecedented that Bernanke had to check the rulebook to see if it was allowed. The provision of the Federal Reserve Act that authorized such lending—Section 13(3)—hadn't been invoked since the Great Depression, but it was still valid. Knowing which needed actions in a crisis are permitted (or not permitted) by law and how to have them approved is a classic challenge in democracies with rigid regulations and robust checks and balances systems.

Worsening circumstances led to expectations for a rate cut from the Fed. Still, there were reasons to ease and reasons not to ease. Two considerations especially weighed against easing. The first concerned inflation: the dollar had been steadily weakening and oil prices steadily rising. Easing would contribute to dollar weakness, higher oil prices, and higher inflation. The other consideration was that the problems all stemmed from wrongheaded speculation, and anything that the Fed did to ameliorate the problems of those speculators would only encourage them to take excessive risks again in the future.

This notion of "moral hazard" was one that the Fed (and Treasury) would have to wrestle with many times throughout the crisis. How the "moral hazard" question is dealt with during big debt crises is one of the biggest determinants of how these crises turn out. Because undisciplined lending and borrowing was the cause of crisis, it is natural to want to let those who were responsible experience the consequences of their actions, and to impose lots of discipline by tightening lending and borrowing. But that's like putting someone who just suffered a heart attack because they're too fat straight on a diet and a treadmill. At such times, above all else, the most important thing is to provide life-blood (i.e., stimulants) to keep the systemically important parts of the system alive. It is dangerous to try to be overly precise in getting the right balance between (a) letting those who borrowed and lent badly experience the consequences of their actions and (b) providing judicious amounts of liquidity/ lending to help rectify the severity of the contraction. It is far better to err on the side of providing too much than to provide too little. Unlike in the Great Depression, when the Fed allowed banks to fail en masse, the Fed took the view that although it would be good to minimize moral hazard when possible, its top priority had to be saving the economy.

Tim Geithner, who was the president of the New York Fed at the time, shared my thinking. He believed the moral hazard framework was the wrong way to think about policy during a financial crisis because policy needs to be very aggressive in taking out catastrophic risk, and one can't move slowly or precisely.[13] That has proven true time and time again. Providing plenty of liquidity during a liquidity crisis leaves the government open to less risk and leaves the system healthier. In contrast, the moral hazard framework leads people to believe that if you let things burn, the government will assume less risk. In reality, if you let everything burn, the government will end up taking on all of the risk, as it will have to nationalize the system in a much more costly and damaging way.

In the end, policy makers responded to the crisis by guaranteeing almost everything, explicitly or implicitly, and carrying out a dramatic, explicit injection of cash. Geithner told me that the interesting thing about this

Beware Moral Hazard Fundamentalists

"The term 'moral hazard' originally comes from the area of insurance. It refers to the prospect that insurance will distort behaviour, for example when holders of fire insurance take less precautions with respect to avoiding fire or when holders of health insurance use more healthcare than they would if they were not insured. In the financial arena the spectre of moral hazard is invoked to oppose policies that reduce the losses of financial institutions that have made bad decisions. In particular, it is used to caution against creating an expectation that there will be future 'bail-outs."

New Moves in Washington to Ease Mortgage Crisis

House Democrats squared off against the Bush administration today over measures to help homeowners trapped in a vise of unaffordable subprime mortgages and falling home prices.

The Democratic-controlled House passed a bill that would require the nation's two government-sponsored mortgage finance companies and the Federal Housing Administration's insurance program to channel up to 900 million a year into a new fund for affordable rental housing."

-New York Times approach was that instead of losing 5 to 10 percent of GDP on the cost of the financial rescue, we actually earned something like 2 percent of GDP, depending on how you measure it. That's a dramatic outlier in the history of financial crises, and Geithner credits it to the Fed and Treasury's very aggressive response and their willingness to put moral hazard concerns aside. I agree.

On September 18, 2007, the Fed cut rates by 0.5 percent, compared to the 0.25 percent expected by the market. As Bernanke put it, "the hawks and doves flocked together."[14] The Fed's bigger-than-expected move sparked a stock market rally that the New York Times described as "ecstatic," which brought the S&P 500 back to within 2 percent of its all-time high.

More important than the stimulation that would come from the Fed's interest rate cuts was the message this sent the markets—that the Fed was willing to take decisive action as needed to help contain the problems that had caused the market turmoil in August. At the same time, it was clear to those who ran the numbers that easing wouldn't solve the more fundamental problems of financial intermediaries, debtors, and creditors holding more debt assets and liabilities than could be serviced.

The banks' (and investment banks') balance sheet and liquidity problems were on both the asset side and the liability side. On the asset side, the problems stemmed from the banks' ownership of subprime mortgages through securitizations. On the liability side, the banks had become dependent on risky sources of funding. Banks had always relied on short-term funding, but historically this had consisted largely of deposits, which could be controlled with guarantees. Savers can always pull their deposits, and widespread fears about bank solvency had led them to do just that in the Great Depression. This led to the founding of the FDIC in 1933, which dealt with this problem by insuring bank deposits (up to a certain amount). That mostly eliminated the incentives the depositors had to flee, because even if a bank failed, their deposits would be protected.

But by relying on what was known as "short-term wholesale funding," modern banks had set themselves up for a similar situation to what banks had experienced between 1930 and 1933. Short-term wholesale funding took a variety of forms, but at its core, it was a lot like an uninsured deposit—meaning the depositor had a big incentive to pull it from the bank at the first sign of trouble.

Banks and investment banks had also gotten themselves into trouble by virtue of their central role in what we'll call the "securitization machine." At its heart, the securitization machine started with the issuance of risky mortgages and ended with the sale of very safe bonds to institutional investors. Lots of players were involved, but these financial intermediaries played a major role. Basically a mortgage lender would make the loans and sell them to a bank, which would package them up into a bundle of say 1,000 loans. The combined cash flows of these 1,000 loans were thought to be much safer than any individual loan because they benefited from diversification—if one borrower couldn't repay their mortgage, that might create a loss on one loan, but that wouldn't affect the ability of the other 999 borrowers to repay their loans. On average, most borrowers had historically been able to repay their mortgage loans, so the result of the packaging was (supposedly) to reduce the overall risk profile of the loans.

The bank would then slice up the total cash flows from the 1,000 loans and distribute them in chunks: 70 to 80 percent would become a super-safe AAA-rated bond, another 10 to 15 percent might become a slightly riskier but still pretty safe AA-rated bond, 5 to 10 percent would become a BBB-rated bond, and some small unrated residual (the "first-loss" piece) would take the losses of the first few borrowers that might default. This was a classic case of data-mining history rather than using sound logic to assess risk. People were leveraging themselves up by betting that they were safe, because the thing they were betting against had never happened before. When the bet went wrong, the self-reinforcing dynamic on the upside shifted to a self-reinforcing dynamic on the downside.

Banks would sell off whatever bonds they could to investors, typically retaining the first-loss piece in order to make the deal work. They carried bonds as inventory (sometimes with the intention of eventually selling them; other times to hold the exposure for return). This worked, which encouraged them to do it more until it didn't work. To varying degrees, the banks were holding large inventories of these bonds when demand dried up in the third quarter of 2007.

That happened when the write-downs due to mark-to-market accounting began. Bear Stearns saw its 3Q07 earnings drop by 61 percent due to losses related to the hedge funds that had blown up and other exposures it had to subprime mortgages. Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers took 7 percent and 3 percent hits to earnings, respectively (relatively small losses). Citigroup, UBS, and Merrill Lynch followed suit, reporting meaningful but manageable losses. Citigroup initially wrote down the largest loss, at 5.9 billion (keep that number in mind in comparison to the numbers later in our story).

Around this time (fall 2007) we started running our own loss estimates and "stress tests" of the financial system—gathering balance sheet data on banks to see their assets and liabilities, and applying liquid market prices as proxies to their illiquid holdings to estimate what they would have to report long before they would have to report it. This was invaluable in anticipating what was going to happen. On October 9, 2007, the S&P 500 closed at its all-time high. That high in stocks wouldn't be reached again until 2013.

It was clear to most people in the business that banks had a problem with subprime mortgages, though it wasn't yet clear to them that the whole economy had a major debt problem. To help alleviate the situation and build confidence, a number of major banks proposed joining forces and creating a fund that would aim to raise 75-100 billion for buying distressed subprime mortgage securities. Like other observers, we viewed it as a natural response to the credit crunch that would help to alleviate the risk of contagion. However, by the end of the year, efforts to establish this fund had been abandoned, as the collaborating banks decided that it was "not needed at this time."15

Meanwhile, despite optimism at home, the credit crunch spread from the US to Europe through two main mechanisms. The first was that some European banks (most notably the British bank Northern Rock) had come to rely on money markets for short-term wholesale funding. When that source of funding began to dry up in the summer of 2007, Northern Rock experienced a classic "run," with depositors lining up to withdraw funds for three straight days in the middle of September.[16] The UK had a similar deposit insurance scheme as

The second mechanism resulted from the investments that many European banks had made in subprime securitizations. The largest ones, like UBS and Deutsche Bank, owned stakes in securitizations as a corollary to their role in producing the securitizations themselves. Many smaller banks had simply wanted a piece of the action. After all, many slices of subprime securitizations had been rated AAA, meaning that rating agencies had stamped them as having extremely low risk. During previous periods of stress, such as the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, corporate bonds rated AAA had a default rate of 0 percent, according to Standard & Poor's, one of the big three rating agencies.[17] Plus, the subprime securitizations rated AAA offered a premium (though in hindsight, one that was far too small, given the level of risk) relative to corporate bonds of the same rating.

As our risk measures of the banks, investment banks, and broker dealers that we dealt with changed, we shifted our exposures from the riskier ones to safer ones, and also moved into safer assets.

In late October, 2007, sentiment began to turn for the worse as predictions of the overall losses on subprime securitizations started to increase. US stock prices suffered a steep 2.6 percent decline on October 19, after JPMorgan posted a 2 billion write-down and Bank of America announced much weaker-than-expected earnings.

It was becoming clear that losses on subprime mortgages were going to be a bigger problem than previously thought for the banks, but it wasn't yet clear just how severely the stress in the housing market was going to hit US households, whose consumption represents the bulk of US GDP (around 70 percent). Here's what we wrote about it at the time:

# (BDO) October 30: Falling Home Prices and Wealth

The weakening housing market affects the US economy in a number of ways ranging from falling construction, to falling expenditures on housing-related items, to less cash used from mortgage borrowing on non-housing-related consumption, to falling wealth. As we have described previously, the drop in financing alone (money borrowed against houses to spend on other things) made up over  $3\%$  at the peak and will likely be negative soon (and will have to be made up some other way if consumption growth is to remain where it is) while the decline in construction at a  $20\%$  annual pace is translating to about a  $1\%$  drag on real growth…Real estate assets as  $\%$  GDP peaked at  $167\%$ , so the drop in wealth will equal about  $50\%$  of GDP.

The impact on households was showing up in a variety of statistics: rising delinquencies on mortgages, slowing purchases of new and existing homes, slowing retail sales growth, etc. Policy makers understood that the situation was about to get worse: the roughly two million of those borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages we discussed earlier were scheduled to have their teaser rates expire in 2008, and thus were about to see their interest costs jump. Treasury Secretary Paulson announced various measures to help modify mortgages to extend teaser rates for stressed borrowers, but stopped short of putting taxpayer money behind the plan, limiting its potential impact.

Meanwhile, at Bridgewater, we completed our first look loss estimates and stress test by examining the balance sheet data of banks. For us, the exercise was so eye-opening that on November 21 we released what we called a "Special Report," excerpted here:

# Bridgewater Special Report:

What We Think Will Be Contained & What We Think Won't Be Contained

Some credit problems have surfaced and some haven't.

- We believe that the credit problems that have surfaced (i.e., the subprime/SIV problems) will spread (i.e., there will be a contagion) but they will be contained (i.e., won't spread beyond being manageable and won't sink the economy, though they will weaken it). That is because their size is manageable, their ownership is dispersed, and the demand to acquire these positions from buyers of distressed securities is relatively large because of the current environment of plentiful global liquidity. Management of this crisis will of course require wise decision-making and coordination of central banks, finance ministries, legislators and financial institutions in much the same way as management of past financial crises required these. We expect this wise management and coordinated decision-making, especially by central banks and finance ministries, because we have relatively high regard for the people involved and because the actions that are appropriate are relatively clear.
- We also "believe" that the credit problems that lie beneath the surface are much larger and more threatening than the ones that have surfaced. These latent credit problems are the result of a) there being an enormous amount of liquidity that is looking to be invested and b) investors increasingly and imprudently reaching for higher returns via structured, levered, illiquid, risky investments. Like subprime and other credit crunch problems before they surfaced, we and others (including government regulators) do not adequately understand these exposures, so it is difficult to say for sure where the problems lie or to know how they will behave individually and in interaction with each other in a stressful environment. What we do know is that these exposures have grown exponentially, are very large, and are based on many imprudent, sometimes seemingly nonsensical strategies. We also believe that if these problems surface, containing them will be challenging…

Big Bond Insurer discovers That Layers of Risk Do Not Create a Cushion

"On Thursday, shares of the nation's biggest insurer of financial risk, MBIA, fell 26 percent after it disclosed that it was guaranteeing billions of dollars of the kind of complex debt that unnerved the credit market this summer. The move came a day after Standard & Poor's downgraded another bond insurer and assigned a negative outlook to four companies, including MBIA."

New York Times

- Though we do not believe that the "below the surface problems" will come to the surface any time soon, we also want to make sure that we have no or minimal exposures to, and ample protections against, widening credit and liquidity spreads, declining equities, undoing carry trades, increasing volatility and deteriorating counterparties.
- When we include all of the credit crunch related exposures that exist for all entities, we think that the mark-to-market losses as of today are in the 420 billion range globally, which represents about 1\% of global GDP… we estimate their unrealized losses to be much larger than their realized losses so we expect much larger write-downs to come.

If we ran the numbers and were extremely concerned by both what we knew and what we didn't know. The biggest unknowns, even after we ran the numbers on potential bank losses (which were enormous), were how these losses might ripple through the market, especially via the derivative markets. Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is determined by the value of some underlying asset, rate, index, or even event. Unlike stocks or bonds, they are not used to raise money for spending or investment. Instead, they are primarily instruments for hedging risks and for speculating on changes in prices. They are made through private contracts rather than on exchanges and are unregulated. They were also enormous and opaque to everyone, so no one could get their heads around the exposures that existed—and nobody could really know how the bank and non-bank lender losses would cascade.

More specifically, in the three decades leading up to the crisis, a huge market in over-the-counter derivative contracts (i.e., those not traded on regulated exchanges) developed. In December 2000, Congress clarified that as long as these over-the-counter contracts (OTC) were between "sophisticated parties," they did not have to be regulated as futures or securities—effectively shielding OTC derivatives from virtually all oversight.[18] Over the next seven years, the OTC market grew quickly. By June 2008, the notional value of these contracts was 672.6 trillion.

A key derivative that would play a major role in the financial crisis was the credit default swap (CDS). A CDS plays a role that is similar to insurance. When an issuer sells a CDS, they promise to insure the buyer against potential defaults from a particular exposure (such as defaults creating losses from mortgage-backed securities) in exchange for a regular stream of payments. CDS's allow purchasers of mortgage-backed securities (and other assets) to transfer default risk to the party selling the CDS. AIG, for instance, sold lots of this "insurance," but only kept very small reserves against it—meaning they didn't have the capacity to pay out if there were large losses.

As noted earlier, I shared my concerns with the Treasury and White House, but they thought that the picture I was painting was implausible because nothing like that had happened in their lifetimes. While I am hesitant to speak about policy makers in general because there are so many differences in what they are like individually and the different seats they sit in (e.g., in the Treasury, White House, Congress, SEC, etc.), I must say that they are much more reactive than proactive, which is understandable because, unlike investors, they are not in the business of having to bet against the consensus and be right, and they operate within political systems that don't act until there is a broad consensus that there is an intolerable problem. As a result, policy makers generally don't act decisively until a crisis is on top of them.

As 2007 came to an end, the S&P 500 was down 6 percent from its October peak, but in positive territory for the year as a whole. December's biggest market sell-off came on a day that the Fed lowered interest rates by 0.25 percent—even though rate cuts ordinarily help stocks—since it was less than the 0.5 percent cut that the markets were expecting. Bond yields had declined more sharply, from yields around 5 percent back in June before the credit crunch began to around 4 percent at the end of the year. The dollar index was down 8.6 percent over the year. Oil, meanwhile, was up a whopping 55 percent to 96, just a hair beneath its all-time high.

# Depression: 2008

# January-February 2008

At the beginning of the year, cracks began to appear in the economy and the markets. US manufacturing, retail sales, and employment reports were relatively poor. Then came the inevitable announcements of big write downs (i.e., losses) at Citigroup ( \$22.2 billion) and Merrill Lynch (\$ 14.1 billion), as well as the downgrade of Ambac and MBIA, two bond insurers which had collectively guaranteed about 1 trillion worth of debt and had big exposure to subprime mortgage securities. These repeated losses were due to a combination of previous market declines in their holdings and accounting rules requiring them to be marked to the market and passed through their income statements and balance sheets. By January 20, the S&P 500 was down about 10 percent. Global equity markets were in even worse shape and fell even more, as shown in the chart below, left.

Witnessing all this, the Fed realized that it needed to act. Bernanke told the Federal Open Market Committee that although it wasn't the Fed's job to prevent sharp stock market declines, events seemed to "reflect a growing belief that the United States is in for a deep and protracted recession."[19] Emphasizing the need for immediate action, he said "we are facing, potentially, a broad crisis. We can no longer temporize. We have to address this…we have to try to get it under control. If we can't do that, then we are just going to lose control of the whole situation."[20]

Following an emergency meeting on January 22, the Fed cut rates by 75 basis points (i.e., 0.75 percent) to 3.5 percent, citing a "weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth." A week later, the Fed cut rates again, this time by 50 basis points, citing "considerable stress" in the financial sector, "a deepening of the contraction," and tight credit for "businesses and households." The combination of these cuts resulted in the largest calendar month decline in short rates since 1987. The Senate also passed a stimulus package (about 160 billion) to boost demand via tax rebates for low and middle income households.

Stocks bounced, but despite the magnitude of the easing, they failed to recoup their losses, and by the end of February, stocks were back to where they had been before the Fed intervened. Credit and economic conditions continued to deteriorate along the way. Massive write-downs were announced at AIG ( \$11 billion), UBS (\$ 14 billion), and Credit Suisse (\$2.8 billion), indicators of service sector growth and consumer confidence hit 7and 16-year lows, and a much publicized report from UBS estimated that losses from mortgage-backed securities could total \$600 billion in the US financial system.

Reflecting on events at the time, we thought it was important to remind our clients that this was not going to be a typical recession but rather a deleveraging/depression-type dynamic, which is quite different in terms of both its potential magnitude and the linkages that drive the contraction. In our Bridgewater Daily Observations on January 31, we wrote:

# (BDO)January 31: The Really Big Picture; Not Just a Normal Recession

The "R" word has been used a lot to describe the possible contraction in economic activity because all contractions are now called recessions. However, to use that term to describe what's happening would be misleading in that it connotes an economic contraction like those that occurred in the US many times before, as distinct from those that occurred in Japan in the 1990s and in the US in the 1930s, which are better characterized by the "D" word (e.g., deleveraging).

Contrary to popular belief, a "D" is not simply a more severe version of an "R"—it is an entirely different process…An "R" is a contraction in real GDP, brought on by a tight central bank policy (usually to fight inflation) that ends when the central bank eases. It is relatively well managed via interest rate changes…A "D" is an economic contraction that results from a financial deleveraging that leads assets (e.g., stocks and real estate) to be sold, causing asset prices to decline, causing equity levels to decline, causing more forced selling of assets, causing a contraction in credit and a contraction in economic activity, which worsens cash flows and increases asset sales in a self-reinforcing cycle. In other words, the financial deleveraging causes a financial crisis that causes an economic crisis.

# March 2008-Rescuing Bear Stearns

The first ten days of March saw equities sell off about 4.5 percent (with much larger losses for financials), following high profile defaults at Carlyle Capital (22 billion in assets under management or AUM), two funds operated by London-based Peloton Partners (3 billion AUM), and news that Thornburg Mortgage (36 billion in AUM) was missing margin calls. They were all heavily exposed to mortgage-backed securities and lenders were increasingly hesitant to lend them money.

These concerns quickly spread to major brokerages, especially those known to hold significant exposures to MBS, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, all of which saw their borrowing costs spike. The problems were passing to systemically important financial institutions, threatening the entire system. Even so, the danger was not widely appreciated. Writing on March 10, we noted in our *Bridgewater Daily Observations* that conditions were quickly "slipping away" and that "Broker/dealers in our experience cannot survive with financing costs close to Bear's current levels."

# Slipping Away

"As you know we have a vague fear that the degree of levered counterparty positions that have built up over the years creates a kind of house of financial cards. With financial markets making new lows, new problems are popping up.

More and more entities are failing on margin calls, and this is flowing through to the dealers who have the exposures when entities fail on margin. Financials were crushed Monday as rumors of liquidity trouble at Bear Stearns flew. While we don't have any view on rumors, the quantity of major entities failing on margin calls (TMA, Carlyle Financial) is likely creating trouble at many dealers. The counterparty exposures across dealers have grown so exponentially that it is difficult to imagine any one of them failing in isolation.

Bear Stearns has entered a non-equilibrium situation, as its business, in all likelihood, cannot be sustained at current market prices. Either things are going to get a lot better, or a lot worse for Bear. Broker/dealers in our experience cannot survive with financing costs close to Bear's current levels."

More Liquidity (Good), But No Accounting Change (Bad)

The Fed is doing its part. The Treasury, Congress and accounting regulators aren't doing their parts yet."

CDS Spread

Bear Stearns was the most stressed of the major investment banks. Although Bear was the smallest of them, it still held  \$400 billion worth of securities that would be dumped onto the market if it failed. Moreover, Bear and its nearly 400 subsidiaries had activities that touched almost every other major financial firm. It had 5,000 trading counterparties and 750,000 open derivatives contracts. As Bernanke put it in his memoirs,[21] "size alone wasn't the problem. Bear was big, but not that big compared to the largest commercial banks." It was not "too big to fail," it was "too interconnected to fail." Bernanke's greatest fear was that a Bear bankruptcy could trigger a collapse in the\$ 2.8 trillion tri-party repo market (a significant credit pipe for financial institutions), an event that would have "disastrous consequences for financial markets and, as credit froze and asset prices plunged, the entire economy."

Classically, when a financial institution starts to show early signs of stress, it can experience "runs" that can accelerate into a failure in a matter of days, because runs can lead to losing liquidity. That's because these institutions rely on short-term borrowing, often overnight borrowing, to hold longer-term, illiquid assets. At the first sight of trouble, it is logical for those who are providing this short-term credit to stop lending in order to avoid losses. We certainly didn't want to have exposure to a financial institution that was stressed. As more and more market participants change their behaviors in this way, it creates the liquidity crisis that leads to failure. That was what was happening to the financial institutions shown in the chart above to the degrees conveyed by the spreads. The Treasury and the Fed just had a few days to figure out their responses.

Big financial institutions have failed many times in the past. As I described in the prior sections of the book, if the debt is in one's own currency, and if policy makers have both the knowledge of what it takes to manage it and the authority to do so, then they are capable of handling these situations in a way that minimizes spill-over effects and limits economic pain (though some pain is inevitable). This is a theme we will return to time and time again.

In 2008, the US had a team of policy makers that understood what it would take to manage a debt crisis about as well as one could expect given that debt crises of this magnitude happen about once in a lifetime. I want to reemphasize how significant it was that the economic leadership team had the qualities they had. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson had more than thirty years of financial market experience at Goldman Sachs, including eight years as CEO, so he brought a good understanding of how financial institutions and markets worked and a forceful leadership style with experience in making tough decisions under pressure. Chairman Bernanke was one of the most prominent economists of the time, and one of the world's foremost experts on the Great Depression, which obviously provided critical perspective. Tim Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (which takes a leading role in overseeing the biggest banks and implementing monetary policy), had around two decades of experience in economic policy, including prominent roles at the Treasury and at the IMF, which gave him exposure to the handling of financial crises.

Geithner, Paulson, and Bernanke told me that they were extremely lucky to be on a team that trusted one another and had complementary skill sets, and they all believed that they needed to do whatever they could to prevent the failure of systemically important institutions. In other words, they agreed on the important things that had to be done and they were great at cooperating to do all in their power to get it done. I saw up close how lucky we all were, because without such cooperation and cleverness, we would have had such a terrible disaster that it would have taken decades to recover from it.

The biggest problem Geithner, Paulson, and Bernanke faced is that they didn't have all the legal authority they needed to make some of the moves that were necessary. For example, by law, the Treasury could only use funds for purposes designated by Congress. While handling a failing traditional bank (e.g., one that took retail deposits) had a clear playbook, primarily administered by the FDIC, there was no authority for the Treasury, the Fed, or any other regulator to provide capital to a failing investment bank. At this point, to save an investment bank, there would have to be a willing private sector buyer to take on the exposure. This limitation proved incredibly consequential.

The urgent need for flexible authority is a classic challenge for policy makers in the midst of crises. The system that is designed to ensure stability during normal times is often poorly suited to crisis scenarios in which immediate, aggressive action is required.

The Treasury and the Fed ran into this challenge with Bear Stearns, so the Fed turned to the plans it sketched out in late 2007, exercising its section 13(3) powers—which hadn't been used since the Great Depression—to arrest what Bernanke would later call "self-feeding [downward] liquidity dynamics."[22] It announced a 200 billion new program, the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), through which it would allow financial institutions, including major brokerage firms, to borrow cash or treasuries by using risky assets, including nongovernment mortgage-backed securities, as collateral. Markets applauded the injection of liquidity, with stocks posting their largest daily gain (about 4 percent) in over five years.

Despite the announcement of the TSLF, the run on Bear continued. In just four days (March 10-March 14) Bear Stearns saw an 18 billion cash buffer disappear as its customers quickly began withdrawing funds. Treasury Secretary Paulson feared the brokerage could collapse within 24 hours as soon he heard it was facing such a run on liquidity.[23] This was because Bear had been making loans of up to 60 days while remaining almost completely reliant on overnight funding. By Thursday, March 14, those fears were confirmed. Lenders in the repo market refused even to accept Treasury securities as collateral when making overnight loans to Bear Stearns.

We think that the Fed has done a fabulous job….

"We think the Fed is doing a great job. We wouldn't do anything different because doing anything different would produce intolerable results. Of course we have moral hazard concerns; we believe the Fed does too. But the line has to be drawn somewhere and we think that it is at that point that the equity of the financial intermediary is essentially gone and before the point that the credit problems pass to others—and that is taking it right to the edge (perhaps a bit too far).

While we believe the Fed is acting appropriately, that does not mean that we are confident that things will be all right. That's because the Fed can't do it alone (i.e., as you know, we think we need the accounting changes and they are for others to provide). Also, what probably will be required of the Fed boggles the mind.

The good thing is that the regulators now realize how serious the problems are. The question is whether they can move fast enough. As mentioned, an avalanche can be prevented, but it can't be reversed."

A Downturn as Data Revives Pessimism

"Wall Street pulled back on Wednesday after a drop in durable goods orders for February injected more pessimism about the economy into the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 110 points…Investors were disappointed to see a 1.7 percent dip last month in orders for durable goods, which are costly items like refrigerators, cars and computers. The drop followed a decline of 5.3 percent in January."

-Associated Press

Bernanke, Geithner, and other Fed officials agreed that another loan from the Fed wasn't going to help Bear Stearns. It needed more equity—an investor to fill the hole created by all the losses. At this point, the Treasury didn't have the authority to be that investor. A private sector solution—a healthier institution to acquire Bear—was the best option. To buy time, the Fed, along with JP Morgan, promised on March 13 to extend Bear Stearns "secured funding…as necessary, for an initial period of 28 days."

JPMorgan, the third largest bank holding company in the country at the time, was the most natural candidate to buy Bear, because it was Bear's clearing bank, served as an intermediary between Bear and its repo lenders, and was thus considerably more familiar with Bear's holdings than any other potential suitor. Only JPMorgan could credibly review Bear's assets and make a bid before Asian markets opened on Sunday, a process which importantly included guaranteeing Bear's trading book. However, JPMorgan was not willing to proceed if it meant having to take over Bear's  \$35 billion mortgage portfolio. To push a deal through, the Fed promised to provide JPM with a\$ 30 billion non-recourse loan to buy out the brokerage (at \$2 a share—its peak was \$173), secured by Bear's mortgage pool, meaning that future losses on the mortgage portfolio would be borne by the Fed—and ultimately the taxpayer. They also created a new lending facility where twenty investment banks/brokerages could borrow unlimited sums while posting MBS for collateral.

On Tuesday, the Fed additionally cut rates 75 basis points (bringing the policy rate down to 2.25 percent). The rescue and aggressive injection of liquidity had the desired effect. Stocks rallied and remarkably ended the month flat. Using taxpayer money to save Bear Stearns would prove a controversial decision, but as we noted in our Daily Observations at the time, failure to do so would have resulted in the "financial system…passing the point of no return (i.e., the point at which the blowing out of risk and liquidity premiums would be self-reinforcing)."

Although the markets rebounded, Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner worried because they saw that, without a buyer, they didn't have the authority to prevent the bankruptcy of an investment bank in the midst of a panic, and they immediately began to worry about Lehman.[24]

Paulson and Bernanke met with House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank and told him that they were concerned about Lehman and needed emergency authority to wind down a failing investment bank in the midst of a panic. Frank told them that this would be impossible to get from Congress unless they made a compelling public case that Lehman was about to fail and that its failure would damage the US economy. Paulson and Geithner maintained frequent communication with Lehman's CEO in an unsuccessful attempt to convince him to sell the bank or raise equity from a strategic, cornerstone investor.[25]

Later in April, Paulson used the Bear failure to convene a meeting with Senators Chris Dodd and Richard Shelby (the current and former chairmen of the Senate Banking Committee) and Daniel Mudd and Richard Syron (the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).26 This led to the Senate taking up the GSE reform legislation, which had passed the House in May of 2007 but had stalled in the Senate.

# The Post-Rescue Rally: April-May 2008

In response to the rescue of Bear Stearns and the big easing, stocks rallied and bond yields rose through most of April and May, as markets became increasingly confident that the Fed would do whatever was necessary if things got bad enough. Prominent policy makers struck a tone of cautious optimism, with Treasury Secretary Paulson noting that the economy was beginning to rebound and that he also "expected to see a faster pace of economic growth before the end of the year."[27] The charts below are some of the key markets at the time. You might give some thought to what bets you would've made then.

The "expansions of balance sheets" (i.e., the increased lending and buying of assets) through borrowing was beginning to slow, and, as a result, economic conditions continued to weaken as reflected in the economic stats, which came in below expectations. Unemployment continued to climb, consumer confidence and borrowing continued to fall, housing delinquencies and foreclosures continued to rise, and manufacturing and services activity continued to contract. Simultaneously, fresh rounds of write-downs were announced at UBS ( \$19 billion), Deutsche Bank (\$ 4 billion), MBIA (\$2.4 billion), and AIG (\$7.8 billion). Reflecting on the market action in the months following the Fed's rescue, we likened it to a "currency intervention that temporarily reverses the markets but doesn't change the underlying conditions that necessitated the action."

"The market…tumbled in early afternoon after reports that Lehman Brothers planned to raise 4 billion in capital became a rumor that the investment bank had approached the Federal Reserve to borrow money."

-Associated Press

Simultaneously oil prices continued to climb (hitting 130 in late May) and the dollar continued to fall. These moves added to the Fed's dilemma, as it would have to balance keeping its policy accommodative to ward off an economic contraction and a further deterioration in financial conditions with concerns over price stability. The minutes of the Fed's April meeting reflected this, with the committee acknowledging "the difficulty of gauging the appropriate stance of policy in current circumstances." Two members even expressed "substantial concerns about the prospects for inflation" and warned that "another reduction in the funds rate…could prove costly over the long run."

It should be noted that using interest rate and liquidity management policies that affect the whole economy to deal with the debt problems of certain sectors is very inefficient at best. Macroprudential policies are more appropriate (and in fact would've been appropriate much earlier, such as in 2007 when they could've been used to control the then-emerging bubbles). They were not to be put to use until much later, when pressing circumstances required their use.

Collectively, the combination of new-found optimism in the financial system and growing concerns over price stability meant that when the Fed cut rates in late April, markets priced it as the end of the easing cycle.

# Summer of 2008: Stagflation

In June the S&P fell by 9 percent because surging oil prices led to a spike in inflation at the same time that there were renewed credit problems in the financial sector and poor economic stats.

In terms of credit problems, the month began with downgrades of Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley by Standard & Poor's, with the rating agency noting that it had lost some confidence in these banks' ability to meet their financial obligations. This was followed by rumors that Lehman had approached the Fed for emergency funding and a release from Moody's that MBIA and Ambac (two of the country's largest bond insurers) were likely to lose their AAA ratings (thereby severely impairing their ability to write new insurance). By the end of the month, Moody's had cut the insurers' ratings and placed Lehman on credit review, while home foreclosures and mortgage delinquency rates, the underlying drivers of the strains, continued to accelerate.

As we looked at these institutions' balance sheets, estimated the losses they would have to report, and imagined what the reduced capital from those losses would mean for their lending and sales of assets, it was clear to us that they were headed for serious trouble that would have serious knock-on effects. Basically, they were getting margin calls, which meant that they would have to raise capital or sell assets and contract their lending, which would be bad for the markets and the economy.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/78bafe4369f8ede9cbc93b98af8209993ab8c52bc8bef04f362ec1b6d460f20c.jpg)

As a result of the contraction in credit, unemployment surged to 5.6 percent (the largest monthly increase in two decades), manufacturing activity declined for the fourth month in a row, and consumer confidence hit a 16-year low. Simultaneously, a CPI print showed that headline inflation rose to 4.4 percent in May, its sharpest increase in six months, and spiked fears of stagflation amidst poor growth and rising inflation expectations.

To ease or not to ease—that was the question. The cross-currents made the answer less than obvious. Throughout the month, policy makers repeatedly alluded to concerns for both economic growth and price stability. Bernanke called rising oil prices unwelcome, and Paulson emphasized that they would be "a real headwind" for the economy. With respect to the exchange rate, Bernanke emphasized that the Fed would "carefully monitor" its implications for inflation and inflation expectations, while Paulson even suggested that he "would never take intervention off the table."[28]

The pickup in inflationary pressures prompted a shift of the Fed's priorities from preventing debt and economic risks to growth and toward assuring price stability. As early as June 4, Bernanke noted that further interest-rate cuts were unlikely due to concerns over inflation, and suggested that the current policy rate was sufficient to promote moderate growth.[29] A few days later Bernanke gave a speech noting that the rising commodity prices and the dollar's depressed value posed a challenge for anchoring long-term inflation. Finally, on June 25, the Fed left rates unchanged, noting that "although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased." Ugh. See the charts below.

Markets continued to decline, oil prices rose, and a series of ratings downgrades, write-downs, and poor housing stats surfaced during the first two weeks of July. Financial stocks went into a free fall as it became clear that the Fed was behind developments and that the credit problems would not be fixed up via a blanket easy Fed policy even if it aggressively eased. The mortgage crisis and who it would affect next also became clearer. Shares of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae came under extreme selling pressure, following a report by Lehman Brothers, published on July 7, stating that the two mortgage giants would need a capital infusion of as much as 75 billion to remain solvent. According to Paulson, the report "set off an investor stampede," with shares of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae declining by about 45 percent each respectively in the week following the report's release.[30]

In mid-July, markets bounced because oil prices declined sharply (leaving more room for the Fed to ease) and policy makers made a series of interventions to shore up confidence in the financial sector—most importantly with respect to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Also, the SEC placed restrictions on shorting 19 financial stocks (including the two mortgage lenders), the Fed extended its emergency lending program for investment banks and brokerages, and the Treasury and the Fed announced a plan under which Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae would be able to tap into public funding (i.e., be bailed out) if on the verge of collapse.

# Taking Control of Fannie and Freddie

Of all the interventions, the guarantee to use public funds to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was the most unprecedented. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), created by Congress in 1938 and 1970 respectively, with the former being part of Roosevelt's New Deal following the Great Depression. They were created to stabilize the US mortgage market and promote affordable housing. They did this primarily by buying mortgages from approved private lenders, packaging many together, guaranteeing timely payment on them, and then selling them back to investors.

At first glance, everyone looked to benefit from this arrangement. Private lenders had a ready buyer for about as many mortgages as they could originate. Fannie and Freddie profited greatly from buying riskier mortgages and turning them into a safe asset (i.e., buying something cheap and selling it for more). Banks and other investors were happy to have a greater supply of safe assets to invest in, earning slightly more than they would on equivalent treasury bonds. And households benefited from cheaper borrowing rates.

Of course, all this was based on an implicit guarantee that the government would backstop Fannie and Freddie—it was only that guarantee that allowed the securities issued by GSEs to be seen as about as safe as treasuries, giving them very low borrowing rates. At times, the spread on their debt to treasuries essentially hit 0 percent.

# News & Bridgewater Daily Observations (BDO)

June 30, 2008 Markets are tightening while the economy is deteriorating and financials are in free-fall "In the past three months since the Bear Stearns rescue a set of economic and market conditions have transpired that are inherently unsustainable and self-defeating. While the tax refunds and a few other unsustainable sources of money have stabilized spending and the economy, market prices that directly impact the economy have responded in a way that is uniformly restrictive. At the same time, the bounce in financial stocks that originally conveyed a more positive tone to the financial landscape has largely disappeared. Instead, deteriorating credit conditions in the real economy are feeding back onto the financial system, leaving behind a very big pile of financial institutions whose stock prices are in free-fall and whose market value of leverage is exploding. This high market value of leverage (assets divided by market cap) implies that on the margin, ever smaller declines in the value of their assets will wipe out ever larger chunks of equity value, the classic over-leveraged death spiral. Bigger losses lie ahead and the banking industry does not have enough healthy entities to absorb the dying ones. And, the sovereign wealth funds have lost their appetite for large doses of bank equity. The inadequacy of bank capital combined with the coming need to liquidate ever-larger portfolios of bank assets will further constrain credit growth in the economy. In the meantime, market prices are acting as a restrictive force against growth at the same time that the financial sector is collapsing."

All Markets are Trading as One…

"All markets are trading as one, with a recent turning point of July 15. The turning point was marked by a 17 drop in oil prices, limits on shorting financials when short interest was at a record, and a few positive earnings surprises from the banks. Of course this action can't last because the forces that drive these markets are widely varied and often conflicting, but such action is common when sentiment gets to extremes… Meanwhile, there has been no reversal in the underlying economic conditions as reflected in the economic stats through July. They have continued to weaken."

While they weren't officially guaranteed by law, and government officials had denied for years that there was any guarantee, the private market believed that the government would never let the GSEs fail, as it would hurt too many, including individual homeowners—though they couldn't be 100 percent sure because the Treasury wouldn't make that assurance. I remember a dinner meeting I had with the head of a Chinese organization that held a massive amount of bonds issued by the GSEs, in which she expressed her concerns. I especially admired how the Chinese creditors approached this situation analytically and with a high level of consideration. Ironically the larger the GSEs grew, the more "systemically important" they became, which in turn all but guaranteed a government rescue if needed, making them safer and further fueling their growth.

Although Fannie and Freddie were supposed to generate revenue primarily through insuring mortgage debt, by 2007 about two-thirds of their profits came from holding risky mortgage-backed securities. The problems associated with having these exposures were made worse by lax regulation. Congress only required Freddie and Fannie to keep 0.45 percent of their off-balance-sheet obligations and 2.5 percent of their portfolio assets in reserves, meaning that they were significantly undercapitalized, even when compared with commercial banks of equivalent size, which were also severely undercapitalized (meaning that it only took a modest loss to make them go broke). Paulson saw this and openly called them "disasters waiting to happen…extreme examples of a broader problem…too much leverage and lax regulation."[31]

By 2007, these two mortgage insurers were twenty times larger than Bear Stearns and either owned, or had guaranteed, \$5 trillion dollars in residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities—about half of what had been issued in the US. Financing such operations also made them one of the largest issuers of debt in the world, with \$1.7 trillion outstanding, about 20 percent of which was held by international investors. They were also huge players in the short-term lending market, frequently borrowing up to 20 billion a week. It didn't take a sharp pencil to see that they were a disaster waiting to happen. The only question was what the government would do.

Doing something to rein them in would be politically challenging. Larry Summers recently described to me the challenges he faced when dealing with them in the 1990s:

"Fannie and Freddie had vast political power. When we said anything raising any concern about them, they had arranged for the Treasury to receive 40,000 pieces of mail saying it is important that Fannie and Freddie be fully enabled to do their vital work. When we testified on Fannie and Freddie, a congressman would pull out an envelope from Fannie with their prepared statements and what their questions were going to be. They would have a set of mayors call if you tried to mess with them. The most disillusioning experience I had with respect to the financial community was at the quarterly dinner for the Treasury Advisory Borrowing Committee. I asked them: 'What do you guys think about the GSEs?' They said that the GSEs were like a massively over-leveraged hedge fund—dangerous. They were pretty emphatic. I said, 'Would you put that in your report?' and they said they would. The report came back basically saying that Fannie and Freddie are vital contributors to our financial systems. I asked what happened. They said that they checked with their bosses and their bosses said we couldn't say that because we all had such important client relationships."

Paulson described this situation as follows:

"We had seen what happened in March when Bear Stearns's counterparties… abruptly turned away. We had survived that, but the collapse of Fannie and Freddie would be catastrophic. Seemingly everyone in the world—little banks, big banks, foreign central banks, money market funds—[either] owned their paper or were [their] counterparty. Investors would lose tens of billions; foreigners would lose confidence in the US. It might cause a run on the dollar."32

This case exemplifies the very common problem of politics creating government guarantees (implicit or explicit) that make risky assets appear to be safer than they are. This encourages investors to lever up in them, which feeds bad debt growth.

As losses from mortgage-backed securities mounted, shares of Freddie and Fannie plummeted because everyone knew they had a lot of bad debt. Equity holders knew they would get hit even if the creditors were protected. By July 15, Freddie and Fannie's equity prices had declined by almost 75 percent in less than a year.

Now that the crisis was at hand and undeniably obvious, it had to be dealt with. After frantic behind the scenes negotiations, the Treasury was able to get a bill passed by Congress on July 23 allowing it to use a virtually unlimited (Paulson chose the term "unspecified") amount of dollars to provide funds to the two GSEs (limited only by the overall federal debt ceiling), and expanded regulatory oversight of them. The Treasury basically acquired a blank check, backstopped by the taxpayer, to do whatever it took to keep these institutions solvent.

Nationalizing too-big-to-fail financial institutions on the brink of failure is a classic move in a deleveraging that is usually well received, as it signifies that the government is willing to provide a blanket of safety over the system. Remember that when debts are denominated in a country's own currency, the government has the power to eliminate the risks of default.

Given the continued strains on financial entities, new financial institution failures are likely. Market expectations are currently pricing roughly 4\% of financial institutions going bankrupt in the next 6 months, implying an asset liquidation of 600 bn…The banking sector as a whole has only about half of that amount of free equity capital available today, much of which will need to be available to absorb credit losses on old loans."

After 43 Billion in Write-Downs, UBS to Split Main Businesses

-New York Times

Though there are undeniable advantages to a political environment in which there are checks and balances and laws, during times of crisis there exists the risk that what needs to be done might not be done swiftly enough. That's because laws are never written so perfectly that they can anticipate and specify how to handle every possible circumstance. Throughout the 2008 financial crisis, there were numerous close calls in which the parties involved did the things that needed to be done, even if that required them to get around the rules to do them.

On July 30, as soon as Congress granted the Treasury the authority to oversee Fannie and Freddie, regulators from the Treasury began working to assess just how dire the situation was. With the help of the Fed and outside accounting specialists, Treasury officials pored over the GSEs' books. They soon discovered that both Fannie and Freddie had been papering over massive capital losses. Once they had properly accounted for questionably valued intangible assets and improperly valued mortgage guarantees, they saw that both companies were at least tens of billions of dollars underwater. As Paulson later put it, "We'd been prepared for bad news, but the extent of the problems was startling."[33]

From mid-August until the bailout, the situation was analyzed; terms were finalized on September 7. The Treasury then raced to build a plan that would serve its economic goals without bumping up against legal constraints. In the end, it decided to put the GSEs into conservatorship while injecting capital through guaranteed purchases of preferred stock. Conservatorship would allow both Fannie and Freddie to keep running relatively normally following the takeover, while the guaranteed stock purchases would allow the Treasury to effectively backstop their debt, even after the 18-month limit on its authority expired. And, importantly, Paulson wouldn't have to give Fannie and Freddie any heads up—all it would take was a go-ahead from their direct regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).

Bailing out the GSEs was more of a political challenge than an economic one. The executives of both companies still believed they were on sound footing. After all, just a couple of weeks before the FHFA had sent the GSEs drafts of reports concluding they were sufficiently capitalized. If news of the planned takeover leaked, the executives of Fannie and Freddie would have time to mobilize their lobbyists and congressional allies in Washington to fight it. And if there were a fight, there was no guarantee that the Treasury would win—in Paulson's words, the GSEs were famously the "toughest streetfighters in town."34

Convincing the FHFA examiners required the coordination and combined influence of the Treasury, the Fed, the OCC, and the FDIC. The FHFA, which had repeatedly blessed Fannie and Freddie's books on the basis of loose statutory accounting rules, was embarrassed at the thought of reversing itself so suddenly. But after weeks of pressure from the Treasury and its allies, the FHFA examiners gave in on September 4. The next day, the news was given to the boards of the two companies. Fearing that any friction or delay in the takeover might send markets plunging, Paulson set out, in his own words, "to ambush Freddie and Fannie" with no advance warning.[35]

Paulson described the Fannie-Freddie situation to me as follows. In July 2008, when Fannie and Freddie were beginning to fail, the Treasury asked for very expansive emergency powers. As Freddie and Fannie combined were nine times larger than Lehman Brothers and the dominant sources of mortgage financing during the crisis, they could not be allowed to fail. However, Paulson's political people had told him that if they put a big dollar number in front of Congress for approval, Congress would likely get spooked. As Paulson couldn't ask for unlimited authority to inject capital into the two GSEs, he decided to ask for "unspecified" authority.

However, when the Treasury finally got the "unspecified" authority, it was temporary, i.e., it expired in October 2009. This presented a challenge, because Fannie and Freddie had long-term debt and insured long term mortgages. So it took some creative financial engineering to turn this expansive authority, which Congress had intended to be only temporary, into what was for all intents and purposes a long-term guarantee. To do this, policy makers used their ability to immediately issue long-term preferred stock. Then they used these preferred shares to backstop Fannie and Freddie and absorb any potential losses.

This particular move—with its legal finagling—and the need to convince numerous lawmakers to set aside their ideological opposition to bailouts for financial institutions, while at the same time getting Congress to raise the debt ceiling sufficiently to allow for a potentially meaningful capital injection, were unprecedented and remarkable. But as Paulson described it later, "if Congress failed to come through, markets would imploge. The stakes were enormous."36

In early August, falling oil prices and the Treasury's unprecedented intervention helped usher in an interval of relief, with equities rallying modestly through August (about 2 percent), financials down only 1 percent, and the free fall of Freddie and Fannie stock halted. However, despite the growing perception that financial markets were stabilizing, the underlying drivers of credit problems, and their feedback mechanisms into the real economy, had not changed.

On August 18, I reminded the readers of our Daily Observations that the worst was yet to come.

# (BDO) August 18: Entering the Second Stage of the Deleveraging

It seems to me that we have been through much of the first stage and are now entering the second stage (i.e., the avalanche stage) of the deleveraging. While the Fed did a great job of providing liquidity where it reasonably could, the accounting adjustments (e.g., allowing losses to be written down over several years) weren't made, so we are approaching a solvency crisis that we think is about to result in an avalanche of asset sales. So now the question is whether they will create a safety net in time to catch these assets so that they don't crash and bring down the financial system and the economy with it. Frankly, we think that this will be a race to the wire.

# The Crash: September 2008

In September the crisis entered a new stage in which there was a genuine risk that the world economy would plunge into a depression. Since so much happened, I will transition into a nearly day-by-day account of events. I will convey it via both my narrative and the newsfeed on the sides of the page.

Over the first week of September, there was a mix of good and bad news in the form of oil prices falling precipitously (which reduced concern over inflation and provided a tailwind to US consumer spending). Airlines and retailers, hopeful of a pickup in consumer spending, were particular beneficiaries. At the same time, falling oil prices reflected weakening global growth.

While financial players like Lehman Brothers, Freddie, Fannie, and Ambac were struggling, it also seemed as though solutions to their problems were in the works. For example, Lehman's stock rose on news that it had made progress in negotiations to sell part of itself to the Korea Development Bank, while good news from Freddie (a successful sale of 4 billion in debt) and Ambac (the announced launch of a new insurance subsidiary) partially softened investor concerns surrounding these companies.

These positive developments were set against a continuous trickle of negative stat releases—in particular, an unanticipated spike in jobless claims and a notable uptick in the unemployment rate (from 5.7 percent to 6.1 percent). Stocks declined by 2.5 percent. Weak economic reports also filtered in from outside the US. From Canada to Australia, the story was the same—slowing demand, slowing output, and no end in sight. All in all, stocks ended the first week of September just slightly down.

The big news came after markets closed at the end of the week, when reports broke that the federal government would take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

# Lehman Goes Bankrupt: September 8-15

Stocks rose about two percent on Monday, September 8, as the market responded positively to news of the nationalization of Fannie and Freddie, a bold move that would have been unthinkable months before. The New York Times wrote that "financial stocks led the surge, propelled by hope that the government's decision had averted a calamity and marked a possible turning point in the credit crisis that has troubled banks for nearly a year" (my emphasis). Boy, was that wrong.

Writers of accounts such as this one, who have the benefit of hindsight, typically paint pictures of what happened in ways that make what happened seem obvious. However, as that rally and comment reflect, it is an entirely different matter when one is in the moment. Just days before the crisis would become much worse, the New York Times wrote on three separate occasions (September 3, 5, and 10) about "bargain hunters" coming in with the stock market down around 20 percent from peak and many individual stocks down much more. Lehman Brothers, for instance, was trading down some 80 percent, but it was a company with a good reputation, a nearly 160-year history, and it looked to be on the verge of finding a buyer or strategic investor. Below is its share price through early September. While the picture is clearly within the downtrend, there were rallies, and in just about all of them, one could make the argument that the bottom was being made. In investing, it's at least as important to know when not to be confident and when not to make a bet as it is to have an opinion and make one.

The strategic investor who would come in and save Lehman never materialized and Lehman's stock fell by almost 50 percent on Tuesday. Other major bank stocks, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill, sold off 5-10 percent, while the overall market was down about 3 percent, and credit spreads widened substantially. Both investors and regulators began to wonder whether Lehman could survive until the weekend.

CDS Spread

There were no clear, legally acceptable paths for saving failing investment banks, yet these investment banks were "systemically important" (i.e., they could easily take the whole system down with them). While the Fed was able to lend to Lehman to alleviate its liquidity problem, there were limitations on how much they should under these conditions. And since Lehman faced a solvency problem in addition to a liquidity problem, it wasn't even clear that more liquidity could save it.

As we described earlier, a solvency problem can only be dealt with by providing more equity capital (or changing the accounting/regulatory rules). This meant that some entity needed to invest in it or acquire it. Neither the Fed nor the Treasury had the authority to provide that. Hence, there was a need to find a private sector investor/buyer, like Bear Stearns had with JPMorgan. But finding an investor for Lehman was harder than it was for Bear. Lehman was bigger, with a bigger, more complicated, and murkier mess of losing positions.

Finding a buyer was made even harder by the fact that Lehman wasn't the only investment bank needing a buyer to survive. Merrill Lynch, another iconic Wall Street investment bank, was in a similarly dire situation. As with Lehman, many believed that without an investor Merrill was no more than a week away from bankruptcy.[37]

On Thursday Lehman's shares continued their free fall, declining another 42 percent as rumors swirled that Barclays and Bank of America, though interested, were unwilling to buy without government assistance. At this point, Lehman was continually rolling 200 billion in overnight loans just to stay running, putting it at huge risk of a pullback in credit.[38]

On Friday Lehman's shares dropped 17 percent on news that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would backstop any deal. Lehman's failure would pass through the system quickly, causing a domino effect that took a toll on AIG (its stock fell 31 percent). But, remarkably, most of the market still believed that the financial sector's problems would be contained. The overall market closed on Friday up 0.4 percent, aided by falling oil prices.

On Friday evening, reports surfaced that Fed officials had gathered the heads of Wall Street's major banks—from Goldman Sachs to the Bank of New York Mellon—to urge them to bail out Lehman. Whether there would be any takers remained to be seen. Bank of America, Barclays, and HSBC had reportedly expressed interest, but none wanted to do the deal without government support. And Treasury officials publicly insisted no support would come.

Paulson had hoped that by motivating a consortium of financial institutions to take on Lehman's bad loans, a potential acquisition of Lehman could be facilitated (as a potential buyer could leave a substantial portion of Lehman's bad assets behind when they acquired the firm). But while some progress was made with the consortium, no potential buyer emerged. Without a potential buyer, the Fed did not have any authorities which would have been effective in preventing the failure of a nonbank in the midst of a panic-driven run, according to Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner.[39]

Bernanke and Geithner had many conversations together and with Paulson about what they could do to help prevent Lehman's failure, but, as in the case of Bear Stearns, they did not believe that a Fed loan would be effective. They believed that the legal requirement that a loan had to be "secured to their satisfaction" limited the amount they could lend, and that meant they could not lend Lehman enough to save it or guarantee its trading book. The weeks before that fateful weekend were consumed by the effort to figure out a way to prevent Lehman's failure despite those constraints. They were willing to be very creative with their authority and to take a lot of risk, but only within the bounds of what the law allowed. They erred on the side of doing more, not less, but Section 13(3) (the section of the Federal Reserve Act that allowed for emergency lending to a wider set of borrowers) did not make them alchemists. Loans were not equity, and they had to be guided by what would work in practice.

Most everyone agrees that it would have been a lot better if these policy makers had the authority to liquidate Lehman in an orderly way; this was another classic example of how political constraints together with imperfectly thought-out legal constraints can get in the way of actions that are widely agreed to be beneficial.

On Sunday afternoon the news broke that Lehman was headed for bankruptcy, and all hell broke loose. The shock was way bigger than any before because of Lehman's size and interconnectedness to other vulnerable institutions, which made it clear that the contagion would spread. Even worse, the government's failure to save it raised doubts about whether it could save the system. Lehman's failure was particularly scary because of its large and poorly understood interconnectedness with the rest of the financial system.

There were a couple of major channels of potential contagion. The most important (and least clear) was Lehman's substantial presence in derivatives markets. At the time of its bankruptcy, Lehman was a party to between \$4 and \$6 trillion worth of exposure in CDS, accounting for about 8 percent of the total market. Though many of these exposures were offsetting—Lehman did not actually owe huge sums on net—its failure sent clients scrambling to find new counterparties. At the time, no one knew how large Lehman's net exposure was, or who was on the other side of it; we were crossing the line into a big, disastrous unknown. On September 11, we wrote in the Daily Observations:

The uncertainty of this situation is tremendous. What happens when you go to settle a currency forward transaction with a counterparty that suddenly doesn't exist? Maybe everything goes fine, but maybe some unexpected condition bites you in the ass. What if you haven't been collecting mark-to-market gains from one of your dealers (we collect constantly from everyone), they go down, and now you are a general creditor? Who do you transfer the risk to? Maybe Merrill is right behind Lehman. What do you about that? And who might be behind it? If everyone is asking these questions the natural path is to cut back on trading and concentrate positions with a few firms. But these few firms have the incentive to ration their capacity to the highest quality financial institutions and managers. The inevitable result is substantially lower liquidity, higher transactions cost, and higher volatility. Higher volatility then feeds back into the real economy because people and businesses transact at these prices. And capital constraints in the financial sector mean that credit growth remains low, which undermines economic growth. We are getting very close to crossing this line.

While Lehman's bankruptcy was the largest in US history (and still is), with some 600 billion in reported assets, it was only about two-thirds the size of Goldman Sachs, and a quarter as large as JPMorgan. They were all connected and the losses and liquidity problems were spreading fast.

We called this stage of the crisis the "avalanche"—the point at which a smaller problem in one corner of the financial system (subprime mortgages) was building in self-reinforcing ways into much bigger problems, and fast.

# Aftermath of the Lehman Collapse: September 15-18

On Monday morning, September 15, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and the stock market fell by nearly 5 percent. No industry was spared, though the financial sector took the brunt of the pain, with shares of banks and insurers falling by about 10 percent. Credit spreads blew out and credit flow ground to a halt. Over the course of the following week, markets, policy makers, and we at Bridgewater struggled to figure out the ripple effects from Lehman, which of course we couldn't because the interrelationships and exposures were too complex and too opaque. It was clear to us that blanket protections would have to be put into place, because the consequences of the uncertainties themselves would be devastating as everyone ran from any entity that could go under. But if policy makers couldn't or wouldn't save Lehman Brothers, how could they save the system?

One of the Fed's immediate responses, announced the night before, was an unprecedented expansion in the "Primary Dealer Credit Facility": They were willing to lend to investment banks against almost any collateral, including extremely risky instruments—e.g., equities, subprime mortgages, and junk bonds. It should have been seen as an enormous step for a central bank to take, and in a more normal environment, it would have been. But the Lehman collapse overshadowed it.

Paulson would later write in his book that he felt constrained from even being able to explain in a forthright way why Lehman had failed without creating more problems—a common issue policy makers face when communicating during a crisis. As he put it:

"I was in a painful bind that I all too frequently found myself in as a public official. Although it's my nature to be forthright, it was important to convey a sense of resolution and confidence to calm the markets and to help Americans make sense of things…I did not want to suggest that we were powerless. I could not say, for example, that we did not have the statutory authority to save Lehman—even though it was true. Say that and it would be the end of Morgan Stanley, which was in far superior financial shape to Lehman but was already under an assault that would dramatically intensify in the coming days. Lose Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs would be next in line—if they fell, the financial system might vaporize and with it, the economy."[40]

With big questions on the direction policy was heading, I wrote the following note to our clients on September 15:

# (BDO) September 15: Where We Are Now

We have known about the losses that had to be taken by financial institutions for some time. They were discussed and conveyed to you in the tables that we sent to you repeatedly, over the last year. So, these problems were known. We described them as 'known and manageable' because, besides being known, we felt that they were manageable via sensible government policies—of providing liquidity (by the Fed), changing accounting rules and/or creating a safety net (by the Treasury, in cooperation with Congress)—and then clearly articulating these policies to provide the necessary confidence that would allow the debt restructuring process to progress in an orderly manner…

While we are still trying to figure out what the Treasury and Fed's approaches are, over the last few days they made some more things clear by innuendo. They made clear that they're willing to take the chance of diving into the depths of the scary unknown without a clear safety net in place. So, now we sit and wait to see if they have some hidden trick up their sleeves or if they really are as reckless as they seem. With interest rates heading toward 0 percent, financial intermediaries broken and the deleveraging well under way, it appears that we are headed into a new domain in which the classic monetary tools won't work and the Japan in the 1990s and US in the 1930's dynamic will drive things.

Meanwhile, reports came in showing how the financial meltdown was passing to the economy, leading it to plummet. A Fed report showed industrial output down sharply in August; AIG saw its credit ratings downgraded, potentially triggering additional collateral requirements; and Hewlett-Packard announced it was cutting 25,000 jobs. With America's financial system obviously in crisis, the problems quickly spread globally, prompting European and Asian central banks to announce new liquidity provision measures to shore up their own markets.

Credit markets were in turmoil. As financial players sorted through the tangle of counterparty risks and obligations created by Lehman's failure, interbank lending seized up and Libor (the rate at which banks lend to each other) settled at almost twice the prior week's levels. The contagion was spreading to everyone, even the strongest. Privately, executives from blue-chip firms like

Financial Crisis Enters New Phase

"The financial crisis entered a potentially dangerous new phase on Wednesday when many credit markets stopped working normally as investors around the world frantically moved their money into the safest investments, like Treasury bills."

New York Times

GE admitted to regulators that even they were having trouble borrowing in the commercial paper market, which could put them in a cash-flow bind and force them to default. Prime money market funds started to register increasing stress, high redemptions, and losses (we'll discuss this in more detail a little later). By the end of the day, credit spreads on Morgan Stanley widened to levels greater than those for Lehman on Friday.

Throughout the day, regulators scrambled to keep up with AIG's rapid decline. AIG was one of the largest insurers, with around \$1 trillion in assets at peak. Its problems centered around it having issued hundreds of billions of dollars of insurance contracts on bonds (called CDS and CDOs), which required it to pay out if a bond faced losses. Many of these insured bonds were repackaged subprime mortgages, so AIG was exposed to a staggering amount of losses. Since many other financial institutions were counting on these insurance contracts, AIG was systemically important. And it looked to be heading toward failure fast. On Sunday, it had said it would need \$40 billion in funding. Now, just a day later, it was suggesting it would need 85 billion.[41]

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/7b97371a0557a4fd367b50cfd30fc6321abf8faf0b79b00111545f330890d7bc.jpg)

On Tuesday, the Fed made two surprising policy moves—one far bolder than expected, the other more timid. On the one hand, the Fed, in a regularly scheduled meeting to set interest rates, decided not to change them, when the market expected them to be lowered—a significant disappointment that hurt the markets. Remarkably, even as the market looked to be on the verge of a depression, the Fed remained concerned about inflation, putting in their statement, "The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the Committee." In his memoir, Bernanke would later write that "in retrospect, that decision was certainly a mistake," caused in part by "substantial sentiment at the meeting in favor of holding our fire until we had a better sense of how the Lehman situation would play out."[42]

However, more importantly, the Fed also made an announcement that redefined the limits of US central banking. It courageously announced that it would provide 85 billion in emergency funding to AIG. The deal, drafted in a rush on the afternoon of Tuesday, September 16, came with tough terms attached. AIG would pay a floating interest rate starting at 11.5 percent, while giving the government an 80 percent ownership stake in the company. Because AIG did not have enough safe financial assets to secure the loan, it pledged nearly everything else it owned as collateral—including its insurance subsidiaries, financial services companies, and various real estate holdings (including a ski resort!). The Fed loan worked because the market believed AIG was solvent (because of the value of its insurance subsidiaries, which had investment-grade credit ratings). The fact that these served as collateral for the Fed's loan was also critical to the Fed's decision.[43]

But even under these terms, the loan was an unusually risky one for the Fed—after all, the companies AIG put up as collateral were not nearly as easy to value or to sell as the AAA securities the Fed accepted in normal times. And there was still a risk that AIG would go under, despite the Fed's help. Geithner would later say, "Deciding to support AIG was one of the most difficult choices I have ever been involved in in over 20 years of public service."[4]

News of AIG's bailout did not lift markets on Wednesday. Instead, stocks slid by about 4.7 percent, with shares of major financial institutions down by double digits. Rates on commercial paper continued to rise, while yields on three-month treasury bills fell to just above 0 percent (down from around 1.6 percent a week before) as investors fled to safety. Through this chaos, regulators announced a series of stabilizing measures. The SEC moved to tighten controls over short sellers (a common crisis response), and bank regulators proposed revisions to accounting rules to help dress up bank balance sheets.

Let's spend a minute on the importance of accounting, especially mark-to-market accounting. For banks, some assets are "marked-to-market," which means that every day banks take a look at what they could sell those assets for, and value them at those prices. Other assets are allowed to be valued in different ways, often by an in-house methodology that depends on the asset. When an asset that banks are required to mark-to-market is selling at fire-sale prices, any bank holding it looks like they are taking significant losses, which reduces their capital and thus requires them to raise money or sell assets, which further strains liquidity and puts further downward pressure on assets. It also scares the hell out of people dealing with them. Accounting changes that allow banks to realize losses over a longer time period (i.e., not marking assets to market) prevents some of these problems. Of course, changing accounting rules to hide losses during a financial crisis doesn't engender confidence either, so regulators have to be careful.

But accounting changes wouldn't change the more fundamental issue—that overindebted US households and financial institutions were defaulting on their debts because they were overlevered. It was clear that financial institutions needed to be recapitalized (e.g., via an equity investment), and they needed to find buyers for their more troubled assets. So Paulson turned to Congress for funding and authorization for the Treasury department to play that role.

# The Government Comes Up with a Bailout Fund: September 18-31

Paulson, Bernanke, and congressional leaders (most importantly, Barney Frank) thought the best way to restore confidence was to buy troubled assets through what would become the Troubled Asset Relief Program. They could have pursued nationalizing the banks, but there was no precedent for it in the US, and when banks were nationalized in other countries, they were penalized with harsh terms. For that reason, banks were reluctant to accept capital and nationalization until just before or immediately after they failed. Paulson did not believe this was the way to go, because it would be more damaging than helpful to the task of reviving capital flows.

Buying assets seemed sensible because a big source of the banks' problems were the large amounts of complex, highly illiquid mortgage securities on their balance sheets. The theory was that if the government provided some market for them, prices would rise, capital would be freed up, and confidence would be restored, allowing the banking system to begin to recapitalize.

When Wall Street learned about the possible TARP plan on Thursday, the market rose. The rally continued on Friday, with stocks up 4 percent, as more of the details emerged. President Bush and Secretary Paulson announced that the federal government was prepared to spend  \$500 billion to buy up troubled mortgages, while congressional leaders promised to act quickly to pass any proposal. Then the Fed unveiled\$ 180 billion in new swap lines for global central banks, somewhat easing fears of a dollar liquidity crunch in foreign markets. The SEC instituted a ban on the short-selling of nearly 800 financial stocks. And Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley came under the government's legal authority to provide a blanket of protection by voluntarily becoming bank holding companies, giving them greater access to the Fed's lending channels.

The Treasury also unveiled a creative new move to shore up troubled money market funds, which held 3.5 trillion. Money market funds had become very popular as an alternative to bank deposits for both retail and institutional investors. Most investors were attracted by their high interest rates and undeterred by their lack of FDIC protection; they didn't appreciate that they were delivering those higher interest rates by investing in higher-yielding and higher-risk loans. They also believed that they would not lose money in them as their principal was protected.

Prime money-market funds had been a crucial source of liquidity for all kinds of businesses, since they buy commercial paper, a type of short-term debt that businesses use to fund their operations. Because the commercial paper they hold is generally diversified and highly rated, these funds are usually considered almost riskless—like CDs or bank deposits. But a few prime funds took losses when Lehman failed, specifically the Reserve Primary Fund, which

"broke the buck" on September 16. Fears that others might take losses caused many investors to pull their money. As the dollars flowed out of these funds, they had to liquidate their holdings of commercial paper. The result was that hundreds of billions of dollars that had been funding the day-to-day operations of businesses dried up in a matter of days.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/15657400526c9445d40e575a6004dd8e929b6d48c414d70989e2498ba7a06b61.jpg)

After the Reserve Fund broke the buck, Ken Wilson, who was at Treasury at the time, had gotten a call at 7 a.m. from Northern Trust, followed by others from Black Rock, State Street, and Bank of New York Mellon. All of them reported runs on their money-market funds. Meanwhile, GE had been in the news, explaining that they couldn't sell their paper. Then Coca-Cola CFO Muhtar Kent called and said they were going to be unable to make their 800 million quarterly dividend payment at the end of the week because they couldn't roll their paper. Even AAA-rated industrialand consumer-products companies couldn't roll their paper! The situation was very quickly metastasizing from Wall Street to Main Street.

To stop the run on money-market funds, Paulson decided to guarantee them outright. The only problem was that the funds would need a substantial backstop and the Treasury couldn't immediately find the cash. To get around the problem, Treasury officials turned to a creative source—tapping the  \$50 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) to back up its guarantee. This plan was announced Friday, September 19, four days after the Lehman collapse. Treasury Secretaries can get into big trouble if they spend money that hasn't been appropriated. So Paulson got his general counsel to give him an opinion that he could use that\$ 45 billion, since if the whole economy went down it wouldn't be good for the dollar.[45] Some of Paulson's colleagues questioned whether \$45 billion would be enough, given that there were \$3.5 trillion worth of money-market funds. Paulson didn't know if it would be, but he didn't have a better idea.

The Treasury team was moving so fast that Sheila Bair (the head of the FDIC) called and complained that not only was she not consulted, but because of the guarantee all of the money would now go from bank deposits to money-market funds. That was a good point. So the Treasury clarified that the guarantee was only applicable to money-market funds that were in trouble as of September 19. The guarantee worked incredibly well and markets immediately turned. According to Paulson, this was because when you say something is a guarantee and not just a backstop, it is much more reassuring to investors.

The ESF was meant to be used to defend the dollar against runs, but its mandate was flexible enough that the fund could be diverted to more pressing uses. And it could be done quickly, with only presidential approval. This was exactly the kind of quick thinking and creativity that was required to navigate the regulatory and political minefield and get what was needed done.

The coordinated and comprehensive policy shifts were a relief to investors. Our Daily Observations from the day speaks for itself:

# (BDO) September 18: Great Moves!

The Treasury, Fed, and Congress finally agreed to agree to build the safety net!!!

Overnight central banks added 180 billion in liquidity!

Regulators moved against short sellers.

Morgan Stanley was frozen and is about to be dealt with, and Goldman isn't far behind, but moves are in the works to deal with them.

The week's optimism faded, however, as further details of TARP emerged (or, rather, failed to emerge) over the weekend. The formal proposal put forward by the Bush administration on Saturday, September 20, was three pages long, and was intended to be an outline rather than a fait accompli to Congress. The proposal, to be called TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program), called for 700 billion in purchases of mortgage-related assets, but offered few details on how these purchases would be administered or what other actions might be taken—and that amount of money was a pittance in comparison to the need. As we explained to our clients when the bill was first unveiled, troubled asset purchases couldn't have much impact on their own:

# (BDO) September 25: The Proposed Plan Disappoints:

Buying up 700 billion in mortgages (along with some other assets) will hardly help us at all. If these mortgages are bought at market prices it won't change the financial conditions of nearly anyone materially, the mortgages will be a small percentage of the amount that needs to be bought, and the action won't deal with most of the problems that exist. If they are bought at a premium, this will be both an unethical direct subsidy that is on the wrong side of the line, and it will mean that the amount of money spent will buy less and it still won't contain the problems.

To make matters worse, legislators were put off by the unchecked authority the bill would give the Treasury, so getting it through Congress wasn't assured. When markets opened on Monday, stocks sold off, closing down 3.8 percent and the dollar fell against most major currencies.

The evolving story of the TARP bill's difficult journey through Washington DC—set against a backdrop of poor economic releases and icy credit markets—drove the ups and downs throughout the week of September 22. Most importantly, political struggles between those who wanted to provide the support and those who didn't drove the markets Monday through Wednesday. As Bernanke and Paulson urged immediate action in testimony before Congress on Tuesday, President Bush addressed the nation in support of TARP on Wednesday. Yet little apparent progress came out of Congress. Legislative momentum was interrupted by debates over the need for a more comprehensive bill with more significant aid for homeowners and better-defined limits on the authority of the Treasury. Compensation for executives at banks became a hot-button issue. Many other issues that had some politicians antiand others proled to lots of arguing and little progress.

As is classic in deleveraging scenarios, this political debate took on populist overtones. Though congressional leaders mostly supported the bill, rank-and-file members argued that it would be like a handout to the banks that caused so much trouble in the first place. Arguing over who ought to bear the costs is

A Recovery in Shares on Hopes of a Bailout

-New York Times typical during deleveragings and highly counterproductive; it can be like doctors in the emergency ward arguing over who will pay the bill. All attention needs to be directed to saving the patient—how the costs should be handled can be decided later.

Even proposing the TARP bill was risky. If it didn't pass, there was likely to be an extremely negative market reaction. And they needed it passed in very difficult circumstances: as soon as possible, weeks before a presidential election and amid a populist uproar from both the left and the right over its unprecedented size and scope. Given the vote counts in Congress, the bill would need to pass on a bipartisan basis, which by this point was extremely rare on any new important law (and has become even rarer since). If either of the presidential candidates opposed the bill, it would have been nearly impossible to get passed—McCain and Palin initially taking an anti-bailout position put the bill at risk, though they eventually supported it. (Paulson was on the phone almost daily with both presidential candidates.) The only factor working in the bill's favor was that it usually takes a crisis to get Congress to act, and the financial crisis was in its most acute stage. The difficulties in getting TARP passed are a good illustration of why regulators need broad emergency authorities versus needing to rely on Congress to act.

Financial markets pulsated in response to each undulation between "they will" and "they won't" do what was necessary in time. Credit spreads on CDS for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which had narrowed following their transformations into bank holding companies over the weekend, widened through the week, and huge outflows from prime money-market funds and into government funds continued to put pressure on commercial paper. On Thursday night, the FDIC seized control of Washington Mutual, marking the largest bank failure in American history, before shifting its assets to JPMorgan in a 1.9 billion deal (they would seize Wachovia a few days later). As we wrote on Friday, September 26, "There is so much jam packed into each day that it is hard to pick what to comment on. The big picture through which we see all the daily news is that we are in the avalanche phase of the deleveraging."

The political stalemate in Congress seemed to break early Sunday morning, as Secretary Paulson, flanked by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, announced that an agreement had been reached on a 700 billion bailout bill.

But when the bill came up for a vote on Monday afternoon, it failed. Stocks fell 8.8 percent in the largest single-day drop since 1987. Around the world, reverberations sent markets spiraling downward; oil prices fell by 10 because in a depression the demand for it would be much less. Central banks, meanwhile, scrambled to offer emergency loans to shell-shocked institutions. Interbank lending markets froze, while rates on short-term treasuries fell to just above zero.

Again, among the most important aspects of successfully managing a crisis is having wise and knowledgeable decision-makers who have the authority to do whatever it takes. The Congressional vote was a sign that the Treasury would have to struggle to get the authority it needed. At the time, we wrote:

# (BDO) September 29: A Credibility Test

The financing of US consumption and the global financial system operates on faith. Recent developments have obviously strained the faith in the financial system. Today's failure in the House of the bill, whose passage was assured by those supposedly in control, has shined the global spotlight on US decision makers. The question of whether the US can do what needs to get done has been further complicated. In the end, the world's financiers (China, OPEC) will decide whether US policy makers have passed the test.

Even had the bailout passed, maintaining the necessary global faith in the system would have been difficult. Today the degree of difficulty has risen and the risk of a loss of faith has increased given the chaotic process and lack of leadership illustrated in Washington. There is still a lot to lose.

Officials at the Treasury and Congressional leaders were working around the clock to get the bailout bill passed. The process was painful: Convincing Republicans and Democrats to work together is hard enough during a normal year, but TARP was being considered only a month before a hotly contested presidential election. Republicans hated to look as though they were abandoning their free-market principles and their commitment to fiscal responsibility just to support a bank bailout. Democrats worried about giving a major legislative win to an outgoing Republican administration just before an election. And both Obama and McCain worried that the other would try to bolster his populist credentials by taking a stand against a so-called "Wall Street bailout." If that happened, Paulson worried, the bill would have little chance of passing.[46]

But politics wasn't the only headache associated with TARP. While the Treasury had been working with Congress to get TARP passed, two of the biggest bank failures in US history occurred (WaMu and Wachovia), and several European countries had to step up and bail out their own banks. Treasury officials could see that  \$700 billion in purchases of toxic assets wouldn't be enough to rescue markets. But if the money was put directly into the banks as capital, they could buy many times the\$ 700 billion because they could lever up.

Even though they said they weren't going to put capital in the banks through TARP, they pushed to get authority to do it if necessary. The question would be how to do it fast and well. Rather than try to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy banks, an analytical nightmare, which would have prompted a lot of arguing and would have taken more time than they had while stigmatizing the banks they supported (which could have worsened the runs), the Treasury instead offered to buy preferred stocks on very attractive terms. This allowed it to put capital into 700 banks very quickly.

What Paulson did was enormously unpopular because, understandably, the public wanted to punish the banks. In my opinion, the move was necessary and appropriate. It also worked out very well for the taxpayer, because the money that went into TARP's capital programs prevented a catastrophic collapse, which would have been as bad or worse than the Great Depression—not to mention that it all came back plus an almost 50 billion profit for the

taxpayers. This willingness to do the unpopular but right things to benefit people is both heroic and underappreciated. Too many people who have never actually been on the field throw beer cans from the stands. This can lead to disastrous results, unless the players are smart enough and courageous enough to do what is right despite the unpopularity of doing it.

With a lot of negotiating, TARP eventually got through, which was an extraordinary accomplishment because it was a very rare, consequential bipartisan action from Congress. As you can imagine, everyone was on pins and needles because of the enormity of the uncertainties. As with most such cases, it took being at the edge of the precipice to bring about the coordinated action to do the right thing. While it would be great if policy makers could take the right steps early on to prevent such crises, that's unfortunately not consistent with how political systems work. From having been through a bunch of these sorts of dramas in many countries over many years, I can attest that political systems typically make the right decisions only after heated fighting and literally just hours before disaster is about to strike.

But by the time the bill passed on October 3, there was broad agreement among investors that the bill wouldn't be enough. Stocks sold off 1.4 percent.

# October 2008

For policy makers, the first days of October were a scramble to get as much done in as short a time as possible. With the economy deteriorating daily, nearly every regulatory department had a major policy change in the works, each with its own roadblocks, tradeoffs, and benefits.

At the FDIC, regulators worked on raising the ceiling on deposit coverage. The FDIC's analysts knew they needed to provide more coverage—Depression-style bank runs on Wachovia had made that clear—but they also worried that raising the limit too high would draw depositors from foreign banks with lower limits, choking off liquidity in Europe and Asia. So they settled on a compromise measure—raising the limit from  $100,000 to$ 250,000 on October 3 as part of the same bill that authorized TARP—hoping it would be enough to ease pressure on struggling banks but not so much that it would start a deposit-insurance war with foreign regulators. The FDIC later followed up with the Transaction Account Guarantee Program that fully guaranteed non-interest bearing transaction accounts at participating banks.

Every day, a new wave of bad news hammered stocks. The economy was sinking fast. In the first week of October alone, PMI (a survey of purchasing managers) came in well below expectations, data on factory orders showed a 4 percent decline in August, and a payroll report showed a loss of 159,000 jobs in September—marking the worst month in five years. The following week, similarly grim economic stats came out in retail sales (down 7.7 percent year over year).

During this period of constant bad news, stocks sold off literally every day. Between October 1 and October 10, investors in the S&P 500 took total losses of 22 percent, without a single day of gains. Crude oil continued to fall rapidly as well, ending the first half of the month at 75 per barrel. Some days saw huge routs even when there wasn't much news. On October 9, for instance, stocks sold off 7.6 percent on record volume, with virtually nothing important enough to warrant it.

This acute pain wasn't concentrated only in the financial sector. Reports surfaced that major nonfinancial corporations were relying on credit lines to finance continuing operations as they found themselves all but shut out of corporate paper markets. Some companies announced that they were slashing dividends to keep up cash reserves, and outflows from prime money-market funds continued. In the household sector, a report showed that consumer credit had fallen in August for the first time since 1998. Similar stories were unfolding globally, as liquidity dried up in every major market, even as central banks announced unprecedented interventions.

# In the face of so much pain, policy makers rolled out ever-larger initiatives to thaw frozen credit markets and ease concerns throughout the financial system.

On October 7, for instance, the Fed announced an extraordinary new plan to purchase unsecured commercial paper. Since bank lending had been almost completely choked off and money-market funds had pulled hundreds of billions of dollars out of commercial paper markets, major nonfinancial companies were struggling just to continue funding normal operations. Fearing major layoffs and disruptions across the economy if these companies couldn't access funding, the Fed felt compelled to step in. To do so, it created what it called the Commercial Paper Funding Facility—technically an independent entity that would buy up

-New York Times commercial paper using loans provided by the Fed under its Section 13(3) powers. In practice, the Fed was agreeing to finance commercial paper purchases directly, with no backstop against losses by the Treasury. The move took the Fed to the edge of its statutory authority or perhaps a bit beyond (depending on who you ask), as the central bank is generally not permitted to take on much exposure with such risky credit. The Fed bravely did what it needed to do and hoped that the fees the CPFF charged borrowers could be used to cover any losses, though covering losses was appropriately not the primary objective.

Just days after the passage of TARP, Paulson began hinting that the funds might be used to capitalize the banks instead of just purchasing troubled assets, as he said he had been anticipating for weeks.[47] On October 9, at Paulson's urging, White House officials started to signal that TARP money might go to capital injections into banks.

There was so much to do, and policy-making needed to proceed at a furious pace. It was an utterly insane week.

The single largest push on the part of policy makers came over Columbus Day Weekend: October 11-13. On Saturday, October 11, President Bush met with members of the G7 in Washington to publicly commit himself to a coordinated international effort to contain what had become a global financial crisis. It was agreed that the members of the G7 would move together to inject capital into their banking institutions and increase deposit insurance guarantees. Over the next two days, officials from the Treasury raced to finalize America's part of the international commitment. The centerpieces of the new program were two bold new policy changes—a huge expansion of FDIC insurance coverage, and a massive injection of capital into the banking system.

Typically, the FDIC is only responsible for insuring the deposits of commercial banks. Under the new Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, however, the FDIC's authority had been stretched to guarantee the debt of any single systemically important bank and to backstop losses on all newly issued unsecured debt by banks and bank-holding companies as well as all noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. This amounted to a guarantee of nearly all bank debt. It was an extraordinary measure that many feared might have serious unintended consequences, but, as Paulson would later write, "To be frank, I hated these options, but I didn't want to preside over a meltdown."[48]

Under the new Capital Purchase Program, the Treasury planned to use its TARP money to take equity stakes in as many banking institutions as possible, up to a limit of 3 percent of risk-weighted assets or 250 billion. As explained earlier, the investments would come in the form of preferred stock with a 5 percent dividend.

Paulson needed even the healthiest banks to participate, because if only the weak ones did, participation would create a stigma that could encourage runs. And so, though the Treasury had no power to force banks to take capital, it did what it could. On Monday, October 13, Paulson invited the CEOs of nine major banks to his private conference room, and explained that he expected everyone in attendance to participate, and even prescribed the amount of capital he expected each bank to take. None left without taking government money. By the end of the meeting, Paulson had pledged \$125 billion of the \$700 billion Congress had given him.

But even with the cash injection, markets in the US, Europe, and Japan continued to worsen. So it became clear to Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner that they had to act with even greater force. Bernanke and Paulson had very consequential meetings with central bankers and the finance ministers in the G7 to coordinate an international response. Paulson and President Bush also met with G20 finance ministers. Meanwhile, there were teams moving very fast at the Treasury working to develop the US response. Several people took Paulson aside and warned him that they were perhaps moving too fast, and that doing so could be dangerous. However, Paulson believed that if policy makers did not move quickly, they would have nothing that would work when all the markets opened on Tuesday after the three-day Columbus Day weekend.[49]

Paulson says that the most powerful step they took was the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, in which the FDIC used its funds, which were established to protect savers, to guarantee the liabilities of financial institutions, including the unsecured liabilities of bank holding companies.[50] At one point, the FDIC's general counsel said this was illegal. However, Paulson and others spent a lot of time convincing its head, Sheila Bair, that this was the right thing to do, and she ultimately made the very courageous decision to back it—which made a huge difference.[51]

As news of the programs leaked on Monday, October 13 (and policy makers around the world announced similar projects), the markets that were open surged. Stocks rallied by 11.6 percent, the largest single-day increase in the S&P 500 since 1939.

It's worth pausing for a moment to consider how significant these announcements were in the larger story of the crisis. Up to this point, most of the government responses had come in the form of ad hoc reactions to individual disasters. The Fed had borne a disproportionately large share of the burden, and it was not at all clear that other agencies would adequately support it. But now it seemed increasingly clear that policy makers in the US and around the world were committed to taking extraordinary, coordinated action. Still, huge uncertainties lay ahead, as the underlying economy continued to deteriorate. Here's how we described this moment to our clients at the time:

# (BDO) October 13: The Governments Are Doing Everything Possible; Now We Will Have to See If It's In Time

These are great moves. They are doing everything that we had hoped that they would do. While these would have worked in stage one of the crisis—e.g., if they did them instead of allowing Lehman to go bankrupt—the crisis has spread to a stage 3 condition, so we just have to wait and see. The big question is whether the massive liquidity injections and bank recapitalizations will get to those who are at the periphery of the system.

Many dominos are now falling that are beyond the reach of government. We know of lots of them that are big and scary and we are sure that we don't know of many others. So, it is hard to know for sure how these big problems will be affected by these policy changes and what the effects of these big credit/ liquidity problems will be…

We are in very uncertain times. But, for the first time we can now say with confidence that the major developed countries' governments are doing all in their power to deal with this crisis.

October 27, 2008 White House Explores Aid for Auto Deal "The Bush administration is examining a range of options for providing emergency financial help to spur a merger between General Motors and Chrysler, according to government officials… People familiar with the discussions said the administration wanted to provide financial assistance to the deeply troubled Big Three Detroit automakers, possibly by using the Treasury Department's wide-ranging authority under the 700 billion bailout program that Congress approved this month."

The Fed Continues to Try to Get the Dollars

Where They Are Needed

"The Fed continues to push unprecedented liquidity into the system across a variety of channels. The unprecedented push of liquidity has more than doubled the Fed's balance sheet by increasing their assets and liabilities by nearly a trillion dollars, but it has still not offset the private sector need. The world has accumulated so many dollar debts, and the ability to roll and grow these debts was so ingrained in the financial system's architecture, that the breakdown requires the unprecedented push from the Fed. Nonetheless, the risks the Fed faces in embarking on this course are numerous, and so much of the global financial system lays out of the Fed's reach."

Fed Adds 21 Billion to Loans for A.I.G.

-New York Times

Fears and uncertainties surrounding the economy kept volatility extremely high over the next week. On Wednesday, for instance, stocks fell 9 percent following grim retail sales numbers for September and a warning from Bernanke that any "broader economic recovery" would be slow to arrive.[52] The following day, the market rebounded by 4.3 percent, even in the face of a number of disappointing stat releases, and rates on commercial paper fell slightly.

But by Monday, October 20, markets had registered a meaningful easing of conditions in interbank lending and commercial paper. Rates on commercial paper touched four-week lows, while short-term treasury yields crept up. This thawing of credit conditions helped lift stocks, and represented a significant easing of the pressure on banks.

Still, most of the financial mismatches that were squeezing financial institutions and companies (i.e., borrowing short term and lending longer term, borrowing in one currency and lending in another) had yet to be resolved. There was a squeeze for dollars because foreign financial institutions that had borrowed dollars and lent them out now had to pay them back, and/or had to deal with their debtors, who had to pay them back in dollars when dollars, money, and credit were hard to come by. Though the Fed continually expanded its dollar swap lines (i.e., liquidity lending) with developed-world central banks throughout October, it was not able to provide enough dollar liquidity to alleviate this global dollar squeeze. Part of the problem lay in central banks' reluctance to lend Fed-provided dollars against locally denominated collateral because of their fears of default and logistical issues. The largest squeeze occurred in emerging markets, where major dollar debts had built up and debtors were scrambling for dollars. All in all, the dollar rallied 8 percent in October.

Here's how we explained the situation to our clients at the time:

# (BDO) October 22: The Dollar Squeeze

A debt is a short cash position—i.e., a commitment to deliver cash that one doesn't have. Because the dollar is the world's reserve currency, and because of the dollar surplus recycling that has taken place over the past few years…lots of dollar denominated debt has been built up around the world. So, as dollar liquidity has become tight, there has been a dollar squeeze. This squeeze…is hitting dollar-indebted emerging markets (particularly those of commodity exporters) and is supporting the dollar. When this short squeeze ends, which will happen when either the debtors default or get the liquidity to prevent their default, the US dollar will decline. Until then, we expect to remain long the USD against the euro and emerging market currencies.

The actual price of anything is always equal to the amount of spending on the item being exchanged divided by the quantity of the item being sold (i.e.,  $\mathrm{P} =$  /Q), so a) knowing who is spending and who is selling what quantity (and ideally why) is the ideal way to get at the price at any time, and b) prices don't always react to changes in fundamentals as they happen in the ways characterized by those who seek to explain price movements in connection with unfolding news. During this period, volatility remained extremely high for reasons that had nothing to do with fundamentals and everything to do with who was getting in and out of positions for various reasons—like being squeezed, no longer being squeezed, rebalancing portfolios, etc. For example, on Tuesday, October 28, the S&P gained more than 10 percent and the next day it fell by 1.1 percent when the Fed cut interest rates by another 50 basis points. Closing the month, the S&P was down 17 percent—the largest single-month drop since October 1987.

# November-December 2008

In the midst of this chaos, on November 4, Barack Obama was elected President amid record turnout, and would come into office with big majorities in both houses of Congress. Heading into the election, Obama had promised billions in government spending on infrastructure, unemployment insurance, and Medicaid, and was supportive of TARP—and control of Congress would allow him to move quickly.

Creating Liquidity but Failing to Create Credit

Essentially, through some asset purchases and a series of swaps, the Fed has exchanged T-bills for other more illiquid, lower grade and longer duration credits, and through the process has provided many key entities with short term liquidity. But it hasn't been able to get a privately-funded credit expansion going because it is uneconomic for creditors to lend, especially when they are squeezed. Without a credit expansion, the deleveraging/depression will continue until ultimately there will be a global debt restructuring (i.e., diminishing the size of creditors' claims on debtors).

"While the Fed sowed the seeds of this crisis by allowing credit growth to be fast enough to cause rapid deteriorations in Americans' balance sheets (at first under Greenspan and then under Bernanke), and the Treasury allowed the deleveraging crisis to move beyond that which was manageable, the Fed behaved superbly once the deleveraging crisis became apparent to it, thereby mitigating the implosion in credit. It has quietly, imaginatively and aggressively redefined the optimal way that central banks should behave in depressions by essentially replacing, rather than relying on, impaired financial institutions to provide credit to key entities."

U.S. Shifts Focus in Credit Bailout

-New York Times

While the financial contagion may have been slowed by the Treasury and the Fed's actions so far, it became clearer in the last couple months of 2008 that the economy was falling at a far faster pace than even the most pessimistic observers feared, and that we were heading for the worst downturn since the Great Depression and into the great unknown.

To us the economy was now in the classic early days of a deleveraging/depression, when monetary policy could not work normally. Interest rates could no longer be lowered and innumerable avenues of credit had dried up.

Most of the important economic stats released in November were worse than the already very poor expectations. Consumer spending fell at an extraordinary rate; retail sales fell by over 8 percent and auto sales were down 30 percent year over year. Businesses across industries reacted to poor results with historic layoffs. The unemployment rate moved up past 6.8 percent, the highest level since 1994, and projections for layoffs and unemployment increased dramatically. December saw the worst manufacturing reading since 1982. The economy was imploding.

Businesses across industries looked to the federal government for aid to shore up their finances. The auto industry in particular remained in dire straits and actively sought backstops from the federal government. However, the Treasury department was reluctant to broaden the  \$700 billion TARP package to include industrial companies and was thus unwilling to assist major automakers. In early November, the Treasury turned down a request by General Motors for\$ 10 billion to help finance a possible merger with Chrysler. Without funding from the federal government and with credit markets remaining nonfunctional, automakers turned to selling assets to raise cash. Both Ford and General Motors sold their stakes in other automakers during the month.

On November 10, AIG reported a  \$25 billion quarterly loss (while securing an additional\$ 150 billion from the government to curtail financial contagion). Fannie Mae posted a \$29 billion loss and said it might need more than the \$100 billion the Treasury had already pledged to keep it afloat.

Paulson hadn't said anything publicly about how his thinking was changing, as he hadn't wanted to influence the election.[53] The market was expecting a significant asset repurchase program. However, in a mid-November postelection speech, Paulson announced his plans for modifying Treasury's use of TARP. He disclosed that Treasury no longer planned to buy illiquid assets because the market for these securities was frozen. Funds would instead be channeled to banks and nonbank financial companies (though not auto companies) as equity-like capital to better free them up to resume normal lending. Additionally, a new lending program was announced that was targeted at consumer lending markets. This new program allowed the Treasury to put up part of the funding for auto loans, credit cards, and student loans. The markets, however, reacted negatively to the adjustment. Paulson noted after the fact: "As I feared, the markets focused on the fact that there wouldn't be a program to purchase mortgage-related assets."[54] This rattled the markets and the S&P dropped 5.2 percent.

Stocks reached a new low on November 20, down over 20 percent for the month (and 52 percent from their highs). Oil collapsed (now below 50 a barrel), and home prices continued to fall. However, this new low was met with a relatively quick reversal on news that Obama would nominate Timothy Geithner to be Treasury secretary and Larry Summers (former Treasury secretary) to be director of the National Economic Council, as both were justifiably considered highly capable. Summers came into this job having been concerned about the possibility of a major debt crisis for a while (in a speech in early March before Bear's collapse, he had said, "I believe that we are facing the most serious combination of macroeconomic and financial stresses that the United States has faced in a generation—and possibly much longer than that,"[55] and he was an advocate of big policy moves in response to the crisis. He would end up as a key decision-maker in the administration's policy toward auto companies. Bernanke would of course stay at the Fed, so there was good continuity among the leaders of the economic team. These moves helped assure policy continuity between administrations.

On November 25, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury announced  \$800 billion in lending and asset purchases aimed at pushing down mortgage rates (to help the housing market). The central bank committed to purchases of\$ 600 billion in debt tied to home loans. This was their first Quantitative Easing (QE) program. This was a classic and critical step in managing a deleveraging. Central bankers in the midst of crises are forced to choose between 1) "printing" more money (beyond what's needed for bank liquidity) to replace the decline in private credit, and 2) allowing a big tightening as credit collapses. They inevitably choose to print, as they did in this case, which is when things changed dramatically.

I hope you will read the next section, about the US debt crisis in the 1928-37 period (as well as look at the other cases) to see how true this is. What was different in 2008 was the speed with which the policy makers made this crucial step. The 1930-33 depression went on so long because policy makers were so slow to react—not because their problems were

"Our economy's most basic problem is that many individuals' and companies' debt service payments are too large relative to the cash flows they produce to service them. As a result, they will have to go through debt restructurings that will write-down debts to levels that reduce required debt service payments to levels that are consistent with debtors' abilities to pay. Bankruptcy is the most common way of bringing about these restructurings. The more bankruptcies we have, and the sooner we have them, the quicker we can get this economic crisis behind us."

# The Balance Sheet Problem

"The thaw in credit markets since the Fed decided to inject equity into banks has been insufficient in preventing the avalanche of credit market selling. The freeze that continues in credit markets is evidenced by the breakdown of basic financing relationships in markets that were taken for granted as arbitrages when financing was available. The economy will be in free fall until new credit is available at rates that make sense given economic conditions, and new credit is unlikely to be made available at such rates while there are so many dislocations to take advantage of first. Today, there is just no willingness to use up balance sheet (create credit) for even arbitrages, much less the financing of new economic activity."

We wrote to clients on this announcement:

# (BDO) November 25: Why We Expect More Shock & Awe And What It Will Mean

Though we can't speak for them, we believe that the Fed and the new Treasury folks understand the deleveraging/depression dynamic and the seriousness of the one that we're in. In fact, we believe that their understanding is now quite similar ours, so they are doing what we would do, and that they will probably do about what we would do. Along these lines, we expect shock and awe type moves from both the Fed and the Administration (i.e., the Treasury and other departments).

Today's Fed's announced moves are just the latest steps down the path of continuing to broaden the securities bought and increase the amounts spent to bring down credit spreads and add liquidity to the system. We expect more because we expect that they will do "whatever it takes" that they can get away with.

Big policy announcements were also coming from other major countries as they saw their own economies slide. For instance, the UK government announced a

\$30 billion stimulus package (via a reduction in sales tax and measures to help homeowners, pensioners, and small businesses); China cut interest rates; and the EU outlined a\$ 258 billion fiscal plan. Other central banks also increased emergency lending measures (e.g., the Bank of Japan implemented a new provision allowing commercial banks to borrow unlimited funds from the central bank, collateralized). And in December, interest rates were lowered across the developed world as the global economy slowed.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/bef64a715ac7decce719b508f15fdf1b58236b4956c76f9b5dcbd593bc74b188.jpg)

Developed World Central Bank Policy Rates

As for the US Federal Reserve, it cut its overnight rate to its lowest level ever (between 0 percent and 0.25 percent), hitting the zero bound. Chairman Bernanke noted: "the decision was historic."[56] Stocks rallied and the dollar fell following the announcement, largely because it was clear that "printing money," buying debt, and providing big guarantees to do whatever was needed to reverse this debt/liquidity crisis would occur.

The increased likelihood of a deal with the auto companies funded from TARP also helped markets, not just because it helped those companies but because it was emblematic of a more forceful approach to saving the system. TARP was enacted to deal with financial institutions. Paulson repeatedly said that they didn't intend to use TARP funds for the autos, while the Bush Administration made it clear that it didn't want an auto bankruptcy and worked diligently with Congress to prevent one by trying to get the legislative authority to use a portion of the  \$25 billion that Congress had already appropriated to help the autos meet fuel efficiency standards for emergency loans for restructuring. There was real progress in this regard, with a bill passing in the House, but the legislation stalled in the Senate in mid-December. On December 19, just before leaving office, President Bush officially announced plans to extend\$ 13.4 billion in emergency loans to Chrysler and General Motors. By the end of the month, the government expanded this bailout package unexpectedly, delivering additional support to the auto industry (which buoyed stocks). Because TARP money could only be given to financial institutions, the funds had to be directed through the auto companies' financing arm. Additionally, the financing affiliate of General Motors (GMAC) was approved to reorganize as a bank (to receive federal aid), which allowed GMAC to start making new loans to less credit-worthy borrowers. After that, they then helped the auto companies by recapitalizing and rescuing their finance companies just before leaving office. The market was also optimistic about the fiscal stimulus being pledged by president-elect Obama. The transition exemplified the very best of political behavior on the part of both transitioning presidents. Also, the continuity of Bernanke and Geithner on the economic leadership team helped.

How So Many Investors Lost Money in 2008 & Lessons for the Future

"From our perspective, most investors lost money because:

1. They had a lot more exposure to beta than alpha.
2. The beta exposure was much more heavily in assets that do badly during economic bad times (e.g., stocks, private equity, real estate, bonds with credit risk, etc.) than in assets that do well in bad times (e.g. Treasury bonds).
3. The risk and liquidity premiums rose a lot (which happens in bad times).
4. The alphas typically had lots of systematic biases in them to do well in good times and to do badly in bad times—e.g., the average "hedge" fund has been about  $70\%$  correlated with stocks, so it's not surprising that hedge funds are down a lot when stocks are down a lot.

New York Times

While all these moves were big, there was of course good reason to question whether the damage already done was too great for a full recovery to occur. While stocks rallied on the hope of stimulus and progress with the automakers, December ended with volatility (uncertainty) priced to remain high.

Bridgewater closed out 2008 with significant gains for our investors, when most other investors had significant losses. What a year! What a relief!

Having the template explained in Part 1 and understanding the dynamics of the Great Depression in the 1930s as well as we did (and so many other deleveragings) helped us a lot. The chart below shows interest rates and money supply (M0) since 1925 to encompass both periods. In both cases they hit virtually 0 percent and in both cases "money printing" followed. Note that these were the only times since 1900 that these things happened, and that, in both cases, immediately following this "money printing"/QE the markets and the economy bottomed.

Quantitative easing is like a giant shot of adrenaline to save a patient that is having a massive heart attack. The only question I had in late 2008 was if this overdue and great move would work or if it had come too late.

# Transition from an "Ugly" to a "Beautiful" Deleveraging: 2009

It's worth briefly recapping where the US economy was at this point. Virtually every economic indicator looked to be falling extremely quickly. As an illustration, in a single day in January, reports of employment cuts across companies totaled 62,000. In addition to weak economic growth, there were still at least five major financial institutions at risk of failure: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, Citigroup, and Bank of America; each of these was bigger than Lehman. And a new, untested administration was about to be handed the reins. This note conveys our picture of the economy at the time:

# (BDO) January 9: The US Economy Remains in Freefall…

The US economy remains in free-fall with the impact of the credit contraction now hitting where it hurts most, employment. Initially the financial sector suffered, then demand and now employment. The transition from demand to employment was sealed when business revenues fell faster than costs in the fourth quarter, compressing margins and driving earnings down (not yet reported, but almost certainly occurred). Businesses were then motivated to cut their biggest expense item, labor. The extreme pace of payroll reductions, over 500 thousand per month in November and December, reflects business's attempt to sustain their operating earnings.

This is even more important than in most economic contractions given the lack of credit. The lack of credit means that businesses must generate cash flow internally; they cannot rely on a loan to get them through a cash bind. This magnifies the pressure to lay off workers.

When President Obama took office on January 20, the markets began to focus on the administration's economic policies. Secretary Geithner's announcement of his financial stability plan on February 10 was seen as a major bellwether for administration financial policies. He outlined $^{57}$  broadly how he was going to "clean up and strengthen the nation's banks." He explained that the approach would stress test the nation's major banks to determine which institutions needed additional capital and that the administration would shore up their capital with a combination of public and private funds. Investors were uncertain about the details of Geithner's plan: Would there be nationalizations; would losses be imposed on shareholders or taxpayers? Investors were provided only with the broad strokes, leaving them to expect the worst. The S&P fell 3 percent as Geithner spoke and ended the day down 4.9 percent.

Rumors that the Obama administration was considering nationalization continued to circulate, so the Treasury, FDIC, OCC, OTS, and the Federal Reserve released a joint statement to assure[58] the public that nationalization was a last resort outcome, stating: "Because our economy functions better when financial institutions are well managed in the private sector, the strong presumption of the Capital Assistance Program is that banks should remain in private hands." The "strong presumption" wasn't enough—the S&P fell 3.5 percent on the day.

Later in the month, Geithner released further details about the plan that the Treasury and Fed had collectively worked out for the "stress test": the Federal Reserve would assess how well the country's big banks would withstand a major contraction in the economy, defined as a 3.3 percent contraction in

The Eve of Nationalization?

While nationalization seems to us the best option it is still extremely dangerous. The goal of nationalization is to re-capitalize these institutions in an acceptable way, while sustaining the basic underlying infrastructure of the financial system.

GDP, 8.9 percent unemployment, and a 22 percent fall in housing prices. If they lacked the capital to withstand the stress test, banks would turn to private markets first and then public funds to fill the gap. Of course Geithner couldn't yet provide the funds until the Fed finished their assessment on how exactly the shortfall would be filled. For about 18 months, we had regularly run our own estimates of bank losses by analyzing their holdings, marking them to market, and then doing scenario analysis. We were pretty confident that our estimates were good. So we were eager to see what the Fed's stress tests would look like, mostly to see if they would forthrightly show the numbers and then deal with them.

In addition to Geithner's Financial Stability Plan, the Obama administration announced a series of other fiscal policies aimed at jumpstarting the economy and getting credit flowing again. We won't go into depth on all of them here, but will give some details about the two most meaningful announcements:

- On February 17, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The stimulus totaled  \$787 billion, with\$ 288 billion specifically set aside for tax reductions, \$144 billion for state and local governments, \$105 billion for infrastructure, and the rest for federal spending programs. Notably, the tax reduction was funneled to taxpayers within days—a virtually instantaneous stimulus. The infrastructure spending, on the other hand, would take years to ramp up as projects needed to be scoped and planned for, so it mattered less in the short term.

On February 18, the administration announced a plan worth up to \$275 billion to address the housing crisis. With the goal of helping "as many as nine million American homeowners refinance their mortgages or avert foreclosure," the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan offered \$75 billion in direct spending to keep at-risk homeowners in their homes. It also provided incentives to lenders to alter the terms of their loans to troubled borrowers to make them more affordable. And it gave Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac an additional 200 billion in financing.

Over the course of February, US policy makers also announced or expanded other policies—including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). TALF was a Fed policy which helped stimulate various types of consumer loans by lending up to 1 trillion on a non-recourse basis to holders of AAA asset-backed securities. It was set to begin on March 5 as an extension of a number of liquidity programs set to expire at the end of April. Despite all this stimulation, markets continued to fall, as shown in the chart below.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/cd98ac8259f85bd5e3d5b4bed2760b74693c744ff1429a59fd55ec9dbd7c7700.jpg)

Reports of ongoing weakness in the financial sector and economy continued to pile up. On Sunday March 1, news broke that AIG planned to report a  \$62 billion 4th quarter loss (the largest quarterly loss in US corporate history), and that the Treasury and Fed had agreed to provide AIG with an additional\$ 30 billion in capital and loosen the terms of its earlier loan to the insurer. Markets plunged on Monday as fear of knock-on effects were triggered and the first economic stat releases from February showed the economy contracting at an accelerating rate. Monthly auto sales fell 5.8 percent to the weakest level since the early 1980s and the economy shed 651,000 jobs.

The next week opened with more of the same. On Monday, March 9, the World Bank came out with a very pessimistic report and Warren Buffett said that the economy had "fallen off a cliff." The stock market fell by 1 percent. Investor sentiment was extremely bearish and selling was exhausted. That was the day the bottom in the US stock market and the top in the dollar were made, though it was impossible to know that at the time.

Stocks surged 6.4 percent on Tuesday, led by a 38 percent jump in Citigroup shares, following a memo to employees from Citigroup's CEO stating that the bank was once again profitable, a well-received speech by Chairman Bernanke on reforms to financial regulation, and reports that lawmakers were close to re-instituting the uptick rule to slow short-selling of stocks.

# Policy Makers Launch Coordinated Counterattack: March-April 2009

Behind the scenes, policy makers at the Fed and the Treasury department were planning a coordinated set of "shock and awe" policies designed to shore up the financial system and provide the money needed to make up for contracting credit. These policies were much more aggressive than earlier easings, and were released in a sequence of mega-announcements. How they were announced magnified the impact on markets.

The first of these announcements came on March 18 when, in a move that surprised markets, the Fed announced that it was expanding its QE purchases of Agency MBS by  \$750 billion and agency debt by\$ 100 billion, and that it would expand its purchases to US government bonds, making up to 300 billion in purchases over the next six months. In addition to increased QE, the Fed expanded the collateral that was eligible for TALF to a wider set of financial assets and stated its continuing expectations of "keeping rates exceptionally low for an extended period."

The market action around the 1 trillion plus announcement was huge. There was an enormous Treasury rally (the 48 basis point fall in yields was the biggest change in a couple of decades), stocks rallied, the dollar sold off, and gold rallied. The intraday charts below show how big the moves following the announcement were.

The Inevitable and Classic Central Bank Purchases

"Rather than being a surprise, today's Fed moves were an inevitable, necessary and very classic step in the D-process. In fact, the way we run our calculations, the Fed's purchases of Treasury securities will end up being in the vicinity of  $1.5 -$ 2.0 trillion.

At the big picture level, events are transpiring in the very classic way that happens in depressions and that is outlined in our "Template for Understanding What's Going On," except the Fed is understandably doing these things earlier in the process than is typical. Those who run the Fed are clearly trying to prevent the debt restructuring phase and go directly to the credit creation phase by doing all the classic debt relief things now. So are the folks in the administration. In addition to printing money, these will include initiatives to encourage credit creation (e.g., TALF, PPIF, etc.), and accounting and regulatory forbearance."

Then, on March 23, Secretary Geithner announced an expanded set of policies that aimed to buy  \$500 billion to\$ 1 trillion worth of troubled assets from banks. At the heart of the program was the three-part Public-Private Investment Partnership (PPIP), which incentivized private investment firms to buy banks' bad assets using their own capital. In effect, it allowed firms to leverage their investments in troubled assets using money borrowed from the Fed, with a guarantee that they would not lose more than their initial investment if the assets fell below their initial value. In another move coordinated with the Fed, Geithner also announced a possible expansion of TALF, to finance residential and commercial MBS, and said the agencies were considering making legacy securities eligible for the program.

On the day of the announcement, the S&P rose 7.1 percent led by an 18 percent rally in financial shares.

On March 24, The Fed and the Treasury each announced plans to overhaul financial regulations and expand government power in seizing "too big to fail" banks, as well as insurers, investment banks, and other investment funds. Two days later, Secretary Geithner outlined a wider overhaul of financial regulations, which greatly increased federal regulatory oversight of insurance companies, hedge funds, and private equity funds, with expanded regulatory powers over any company deemed "too big to fail." While not a key part of the stimulative counter-attack, the move was well-received by markets.

At the end of March, Summers and Geithner oversaw a team led by Steven Rattner, a smart financier, to create the plan that would push GM and Chrysler into what Larry Summers described as a "cushioned bankruptcy." Bankruptcy would force the trade unions and creditors to negotiate ways to reduce debts, and ample US government support (including a large guarantee of GM's car guarantees) would ensure that GM could remain functioning while the company was restructured. While the automobile companies felt they couldn't function in bankruptcy, Summers thought that, with sufficient support, a bankrupt automobile company could function, and that there was no reason that the debt needed to be paid in full.

And then on April 2 came two major announcements. In the first, the G20 reported that it had reached an agreement on a greater than what we expected increase to IMF funding. Specifically, G20 countries agreed to immediately provide  \$250 billion in additional IMF financing, with the aim of eventually adding up to\$ 500 billion in new lending capacity to the IMF's roughly 250 billion of existing liquid resources. The combination of dramatically expanded IMF lending capacity and more flexible lending terms was expected to dramatically reduce the immediate liquidity needs of a number of emerging-market countries. Emerging currencies soared following the announcement.

The second announcement came from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which had passed two proposals to ease mark-to-market accounting rules. The changes, which had been expected to pass for a couple of weeks, gave banks more discretion in reporting the value of mortgage securities. While markets embraced the move, at the time we thought that these changes would have relatively little impact on banks' abilities to write off losses over time, while relieving some (but not all) of the accounting pressures on insurance companies.

The size of the coordinated government response to the credit crisis was unprecedented. At the time, we characterized the moves as "an enormous wave." The first table below, which we shared with our clients at the time, adds up all of the US government purchases and guarantees that had been announced by April 2009. Remarkably, the US government was backstopping two-thirds of all debt, about 29 trillion dollars.

A little later in April, we wrote in reference to the degree of money printing and stimulus spending: "Like pandemics, D-processes come along very infrequently, so we don't have many to look back on and, in those that we have, this antidote was never administered in this dosage."

In these crises there is no such thing as getting everything exactly right, especially in the eyes of everyone. There was a public uproar over the Treasury's actions, especially about how "generous" its deal was for banks that were recapitalized, and how bankers weren't being punished. Reports that A had paid large, previously-committed bonuses after it received a bailout from the Treasury focused on how Secretary Geithner knew about the bonuses and allowed them to be paid out. The reports infuriated a public already upset with government bailouts of financial institutions and put the Treasury's plans for further action at risk.

Such reactions are classic. As economic pain increases, populist calls to "punish the bankers that caused this mess" are the norm and they make it difficult for policy makers to take the actions that are necessary to save the financial system and the economy. At such times bankers can want to stop "being bankers" by stopping investing or lending. Their doing so in the midst of the crisis would make the crisis much worse.

While the financial crisis and how it was handled contributed somewhat to the rise of populism in subsequent years, in the end saving the system is much more important than striving for precision. Larry Summers makes the comparison to battlefield medicine—it's never perfect, you're going to realize you made mistakes, and you're going to look bad, even if you do the best possible job. I can't say this enough: in my opinion, judging the policy makers in this way is unfair. The fact that they do their job anyway, and that they help as many people as they do, is what makes them heroes in my eyes.

In mid-March, at the peak of the controversy, members of Congress and the media were publicly calling for Secretary Geithner's resignation, even though he had executed his job with great skill, wisdom, and care. Had they succeeded in forcing a resignation or otherwise derailed the Treasury's bold and necessary plans to recapitalize the banking system, the bad economic consequences would have been large.

Geithner wrote the following in his book, conveying the challenge of handling public outrage:

"The public outrage was appropriate, and I understood why the President wanted to embrace it, but I didn't see how we could ever satisfy it. We had no legal authority to confiscate the bonuses that had been paid during the boom. We had no power to set compensation for most private firms. We had more authority over firms receiving TARP funds, but we couldn't reduce bonuses to levels that the public might find acceptable without unleashing an exodus of talent from those banks, reducing their prospects of navigating their way to safety. In any case, I thought the public's rage on these issues was insatiable. I feared the tougher we talked about the bonuses, the more we would own them, fueling unrealistic expectations about our ability to eradicate extravagance in the financial industry."[59]

Existing-Home Sales Rise for a Second Month

-New York Times

The uproar ultimately faded after President Obama strongly stood behind Tim. But after what was seen as Geithner's lack of action, the House of Representatives passed a bill on March 19 that put a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid out by companies that received government bailouts worth 5 billion or more. While the scope of the tax was limited mostly to the AIG bonuses, the sense of distrust for government support among many executives in the financial sector (who saw the tax as the government changing the rules after the fact) would be a continuing source of tension.

Fortunately, the bottoms in the markets and the economy were being made, because had things gotten any worse or gone on any longer our capitalist and democratic system would've been at risk of breaking. All else being equal, prices for goods, services, and investment assets go down when a rate of buying lessens and go up when the rate of selling lessens. For that reason, tops are typically made when the rate of buying is unsustainable (which is also when people think prices will rise) and bottoms are made when the rate of selling is at a pace that's unsustainable (typically when most people are bearish). In the weeks before and after the big announcements, pressures eased, signs of an economic rebound emerged, and markets rallied. A series of economic releases during the first week of April showed that while the economy continued to contract during March, the pace of contraction was slower than expected. And as the charts below show, while the major economic stats continued contracting through March at the fastest pace in decades, the contractions looked to be leveling off and maybe reversing.

By mid-April, stock and commodity markets around the world had rebounded sharply from their March lows. The S&P was up 25 percent, oil was up over 20 percent, and bank CDS spreads fell almost 30 percent, but in level terms they remained near their extremes. This appeared to be due more to a slower rate of selling than a pickup in buying.

The obvious question at the time was whether a bottom was being made or if we were just seeing another bear market rally. After all, there had been a number of classic bear market rallies along the way—e.g., the S&P had staged a 19 percent rally over a week at the end of October and a 24 percent rally over the last six weeks of 2008 before giving up the gains of each and hitting new lows.

# The Bank Stress Test

One of the key questions for determining whether the US was headed for a sustained recovery was the health of the banks. Despite recent drips of good news, there wasn't broad transparency on whether the banks were still encumbered by toxic assets or a big need for capital. We had been running our numbers for months and saw huge numbers that weren't being brought to light or being dealt with. But in February Tim Geithner said the Fed was going to do those stress tests. I didn't know if they would fudge the numbers to make them look better than they were or if they'd tell it like it was so they could deal with the problems appropriately.

On May 7 the Fed released its results. In response I wrote:

# (BDO) May 7: We Agree!

The Stress Test numbers and ours are nearly the same!!! The regulators did an excellent job of explaining exactly what they did for this stress test and showing the numbers that produced the results. They did virtually exactly what we did since we started putting out our loss estimates nearly two years ago, and their numbers are essentially the same as ours. The differences between our numbers and theirs are more a matter of terminology than of substance. For example, the biggest difference between their estimates and ours is due to the number of years they and we are counting—i.e., their loss estimate is for the losses that will occur over the next two years and ours is for the total amount of losses that will be taken on these assets over the lives of these assets. As there will be losses in years 3, 4, etc., in addition to those in the first two years, naturally the total losses (i.e., ours) will be greater than the losses incurred over the next two years (i.e., theirs). We won't conjecture why they did it that way, though we do know from our projections that the maximum capital needs (i.e., when earnings fall short relative to losses) is probably at the end of two years. Anyway, that accounts for most of the difference in our total loss estimates, and in addition we may also have a slightly worse economic scenario than they do. Once these adjustments are made, we see essentially the same picture. What a relief!!! For the first time in the last two years we are confident that the regulators really do understand the scale of the banking problem!

Tim Geithner, who read *Bridgewater Daily Observations* daily throughout the crisis, took this one to President Obama. In his memoir, he described the moment as follows:

"The next morning, I walked into the Oval Office for the President's daily economics briefing with a report from Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund firm. Many experts, including Larry, regarded Bridgewater's Daily Observations as among the smartest and most credible sources of private-sector economic analysis—and among the darkest about the banks. In front of the economic team and the President's political advisers, I handed that day's Observations to the President…

I wasn't dancing in the end zone, but that was a good day for the home team.[60]

We were in sync about what was and what needed to be done about it. What a relief!

# The Beginning of the Beautiful Deleveraging: June-December 2009:

In the second half of 2009, the policies (i.e., providing liquidity via QE, capital via fiscal policies, and other supports via macro-prudential policies) reduced risks and increased the buying and prices of "riskier" assets, and the economy began to recover. This shift was analogous to others that produced "beautiful deleveragings" for reasons explained earlier.

While we won't discuss all the improving news of this period in depth, we will highlight two points. First, frequent concerns over inflation stemming from the fast pace of central bank printing didn't materialize, which fortunately laid to rest the incorrect belief that printing a lot of money would cause inflation to accelerate. The Fed's "printing money" would not cause an acceleration of inflation if it was replacing contracting credit.

As we explained to our clients that summer:

- Reflations don't necessarily cause inflation because they can simply negate deflations, depending on how far they are taken and what the money goes to.
- It is overly simplistic to talk about "inflation" because "inflation" is an average of many things that behave differently from one another. For example, when an economy is depressed, during reflations (which is normally the case, because otherwise there's no need for reflations), there is little or no inflation in labor costs and assets that are used for

-Associated Press production (e.g., real estate, equipment, etc.), while there is inflation in assets that benefit from decreases in the value of money/currency (e.g., internationally traded commodities, gold, etc.).

Second, Congress and the Obama administration shifted their attentionsto significantly increasing financial industry regulation and oversight. The following timeline gives a sense of how quickly these new laws and regulations were being written:

June 17: Obama delivers a speech outlining a legislative proposal for comprehensive financial services reform, which eventually led to the passing of Dodd-Frank. The proposal included heightened regulation, consolidation of existing regulatory bodies (with greater regulatory authority given to the Fed), more consumer protections, more regulation of credit rating agencies, and updated rules around winding down banks, among many other components. The bill itself wouldn't be passed until 2010.

June 24: The SEC suggested regulations for money market funds that would require them to hold some portion of their portfolios in highly liquid investments. Additionally, the proposed regulations would restrict money market funds' holdings to high-quality securities.

June 30: The Treasury Department released a bill to Congress to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency. The agency would take control of all consumer protection programs currently run by the Fed, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, FDIC, FTC, and the National Credit Union Administration.

July 23: The Federal Reserve proposed changes to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending). The changes aimed to improve the consumer disclosure laws for closed-end mortgages and home-equity credit. It would require APR and monthly payments (on adjustable-rate loans) to be communicated to the buyer.

October 22: The Fed proposed a review of 28 banking organizations' incentive compensation policies, to see whether or not they are "risk-appropriate," and to go through a similar process at smaller banks. This proposal came on the same day that the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation released[61] the determinations for executive compensation for the "top 25 most highly paid at the seven firms receiving exceptional assistance."

December 11: The House passed the creation of the Financial Stability Council and Consumer Financial Protection Agency.

Changing laws in ways that would have made the crisis less bad are typical at the end of big debt crises. Then, over long time frames (e.g., 25 years), as the hangover wears off and a new euphoria sets in, these laws are increasingly flouted and new forms of leverage are produced by new forms of entities, leading to a new debt crisis that evolves similarly.

# 2010 through Mid-2011

As 2010 began, the financial markets were strong (up nearly 65 percent from their March 2009 lows) because they were flush with liquidity thanks to the Fed's QE, and they were safer due to fiscal and regulatory changes. But the economy labored because many borrowers were weaker and more cautious, and lending standards had tightened.

Now, the markets started to discount a move to normalcy. The credit markets priced in that the Fed would tighten two or three times within the year—roughly the amount of tightening you'd expect in a standard business-cycle recovery from a recession. That was odd given conditions. Unemployment rates were still a hair away from post-war highs, wage growth was stuck, homes prices were flat at well-below the prior peak (meaning many middle-class mortgage borrowers remained underwater), credit standards were tightened, and borrowers who were still okay financially remained disinclined to lever up, while those who were inclined to lever up were financially dead. It was hard to imagine there would be a normal pickup.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-06/9328bd35-1a8f-4849-b68e-a73f4551b5ba/8026f6b78814475260c06a08d9b82400ec5e9f3a9d342971abf88216dd1f82f5.jpg)

Around this time, most of the world's central banks and governments were slowing their aggressive rates of stimulus. The Fed ended the first round of quantitative easing in March after purchasing 1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. The pace of fiscal stimulus from programs like the America Recovery and Reinvestment Act were set to peak later in the year. Abroad, there were pockets of tightening as countries like China increased interest rates.

Importantly, at this point it wasn't clear to investors that merely slowing or ending quantitative easing was equivalent to tightening—and not that different from raising interest rates. Some thought it was enough to simply pump a lot of money into the economy to stimulate it—and the Fed had certainly done that, printing over 2 trillion. But the flow of money was more important than the amount of money, as it was this flow of asset purchases that helped sustain their increases in value and the growth of lending to buyers in the economy, because credit growth remained slow. Yet the Fed's amount of stimulation was then popularly believed to be too much and irresponsible. We had a different view, doubting that developed economies would tighten as fast as what others thought and had priced in. We laid it out in the *Daily Observations* of February 17:

Monetization should not be viewed like a light switch that works in an all-or-none sort of way; it should be viewed like a spigot that regulates the flow in degrees. It works similar to interest rate cuts or putting your foot on the accelerator of a car. When doing either, you judge the right amount primarily by watching the reactions. When things start to pick up, you start to let off. When things start to slow down, you start to press the pedal harder. The same is true for monetizations. In our view, it is time for the Fed to put its foot back down on the monetization accelerator."

# (BDO) February 17: The Coming Tightening

It is now the established view among the electorate, central bankers, and elected officials that central banks printing and buying of financial assets and central governments budget deficits must be reined in because these actions are financially irresponsible. We think that this universally accepted view is at best premature and at worst dangerous…When we take a sharp pencil to these plans and their implications, we conclude that it is too much restraint—unless there is either major pickup in private debt growth or a major realignment of developed and emerging country currencies, both of which appear unlikely to happen in the amounts required.

At the same time, we did our pro forma financial projections in Europe and saw a debt crisis brewing there due to a mismatch between: a) the amount of borrowing debtors needed to rollover maturing debt and sustain what they were doing, and b) the amount of lending that would be required to come from banks that had already stretched their balance sheets. In February, several of Europe's more indebted countries—Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and especially Greece—struggled to meet their debt obligations and were facing deteriorating economic conditions. While the news flow associated with this led to some day-to-day volatility in global markets, most assessed the issue to be contained to Greece (and potentially Portugal) and that it would not pose larger problems for the European monetary system or the global economy. In a note to clients in early February, we calculated that the problem would probably be much worse:

# (BDO) February 4: Tightening + Over-indebtedness = High Risk

"We judge the over-indebtedness problems of the European debtor countries (PIGS) to be comparable in magnitude to some of the worst emerging-market debt problems of the past.

But the European debt crisis is a different story. While I won't go into it now, it is noteworthy that the same sequence of events followed, in that policy makers didn't believe they would face a debt crisis until they had it. When it came, they made the same rookie mistakes of leaning too heavily on deflationary levers like austerity and of not printing money and of not providing protections against defaults for systemically important entities until the pain became intolerable.

From May until July, the US equity market, which had rallied nearly 10 percent from the start of the year through late April, fell over 15 percent, largely on contagion worries about Europe and softness in the US economic numbers.

That weakness led to the realization that the Fed was likely to maintain its course on its 0-percent-interest-rate policy. US bond yields fell over 100 basis points over the next four months. The pace of improvement in the economy slowed in the summer of 2010. Timely reads on labor market health showed only modest improvement in unemployment claims, while the unemployment rate was still near highs. There was still a lot of slack in the economy. Weakness at this level of economic activity would have been terrible.

Bernanke addressed further QE in a speech in Jackson Hole, making it clear that it was a key policy option if needed, saying, "a first option for providing additional monetary accommodation, if necessary, is to expand the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities."[62] He also emphasized his belief that QE had been effective and had "made an important contribution to the economic stabilization and recovery." As the chart below shows, the 10-year break-even inflation rate had fallen by 50 basis points in the several months leading up to Bernanke's August speech, reflecting concerns of sustained very low inflation or deflation. However, after he signaled that further QE was a strong possibility, the markets rebounded strongly. The real economy response naturally lagged the essentially instantaneous market response, but it wasn't long before growth picked up as well.

In early October 2010, New York Fed President Bill Dudley described economic conditions as "wholly unsatisfactory" and argued that "further action is likely to be warranted."[63] Dudley went on to give an assessment of the underlying drivers of US growth that was broadly similar to our own view at the time, based largely on this observation (from our October 1 BDO): "Consumers are facing slow

It is against that backdrop that the ECB is 'normalizing' its balance sheet (both by letting its longer-term lending facilities roll off and by decreasing the pace of its asset purchases), and as a result pushing up both short-term interest rates and the euro. This de facto tightening of monetary policy seems like a mistake to us, and we suspect will cause conditions to deteriorate (likely further pressuring peripheral credits) and eventually cause the ECB to reverse course (pushing down rates and probably the euro)."

As a result, households have not responded to lower rates by saving less or borrowing." On October 6, I wrote the following:

# (BDO) October 6: The Next Shoe to Drop: More QE and Devaluations

What is happening is all very classic. Though they're all different, in most ways deleveragings are basically the same and transpire via a similar sequence of events. As we have described them in the *Daily Observations* and in our "Template for Understanding What's Going On," we won't dwell on this sequence, but will remind you of a few things that we think are especially relevant now.

All deleveragings are due to declines in private sector credit growth that require increases in both central bank money creation and central government deficits in order to offset the effects of the decline in private sector credit. Though many of us are financially conservative and feel that there is something unethical about printing money to bail out debtors and creditors, it is important to recognize that austerity to deal with debt-deleveraging problems has never worked when these problems were big. When austerity has been tried, even in persistent attempts to get out of debt, it has eventually been abandoned by all governments because it didn't work, and it was too painful. That is because the decreased borrowing and spending (and consequences of these on employment and many other pain points) make this type of deleveraging as self-reinforcing on the downside as the increased debts and spending that cause bubbles is on the upside. As a result, all of the deleveragings that we have studied (which is most of those that occurred over the last couple of hundred years) eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks).

The QE broadly worked in providing additional needed stimulus. Despite continued debt problems in Europe, the US economy and markets finished 2010 on a high note. Growth picked up after a brief lull between QE1 and QE2, the S&P 500 had 13 percent total returns for 2010, and inflation expectations had been re-anchored by the Fed's proven determination to continue stimulating as long as necessary. On March 15 of 2011, this is how we saw domestic conditions as they developed:

# (BDO) March 15: Transitioning Beyond the "Sweet Spot"

As previously mentioned, it is pretty clear that the US economy is going through a post-contraction growth spurt that is being supported by monetary policy, fiscal policy and an improvement in credit growth. As this recovery is occurring with both a) considerable slack domestically (and in Europe and Japan) and b) overheating demand in emerging countries, we see limited inflation pressures, with those pressures that exist largely coming via the prices of items that are being demanded by emerging countries. Said differently, 2010/2011 in a cyclical context appears quite like the "sweet spot" part of the cycle that typically occurs during the first two years of a recovery, when there remains adequate slack and low inflation pressures. However, this recovery from a contraction is taking place during a deleveraging and therefore has been more dependent on the Fed's printing of money and the central government's fiscal stimulus.

By this point, it was clear that the governments different programs to support the financial system broadly worked. Compared to other countries, the US financial system experienced:

- A relatively fast speed at which the financial system was recapitalized (and that TARP capital was repaid)
A relatively fast speed at which they unwound emergency credit programs
Good overall financial returns on the rescue across the various programs.

We will end this case study here, because in the second quarter of 2011 real GDP returned to its pre-crisis levels. This wasn't the end of the recovery by any means. There was still plenty of slack in the economy and a self-reinforcing upward cycle. The charts below show the unemployment rate, GDP growth, the GDP gap (showing the estimated amount of slack in the economy's capacity to produce), and the S&P 500 stock market index from 2006 until the writing of this on the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Lehman debt crisis. The shaded bars show where they were in 2Q 2011. The second set of charts show existing and projected debt-to-GDP ratios from 1920 until 10 years from now. These numbers do not include non-debt obligations such as those for pensions and health care, which are considerably larger than debts. But that's another issue to be explained at another time.
