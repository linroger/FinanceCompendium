## How to Use This Split

1. **Start with Part 1** to understand the theoretical framework and archetypal patterns
2. **Study Part 2** for deep, narrative understanding of three representative crises
3. **Reference Part 3** to see pattern repetition across 48 historical cases

## Key Insights from the Book

### The Archetypal Pattern

All debt crises follow a similar pattern:

1. Debt grows faster than income during the bubble
2. Can't service debt → defaults/restructuring
3. Central bank cuts rates to zero (not enough)
4. Need to pull all four levers: austerity, defaults, money printing, wealth transfers

### Beautiful Deleveraging

Optimal balance of the four policy levers that produces:

- Debt/GDP declining
- Acceptable economic growth
- Acceptable inflation
- Social/political stability

### Deflationary vs. Inflationary Depressions
- **Deflationary**: Domestic currency debt, central bank can print money
- **Inflationary**: Foreign currency debt, can't print foreign currency, currency collapse

**Study Recommendation**: Read all three parts to gain Dalio's complete mental model for understanding and navigating debt crises.
