# Why We Care About Financial Crises: Silicon Valley Bank

## Lecture 1

Thomas S. Coleman

March 20th, Draft March 19,2023

## Why A Course On "History Of Financial Crises"?

First, this is fun - wonderful stories full of human drama

- Isaac Newton, spring 1720: "I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people." Then went on to lose £20,000 - roughly £2.6mn today
- Banker, August 1720: "When the rest of the world are mad, we must imitate them in some measure." and Charles Prince (2008): "You have to keep dancing as long as the music is playing."
- 1866: "terror reigned in the City, the banks were besieged, consols went down to 84,"
Second, panics happen and we need to learn from history
- Currently in the middle of a banking crisis (Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse)
Third, valuable "experiments" to learn about economics
- Panics & crises usually related to debt, money, banks
- Crises teach us the fundamentals of money & banking

## Isaac Newton

p 38 & fn 32. Story about Isaac Newton selling April 20th 1720, profit of £7,000. Then in summer buying and losing £20,000.

"In the spring of 1720, he [Newton] stated: 'I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.' On April 20, accordingly, he sold out his shares in the South Sea Company at a solid 100 percent profit of £7,000. Unhappily, a further impulse later seized him, an infection from the mania gripping the world that spring and summer. He reentered the market at a top for a larger amount and ended up losing £20,000. In the irrational habit of many of us who experience disaster, he put it out of his mind, and never, for the rest of his life, could he bear to hear the name South Sea."

p 33 [?: quote re following the crowd

- "take the case of Martin, the banker who subscribed to £500 worth of South Sea stock in the third subscription list of August 1720, saying 'When the rest of the world are mad, we must imitate them in some measure.'"
- John Carswell, The South Sea Bubble [London: Cresset Press, 1960], p. 161
- Think about what Charles Prince (Citi) said in 2008: "You have to keep dancing as long as the music is playing."
"On May 10,1866, the great London discount house of Overend, Gurney & Co. had stopped payments; its liabilities were almost nineteen million pounds. The following day, England's Black Friday, 'terror reigned in the City, the banks were besieged, consols went down to 84,' reports Sir John Clapham, historian of the Bank of England."

- Kindleberger says preceding speculation was in Cotton, shipping in general.

## This Time Is Not Different

Shocking and disruptive they may be, but financial crises are not new or di erent or unusual The essence of the this-time-is-di erent syndrome is simple. It is rooted in the firmly held belief that financial crises are things that happen to other people in other countries at other times. (Reinhart&Rogo p 1)

Examine what happens to other people, at other times, in other countries

- What are financial crises? Banking? Sovereign debt default? Inflation?
- What are the causes of financial crises? Mania and irrationality? Monetary policy mistakes? Too much debt? Political structure?
- What does a financial crisis look like?
I. Financial and liquidity crises like 2008
II. Whenever one of these happens, we always say "this time is di erent"
(A) In the run-up to the crisis we say that the borrowing or the debt or the stock-market prices or whatever is not too much or too high, that it will not lead to a crisis like it did in 1999 or 1929 or whenever. Because the world is di erent now than it used to be.
1. And maybe this is true, because the world does change - electricity and cars in the 1920s fundamentally changed the world and made everyone richer and better-o. Everyone, both the wealthy in the wealthy nations and the poor in the poor nations. We are immensely richer and better o today than in 1900 - Things like life expectancy have increased immensely - in 1910 the average life expectancy (across the world) was only 33 years. By 1992 it rose to 61 years and is even higher today. (Bourgignon & Morrison table 1). And the internet changed our world in the 1990s and continues to do so.
(B) In the aftermath, during the crisis itself, we always say "this time is di erent", that it has never happened before. That this crisis is uniquely disastrous and unlike anything that has happened before.
2. Because, for most of us, it is disastrous and unique - we have never lived through a crisis like this.
III. My primary purpose in this course is to convince you that, new and exciting as the boom is and shocking and disruptive as the crisis, such events are not new nor di erent - we have seen this all before.
The essence of the this-time-is-di erent syndrome is simple. It is rooted in the firmly held belief that financial crises are things that happen to other people in other countries at other times. (Reinhart & Rogoff p 1)
IV. I want to examine what it is that happens to other people, at other times, in other countries
(A) What are financial crises? Banking failures? Sovereign debt default? Inflation?
(B) What are the causes of financial crises? Mania and irrationality? Monetary policy mistakes? Too much debt? Political structure?
(C) What happens during a financial crisis?

Banking failures - one definition of a "crisis"

- "between 1930 and 1933 more than 9,100 banks (38 percent of all banks) suspended operations."
(US) Regulatory e ects often follow
US Federal Reserve founded in 1913 in response to 1907-08 crisis
- Glass-Steagall and FDIC deposit insurance in the 1930s
Dodd-Frank after the 2008 crisis
Debt - usually big increases
US debt as $\%$ of GDP went from about $58\%$ in 2007 to $100\%$ in 2015
- Reinhart & Rogo argue that high government debt has long-lasting e ccts
I. Large and long-lasting e ects.
(A) Output and employment e cts - much larger recessions than non-crisis recessions. For example for 1870-1929 the average per-capita output for liquidity crises (4 crises) was $-6.1\%$, for other recessions (11 other) $-0.9\%$. We will examine this in a problem set.
(B) Banking failures - many crises lead to bank failures. In fact this may be a defining characteristic - big changes in banking, liquidity, money, credit. For example in the US "between 1930 and 1933 more than 9,100 banks (38 percent of all banks) suspended operations." ([?] p 189)
(C) Regulatory e ccts - often the regulatory landscape changes dramatically after a financial crisis. The Federal Reserve system in the US was founded in 1913 primarily in response to the 1907-08 crisis and the suspension of convertibility. Glass-Steagall (separating commercial and investment banking) and FDIC deposit insurance came in after the bank failures of 1930-33. Dodd-Frank came in after the 2008 crisis and imposed substantial new regulations and increased the cost of regulation substantially.
(D) Debt - Reinhart & Rogo argue that government debt increases substantially and that this has long-lasting effects.
II. "Natural Experiments" - financial crises are extreme and, possibly, allow us to examine economic theories in ways we cannot during normal circumstances
III. Fun
(A) I have to admit that financial crises are just fun. They exhibit extreme behavior and produce wonderful stories
# 2.2 What We Study - Structure & Themes
# Contents
# Three Topics / Themes

I. Government Debt & Financial Market Modernization

- South Sea (London 1720), Mississippi Co. (Paris, 1720), US 1792
- Often presented as bubbles & irrational manias
- Fundamental forces - government borrowing and default - behind the panics
II. Money & Banking: Fragile US Banking & Crises 1870-2008
- What is "money"?
- Money, inflation & hyperinflation - German hyperinflation
- Inflation as "debt default" - stressed by Reinhart & Rogo
- But also an "inflation tax" that raises revenue when regular taxes cannot
- What is a "bank"?
- Liquidity provider, deposits, bank runs, deposit insurance
- Learn by studying US liquidity & banking crises, particularly 1893,1907,1930s
III. Theory Behind Banking Crisis
- Calomiris & Haber: Financial system structure & property rights
- Mortgage crises of 2008: Gov't & Policy decisions and mis-pricing risk
Modules / Topics for this course:
I. Government Debt and Financial Market Modernization - Plus some Central Bank policy issues
- Examine four episodes of financial crisis
- Development of Government Debt: South Sea (London 1720), Mississippi Co. (Paris, 1720), US 1792
- Sovereign & Emerging Market debt: Barings Crisis of 1890
Often presented as irrational bubbles, manias, frauds.
- Mackay ([?]), Kindleberger ([?,?,??), Economist ([?])
- They were. But there is more, much more, to the story.
- In these three instances it involved building gov't debt markets and restructuring gov't debt. For US (1792), London (1720) the e ort was successful. For Paris (1720) it was not terribly successful. France defaulted??
- The US in 1792 was particularly extraordinary. In a few short years (roughly 1789-1793) the US built modern financial system. Only the Dutch (roughly 200 years earlier) and Britain (roughly 70 years earlier) had managed this transformation. France failed in
1720. Central Bank policy - "Lender of Last Resort"
	- Central Bank policy during financial (liquidity crisis) - Bagehot's rules ([?] Chapter 7, paragraphs 57-58) but actually articulated & implemented by Hamilton 80 years earlier (1792)
II. Money & Banking - US Banking Crises 19th & 20th c
	- Learn about "what is money" and "what is a bank" by examining the crises, focusing specifically on US crises
	- Very regular and serious: 1814,1819,1837-39,1857,1873,1893,1907,1929-33,1982-87,2008
	- Unit banking and US perverse banking laws as the underlying cause for the fragile US banking system of the 19th and first-half 20th c - [?] chapter 6
	- The US from 1840-2008 had 13 systemic banking crises (with multiple bank failures, suspension, or other serious disruption). Canada none. What made these two countries so direent?
	- Deposit Insurance ([?,?])
	- Part of "Money": Inflation & Hyperinflation
	- Inflation as "debt default"
Another way that governments default on their debt
Stressed by Reinhart & Rogo
	- True but we also want to think about the "inflation tax" that raises revenue when regular taxes cannot
The classic paper by Cagan on German (and other) hyperinflations
	- Germany.
"Tabloid" narrative: [?,?] chapters 7,10.
The Alternate or Analytical story: [?]
	- World inflation: [?] section on inflation and default by inflation
III. Theory for Banking crises: financial system rules, property rights, and Calomiris & Haber's Fragile by Design
US Banking 1840-1980:
	- State-limited and unit banking - creating ine cient of fragmented, small, fragile banks
	- rural populist / small bank coalition
	- How and why this leads to recurrent banking and liquidity crises unit or state-level banks do not have the scale and cost structure to diversify risks across different regions and types customers, or a large-enough customer base to weather withdrawal shocks
	- Various methods have been tried to shore up an inherently fragile system – deposit insurance (schemes from before 1860, the 1910s-1920s (that failed) and nation-wide from the 1930s).
Regulation. None of these worked very well.
	- Compare US (fragmented system) with Canada (federal system)
	- From about 1830-1980s banking e ectively controlled at state level
	- Most banks no branches
In 1914 - 27,349 banks in US, $95\%$ no branches
US di erent from rest of world
Only country with this kind of unit banking structure. Eg Canada: 38 banks in 1890,22 in 1922
Only country experiencing recurring panics by end of 19th c (next slide)
1840-present: US 12 crises, Canada none
	- Mortgage-backed crises 2008
	- [?] chapter 7 & 8
	- The argument that the crisis was the result of risk being mis-prices, as a result of a combination of self-interested coalition between bankers and (well-meaning) urban activists together with government policy to widen credit availability and raise homeownership.
Mexico??
·[?]
Narrative ("Tabloid") vs Analytic Views For financial crises, there tend to be two alternate views:
I. Standard Narrative ("Tabloid") Approach:
	- What happened - the "tabloid" version
	- Crisis, panic, mania, crash
	- Fun but not very informative
II. Alternate ("Analytical") Approach:
	- What is going on behind or underneath
	- Underlying economic forces, political and institutional structure that shape the crises
	- Using crises to teach us about debt, money, banking
Two views:
I. Standard or "tabloid" version
	- I call this the "tabloid" version because
(A) It tells the story of what happened, it reports the events & people
(B) It is fun
	- Unfair to call this the "tabloid" version because it is, in itself, immensely useful. It shows us that we as people and social beings, can be infinitely foolish, gullible, greedy, stupid. And it shows that this kind of thing can happen, again and again
	- But it often misses important economic forces the lie beneath the surface story
# Ii. Alternate Version
- Again, unfair to call this an "alternate" version because it really is a supplement or expansion of the tabloid version
- But it is incredibly valuable in teaching us deeper issues about economics and human behavior.
# Alternate Leads To Deep Issues

To understand the alternate view we need to dig into many issues

Government debt markets:

- How did they work then vs now? How has debt built democracy?
Money & liquidity
- What is money? What is liquidity demand?
- How to manage a liquidity crisis
Banking & bank runs
- How do banks work? What are bank runs?
- Deposit insurance: solution or subsidy?
Inflation & hyperinflation
- What is inflation? What causes inflation?
- Inflation for default or tax?
To understand the alternate view we need to dig into many issues
Government debt markets:
- How did they work then vs now?
- How debt has built democracy – Macdonald's argument in "Free Nation" that debt allowed indebted nations to win wars. Compare Britain & France financial positions 1788 and borrowing capacity [?] p 241
- Money & banking - money and liquidity
- What is money? Use David's slides?
- What is liquidity and what is liquidity demand?
- What happens during a liquidity crisis? Demand for money goes up so either supply of money has to go up or price of money goes down.
- How to solve a liquidity crisis - inject liquidity and increase supply to match the demand.
- Money & banking - bank runs
- Runs as a bank liquid asset problem
- "Large sample" solution - large banks
- Deposit insurance solution - Calomiris's arguments about whether it is a run solution or small-bank subsidy
Inflation & hyperinflation
- What is inflation? What causes inflation? (increases in money)
- Inflation as default vs tax
# 3 Silicon Valley Bank Crisis

Silicon Valley Bank - Classic Bank Crisis

We are in the middle of a classic banking crisis

- This is absolutely wonderful – for this course but not for the world
Today (and Wednesday) I am going to spend some time talking about SVB
- Also two others in the news - First Republic and Credit Suisse
These three are very di erent
SVB
- Solvency problems that led to liquidity problems (bank run)
First Republic
- Lost money but still looks solvent
- But depositors worried, created liquidity problem
Credit Suisse
- Poorly managed for many years - just not a very good company (maybe my biased opinion)
What is Solvency? Liquidity? What is a Bank?
We have lot to unpack here
- What is Solvency? What is Liquidity?
- Even more basic, What is a Bank?
Like many things in our world, the underlying ideas are very simple
- But only simple after we have learned a lot of background
Many details that can distract us
Mark-to-Market and Held-to-Maturity vs Available-for-Sale portfolio
Capital ratios, deposits, bonds
But let's turn to the basic question: "What is a Bank?"
# 4 What Is A Bank?
# Contents
# Bank As Lender & Money Creator

Two main purposes or activities of a bank:

I. Business like any company: raises funds and invests

- All companies raise funds by issuing equity (from shareholders) and debt
(borrowing) - The company then uses those funds to run a business
- Apple builds computers and smartphones. A bank makes loans, provides banking services (credit cards, ATMs), and invests
II. Creating money
(liquidity) - Money is complicated, and later we will spend some time on money
- For now, take my word that banks "create" something we use for day-to-day transactions
Look at a simple balance sheet and we can see both of these things going on:
# Bank Balance Sheet: Business & "Money" Creation

Look for two activities in Apple Balance Sheet (Business and Money)

Assets: for making business profits.

- "Current" = cash + recievables. "Other" = patents, etc.?
Liabilities: where the funds come from.
- Debt - Short-term & Long-term
Equity - from shareholders
Silicon Valley Bank
Assets are Loans or Investments
Loans: Traditional bank business
- Investments: buying bonds (to earn profit)
Liabilities: where funds come from
- Mostly Deposits - loans from customers
- Some Other (bonds issued by bank)
Equity - from shareholders

Other & 13.1 & 16.3 & Equity \\ \hline
Total & 211.8 & 211.8 & Total \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

We can look in a simple bank balance sheet to see the two activities.

- The loan business is easy to see on the asset side - lending to business or individuals and charging a rate that's higher than the interest paid on the liability side.
- The money business is in the banknotes / deposits.
- When this works we can use the deposits as money – they are generally accepted by other people easily and quickly.
# 4.1 What Are Deposits? What Is Money?
# Contents
# To Understand Deposits – Think About Money

What is money? One of the hardest questions in economics

- Start with currency - pieces of paper printed by the government
- Example: Zimbabwe 20-dollar bill
- No photo of US $ - not legal
-Zimbabwe fun-2nd worst inflation ever
- Anyone my age has used currency
- Worked pretty well as money for many years
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/c098d702853208b8cbc8ce96d422c566e85882ce03fd4a0df6fa41f49bb89508.jpg)
# Currency Is (Or Was) Pretty Good As Money

A piece of paper printed by the government

- Payments: very fast and easy - in 1920s when many transactions face-to-face. (Less now with buying and selling electronically)
- Keeps value: lasts pretty well, does not "melt" like ice
- Unit of account: need to think about this
- Liquid: easy to buy / sell
- Pretty good as "money" for many years
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/ba82f61299056e833c55f5f1dc6c1b86cd1224faca0720824710709e903e9f53.jpg)
# More Money - Demand Deposits
- Currency good for face-to-face - not as good for distant and electronic transactions
- Need something that can be easily stored and transferred electronically
- In the late 1800s, banks (at least in US) started issuing demand deposits
- A special type of security, a loan to a bank,
- Bank promises to pay back on demand and at par (1\$ for every 1\$ loaned)
- Special kind of loan, two special characteristics
I. Promise to pay back on demand & at par - $1-per-$1
II. Upon default, pay first-come - first-served
- If you're late, you get nothing
- Strong incentive to get first in line - Bank Runs
- Very different than other loans
(bonds) - Regular bond-holders, upon default, get pro-rata share (assets divided according to payment hierarchy)
- Works nicely as money
- Transfer from one bank to another
- Originally by paper check, now electronically
# Demand Deposits (Checking Account) - Loan To Bank

"Bank Deposits" are the checking account you and I use

- We think of it as "money" - we "put our money into the bank"
WRONG: it is a loan you and I make to the bank
- But a very special type of loan
(debt) Apple Computer (2022, $bn)
ST Debt: $< 1\mathrm{yr}$; LT: $>1\mathrm{yr}$
- Bonds or loans have a maturity
- When default, remaining assets shared among debtors
Silicon Valley Bank (2022, Sbn)
Deposit loans are day-by-day
- Can redeem at any time
- When default, first person in line gets \$100, last gets zero

With "Big Loss" SVB is barely solvent (almost insolvent or "in default")
- Insolvency
(default) means not enough assets to pay back debtors
- In this example, just barely solvent (assets just more than debts)
In this case debtors are
(mostly) depositors

Now in a very delicate position, with both Solvency Risks and Liquidity Risks Solvency Risk
Depositors worried investments may go down more
- Regular debts (like for Apple) cannot withdraw early
- Deposits can, and rational to do so
- Get out now, before things get worse
# Liquidity Risk
Even if knew for sure assets would not go down
- Assets may be illiquid - take a few months or year to sell o
- Depositors may need money back sooner
Rational to get first in line, take money out now
In either case, depositors will likely withdraw and the bank will likely fail
- Bank will not have enough liquid assets
(cash) to pay depositors
# Fundamental Issue: Banking Inherently Unstable
- The fact that deposits can be redeemed at any time makes banks inherently unstable
Here are some things which can reduce some of the risks:
I. Solvency: Be extremely transparent and up-to-date in value of assets (so everyone has confidence that the balance sheet numbers are reliable)
II. Solvency: Carefully manage the interest rate risk (duration mismatch) and the credit risk of assets
III. Liquidity: Hold liquid assets (easily and quickly sold). If depositors ask for their funds, assets can be quickly sold.
IV. Deposits: Find deposits that are more "sticky" - depositors who are not likely to move their money quickly
# 5 Svb And The Past Few Years
# Contents
# Examine What Happened Over Past Few Years
I. Solvency: Transparent and up-to-date value of assets
II. Solvency: Manage interest rate
(duration) risk (and credit risk)
III. Liquidity: Hold liquid assets
IV. Deposits: Find "sticky" deposits
SVB did more-or-less the opposite - it was hard to get the true numbers behind the published balance sheet
- Delving a little into details about banking & accounting
- Most bankers like to put assets into Held-to-Maturity portfolio
- Claim that they will hold until maturity, so can report (on balance sheet) at original cost
- Horrible, dangerous idea, but bankers (and regulators) do not like or trust market prices and mark-to-market
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/863ab192cfe064e3f5530887ae01af90aabee4f9f6c9ee6c46d1532a44e3560d.jpg)
SVB held a high percentage of assets as Held-to-Maturity investments, and SVB stands out as above average. I cannot see true value of assets
SVB
(apparently) did a horrible job at this
- The Economist pointed out they bought long-dated US Treasury (and mortgage) bonds as deposits grew (in 2018,2019,2020)
- Bought bonds when rates were low (and prices high)
- In 2021 and 2022, interest rates soared, and bond prices fell
- SVB apparently did not manage
(hedge) that risk
Together with HtM of problem (1), means SVB lost money but nobody could easily see (until March 8)
- They eventually had to sell all of their non-HtM portfolio (called Available for Sale assets) and lost \$1.8bn. No doubt more losses in the HtM portfolio
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/52afed874e52f8be1dda13fe28184475ee1adb71289c2915d630441183a4e7b0.jpg)
# My Conclusion: Svb Made Mistakes, But Did Many Things Right
SVB did many things right.
- Little speculative or risky loans or investments
- Very di erent from 2008 mortgage crises, where banks loaded up on worthless mortgages
- SVB invested in US Treasuries and high-quality mortgage bonds
# Let Me Be Very Clear: Svb Made Mistakes. Mistakes That Led To Failure
- Asset-liability
(duration) mismatch: borrowed short-term
(deposits) , invested long-term
(bonds) - Classic banking activity, but always risky and needs to be well-managed
- SVB managed poorly
- Poor reporting and accounting
- Large Held-to-Maturity portfolio that obscured underlying asset-liability
(duration) mismatch
# This Is Basic, Simple, Banking-101 - And Svb Got It Wrong
- Looks like SVB messed up the old-fashioned way, not through anything unethical or nefarious
# Examine More Closely Svb Losses On Assets
Picture (from NYTimes) shows gains & losses for both HtM and AfS portfolio
- Trying to capture true value of assets
- Losses as % of deposits - SVB up to 9%
- Look at the "Big Loss" below - I chose $9\%$ of deposits
- Close to true situation for SVB in 2022 - nearly insolvent
People did not realize until March 8
# When Run Started, Massive Loss Of Deposits.
- I've heard \$41bn left in a day or two
- Looking at balance sheet (\$173.1bn deposits) no way they could survive

Regarding the Reinhard & Rogo reading (Chapter 1 "Varieties of Crises", on Library reserve):
Of the crises defined by quantitative thresholds and those defined by historical events (in Reinhart & Rogo), select one to describe briefly in class. Is there a historical example of this type of crisis that you would like to explore further? Why?
From the Kindleberger readings (Chapters 2 & 3, on Library Reserve):
Name the five stages in Minsky's model (From Kindleberger). Minsky's model usually revolves around one country. Explain how a shock in a single country can impact other countries. Provide examples from the readings.
# 3 The Economist History Of Crises
# 3.1 Overview - 1792,1825,1857,1907,1930S
# Contents
# Economist - Five Crises & Institutional Outcomes
Five important crises. But for each, a deeper story than Economist tells
I. 1792: Bank of the United States
- Economist: Speculative bubble & crash in bonds and Bank of US stock. Led to NY Stock Exchange
- Deeper: US builds debt and banking markets - financial transformation
II. 1825: London, Emerging market bond defaults
- Economist: Bubble & crash in emerging market bonds
- Deeper: BoE monopoly and fragmented banking system produced systemic fragility
III. 1857: Global crisis and contagion
- Economist: Globalization, railroad stocks, and financial innovation
- Deeper: BoE "accommodation" encouraged risk-taking (moral hazard) and crises
IV. 1907: NY bank failures and emergency money
- Economist: Narrative of banking crisis & money. Birth of Federal Reserve
- Deeper: Fragile & fragmented banking system. Bank restrictions (cash suspension)
V. 1929: The Big One and bank failures
- Economist: Narrative of bank failures. Led to FDIC deposit insurance
- Deeper: Systemic fragility of fragmented banking system. Depression caused by the Fed. Alternate view of Deposit Insurance - subsidy for poorly-run banks
Fed "caused the Great Depression". Deposit insurance a subsidy for in cient banks
# 1792 And Bank Of Us
The Economist narrative for 1792, supplemented by $[\text{?}, \text{?}, \text{?}]$:
- Focuses on the first Bank of the United States
(BUS) - Only part of the story, and arguably not the most important part
- BUS shares
- \$10mn of BUS shares, \$8mn to the public.
 - Initially o ered July 4,1791. \$400/share, needed to buy \$25 share certificate or "scrip" - essentially option to pay additional \$375 for full share
 - Scrip prices went from \$25 in July to \$300 in August 1791
- Actually, two panics. Not highlighted by The Economist but pretty important
- Mini-panic or Bank Scrip Bubble, August
1791. Primarily in scrip, which went from $25 up to $270 or even \$300 by August
1792. Crashed back to \$130 by mid-August
The BUS direct public o ering led to six weeks of heated financial speculation, the likes of which had never before been witnessed in America. Bank scraps purchased at $25$ quickly doubled in price and remained at that level for most of July. In early August, they soared, reaching a bid of 264-280 asked in New York on August 11, and reportedly more than 300 in Philadelphia that same evening. Then they tumbled, in Boston from 230 on August 12 to 112 on August 14, to 154-59 in New York on August 16, and to 125-37 in Philadelphia the same day, before rallying later that month. $\left[\text{?}\right] p\ 71$
    - William Duer and "Company" - spring 1792, speculation in bonds (rather than BUS scrip).
A rather complicated plan to borrow money, launch a new bank in NY and drive down the price of of BONY and thus obtain control of BONY, and then corner the market for government bonds.
Traditionally, accounts of the bubble and crash of spring 1792 focus on William Duer, a New York speculator, well-connected businessman, erstwhile governmental cial in both the old and new governments, and personal friend of Hamilton. The scheming and operations of Duer and other members of his speculative "company" drove securities prices to new highs early in the year. In March, when Duer could not repay the large amounts of money he had borrowed to implement his plans, the market crashed and panic ensued. The scheming involved an attempt in January to launch a large new bank in New York City in order to drive down the price of BONY stock, which would allow Duer to obtain control of it. Then, Duer and his compatriots planned to corner the market for U. S. sixes, which subscribers to the BUS would need to meet their future payments for BUS shares. [?] p 73
# 1825: London And Emerging Markets
This is really fun because it sounds so modern - emerging markets (and Latin American bonds) have been defaulting for a couple centuries.
We will talk about Argentina and the Barings Crisis of 1890 in more detail
London became the center for foreign-government financing and bonds.
- 1820 one foreign bond in London. By 1826 there were
23. Russia, Prussia, Denmark
    - Between 1822-25, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Guatemala sold bonds worth gbp21mn (\$2.8bn today)
    - The Economist quotes a paper by Marc Flandreau (Geneva Graduate Institute) and Juan Flores (University of Geneva): by end-1825 Peru's bonds were trading at 40.
    - "The big problem with all this was distance". But not really true. Distance and communication-time was not a problem in the 1970s. Or 1997 (Asian crisis).
    - Banks exposed. By December 1825 bank runs
    - In 1826 more than $10\%$ of banks in England failed
But Calomiris & Haber talk about the fragility of London banking during this period. Banks hobbled in what they could do to compete with the BoE. Contrast this with Edinburgh. (Banks in London could not be joint-stock - limited to six partners.)
    - pp 112-113 C&H discuss the monopoly of the Bank of England and the fragmented and fragile nature of English banking:
Thus at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the English banking system consisted of the Bank of England, which did not branch beyond its headquarters on Threadneedle Street, the goldsmith banks in London (which were still constrained by the six-partner rule), and several hundred small country banks that were also subject to the six-partner rule.
Although this system provided increased access to credit in remote areas, it was inherently unstable as well as in-cient when compared to a system of large, nationwide banks. Small banks could not easily diversify their risks across geographic regions or across different types of borrowers; neither could bankers easily shift funds within the system in order to head off runs. ([?] p 112)
    - pp 114-115, they discuss the 1825 crisis.
The lack of available liquidity outside London during the crisis produced commercial insolvencies and bank failures on a spectacular scale. Seventy-three out of 770 country banks failed. Bankruptcy filings in 1826 reached an unprecedented level. The inherent vulnerability of the country's small banks was clearly demonstrated, as were the costs to the private sector of the absence of liquidity providers (large banks) that could have supported the smaller banks operating outside London. ([?] pp 114-115)
# 1857: Global Crisis & Contagion
Economist focus on financial innovation: Joint stock banks in London (now allowed) could o er customers BoE-1 on deposits. Discount houses could not pay customers (not called depositors but more-or-less the same) less than BoE-1, but could not charge borrowers more than BoE. (BoE also lent to businesses, so discount houses could not charge more for the best credits.)
But C&H and earlier paper by Calomiris & Schweikert (1991) argue that NY bank suspension was a result of mid-summer-1857 collapse in railroad stocks and Kansas land prices, and they argue that the fall was related to political issues re pro- and anti-slavery forces and the status of Kansas as a free or slave state. (cf p 816)
Ohio Life failed August 24th
1857. But according to Calomiris & Schweikert did not precipitate general suspension or failures (only one Ohio bank failed, and virtually none of Ohio Life's correspondent banks).
I think the deeper story here is that this was the last event of the 1825-1857 transformation of the English banking system, as the BoE gave up its monopoly and became the lender of last resort (and de-facto regulator) of the banking system. According to C&H, prior to the 1857 crisis the BoE was "accommodating" and provided liquidity when needed by discounting bills for discount houses and bill brokers. This built up a system that embedded moral hazard and encouraged banks and other financial intermediaries to be imprudent - the opposite of the post-1857 environment where "in an environment in which imprudent banks do not get rescued, it pays to be a prudent bank" [?, 123]
The ability of the BoE to provide liquidity during a crisis (by discounting bills) and to withhold from insolvent banks (which they demonstrated in 1866 with Overend & Gurney) provided both the liquidity mechanism and the disciplinary mechanism which then produced a stable banking system.
# 1907 Us Liquidity Crisis
The underlying story here is the fragmented and fragile banking system, in contrast to the English system that was in place after
1866. State-level chartering and unit banking laws resulting from the agrarian populist / small banker coalition guaranteed a financial system with period crises - 1893 preceded this and the 1920s and 1930s followed.
The Economist has a good narrative of the banking
Economist focuses on narrative of Trust Companies & "Emergency Money"
    - Bad recession May-Sept, but not disastrous
    - October: Knickerbocker, banking panic, and things got really bad
Knickerbocker - related to speculation in copper
Run-up seems an example of speculative mania
After e ect liquidity crisis and fragmented unit banking
    - NY Clearing House banks (and then others) restricted payments You could not convert your deposits into cash (could not cash a check)
    - Stock market plunged, JP Morgan organized \$25mn support, banking seized up
Small banks & liquidity shocks & bank runs
    - "Atomized, decentralized [banking] system"
    - Banks chartered by state: too small to spread risk of localized withdrawals In a unit banking system with some 20,000 independent banks, the impact was bound to be uneven, to force some banks into suspension, and to threaten a chain reaction involving a cumulative increase in the desire on the part of the public to convert deposits into currency. (F&S p 169)
Money supply couldn't expand
We will need to study:
Banking, runs, deposit insurance
    - Money, liquidity, liquidity demand

# 3.2 Some Points Re The Economist
# The Economist Is Good, Not Great
More the Narrative than the Analytical approach
- But it is a good narrative
- Forces us to start asking questions and dig deeper
The Economist is right in much of what they say:
Finance is one of the most important parts of our economy.
- Only we don't notice until it falls apart - like 1929 or 2008
Finance is not merely prone to crises, it is shaped by them.
- This is true, but the reverse is also true:
Financial crises are shaped by the financial and political environment.
The financial & political environment is the subject of this course
But we should be skeptical about "institutions that have enhanced people's lives"
- Federal Reserve "caused" the Great Depression in 1930s
- Deposit insurance is public subsidy to small, weak, in cient banks
Finance is not merely prone to crises, it is shaped by them. $\mathbb{P}?$
This is true, but the reverse is also true: "Financial crises are shaped by the financial and political environment."
The Economist talks about "institutions that enhance people's economic lives, such as central banks, deposit insurance...".
I want us to be a little skeptical about these institutions.
We will see instances where these institutions demonstrably have not "enhanced people's lives"
# Institutions That Enhance Our Lives - Central Banks
But we should be skeptical about "institutions that have enhanced people's lives"
- Federal Reserve "caused" the Great Depression in 1930s
- Deposit insurance is public subsidy to small, weak, in cient banks
# Bank Of England
- 18th and early 19th c Bank of England as an institution for raising funds - government provided monopoly benefits
- Arguable destabilized markets
Federal Reserve - not always good for economy
- pre-1913
(restriction) - didn't exist
1930s: Great Depression - Fed failure
2007-09 - liquidity provider - success
# Institutions
The Economist talks about "institutions that enhance people's economic lives, such as central banks, deposit insurance...".
I want us to be a little skeptical about these institutions.
We will see instances where these institutions demonstrably have not "enhanced people's lives"
Central Banks
- Bank of England: Calomiris & Haber argue that in the 18th and early part of the 19th century the British government used the Bank of England as an institution for raising funds and that the government provided valuable monopoly benefits to the BoE that actually constrained finance and led to a fragile financial system, subject to periodic crises.
One might hypothesize that England led the world into the Industrial Revolution in the late eighteenth century because bank credit was broadly available to its inventors and manufacturers. These inferences would be reasonable; but they would be wrong. The Bank of England was a monopoly set up to finance a government that spent more than it taxed and which was therefore willing to trade a set of lucrative privileges to a group of financiers in exchange for loans to the government. From 1694 to 1825, the Bank of England was the only bank in England that was allowed to take the form of a joint-stock company; all other banks had to be organized as partnerships and were limited in size. They were also subject to usury laws, which discouraged them from expanding their circle of borrowers: if a bank cannot charge a new client a higher interest rate to compensate for the fact it does not know much about him, it will not lend to that client at all. The government, which was not constrained by these usury laws, was therefore able to channel credit to itself rather than to the private sector. England industrialized not because manufacturers were awash in credit but rather in spite of the fact that the government had quite consciously constrained the growth of the banking system in order to favor itself and the Bank of England. The Industrial Revolution was financed out of the pockets of tinkerers and manufacturers, not through bank lending. (P.) pp 84-85)
To modern readers, the "loans for rents" arrangements may smack of corruption and cronyism. Indeed, Bank of England o cials routinely paid bonuses to treasury o cial to express their appreciation for their special business relationship. These arrangements did, however, have a clear bottom-line benefit to the state: England, unlike Holland and France, was able to avoid defaulting on its debts in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In consequence, the British government was able to borrow much more than its rivals, and at lower rates of interest, and therefore vanquish them on the seas and battlefields. (?) p 93)
- This is an example of the "Game of Bank Bargains" – the idea that states & banks arrange implicit bargains because states need banks for raising funds and banks need states to set the institutional structure and enforce contracts – that Calomiris & Haber discuss and that we will examine later in the course.
- Calomiris & Haber contrast London banking – fragile, limited, poor credit provision – with Scotland – stable, ample credit. They argue that there was not a superpower government looking for funding and so the Scottish political system did not need to provide monopoly benefits to banks in return for funding the government.
- Federal Reserve, 1930s: we will spend a week on the Federal Reserve and the Great Depression. There were 3 phases that we will examine:
- Pre-1913: No Federal Reserve, was characterized by financial crises where private banks got together and suspended convertibility. We will look at 1893-94,1907-08; but earlier episodes (I think also suspension in 1870s? 1857?)
- 1929-33: With Federal Reserve (founded 1913). They botched it. As Ben Bernanke said in 2002:
Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an o cial representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again. (Ben Bernanke, 2002 at Milton's Friedman's birthday celebration at Ida Noyes)
- 2007-2008: Federal Reserve saved the day, provided reserves and I think we can say they saved the financial system
# Institutions That Enhance Our Lives - Deposit Insurance
# Deposit Insurance
- We will read and debate about whether deposit insurance stabilizes or destabilizes the banking system
- Economic purpose: to forestall bank runs, reduce systemic risk
- What is a bank run?
In a unit banking system with some 20,000 independent banks, the impact was bound to be uneven, to force some banks into suspension, and to threaten a chain reaction involving a cumulative increase in the desire on the part of the public to convert deposits into currency. (F&S p 169)
# Deposit Insurance - Solution Or Subsidy
Calomiris & Jaremski argue that deposit insurance more often serves private interests:
Economic theories posit that bank liability insurance is designed as serving the public interest... Political theories see liability insurance as serving the private interests of banks, bank borrowers, and depositors, potentially at the expense of the public interest. Empirical evidence... supports the private-interest approach as liability insurance generally has been associated with increases, rather than decreases, in systemic risk. (Calomiris & Jaremski, abstract)
- Deposit Insurance: goal is to provide back-up to fragile banks that are subject to runs on deposits.
- What is a run? A bank takes in "deposits" – money from depositors – then uses that money for its business of lending. Basically when you and I put money into a checking account we lend money to the bank. We have the right to get the money back at any time – we can redeem the loan any time. The bank will hold some ready cash in their vault to be able to pay back the small number of people on any day who want some of their cash. But banks will generally hold only a fraction – say \$1 in cash for every \$10 in deposits. Now, if everyone wanted their money back on the same day the bank could not pay it all back. Well, if people start to get nervous and think others might ask for their money, they may try to get there first and that is a run: everyone suddenly wants their money back.
- Deposit insurance is a way to spread the risk – the government (or somebody) promises to pay depositors if a bank gets into trouble, so suddenly the motivation for a run disappears.
- Calomiris & Jaremski (which we will read) challenge this idea:
Economic theories posit that bank liability insurance is designed as serving the public interest by mitigating systemic risk in the banking system through liquidity risk reduction. Political theories see liability insurance as serving the private interests of banks, bank borrowers, and depositors, potentially at the expense of the public interest. Empirical evidence - both historical and contemporary - supports the private-interest approach as liability insurance generally has been associated with increases, rather than decreases, in systemic risk. (Calomiris & Jaremski, abstract)
# Crises As Catalyst For Change
Crisis may sometimes entrench public backing
But not always
The only time you can get major change is when there is a crisis.
(Friedman) Milton Friedman said that countries confront problems only after they have become crises
(Sargent) This is yet another example of fiscal crises that have produced the lasting institutional changes that we sometimes call revolutions. (Sargent, about 1840 state constitution re-writes)
# Change As Result Of Crisis
- I think the issue of change and crises is more nuanced than simply "cobbled together at the bottom of financial cli $s$ " Crises are often the precipitating force, but crises often galvanize the existing forces for reform. They take existing ideas or energize existing platforms.
- Calomiris & Haber argue this point regarding the banking
The timing of the reform of English banking [1826?] illustrates the power of specific historical events to precipitate long-contemplated changes. Political trends and logical arguments may favor reform, but major changes in the structure of financial systems often coincide with crises that galvanize the movement for reform. (fn: for a discussion of the role of financial crises in precipitating major reforms, see Ho man, Postel-Vinay, and Rosenthal (Surviving Large Losses... 2007).) ([?] p 114)
-Friedman argues it more generally:
The only time you can get major change is when there is a crisis. And the function of economists, like you and me, is not really to produce change, it's to make available solutions when a crisis arises. A crisis arises and you're going to take up some solution that is already there. At that time you're not going to get the bottom of it. (Milton Friedman interview with Gary Becker, 2002, minute 29:15)
- "Milton Friedman said that countries confront problems only after they have become crises" ([?] p 12)
- "This is yet another example of fiscal crises that have produced the lasting institutional changes that we sometimes call revolutions." ([?] p 26 talking about the US federal government not paying state debts (from default in late 1830s), and how in the 1840s this led to "more than half of the U. S. states rewrote their state constitutions to require year-by-year balanced budgets")
# 4 The Financial & The Real Economy
# Contents
# Connecting The Real And Financial Economies
- In some ways easy, in others di cult
- Easy: finance forms foundation for economy
- Often ignored, but as The Economist says:
What is mankind's greatest invention? Ask people this question and they are likely to pick familiar technologies such as printing or electricity. They are unlikely to suggest an innovation that is just as significant: the financial contract.
- Becomes obvious once we look carefully
- Hard: How do nominal variables
(inflation) interact with real variables
(output) - Older (but absolutely wrong): Phillips curve, inflation lower unemployment (higher output)
# Real Economy - Easy To See
What the government does with National Income & Product Accounts
(GDP) - Relatively easy to see
(measure) real economy
US Economy, 2019 & 2020
Real GDP, measured in billions of 2012 dollars
Measures real output - measured in things
- For reference, include some of the things produced in 2019 - automobiles and wheat

# Financial Economy - Foundation For The Real Economy
- Look at real economy - transactions between households, firms, government, ROW
- Easy to see size & complexity of real economy
- Production of cars & computers; transport of food & goods around the world; everyone working, building, consuming, traveling
- Harder to see the complex & interconnected financial economy - the foundation for all the working, building,…

# Real Transactions Requires

(Many) Financial Transactions If Financial System Fails, Economy Collapses

Example - I am buying a new bicycle

January: I order, pay $25\%$

Credit card payments processing, bank credit

- January: store orders from manufacturer, pays $35\%$
- Borrows from bank for extra $10\%$
- February: manufacturer builds
- Must pay workers, buy material. Borrows working capital
(bank) - March: manufacturer ships to store, store pays
- International payments; Store borrows (65% until I pay)
- Even such a simple transaction - buying a bicycle - requires complex & interconnected system
- We never think of those many financial steps
- But if any piece brakes, the real economy stops
- Money & Banks more important than we usually recognize
- April: I pick up bike, pay balance
Credit card, payments processing, bank credit

# Power Of Finance - Bagehot
# Walter Bagehot, Lombard Street (1873)
- Understood the power of finance
A million [pounds] in the hands of a single banker is a great power… But the same sum scattered in tens and fifties through a whole nation is no power at all (p 5)
- But also it's fragility
But in exact proportion to the power of this system is its delicacy I should hardly say too much if I said its danger. Only our familiarity blinds us to the marvelous nature of the system…. If any large fraction of that money really was demanded, our banking system and our industrial system too would be in great danger. (p 11)
- This is the essence of this course: understanding some of the power – and the fragility – of finance

# 5 Overview Of Finance According To Cecchetti & Schoenholtz "Money, Banking, And Financial Markets"
# 5.1 Financial Instruments
# Contents
# Six Parts Of The Financial System

I. Money

II. Financial Instruments

III. Financial Markets

IV. Financial Institutions – Banks

V. Regulatory Agencies

VI. Central Banks

This course focuses on 1,4,6

- Cecchetti & Schoenholtz has a nice overview - their Ch 3 in ebook
# Financial Instruments / Securities
- A financial instrument is the legal obligation
(contract) to transfer something of value at some future date
- Usually transfers of money (versus, say, labor contract which is about labor)
- Very general definition
- Easier to see in examples:
- Bond: government or corporation promises to pay fixed cash flows at specific dates
- Stock or equity: corporation promises to pay portion of profits (if there are any)
Can become very complex - but underlying ideas simple:
- Transfer cash today vs tomorrow
(discounting) - Transfer risk
# Uses Of Financial Instruments

I. Means of Payment

- For purchase of goods and services
- Bank deposit (checking account) is a financial instrument. Use to pay for all kinds of things.
- Electronic funds transfers, use bonds or stocks to pay
II. Store of value
- Transfer value from today into the future
III. Transfer of risk - between people or over time
- Options, swaps, futures. Insurance contracts
# Examples: Financial Instruments We Care About See Cecchetti P 53

I. Government bond. Corporate bond.

II. Equity

III. Foreign Exchange

IV. Bank demand deposits (checking account) - loan to a bank

- Keep Money a little separate
- Sometimes helps to think of money as an idea (process and activities) rather than a thing (financial instrument)
# Bond - Government Or Corporate
- Promises to pay fixed CFs, at fixed dates
- Example: \$6.50 every year for 4yrs, then \$100
- Doesn't have to be fixed CFs (could float up and down) but most bonds
- Store of Value: Transforms current value into future value
- Need to use discounting and PV
- May involve risk
Corporation promises to pay back, but may break promise

# Good Example Of "Financial Instrument"
- Promise to pay you something of value
- Usually pays "money"
(dollars) - but not always - gold clause in bonds prior to 1933
- You need to give up something today to get this
- Can sometimes use as payment
- Government bonds OK
- Corporate bonds poor
- Why? Need to study company to decide how valuable, whether company will pay in future
- Not good as "money" - whatever that is
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/c930dbd1c3d0a7e197df7ac874ae3ca6216645d3e51b9934ebc2fec4575fcb2b.jpg)
# Equity
- Called "Equity" or "Stock"
- Promise of company
(corporation) to pay profits as dividends
- As with bond, transforms current value into future value
- But unlike bond, no promises on how much - just paying out profits
# Foreign Exchange

(Fx) - Buying and selling di erent currencies

- Think of buying US dollars currency, selling British pounds
- Buy US $, Sell UK £
- Sell US $, Buy Chinese ¥
(Yuan) As I have described, a financial transaction
- Actually, most FX transactions are instruments
- Agree to transfer currency in future - maybe 2 days, often 1 month or 6 months in the future (FX forward)
# Bank Demand Deposit - Loan
- Your bank or checking or deposit account
- Hold this for last, because it is so special
- We think of it and call it "money" - but really you are lending to the bank
- You give money today, they promise to give it back
- Special kind of loan, two special characteristics
I. Promise to pay back on demand & at par - $1-per-$1
II. Upon default, pay first-come - first-served
- If you're late, you get nothing
- Strong incentive to get first in line - Bank Runs
- Very di erent than other loans
(bonds) - Regular bond-holders, upon default, get pro-rata share (assets divided according to payment hierarchy)
Money & Bank deposits - topic of my "History of Financial Crises"
# 5.2 Markets
# Contents
# Market As "Information Processing Engine"
- Fundamental idea, throughout economics:
- When prices and markets are free and reflect demand & supply, they pull together a huge amount of information
- Prices convey information - all the information available to everyone - about the value of the thing and alternatives (see Hayek's 1945 address to AEA)
- Two additional benefits:
- Prices are free (or at least pretty cheap)
- Prices provide an incentive to act on the information
- Never, ever ignore market prices - believe markets
- If you disagree, you might be right but you are betting against many other smart people
Hayek, 1945 address to the American Economic Association:
A little reflection will show that there is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation. We need to remember only how much we have to learn in any occupation after our theoretical training, how big a part of our working life we spend learning particular jobs, and how valuable an asset in all walks of life is knowledge of people, of local conditions, and special circumstances. To know of and put to use a machine not fully employed, or somebody's skill which could be better utilized, or to be aware of a surplus stock which can be drawn down during an interruption of supplies, is socially quite as useful as the knowledge of better alternative techniques.
# Types Of Markets

Cecchetti & Schoenholtz p 57

Primary vs Secondary

- Primary: governments or companies sell new securities
- Secondary: we all buy and sell existing securities
Centralized
(auction) vs Over-the-Counter
- Centralized: Such as futures pits, where everyone gets together and prices set, usually by some auction process
- btw, I highly recommend the Eddie Murphy / Dan Akroyd 1983 movie "Trading Places" - good depiction of pit trading
- Secondary: we all buy and sell existing securities
- Underlying vs Derivative
- Underlying: instrument based on an asset and promised CFs
- Derivative: based on some other price. Example: futures, option
# Institutions

Cecchetti & Schoenholtz pp 66-67

I. Banks

- Textbook Depository Institutions (1), Finance Companies (5)
- I group these together because they both take short-term loans from the public and convert to long-term. Important regulatory differences, but economic & financial functions similar. Maybe also GSEs.
Finance Companies often thought of as "shadow banking"
II. Broker Dealers or Securities Firms
- Textbook Securities Firms (4)
III. Investment Managers and Pensions
- Textbook Pension Funds (3)
- Investment management terribly important, and under-represented in texts
IV. Insurance Companies
- Textbook Insurance Companies (2)
V. Central Banks
- Textbook not included, but an important part of the financial industry

# Various Approaches To Studying Financial Crises

Three approaches to study Financial Crises

I. General Model - Kindleberger / Minsky

- Economic & human behavior to explain all crises
II. Quantitative & Econometric - Reinhart & Rogo
- Examine data across time & across countries to develop empirical regularities
III. Narrative & Event - Velde, Calomiris & Haber
- Uncover the specific forces & situation
- Delve into the underlying economic forces of each event
Each has something to contribute
- I lean towards (3) - but as one part of overall understanding
- Need to combine all - working on John Snow & cholera as example
Calomiris & Haber argue that "banking crises are not a regular occurrence across time and countries, and therefore cannot be a consequence of any general economic characteristics of banks." They argue for "the specific political circumstances in which banks operate."
- [?] p xii
A good number of economic theorists have dismissed this sort of work [economic history in general and Kindleberger's book in particular] as being outside the bounds of economics: it conveys suggestions of irrationality…. A book in which the first word of the title suggests insanity is hence o the reservation. Moreover, to the extent that its ideas are expressed in words rather than mathematical symbols and that it uses historical episodes - labeled pejoratively as "anecdotes" - it may be taken to amuse but not to edify.
# "Identification" In Economics: Statistics Vs Narrative

Identification of causal factors / theories

THE key problem in science - correlation vs causation

- Other fields can do controlled experiments (but see cosmology)
- Economics works with "found" data - the world as it is
- People like John List developing experimental economics
- only part
Tension between "Econometric" & "Narrative" approach
- Econometric: statistics to disentangle correlation from causation
- Narrative: combination of data, contemporary accounts, economic logic
Friedman made important contributions
Methodology of Positive Economics: how to develop and test theories
- Monetary History: a powerful example of accumulating data, narrative, logic, episodes to make a convincing argument.
- Convinced economists that money was central to the Great Depression
The debate between di erent "Identification" approaches:
·[?]
- p 451: "Identification" via standard statistical methods and comparative / narrative approach
Economic analysis is all about determining causation. Economists want to understand the structure that connects observed facts. Structural models in economics seek to clearly identify the fundamental sources of shocks in the economy and explain how those shocks elicit the observed behavioral responses of individuals, corporations, governments, and bankers.
To see how useful structural thinking can be, consider the confusion that results from its absence. The 2007-09 U. S. subprime crisis provides an example. Reporters typically listed contributory causes, and some of the assembled lists were extraordinarily long. But some of the items on those lists were symptoms of the crisis, not causes, and others may have contributed to the crisis but were themselves the outcomes of other influences. To identify the underlying factors that caused the crisis, one must build a structural model that connects all the events in a way that convincingly disentangles their causal interconnections.
The dominant approach to identifying causal relationships in social science in general, and in studies of banking in particular, is the use of statistical techniques for imposing "identification restrictions" that guide causal inference. In essence, econometrics uses a priori views from economic and political theories about the likely channels of causation to help distinguish cause from e etc in the analysis of correlations. We are enthusiastic advocates and practitioners of such statistical approaches to identifying causation.
At the same time, we believe that the country histories in this book illustrate the usefulness of an alternative, complementary approach, based on the study of the sequence of events in particular countries over long periods of time.
- Discuss statistical approach vs comparative / narrative
- Issue of "Identification" in economics - trying to identify causal economic relationships. The hardest problem in economics. In science in general. In many other fields researchers can perform "controlled experiments" and hold constant everything except one factor that we want to test. In economics we have "found data" or the real world with all its messiness. We often cannot strip out the influence of all except one variable.
- Broadly two approaches in economics
I. Statistical & Econometric - Reinhart & Rogo - using econometrics and statistical tools to try to disentangle correlation from causation, trying to isolate single exogenous or pre-determined influences.
II. Comparative / narrative - Kindleberger, Calomiris & Haber, Friedman & Schwartz - examining historical episodes in some detail and arguing from an accumulation of evidence from various sources for the exogeneity or independence of some causal factor.
- Digression on Friedman and methodology in economics
- Milton Friedman made some important contributions. Two were:
I. Methodology of Positive Economics
II. A Monetary History of the United States
- Friedman was not opposed to statistics and econometrics - he was in fact a statistician who worked extensively with data. But he was not dogmatically tied to econometric or statistical identification. In fact A Monetary History of the United States was a masterwork of accumulating empirical evidence, contemporary accounts, and economic logic to make a convincing argument about the importance of monetary policy. And most importantly for our purposes that the Fed "caused" the Great Depression.
I am thinking about this a lot nowadays - studying John Snow and his study of the the 1854 cholera epidemic in London ([?], https://ssrn.com/abstract=3262234)
- I examine the story of cholera in 1850s London for three reasons:
I. Interesting Events: a rollicking good tale - full of heroism, death, and statistics
II. Causal Inference: an excellent template for how to marshal evidence in support of a causal explanation
III. Statistics & Instruction: The data are simple but the analysis demonstrates multiple data analytic tools we use today
- combining maps and data (GIS or geographic information systems)
- natural experiments and randomization
- di erence-in-di erences experimental design
- regression and error analysis
- Snow's cholera work is also a humbling reminder of the sometimes meandering path towards truth: even with overwhelming evidence and strong analysis Snow failed to convince the medical establishment, the public, or the authorities
# Causation & Structural Modeling - C&H Ch 14

Economic analysis is all about determining causation. Economists want to understand the structure that connects observed facts.

To see how useful structural thinking can be, consider the confusion that results from its absence. The 2007-09 U. S. subprime crisis provides an example. Reporters typically listed contributory causes… But some of the items on those lists were symptoms of the crisis, not causes…. To identify the underlying factors that caused the crisis, one must build a structural model that connects all the events in a way that convincingly disentangles their causal interconnections.

The dominant approach to identifying causal relationships in social science… is the use of statistical techniques for imposing "identification restrictions"

At the same time, we believe that the country histories in this book illustrate the usefulness of an alternative, complementary approach, based on the study of the sequence of events in particular countries over long periods of time.

# Three Theories Of Banking Crises (C&H Ch 1 & 15)

I. Bank structure - maturity transformation & liquidity issues

- Diamond & Dybvig / deposit insurance here
II. Interbank connections - Externalities
- Bank's private actions (reserves & equity) a ects overall system - need regulation
# Iii. Human Nature
- We are short-sighted, go between over-optimistic & pessimistic
- Minsky & Kindleberger
Calomiris & Haber say these not "wrong" but cannot be right everywhere banking crises have been remarkably absent in many eras and places despite the presence of all these potential causes banking crises are not a regular occurrence across time and countries, and therefore cannot be a consequence of any general economic characteristics of banks (C&H Ch 15)
Instead: "the specific political circumstances in which banks operate."
# I. Bank Structure:
- The maturity and liquidity mismatch between bank deposits
(overnight) and bank assets (loans, which mature in months-to-years)
- Makes banks susceptible to runs
The first formal theory was advanced by Diamond and Dybvig (1983), and there have been many variations produced since. The early theories of liquidity risk implasibly focused on exogenous consumption demands as the source of shocks. More recent work has seen liquidity shocks as emerging from problems associated with default risk. One particularly creative version of this more recent work is Dang, Gorton, and Holmstrom (2012).
# Ii. Interbank Connections
- Externalities: banks make decisions about capital reserves, risk profile, that are individually optimal but ignore the spillover or externality e ccts
- Solved by regulations that require banks to hold extra reserves and capital. See, for example, Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet (2000).
# Iii. Human Nature
- Minsky & Kindleberger
# Banking Crises Depend On Specific Political Circumstances
# Combination Of General And Specific Banking Crises Are Not A Regular Occurrence Across Time And Countries, And Therefore They Cannot Be A Consequence Of Any General Economic Characteristics About Banks. Rather, They Are The Consequence Of General Economic Characteristics About Banks Coupled To The Specific Political Circumstances In Which Banks Operate.

Politics - the long-term institutions and coalitions that shape banking institutions:

By politics… we mean… the way that the fundamental political institutions of a society structure the incentives of politicians, bankers, bank shareholders, depositors, debtors, and taxpayers to form coalitions in order to shape laws, policies, and regulations in their favor – often at the expense of everyone else.

Same ideas as Acemoglu & Robinson in Why Nations Fail

# 7 Types & Lists Of Crises
# Outline
# Contents
# Everyone Says "This Time Is Di Erent"

But it is not. Too often we think the world has changed but it never does

- It has all happened before ("History never repeats itself but it rhymes")
Major Goal: To convince you that financial crises are terrible, but they are not new or di erent or unusual
The essence of the this-time-is-di erent syndrome is simple. It is rooted in the firmly held belief that financial crises are things that happen to other people in other countries at other times. (Reinhart&Rogo p 1)
Examine what happens to other people, at other times, in other countries
- What are financial crises? Banking? Sovereign debt default? Inflation?
- What are the causes of financial crises? Mania and irrationality? Monetary policy mistakes? Too much debt? Political structure?
- What does a financial crisis look like?
I. Financial and liquidity crises like 2008
(A) I will not be talking in any depth about "Financial Risk Management" - the course name was supposed to be changed but was not
II. Whenever one of these happens, we always say "this time is di erent"
(A) In the run-up to the crisis we say that the borrowing or the debt or the stock-market prices or whatever is not too much or too high, that it will not lead to a crisis like it did in 1999 or 1929 or whenever. Because the world is di erent now than it used to be.
1. And maybe this is true, because the world does change - electricity and cars in the 1920s fundamentally changed the world and made everyone richer and better-o. Everyone, both the wealthy in the wealthy nations and the poor in the poor nations. We are immensely richer and better o today than in 1900 - Things like life expectancy have increased immensely - in 1910 the average life expectancy (across the world) was only 33 years. By 1992 it rose to 61 years and is even higher today. (Bourgignon & Morrison table 1). And the internet changed our world in the 1990s and continues to do so.
(B) In the aftermath, during the crisis itself, we always say "this time is di erent", that it has never happened before. That this crisis is uniquely disastrous and unlike anything that has happened before.
2. Because, for most of us, it is disastrous and unique - we have never lived through a crisis like this.
III. My primary purpose in this course is to convince you that, new and exciting as the boom is and shocking and disruptive as the crisis, such events are not new nor di erent - we have seen this all before.
The essence of the this-time-is-di erent syndrome is simple. It is rooted in the firmly held belief that financial crises are things that happen to other people in other countries at other times. [?] p 1
IV. I want to examine what it is that happens to other people, at other times, in other countries
(A) What are financial crises? Banking failures? Sovereign debt default? Inflation?
(B) What are the causes of financial crises? Mania and irrationality? Monetary policy mistakes? Too much debt? Political structure?
(C) What happens during a financial crisis?

Sovereign Defaults - Reinhart & Rogo tables 6.2 & 6.4

Countries have tended to default serially, then "graduate"

- England after 1688, France about 1800, Spain 1882
- Amusing Question - who has defaulted more during 20th c, Greece or Germany?
- Germany more recently than Greece. But Germany has certainly graduated
# Banking Crises - No Graduation

Banking crises more common than debt defaults

- Like sovereign default, serial repeaters.
- Unlike sovereign default, no evidence of "graduation"
Crises from the 1800s sound eerily like today
- "Everybody begging for money" - 1825
- "A contagion of fear spread among depositors" - 1930

Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises

- Classic, but unfortunately the newer editions are really poor
- Appendix is useful under the "Readings" on Modules
Kindleberger's Appendix from 2nd Edition lists numerous financial crises from 1618-1998. The full table is available in the appendix on Canvas Modules.
Historical crises discussed in depth:
- US 1893 banking crisis
- US 1907 banking crisis
- Possibly Barings 1890

# Moving Beyond Lists & Narrative

These lists & databases incredibly useful

- Document and organize history
- Remind us that these happen, and happen regularly
- I learned in trading that individual memory not good enough - history
Reinhart & Rogo database (and World Bank list) provides immense value
Stories are entertaining & instructive. Teach us that some things (human greed, foolishness) never change

# Discussion Questions

Regarding the Reinhard & Rogo reading (Chapter 1 "Varieties of Crises", on Library reserve):

Of the crises defined by quantitative thresholds and those defined by historical events (in Reinhart & Rogo), select one to describe briefly in class. Is there a historical example of this type of crisis that you would like to explore further? Why?

From the Kindleberger readings (Chapters 2 & 3, on Library Reserve):

Name the five stages in Minsky's model (From Kindleberger). Minsky's model usually revolves around one country. Explain how a shock in a single country can impact other countries. Provide examples from the readings.

# 2 Kindleberger & Minsky "Model"
# Outline
# Contents
# Kindleberger & Minsky - Descriptive Rather Than Analytic

Not a "model" in the sense that we at Harris think of models

- Theoretical frameworks that give predictions.
Largely descriptive.
- Nonetheless, useful throughout my career.
- Helps to organize observations and thinking about events.
- Incredibly useful in the run-up and aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, to help recognize that the crisis was simply one in a long line of financial crises.
I bet there is in fact a substantive economic model hidden within but I have not had the intelligence nor the stamina to develop one
# Kindleberger & Minsky - Descriptive, But Valuable

Kindleberger (from Minsky) proposes that manias and panics have the following characteristics:

- Displacement and opportunity
Economic growth and expansion
- Monetary expansion
Euphoria
- Speculation and asset price inflation
Financial distress
- Crisis and debt deflation
- Renewal and recovery
Not a "model" as a theoretical framework that gives predictions.
- Largely descriptive. Nonetheless, helpful to organize thoughts about crises
But we do want to go deeper
Before turning to the 1790, South Sea, and Mississippi events, a brief introduction to the Kindleberger & Minsky "model".
This is not a "model" in the sense that we at Harris think of models – theoretical frameworks that give predictions. This is largely descriptive. In spite of this I have found it very useful throughout my career. It helps to organize the observations and my thinking about events. I am sure there is in fact a substantive economic model hidden within but I have not had the intelligence nor the stamina to develop one.
And I found it incredibly useful in the run-up and the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, to help recognize that the crisis was simply one in a long line of financial crises.
- Displacement and opportunity - an event, such as the widespread adoption of a technology with pervasive effects, that alters the economic outlook by changing profit opportunities
- Economic growth and expansion - the displacement opens profit opportunities in new areas. Firms and individuals take advantage and growth takes o, led by new investment, capital spending, and profits generated from the new opportunities
- Monetary expansion - the economic expansion is fed and often accelerated by an expansion in credit and the money supply
- Euphoria - the growth in new areas, returns from capital investment, and rising incomes provide a positive feedback which itself gives rise to new profit opportunities - the best of all possible worlds
- Speculation and asset price inflation - the positive feedback can be so strong that it overtakes the original displacement and opportunity, with speculation for price increases largely replacing investment for production and sale. (Note, however, that full-blown speculation is never easy to distinguish from balanced assessment of new opportunities until well after the fact.)
- Financial distress - at some stage new recruits to speculation are balanced by those insiders who decide to take profits and sell out - possibly in the fear that a rush for liquidity would generate losses and it would be better to take what is available rather than hold out for the last of the profits. This period of distress, where asset prices flatten out, has historically lasted for a number of months.
- Crisis and debt deflation - a sudden fall, first in the price of the primary object of speculation, then in most or all assets. The rush for liquidity is on. Bankruptcies increase. Liquidation speeds up, sometimes degenerating into panic. The value of collateral collapses - credit and money sharply contract. Real interest rates rise even as nominal rates fall, since the nominal price level tends to fall.
- Renewal and recovery - debt deflation ends as productive assets move from financially weak owners (often speculators or the original entrepreneurs) to financially strong owners (well-capitalized financiers). This provides the foundation for another cycle, assuming that all the required factors (displacement, monetary expansion, appetite for speculation) are present
# "Financial Crisis As Mania" Is Tempting

Should not be lured into thinking that mania and speculation is the whole story Macdonald & Velde approach to South Sea Bubble and John Law & Mississippi Co - much deeper and informative

- Britain: consolidation & transformation of gov't financing and market structure
- France: Law's Monetary & Fiscal objectives - truly radical for the time
- This view of financial crises as manias and speculative bubbles is seductive but as economists we want to think more deeply and carefully
- The approach of Macdonald & Velde to John Law & the Mississippi Co. is instructive. They look beneath the surface painted by Mackay & Kindleberger to uncover the economic forces that helped to drive the crises.
- Remember Law's to objectives (lecture 3): Monetary & Fiscal

# 3 Barings Brothers 1890 Sovereign Debt Crisis
# Contents
# Barings Brothers 1890 As Example Of Kindleberger "Model"
Let's use the 1890 Barings crisis to understand the Kindlberger model a little better
The Baring Crisis is the nineteenth century's most famous sovereign debt crisis. (Mitchner & Y Weidenemeir 2006)
Barings Brothers was one of the top-notch Merchant Banks - private banks - that dominated investment, banking, and wealth in London, and thus the world. Owned by members of the Barings family.
Two particularly interesting aspects
I. A private "bail-out" by market participants, very much like LTCM in 1998, and the transfer of deposits to First Republic Bank in March 2023
II. Argentina defaulting on sovereign bonds - sounds very modern
Displacement & Opportunity and Economic Growth & Expansion
Investors throughout 1800s believed there were unusual opportunities in Latin America
- Even back in 1720s, South Sea Bubble was about trading with Spanish America
- Kindleberger's table shows "clearing of southern lands" and "Brazil, co ee"...
# Background:
- Argentine loan, Barings 1824, default and consolidated in 1857
- In 1870s Argentina suffered bad crisis, saved by the Barings
- Problems in Argentina: 1885 suspended gold standard; faulty fiscal planning led to inflation
# Euphoria And Speculation
Speculation and over-investment in Argentine securities, particularly by Barings Brothers
Between 1881 and 1889, British banks took Argentine loans worth over £85,000,000. In most of these loans Barings was the leading house.
Under leadership of Edward Charles Baring (Lord Revelstoke 1885) "Barings had placed in the market nineteen million pounds' worth of Argentine loans in the past seven years. Apparently the philosophy of conservatism... were temporarily abandoned. Even among the firm's partners there was no agreement about Lord Revelstoke's methods."
In 1888, Argentina received £36,102,766 in various loans from Europe. 'No warning can save a people determined to grow suddenly rich,' said the great British banker, Samuel Jones Lloyd (later Lord Overston).
# Financial Distress
- Problems in Argentina: 1885 suspended gold standard; faulty fiscal planning led to inflation
In November 1888 a £3.5 million o ering of the Buenos Ayres [sic] Drainage and Waterworks Company failed, and Barings felt obliged to lend to Argentina through acceptance credits. Falling raw materials prices in 1890 made it impossible for the Argentine government to meet these credits as they came due.
- Bank of England raised Bank rate from $3\%$ to $4\%$ (to curb drain of gold) in June
1890. Raised to $6\%$ on Friday Nov 7.
    - Rumors about "a certain house" which might fail.
# Crisis And Recovery
- Wonderful details of comings and goings of bankers and politicians
# Goschen Conversion:
- George Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen, was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 14-jan-1887 to 11-aug-1892.
- In 1888 Converted $3\%$ Consols to $2.75\%$ (£2 15s) through April 1903 and $2.5\%$ (£2 10s) thereafter.
- In other words, lowered the interest cost of the government (during a period of falling interest rates)
# Outline Of 1890 Barings Crisis Thomas Coleman
Taken from The Merchant Bankers, Joseph Wechsberg, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London,
1967. Some from Kindleberger. More references at the end.
"The Baring crisis, the firm's worst ordeal and the most dangerous predicament in the whole history of merchant banking, occurred in
1968. The seeds of trouble had been planted much earlier. In the 1820's Argentina suddenly became a glamorous attraction for the investors and speculators in the City of London." (Wechsberg, p. 131)
# Background:
- First Argentine loan, $6\%$ £1mn Buenos Aires issue, at 85, o ered by the Barings in 1824, went into default and consolidated in 1857. (p. 132).
- In 1870s Argentina suffered bad crisis, saved by the Barings
- Tide turned, in 1870 40,000 immigrants; by 1889 260,000. In 1878 Argentina started exporting wheat
- "Between 1881 and 1889, British banks took Argentine loans worth over £85,000,000. In most of these loans Barings was the leading house." (p 132)
- Under leadership of Edward Charles Baring (Lord Revelstoke 1885) "Barings had placed in the market nineteen million pounds' worth of Argentine loans in the past seven years. Apparently the philosophy of conservatism... were temporarily abandoned. Even among the firm's partners there was no agreement about Lord Revelstoke's methods." (W p. 134)
# Problems In Argentina:
- 1885 suspended gold standard; faulty fiscal planning led to inflation. "In 1888, Argentina received £36,102,766 in various loans from Europe. 'No warning can save a people determined to grow suddenly rich,' said the great British banker, Samuel Jones Lloyd (later Lord Overston)."
# Proximate Details:
- "In November 1888 a £3.5 million o ering of the Buenos Ayres [sic] Drainage and Waterworks Company failed, and Barings felt obliged to lend to Argentina through acceptance credits. Falling raw materials prices in 1890 made it impossible for the Argentine government to meet these credits as they came due." (Kindelberger p. 122)
- Bank of England raised Bank rate from $3\%$ to $4\%$ (to curb drain of gold) in June 1890. (Wechsberg p. 133). Raised to $6\%$ on Friday Nov 7.
- Rumors about "a certain house" which might fail.
# Details Of Crisis And Bail-Out:
- Sir Everard Hambro met Sat Nov 8 with Rotschilds, then BoE. At BoE Hambro "told [Governor] Lidderdale that Barings was 'much involved.' Lord Revelstoke [of Barings] had said to him [Fri night], 'I shall be able to tell you on Monday whether we can go on or whether we have to stop.'" (W p. 136). Later that morning a meeting at Hambros with Lidderdale, Revelstoke, Francis Baring, not conclusive.
- Conclusion was that Barings basically sound, needed time.
- Monday, Lidderdale ascertained BoE reserves £10.815mn, inadequate. Lidderdale met with Chancellor of the Exchequer Goschen. Goschen helped influence Rothschilds to influence Banque de France to lend BoE £3.5mn in gold. (W pp. 137-138)
- Wednesday Baring Brothers presented statement (W. p. 138):
- Liabilities £21mn, of which £16mn were acceptances
- Assets worth £24.75mn, but £5.75mn Argentine loans and £2mn Uruguay which "at the moment' could not be realized." I.e. illiquid securities made up £7.75mn, and maybe they would have been worth less if sold.
- Friday afternoon "Barings' bills began to pour in at the Bank of England" (W. p. 139). Lidderdale obtained guarantee from PM "that the British government would bear 'half of any loss that might result between two P. M. Friday and two P. M. Saturday." (W. p 140)
- By Friday, idea of a private collective guarantee took form. (W. pp. 141-142)
- By 11am Sat Lidderdale had £6.5mn, enough to free the Treasury of its liability.
- By 4pm up to £14mn. Eventually, £17.5mn (given as £17,326,000 on p. 144).
- "It was decided among all guarantors that they would help Barings to discharge at maturity its liabilities existing on the night of November 15,1890 [Saturday], and to make good any loss that might appear at the final liquidation. As security the Bank of England took over from Barings 'all the Bonds and Documents representing value.'" (W. p 142)
- "Baring Brothers was reconstructed as a limited company with a capital of one million pounds, and was henceforth known as Baring Brothers & Co., Ltd." (W pp. 143-144)
- Discharge of obligations: "It proved impossible to wind up everything within three years – the time for which the guarantors had undertaken their guarantee – but it became apparent that within another year all commitments would be met... By 1894 Barings had paid o all obligations." (W p. 144) In October 1894 BoE issued circular to all guarantors notifying o cial ending.
Bottom line - guarantors took over the risk, taking collateral, and restructuring Barings in the process. It's not clear from this description what compensation the guarantors got.
# From Wikipedia:
The Panic of 1890 was an acute depression that was less serious than other panics of the era precipitated by the near insolvency of the Baring Brothers bank in London due mainly to poor investments in Argentina. The Bank of England bailed out the Baring Brothers which prevented a larger depression.[citation needed] Nathan Rothschild remarked that if this had not happened, perhaps the entire private banking system of London would have collapsed which would have made for a tremendous economic catastrophe. The panic was associated with call money reaching an astonishing 45 percent and a slump in the commodity market the world over.
The Baring Crisis is the nineteenth century ŠoS most famous sovereign debt crisis. Few studies, however, have attempted to understand the extent to which the crisis mattered for countries other than Argentina and England. Using a new database consisting of more than 15,000 observations of weekly sovereign debt prices, we first assess the extent to which the Barings Crisis a ected other emerging-market borrowers. Using event studies, we find empirical evidence of a regional crisis. Following the onset of the crisis in 1890, sovereign yield spreads for Central and South American borrowers increased by nearly 800 basis points in the year following the crisis and by nearly 1,400 basis points in the five years after the crisis, while interest-rate spreads in other emerging-market borrowers were generally flat. We next consider whether the regional crisis in Central and South American identified with time series data can be explained by country-specific information that was available to investors in the nineteenth century. Using a panel data set of 28 countries for the period 1886-96, we find Latin American countries saw their yield spreads during the crisis rise by between 150-470 basis points even after controlling for macroeconomic, trade, political-institutional factors, or other country-specific ects. We speculate that European investors may have experienced a wake-up call and sold or reduced their holdings of Latin American securities in the wake of the Baring Crisis.
# Some Thoughts Re Barings Brothers 1890
Some remarkable similarities to LTCM 1998 (and First Republic 2023?)
Possible paper topic
Important thought re risk, incentives, & "skin in the game"
- Barings was private - still made poor decisions
Under leadership of Edward Charles Baring (Lord Revelstoke 1885) "Barings had placed in the market nineteen million pounds' worth of Argentine loans in the past seven years. Apparently the philosophy of conservatism... were temporarily abandoned. Even among the firm's partners there was no agreement about Lord Revelstoke's methods." (Wp. 134)
# 4 Calomiris & Haber: Framework
# 4.1 Introduction - Banking & Property Rights
# Contents
# "Property Rights" & "Political Economy"
Property Rights; Political Economy; Law & Economics; Public Choice
- Applying Price Theory (incentives, budget constraints, preferences) to large social questions
Chicago has a long tradition (Law & Economics)
Stigler (& Peltzman): regulatory capture interest groups and other political participants will use the regulatory and coercive powers of government to shape laws and regulations in a way that is beneficial to them.
- Coase: Externalities & Coase Theorem: with no transaction costs who owns property rights has no e ect on the economic ciency.
- Property rights matter for distribution of income but not e ciency
- Transaction costs, property rights matter to efficiency
For this (C&H on banking, A&R on nations) look outside Chicago
Property Rights; Political Economy; Law & Economics; Public Choice
I. This is a set of related terms & concepts, around the idea of applying Price Theory (incentives, budget constraints, preferences) to large social questions
II. Chicago has a long tradition in this, although interestingly with this specific area (Calomiris & Haber on Banking & Finance; Acemoglu & Robinson on di erential growth of nations) the interesting work has been done outside of Chicago. (Although now, with Robinson here, some of the important work is again being done here at Chicago)
(A) Aaron Director - came to Chicago Law School in 1946, trained "generations of law students and even his colleagues on the faculty in this then-new way of thinking about the law" (UofC press release on Director's death - http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/04/040913director.shtml)
Law and Economics as a field attempts to apply the scientific methods of economics—including statistics and price theory—to behaviors that in the past had been analyzed solely by appeal to the history and intuitions of the law. With coherent theory, precise hypotheses and a willingness to subject those hypotheses to empirical tests, it has transformed legal thinking in the United States and in many nations around the world. (UofC press release on Director's death - http://www.news.uchicago.edu/releases/04/040913.director.shtml)
1. Aaron Director also has the distinction of helping to bring Milton Friedman to Chicago (see paper by David Mitch in October 2016 JPE - Director was not in the economics department but was an ally of Knight and some of his students - Simons, Mints), and of being Friedman's brother-in-law (Rose Director sat next to Friedman in economics and they eventually married)
(B) George Stigler - Regulatory Capture
2. "Stigler is best known for developing the Economic Theory of Regulation, also known as capture, which says that interest groups and other political participants will use the regulatory and coercive powers of government to shape laws and regulations in a way that is beneficial to them."
3. Ideas that are crucial for Calomiris & Haber's argument, but they actually do not cite Stigler very extensively
4. Another important name for government regulation: Sam Peltzman (business school - noted for his distinctive sartorial style)
(C) Ronald Coase - Externalities & the "Coase Theorem"
5. The idea of externalities – that costs (or benefits) from an activity may be born by people who do not choose the activity – is central to understanding many issues in public policy, pollution, and many others aspects of economics.
6. Coase had the central insight – an insight that had escaped earlier economists – that externalities should disappear in a world of perfect information and no transactions costs. In such a world agents can negotiate side-payments and return to equilibrium.
7. This is not to say that we actually live in such a world, but it forces us to think about why externalities matter – not because of the externalities per se but because of the transactions costs or informational asymmetries
8. Coase Theorem says that in the absence of transaction costs the assignment of property rights has no effect on the economically e cient outcome. It will obviously have equity e ects.
9. It also forces us to think carefully about property rights, and is closely connected with the area of Law and Economics that has been important at Chicago since at least the 1940s.
10. "The Problem of Social Cost" published in the Journal of Law and Economics,
11. Apparently "the most-referenced article in both legal and economics scholarship." (http://www.law.uchicago.edu/alumni/magazine/fall11/lawandecon-history - also has the story of dinner at Director's house after the workshop where the group went from 20-1 against the Coase theorem to all in favor)
12. Example of cattle rancher & farmer (from paper, this quote from Wikipedia):
Coase argued that without transaction costs the initial assignment of property rights makes no difference to whether or not the farmer and rancher can achieve the economically efficient outcome. If the cost of restraining cattle by, say, building a fence, is less than the cost of crop damage, the fence will be built. The initial assignment of property rights determines who builds the fence. If the farmer is responsible for the crop damage, the farmer will pay for the fence (as long the fence costs less than the crop damage). If the rancher is responsible for the crop damage, the rancher will build the fence. The allocation of property rights is primarily an equity issue, with consequences for the distribution of income and wealth, rather than an efficiency issue.

# (1) Banking Important For Growth
Holland, Britain, US - financial revolutions before rise as economic superpowers (18th c, 19th c, 20th c).
We studied France, England, US
- 1720, early in Britain's financial revolution - but not France.
- Britain vs France in 1788
- France Debt%GDP about 1/3rd but debt service 1.5x larger
- Britain more debt - lenders believed they would pay back
- Britain lower interest - lenders believed Britain was less risk
US grew faster than Britain early 1800s (after 1790-92 US revolution)

# Banking Important For Growth

Under-appreciated: innovations in standards, process.

Holland, Britain (18th c): Perpetual annuity

- Renaissance Italy: development of accounting
Contemporary economies: financial development faster rates of physical capital accumulation, more jobs, social mobility
# Real Transactions Requires

(Many) Financial Transactions If Financial System Fails, Economy Collapses

Example - I am buying a new bicycle

January: I order, pay $25\%$

Credit card payments processing, bank credit

January: store orders from manufacturer, pays $35\%$

Borrows from bank for extra $10\%$

- February: manufacturer builds
- Must pay workers, buy material. Borrows working capital
(bank) - March: manufacturer ships to store, store pays
- International payments; Store borrows (65% until I pay)
- Even such a simple transaction - buying a bicycle - requires complex & interconnected system
- We never think of those many financial steps
- But if any piece brakes, the real economy stops
- Money & Banks more important than we usually recognize
- April: I pick up bike, pay balance
Credit card, payments processing, bank credit

# Calomiris & Haber Framework
# I. Three Basic Observations

(A) Banking & financial institutions important for economic growth

(B) Big differences across countries

- Stability of banking systems
E ciency of banking services
(C) Although highly regulated, outcomes often bad
# Ii. Banking & Economic Growth

(A) Economic historians have shown that Holland, Britain, US had financial revolutions before their rise as economic superpowers (Holland 18th c, Britain 19th c, US 20th c).

(B) We spent time on France & England in 1720, which was the early part of Britain's financial revolution – but not France. Consider Britain vs France in 1788 – slide with data from "Free Nation Deep in Debt" by James Macdonald (p 241) comparing France & England.

1. France had Debt%GDP about 1/3rd of England but debt service that was about 1.5x larger. Rate for France about $6.7\%$, for England about $3.3\%$.
2. It may not seem important, but I think it is - England's liquid, deep, standardized market (based on a single perpetual annuity issue, Consols) versus France's illiquid and complex market (based on combination of life annuities, lotteries, perpetual annuities).
3. We too often under appreciate innovations in things like standards, process. The perpetual annuity, that was standardized, transferrable, easy to calculate, probably contributed to this.
4. Saw this in Renaissance Italy with the development of accounting. A big impact from what we now think of just a process improvement.
(C) Looking at contemporary economies and using statistical methods people find the same answer: higher levels of financial development are associated with (and appear to be causally associated with) faster rates of physical capital accumulation, better job, mobility.
# (2A) Di Erences In Stability

C&H argue that crises across countries non-random

If such catastrophes were random events, all countries would su er them with equal frequency…. Some countries appear immune to the disease, while others are unusually susceptible. (p 5)

[only] three of the 21 crisis-prone countries [are developed]…. being crisis prone is connected to other undesirable traits and outcomes.

# Two Strands Of Data

I. 117 countries for 1970-2010 (41 years)

- Some countries no crises, many multiple

```latex
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

II. US vs Canada for 170 years since 1840

US 12 crises, Canada 0

# Are The Data Convincing?

Are Some Countries Crisis-Prone?

I think so, but not as convincing as C&H claim random equal frequency? NO

117 countries across 41 years

```latex
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & 0 & 1+ \\ \hline actual count & 34 & 83 \\ \hline actual % & 29% & 71% \\ \hline pred% p=2.9%/yr & 30% & 70% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

What if all countries identical,

Chance of crisis each year $= 2.9\%$

By chance, some countries no crisis

P[crisis in 41 years | p in 1 yr = 2.9%] = 30%

Few developed repeaters non-random? NO

2x2 contingency table: Developed x Crisis-prone

```latex
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

Not-Develop & 67 & 18 & 85 \\ \hline
Total & 96 & 21 & 117 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

Is 3 developed repeaters too low?

NO. Few developed overall (32)

Predict 5.7 if purely independent

Low but not low enough - could be random

Chi-sq or Fisher test: p-value 0.23 / 0.18

Bottom line: interesting but not convincing data

Example of need to think carefully about data & probability

# I. Divergence Across Countries In Stability Of Banking Systems

(A) Financial Stability (or lack): C&H argue that the pattern across countries is non-random ([Calomiris and Haber(2015)] 5&6), with some countries having crises and others not. They 1) comparing across 117 countries and 2) compare US & Canada (claiming 12 crises since 1840 in US, none in Canada)

1.117 countries 1970-2010 (41 years). 34 (29%) had no crisis. 83 (71%) had $1+$. US had 2 (1984-1991,2008). C&H claim this shows crises are non-random and that some countries are direent from others: "If such catastrophes were random events, all countries would suffer them with equal frequency." "Some countries appear immune to the disease, while others are unusually susceptible." (p 5) This sounds convincing but is wrong. We need to be careful in thinking probabilistically, and this is an example where failing to think carefully can mislead us. Say all 117 countries were independent, and each country had $2.9\%$ chance of a crisis each year (independent across years), then the predicted or expected number of countries with 0, $1+$ events would look like:

```latex
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & 0 & 1+ & & 0 & 1 & 2+ \\ \hline actual count & 34 & 83 & actual count & 34 & 62 & 21 \\ \hline actual % & 29% & 71% & actual % & 29% & 53% & 18% \\ \hline pred % for p=2.9%/yr & 30% & 70% & pred % for p=2.9%/yr & 30% & 37% & 33% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

This is a binomial process so the probability of 0 events is $\mathsf{P}[0 \text{ drawsoutof } 41 \mid \mathsf{p} \text{ eachdraw} = 0.029] = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} = \binom{41}{0} p^0 (1 - p)^{41}$. Here countries having no crisis are lucky; they are not fundamentally di erent. Observed di erences result purely from random fluctuations.

2. I happen to believe countries are di erent. But the evidence to support this is more subtle than simply looking at the comparison across 117 countries that C&H present. They emphasize the small number of countries with no crises $(29\%)$ and the large number with $2+$ crises ("18 percent of the countries in the world appear to have been preternaturally crisis prone.") But the simple binomial model (all countries independent) predicts a small number of countries with no crises, and an even larger number with $2+$ crises: $32\%$ (instead of $18\%$ ).

```latex
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline actual count & 34 & 62 & 18 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline actual % & 29% & 53% & 16% & 1% & 1% \\ \hline pred % for p=2.2%/yr & 30% & 37% & 22% & 8% & 3% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

We could argue that these data show too few repeaters, not too many no-crisis countries.

 i. Here are formal statistical tests on the data.

 ii. On the two-outcome table (0 crises vs 1+ crises):

	- chi-sq test for obs=(34,83) vs p=(0.30,0.70).

	- The probabilities are the binomial probabilities (see table above) and they imply (for 117 total) counts of (35.1,81.9)

	- R-code: chisq.test(c(34,83), p=c(0.3,0.7)): chi-sq=0.0492, df=1, p-value=0.8244.

	- A very high p-value (0.8244) means that such an outcome is very likely and we cannot reject the observed data being produced from a simple binomial

	- This is obvious - the actual are almost exactly the same as probabilities. So test should have a very low chi-sq statistic and p-value far away from $1\%$ or $5\%$.

	- A p-value of $1\%$ would imply that the observations are unlikely to have been produced by the probabilities (0.3,0.7)

 iii. For three-outcome table $(0,1,2+$ crises):

	- chi-sq test for obs=(34,62,21) vs p=(0.3,0.37,0.33).

Predicted counts (35.1,43.3,38.6)

	- R-code: chisq.test(c(34,62,21), p=c(0.3,0.37,0.33)): chi-sq=16.1529, df=2, p-value=0.0003.

	- The data clearly reject simple binomial. But actually the problem is observing too few single crises, not too many $2+$ crises.

 iv. For five-outcome table $(0,1,2,3,4+$ crises):

	- chi-sq test for obs=(34,62,18,1,1) vs p=(0.3,0.37,0.22,0.08,0.03).

Predicted counts (35.1,43.3,25.7,9.4,3.5)

	- R-code: chisq.test(c(34,62,18,1,1), p=c(0.3,0.37,0.22,0.08,0.03)): chi-sq=19.87, df=4, p-value=0.0005.3. There are two strands of better evidence in favor of differences across countries. First, Looking at which countries are serial crisis countries the list [of crisis-prone countries] includes Chad, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, the Philippines roughly one-third [of the 117 countries] are categorized… as high income nations. But only three of the 21 crisis-prone countries, 14 percent, are in this group. This suggests that, for the most part, being crisis prone is connected to other undesirable traits and outcomes. But that raises another troubling question. Why is the United States on this list?" [Calomiris and Haber(2015)] p 7

Serial crisis countries appear to be largely politically unstable countries. This is an indication that banking crises are associated with political structure (the major thesis of Calomiris & Haber)

But this actually doesn't help too much either. If we do a test of the 2x2 contingency table:

```latex
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & 1 & 2+ & Total \\ \hline
Developed & 29 & 3 & 32 \\ \hline
Not-Develop & 67 & 18 & 85 \\ \hline
Total & 96 & 21 & 117 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
``` we cannot reject that this contingency table results from random fluctuations: given the row sums (developed vs non-developed) and column sums (number of crises) the cell entries are not unusual enough to reject random variation from an independent sample.
    - We know the column entry for $2+$ (3 developed countries (Spain, Sweden, US) and 21 total)
    - We don't know the total number of developed. But I got the spread-sheet from the World Bank Financial Structure Database (FinancialStructureandDevelopmentDataset.xlsx) and counted the number of HighIncome OECD countries as 32 (27% of 117, so close to C&H's "roughly one-third"). The rest of the entries follow from that. (Entries that I have inferred are in italic.
    - Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates's continuity correct is: Chi-sq = 1.4702, df=1, p-value = 0.225. I.e. the chi-squared is not large and therefore the data are actually not far from independent - we cannot reject independence.
    - Fisher's exact test has a p-value of 0.1808, so same answer.
    - If we calculate the expected cell counts we can see why we cannot reject independence: the low number of Developed $2+$ crisis (3) is just not low enough. The expected number is pretty low (5.7) and the observed (3) is simply not low enough to reject the possibility that it is simply random variation.
    - We calculate the row and column percentages and then the expected cell proportions from pi.*p.j. The predicted cell proportions, given the row and column proportions, are not different enough from the actual.

# 4.3 Digression On Thinking Probabilistically

# Birthday Problem

A few minutes to discuss probability and thinking carefully Humans are not, apparently, wired to think naturally about probability Birthday Problem

- You enter a room with 20 people, so you are the 21st.
- What is probability two people (out of the 21) have birthday same day of the year?
- Natural to think: low, since there are 365 days to choose from
Actual: high, 44.4%
Here's what I think is the mistake:
Natural: same birthday as me: something like $21 / 365 = 6\%$
- Need to think: how many possible pairs? Many pairs, so likely: $44.4\%$
# Thinking Probabilistically

Not easy, and something we need training in

A whole field built up around this - behavioral economics - pointing out that humans make mistakes

- Kahneman & Tversky - Kahneman 2002 Nobel, author of Thinking Fast and Slow
But many things are hard – quantum mechanics, relativity for example – but we use it every day (fiber optics, GPS)
Think carefully about probability (and economics)
Good book by Gigerenzer - Calculated Risks
# [Gigerenzer(2002)]
# Cancer Testing

Real-life problem - testing for cancer (prostate or breast)

Test is $99\%$ reliable - 1 chance out of 100 of false positive

- Doctor tells you test positive
What is the chance you have cancer?
Natural to think $99\%$, but that is completely and totally wrong
Think this way (simple way to apply Bayes rule)
- If 1,000 people take the test, how many people show up with positive?
10 (1%) from false positive - no cancer
- How many truly with cancer? Maybe 1 out of 1,000 (cancer rare)
- So 11 have positive test, only $1 / 11$ (9%) chance you have cancer
# These Things Matter
# Monty Hall Problem

Game show - Let's Make a Deal

- Three doors, 1 car & 2 goats
- You choose door 1, Monty opens one of the other doors to show a goat
- Do you stay or do you switch?
- Stay: 1/3 chance of winning car (same as no door opening)
- Switch: 2/3 chance of winning car
# Much Debate – Books Written About This – But Solution Is Right

I. Monty Hall problem & solution depends on the way Monty Hall opens the door, the rules that he follows. Here, assume Monty Hall follows these rules:

(A) Never open the door the contestant has chosen

(B) If the car is behind the contestant's door (so that the two non chosen doors have goats), randomly choose which goat door to open

(C) If the car is behind one of the two non chosen doors (so only one non chosen door has a goat), open that goat door

II. See my CFA book A Practical Guide to Risk Management, p 25, and also Rosenhouse (2009) The Monty Hall Problem.

(A) This came to prominence with Marilyn vos Savant (1990 in Parade magazine and 1996 book)

III. There has been a huge amount of controversy and debate about this, but take my word that this is the correct solution (given the rules stated).

# Probability Model:
- Assume two countries (Canad & US) the same, each with probability $2.9\%/\mathrm{yr}$ of a crisis
- P[0 crises in 171 years | p/yr = 2.9%] = PDF[BinomialDistribution[171,0.029], 0] = 0.0067
- P[5+ crises in 171 year | p/yr = 2.9%] = 1-CDF[BinomialDistribution[171,0.029], 4] = 0.550
Actually, $p / y_r = 2.9\%$ is too low for US because this predicts mean of 5.0 crises (mean $= p^* y_r s = 0.029^* 171$ ). $P[10 + ] = 0.027$. Need higher probability, something like $5\%$
- P[0 crises in 171 years | p/yr = 5%] = PDF[BinomialDistribution[171,0.05], 0] = 0.00016
- P[10+ crises in 171 year | p/yr = 5%] = 1-CDF[BinomialDistribution[171,0.05], 9] = 0.345
# Us Vs Canada, 1840-2010

Why this big difference?

- Both countries, particularly in the 19th c, were agrarian, experiencing westward expansion, sparse population
- Yet the outcomes were so di erent. Why?
Calomiris & Haber argue di erence in political institutions
US gave control over banks ("charters") to states
- A coalition of interested parties – agrarian populists & small bankers – captured control in early 1800s
Best explanation I've seen yet for
- Pattern of repeated crises: US since early 1800s, Britain 18thc & 19thc
- Stark differences across countries
I. Second, looking at much longer time spans – in this case the US versus Canada. Calomiris & Haber claim that the US is crisis-prone and Canada not. I find this much more convincing. They look at 1837-2008
(A) US: 14 crises: 1837-39,1857,1861,1873,1884,1890,1893,1896,1907,1920s, 1930-33,1980s, 2007-09
(B) Reinhart & Rogo count 9, not all the same: 1836-38,1857,1873,1884,1890 (but I think they mean 1893), 1907,1929-1933,1984-91,2007-09
(C) C&H say Canada: 2: 1837 &
1839. No severe runs or financial crises since
(D) Reinhart & Rogo count 1 (see table A-3 not A-4). Remember from Lecture 6 that Reinhart & Rogo define two types of banking crises: Type I
(severe) are bank runs & failures. Type II
(mild) are stress, closure or takeover of a large bank. Canada had many of Type II (8) but only 1 of Type I.
(E) Why this big di erence? Both countries, particularly in the 19th c, were experiencing westward expansion, sparse population, agrarian. And yet the outcomes were so di erent. Why? I think Calomiris & Haber provide the explanation

# Fundamental Idea: Implicit Bargains

Think carefully about the economic incentives and goals of di erent actors

- Politicians, bankers, taxpayers, shareholders, taxpayers, voters
Move away from idea that public o cials are perfectly rational and always doing the right thing.
- Not necessarily corrupt, just fallible and responding to incentives our goal… is not to blame…. People pursue their self-interest, and one of the ways they do that is by exercising their political rights. When they are able to form a political coalition in the pursuit of mutual advantage, they will do so. (p 213)
 deals are intended to improve the welfare of the members of those coalitions and of the group in control of the government, not of society at large…. This situation implies that many parties may be excluded from beneficial deals. (p 38)
Importance of looking across countries and at history
I. Calomiris & Haber fundamental idea: Implicit contracts or bargains between groups (politicians, bankers, taxpayers, shareholders)
(A) pushes us to think carefully about the economic incentives and goals of di erent actors. An application of micro-economics.
(B) Move away from idea that public o cials are perfectly rational and always doing the right thing.
1. Not necessarily corrupt, just fallible and responding to incentives: C&H state "Our goal in examining [the 2008 crisis] is not to blame"
(C) pp 17-20 provides a summary of the narrative for the US. p 20: "our focus is on the institutions that shape the incentives of individuals and groups, not the individuals and groups per se. People everywhere generally pursue their self-interest."
(D) This is only a partial story - banks, not all financial markets (see p 23 )
(E) They argue for the importance of looking at a long history for understanding complex systems (p. 25 )
 banks' strengths and shortcomings are the predictable consequences of political bargains and that those bargains are structured by a society's fundamental political institutions. (p x)
What this is not: Blame Game
Lest we be misunderstood, our goal in this chapter and the next is not to blame large banks, the GSEs, the urban poor, activist groups, politicians, or regulators for the subprime crisis. People everywhere generally pursue their self-interest, and one of the ways they do that is by exercising their political rights. When they are able to form a political coalition in the pursuit of mutual advantage, they will do so…. No individual or group of individuals is to 'blame' for what happens as a result of that coalition. Indeed, placing blame is an enterprise that is inherently unproductive because it trivializes the problem: it distracts us into thinking that our problems are caused by the moral flaws of other people rather than focusing on how our political institutions encourage socially costly coalitions. ([Calomiris and Haber(2015)] p 213)
 deals are intended to improve the welfare of the members of those coalitions and of the group in control of the government, not of society at large. Because the economic incentives of the bank insiders, minority shareholders, depositors, debtors, and taxpayers are not inherently aligned, the group in control of the government has ample reason to exploit those di erences in incentives for its own political or economic ends. In particular, participants in the bargaining know that unanimity is not required for a deal to be made: the government simply has to cobble together a winning coalition. This situation implies that many parties may be excluded from beneficial deals. ([Calomiris and Haber(2015)] p 38)
# 5.2 Unavoidable Risks In Banking
# Contents
# What Does A Bank Produce?

Output: debt contracts - IOUs payable to bank - loans

Input: also contracts - IOUs to depositors (checking account = loan)

Inherently unstable - subject to runs, crises of confidence, liquidity crises.

Walter Bagehot, "father of central banking", understood both the power and the risks of banking

A million [pounds] in the hands of a single banker is a great power… But the same sum scattered in tens and fifties through a whole nation is no power at all (Lombard Street 1873)

But in exact proportion to the power of this system is its delicacy I should hardly say too much if I said its danger. Only our familiarity blinds us to the marvelous nature of the system…. If any large fraction of that money really was demanded, our banking system and our industrial system too would be in great danger. (p 11)

# Digression On Liquidity Crises

An recurrent part of banking crises

What Henry Paulson covers in his book

A panic seized upon the public, such as had never been witnessed before: everybody begging for money - money - but money was hardly on any condition to be had. (London, 1825)

 terror reigned in the City, the banks were besieged, consols went down to 84 (London 1866)

Everyone wanted his money back. Burned by foolish speculation in Russia, investors were rejecting risk in any guise, even reasonable risk (New York, 1998)

# Fundamental Issue: Inherently Unstable

Two unavoidable risks - puts depositors at risk

- Credit
(solvency) Risk: borrowers may default
- Liquidity Risk: timing mismatch, can push to insolvency
Natural solution: bu ers and cushions:
- Cash on asset side, equity capital on liability side
Equity capital:
- Owners & shareholders put money in to get profit.
- But at risk of loss
# Managing Solvency & Liquidity Risks - Bu Ers

Two unavoidable risks in banking: Credit

(Solvency) & Liquidity

- Credit
(solvency) risk: loans or other business goes bad
- Liquidity risk: depositors (or other lenders) want money back now
Protection against both: Capital & Liquidity Bu ers
(Reserves) - Solvency problem: Assets $<$ Liabilities
- Liquidity problem: Not enough liquid assets to pay depositors who ask today
Consider these two banks - LEFT: Safe, RIGHT: Not Safe
FIRST bad solvency news (loans fall by $7\%$ )
Solvency - loans down $7\%$, can bank still pay depositors?
- Left: lots of equity, lots of cash - solvent, assets > liabilities
- Assets don't go down too much (more reserves, safer assets)
Equity enough to absorb losses - owners lose but depositors OK
- Right: less equity, less cash - insolvent, assets < liabilities
- Assets go down by more since assets more risky
Not enough equity - depositors lose
NEXT bad liquidity news (depositors want \$12)
Liquidity - depositors want \$12 back, can bank pay all depositors?
- Left: plenty of cash to pay depositors immediately - solvent, liquid
- Bank pays the \$12 out of cash reserves
- Right: not enough cash - solvent but illiquid
- Bank has enough assets (assets > liabilities) but not the right kind of assets
 - Depositors want \$12, bank can pay only \$10
-BANK RUN

# Equity Capital

Raise capital as part of business - bu er Fundamental conflict:

- Bank insiders need to bring in outsiders
(investors) - Outsiders need to ensure insiders don't steal (wild bets, embezzle)
- Issue of principle / agent or cash-flow rights versus control rights
Mechanisms to protect outside shareholders
- Partnership: insiders put wealth at risk - limits size
- Legal structures against fraud and embezzlement
- Limited liability - equity investors cannot lose more than they put in
- Ilc common now - early banks partnerships, 19thc 2x or 3x liability
Banks earliest limited liability companies
# Government Power & Value Of "Bank Charter"

Government power critical for banking

- Laws to control fraud, enforce Ilc
- Various rights - eg to issue notes or money
- Obligations - eg pay taxes, be supervised
These laws, rights, obligations are the "Bank Charter" that C&H talk about Valuable – Source of "Economic Rents" or Property Rights
- Incentive for the government and insiders to limit charters
- Government can extract rents from the bank
- Insiders (and shareholders) can extract monopoly or scarcity rents from customers
I. Start with what a bank produces
(A) Output: debt contracts - IOUs payable to bank - loans made to businesses and individuals
(B) Input: also contracts - IOUs to depositors. (Remember - when you put money into a checking account your are lending to the bank)
(C) Banking is inherently unstable, even under the best of circumstances subject to runs, crises of confidence, liquidity crises.
II. Digression on Walter Bagehot, the "father of central banking". He wrote Lombard St. in 1873.
(A) On the power of a bank, that aggregates savings:
A million [pounds] in the hands of a single banker is a great power… But the same sum scattered in tens and fifties through a whole nation is no power at all (p 2 or 3)
(B) Bagehot again:
But in exact proportion to the power of this system is its delicacy I should hardly say too much if I said its danger. Only our familiarity blinds us to the marvelous nature of the system. There never was so much borrowed money collected in the world as is now collected in London. Of the many millions in Lombard street, infinitely the greater proportion is held by bankers or others on short notice or on demand; that is to say, the owners could ask for it all any day they please: in a panic some of them do ask for some of it. If any large fraction of that money really was demanded, our banking system and our industrial system too would be in great danger. (p 11)
III. Digression on Liquidity crisis:
(A) This is what Henry Paulson describes in the chapters I'm having you read from his book. His description of being in the middle of a liquidity crisis or panic
(B) Some quotes
"A panic seized upon the public, such as had never been witnessed before: everybody begging for money - money - but money was hardly on any condition to be had."
Referring to the London panic of 1825, reference given in fn 57 of Kindleberger as "Thomas Joplin, 'Case for Parliamentary Inquiry into the Circumstances of the Panic, in a letter to Thomas Gisbourne, Esq. M. P.' (London: F. Rigeway & Sons, n.d. [after 1832]), pp0.14-15."
"On May 10,1866, the great London discount house of Overend, Gurney & Co. had stopped payments; its liabilities were almost nineteen million pounds. The following day, England's Black Friday, 'terror reigned in the City, the banks were besieged, consols went down to 84,' reports Sir John Clapham, historian of the Bank of England." Wechsberg p. 137) Kindleberger says preceding speculation was in Cotton, shipping in general.
Everyone wanted his money back. Burned by foolish speculation in Russia, investors were rejecting risk in any guise, even reasonable risk (Lowenstein, "When Genius Failed" p 153)
IV. Fundamental issue with banking: inherently unstable (subject to runs, crises of confidence, liquidity crises).
(A) Two unavoidable risks
1. Credit
(solvency) Risk: borrowers may default
2. Liquidity Risk: timing mismatch
(B) This put depositors at risk
(C) Natural solution: bu ers and cushions: some cash on asset side, some equity capital on liability side
3. Slides on liquidity vs credit
(solvency) risk
(D) Equity capital: owners & shareholders, who put money in to get profit. But at risk of loss
V. Equity Capital: Banks need to raise capital to function (as part of the two bu ers - liquidity & capital)
(A) but this raises a fundamental conflict:
4. Bank insiders (initial owners and managers) need to bring in outsiders
5. Outsiders need some way to ensure insiders don't steal the equity capital (and deposits) by taking wild bets or embezzling
6. Issue of principle / agent or cash-flow rights (the right to receive profits and cash flows) versus control rights
(B) Mechanisms to protect outside shareholders
7. Make insiders put large wealth at risk in the business
8. Legal structures against fraud and embezzlement
9. Limited liability - so that equity investors cannot lose more than they put in i. We think limited liability is natural, but early banks were often partnerships ii. And in 19th c, often 2x or 3x liability iii. Banks were earliest limited liability companies
10. Limited liability is one of the keys. But this is granted by the government i. Only the government has the power to grant various rights (to issues notes or money; allow the bank to hold government or other deposits; limited liability) and obligations (eg pay taxes, be supervised) ii. These rights are the "Bank Charter" that C&H talk about
11. Bank Charters are valuable i. Incentive for the government and insiders to limit charters ii. Government can extract rents from the bank iii. Insiders (and shareholders) can extract monopoly or scarcity rents from customers
# 5.3 Three Property-Rights Challenges
# Contents
# Three Property-Rights Challenges

Temptations to expropriate

(steal) Need mechanisms to reduce risk of expropriation, or compensate for risk

Government expropriation

- Reduce: constrains government - better banking and higher growth
Compensate: bankers will extract rents from shareholders and customers - worse banking and lower growth
- Insider expropriation:
- minority shareholders and depositors need mechanisms to prevent insiders from stealing (fraud, tunneling)
- Borrower Expropriation:
- Through default, borrowers take from insiders, shareholders, depositors tunneling - channeling bank money towards businesses owned by insiders)
# 5.4 Conflicted Government
# Contents
# Government Conflicts

Government has a stake - cannot be "honest broker"

Regulates, but often wants profitable banks (taxes or kick-backs)

- Make charters scarce - valuable - generate revenue
- Maybe political pressure groups have influence, voting their interests
Nothing evil, just people and groups acting in their own best interest
Various source of
(potential) conflict
- Gov't taxes or borrows from banks, so incentive to make banks profitable (at expense of social welfare - stable & e cient banking)
Gov't enforces debt contracts, but debtors are voters, may punish gov't
- Gov't allocates losses (insiders, shareholders, depositors, borrowers)
- In a democracy voters are depositors and borrowers, may punish gov't
BAILOUTS: Incentives for gov't
(politicians) to bail out
- Depositors who are not careful (deposit insurance schemes)
- Borrowers who take on debt and try to walk away (think 2008)
# Political "Bargains"

Institutions, procedures, laws, rules, regulations result from political "bargains" between competing groups – politicians, bankers, investors, depositors, tax-payers, voters.

 deals are intended to improve the welfare of the members of those coalitions and of the group in control of the government, not of society at large. Because the economic incentives of the bank insiders, minority shareholders, depositors, debtors, and taxpayers are not inherently aligned, the group in control of the government has ample reason to exploit those differences in incentives for its own political or economic ends. In particular, participants in the bargaining know that unanimity is not required for a deal to be made: the government simply has to cobble together a winning coalition. This situation implies that many parties may be excluded from beneficial deals. (p 38)

# Bleak View

Bleak view of banking and finance

But note: not a "blame game"

Indeed, placing blame is an enterprise that is inherently unproductive because it trivializes the problem: it distracts us into thinking that our problems are caused by the moral flaws of other people rather than focusing on how our political institutions encourage socially costly coalitions. (p 213)

Nor hopeless - Chapter 15 talks about how to reform

Readers should not mistake our unvarnished appreciation for the realities and ironies of the political world, and the virtues of bank regulatory reform, as cynicism or hopelessness. (p 505)

# 6 Taxonomy Of Regimes & Banking
# Contents
# Autocracy

Response to risk of gov't expropriation: control or compensate

Autocracy: cannot control. Must compensate An establishment of this sort [Banque Generale] may be good in itself; but it is only so in a republic or a monarchy like England, whose finances are controlled by those alone who furnish them, and who only furnish as much as they please. But in a State which is weak, changeable, and absolute, like France, stability must necessarily be wanting to it; since the King, or in his name a mistress, a minister or favorites, or still more, such extreme necessities as we find in the years 1707-1710, may overthrow the Bank - the temptation to which would be too great, and at the same time too easy. Duc de Saint-Simon (contemporary - quoted in Macdonald)

Differences depending on degree of central control

- Strong: stable but narrow - share rents
(Mexico) - Weak: Inflation tax - Brazil
# Democracy

Gov't expropriation risk much reduced

Debtors have political voice

Inflation taxation rare (voters won't agree)

Distinction between "Liberal"

(Representative) vs Populist Democracy. Liberal or Representative: voters choose representatives, let them make decisions - Ancillary institutions (multicameral legislatures, political parties, independent judi ciary)

Populist: Rousseauian popular will - Voters are right and should not be opposed Referendums

(Brexit) # Outcomes Liberal

(Representative) Vs Populist

Populism tends to give power to the majority

In the liberal conception [of democracy], freedom is enjoyed by individuals and is defined by the absence of tyranny; in the populist conception, freedom means the ability to use government to implement the collective will of the people. (p 55) an ironic fact about popular sovereignty [populism]: democracies that least constrain the political power of majority rule tend to disadvantage the majority. (p 494)

Populism tends towards politically determined credit – bailouts, housing policy (lead-up to sub-prime crisis)

Liberal

(Representative) : Broad credit, stable - Canada

Populist: Broad credit, unstable - US

# Government Debt & Default

Lecture 4

Thomas S. Coleman

29 March 2023; Draft April 2,2023

# Discussion

Last week:

I. Regarding the Reinhard & Rogo reading (Chapter 1 "Varieties of Crises", on Library reserve):

Of the crises defined by quantitative thresholds and those defined by historical events (in Reinhart & Rogo), select one to describe briefly in class. Is there a historical example of this type of crisis that you would like to explore further? Why?

II. From the Kindleberger readings (Chapters 2 & 3, on Library Reserve):

Name the five stages in Minsky's model (From Kindleberger). Minsky's model usually revolves around one country. Explain how a shock in a single country can impact other countries. Provide examples from the readings.

This week:

I. Considering Calomiris & Haber,

How do di erent government regimes influence banking systems? Provide examples.

II. From Sargent's "US Then, Europe Now":

In your own words, briefly describe Sargent's central argument. What are the key factors / historical events that Sargent notes in support of this argument? Is there any event that you would like to learn more about?

Federal: e.g. Fannie & Freddie

- When taken over (2008) GSE obligations $\sim$ 5tn, vs $9.5tn public debt
- State & Local: e.g. pension liabilities

- The South Sea Bubble, the Mississippi Scheme, and the US 1790 transformation are all about one of the biggest issues in modern macroeconomics: the proper role and the appropriate level of government debt
- We have a number of issues to discuss before turning to details about the South Sea, Mississippi, and US 1790
- Start by looking at some of the modern issues and data concerning government debt
- What is government debt? Not so simple a question
- Explicit central-government debt.
Government issues bonds
(borrows) and promises to pay back on an agreed schedule. This is a promise to pay back out of future tax and other revenue.
Classic purpose: For funding unusual and generally short-term expenditures. Two classic examples: wars and (more recently) social spending during recessions.
Wars obvious: large expenditures for army and armaments, in what is intended to be short-term
Recessions: things like unemployment-insurance payments go up during a recession
Maintaining smooth government revenues
(taxation) in the face of sharp increases or decreases in expenditure
Modern markets are both short-term (US T-Bills) and longer-term (US T-Notes and US T-Bonds)
T-Bills 3,6,12 months. Borrow $99 today, pay back $100 in 12 months (no add-on interest - embedded in the discount at sale).
 T-Notes & T-Bonds – conceptually the same but for some obscure reason di erent legal names. Sell for $100 today, promise
(say) 3% interest ($3 per year, $1.50 every half-year), then $100 at stated maturity. T-Notes 2yr, 3yr, 5yr, 10yr. T-Bonds 30-yr.
Distribution of marketable securities by current maturity (Sep 30,2017):
[1] S14,176bn total, from https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/feddebt/feddebt_ann2017.pdf.
0-4yrs $8,388bn or 59%
4-10yrs $3,845bn or 27%
10+yrss1,943bnor $14 \%$
T-Bonds used to be "callable" – after 20yrs the government had the option to redeem the bonds at $100. This meant that if interest rates were really high (and the prices were low) then the gov't would do nothing. BUT if rates were really low (current rates below the bond coupon so the bond would be valuable and prices would be high) the government could redeem and then re-fund itself at the new lower rates. US gov't doesn't do this anymore but they did 30 years ago and we will see that this option to redeem was vitally important and one of the central driving forces in the South Sea Bubble.
Most governments worldwide have the same structure
- Explicit state and local government debts
For US, the "Muni Bond Market".
States and cities borrow to finance both current expenditures and capital spending (things like roads and bridges).
Repay out of future tax and other revenue
For US S&L borrowing, have both "General Obligation" bonds which pay out of general taxes and have first priority, and special revenue bonds where the borrowing goes to a special purpose (say building a hospital or a toll road) and the repayment is out of revenue from that project.
Again, classic purpose is to maintain smooth revenue
(taxation) in face of non-smooth expenditures
# - Implicit Central Government Obligations Or Debt

Implicit obligations where money is not borrowed and spent explicitly but rather implicitly. When problems occur the government may be tempted or obligated to pay some or all of the obligations. Commonly referred to as "bailing out…"

The classic example for federal would be Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We will encounter them when we talk about the subprime crisis but we might as well be introduced now. These were (and are) government sponsored enterprises

(GSEs) which were supposed to be private corporations but with some government benefits. One of the benefits was the presumption that if they got into trouble the US government would bail them out. Politicians said this wouldn't happen but nobody believed them, and in 2008 the government did bail them out, guaranteeing their debt and in e etc making it an obligation of the US government and thus US taxpayers.

The onor o -balance sheet obligations of the two GSEs, which are "independent" corporations rather than federal agencies, are just over $5 trillion, a significant amount when compared to the $9.5 trillion of o cially reported United States public debt at the time of the takeover. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_takeover_of_Far referencing Barr, Colin (2008-09-07). "Paulson readies the bazooka: Big buyers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt have been shying away. The Treasury secretary wants to coax them back". Fortune. Retrieved 2008-09-08. Seems to be at http://archive.fortune.com/2008/09/06/news/economy/fannie_freddie_paulson.fortune/index.htm?p

For China this is a really big issue. There are State Owned Enterprises

(SOEs) , state banks, "shadow banks" all of which have large but opaque or unknown obligations which the central government may feel obligated to make good on. [Weinland and Wildau(2016)]

# - Implicit Local Government Obligations Or Debt

For US state and local governments this is a huge issue

Shows up largely in "unfunded pension obligations": promises to pay retirement benefits to current or past state and local employees, but without putting money into the retirement fund today to cover future obligations.

Illinois is one of the states with the biggest problems (but only 2nd-worst - New Jersey is worst).

From https://www.statedatalab.org/state_data_and_comparisons/detail/illinois

Total state liabilities (2016): $236bn of which bonds: $40bn

 Other liabilities: $28bn j Minus debt related to capital assets: -$15bn

 Unfunded pension benefits: $138bn

 Unfunded retiree health care: $44bn

Per taxpayer $50,400

Also Retirement debt (2017) – Total $203bn From https://www.illinoispolicy.org/reports/203-billion-and-counting-total-debt-for-state-and-local-retirement-benefits-in-illinois/

In many respects this acts like explicit government debt except that it is not properly accounted for.

This has a direct connection with the US 1790 events. Part of the "grand bargain" of the 1789 Constitution was the federal government explicitly taking over state debts

(bailing out" the states). Later, by the 1830s, states had accumulated new debts, and this time the federal government refused to take over or assume the debts – states defaulted and investors lost. BUT this pushed many states to write "balanced budget" conditions into their state constitutions. One way to view the implicit (say pension) liabilities is a way politicians can work around those balanced budget provisions by taking on implicit obligations that are not explicitly accounted for as debt.

But the Congress's decision not to bail out the states [in the 1840s] had other, arguably more beneficial consequences for the country. A legacy of the Congress's decision was that in the 1840s more than half of the U. S. states rewrote their state constitutions to require year-by-year balanced budgets. This is yet another example of fiscal crises that have produced the lasting institutional changes that we sometimes call revolutions. ([Sargent(2011)] p 26)

# Modern Bonds

Modern gov't debt almost always bonds (fixed maturity)

18th c government debt was always annuities - Perpetuities

- Modern - as in picture
- Fixed coupon, fixed maturity date
- Simple, transparent, standardized
- "Yield" or discount rate compares bonds
- Easy with computers, harder in 1700s
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/b7c9b5a92767260a5c767ec6cfb9a69c69a24c39e6310407df182102b53a6631.jpg)
# Yield - How Much You Earn

Givesthe right answer (goes up)when either coupon up or price down

- Higher coupon: good
- Lower price: good
Yield: balances the two. Example of 10yr bond, $1.5\%$ coupon, price $100
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/83f967d14a0bfa60c7fad6f0d2896ab8c6e84c8870a62499d0e50854447b4d39.jpg)

Yield up (you earn more) when coupon up or price down
Coupon to $2.50 or Price to $91.25 yield to 2.50%
Of course, when you already own bond higher yield not good
# Rentes & British Perpetuals

(Consols) French perpetual annuities, British Redeemable Perpetual Annuities

Most gov't debt at this time perpetual annuities

- Fixed coupon (per year)
- Never pay back principal
- Simple Valuation:
$$
\begin{array}{l} - \operatorname{PV} (\mathbf {S x} \text{annuity} @ \mathbf {y} \%) = \mathbf {x} / \mathbf {y} \\ - \mathrm{PV} (\S 5 @ 6 \%) = 5 / 0.06 = \$ 83.30 \\ \end{array}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/a281924b6f3c774029c759dcf6346f89ea5ac683189897d8dbd097722772f0e4.jpg)

discount at y%

Let's see how valuation works:

1710: "interest on majority of rents issued since 1702 reduced to $5\%$

- Originally $6 \%$
- Prior to 1710: Lend 100 litres, get 6 litres: ${100} = 6/y = > y = 6\%$
- In 1710: PV(5 litres @ $6\%$ ) = 5 / 0.06 = 83.3 litres
Example of "haircut" - partial default
I. During 18th c France had some perpetuals (discredited from the the Mississippi bubble in 1720) but mainly a mish-mash of term loans with quirks, and life annuities. Hard to value, hard to trade, expensive. ([Macdonald(2006)] p 244)
(A) After 1720, aversion to issue perpetuals (which was the instrument other nations used). Insisted on specified repayment. So no simple perpetuals. Which meant issues could not be substituted - each issue unique and idiosyncratic.
(B) Usury limit: Fundamental problem for France - usury limit of $5\%$, but lenders demanded higher than $5\%$ for all the reasons discussed here (poor credit, illiquid market). So often France would issue at a discount. (Remember, if you buy a bond at a discount then the e-ective interest is higher. Say 5l coupon for a perpetuity. If $\mathrm{Prc} = 100$, $100 = \mathrm{PV}(5\mathrm{l} \text{@ } 5\%) = 5 / 0.05$. But if $\mathrm{Prc} = 70$, $70 = \mathrm{PV}(5\mathrm{l} \text{@ } 7.14\%) = 5 / 0.0714$. Lenders were smart enough to know this, and it was a cute way around the $5\%$ usury limit.)
(C) Life annuities (rentes viagères, Macdonald p. 244): this was the biggest part of French borrowing ("after 1771 they dominated public borrowing" p 244). But horrible for making a deep & liquid market. The annuity would die with the buyer (would it redeem or simply disappear? I'm not sure). Taking idiosyncrasy of issues to the nth-degree: how could anyone trade a life annuity because it would depend on the life expectancy of the seller. Adam Smith in Wealth of Nations: "No man will give for an annuity upon the life of another, whose age and state of health are nearly the same as his own, the same price that he would give for one upon his own… It can never, therefore, make so convenient a transferrable stock as a perpetual annuity, of which the real value may be supposed always the same, or very nearly the same." (Book 5,3, p. 7)
# British Redeemable Perpetuals - Consols

Britain had Redeemable Perpetual Annuities

(Consols) until 2015

- "Consolidated Stock" or "Consolidated Annuities"
- Originally issued 1750s to consolidate earlier issues, finally retired 2015
- Fixed coupon (per year), never pay back principal
- BUT, key feature, redeemable at £100
Two issues around redemption:
I. Gov't not tied to high coupon forever
- Eg £4 annuity, rates to 3, PV = £4/0.03 = £133
Gov't could "redeem" and convert coupon to £3 (£3/0.03= £100)
II. In 1720 South Sea conversion of iredeemables key
# My Consols

I know Consols well

- I bought $4\%$ Consols in 1990s.
Gov't had right to redeem at £100. I was annoyed
Rates in 2015 were about $2.5\%$
$$
\mathrm{PV} = 4 /. 025 = £ 160
$$
- You can see why I was annoyed - redeemed at £100
I. England had Consols (redeemable perpetuals) - every issue the same, freely tradeable, transparent market, low rates
(A) Consols first issued
1751. In 1752 all outstanding redeemables converted into $3.5\%$ Consolidated Stock
1752. According to Macdonald (p. 244) originally $\mathbb{£}9\mathrm{mn}$, by 1780s $\mathbb{£}100\mathrm{mn}$. Large, liquid market.

Debt-to-GDP Ratio for US, UK & Japan
- Debt-to-GDP ratio - the way debt is always discussed.
- This is not perfect - it compares a stock (dollar amount of debt outstanding at a point in time) with a flow (GDP - value of goods and services produced during a year). But it does serve the purpose of calibrating or normalizing the size of the debt to the size of the economy.
- We could also look at debt per-capita (per person) but Debt-to-GDP is the standard way – at least for central gov't debt
- Huge debates (to which we turn shortly) about how much is "too much" debt. These debates have been raging for centuries
There was a high-level financial policy debate of sorts in the mid-1790s. On one side was Albert Gallatin, a Republican congressman from western Pennsylvania and future treasury secretary in the Jeerson and Madison administrations. Gallatin was the Republican opposition's financial expert, a role that corresponded to Hamilton's role in the Federalist Party. [Sylla(2010), 74]
Like other Republican leaders, Gallatin thought most public debts were bad, and his principal charge against Hamilton's policies was that the assumption of state debts in 1790 had made the national debt larger than it needed to be by at least $10.9 million. [Sylla(2010), 75]
Gallatin closed his Sketch with a challenge to the view that the debt funding plan "had created a large productive capital which did not exist before." His view was that "every nation is enfeebled by a public debt," and that the best policy was to extinguish public debt as quickly as it was feasible to do so by cutting spending and increasing taxes. He lamented the fact that foreign investors had purchased so much of the U. S. debt and other American securities, which only led the American sellers "to consume, to spend more, and they have consumed and spent extravagantly."
Taking in the great number of elegant houses which have been built within a few years in all the large cities, and which, however convenient to the inhabitants, a ord no additional revenue to the nation, it may be asserted that the greater part of the capital thus drawn from Europe for purchases of stock has been actually consumed, without leaving in its stead any other productive capital, and thus as the nation still owes the whole, it has been impoverished even by the only consequence of the funding system that has made any temporary addition to the apparent wealth of the country. That wealth is, in a great degree, consumed and destroyed, and the whole debt remains to be paid. (Adams 1960, III, 149)
Substitute China for Europe in this passage, and Gallatin's message would seem rather similar to arguments one often hears today, more than two centuries later. Other passages in his essay indicate that he would subscribe to "crowding out"—the idea that public borrowing and spending reduces private investment—as well as Ricardian equivalence—the notion that people react to increases in public debt by increasing their savings in order to be able to pay the increased taxes necessary to service a larger public debt. [Sylla(2010), 79]
- Following the 2008 financial crisis government debt ratios increased dramatically and there were, and are, huge debates about the benefits or dangers of government debt.
- The US went from $40 - 50\%$ prior to the Bush administration and roughly $60\%$ for the Bush administration, up to roughly $100\%$ following the 2008 crisis
- The UK went from roughly $45\%$ up to $100\%$ following the 2008 crisis.

# 2 Government Debt Default

Default on government debt is both common and highly disruptive

# 2.1 History

Default on government debt has been common throughout history. Modern developed nations defaulted regularly during their transformation into modern states.

Britain didn't default 18th c (or 19th c). France defaulted 18th, Spain 19th

# I. History On Defaults
#

(A) Development Of Debt Markets

1. We discussed Britain & France in 18th c
2. Britain developed a functioning debt market during and in spite of the South Sea Bubble (1720s)
 i. Parliament provided the political mechanism that controlled the temptation for the government to expropriate
(steal) from borrowers ii. Britain converted all the funny debt (lottery, irredeemables) into transparent, standardized, simple redeemable annuities. Eventually Consols (1751) iii. Bank of England served as the intermediary that could both process the borrowing and lending (things like lending very short-term, backed by its own capital, against taxes) and also monitor and manage the government's debt service.
3. France, in contrast, did not develop a well-functioning debt market for another hundred years or more.
 i. No elective and long-lived institution that could discipline the monarchy ii. All kinds of non-transparent and expensive debt (life annuities, lotteries, small and non-interchangeable issues) iii. No smoothly-functioning market trading standardized bonds
(B) Dierences between Britain & France
(C) Show up in the debt the countries could sustain
4. The financial positions of France and Britain in 1788 ([Macdonald(2006), 241]).

``` i. Britain could support more debt (£245mn vs £183mn) – lenders believed they would pay back and therefore were willing to lend ii. Britain did not have to pay such high interest rates - again lenders believed Britain was less risk and so charged a lower risk premium
2. This reflects the lower risk premium and better reputation of Britain versus France. This better reputation was earned in multiple ways.
 i. A market with simple, liquid, interchangeable instruments ii. A proven track-record of paying debts (refraining from default) iii. Better financial management, including transparency and publication of annual public accounts ([Macdonald(2006)] p. 232)

5. I think Britain did partially default in the 1670s but on domestic rather than foreign debt. (See [Macdonald(2006), 170] - "In January 1672 Charles decided to stop payment on the receipts… Charles continued to pay $5\%$ interest from time to time on the principal. James reneged on even this commitment, but in 1703 the debt was reinstated at $50\%$ of its old value. It thus became the first, albeit involuntary, component of the long-term national debt.") But not since then
6. France just defaulted willy-nilly. 1701,1715,1770,1788. Also 1812.

# Corporate Vs Sovereign Default

Corporate Default & Bankruptcy

- Transfer of ownership
- Bankruptcy is a beautiful thing - allows firms to make mistakes
- But depends on national laws - legal ownership & transfer
Sovereign Default
- State refuses to pay
- But creditors cannot take ownership
- In general - except see Newfoundland 1928-1933 (R&R p. 81)
- "sovereign but bankrupt Newfoundland absorbed by Canada"
# Why Do Sovereigns Ever Repay?

Why don't nations always default? Debtors cannot take ownership.

Eaton & Gersovitz - benefits of continued borrowing (R&R p 54-58)

Sovereigns repay so can borrow in the future

- "countries may need to borrow to fight recessions…"
# Why Do Sovereigns Ever Repay?

Actually, countries borrow to wage war - look at US

(A) Autocracy - absolute monarchy like in France - too large a temptation to steal from lenders. Even recognized at the time
An establishment of this sort may be good in itself; but it is only so in a republic or a monarchy like England, whose finances are controlled by those alone who furnish them, and who only furnish as much as they please. But in a State which is weak, changeable, and absolute, like
France, stability must necessarily be wanting to it; since the King, or in his name a mistress, a minister or favorites, or still more, such extreme necessities as we find in the years 1707-1710, may overthrow the Bank - the temptation to which would be too great, and at the same time too easy.

(B) Popular Democracy - voting uncovers "the popular will" and this popular will (the will of the people) must be followed. This is an idea that came later than England and Parliament in
30. Risk that this kind of democracy can itself impose a tyranny of the majority. As Calomiris & Haber say, "an ironic fact about popular sovereignty: democracies that least constrain the political power of majority rule tend to disadvantage the majority." (p 494)
(C) "Liberal" or Representative Democracy - voting elects representatives, who then make decisions until the next election, when they may be kicked out. Representative democracy traces back to the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the new-found power of Parliament to act as a constraint on tyranny. One of the particular constraints was constraint on the King to tax and spend. Since Parliament and MPs were both in charge of the government and themselves lenders, they internalized the costs and benefits of expropriation from lenders.
II. Reinhart & Rogo 's discussion of "Serial Default", "Debt Intolerance", "Serial Default Graduation"
(A) Two points we need to make
31. Knowing the history of defaults is absolutely necessary for understanding macroeconomics and financial crises. We need to know the behavior countries and be suspicious of debt and borrowing
32. But "Serial Default" and "Debt Intolerance" (p 28) are symptoms of more fundamental causes when people want to understand the factors that shape complex systems and shift those systems from one equilibrium to another, they undertake multidimensional analysis—and one of the dimensions on which they focus intently is time. This is what a physician does, for example, when she is faced with a di cult diagnosis. She starts with fundamental, time-invariant factors, such as the patient's genetic predisposition toward particular diseases as deduced from a family medical history. ([Calomiris and Haber(2015)] p 25)
(B) For example, R&R categorize countries by IIR rating & debt-to-GDP ratio (p 27 - 29)
33. Use IIR (Institutional Investor Review) ratings to classify into 3 categories:
 i. Club A - high IIR rating, most access to capital markets, least debt intolerant ii. Club B - medium IIR rating, some access to capital markets, medium debt intolerant. Further split by debt-to-GDP ratio iii. Club C - low IIR rating, little-or-no access to capital markets
34. This use of data is valuable - shows us some of the characteristics across time and across countries - but misses the point that both debt tolerance and IIR ratings are results of some other unobserved characteristic.
(C) Serial-default nations are failed or struggling nations. R&R talk about "serial default" as a state that a nation can fall into or graduate from ("once a country slips into being a serial defaulter." p 29). Although this is useful as a first view of the data, we need a deeper understanding of the causes and mechanisms that lead to default. C&H's framework of property rights, rent-seeking, self-interested political coalitions, and financial systems subject to expropriation by various parties, is more fruitful.
(D) The more fundamental causes are the underlying property rights and political institutions. Serial default and debt intolerance persist because the political structures (the underlying property rights) change slowly. But debt repayment and debt default levels are results, not causes.

# "Growth In A Time Of Debt"

High debt ratio associated with low growth

- "Growth in a Time of Debt" - 2010 American Economic Review
- "Public Debt Overhangs" - 2012 Journal of Economic Perspectives
Reinhart & Rogo (2010) claim high debt ratio $(90\% +)$ associated with low growth
The paper argues that when "gross external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP", a country's annual growth declined by two percent, and "for levels of external debt in excess of 90 percent" GDP growth was "roughly cut in half."
# Problems With "Growth In A Time Of Debt"

Some minor problems:

"While using RR's working spreadsheet, we identified coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics." (Herndon, Ash Pollin, 2013, in Cambridge Journal of Economics

Reinhart & Rogo "Public Debt Overhangs: Advanced-Economy Episodes since 1800" (JEP 2012)

- Look at growth during $< {90}\% \& > {90}\%$
- Again, problems with data

Politicians, commentators, and activists widely cited the paper in political debates over the effectiveness of austerity in fiscal policy for debt-burdened economies. (See https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/opinion/debt-growth-and-the-austerity-debate.html) The paper argues that when "gross external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP", a country's annual growth declined by two percent, and "for levels of external debt in excess of 90 percent" GDP growth was "roughly cut in half."

# "Serial Default" Is Symptom Of Deeper Issues

Debt intolerance is a syndrome in which weak institutional structures and a problematic political system make external borrowing a tempting device for governments to employ to avoid hard decisions about spending and taxing. (R&R Ch 2)

What makes a successful nation? Why do some nations fail and others succeed?

- These are deep and di cult issues in political philosophy, with contributions from Hobbes, Hume, Locke, Rousseau
- Recent important contributions from Daron Acemoglu & James Robinson - Why Nations Fail and The Narrow Corridor
- Also (less well-known) William Riker Liberalism Against Populism
- Focus on political and economic institutions, the rules and enforcement mechanisms that exist in society
- Why Nations Fail: focuses on extractive vs inclusive institutions
- The Narrow Corridor: how liberty and freedom follows from shackling Hobbes's Leviathan (the all-powerful state), requiring on-going race between the state and civil society
# Our Focus: 1) Democracy & Debt; 2) Banks & Political Institutions

We are going to focus now on debt and democracy, described in Macdonald's A Free Nation Deep in Debt

- Argues that democracy and political freedom lead to national debt, and that debt was the tool that allowed democracies to flourish and triumph in the 18th-20th centuries
- We consider Britain and France in 1720, and then the US in 1790s
- The financial crises of 1720 and 1790s were associated with growth and transformation of government debt markets
- Britain transformed, took on debt. France did not. Britain triumphed
Later in the course we turn to banks and banking crises, and Calomiris & Haber's Fragile by Design
- Explanations for crises and fragility rooted in political and economic coalitions that shape banking institutions

# 4 Digressions
# 4.1 Short-Term ("Liquidity") Vs Long-Term ("Solvency") Issues
# Contents
# "Liquidity" Vs "Solvency"

Short-term: "Liquidity" or Roll-over Risk

Long-term: "Solvency" Risk

Example: Borrow $100

- Short-term: pay back $104, borrow another $100 each period
- Risks: 1) lenders decide not to re-lend $100; 2) cannot pay $4
- Long-term (perpetual annuity): pay back $4 each year
- Risk: cannot pay $4
Trade-o: short-term usually lower rates:
US 1yr: $1.08\%$
- US 30yr: $2.99\%$

# Short-Term Vs Long-Term

This was problem with Argentina in

1888. In November 1888 a £3.5 million ering of the Buenos Ayres [sic] Drainage and Waterworks Company failed, and Barings felt obliged to lend to Argentina through acceptance credits. Falling raw materials prices in 1890 made it impossible for the Argentine government to meet these credits as they came due. (Kindleberger p. 122)

Lenders might prefer short-term - to force borrowers to behave

Why would borrowers want short-term?

Short-term rates usually lower rates:

US 1yr: $1.08\%$ US 30yr: $2.99\%$

Britain in 1700s: short-term debt to finance wars, then convert the debt to longer-term debt after each war's conclusion (R&R p 70)

US currently mainly short-term. Is this sensible?

I. Theory of why countries repay - ST debt & rollover risk

(A) Distinction between short-term rollover risk

(liquidity) vs long-term willingness to pay

(insolvency)

(B) Example of borrowing $100. Two possibilities

1889. Long-term – Annuity

(perpetuity) – pay back $4 each year forever. This was England in early 1700s

 1890. Short-term – one-year bond – pay-back $104 each year, borrowing $100 anew each time

(C) If have to re-borrow what happens when lenders decide not to

(D) This was problem with Argentina in

# 4.2 Default Vs Re-Scheduling
# Contents
# Default Vs Re-Scheduling

Default is non-payment, Re-Scheduling changing the terms

Economically the same

- Default: usually get something back
- Re-Scheduling: change the terms (eg lower coupon) - e-ective default
Greece oc ially launched a bond swap Friday [24-feb-2012], aiming to wipe 107 billion euros ($142 billion) o its 350-billion-euro debt bill. The debt write-down, also known as haircut, hits private investors hard.
As part of the deal [debt swap] - also known as a haircut - private creditors are asked to trade in their Greek bonds for new ones or erging lower interest rates and longer maturities [pushing the €100 principal further away].
France: reduced coupon on rentes
Britain: often reduced interest on Consols - but redeemable
Rates 3%, £4 annuity worth £133.
- Redeem for £100, re-issue new £3 annuity. Or just reduce to £3
I. Default vs restructuring. Re-scheduling
(A) p
61. Greece: "As part of the deal [debt swap] - also known as a haircut - private creditors are asked to trade in their Greek bonds for new ones or ering lower interest rates and longer maturities [pushing the €100 principal further away]. Bondholders are expected to take a nominal loss of $53.5\%$ on their holdings, which equates to a real loss of 73 to $74\%$." (web, http://www.dw.com/en/greek-creditors-receive-o cial-haircut-notification/a-15767530, early 2012) "Greece o cially launched a bond swap Friday [24-feb-2012], aiming to wipe 107 billion euros ($142 billion) o its 350-billion-euro debt bill. The debt write-down, also known as haircut, hits private investors hard."
(B) France: reduced coupons on rents - a form of re-scheduling and thus default
(C) Britain: often reduced coupon on Consols
62. But this is interesting - not a re-scheduling.
63. Consols redeemable annuities - callable at £100. Often the government would find it easier to have investors take a reduce coupon rather than redeem the existing bonds and then re-issue at new
(lower) coupon
 64. Rates 3%: Annuity of £4 is worth £4/0.03 = £133. Can redeem at £100, then re-issue new annuity at £3 coupon, worth £100.

# Credit Spread: Market Measure Of "Default"

# I. Digression On Credit Spreads

(A) Important point: default (or re-scheduling) does not mean investors are irrational or lose by investing in bonds that eventually default

1. Often investors receive a higher coupon or higher yield that compensates for the chance of default
2. Bonds, like any financial security, are simply a game of expectations - you pay today with some chance of getting money in the future.

(D) "Yield" correctly measures how much you earn - it trades of the lower price (you buy the bond cheaper) and higher coupon (you earn more each year).

3. Take the Brazil $12.50\%$ of 1/31/22. Very high coupon is good (earn a lot each year) but you have to pay a lot up-front ($111.029). Net you earn $9.49\%$
4. Still, this is much higher than for US go'$v_{t}$ bonds - similar maturity UST is the $1.875\%$ of 03/22 with yield of $1.81\%$. Spread of 768bp.

(E) Credit spread incorporates both the probability of the default and the value of the loss - how much investors are hurt by the loss.

5. Incorporates recovery – default usually does not mean you lose all $100

# Extraordinary Bubbles, Extraordinary Accomplishments South Sea Bubble

(England) And Mississippi Company

(France) Two of the most celebrated financial bubbles of all time

- Stories of panic and mania (Mackay - Extraordinary Popular Delusions)
But part of more fundamental social and political transformations
(Macdonald) - Building capacity for government debt and borrowing, and market to trade
- Britain successfully transformed, France did not
Britain's political system was open to transformation, France's was not
(from Velde 2007, about France): When the first proposal [for Law's bank] was discussed in 1715, royal advisers objected that a bank would never work under an absolute monarchy, because the king would always be tempted to raid the bank.
"Political economy" issues of political systems, property rights, rule of law

I. Considering Calomiris & Haber, How do di erent government regimes influence banking systems? Provide examples.

II. In your own words, briefly describe Sargent's central argument. What are the key factors / historical events that Sargent notes in support of this argument? Is there any event that you would like to learn more about?

# Debt Restructuring & Political Fight

Two stories:

I. Debt restructuring - debts from Nine Year's War (1688-97) & Wars of Spanish Succession (1702-1715)

- In 1717, England debt-to-GDP ratio about $80\%$
- In 1717 debt was mish-mash
- By 1721 debt was largely restructured and set on path for stability
II. Political fighting - 1719-1720
Bank of England - monopoly on managing gov't debt
- Whigs - new financial & merchant, urban interests
- South Sea Co trying to break Bank of England monopoly
- Tories - "old" landed aristocracy
- Sword Blade Bank
# What Happened: Short Version

Britain & South Sea bubble:

- South Sea Co. & Sword Blade Bank won competition to restructure debt
- Triggered a massive speculative bubble – largely supported by fraud
- Bubble and South Sea Co. collapsed, but debt had been restructured
- End result: stable gov't debt market, Bank of England agent
Contrast with France & Mississippi bubble:
John Law, Mississippi Co: restructuring French debt
- A bubble but not a fraud
- Law was truly innovative: gov't debt as "gov't equity"; paper money
- But after-e etc: no gov't debt market, France at disadvantage for 100yrs
Classic account - irrational bubbles: McKay & Kindleberger
Substantive account - building a stable gov't debt market: Macdonald & Velde
- Bank of England - monopoly on managing gov't debt
- Almost all the short-term debt (I think £2.5mn) plus redeemables from lottery loans (£16.5mn) plus its own £3.4mn of
(now) 5% annuities.
- This is about $47\%$ of total debt outstanding.
- The £2.5mn short-term plus £16.5mn redeemables was about $60\%$ of debt held by public
The South Sea Company had been founded by the Tories to overturn the Bank of England's increasing monopoly on government funding. But much to their irritation, after the initial success of the South Sea flotation, the Bank had resumed its progress. Harley's later lottery loans had been managed by the Bank, and it was now responsible for the redeemable $5 \%$ s which had been issued to refund them. By 1719 the Bank was responsible for managing almost the entire shortterm debt, as well as £16.5 million of redeemables and its own £3.4mn perpetual annuities. All this was in addition to its profitable private
# 1.1 South Sea & English Trading Cos
# Contents
# English Trading Cos

Trading Cos mixture of banking & business

- Trading Monopolies + Lending to Government
- Implicit bargain between trading companies and government
- Government wanted to borrow, o ered sweeteners in monopoly
Odd to our eyes, but normal in 1700
# Bank Of England, East India Co, South Sea Co

Bank of England, survived to today (much changed)

- founded 1694, monopoly on banking - private & gov't
- Monopoly rights that were gradually eroded through the 18th c
East India Co
- Founded 1600, monopoly on trade with India.
One of the most powerful entities in the world 19th c
South Sea Company:
- Founded 1711, monopoly South America trade
Trade virtually worthless - only value gov't annuities
I. Background on trading companies
II. Truly odd creatures to us. They were a combination of lenders to the government and trading monopolies.
(A) These just don't exist nowadays, or at least in developed countries.
III. Basically an implicit bargain, cooperation between trading companies and the government.
(A) In Britain, there was wide overlap between the government (MPs in Parliament) and the political classes (aristocracy, landed gentry, merchants).
(B) Much political conflict between parties (Tories landed gentry, Whigs merchants) but the power was dispersed throughout society
(C) This was critically important, as emphasized by Calomiris & Haber, Macdonald, Acemoglu & Robinson.
(D) Stark contrast with France, and I believe one of the key issues for why the financial transformation we are discussing was successful in England in 1720 and the US in 1792, but not in France in
1720. IV. The government wanted to borrow money from these companies
(A) The government granted exclusive trading rights or monopolies and borrowed from these companies
(B) An implicit bargain that the companies would lend (or give) money to the government in return for the privilege to trade.
(C) We can think of the trading rights, the trading monopolies, as sweeteners that induced the companies to lend to the government and lend at lower rates then they would otherwise
(D) To our minds this horribly mixes government borrowing and underlying trading business. But prior to 1720 that was the norm.
V. Three main companies we are concerned with - East India Co., Bank of England, South Sea Company
(A) Bank of England has survived to this day, although in a totally di erent form than we are examining in 1720
1721. founded 1694,2. monopoly on banking, banking to both the government (agent for buying and selling government debt) and private banking. Monopoly rights that were gradually eroded through the 18th c
(B) East India Co
1722. founded 1600,2. monopoly on trade with India. This was, obviously, a very valuable monopoly and probably made up the bulk of the company's value
(C) South Sea Company:
1723. founded 1711,2. monopoly on trading with South America - virtually worthless.
1724. The only value was in the government annuities it held.
# South Sea Co - No Underlying Business

Important to understand basic business of South Sea Co - none

- Right to trade with South America
Unless the Spaniards are to be divested of common sense… throwing away the only valuable stake they have left in the world, and in short, bent on their own ruin, we cannot suggest that they will ever part with so valuable, indeed so estimable a jewel, as the exclusive power of trade to their own plantations. (Daniel Defoe, quoted in Macdonald p. 207)
- "Gov't debt mutual fund" but no other underlying business
- Fight between South Sea Co and Bank of England
- Both bid for right to convert gov't debt
- South Sea Co won - with substantial outright bribery of MPs
- Bank of England bid stayed within reason - South Sea Co did not
# Comment On Daniel Defoe

Merchant, spy, novelist. Spent time in prison for political agitation and also for debts. And one of the great English novelists. Author of Robinson Crusoe, "second only to the bible in translations". Journal of the Plague Year, an amazing chronicle of the Great Plague of London in

1665. And one of my favorite novels, Moll Flanders - the story of the truly amoral but wonderful title character: "the fall and eventual redemption, both material and spiritual, of a lone woman in 17th-century England."

# Some Additional Thoughts On Britain & South Sea Co.
- Important to understand basic business of South Sea Co - none
- Right to trade with South America
But Spain controlled South America, and was never going to let England trade with its colonies
This was recognized at the time: Defoe
Unless the Spaniards are to be divested of common sense… throwing away the only valuable stake they have left in the world, and in short, bent on their own ruin, we cannot suggest that they will ever part with so valuable, indeed so estimable a jewel, as the exclusive power of trade to their own plantations. (quoted in [Macdonald(2006)] p. 207, reference to Carswell The South Sea Bubble 1993, p. 47)
- South Sea Co issued shares and bought gov't annuities
Before 1720, held £9.2mn of $6 \%$ annuities ([Macdonald(2006)] p 208)
Market rates $\sim 4\frac{1}{2} -5\%$: PV(£6 @ $4.6\%$ ) = £130
- "Gov't debt mutual fund" but no other underlying business
- Fight between South Sea Co and Bank of England
- Both bid for right to convert
- South Sea Co won - with substantial outright bribery of MPs
- Bank of England bid stayed within reason - South Sea Co did not
# 1.2 English Debt 1715,1717,1719
# Contents
# Restructuring Debt

In 1715, large debt, expensive, messy

- Debts from wars (Nine Years and Spanish Succession)
- Debt-to-GDP roughly $80\%$ - High by today's standards, horribly high for 1715
- Messy: Lottery loans, irredeemables
1717: Government had managed well enough rates down
- Could refinance some of the debt (Trading Co & Lottery). Not iredeemables
1719: Still trying to refinance iredeemables
- South Sea Co proposes plan to refinance irredeemables
- pure speculation
- Core of the bubble
# English Debt 1715 - Expensive Lottery & Irredeemables

End of wars. Four types of debt, some of it quirky and expensive

I. Perpetual Annuities - Redeemable & "cheap"

Held by trading cos (East India $5\%$, BoE & SS $6\%$

- From medieval usury laws, automatically redeemable at option of borrower
- Option meant government could refinance when rates improved
II. Lottery Loans - expensive (& quirky by modern standards)
- £6 annuity (6%) for 32 years, but at end get £0 or £100
- £0, Annuity: 77 = PV(£6 annuity @ y = 6.86%)
- £100, Bond: 77 = PV(£6 bond @ y = 8%)
- Expensive - could be redeemed, but at £100
- Redeem at 15yrs @ £100: 77 = PV(£6 15yr bond @ y = 8.82%)
III. £12.6mn "irredeemables" - 32yr & 99yr annuities - expensive
- With fixed end, not automatically redeemable
- For financing, 99yrs as good as forever
- Expensive - maybe $6.67\%$, but could not redeem and lower rate
- Center-piece of South Sea Bubble - exchanging this expensive debt was a major motivation for 1720 activity

And Heav'n be prais'd \ It is easily rais'd…

1715. Generally, debt was a mess of different types (and expensive) [Macdonald(2006), 186]:

\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

I. GNP roughly $60mn. Total debt £49mn. Debt-to-GDP roughly 80%.

II. Much in annuities

(perpetuals) : £16.4mn. Held by trading cos:

	- East India Co (5% annuities)

	- Bank of England (6% annuities) (was this £3.4mn? Sounds like it from Macdonald p 208)

	- South Sea Company (6% annuities) (£9.2mn? Seems to be from Macdonald p 208)

(A) These trading companies are odd creatures to us. They were a combination of lenders to the government and trading monopolies.

(B) At this period – before 1715 – the government wanted to borrow money but when those companies were founded the government had to offer sweeteners of valuable trading monopolies to lower the interest rates

III. £11.4 mn Lottery loans - unusual

(quirky) by modern standards:

£6 annuity (6%) for 32 years

	- Issued at discount - £77 - only got £77 for the loans

	- Discount meant that it was more expensive - more valuable to the investor which was needed at the time to induce investors to lend to the government

	- At end, get zero

(annuity) or £100

(bond) , determined by lottery

	- Annuity: $77 = \mathrm{PV}(\mathbf{\Phi}$ 6 annuity @ y = 6.86%)

	- Bond: ${77} =$ PV(£6 bond @ y = 8%)

	- Expensive - could be redeemed, but at £100

	- Redeem at 15yrs @ £100: 77 = PV(£6 15yr bond @ y = 8.82%)

IV. £12.6mn "irredeemables" - 32yr & 99yr annuities

	- Expensive - maybe $6.67\%$, but could not redeem and lower rate

	- Center-piece of South Sea Bubble - exchanging this expensive debt was a major motivation for 1720 activity

	- From [Macdonald(2006), 187] issued 1702-1710 (call it 1705, making them maturity 1737 and 1804) and roughly coupon $6.67\%$

	- In 1720 they are roughly 17yrs and 84yr maturity.

	- With market rates @5%, PV(17yr 6.67% annuity @ 5%) = 75.198, PV(84yr 6.67% annuity @ 5%) = 131.186

	- To reduce coupon to $5 \%$, PV(17yr $5 \%$ annuity @ $5 \%$ ) = 56.37, PV(84yr $5 \%$ annuity @ $5 \%$ ) = 98.340

	- Replacing those 99yr irredeemables with a new £5 perpetual at par (100) would mean large loss for holders.

	- This was the crux of the problem

# V. £8.4Mn Short-Term
- perpetuals & redeemability: perpetual annuities had redemption features automatically written into the contract (Macdonald p 187). A holdover from medieval usury laws, where a perpetual (non-fixed) annuity had to be redeemable or else the borrower was "enslaving" themselves to the lender.
- 32yr & 99yr not redeemable. Because they expired automatically they did not have the redeemable feature automatically written in, but from an economic perspective there was no real difference between 99yrs and forever
- Important, because the perpetuals could be redeemed (or coupon lowered - same thing) and thus would not be so expensive when rates fell.
- The redeemables were hanging around costing the government.
# 1717 - Refunding Annuities & Lotteries

Interest rates fell sharply, gov't could refund

Rates fell to about $5\%$

Trading Co debt

BoE & SS had $6\%$ annuity

- Lowered to 5%
- Not "haircut" - redeemable
# Lottery Loans

Conversion to $5\%$ annuity

Perpetual, redeemable

- First public issue

# Big Accomplishments, But Not Finished
- Irredeemables not converted
By 1717 interest rates had fallen far enough that the government could start to restructure the debt. (Macdonald p 186)
Bank of England and South Sea Company persuaded to lower the coupons on their annuities from $6\%$ to $5\%$.
- Result of redeemability.
- Remember that $\mathbf{PV} =$ coupon / rate
- If rate down to $5\%$, then PV(£6 coupon @ $5\%$ ) = 6/0.05 = £120
- If coupon £5, the PV(£5 coupon @ 5%) = 5/0.05 = £100
- Government says: "We will either redeem (you get £100) or you lower coupon (you get £100).
- Not a haircut because it is part of the contract
- Subsequently prices rose to £104.
$$
- \mathbf {P V} = £ 104 = £ 5 / \mathbf {y} = > \mathbf {y} = 4.8 \%
$$
- End of year, short-term debt refunded with coupon £4.
- Implies rate had fallen to $4\%$.

By September 1720 the bubble had burst, the South Sea Co owned most government debt, but it was nothing but a shell and the directors had fled, were in jail, or in disgrace.

Motivations: to re-structure the public debt, and particularly to convert the 32-year and 99-year irredeemables into redeemable annuities.

South Sea motivation: profit for insiders and power - breaking the Bank of England near-monopoly on banking and managing government debt

- January 21, South Sea announces it will take over entire public (non trading-company) debt of £31.6mn on favorable terms (Macdonald p 210)
- January 27, South Sea & Bank of England both submit proposals
Both South Sea and Bank of England o ered. (Macdonald 210)
- Initial proposal by South Sea Co, 21-jan-1720. Caught Bank of England by surprise.
- Motivated by watching what was happening in Paris with John Law & Mississippi Co.
- Allies in Parliament insisted BoE given chance to bid
- Both bid 27-jan-1720.
- Both had cash pay-0 s to the government
- Both would issue new securities, exchange for existing securities. Basically only way that irredeemables could be converted is if shares in company could be sold for more the 100 (say 130).
- South Sea Company won with its 1-feb-1720 bid both by pitching a good-sounding but financially impossible bid, and by massive bribery. "The next weeks [after the 1-feb bids] witnessed some of the most shameless acts of bribery in the history of Britain." (Macdonald p 213)
- By September 1720 the bubble had burst, the South Sea Co owned most government debt, but it was nothing but a shell and the directors had fled, were in jail, or in disgrace.

# South Sea Exchange As "Securitization"
# South Sea Co: Just A Shell Company - A Swindle

Some bubbles are swindles, some are not. The Mississippi Bubble was not a swindle; the South Sea Bubble was.

(Kindleberger) The South Sea Bubble is confusing.

I make sense by thinking of it as a "Securitization":

- Exchange existing debt
(irredeemables) for new $5\%$ redeemable annuities.
- Nowadays call this a mutual fund, a securitization, or a pass-through.
- The South Sea Co was nothing but government annuities.
Cash: coupons from government debt
- South Sea sells new shares to the public, uses the new money to buy the securities
- Take old securities, gives to the gov't in exchange for new $5\%$ annuities.
- In practice, South Sea Co. sold some shares to new investors for cash, and sold some shares in exchange for debt – the existing irredeemables (32-yr & 99-yr) and redeemables.
# South Sea "Exchange" As "Securitization"

Initially, Public directly own government debt (red = notional, blue = per year)

- Expensive (£1.765mn interest, 5.59%)
- Government wishes to refinance (5% or £1.56mn interest)

South Sea wins right to sell shares to public, gives old bonds to get new annuities
- Sell shares for combination of cash and old bonds
- Trades old bonds for new annuities
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/0e63248a538b0a4c364a8328de5b244ed3b88d93c7477b01d6e0c3999fadb1ed.jpg)
Final result is a "securitization": South Sea takes in gov't payments, passes it out
- But only gets £1.56mn from gov't, needs to pay out £1.765mn (or more)
- Simple: use cash for "Other Activities" - If they exist!!!

# Exchange Impossible - Kindleberger'S "Swindle"

South Sea had 31.6mn shares to sell

- Equal to nominal value of debt they were trying to exchange
- Two objectives, could not do both
NaN. Sell shares for a high price, so public would give old bonds
Particularly irredeemables
- Irredeemables paid about $6.67\%$, current market rates $5\%$
- PV 133 (6.67/0.05), trying to replace with new annuities PV 100
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/7f81d0bee54e4d613cfe918ad6dcc4bc3b2c8a7440a0f6831eac0112e53a35f8.jpg)
NaN. Sell shares for a "fair market price" supported by dividend they could pay
- Dividend paid from income from new $5\%$ annuities
- Implies price £100 (£1/share 31.6mn shares = £31.6mn = £1.58mn/0.05)
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/b64cd550a10ed1c919494da1832bc292e070e4d78bf2ef203746a7ef535a33e1.jpg)
# What Happens When Selling Shares At £100 Vs £300

Sell shares at £1 (100): 31.6mn "shares" for £31.6mn debt

- No dividend from "Other": Exchange - not ok; South Sea market price - ok
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/de36179bda1f14151cfbeff614d7e8b39e85637d9c6065bdb8a466d9cd9e6958.jpg)
Sell shares at £3 (300): 31.6mn "shares": £31.6mn debt, £63.3mn for "Other"
- "Other" was swindle: Exchange - ok; South Sea market price - not ok
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/ea369d7ce3fa2e8071202804e85ac2a1ee2304f45239e2f1c1ad763d34151b09.jpg)
# Eventually Had To Crash

Eventually had to come back to underlying value, underlying cash flow £1.58mn

CF £1.58mn / yr, market rates 5%, PV £31.6mn

- 31.6mn "shares" for £31.6mn debt, at price of £100 (£1 per share)
- PV of South Sea CFs was about £100
In the end, the South Sea Company did indeed emerge as the single largest holder of the national debt, with £33 million out of a total of around £54 million, but little good it did. (Macdonald p 226)

[Macdonald(2006)] p 216

Half its capital converted to annuities in 1723, most of the rest in

1733. Nonetheless, Britain's financial system survived – in fact grew and flourished

Understanding what happened with the South Sea Bubble is confusing. The way I make sense of it is to think as a "Securitization":

	- Idea was to exchange the existing debt (mainly the irredeemables) for new $5\%$ redeemable annuities.

	- What we would now call a mutual fund, a securitization, or a pass-through.

	- Really important to understand that although the South Sea Co was selling shares in itself, there really was nothing "there" except the existing and proposed government annuities. The only cash generated by the South Sea Co was the coupons from the underlying government debt

	- South Sea (or Bank of England) issue new securities, sells those to the public, and uses the new money to buy the securities

	- Take the old securities, gives them to the government in exchange for new $5\%$ annuities.

	- In practice, South Sea Co. sold some shares to new investors for cash, and sold some shares in exchange for debt – the existing irredeemables (32-yr & 99-yr) and redeemables.

	- No problem if they sell those 31.6mn shares for price of £1 each (or 100 as they are usually quoted). Then the South Sea Co simply has £31.6mn of old debt, exchanges it for £31.6mn of new debt, and has that $5\%$ coupon to pay out a dividend of $5\%$.

	- But what actually happened was that they sold for much more than 1 (100). 300 in May. 600 in end-May. 950 in June.

	- Say that they sold all shares at 3 (300). Then they would need to sell only 10.533mn shares to get in £31.6mn and use that for the debt. OK so far. But now they sell the remaining 21.0667mn shares to generate £63.3mn, making the whole company worth £94.8mn.

	- But the only revenue they have is the government income from the annuity, £1.58mn.

	- That only pays dividend of $1.7\%$ on the 394.8mn that people have paid in to the company.

	- This is way too low a dividend, when market rates are closer to $5\%$.

	- Basically, the future cash flows of the company make it worth only £31.6mn, the value of the government debt. The additional £63.3mn is thrown away unless the South Sea Co can figure out something useful to do with it. And that was not their scheme. Their scheme was to raise the money, not put it to any use (except buying government debt.)

# Aftermath - South Sea Co A Shell

After 1720 South Sea Co nothing more than a government debt holding company.

Largest holder of debt: £33mn out of £54mn

Half its capital converted to annuities in 1723

Most of the rest in 1733

After 1720 the South Sea Co was nothing more than a securitized government debt holding company. Half its capital converted to annuities in 1723, most of the rest in

1733. In the end, the South Sea Company did indeed emerge as the single largest holder of the national debt, with £33 million out of a total of around £54 million, but little good it did. By this stage [September 1720 or shortly after] the company was largely a shell. In 1723, half its capital was converted into perpetual annuities since its new shareholders had little interest in anything more than the regular receipt of their reduced incomes. A decade later, most of the remaining capital was similarly converted, and in 1750, the company ceased trading and became a mere appendage of the Exchequer. [Macdonald(2006), 226]

England government debt markets set on path for sustainable, liquid, transparent, deep market

I. Consols (Consolidated Stock or Consolidated Perpetuities) first issued

1734. In 1752 all outstanding redeemables converted into $3.5\%$ Consolidated Stock

(A) According to Macdonald (p. 244) originally £9mn, by 1780s £100mn. Large, liquid market.

# Aftermath - Losses

Original (pre-1720) holders of government debt lost

- 99-year annuitants: worth $25\%$ less (their annuities had been so highly valued in the exchange)
32-year annuities: received only $43\%$ of their income, but now in perpetuity
- If mature 1737 (see p. 187): PV(£1 annuity for 17 years @ 5%) = £11.274; PV(£0.43 annuity for 17 years @ 5%) = £4.848. But PV(£0.43 perpetuity @ 5% = £8.60
- So lose roughly $24\%$. Roughly same as 99-yr?
- Redeemable bondholders lost nearly $50\%$
Who gained?
- Government, and those who bought South Sea low, sold for cash
Ultimately, transfer from one group (pre-1720 debt holders) to others (gov't, speculators)

# France: A Story Of Failed Financial Restructuring

Like Britain, France had debts

Like Britain, debt and political crises triggered a speculative bubble

Unlike Britain, Mississippi was not simply a fraud

Unlike Britain, France's financial system failed to transform

- expensive borrowing
- illiquid and opaque markets
Important long-term consequences
A wounded but robust British financial system survived the shock, although legislation passed during the crisis stunted the development of Britain's corporate sector for a century. Armed with its
(mostly) modern financial system, Great Britain won all its wars save one between 1688 and 1815, traversed the first industrial revolution, built a worldwide empire, and preserved constitutional government. Devoid of a modern financial system, France lost its wars with Britain, su ered through a protracted and bloody political revolution, lost a colony to slaves, and endured Bonaparte's dictatorship.

[Sylla et al. (2009) Sylla, Wright, and Cowen] p 63
# Debt And Political Turmoil

Colbert (1661-1683) had left France in decent fiscal position

By 1715, Louis XIV death (Wars of Spanish Succession) debt-to-GDP $100\%+$

- $100\%$ of GDP is big today but France in 1715 unsustainable
Partial default during 1710 & 1715/16
- "Traditional" methods of repudiating debt
- Reduce rentes
(annuities) to $5\%$ in 1710, then $4\%$ in 1715 - value down to maybe $67\%$
- Chamber de Justice "examined" debt-holders, repudiated debt
Debt down maybe 1/3 (down to 2,000mn litres) - not enough
Also manipulating money - example 1716 recoinage - $20\%$ debasement
- Bring in 1,000 coins (gold or silver) and get back 1,000 coins but only $80\%$ of the metal
Prior to 1710
- Colbert (Chief minister 1661-1683) had left France in a good positoni (Macdonald 184 )
- Wars of Spanish Succession left France virtually bankrupt, particularly burdened by short-term debt (Macdonald $p_{183}$)
1710-1716 - Debt & Default
- Substantial debts left over from reign of Louis XIV and Wars of Spanish Succession (NB - not Napoleonic Wars, as Aliber says)
- Roughly 3,000mn litres - almost certainly more than $100\%$ of GDP ([Macdonald(2006)] p 186 - GNP roughly 2.4bn litres or $\pounds 150mn$ at current exchange rates)
Debt levels of $100\%$ are big today (US about $125\%$ now, for 1955-2008 $60 - 90\%$ ) but France in 1720 (less-developed financial markets) this was impossible
- Partial default during 1710 & 1715/16
Reduce rentals to $5\%$ in 1710, then $4\%$ in 1715 - value down to maybe $67\%$
Chamber de Justice "examined" debt-holders and their debt, repudiated
Debt down maybe 1/3 (down to 2,000mn litres)
1716 recoinage - 20% debasement
- Bring in 1,000 coins (gold or silver) and get back 1,000 coins but with only $80\%$ of the original metal

- May 1716 - Law & Co. or Banque Generale
- 6mn livres, shares of 500 livres each - payable only 125 in specie
(coin) and 375 gov't notes (billets d'etat) which were really worth about 125
- Private bank, issuing private notes that served as "money"
- Notes redeemable into specie on demand
- Paper Money - See "Digression on Money"
- Seems to have been well-managed, with BG notes trading at premium to specie (more valuable than coins)
- Early 1717 - Banque Generale notes authorized for tax payments
Sign of notes being well-managed
Made notes more "money-like"
- August 1717 - Concession of Compagnie dl'Occident (Mississippi company) (Macdonald p 194)
- The right
(monopoly) to colonize lands in the Americas
- But in reality a gov't debt consolidation
- Took in billets d'etat, gave to gov't, got $4\%$ annuity (rente perpetuelle)
- 200,000 shares, 500 livres each, payable in billets d'etat
Not very valuable - really just the $4\%$ annuity
- Worth the same at the original billets d'etat - trading at about 200 litres (60% discount)
- Late 1718, Paris brothers buy Farmers General (tax authority)
- Taxation was privately run
- somewhat like privatizing Chicago parking
- Paid 48.5mn litres/year
- Had a true source of profits - real value (as opposed to Mississippi Co)
- Hold large amount of Banque Royale notes - could cause trouble for Law by presenting for conversion
- January 1,1719 - Banque Generale becomes Banque Royale
- Goes from private to public
- Original shareholders paid back full capital even though only paid part (83%) - big profits for shareholders
- BG notes private, backed by specie originally paid in
- BR notes public (gov't debt), not backed by specie, but still convertible
- For later reference, Banque Royale note issuance:
May 1719 160mn Massive monetary
Mid-October 1719 620mn expansion: will lead
May 1720 2,700mn to inflation
- Early 1719 - Law realizes he needs control of 3 levers of finance
- Monetary issuance (Banque Royale) which he has

- Increased shares from 200k to 300k
- 40,000 shares went to crown or couriers (political insiders)
- Issues price
(July) 1000 livres
- August, September, October 1719 - Buy taxes and gov't debt
- O ers 52mn livers/yr for Farmers General

- Year-end 1719,10,000 livres - magic number that gets $2\%$ - see below
- Price of 10,000 livres not sustainable
- Mississippi Co revenue did not justify such a price - nor gov't debt (at $4\%$, not $2\%$ - see below)
- Started to fall early 1720
- Partly because people started to cash in as they had to pay for shares
- Early 1720, various edicts to support value of money
- February 1720, ban holding more than 500 livres of coins
- Caused big problems in business, disruption, opposition
- June 1720, coin
(specie) allowed back into circulation
- Interesting to contrast with 1933 in US, when the US went o gold and Roosevelt banned the private holding of gold - until the 1970s (I think)
In the US there was no big disruption, no push-back
Maybe because the banking system was better developed, with the Federal Reserve issuing notes and demand deposits at private banks
- By end-1720, shares at 100 livres (down from 1000)
# Older Material

I. August 1719 Law announced the plan to consolidate French debt

(A) The Mississippi Co (India Co by this time) lends the King money - 1,200mn I - and the King pays $3 \%$

(B) The crown uses the money to redeem its other debts

(C) The Mississippi Co gets the money from selling shares

(D) The Mississippi Co pays shareholders dividends out of revenue from the business

1. Have to or er roughly the same as existing rents - in other words $4\%$.
2. Pay this out of revenue - gov't debt + businesses (mint, taxes, trade)
II. Want to reduce yield down to $2\%$. But only way to do that is by having prices double after people buy them: speculation
# Law'S Fiscal Objectives - Debt Consolidation

Debt consolidation (August 1719) was the capstone of Law's "System" – and the trigger for the speculative bubble (Macdonald p 198)

Consolidate & restructure debt through Mississippi Co. Three objectives:

I. Convert existing debt into Mississippi Co. shares

II. Bring long-term gov't interest rate down to $2\%$ (from $10\%$ )

III. Ensure profits to crown & courtiers

(insiders) (2) impossible - risk premium for French debt - past defaults and expropriations

(3) we see with Calomiris & Haber - autocratic (but weak) governments hand out benefits to powerful political forces

These objectives fundamentally inconsistent

- For (1) & (2) needed to issue shares (1719) at low price
- For (3) needed to issues shares at high price - so don't dilute existing shareholders
(courtiers) August 1719 Law announced the plan to consolidate French debt
The Mississippi Co (India Co by this time) lends the King money - 1,200mn I - and the King pays $3 \%$
- The crown uses the money to redeem its other debts
- The Mississippi Co gets the money from selling new shares
- The Mississippi Co pays shareholders dividends out of revenue from the business
- Have to or er roughly the same as existing rentals - in other words $4\%$.
- Pay this out of revenue - gov't debt + businesses (mint, taxes, trade)
Extraordinary situation - Mississippi Co now runs the whole economy
- Collects taxes (Tax Farm)
Now let's look at how this might work.
Total revenue about 90mn I
I. Want to reduce yield down to $2\%$. But only way to do that is by having prices double after people buy them: speculation
# Mississippi Co Runs Gov'T Finances - "Gov'T Stock"

Total profits (after giving some to crown) 90mml
# To Raise 1,500Mn: Sell At 2500|: Successsell At 5000|: Failure

Raise 1,500mn, need to pay $\sim 4\%$ (match rentes)

Profit from all businesses about 90mn

- With 900k shares (600k new at 2500l) this will work
- BUT - need to ensure profits to existing holders (crown & courtiers)
- Sell fewer new shares at higher price - does not work
Sell 600k at 2500l, everything works

# Two Scenarios To Raise 1,500Mn
# Objectives (August 1719)

I. Convert debt, raise $\sim 1,500\mathrm{mn}$; pay $\sim 4\%$ (match rentals)

II. Bring yield to $2\%$ - shares have to double (low price)

III. Ensure profits to insiders - don't dilute (high price)

# Problem: Must Pay $4\%$ Dividend
- Roughly 90mn I profit in business
Hypothetical $\mathsf{P} = 2500\mathsf{I}$
- Would have supported div=100I, 4%
- better for 1 & 2 not for 3
Actual: 5000I
Cannot support div=200l, 4%
Even worse with $\mathbf{P} = 10,000I$ (after speculation)

I. Now let's examine the issue of new shares after August 1719. (Macdonald p 199)

(A) There were 300k shares existing - Law wants to give profits to those shareholders

(B) Need to raise $\sim 1,500\mathrm{mn}$ I.

1. Either lots of low-priced shares or fewer high-priced shares
II. Can raise either lots of new shares at low price (2500l) or few new shares at high price (5000l). Conflict
(A) Few new shares mean that insiders own more of the company and so get more of any profits that are distributed
2. High price & few new shares (5000l) gives $50\%$ owned by existing shareholders, but requires 120mn I of profits to get to $4 \%$ on original price
3. Macdonald (p 199) quotes existing estimates of profits from the business at 90mn I. That would have
(roughly) supported $4\%$ yield if o ered at 2500 I.
(B) Low price: Makes it easier to pay $4\%$ (convert, do (1)) & for price rise (2)
4. Less profit goes to the existing shareholders, so less profit needs to be distributed
III. In the end, Law went with the high price. Looks like he had to "buy-o" insiders.
(A) I think this is maybe the fundamental issue that doomed the undertaking
(B) Although there was a real lack of understanding of monetary economics

# Extraordinary Accomplishments, Extraordinary Di Culties

Law's failure should not obscure his vision, or his extraordinary accomplishment

- For a short time (1719-1720) he had all government revenue (taxes, mint, trade) and all debt in his company
Britain's South Sea & France's Mississippi very di erent
Some bubbles are swindles, some are not. The Mississippi Bubble was not a swindle; the South Sea Bubble was.
(Kindleberger) But Britain's political system was open to transforming finance
When the first proposal was discussed in 1715, royal advisers objected that a bank would never work under an absolute monarchy, because the king would always be tempted to raid the bank. (Velde 2007)
Britain's Parliament was populated by those who banked and lent

Some additional thoughts:

- Bubble Act 1720 - forbade joint-stock companies (limited liability companies) except by royal charter (act of parliament).
- Originally to protect the South Sea Co against competitors who might take away speculative interest
- Big contrast with today: we think of forming a company as a simple administrative action: pay some fee (maybe $50) and the state will grant a charter. It's automatic.
- Among other things this helped entrench the Bank of England's monopoly on banking in London, since other banks could only be partnerships limited to 6 partners. This ensured other banks were weak and fragile.
# "Financial Crisis As Mania" Is Tempting

Should not be lured into thinking that mania and speculation is the whole story Macdonald & Velde approach to John Law & Mississippi Co

- Britain: consolidation & transformation of gov't financing and market structure
- France: Law's Monetary & Fiscal objectives - truly radical for the time
- This view of financial crises as manias and speculative bubbles is seductive but as economists we want to think more deeply and carefully
- The approach of Macdonald & Velde to John Law & the Mississippi Co. is instructive. They look beneath the surface painted by Mackay & Kindleberger to uncover the economic forces that helped to drive the crises.
- Remember Law's to objectives (lecture 3): Monetary & Fiscal

# Easy To Look Back & Laugh

South Sea & Mississippi Co both about consolidating gov't debt

- South Sea Co. was just "gov't debt mutual fund"
Hard to understand why such a big event
- We shouldn't laugh - We understand gov't finances & debt better
- Big transformation at the time
Back to Kindleberger's "Displacement & Opportunity"
- At the time, debt consolidation was both mysterious and very important
- Transformation of debt markets could (and did) mean great things
A wounded but robust British financial system survived the shock… Armed with its
(mostly) modern financial system, Great Britain won all its wars save one between 1688 and 1815, traversed the first industrial revolution, built a worldwide empire, and preserved constitutional government. Devoid of a modern financial system, France lost its wars with Britain, su ered through a protracted and bloody political revolution, lost a colony to slaves, and endured Bonaparte's dictatorship.
# Underlying Economic & Public Finance Forces

A story of war and government finance

- Nine Year's War (1688-97); Wars of Spanish Succession (1702-1715)
Transformation in public finances - changes in England and France borrowing
- Britain - deep, transparent, ec tive, low-cost market
- France - a rather idiosyncratic, costly, shallow, inactive market.
See in three ways:
I. Borrowing capacity by later 18th c
II. Type of instruments & market
III. Defaults during 18th c
Macdonald puts this forward as a major strength of Britain
This was a period of wars and strain on public finances
I. 1688-97, the Nine Years War. Wars of Spanish Succession 1702-1715
(A) Fighting is expensive, and states usually cannot finance out of current tax revenue. So they borrow today against the promise of paying back during peaceful times.
(B) The basis of borrowing today is the ability to make a credible promise of paying back in the future.
(C) This is the story of the US in 1790 and the move from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution. The Constitution gave the central government the revenue to pay back, and paying back in full established a reputation that has stood the US in good stead.
II. The outcome, the transformation, was very di erent for France and Britain.
(A) France was the larger, arguably more prosperous, country. But ultimately Britain transformed more successfully.
(B) Britain transformed its borrowing into a deep, transparent, ec tive, low-cost market for borrowing from a wide lending public. London became the undisputed financial capital of the world in the 19th century.
(C) France maintained a rather idiosyncratic, costly, shallow, ine ective market.

- Britain more debt – lenders believed they would pay back
- Britain lower interest – lenders believed Britain was less risk
I. The first way we see the difference between the transformation of France vs Britain is to look at public finance in 1788

(B) Britain could support more debt (£245mn vs £183mn) – lenders believed they would pay back and therefore were willing to lend

(C) Britain did not have to pay such high interest rates – again lenders believed Britain was less risk and so charged a lower risk premium

II. This reflects the lower risk premium and better reputation of Britain versus France. This better reputation was earned in multiple ways.

(A) A market with simple, liquid, interchangeable instruments (see below).

(B) A proven track-record of paying debts (refraining from default - see below)

(C) Better financial management, including transparency and publication of annual public accounts (Macdonald p. 232)

# Market Depth & Defaults

England had strong, deep, liquid, active market. France a weak market with mis-mash of instruments

Consols: liquid, all same

- France: Few perpetuals, term loans, life annuities (rentes viagères)
# Defaults
- England: last default 1594 (or maybe 1688 - Glorious Revolution)
France: 1701,1715,1770,1788. Haircuts (partial defaults) 1710,1715
I. The type of instruments and depth of market
(A) England had Consols (redeemable perpetuals) - every issue the same, freely tradeable, transparent market, low rates
1. Consols first issued
2. In 1752 all outstanding redeemables converted into $3.5\%$ Consolidated Stock i. According to Macdonald (p. 244) originally £9mn, by 1780s £100mn. Large, liquid market.
3. France had some perpetuals (discredited from the the Mississippi bubble in 1720) but mainly a mish-mash of term loans with quirks, and life annuities. Hard to value, hard to trade, expensive. ([Macdonald(2006)] p 244)
 i. After 1720, aversion to issue perpetuals (which was the instrument other nations used). Insisted on specified repayment. So no simple perpetuals. Which meant issues could not be substituted - each issue unique and idiosyncratic.
 ii. Usury limit: Fundamental problem for France - usury limit of $5\%$, but lenders demanded higher than $5\%$ for all the reasons discussed here (poor credit, illiquid market). So often France would issue at a discount. (Remember, if you buy a bond at a discount then the e-ective interest is higher. Say 5l coupon for a perpetuity. If $\mathsf{Prc} = 100$, $100 = \mathsf{PV}(5\mathsf{I} \circ 5\%) = 5 / 0.05$. But if $\mathsf{Prc} = 70$, $70 = \mathsf{PV}(5\mathsf{I} \circ 7.14\%) = 5 / 0.0714$. Lenders were smart enough to know this, and it was a cute way around the $5\%$ usury limit.)
 iii. Life annuities (rentes viagères, Macdonald p. 244): this was the biggest part of French borrowing ("after 1771 they dominated public borrowing" p 244). But horrible for making a deep & liquid market. The annuity would die with the buyer (would it redeem or simply disappear? I'm not sure). Taking idiosyncrasy of issues to the nth-degree: how could anyone trade a life annuity because it would depend on the life expectancy of the seller. Adam Smith in Wealth of Nations: "No man will give for an annuity upon the life of another, whose age and state of health are nearly the same as his own, the same price that he would give for one upon his own… It can never, therefore, make so convenient a transferrable stock as a perpetual annuity, of which the real value may be supposed always the same, or very nearly the same." (Book 5,3, p. 7)
(B) Number of defaults during 18th c
4. England - last default was 1594 (or maybe 1688 Glorious Revolution). But nothing after. Britain had "graduated" from serial default
5. France another story entirely - the 18th century saw repeated defaults. According to Reinhart & Rogo, table 6.1, France defaulted 1701,1715,1770,1788. (But caution on exact dating - R&R sometimes not as careful as we would wish. I think France had haircuts - partial defaults - 1710 & 1715.1701 I have not looked carefully enough. And when we come to banking crises, R&R list 1890 for US (table A0.4.1) but it was actually 1893 for US. 1890 Barings crisis - we will look at this)
# Democracy, Autocracy, & "Expropriation" - Rule Of Law

Digression on politics & political systems

- Macdonald (Free Nation) increased borrowing under democracy
Calomiris & Haber (Fragile by Design) Democracy vs Autocracy
- Acemoglu & Robinson (Why Nations Fail) Inclusive vs Extractive
Same idea: importance of political system, temptation to expropriate
When the first proposal was discussed in 1715, royal advisers objected that a bank would never work under an absolute monarchy, because the king would always be tempted to raid the bank. (Velde 2007)
An establishment of this sort may be good in itself; but it is only so in a republic or a monarchy like England, whose finances are controlled by those alone who furnish them, and who only furnish as much as they please. But in a State which is weak, changeable, and absolute, like France, stability must necessarily be wanting to it; since the King, or in his name a mistress, a minister or favorites, or still more, such extreme necessities as we find in the years 1707-1710, may overthrow the Bank - the temptation to which would be too great, and at the same time too easy. Duc de Saint-Simon
(contemporary) I. Democracy & Enfranchisement - Inclusion vs Expropriation
(A) An important theme which crops up in various writings – here in Macdonald, the central theme of Calomiris & Haber, the central thesis of Acemoglu & Robinson – is the importance of political institutions, the rule of law, and the distinction between democracy and autocracy
II. US 1790 – one really important point: part of the reason it was made sense for the US to pay back (rather than just walk away from its debts) was because the lenders were voters – there was widespread enfranchisement – those lending to the government also had political power.
(A) This was the same in Britain following the Glorious Revolution of 1688
1. Not to say that there was a universal franchise - only men and only the upper classes could vote. But the important point is that the government represented interests of merchants and landowners, not just the king and courtiers.
(B) But not true in France.
(C) A problem with autocratic systems - temptation to expropriate. Democracy and widespread franchise tends to make this harder.
2. Two important quotes regarding France and the suitability of John Law's system.
When the first proposal [for a bank] was discussed in 1715, royal advisers objected that a bank would never work under an absolute monarchy, because the king would always be tempted to raid the bank. (Velde 2007)
An establishment of this sort may be good in itself; but it is only so in a republic or a monarchy like England, whose finances are controlled by those alone who furnish them, and who only furnish as much as they please. But in a State which is weak, changeable, and absolute, like France, stability must necessarily be wanting to it; since the King, or in his name a mistress, a minister or favorites, or still more, such extreme necessities as we find in the years 1707-1710, may overthrow the Bank - the temptation to which would be too great, and at the same time too easy.

# Modern Examples
- Mutual Funds, hedge funds, Exchange Traded Funds
- Mortgage-backed and asset-back securities
Common Stocks
Reasons for Separation - in 1720 not strict legal separation
- Spreads & Diversifies risk (mortgage-backed bonds)
- Lowers cost (mutual funds); professional management (hedge funds)
- Helps monitor and discipline (maybe South Sea & Mississippi)
- Widens audience and market
# Securitization
- Pooling of assets and repackaging of the underlying cashflows
Often into bonds
- Sometimes "trancheing" to create di erent payment or credit characteristics from those of the underlying assets
# Securitization Assets:
- Assets that go into the pool
Often fixed income instruments such as mortgages or loans or corporate bonds or credit card receivables
# Securitization Liabilities:

Often bonds but also mutual funds, common stocks

- Sometimes structured in tranches ordered in terms of payment priority
# Examples
- Mutual Funds
Hedge Funds
Mortgage-backed securities
- Pass-through (Agency - Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac - pass-throughs). Simply pool together a group of mortgages and pass through the income - payment of income and principal.
- Tanched. Pool together a group of mortgages but sell di erent
- Other Asset-Backed securities - student loans, credit card receivables, even David Bowie's bond (1997 - revenues from 25 albums recorded before 1990)
Common Stocks
- Not usually talked about as a securitization or pooled assets, but in many ways that is exactly what a share in a publicly-listed company is – a share in the cash flows generated by the pooled activities from the company.
- Usually we talk about securitization of passive assets (things like other bonds or mortgages) and not active assets like for an on-going business.
- This ties back nicely to the South Sea Co and the Mississippi Co, although the South Sea Co was truly a pooling of passive assets - simply government annuities
# Legal Structure
- Nowadays strict legal separation between manager and pool of underlying assets
- Mutual Funds in US
- Investment Company which holds assets and sells shares in itself - proportionate share of cash flows. Investment Co Act 1940 - sets rules and regulations for Investment Co structure and operations
- Investment Manager who manages the assets of the Investment Company. But a legally separate entity that cannot take the assets from the Investment Company. Investment Advisors Act 1940 - rules and regulations for managers
- For South Sea Co there was not any legal separation – people gave the South Sea Co. their money (or their existing government debt) on the promise that the South Sea Co had a good on-going business plan. A promise which was actually a fraud.
# Reasons For Securitization
- Spreads & Diversifies risk
- Big reason for mortgage-backed bonds. If you invest $100k in one mortgage then if the homeowner defaults you are out. There may be only a 5% chance but on that you lose everything. But if you invest $100k in a mortgage-backed bond with 1,000 mortgages then there'sa pretty good chance that 5% will default but then you only lose 5%, and in any case you can price that in up-front because it becomes pretty certain how much you will lose (5% of your investment) rather than all or nothing.
- Lowers cost of access (mutual funds) or provides professional management expertise (hedge funds)
- One of the biggest reasons for mutual funds and ETFs
- Helps monitor and discipline (maybe South Sea & Mississippi)
- This may have been a reasons for the South Sea Co and the Mississippi Co. Although they did it very poorly - in fact the South Sea managers were really fraudsters.
- But the Bank of England that managed the government debt, while not really pooling the government assets, played this role.
- Not something we think is necessary today for government debt, at least not in developed countries. But in 1720 could have been very valuable.
- Widens audience and market

# Economist: Alexander Hamilton'S Vision For Us Finance

In 1790, US financial system rudimentary, five banks, few insurers

- "Hamilton wanted a state-of-the-art financial set-up, like that of Britain or Holland"
- Britain and Holland were examples of "Dutch Finance" - financing government through public borrowing
- Hamilton knew the story of Law & Mississippi bubble – weak French finance
Plan: "federal debt pull together individual states' IOUs" plus a central bank
- First Bank of the United States
(BUS) $10mn in BUS shares, $8mn to public, shares @ $400
- Buy partly cash, partly US bonds
- Initially o ered July 4,1791. Buy $25 share certificate or "scrip" - essentially option to pay additional$ 375 for full share

# Economist: Scheming William Duer Interferes

William Duer (old Etonian!) schemes to corner market in federal bonds

- Duer "knew that investors needed federal bonds to pay for their BUS shares, so they tried to corner the market"
Other problem: bank itself, injected money & credit - created "bubble"
- Bubble burst, March 1792
- Hamilton "bailed out" banks and investors
Economist's narrative sort-of (but not really) correct
- Two panics (1791 & 1792)
- Deeper (and more interesting) issues

# 1792 And Bank Of Us

The Economist narrative for 1792, supplemented by [Sargent(2011), Sylla et al.(2009)Sylla, Wright, and Cowen, Sylla(2010)]:

- Focuses on the first Bank of the United States
(BUS) - Only part of the story, and arguably not the most important part
- BUS shares
- $10mn of BUS shares, $8mn to the public.
 - Initially o ered July 4,1791. $400/share, needed to buy $25 share certificate or "scrip" - essentially option to pay additional $375 for full share
 - Scrip prices went from $25 in July to $300 in August 1791
- Actually, two panics. Not highlighted by The Economist but pretty important
- Mini-panic or Bank Scrip Bubble, August
1791. Primarily in scrip, which went from $25 up to $270 or even $300 by August
1792. Crashed back to $130 by mid-August
The BUS direct public o ering led to six weeks of heated financial speculation, the likes of which had never before been witnessed in America. Bank scraps purchased at $$ 25\$ quickly doubled in price and remained at that level for most of July. In early August, they soared, reaching a bid of 264-280 asked in New York on August 11, and reportedly more than 300 in Philadelphia that same evening. Then they tumbled, in Boston from 230 on August 12 to 112 on August 14, to 154-59 in New York on August 16, and to 125-37 in Philadelphia the same day, before rallying later that month. [Sylla et al. (2009)Sylla, Wright, and Cowen] p 71
	- William Duer and "Company" - spring 1792, speculation in bonds (rather than BUS scrip).
A rather complicated plan to borrow money, launch a new bank in NY and drive down the price of BONY and thus obtain control of BONY, and then corner the market for government bonds.
Traditionally, accounts of the bubble and crash of spring 1792 focus on William Duer, a New York speculator, well-connected businessman, erstwhile governmental o' cial in both the old and new governments, and personal friend of Hamilton. The scheming and operations of Duer and other members of his speculative "company" drove securities prices to new highs early in the year. In March, when Duer could not repay the large amounts of money he had borrowed to implement his plans, the market crashed and panic ensued. The scheming involved an attempt in January to launch a large new bank in New York City in order to drive down the price of BONY stock, which would allow Duer to obtain control of it. Then, Duer and his compatriots planned to corner the market for U. S. sixes, which subscribers to the BUS would need to meet their future payments for BUS shares. [Sylla et al.

# 1790 New Constitution & Taxing Authority

Brief History (more later)

War of Independence 1776-1783, expensive

Articles of Confederation

1781. Central gov't no authority to tax, no source of revenue to pay debt

Debt "Before 1790, the government was e ectively bankrupt."

(Sylla) New Constitution March 4,1789

Solution Authority to tax taken from states and given to Federal Government

Grand Bargain: Weak to strong Federal government (Articles to Constitution):

Federal took over state debts (bailed out the states)

Federal gov't had revenue

(taxes) to pay debt

	- Debt moved from $30-$ 40 to \$70 then\$ 90

Side-deal: capital moved to Potomac

(DC) to placate southern states

Southern states did not want to have federal assume state debts. Moving the capital to DC was part of the trade-o to convince southern states. ([Sylla(2010)] p 68)

# Crisis & Transformation

Milton Friedman said that countries confront problems only after they have become crises (Sargent p 12)

The only time you can get major change is when there is a crisis. And the function of economists, like you and me, is not really to produce change, it's to make available solutions when a crisis arises. A crisis arises and you're going to take up some solution that is already there. At that time you're not going to get the bottom of it. (Friedman to Becker, 2002)

Government funding & fiscal crisis - not the "financial fraud" of The Economist

Before 1790, the [US] government was e ectively bankrupt.

(Sylla) Before 1790, the [US] government was e ectively bankrupt. ([Sylla(2010)] p 59)

# Hamilton - Author Of Transformation

Alexander Hamilton was the intellectual force shaping the transformation

- Essays on "political economy" written 1779-1781
Hamilton knew quite a lot about the successful financial revolutions of the Dutch and the British, and the aborted eorts of John Law in France. From those histories he drew the conclusion that finance was the key both to state power and economic growth.

# 2.2 Constitution & History
# Contents
# Sargent ([Sargent(2011)]) And Analysis
# Pre-History
# History Over-View
- Prior to independence, US banking & finance limited, haphazard
- The War of Independence of 1775-1783 expensive (4-5x inc)
- By late 1780s the US free but e ectively in default
- Fundamental problem: Under Articles of Confederation States could tax, the central government not
- More fundamental, subtle, and important problem - British trade, discrimination, and playing o one state vs another
# Solution: New Constitution

To rearrange powers and incentives, the framers scrapped the original constitution, the Articles of Confederation, and wrote an entirely new one better designed to protect U. S. government creditors. The U. S. constitution realigned incentives and authorities in ways that

(a) let the central government devote enough tax revenues to service debts that the Continental Congress and the states had issued to pay for the war, and

(b) gave the central government exclusive authority to tax and regulate U. S. international trade. That gave the federal government the tools to implement a national trade policy (Sargent p 13)

The move from weak to strong central government a grand bargain

The story of 1792 and the Bank of the United States is as much, or more, a story about fiscal issues and war financing as it is about speculation and mania.

- Prior to 1780 and independence from Britain, US banking was limited and haphazard. Limited by the Crown
- The War of Independence (Revolutionary War) of 1775-1783 was expensive.
- Calomiris & Haber estimate it was 4-5x annual income. And income went down due to the disruption of the revolution [Macdonald(2006)] p 292 has estimate of cost
- Calomiris & Haber discuss some of the issues in resolving the debt. But Tom Sargent, in his Nobel lecture, does a really nice job: "U. S. Then, Europe Now": http://www.tomsargent.com/research/Sarg
- By the late 1780s the US was free but e ectively in default.
- The states and the central government had issued both paper money and interest-bearing debt. Money can often be thought of as non-interest-bearing government debt.
- In any case by 1790 the US owed about about $ $79mn $. 1/3 by states, 2/3 by central government
- But here was the fundamental problem: States could levy taxes, the central government could not
- The original structure of the US was the Articles of Confederation, ratified 1781.
- The central government was very weak, with power to levy taxes given to the states. The central government had to go asking for money from the states and the states, naturally, didn't give very much.
- This was a fiscal crisis - the central government could not pay its debts and the states
- There was an even more fundamental, subtle, and important problem - British trade, discrimination, and playing o one state vs another
- Most government revenue at this time was taxes on trade.
- Much trade was within the British imperial trading system - with Britain and its colonies.
- With tari s under control of each state, the British could play o states against each other, pulling trade away from a state that tried to raise tari s. The 13 colonies could not provide a unified front that would allow the states, or the central government, to raise the necessary revenue.
To rearrange powers and incentives, the framers scrapped the original constitution, the Articles of Confederation, and wrote an entirely new one better designed to protect U. S. government creditors. The U. S. constitution realigned incentives and authorities in ways that
(a) let the central government devote enough tax revenues to service debts that the Continental Congress and the states had issued to pay for the war, and
(b) gave the central government exclusive authority to tax and regulate U. S. international trade. That gave the federal government the tools to implement a national trade policy ([Sargent(2011)] p 13)
- The move from weak central government (Articles of Confederation) to strong Federal government (US Constitution) was grand bargain:
- States gave taxation to the Federal government,
- Federal government took over state debts (bailed out the states)
# Constitution As Fiscal "Grand Bargain"
- Move from weak central government (Articles of Confederation) to strong Federal government (US Constitution) was grand bargain:
- States gave taxation to the Federal government,
- Federal government took over state debts (bailed out the states)

"Measured at par (but not at the deeply discounted values then prevailing in the market), the ratio of Continental plus state debt to GDP stood at about $40\%$, a massive debt at a time when the government could raise at most only a small percentage of GDP in taxes." [Sargent(2011)] pp 12-13)

# Hamilton Invented Modern Central Bank Management

Hamilton's management masterful had it not been dealt with as e ectively as it was, the panic of 1792 might have destroyed America's financial revolution and with it the country's relative prosperity and political peace. (Sylla p 63)

Open market operations (1791, Sylla p 78)

- Used "sinking fund" to buy bonds - inject cash into system
Lender-of-last-resort operations 1792
- Invented "Bagehot's rules" 81 years before Bagehot
- First: lend freely and vigorously, but at a very high rate of interest (to discourage those who do not have liquidity problems)
- Second: lend on all good securities (securities used as collateral) to everyone who is solvent
- Hamilton's management of the crisis was masterful had it not been dealt with as e ectively as it was, the panic of 1792 might have destroyed America's financial revolution and with it the country's relative prosperity and political peace. ([Sylla et al. (2009) Sylla, Wright, and Cowen] p 63)
- Hamilton invented "Bagehot's rules" about central bank management of crises, some 80 years before Bagehot did.
- Central Bank policy during financial (liquidity crisis) - Bagehot's rules ([Bagehot(2012)] Chapter 7, paragraphs 57-58) but actually articulated & implemented by Hamilton 80 years earlier (1792)
- First: lend freely and vigorously, but at a very high rate of interest (to discourage those who do not have liquidity problems)
- Second: lend on all good securities (securities used as collateral) to everyone who is solvent in time of panic it [the central bank] must advance freely and vigorously to the public out of the reserve.
First. That these loans should only be made at a very high rate of interest. This will operate as a heavy fine on unreasonable timidity, and will prevent the greatest number of applications by persons who do not require it. The rate should be raised early in the panic, so that the fine may be paid early; that no one may borrow out of idle precaution without paying well for it; that the Banking reserve may be protected as far as possible.
Secondly. That at this rate these advances should be made on all good banking securities, and as largely as the public ask for them. The reason is plain. The object is to stay alarm, and nothing therefore should be done to cause alarm. But the way to cause alarm is to refuse some one who has good security to o er… No advances indeed need be made by which the Bank will ultimately lose. The amount of bad business in commercial countries is an infinitesimally small fraction of the whole business… The great majority, the majority to be protected, are the 'sound' people, the people who have good security to o er. If it is known that the Bank of England is freely advancing on what in ordinary times is reckoned a good security--on what is then commonly pledged and easily convertible--the alarm of the solvent merchants and bankers will be stayed. But if securities, really good and usually convertible, are refused by the Bank, the alarm will not abate, the other loans made will fail in obtaining their end, and the panic will become worse and worse. ([Bagehot(2012)] Chapter 7, paragraphs 57-58)

Central Bank method for putting money into economy or taking out Actually very simple:

- Buying & selling bonds
- Put money in: buy existing bonds from banks (pay with money)
- Take money out: sell bonds to banks (take back money)
- Lending: Repo
(repurchase) operations
- Put money in: Lend money, taking in something
(bonds) as collateral
In normal times, these occur periodically, low levels
In liquidity crisis, can be larger (to inject large amounts of money) - particularly repo or lending
"Lender-of-last resort" & Bagehot's rules
- During liquidity crisis:
- Lend as much as banks want, but at "penalty rate"
-Lend on all good collateral
- Goal: provide liquidity

# Money & Liquidity Provided By Federal Reserve (18:Q2)

Currency to Public: direct currency issued to public

Reserves, repos, vault cash to banks: public as checking deposits

Bonds held: cash transferred to public ("open market operations")

# Traditional Story Of Central Banking & Money

Currency & Reserves ("Liquid Assets") in short supply

- Comes from gold (19th c) or Central Bank (20th c)
"Money" creation limited by Currency & Reserves
- When more gold found or more reserves issued, money goes up
Central Bank issues reserves by:
- Repo: lending money and borrowing securities)
- Open Market Operations: Buying securities and giving money
# Repo Or Sell / Buy-Back - Borrowing Money

BUY: Buy today at $\mathbf{P_0}$ (give \$100), plan sell later at high price (get $?X?)

REPO (2%): Sell today at $\mathbf{P_0}$ (get \$100), agree to buy back at $\mathbf{P_1}$ (give \$102)

Buy today and hope price goes way up

Today: Buy & Repo all cancel

- Get bond from purchase, give it for repo
- Give \$100 for purchase, get it from repo
# Tomorrow: Cash Doesn'T Cancel
- Get bond back from repo, then sell in market - Bonds cancel
- Get?X? from selling, give away \$102 in repo
Profit $=?X? - 102$
- If $\mathbf{?X}$ is high, make money. If low, lose
# Where Does Repo Price Of \$102 Come From?

Borrow @2%: PV Pricing (Forward Pricing)

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbf {P}_{0} = \frac{\mathbf {P}_{n}}{(1 + y)^{n}} \\ \mathbf {P}_{0} = $ 100; \mathbf {y} = 2 \%; \mathbf {n} = 1 \\ \mathbf {P}_{\mathrm{n}} = $ 102 \\ \end{array}
$$
# Repo Is Borrowing Money (Collateralized Borrowing)

Here, borrow at $2\%$ for 1 year

# Brief History Of Us Central Bank

From 1830-1913, no US Central Bank

- Money supply not managed
- 1893,1907: liquidity crisis depression because no way to expand money
1907 crisis led to founding of US Federal Reserve in 1913
1930s: Fed failed to provide liquidity
Fed created Great Depression:
Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we [Fed] did it.
(Bernanke) 2008: Fed injected massive liquidity
- QE 1 (Quantitative Easing)
- Reserves grew massively
# 3.2 Debates: "Fairness" & "Evils Of Debt"
# Contents

In both of these we see echos of debates that have continued to this day

# "Fairness" & Federalists Vs Populists

Debate over paying back in full vs at market value

An especially fascinating part of Hamilton's report is his response to James Madison's proposal to discriminate among current owners of Continental bonds according to when they had purchased them. Motivated by concerns about fairness, Madison wanted to take away inordinate capital gains from people who had purchased Continental bonds at discount; he also wanted to compensate former owners who had sold them at discount. Hamilton convinced Congress that such ex post discrimination would adversely a etc the beliefs of prospective purchasers of government debt and would thereby damage liquidity and trust in the market for bearer government bonds. (Sargent p 15)

# "Fairness" & Federalists Vs Populists
- Paying back in full did two things:
- Established reputation to pay back debts - future low risk premium
- Helped establish liquid and deep market for tradeable debt
- Echoes of England vs France
- After Mississippi bubble, France discriminated - and also in 1710
- After South Sea, contracts generally honored in the courts
- Paying back in full vs at market value
-Decision to pay back full notional controversial
- In a fundamental sense "unfair" - many original lenders lost out
- Sargent:

([Sargent(2011)] p 15)
- Did two things:

If discriminate, investors would not have confidence they could sell and transfer bonds
- Echoes of England vs France
- After Mississippi bubble, France discriminated - and also in 1710
"The objective, as far as was possible, was to return to the status quo ante…. In February 1721 a commission was established to inspect all contracts and claims." (Macdonald p. 222)
After South Sea, contracts generally honored in the courts
"While the shareholders, creditors, and debts of the South Sea Company were not left to sort out their positions solely according to their original contracts, there was no attempt to return to the status quo ante." (Macdonald p. 224).
# "Evils Of Debt"

Hamilton

(Federalists) vs Gallatin (Republican, Je erson & Madison)

Like other Republican leaders, Gallatin thought most public debts were bad (Sylla p 75)

His view was that "every nation is enfeebled by a public debt," and that the best policy was to extinguish public debt as quickly as it was feasible to do so by cutting spending and increasing taxes. (p 79)

In fact, seems Hamilton was right - financial market transformation (including debt) transformed America

- Best evidence, US grew $>1\%$ per-capita for decades.
- Faster than UK
- One amazing statistic: 1800 life expectancy US 56yrs, UK 36yrs
There was a high-level financial policy debate of sorts in the mid-1790s. On one side was Albert Gallatin, a Republican congressman from western Pennsylvania and future treasury secretary in the Jeerson and Madison administrations. Gallatin was the Republican opposition's financial expert, a role that corresponded to Hamilton's role in the Federalist Party. ([Sylla(2010)] p 74)
Like other Republican leaders, Gallatin thought most public debts were bad, and his principal charge against Hamilton's policies was that the assumption of state debts in 1790 had made the national debt larger than it needed to be by at least \$10.9 million. ([Sylla(2010)] p 75)
Gallatin closed his Sketch with a challenge to the view that the debt funding plan "had created a large productive capital which did not exist before." His view was that "every nation is enfeebled by a public debt," and that the best policy was to extinguish public debt as quickly as it was feasible to do so by cutting spending and increasing taxes. He lamented the fact that foreign investors had purchased so much of the U. S. debt and other American securities, which only led the American sellers "to consume, to spend more, and they have consumed and spent extravagantly."
Taking in the great number of elegant houses which have been built within a few years in all the large cities, and which, however convenient to the inhabitants, a ord no additional revenue to the nation, it may be asserted that the greater part of the capital thus drawn from Europe for purchases of stock has been actually consumed, without leaving in its stead any other productive capital, and thus as the nation still owes the whole, it has been impoverished even by the only consequence of the funding system that has made any temporary addition to the apparent wealth of the country. That wealth is, in a great degree, consumed and destroyed, and the whole debt remains to be paid. (Adams 1960, III, 149)
Substitute China for Europe in this passage, and Gallatin's message would seem rather similar to arguments one often hears today, more than two centuries later. Other passages in his essay indicate that he would subscribe to "crowding out"—the idea that public borrowing and spending reduces private investment—as well as Ricardian equivalence—the notion that people react to increases in public debt by increasing their savings in order to be able to pay the increased taxes necessary to service a larger public debt. ([Sylla(2010)] p 79)
# Remember Six Critical Components

After transformation, US had:

I. stable public finances and debt management;

II. stable money;

III. an e ective central bank;

IV. a functioning banking system;

V. active securities markets;

VI. a growing number of business corporations, financial and non-financial

# 4 Colonies And Inflation Tax
# Contents
# Debt And Taxes

Governments generally need to raise revenue

Historically, to fight wars

- Now, wars + social programs (unemployment insurance, retirement & pensions, roads & bridges, police,…)
"Anglo-Dutch" Finance (Britain slowly post 1720, US quickly post-1789):
- Borrowing (during wars) to extract current resources versus future repayment
Ultimately, must extract resources from population - Taxation
- Stable & reliable debt ("Anglo-Dutch") requires stable & reliable taxation
Various means of taxation:
- Now: Income tax, sales tax
(VAT) Historically: tari s
One important tax, hard to understand but important: Inflation Tax
- Introduce here, come back when discuss hyperinflation
US Colonies (prior to 1789) used Inflation Tax
# Remember Money & Inflation: Money Prices Quantity Theory Of Money: Money Causes Inflation
- Virtually 1-for-1 when consider huge changes in money
-Across countries, $\mathbf{R}^2 = 0.97$;Absolutely 1-for-1: slope 1.00

From Reinhart & Rogo (2008 NBER paper) Figure 13 Worldwide inflation took o after 1945 (with big spike in 1920s - discuss later)

- Post 1945 - World moving to paper money (fiat money)
[Reinhart and Rogo (2008), Figure 13]
# "Inflation Tax" - Raising Revenue Via Inflation

Why inflation? Why do governments print "too much money"?

- Inflation Tax: a way to raise revenue, even if other taxes do not work
- In 1700s (and War of Independence), American colonies preferred inflation tax
- Often, weak or troubled states turn to inflation taxation
John Maynard Keynes's A Tract on Monetary Reform is the best I have ever seen
A Government can live for a long time, even the German Government or the Russian Government, by printing paper money. That is to say, it can by this means secure the command over real resources, - resources just as real as those obtained by taxation.
The burden of the tax is well spread, cannot be evaded, costs nothing to collect, and falls, in a rough sort of way, in proportion to the wealth of the victim. No wonder its superficial advantages have attracted Ministers of Finance
# Keynes'S Example Illustrates Inflation Tax

Country with \$36mn in currency

- Using dollars because it was a "hard currency" - tied to gold
- Let's call that \$36mn of gold (or say that is 36mn cups of co ee)
- 9mn notes, so each worth \$4 or 4 cups of coee
Government decides to print additional 3mn notes
- 12mn notes, but still worth 36mn cups of co ee
Each note now worth \$3 of gold or 3 cups of coee
The original 9mn notes, held by public, now worth \$27mn of gold, 27mn co ees
- Public has given to the gov't §9mn of gold or 9mn cups of cofee the Government has transferred from the public to itself an amount of resources equal to \$9mn, just as successfully as if it had raised this sum in taxation
In fact, the Gov't has raised it through an Inflation Tax
[Keynes(1923), Chapter II0.1], [Macdonald(2006), 285]
# Government Can Continue To Tax

Government can play same game again

- Print further 4mn notes
- Now 16mn total, each worth \$2.25
(gold) or 2.25 co ees
 - Those "new" 12mn of notes worth only \$27mn
(gold) or 27mn co ees
- Government again took \$9mn
(gold) How & Why does this work?
- We assume people want money, it is useful for daily life
- Assume public wants to hold \$36mn
(gold) or 36mn co ees
- Every year, to still hold 36mn co ees in money, must "buy" extra notes
- Must give government 9mn co ees
Every year, transfer 9mn co ees to government - real resources, a true tax the Government can continue to raise resources by inflation…. the conveniences of using money in daily life are so great that the public are prepared, rather than forego them [the conveniences of money], to pay the inflationary tax, provided it is not raised to a prohibitive level.
# Inflation Tax For U. S.

Inflation Tax = Real Balance Inflation Rate

- US M1(Dec 2019) = \$4,000bn
US inflation about $2.5\%$ per year
- Inflation Tax about \$100bn per year
Compare with regular taxes (income, corporate,…) of roughly \$3,863bn
# Hyperinflation - Inflation Out Of Control

This whole scheme, however, is rather unstable

- Governments cannot always plan steady money creation
- Government may not fully understand relation between inflation and tax
- Public tries to avoid tax by reducing holding of money - say reduce note holdings from 36mn co ees to 20mn co ees
Most importantly, Government may try to raise more revenue and print even more money
- As gov't prints more, public holds less, gov't prints more, and things spiral out of control
German hyperinflation August 1922 - November 1923, prices up by 6.6bn.
- If a cup of co ee cost \$3.50 August 1922, it cost\$ 23,000,000,000 in November 1923
# Inflation Hugely Damaging

Modest inflation

(maybe) tolerable

- But inflation rarely stays "modest"
Keynes once again said it eloquently (Economic Consequences of the Peace):
Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some.

# The Enduring Puzzle Of Money & Inflation

What is money?

What causes inflation?

Two of the most enduring puzzles in macroeconomics

Particularly relevant today

- And why was it so low post-2008?
- Burst of inflation 2021-2022 - highest in $40+$ years
- Only to surge in 2022?

Median Inflation Rate All Countries

5-Year Moving Average: 1500-2006

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/0117f6739070834356841e12a3662190d4e1703e0411a66f98e16cc8bcde9788.jpg)

From Reinhart & Rogo (2008 NBER paper) Figure 13

Worldwide inflation took o after 1945 (with big spike in 1920s - discuss later)

- Post 1945 - World moving to paper money (fiat money)
[Reinhart and Rogo Reinhart and Rogo 2008, Figure 13]
The figure shows the median inflation rate across a large sample of countries, covering much of the world.
- Because it's the median it excludes hyperinflations - it provides a reasonable estimate of the average or central tendency for inflation across the world.
- The most striking observation is that over a long span of history, up until roughly the 1930s, inflation was sometime positive, sometimes negative, with no strong tendency for positive inflation. That changed dramatically in the middle of the 20th century; since then a decided positive global inflation rate.
- Remember that this is a median so it excludes the hyperinflations of Germany, Hungary, Greece, etc.
- The positive inflation since the middle of the 20th century is really the curse of paper money – the ability and willingness of governments to print money and cause inflation. Because whatever anyone may tell you, the single and only cause of long-term, sustained, high inflation is printing money: high money growth means high inflation.
- The trade-o is that central banks now have the ability to provide liquidity and prevent disasters such as the Great Depression of the 1930s.
- There is some evidence that the world has learned something from the sustained inflations of the 1970s and central banks are better-behaved.
- Personally, I think that is true. I certainly hope so.
- Side-note. There was little inflation risk, in 2008-2009, even with the huge liquidity injections. In the US the monetary base doubled between $Q_{3}$ 2008 and $Q_{2}$ 2009.
- Little inflation risk because at the time there was a huge increase in the demand for money. All that extra liquidity got sucked up by banks, corporations, and households.
- During financial crises of the 1800s, before central banks and paper money, a financial crisis would inevitably be followed by a fall in prices - price deflation. That was due to the large increase in demand for money and liquidity, without any concomitant increase in supply.

# High Inflation Is Common - And Damaging

Inflation has two e cts:

- Default - "Inflates away debt" - makes debt disappear
- May benefit government, but private debtors really important
- Transfer from savers to borrowers
Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method, they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. (Keynes, "Economic Consequences of the Peace" 1919)
- "Inflation tax" - on-going revenue for government
Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method, they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls… become 'profiteers', who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished not less than the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds… all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which
"Inflation Tax" - Raising Revenue via Inflation - Repeating from last lecture Why inflation? Why do governments print "too much money"?
- Inflation Tax: a way to raise revenue, even if other taxes do not work
- In 1700s (and War of Independence), American colonies preferred inflation tax
- Often, weak or troubled states turn to inflation taxation
John Maynard Keynes's A Tract on Monetary Reform is the best I have ever seen
A Government can live for a long time, even the German Government or the Russian Government, by printing paper money. That is to say, it can by this means secure the command over real resources, - resources just as real as those obtained by taxation.
The burden of the tax is well spread, cannot be evaded, costs nothing to collect, and falls, in a rough sort of way, in proportion to the wealth of the victim. No wonder its superficial advantages have attracted Ministers of Finance
Keynes's Example Illustrates Inflation Tax – Repeating from last lecture
Country with \$36mn in currency
Using dollars because it was a "hard currency" - tied to gold
- Let's call that \$36mn of gold (or say that is 36mn cups of co ee)
- 9mn notes, so each worth \$4 or 4 cups of coee
Government decides to print additional 3mn notes
- 12mn notes, but still worth 36mn cups of co ee
Each note now worth \$3 of gold or 3 cups of coee
The original 9mn notes, held by public, now worth \$27mn of gold, 27mn co ees
- Public has given to the gov't §9mn of gold or 9mn cups of cofee the Government has transferred from the public to itself an amount of resources equal to \$9mn, just as successfully as if it had raised this sum in taxation
In fact, the Gov't has raised it through an Inflation Tax
[KeynesKeynes1923, Chapter II0.1], [MacdonaldMacdonald2006,285]
# Government Can Continue To Tax - Repeating From Last Lecture

Government can play same game again

- Print further 4mn notes
- Now 16mn total, each worth \$2.25
(gold) or 2.25 co ees
 - Those "new" 12mn of notes worth only \$27mn
(gold) or 27mn co ees
- Government again took \$9mn
(gold) How & Why does this work?
- We assume people want money, it is useful for daily life
- Assume public wants to hold \$36mn
(gold) or 36mn co ees
- Every year, to still hold 36mn co ees in money, must "buy" extra notes
- Must give government 9mn co ees
Every year, transfer 9mn co ees to government - real resources, a true tax the Government can continue to raise resources by inflation…. the conveniences of using money in daily life are so great that the public are prepared, rather than forego them [the conveniences of money], to pay the inflationary tax, provided it is not raised to a prohibitive level.
# Inflation Tax For U. S. - 2019

Inflation Tax = Real Balance Inflation Rate

- US M1(Dec 2019) = \$4,000bn
US inflation about $2.5\%$ per year
- Inflation Tax about \$100bn per year
Compare with regular taxes (income, corporate,…) of roughly \$3,863bn

# Hyperinflation - Inflation Out Of Control

This whole scheme, however, is rather unstable

- Governments cannot always plan steady money creation
- Government may not fully understand relation between inflation and tax
- Public tries to avoid tax by reducing holding of money - say reduce note holdings from 36mn co ees to 20mn co ees
Most importantly, Government may try to raise more revenue and print even more money
- As gov't prints more, public holds less, gov't prints more, and things spiral out of control
German hyperinflation August 1922 - November 1923, prices up by 6.6bn.
- If a cup of co ee cost \$3.50 August 1922, it cost \$23,000,000,000 in November 1923

Also holds for moderate growth - not just extremes

The horizontal axis shows currency growth less $0.67^{*}$ output growth. This adjusts very roughly for fast-growing economies needing more money, and so growth in money will have a lesser impact on price growth

(inflation) .

	- With relatively constant Y

(output) and V (velocity or the way we use money) we now have a theory of the relation between money and prices:

	- $\mathbf{MV} = \mathbf{PY}$ money, inflation

	- This theory works pretty darned well. We can look at this graph for inflation across the world for a long period – and changes in money are really the only thing that can explain changes in prices

	- Robert Barro in a macro textbook calls this "one of the oldest and most reliable conclusions about macroeconomic behavior".

	- Some of these inflations are huge - $91.2\%$ per year (Brazil, 1960-1994) means that something costing 1 Cruzeiro in 1960 would have cost 17bn Cruzeiro by

1998. This is a huge hyper-inflation.

	- Note that there were various new currencies (Cruzeiro Novo, Cruzado, Cruzado Novo) introduced, in 1964,1967,1970,1984,1986,1989,1990,1993, and finally the Real in 1994 which has been relatively stable, with inflation since 1994 only $7.9\%$ pa - accomplished by controlling the money supply - $M_{1}$ $19.5\%$ pa. (From IMF eoy CPI $1994 = 60.379$, $2007 = 162.262$, from www.bcb.gov.br $M_{1}$ Dec $1994 = 22,773$ Dec $2007 = 231,430$ )

	- The relation is dominated by the extreme cases (Brazil, Argentina, etc.) but as we'll see shortly the relation still holds pretty well even for the mass of cases below $20\%$ inflation

	- Nor is it only increases in money that are associated with increases in prices – in the US there have been a small number of periods where the Fed has cut the money supply, and prices have duly fallen (sometimes by huge amounts)

From September 1920 to January 1922 money stock fell by $9\%$ (a big fall in a short period, due to Federal Reserve actions) and price consumer prices fell by $20\%$ (a huge fall) by March 1922

Most importantly, and something we'll get back to later in the course, from 1929 to 1933 money supply fell by $31\%$ and prices by $25\%-27\%$. These are huge falls.

	- The conclusion is inescapable - changes in prices and inflation are the result of changes in money. An incredibly important but oft-ignored result

Well-documented from Hungarian and German hyperinflations of post WWI and WWII

Well-documented from Latin American in 1950s, 1960s, 1970s

But US and European politicians had to learn this all over again in the 1970s, when they did not pay attention to money growth and let inflation grow to $10\%$ during the 1970s.

Here is the money / inflation picture for "moderate" inflation up to $20\%$ per year. Still a strong and consistent relationship

# 2 What Is Money?
# 2.1 What Is A Chair?
# Contents
# What Is Money? One Of The Hardest Economics Questions

Money is all around us, should be easy to define

But money is hard to pin down

- Certainly cash (\$1 and \$10 bills)
- Yes checking account
- But what about credit card?
We need to address three questions
I. What is money? How do we define it?
II. Why do we use money (what is its value to us?)
III. Unit of Account: What is the price of money? What do we even mean by the "price" of money?
# "What Is Money"

This has to be one of the hardest questions in economics: money is all around us, shows up in so many di erent ways, and is so deeply embedded in everything we dit is hard to define. A little bit like asking "what is gravity?" Galileo standing at the top of the leaning tower of Pisa had no answer. Isaac Newton standing under his apple tree started to answer. Einstein with his big bang, expanding universe, and black holes starts to get to an answer. But we still don't know. And for money we are still back with Galileo or Newton.

We want to think about three related questions:

- "What is money?"
- "Value" - why is money valuable? Why do we use it and what services do we get from it?
- "Price" - what is the price of money
# Let'S Ask "What Is A Chair?" Attribute Vs Functional Definition

Money is hard, so let's ask an easy question:

What is a chair?

Seems silly toask"whatisachair"-weallknow But let'stryto defineachair:

- seat
- four legs
- arms back
- wooden
That seems like a decent definition, except it just doesn't work well
# Define A Chair By What It Does - Functionally

Instead of attributes, define a chair by what it does, what we use it for:

- Something we sit in
- Functional definition rather than attributes (arms, legs, wood,…)
Try the same with money - what does money do?
We use money for transactions - to buy and sell
- Liquidity is primary - confidence that others will take it, quickly, easily, without question, for the same value as when we took it
Usually we ask "what is money?" thinking that we go from "something" -> "money", as if something (gold, pieces of paper) are the idea we should start with and then we look at those to understand what is money
Instead, we should think about "money" as something we need in business and trade, in our everyday lives. We look around to find something that works well as "money" (something that does 1,2,3 above) and then we use that and call it "money"
But the underlying idea, the necessity to have something that helps us in our everyday transactions, is the important thing. Then sometimes gold, sometimes pieces of paper, sometimes bank accounts, work well. Di erent things at di erent times, and di erent things more and less well for (1,2,3).
# Money - Functional Definition

Move away from attributes to function Attributes gold

- banknotes
- bank checking account
# Function

I. Acts as a medium of exchange (liquidity & transactions)

II. Stores value (others take it for same value)

III. Acts as a unit of account (price of money)

For an economy to function, for us to buy & sell, work & play, we need something which performs those 3 functions

- Call that something Money
Money will be di erent things at di erent times
Gold
Banknotes
Federal Reserve notes
- Checking accounts
# 2.2 Textbook Definition: 1) Payments; 2) Store Of Value; 3) Unit Of Account ("Price Of Money")
# Contents
# What Does Money Do? Rather Than What Is Money?

What is Money? Hardest question I've come across

- Change from "What is money?" to "What does money do?"
- Money as an idea rather than a thing
From Textbook: Society needs something that is and does the following:
I. Transactions & Means of Payment: Makes payments fast and easy
II. Keeps value over time (store of value - does not decay or melt away like ice or snow)
III. Serves as unit of account - this is really asking "what is the price of money?"
Discuss each of these in turn
# Means Of Payment

Focus on payments process

- So important for real economy
- Involves technology as well as "money"
Before electronics and good communications
- Moved things from one person to another - say gold
With electronics and modern communications
- Move records - of ownership
The thing of money changes (what we use), but payments still necessary and important
- Also see "liquidity" below
# Store Of Value

Means two things:

I. Something that lasts, does not decay or melt

Gold works well - does not rust

- Ice or snow works poorly - melts quickly
- With electronic records, can make them last
II. Also means that the value remains over time
- Something that promises payment in future would work nicely - like a bond that promises coupons and principal
- But bonds sometimes di cult to transfer - need broker account, $\mathrm{T} + 1$ settlement
- Bank deposit works nicely - bank promises to give you cash, but you can transfer easily
Question about "cash" - why does value remain over time?
- Tricky question
- Partly practical: we can use it to pay taxes (government accepts it)
- Partly "magic": everyone believes it will remain
# Hardest Idea - Unit Of Account - The "Price Of Money"

So what the heck is "price of money"?

Hardest idea - for me to explain, and you to understand

- The overall price level (say the CPI) is the "price of money"
- More precisely, "price of money" = $\frac{1}{\text{CPI}}$ so when $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{M}}$ CPI
Easiest way to explain:
- If you want to "buy" a \$1 bill, you have to give "goods" (some combination of cups of coffee, books, computer,…)
 - If $price of basket of “goods” is high, then give small quantity of goods – price of that \$1 bill is low
# Hardest Idea - Unit Of Account - The "Price Of Money" Example:
- Years ago, price index
(CPI) was low - years ago a cup of coee cost \$1
 - To "buy" \$1 from me, you needed to give me 1 cup of coee
 - Now, price index
(CPI) is higher – and cup of co ee costs \$5
- To "buy" \$1 from me now, give me just $\frac{1}{5}$ cups of co ee
- The true price of a dollar bill has gone down, from 1 cup to $\frac{1}{5}$ cups of coee
The "price of money" is $\frac{1}{\mathsf{CPI}}$, inverse of the price level
- Overall P "price of money"
Single most important idea for money & inflation
# "Price Of Money" - Price Index - Books & Co Ee
- Let's work through an example, of a price index and "price of money"
Say you are a student, and you only buy books (to read) and co ee (to stay awake reading)
In year 1 you buy 2 books, 4 cups of co ee
- You spend \$24 - your total expenditure
- Call that an Index $= 100$
# Year 2 - All Price Up $50\%$

How much did prices rise? Easy - 50%

- Don't need any fancy index, but let's do it
How much would you spend if you purchased "original basket"?
- Spend \$36
Create Yr 2 Index: 150 - 100 $\frac{36}{24}$
- Ch: $50\%$
# Year 3 - Books Up, Coffee Not

Here'sa problem: books up $25\%$, co ee $0\%$

- Cannot easily calculate "price change"
- But ask: How much would you spend? §42
Create Yr 3 index: $175 = 100\frac{42}{24}$
- Prices rose by $16.7\%$: $\frac{175}{150} = 1.167 = 1 + \% \mathrm{ch}$
# Price Index:Weighted Prices
- Weighted Prices: $\frac{\text{Thisyearexpenditure}}{\text{Year1 expenditure}} = \frac{\mathsf{P}_3^{\text{B}}|Q_1^{\text{B}} + \mathsf{P}_3^{\text{C}}|Q_1^{\text{C}}}{\mathsf{P}_1^{\text{B}}|Q_1^{\text{B}} + \mathsf{P}_1^{\text{C}}|Q_1^{\text{C}}}$
- The CPI - "fixed weight" or Laspeyres-type index
Overstates inflation. In US, estimated at $1.1\%$ per yr
- Much better: implicit price deflator - used for GDP
- See link to example - module in Canvas
# "Price Of Money"
- Ask: how many books/co ee to "buy" \$1?
- Year 1 basket: 2 books & 4 co ee
- Year 1 costs $24 - can "buy" $1 with 1/24 of basket
- Year 2 costs $36 - can buy $1 with 1/36 of same basket
-Dollars are cheaper, get more dollars with less books/co ee
- Year 3 costs $42 - can buy $1 with 1/42 of same basket
-Dollars are even cheaper, get more dollars with less books/co ee
- "Price of Money" = 1/Price Index

II. Upon default, pay first-come - first-served
- If you're late, you get nothing
- Strong incentive to get first in line - Bank Runs
- Very different than other loans
(bonds) - Regular bond-holders, upon default, get pro-rata share (assets divided according to payment hierarchy)
- Works nicely as money
- Transfer from one bank to another
- Originally by paper check, now electronically
# Reserves To Back Deposits
- Banks need to be able to pay back deposits
(loans) when demanded
- Will hold currency or reserves
- Only hold
(maybe) \$1 reserves for \$10 deposits
- On any day, only some depositors ask for currency
- Reserves
- Held partly in currency, but mostly on account at Fed
- Fed will deliver the currency if needed
Remember First Republic balance sheet

Note that the numbers here (from Fed's Z-1) do not match the money supply numbers (from $H_{0}$0.6). Reasons are:
- Currency:
- $H_{0}$0.6 is currency outside U. S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and vaults of depository institutions
- For Dec 2007 $H_{0}$0.6 says: 760.6, Z-1 (2020;$q_{2}$ Sept 2020) says "currency outside banks" 773.9. Not sure why di erent. Maybe Z-1 includes US Treasury cash?
- For Dec 2019 $H_{0}$0.6 says: 1,1710.9, Z-1 (2020;$q_{2}$ Sept 2020) says "currency outside banks" 1,724.2. Not sure why di erent. Maybe Z-1 includes US Treasury cash?
Deposits (checking accounts)
- For Dec 2007 $H_{0}$0.6 is "demand deposits" = 301.7 + "Other Checkable Deposits" = 304.8. = 606.5 for domestically chartered commercial banks, U. S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, and Edge Act corporations (excluding those amounts held by depository institutions, the U. S. government, and foreign banks and o cial institutions) less cash items in the process of collection and Federal Reserve float.
- I think this excludes credit unions and Foreign Banking O ces in US,
- Z-1 is \$740.8. Foreign Banking O ces in US = \$11.8 and credit unions = \$73.7. So less those is \$655.3, closer to $H_{0}$0.6
- For Dec 2019 $H_{0}$0.6 is "demand deposits" = 1,592.7 + "Other Checkable Deposits" = 674.5. = 2,267.1 for domestically chartered commercial banks, U. S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, and Edge Act corporations (excluding those amounts held by depository institutions, the U. S. government, and foreign banks and oci al institutions) less cash items in the process of collection and Federal Reserve float.
- I think this excludes credit unions and Foreign Banking O ces in US,
- Z-1 is \$2,637.8. Foreign Banking O ces in US = \$188.5 and credit unions = \$212.1. So less those is \$2,235.4, pretty close to $H_{0}$0.6
# $M_{1}$ Statistics
- $M_{1}$ is sum of currency + deposits
Here are some statistics on currency, deposits, prices
- Not exactly same as figure above - deposits exclude some banks
- Growth: for 2007-19, money faster (deposits really fast)
-But price inflation lower for 2007-2019

# Standard Money Creation Story

Fed controls

(slows) money growth by

I. Controlling issuance of currency

II. Controlling reserves (making reserves expensive, so banks create fewer demand deposits)

Fed makes reserves expensive by increasing interest rate (Fed Funds rate)

- Before 2008, banks earned $0\%$ interest on reserves
- If hold reserves, expensive (relative to lending to customers)
NOW, Ready for Money, Inflation, and Quantity Theory

# Quantity Theory Of Money - Standard Theory Of Inflation & Money
- We want to understand causes of inflation
- Quantity Theory is oldest & best-understood
Quantity Equation
$$
\mathbf {M}_{\mathrm{i}} \mathbf {V} = \mathbf {P}_{\mathrm{i}} \mathbf {Q}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{r} \mathsf {M} = \text{qu an ti ty of}" \text{mo ne y}" \\ \mathsf {V} = \text{ve lo ci ty} \end{array}
$$

$\mathbf{P} =$ price level

$$
\mathbb {Q} (\text{or} \Upsilon) = \text{qu an ti ty of ou tp ut}
$$
- Goal: understand how & why of Quantity Theory
# Quantity Equation - Transactions Version - Money In Motion
- Remember Uses of Money
- Payments - focus on this here
-Store of value
- Quantity of money used in transactions
$$
\begin{array}{r l} \mathbf {M} & = \text{qu an ti ty of}" \text{mo ne y}" \\ \mathbf {V} & = \text{ve lo ci ty} \end{array}
$$
$$
\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{V} = \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{T}

- Think about using currency in 1890
- Each transaction used currency, more T more M
- "Velocity" measures how many times each piece of money used in a year
- If more transactions, need more money

- Similarly, if M and no change in T, then P

M = quantity of "money"

 k = "Cambridge k" = 1/V

P = price level

$\mathsf{Q}$ (or $\mathsf{Y}$ ) = quantity of output

# Quantity Theory Of Money

Actual Theory of money supply and demand

-Friedman&Schwartz, MonetaryHistoryoftheUS

- Friedman's entry in New Palgrave - on Canvas
- Equation looks the same
$\mathbf{M}^{\mathrm{D}} =$ money demand
$\mathsf{R}^{\mathrm{e}} =$ exp returns on assets
$$
\mathbf {M}^{\mathrm{D}} = \mathbf {P}_{\mathrm{i}} \mathbf {k}_{\mathrm{j}} \mathbf {Q}
$$
$$
\mathbf {M}^{\mathrm{D}} = \mathbf {P}_{\mathrm{i}} \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {y}, \mathbf {R}^{\mathrm{e}}, \mathbf {\mu}, \mathbf {w}; \mathbf {u})
$$

$\mathbf{y} =$ income w = wealth

= expected inflation

$\mathsf{u} =$ all other things

- Combines demand for money due to "payments" and "store of value"
- Retains idea that M & P move 1-for-1 when other things held constant
- Money demand will go up & down as income, expected inflation,… change
# Equilibrium: Demand = Supply - Supply Shift
- Generally, supply set "exogenously" - by outside factors (amount of gold, or choice of central bank)
$$
\mathbf {M}^{\mathrm{D}} = \mathbf {P}_{i} f (\mathbf {y}, \mathbf {R}^{\mathrm{e}},, w; u)
$$
- Better to work with real money demand:
$$
\mathbf {m}^{\mathrm{D}} = \frac{\mathbf {M}^{\mathrm{D}}}{\mathbf {P}} = \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {y}, \mathbf {R}^{\mathrm{e}}, \mathbf {\Delta}, \mathbf {w}; \mathbf {u})
$$
- Keep $y, \mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{e}}$,… (demand curve) fixed
- Shift supply out
- Equilibrate, "price of money"
- "Price of money" = 1/CPI
- So CPI
(prices)

Quantity of Money
# Equilibrium: Demand = Supply - Demand Shift
- What happens when demand shifts?
$$
\mathbf {m}^{\mathrm{D}} = \frac{\mathbf {M}^{\mathrm{D}}}{\mathbf {P}} = \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {y}, \mathbf {R}^{\mathrm{e}}, \mathbf {\Delta}, \mathbf {w}; \mathbf {u})
$$

Now, $y, R^{\mathbf{e}}$, or… shift, and $M^{\mathbf{D}}$

- Shift Demand out
- What happens to prices?
- Now, "price of money"
- "Price of money" = 1/cPI
- So CPI
(prices) - Incredibly important for 2008
- And any other liquidity crisis (1893,1907,1930)

# 3.2 Puzzle 1: What Is A Liquidity Crisis? Quantity Theory Says: "Money Demand, Prices "
# Contents
# Liquidity Crisis: Demand For Liquid Assets (Money!) Surges

"Liquidity Crisis" is when everyone gets scared and panics

- Get rid of risky assets, try to hold the safest assets
Usually some form of "Money"
In 1900, safest "money" was currency: gold, or (almost as good) Federal notes convertible into gold
- Bank deposits were used as money but during crisis, they became more risky
- Bank might fail, like SVB did in March 2023
Now, safest asset might be insured deposit, or a US Treasury Bill, or a Money Market Fund from a high-quality manager, investing in government bills
- Absolutely not the uninsured deposits of Silicon Valley Bank, or First Republic Bank
# Liquidity Crisis: Demand For Liquid Assets (Money!) Surges Everyone Wants More Money
- Many things happen - prices of risky assets, people try to move out of risky banks
- For money demand, $u$ shifts ( $y$… stay the same) and real money demand $\mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{D}}$.
$$
\mathbf {m}^{\mathrm{D}} = \frac{\mathbf {M}^{\mathrm{D}}}{\mathbf {P}} = \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {y}, \mathbf {R}^{\mathrm{e}}, \mathbf {\Delta}, \mathbf {w}; \mathbf {u})
$$
- Shift Demand out
- What happens to prices?
- Now, "price of money"
- "Price of money" = 1/cPI
- So CPI

The NBER peak/trough dating is from the NBER web-site (http://www.nber.org/cycles.html). The change in prices and income are based on annual data from [Friedman and SchwartzFriedman and Schwartz1982] table 4.8. Change in prices, income, and money are the compounded annual percent change from the year in which the NBER peak occurs to the year in which the NBER trough occurs. I use per-capita real income and per-capita money stock. Income "refers to annual estimates of net national product, variant III, component method, computed by Simon Kuznets, in current and 1929 prices, 1869-1947, as revised by [Friedman and Schwartz] for 1869-1909,1917-19, and 1942-1945." Prices are "the implicit price index obtained by dividing national product in current prices by national product in 1929 prices." For 2007 and 2020, the price changes are for the PCE price index, FRED PCEPI

For FRED PCEPI as of 30-apr-2023

# The Enduring Puzzle Of Money & Inflation

What is money?

What causes inflation?

Two of the most enduring puzzles in macroeconomics

Particularly relevant today

- And why was it so low post-2008?
- Burst of inflation 2021-2022 - highest in $40+$ years
- Only to surge in 2022?

- What is inflation? Some history and a little theory.
- Evidence & Theory say Money & inflation move up & down together. M & P
- Theory
(theories) :
- Quantity Theory of Money
(Friedman) : Money growth causes inflation: M
- New Fiscal Theory of the Price Level
(FTPL) - Puzzle 1: What happens during a "liquidity crisis"?
- In fact, what is a "liquidity crisis"?
- Puzzle 2: Standard Monetary Theory did not work in 2000s
- Post-2008: M, rates low, inflation low (should have been high)
- Pandemic: M, rates low, inflation high (but why did erent from post-2008?)
- Puzzle 3: What happens when traditional "money" disappears?
- How to think about inflation with electronic money, blockchain?
Solution: New Monetary Theory: Fiscal Theory of the Price Level

New Keynesian Interest Rate Theory (inflation theory used by central banks) says low rates higher inflation

In 2007-2015, low rates low inflation

In 2019-2022, low rates high inflation

Post-2008 Fast Money, Slow Inflation - QTM vs FTPL

Post-2008: Money (both $M_{1}$ & reserves

(HPM) ) grew faster, prices slower

Pandemic (2021-2022): Money grew faster, and now inflation surged

Something is wrong

Blue = Inflation, Green = Reserves

# Contents
# Money In Today'S World

Money in 1800s, 1900s:

- Gold bars, paper currency, bank (checking accounts)
-Pay by giving someone gold, paper, or a check
"Money" today:
- Electronic deposits, electronic funds transfers
- PayPal, Venmo, Alipay
- Quantity Equation not so useful
$$
\mathbf {M}_{\text{i}} \mathbf {V} = \mathbf {P}_{\text{i}} \mathbf {Q}
$$
- What is M? Zero? (we don't need currency) Infinite? (everything is money)
- What is V? Infinite? (no "money") Zero? (everything is money)
Quantity Theory has not worked so well post-2008
- Need something new
Originally developed by Eric Leeper, with John Cochrane (formerly Chicago) doing much work now
# New Idea: Fiscal Theory Of The Price Level

(Ftpl) - Exceedingly Simple: go back to bonds

 - Example: \$6.50 every year for 4yrs, then \$100
- PV today is discounted value of future CFs
- Simple here: $6.5\%$ fixed for 4 years, then 100
- 99.658 = PV(6.5 + 100 @ rate = 6.6%)
- But CFs don't have to be fixed
- Same discounting ideas apply to stocks: dividend discount model
Stock Price $=$ PV(future dividends)
- Apply to government liabilities

# Ftpl: Discounting Future Revenue
- Apply idea of discounting future CFs to gov't
- Present Gov't Liabilities: Money + Bonds: $\frac{\mathsf{M} + \mathsf{B}}{\mathsf{P}}$
- Future Gov't Revenue: Primary Surplus: Revenue less Spending
- Primary surplus - excluding interest payments
- Conditioned to think of ordinary surplus, but wrong (for this)
- Need to think about CFs that can pay o liabilities
Real Primary Surplus: measured in quantity of goods & services
- Valuation (just like bond, equity):
Present Liabilities $=$ EPV(Future Revenue)
$$
\frac{\mathrm{M} + \mathrm{B}}{\mathrm{P}} = \mathrm{EP V} (\mathrm{Pr im Su rp})
$$
# Ftpl: Discounting Future Revenue

Present Liabilities = EPV(Future Revenue)

$$
\frac{\mathbf {M} + \mathbf {B}}{\mathbf {P}} = \mathbf {E P V} (\mathbf {P r i m S u r p})
$$

Same as a share of IBM or Apple:

- Money (and bonds) Valuable today because get future payments
- For IBM: get dollars
- For $\mathbf{M} + \mathbf{B}$: real goods & services the gov't extracts in taxes
(PrimSurp) # Quantity Theory Vs Fiscal Theory
QTM: Real Balance Size of Economy
$$
\frac{M}{P} = \frac{Q}{V} \text{or} M V = P Q
$$
- If economy grows
(Q) & money doesn't, prices down
(P) - Money supply up $(\mathsf{M}^{\mathsf{S}})$, prices up $(\mathsf{P})$
Money growth causes inflation
Real money demand up $\left(\frac{\mathbf{M}^{\mathbf{D}}}{\mathbf{P}}\right)$, prices down
(P) unless $\mathbf{M}^{\mathbf{S}}$
- Liquidity crises (as in 1907,1930s, 2008)
FTPL: Present Liabilities = EPV(Future Revenue)
$$
\frac{\mathrm{M} + \mathrm{B}}{\mathrm{P}} = \text{EP V (Pr im Su rp)}
$$

Balance today vs tomorrow matters

- Trading money for bonds does not matter $(\mathbf{M} + \mathbf{B}$ matters)
- If $M + B$ today but expected future surplus, maybe no inflation
- EPV
(PrimSurp) can go up because
- Expected future growth and increased taxes
Today discount rate
# Primary Surplus: Government Revenue

(Taxes) Less Spending

- Do not include interest payments (ordinary surplus / deficit)
# Primary Vs Ordinary Surplus
- Everyone worries
(rightly) about surplus
(deficit) - US deficit 1947-2007: $1.6\%$ of GDP (negative surplus)
- Primary Surplus 1947-2007: +0.3%

FTPL Helps Understand Post-2008 and Pandemic
Now, look at all gov't liabilities (not just money): $\frac{\mathsf{M} + \mathsf{B}}{\mathsf{P}} = \mathsf{EPV}(\mathsf{PrimSurp})$
Post-2008: money, but inflation low
- Money & Reserves (reserves, green)
Inflation low (PCE, blue)

Likely explanation: switch bonds for money (& liquidity demand )
- M+B matters, not M alone
Post-2008: debt, but inflation low
- Debt (debt-to-GDP, red)
Inflation low (PCE, blue)

Likely explanation: Gov't borrowed (created money) directly into our bank accounts
- No expectation PrimSurp
(taxes) up in future
FTPL: Balances Borrowing Today vs Payback Tomorrow FTPL is about balance between current liabilities & future cash flow
$$
\frac{\mathbf {M} + \mathbf {B}}{\mathbf {P}} = \mathbf {E P V} (\mathbf {P r i m S u r p})
$$

With FTPL we see two possibilities (two scenarios for monetary & fiscal authorities to coordinate):

I. Bonds & Future Surplus together: nothing

- Liabilities $(\mathsf{M} + \mathsf{B})$ balance future cash flows (EPV(PrimSurp))
- Ricardian Equivalence
II. Bonds, Future Surplus (no change): prices have to rise
- Liabilities go up but real value of future CFs do not change
- Something has to happen: P
Why is this useful? Helps understand 2008 & 2021
2008: money & bonds, inflation low
2021: money & bonds, high inflation

FTPL Works With No "Money"

FTPL says

$$
\frac{\mathrm{M} + \mathrm{B}}{\mathrm{P}} = \text{EP V (Pr im Su rp)}
$$
- What happens in $\mathbf{M} = 0$? Nothing. Gov't bonds B still there
Bonds set value of a "dollar" (price level) because bonds are paid back in "dollars"
- Cryptocurrencies change nothing about FTPL
- May make payments easier (good thing) but prices and dollars still set by gov't debt and promise to pay back (EPV
(PrimSurp) )

Demand Shifts Out

# Problem: Applying To Aggregate Supply & Demand Have Same Picture For Supply & Demand
- If Demand shifts, Q Growth
Appealing (and long-lived) idea:
- Growth Prices(inflation)
Seems it has to be right - Supply & Demand Mistake we make: Confusion Over Prices
- Absolute vs Relative Prices
- "Prices" (overall price level) not "price of aggregate output"
- Overall price level is the "price of money"
Confusion of words, confusion of concepts

AGGREGATE Demand Shifts Out
# Why Are "Prices" (Overall Price Index) The "Price Of Money" We Report Prices In Dollars, But What Matters Is What We Have To Give Up - Relative Prices Back To Shoes - We Say "\$150"
- But care about how many other things we give up
- The "price" of \$150 tells us how much we give up
So what is "price of money"
- What do we give up to get \$1?
Go pack to measuring "price index"

Demand Shifts Out
Why are "Prices" (overall price index) the "Price of Money"
- Ask: how many baskets of books/co ee to "buy" §1?
- Use "year 1 basket": 2 books & 4 co ee
- Year 1: basket costs $24 - can "buy" $1 with 1/24 of basket
- Year 2: basket costs $36 - can buy $1 with 1/36 of basket
- Dollars are cheaper, get more dollars with less books/coe
- "Price of Money in Terms of Goods" = 1/PriceLevel
Di cult idea to accept
- Many people say "interest rate is the price of money" - but wrong
But it is right - Priceofmoney Pricelndex
But if "prices" (price index) is "price of money" it cannot be "price of aggregate output"

Return to Aggregate Supply & Demand

Same picture for Supply & Demand as Shoes

- If Demand shifts, Q Growth
What is "Price"? Not "prices" (price index)
- What do we give up? Consumption next year
- Maybe "price" should be real interest rate
But absolutely not "prices" and inflation

# But – Some Evidence For Short-Term Phillips Curve Original Work By William Phillips

(Weak) evidence that Unemployment Prices

- Britain, 1861-1957
- Short step from Unemployment to Growth
Formed foundation for Keynesian economics in 1950s, 1960s, 1970s
- Economic policies that generated high inflation in US, Britain, Europe
In 1960s, Milton Friedman & Edmund Phelps argued
(showed) no long-term Phillips curve
# And Two Remaining Puzzles

I. If Theory says Growth & Prices don't go together long-term, why do we see they do short-term?

- Friedman, expectations & unexpected inflation
- Next slides
II. If Theory (and evidence) says no long-term Phillips Curve, why do people still use it?
- On this, I have no possible answer
# Friedman: Theory Says No Long-Term W &Ru

Natural Rate of Unemployment

- Unemployment depends on real variables: productivity, real wages, worker preferences
- Nothing to do with nominal wages
- Not "Natural" as in "Good" - depends on real variables
Strong economic theory, was no Phillips Curve
# But: Short-Term W &Ru

Unexpected Inflation

Firms: assume P means real price of their product up

- Di cult to separate inflation (all prices) from real price rise (only firm's product price up)
- Thinking their price up, raise wages to hire workers
Workers: assume W means real wage up
- So work more (increase labor supply) and unemployment down
# Unexpected Inflation Short-Run Phillips Curve

Unexpected inflation causes both firms and workers to make mistake

- Firms think price of their good up, increase output, raise wage
- Workers think their real wage up, increase working
But the unexpected inflation only fools people short-term
Eventually, back to Natural Rate of Unemployment
- Determined by productivity, etc, not inflation
# Friedman And Phelps

Milton Friedman, 1976 Nobel Prize lecture

Edmund Phelps, 1967

Friedman's argument for why short-term P Unempl

- Employers: see price of their products, mistakenly think it is relative price rather than inflation. Increase their wages to get more labor (increase labor demand)
- Workers: see their wages go up, mistakenly think it is relative wages and not inflation. Work more (increase labor supply)
- But eventually, firms and workers learn they are mistaken, go back to original labor demand and supply
Long-term, no Phillips curve - no Inflation-Output relation

- Trying to capture true value of assets
- Losses as % of deposits - SVB up to 9%
- Look at the "Big Loss" below - I chose $9 \%$ of deposits
- Close to true situation for SVB in 2022 - nearly insolvent
People did not realize until March 8
When run started, massive loss of deposits.
- I've heard \$41bn left in a day or two
- Looking at balance sheet (\$173.1bn deposits) no way they could survive

SVB is now in a very delicate position, with both Solvency Risks and Liquidity Risks

# Solvency Risk

Depositors worried investments may go down more

- Regular debts (like for Apple) cannot withdraw early
Deposits can, and rational to do so
- Get out now, before things get worse
Silicon Valley Bank was e ectively insolvent
- Assets barely worth the value of fixed obligations - "Deposits" & "Other"
# Now Turn To First Republic Bank – Painful, But Not Svb

Gains & losses for both HtM and AfS portfolio

- Losses as % of deposits - FRB up to about $3.5\%$
- Look at the "Big Loss" below - showing $3.5\%$ of deposits
- First Republic painful, but not insolvent
My view - caught in liquidity panic
- Might survive, might not. But very di erent from SVB

# Frb Is Not Insolvent
# Solvency Risk

Depositors worried investments may go down more

- Regular debts (like for Apple) cannot withdraw early
Deposits can, and rational to do so
- Get out now, before things get worse
# Liquidity Risk

Even if knew for sure assets would not go down

- Assets may be illiquid – take a few months or year to sell o
- Depositors may need money back sooner
Rational to get first in line, take money out now
First Republic Bank was not insolvent - but subject to liquidity problems and a bank run
- Bank run – where customers withdraw deposits because they are worried the bank will get into trouble in the futures

# Crises We Focus On

1893,1907 - Banking panic, suspension of convertibility

1920s - Bank failures

1930-33 - Great Depression

These all exhibit the fragility of the unit banking structure

I. Lack of diversification within banks (geographic and type of loan)

II. Concentration of reserves in New York City (country banks put reserves on deposit with NY banks)

III. Fragmented industry of small independent banks cannot coordinate response to liquidity shock

1980s - S&L crisis, unwinding of the unit banking structure

- Perverse deposit insurance incentives, changing demographics, inflation, technology - all conspired to undo unit banking
Digression on Deposit Insurance

# Hamilton, 1790, & Six Components Of Modern Financial System

Hamilton in 1789-1792 engineered a financial revolution

Sylla: When Hamilton left o ce in 1795, his adopted homeland harbored six critical institutional components that characterize modern financial systems:

I. stable public finances and debt management;

II. stable money;

III. an e ective central bank;

IV. a functioning banking system;

V. active securities markets;

VI. a growing number of business corporations, financial and non-financial

# Hamilton & Us Financial Revolution - Long-Term Banking Failure

Hamilton restructured US debt, founded 1st Bank of the US But in a real sense banking reform failed

- 1st Bank of the US charter not renewed - closed 1811
2nd Bank of the US 1816-1836
By 1830s, state control of bank charters well-established
1830s - 1990: state control, no national banking
US banking fragmented, inciient, fragile
Coalition of populist agrarians (distrusted large east-coast banks) and small bankers (wanted protection from large banks) - controlled banking for 160 years
# Remember Discussion From Lecture 4:

There was a high-level financial policy debate of sorts in the mid-1790s. On one side was Albert Gallatin, a Republican congressman from western Pennsylvania and future treasury secretary in the Jeerson and Madison administrations. Gallatin was the Republican opposition's financial expert, a role that corresponded to Hamilton's role in the Federalist Party. ([Sylla(2010)]p 74)

Like other Republican leaders, Gallatin thought most public debts were bad, and his principal charge against Hamilton's policies was that the assumption of state debts in 1790 had made the national debt larger than it needed to be by at least \$10.9 million. (p 75)

Gallatin closed his Sketch with a challenge to the view that the debt funding plan "had created a large productive capital which did not exist before." His view was that "every nation is enfeebled by a public debt," and that the best policy was to extinguish public debt as quickly as it was feasible to do so by cutting spending and increasing taxes. He lamented the fact that foreign investors had purchased so much of the U. S. debt and other American securities, which only led the American sellers "to consume, to spend more, and they have consumed and spent extravagantly."

Taking in the great number of elegant houses which have been built within a few years in all the large cities, and which, however convenient to the inhabitants, a ord no additional revenue to the nation, it may be asserted that the greater part of the capital thus drawn from Europe for purchases of stock has been actually consumed, without leaving in its stead any other productive capital, and thus as the nation still owes the whole, it has been impoverished even by the only consequence of the funding system that has made any temporary addition to the apparent wealth of the country. That wealth is, in a great degree, consumed and destroyed, and the whole debt remains to be paid. (Adams 1960, III, 149)

Substitute China for Europe in this passage, and Gallatin's message would seem rather similar to arguments one often hears today, more than two centuries later. Other passages in his essay indicate that he would subscribe to "crowding out"—the idea that public borrowing and spending reduces private investment—as well as Ricardian equivalence—the notion that people react to increases in public debt by increasing their savings in order to be able to pay the increased taxes necessary to service a larger public debt. (p 79)

Most banks no branches

In 1914 - 27,349 banks in US, $95\%$ no branches

US di erent from rest of world

- Only country with this kind of unit banking structure. Eg Canada: 38 banks in 1890,22 in 1922
- Only country experiencing recurring panics by end of 19th c (next slide)
- According to Calomiris & Haber. Reinhart & Rogo would disagree. But C&H certainly right in comparing US & Canada
US 1914: 27,349, $95\%$ no branches: [Calomiris and Haber(2015)] p 181
# Us Unit Banking

Result of political coalition between agrarian populists & local bankers

- Possible because banking laws set at state level
- Groups within state (with tacit consent of state gov't) could act in their own interest, contrary to national interest
-Benefits local bankers (earn monopoly rents)
- Potentially (particularly in early 1800s) benefitted states – revenue from bank charter fees
Unit banking system vulnerable due to 3 weaknesses
I. Lack of diversification within banks (geographic and type of loan)
II. Concentration of reserves in New York City (country banks put reserves on deposit with NY banks)
III. Fragmented industry of small independent banks cannot coordinate response to liquidity shock
# Post Civil War Growth In Number Of Banks

# Narrative
# 1893-94

Early 1893 saw a panic, touched o in May by a failure of a "stock-market favorite". (National Cordage Company - from Ahamed) Failure and suspension of banks in early 1893 was followed by restriction by banks on the convertibility of deposits into cash. Convertibility resumed September

1893. Two fundamental economic disruptions / shocks:

I. World gold quantity fell 1891-97 (relative to demand): M & MV = PY P

II. Agitation over silver (US politicians wanting silver in addition to gold)

Tended to pull gold away from US

Both tended to lower $M_{\mathbb{S}}$ relative to $M_{\mathbb{D}}$, pushing $P$ down

	- Could have gone o gold standard (allowing HPM ) but not politically possible

Also Barings Crisis in London 1890

# 1893-94 Cont'D
# Two Arguments:

I. Panic was mechanism forcing prices down: "The panic… was at bottom simply the way in which an adjustment [lower prices], forced by other considerations, worked itself out…." (F&S pp 110-111)

II. Without way to increase HPM, and with fragile banking system, banks failed and made recession much more severe

# Bank Runs & Restriction Of Payments

Panic and suspension of banks early 1893 - problems of getting cash

- Small, independent banks - requesting money (back to West and Southwest from NY)
Many of these banks were perfectly solvent and were ebarrassed on account of runs only for the length of time it took shipments of money from New York to reach them.
Caused problems in NYC, led to "Restriction of Payment"
- Banks banded together to stop conversion of deposits to currency
- "Restriction of cash payments brought to an end the stream of bank failures"
- Dual currency: cash was trading at premium - Di erent "price" for cash vs deposits - two types of money
I. Deposit-dollars
II. Currency-dollars, trading at up to $4\%$ premium (1907)
- I would pay you \$104 by check to get \$100 in currency
Many banks that suspended during 1893 had to do so because of problems with moving cash around, not because of underlying solvency:
Out of 360 state and national banks suspended during 1893, with liabilities of \$110 million, 343 suspensions with liabilities of\$ 96 million occurred west or south of Pennsylvania. In addition, 250 private and savings banks with liabilities of \$42 million suspended, with 224 of them with liabilities of \$36 million outside of New England and the Middle Atlantic States (Noyes, "The Banks and the Panic of 1893," pp. 15-16). Many of these banks were perfectly solvent and were embarrassed on account of runs only for the length of time it took shipments of money from New York to reach them. ([Friedman and Schwartz(1963)] fn 31 p 109)
# Discussion Of
- How restriction of payments brought bank runs to a halt
- How restriction of payments introduced dual currencies (cash & deposits) with exchange between them
- Mean of "restriction of payment" vs "suspension" (of bank)
Restriction of cash payments brought to an end the stream of bank failures. But it also in e etc created a dual monetary system - currency and deposits not interchangeable at a fixed rate. Currency sold at a premium for certified checks from the beginning of August to the beginning of September, when the currency premium ended, as enormous gold imports restored reserves. ([Friedman and Schwartz(1963)] p 110 - plus fn 32)
How panic was result of other more fundamental underlying forces - deflation required by fall in price of gold
The panic… was at bottom simply the way in which an adjustment, forced by other considerations, worked itself out…. ([Friedman and Schwartz(1963)] p 110-111)
- p 104: "world gold prices fell sharply [1891-97]" - is this a mis-speak? I think gold output fell and this pushed goods prices down (prices of goods denominated in gold). But I think goods prices down is gold price up. NP - 1889 to 1897 prices down $13.90\%$ or $1.85\%$ pa. p 119 - "by that time [1897] rising gold output
# 1907-08

October 1907 saw a banking panic, (Knickerbocker Trust Co.) again with restriction of convertibility of deposits into cash (lifted in early 1908).

# Time-Line:
- Bad recession May-Sept, but not disastrous (remember April 1907 SF earthquake)
- October: Knickerbocker, banking panic, and things got really bad
- Knickerbocker - related to speculation in copper
- Run-up seems an example of speculative mania
- After e etc liquidity crisis and fragmented unit banking
- NY Clearing House banks (and then others) restricted payments
- You could not convert your deposits into cash (could not cash a check)
- Stock market plunged, JP Morgan organized \$25mn support, banking seized up
# Key Issues From 1907-08

Banking fragility & bank runs:

- Weeks Oct 14 & Oct 21 - example of fragmented banking, customer worry, & chain reaction
Banking system was trying to coordinate
- Trying to increase and redistribute reserves
- Any small mistake could lead to problem - a run
In a unit banking system with some 20,000 independent banks, the impact was bound to be uneven, to force some banks into suspension, and to threaten a chain reaction involving a cumulative increase in the desire on the part of the public to convert deposits into currency. (F&S p 169)
# Banking Panic & Solution

Week of Oct 21-25 was bank run or panic in NY - subsided by end of week

US Treasury deposited \$25mn in NY banks

 - JP Morgan (the man) - \$25mn pool to support brokers
- NY Clearing House restricted payments
Some things to note:
- No Federal Reserve that could provide currency to banks
-Fedfounded1913, in response to 1907 panic
- Deposit Insurance also seen as solution
- Goal: forestall runs, provide pool of resources to solve mismatch
- But induces risk-taking - playing with "OPM"
- Pushed 8 states to pass deposit insurance
- All 8 failed in 1920s
- And failed banks in those states had worse losses
# 1907 Panic
- Severe economic recession
- Net National Product
(output) down by $11\%$ or more, 1907-1908
- For contrast, 2008-2009 recession, GDP down $2.8\%$, and that was worst since WWII
Time-line:
- Bad recession May-Sept, but not disastrous
- October: Knickerbocker, banking panic, and things got really bad
- NY Clearing House banks (and then others) suspended convertibility
You could not convert your deposits into cash (could not cash a check)
- Stock market plunged, JP Morgan organized \$25mn support, banking seized up
October 1907
Week of October 14
- 5 NYCH banks, and 3 others, required assistance
Related to stock market speculation in copper
- NYCH provided assistance, problem seemed to have been solved
- Seems to me more an example of speculative mania than C&H's thesis about fragmented unit banking
- Knickerbocker Trust and week of October 21st
- Now we get to what I see as the nub of C&H's unit banking argument
- Knickerbocker Trust Co lost reserves because of "connections with the banks originally in trouble" (Friedman & Schwartz 159)
Customers started to worry, run on Oct 22
Knickerbocker (as were all banks) too small to call on resources elsewhere. Not a member of NY CH. Bank suspended Oct 22
- Oct 23 - run on another trust co. And yet another Oct 24
- People worried that problems would carry over
# Response Of Ny Ch Banks
- Here is fragmentation problem - produces "fragility":
- Every bank needs to build up their own reserves, tries to hold extra
- There may be enough total currency
(reserves) but lumpiness means there may be some banks that have more than needed, a few with less
- Any bank with too little subject to a run
- Once runs start, it can carry over from one bank to another and necessary reserves increases - lumpiness problem becomes worse
- NY CH Banks had 3 drains on their currency:
I. Trust cos who had deposited reserves (trust cos paying out customers)
II. Interior banks (worried about panic in NY, trying to get back reserves)
III. Their own customers
Banking system was trying to coordinate
- Trying to increase and redistribute reserves
- Any small mistake could lead to problem - a run
- Fragile system
# Banking Panic And Solution
- Week of Oct 21-25 was bank run or banking panic in NY
 US Treasury deposited \$25mn in NY banks
- Some things to note:
- No Federal Reserve that could provide currency to banks (Fed founded 1913, in response to 1907 panic)
- Even with a Fed, might have been di cult to create "currency"
Gold standard: cannot really create new "money" - have to import gold from overseas or somehow induce people to give to Fed or Treasury (in return for what? bonds?)
- Deposit Insurance: purpose is to forestall run like this, to provide a pool of resources that backstop deposits and solve mismatch problem of
BUT – also induces risk-taking and moral hazard, palying with Other People's Money
(OPM) We will turn to this with Calomiris & Jaremski
Additional Steps
- JP Morgan (the man) organized \$25mn pool to support stock exchange brokers from failing
- Savings banks demanded legal notice for withdrawals
- By end of Oct 21-25 week, NY run seems to have subsided
- But still substantial problems in both NYC and rest of country
- NYC: 1) potential steel company bankruptcy (would bring down NYSE broker); 2) Possible NYC bankruptcy
- Rest of country: country banks withdrawing reserves from NY banks, losing confidence in NY banks
- NY CH did two things
I. Clearing House Loan Certificates (Monday May 28): used by members to settle balances, allowing them to use currency for customers
Essentially increase the "money" CH members had - helps solve liquidity
II. Restricted convertibility of deposits
# Restriction Of Payment
- Pretty extraordinary to think about
- You have money in the bank, you can pay bills, but you cannot get currency
(cash) - Suspension of Convertibility spread to other parts of the US
- Di erent "price" for cash vs deposits - two types of money
I. Deposit-dollars
II. Currency-dollars, trading at up to $4\%$ premium
- I would pay you \$104 by check to get \$100 in currency
# Other Problems
- Disruption of stock market, near-bankruptcy of brokerage houses (speculation in stocks)
- Standard speculative crisis
- Key issue: Fragility results from fragmented unit banking
- Lumpiness in distribution of reserves meant that banking system was vulnerable to runs
- Building systemic risk from the fragility of the fragmented banking system
# Outcome Of 1907 Panic & Crisis
- Founding of Federal Reserve in 1913
- To provide liquidity that fragmented unit banking system could not
  - But we will see that in 1930-33 Fed failed to supply liquidity – they "caused" the Great Depression
  - In contrast with 2008 when Fed supplied liquidity and almost certainly saved the world from something far worse
- Pushed 8 states to pass deposit insurance
- All 8 failed in 1920s
- And failed banks in those states had worse losses
# 2.3 Federal Reserve 1913

# Federal Reserve 1913

Restriction of payments so serious, Federal Reserve as solution Mechanism to expand HPM when necessary

- With Fed, create "currency" by "Open Market Operations"
- Gold standard: seems hard to create new "money"
-Fed issues "Federal Reserve Notes": $40\%$ Gold, $60\%$ "Eligible Paper"
- Feb 27,1932 - Glass-Steagall removed restrictions
How does Federal Reserve increase HPM under Gold Standard?
- I think "open market operations": Fed would buy US gov't bonds, bills, "eligible paper" in return for Federal Reserve notes. See "Free Gold" section in F&S, p 399
- Fed Res notes issues required backing: $40\%$ gold, $60\%$ "eligible paper" given by bnaks (commercial, ag. industrial loans…) or gold
- P 404: "If free gold had been a serious handicap… Bills could have been purchased instead of government securities, since they were eligible as collateral for Federal Reserve notes."
- I think "Bills" = "banker's acceptances"? cf p 400
- Glass-Steagall Feb 27,1932 relaxed $40\%$ gold requirement
# 1920-21

Engineered by Fed: raising rates & pushing down HPM

- Another 13: branching but limited (to protect rural banks)
- From 1921-1930, banks operating branches rose from 530 (1,281 branches) to 751 (3,522 branches)
During 1930s, "wave of 1920s failures became torrent"
1930-1933, more than 9,100 bank failed (38%)
- Depositors came to view unit banks more prone to failure
- Failures made Depression much worse - failure wipes out business & wealth

The Great Depression. Maybe the most important financial crisis ever

- Crash of 1929 was a "trigger" - and an increase in liquidity demand (for currency & reserves)
- 1929-1930 was severe recession but no worse than 1893-94 or 1907-08
Bank failures turned it from "depression" to "The Great Depression" Three phases:
- First Banking Crisis: October 1930 F&S p 308
November 256 banks failed and in December 352
- Bank of United States
(private) December 1930
- Restriction of payments might have stopped failures - But not with Fed

- October 1931,552 banks closed Bernanke. F&S p 317?
Third Banking Crisis: 1933
- Week-long "holiday" - 1/3 did not re-open Statistics on bank failures
# Why Was Policy So Bad?

Why not restrict payments

(convertibility) ?

- Friedman & Schwartz argue banks no longer had incentive or responsibility
Why didn't Fed expand HPM?
- Institutional problems
- Benjamin Strong died October 16,1928
Maybe worst single death for a country
- Move of power from NY to DC (Fed Banks vs Board of Governors)
- Lack of knowledge & expertise
# 1929-1933

The period 1929-33 is particularly important because the Great Depression is by far the most severe economic downturn in US economic history, at least for the past 150 years. Not only was it deeper and more prolonged than any other US downturn, it was also international in nature and counts as the most widespread and severe international downturn of modern times. Kindleberger dates the peak of the speculative cycle to September 1929 and NBER dates the peak of the business cycle to August

1929. The stock market crashed in October. Whatever the reason for the downturn (and it does seem have started decisively even prior to the October crash) declines in real income, consumer spending, and other real variables were substantial through 1930, with the pace accelerating after the October 1929 crash.

The October 1929 crash was essentially a widespread desire to switch from more to less risky assets. This was accomplished partly by a fall in price of the risky assets (the crash) and partly by, in essence, creating money to satisfy the demand for less risky assets: New York banks increased loans to brokers, thus increasing deposits and the stock of money.<sup>1</sup> The New York Fed supplied additional reserves (increased high-powered money) allowing New York commercial banks to increase their deposits (New York commercial banks were unwilling to increase their deposit-to-reserve ratio as it was already lower than in other parts of the country). These actions were e ective: "Despite the stock market crash, there were no panic increases in money market rates such as those in past market crises, and no indirect e ects on confidence in banks." ([Friedman and Schwartz(1963)] p. 339)

Although real variables were falling through 1930, the situation significantly deteriorated with the banking crisis in October 1930, and the subsequent crises of March 1931 and March

1930. With the Federal Reserve now in existence, in contrast to 1893-94 and 1907-08, banks did not restrict convertibility. Restrictions might have broken the cycle that led from the desire for liquidity, to conversion of deposits to currency, through to bank runs and failure and yet more desire for liquidity. Friedman and Schwartz express the opinion that restriction in 1930 would have prevented the subsequent waves of failures. Friedman and Schwartz argue that the Federal Reserve could have supplied currency and reserves to the banking system that would have helped alleviate the pressure on banks to shrink deposits, thus helping to forestall the waves of bank failures. During the period after October 1930, however, high-powered money increased by only $18\%$ (December 1930 to March 1933) and not sufficiently to o set banks' increased desire for reserves (as evidenced by the declining deposit-to-reserve ratio).

The net result is that during the 1929-1933 downturn the money stock fell by over $40\%$, due to substantial falls in the deposit-to-reserve and deposit-to-currency ratios and only partially o set by an increase in high-powered money.

In October 1930 the first banking crisis started, apparently as failures in some mid-west states "led to widespread attempts to convert deposits into currency." ([Friedman and Schwartz(1963)] p 308). In November 256 banks failed and in December

1931. The most important single failure was the Bank of United States (a private bank in spite of the name). With the Federal Reserve now in existence, banks did not restrict convertibility as they did in 1907 and
1932. Restrictions might have broken the cycle that led from the desire for liquidity, to conversion of deposits to currency, through to bank runs and failure and increased desire for liquidity. Friedman and Schwartz express the opinion that restriction would have prevented the subsequent waves of failures. High-powered money increased somewhat after October 1930, but not su ciently to o set banks' increased desire for reserves (as evidenced by the declining deposit-to-reserve ratio).

Glass-Steagall & Deposit Insurance: Reversed Reforms

Reforms of 1930s - particularly DI and FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance) - reversed reform trend civics textbooks used by just about every American high school portrait deposit insurance as a necessary step to save the banking system, all of the evidence indicates otherwise: it was the product of lobbying by unit bankers who wanted to stifle the growth of branch banking (C&H p 190)

[Calomiris and Haber(2015), 190]

# Glass-Steagall & Deposit Insurance: Reversed Reforms Important Components:
- FDIC deposit insurance: subsidy to small and in-cient banks (vs large banks)
- Section 5144 making "groups" of unit banks under holding company more di cult
- Regulation Q - prohibition against paying interest on deposits
-Benefitted small (ine cients) banks relative to larger e cients banks
- Split commercial and investment banking
- Often touted as increasing safety of banking - removal in 1999 often cited as cause of 2008 crisis
- "No evidence linking securities underwriting or lending to securities dealers with the Great Depression"
Every banking crisis, people blame securities trading or CDOs or derivatives or…
- But it's always old-fashioned bank lending
Usually mortgage or real-estate lending
# 4 1980S - Collapse Of Unit Banking
# Contents

1980s - Collapse of Populist Agrarian / Unit Banking Coalition Five forces led to demise of the old coalition (4 long-term, 1 tipping)

I. Demographics: rise of urbanization

1900, $60\%$ rural. 1970, $30\%$

II. Technology: computers & ATMs

- Computers made information about customers easy to acquire at a distance
ATMs broke branching strangle-hold
III. Price inflation: Regulation Q meant deposits left banks
- Reg Q (from 1933) restricted checking to $0\%$, savings to $5\%$. OK with low inflation, problem with high inflation
IV. Large banks losing global market share
V. Tipping point: 1980s S&L crisis
# Various 1980S Problems Pushed Out Small Bankers 1980S Problems

1980s spike in inflation & interest rates - S&L lost deposits

- Regulation Q restricted $0\%$ on deposits, $5\%$ on deposits
- Non-banks figured out how to do non-bank "checking accounts" (money-market funds)
- Collapse in agricultural prices: rural banks closed
- Oil & gas price down: Texas & Oklahoma banks hit
Banking distress of 1980s even convinced many unit bankers it would be better to support branch banking
- At least get something for their bank, rather than closing

# 1980S Savings & Loan Crisis
# S&Ls: Traditional Business
- Borrow short-duration deposits, lend on long-term mortgages
- Depended on low inflation, discipline from threat of deposit withdrawal
- In 1980s, high inflation, and deposit insurance removed threat
1980 - deposit insurance raised to \$100k/account
- Intended to protect S&Ls.
Instead, changed incentives for S&L managers - incentive to take on more risk
- Merton: idea of equity as call on firm assets
Regulatory forbearance - allowing S&Ls to take risk
- Regulators looked the other way when S&Ls were having problems
Prudential regulatory failure, according to this theory, should not be conceived as a mistake or a consequence of the inability to devise better incentives… but rather as an equilibrium regulatory outcome, designed by those who created deposit insurance as a means of increasing risk (Calomiris & Jaremski:)
# Simple Merton Model Of Equity As Call

Equity is call on assets of company

- When near bankruptcy, incentive for owners to take big bets

# Consolidation & Branching
- Consolidation (within & across states) limited cost to FDIC
- From 1979 to 1990,15 states relaxed branching restrictions
- 1982 amendment to Bank Holding Act of 1956 overrode state laws, allowing acquisition by any holding company
- Early 1980s, banks operating national networks $10\%$ of system. By mid-1990s, $70\%$
- 1994, Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching E ciency Act allowed branch banking.

# 1 Calomiris & Haber – Fragile By Design – Us Subprime Crisis

Property Rights; Political Economy; Law & Economics; Public Choice

I. This is a set of related terms & concepts, around the idea of applying Price Theory (incentives, budget constraints, preferences) to large social questions

II. Chicago has a long tradition in this, although interestingly with this specific area (Calomiris & Haber on Banking & Finance; Acemoglu & Robinson on di erential growth of nations) the interesting work has been done outside of Chicago. (Although now, with Robinson here, some of the important work is again being done here at Chicago)

(A) Aaron Director - came to Chicago Law School in 1946, trained "generations of law students and even his colleagues on the faculty in this then-new way of thinking about the law" (UofC press release on Director's death - http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/04/040913director.shtml)

Law and Economics as a field attempts to apply the scientific methods of economics—including statistics and price theory—to behaviors that in the past had been analyzed solely by appeal to the history and intuitions of the law. With coherent theory, precise hypotheses and a willingness to subject those hypotheses to empirical tests, it has transformed legal thinking in the United States and in many nations around the world. (UofC press release on Director's death - http://www.news.uchicago.edu/releases/04/040913director.shtml)

1. Aaron Director also has the distinction of helping to bring Milton Friedman to Chicago (see paper by David Mitch in October 2016 JPE - Director was not in the economics department but was an ally of Knight and some of his students – Simons, Mints), and of being Friedman's brother-in-law (Rose Director sat next to Friedman in economics and they eventually married)
(B) George Stigler - Regulatory Capture
2. "Stigler is best known for developing the Economic Theory of Regulation, also known as capture, which says that interest groups and other political participants will use the regulatory and coercive powers of government to shape laws and regulations in a way that is beneficial to them."
3. Ideas that are crucial for Calomiris & Haber's argument, but they actually do not cite Stigler very extensively
4. Another important name for government regulation: Sam Peltzman (business school - noted for his distinctive sartorial style)
(C) Ronald Coase - Externalities & the "Coase Theorem"
5. The idea of externalities – that costs (or benefits) from an activity may be born by people who do not choose the activity – is central to understanding many issues in public policy, pollution, and many others aspects of economics.
6. Coase had the central insight - an insight that had escaped earlier economists - that externalities should disappear in a world of perfect information and no transactions costs. In such a world agents can negotiate side-payments and return to equilibrium.
7. This is not to say that we actually live in such a world, but it forces us to think about why externalities matter – not because of the externalities per se but because of the transactions costs or informational asymmetries
8. Coase Theorem says that in the absence of transaction costs the assignment of property rights has no effect on the economically efficient outcome. It will obviously have equity effects.
9. It also forces us to think carefully about property rights, and is closely connected with the area of Law and Economics that has been important at Chicago since at least the 1940s.
10. "The Problem of Social Cost" published in the Journal of Law and Economics,
11. Apparently "the most-referenced article in both legal and economics scholarship." (http://www.law.uchicago.edu/alumni/magazine/fall11/lawandecon-history - also has the story of dinner at Director's house after the workshop where the group went from 20-1 against the Coase theorem to all in favor)
12. Example of cattle rancher & farmer (from paper, this quote from Wikipedia):
Coase argued that without transaction costs the initial assignment of property rights makes no di erence to whether or not the farmer and rancher can achieve the economically e cient outcome. If the cost of restraining cattle by, say, building a fence, is less than the cost of crop damage, the fence will be built. The initial assignment of property rights determines who builds the fence. If the farmer is responsible for the crop damage, the farmer will pay for the fence (as long the fence costs less than the crop damage). If the rancher is responsible for the crop damage, the rancher will build the fence. The allocation of property rights is primarily an equity issue, with consequences for the distribution of income and wealth, rather than an e ciency issue.

Economics of Regulation, Property Rights, and Coalitions
Calomiris &amp; Haber consider groups and coalitions interested in banking post-1994:
Ⅰ. Financial Industry: banking, mortgage lending
    • Goals: profit, which means managing regulation to their benefit
Ⅱ. GSEs: Fannie, Freddie - part of financial industry, but a special part
    • Goals: profit, which means managing regulation to their benefit
Ⅲ. Regulators: Fed, OCCC, FHFA (Federal Housing Finance Authority, Fannie &amp; Freddie regulator), FDIC, NCUA, OTS,...
    • Goals: job promotion; good job conditions; social welfare (good regulation)
Ⅳ. Politicians
    • Goals: donations from industry; getting elected by voters
Ⅴ. Other interest groups (Urban Activists)
    • Goals: jobs, political power &amp; influence, social welfare
Ⅵ. Public
    • Goals: Good and fair regulations; benefits (e.g. cheap &amp; easy loans)
    • May not understand or have enough time \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

I highlight the "benefits" to the public because I think this is largely overlooked and ignored, but I think it is maybe the central piece of the story. Reduction in mortgage lending standards benefited middle class borrowers the most, and politicians had strong incentives to support benefits for the public (through lower lending standards).

# Subprime Crisis Of 2007-2009

Various people have proposed various explanations

- Internal culture of banks - malfeasance of bankers and other finance professionals, and incompetence of regulators
- Low Federal Reserve policy rates post 2000 dot-com bubble
- Mortgage-backed Securities
(MBS) & derivatives
- Bush-era push for free-markets, deregulation, and repeal of Glass-Steagall
- Fannie & Freddie
Not underlying cause - Calomiris & Haber point out need two conditions
I. High Risk
II. Low Capital
Try to construct narrative for how banks took more risk, less capital
# Outline

I. This is based on Calomiris & Haber's Fragile by Design

II. Financial

(subprime) crisis of 2007-2009

(A) Why the US banking system, which broke out of the fragile and crisis-prone Unit Banking structure in the 1990s, nonetheless brought on the largest global financial crisis in a couple generations

III. Various people have proposed various explanations

(A) Internal culture of banks - malfeasance of bankers and other finance professionals, and incompetence of regulators

(B) Low Federal Reserve policy rates post 2000 dot-com bubble

(C) Mortgage-backed Securities

(MBS) & derivatives

(D) Bush-era push for free-markets, deregulation, and repeal of Glass-Steagall

(E) Fannie & Freddie

IV. These are not, in themselves, convincing. C&H (p 206-207) point out that "banking systems are susceptible to collapse only when two conditions are met in combination: banks must take on sufficient risk in their loans and other investments, and they must have inadequate capital on their balance sheets to absorb the losses associated with these risky loans and investments."

# Reminder: High Risk & Low Capital

Banking systems are susceptible to collapse only when banks both expose themselves to high risk in making loans and other investments and have inadequate capital on their balance sheets to absorb the losses associated with those risky loans and investments. (p 4)

Low risk & high capital

Left: lower credit risk (less loans) and more capital
- Either higher risk or lower capital alone - bank still solvent
Right: higher risk and lower capital - bank insolvent
• \$80 of loans & \$6 capital: Assets $94.40 ($0.40 extra)
 • §10 of capital & §90 of loans: Assets down to §93.70 (§3.70 extra)
C&H are trying to construct an account of how banks did these two: took on more risk, with insu cient capital
Let's look at what these two things look like by examining a very simple bank balance sheet
I. Assets of high-risk loans and low-risk cash. Take on more risk by more loans, less cash
II. Liabilities of Deposits
(borrowing) and Equity
(capital) III. Low risk, high capital - OK
• Assets: \$20 capital = > low risk, so lose only \$5.60
 • Liabilities: \$10 equity (10% capital ratio) => plenty of bu er to absorb \$5.60 loss

IV. Higher risk, high capital - Still OK

- Assets: Only \$10 capital => higher risk so loans fall by 7% -> lose \$6.30 (more than above), assets down to \$93.70
 - Liabilities: \$10 equity (10% capital ratio) => still enough but to absorb loss

(A) Bank loses rise because taking on more risk, more capital is eaten away, but there is still enough to protect depositors. No default or insolvency

V. Lower risk, low capital - Still OK

- Assets: \$20 capital => low risk, so lose only \$5.60
- Liabilities: \$6 equity, lower capital (6% capital ratio) => still enough but to absorb loss because losses are not large

(A) The bank losses are the same as in base case but the capital is less so there is less of a bu er. But the bu er is still enough to cover the losses.

VI. Higher risk, low capital - Default & INSOLVENCY

- Assets: \$10 capital => high risk, so lose \$6.30, assets down to \$93.70
- Liabilities: \$6 equity, lower capital (6% capital ratio) => not enough to absorb loss: loss is \$6.30 vs capital of \$6, so some of the loss comes out of deposits and the bank has to close or there is a bank run

\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

(A) Now there is default & insolvency - failure of the bank. Losses are higher and there is less equity capital so all the capital is wiped out - the bank cannot pay back all depositor money.

# Outline Of The Story

Chapter 7: increased risk - erosion of mortgage lending standards by 2007,2 out of every 5 new mortgages granted had a down payment of 3 percent or less. Amazingly, a 2006 survey done by the National Association of Realtors found that 46 percent of first-time home buyers put down no money at all, and the median first-time buyer put down only 2 percent of the purchase price. (p 256)

Chapter 8: lower capital requirements

- Two forces that push banks to hold capital - both failed
I. Markets - failed because of subsidies & guarantees
II. Regulators - failed for various political reasons
Narrative: change of one coalition to another
Not fully convincing: Worldwide crisis, C&H explain US crisis
# Outline Of The Story

Broad outline:

- Policy goal: Mortgage lending & home ownership
Coalition: Large banks and urban activists
- Politicians: Allowed - and encouraged - mispricing of mortgage risk
- Result: Low price of risk led to overconsumption and crisis
- Everyone (bankers, shareholders, but mainly middle-class home buyers) had incentive to load up on risk
Crisis as simple economics (basic price theory): set price low, over consume
- btw - I think Calomiris & Haber do excellent job on the finance side, less well on "political science" side of explaining development and durability of political coalitions
# Reminder: Implicit Bargains

Banking valuable to society, and benefits flow to many groups

- Politicians, bankers, taxpayers, shareholders, taxpayers, voters
Think carefully about the economic incentives and goals of di erent actors
Move away from idea that public o cials (or others) are perfectly rational and always doing the right thing.
- Not necessarily corrupt, just fallible and responding to incentives our goal… is not to blame…. People pursue their self-interest, and one of the ways they do that is by exercising their political rights. When they are able to form a political coalition in the pursuit of mutual advantage, they will do so. (p 213)
 deals are intended to improve the welfare of the members of those coalitions and of the group in control of the government, not of society at large…. This situation implies that many parties may be excluded from beneficial deals. (p 38)
# Old Political Coalition

Agrarian Populists and Small-town Bankers

- An old American story - Strong echoes of today and Trump's populism
- Unit banking - each state controlled banks, many allowed only one branch
- Lasted in the US from roughly 1830 to 1980s - 150 years or more.
Important points for now:
- Started falling apart in the 1980s & early 1990s
- Consolidation - from many small state & local to a few large national banks
Key - the process of consolidation was not simple
# Old Political Coalition

I. Agrarian Populists and Small-town Bankers

II. Agrarian Populists (farmers, rural politicians) distrust bankers, east coast & big city-types in general.

(A) Strong echoes of today and Trump's populism

III. Small-town bankers - clearly in their interest to keep out large, ecient, low-cost bankers

(A) The same dynamic that one sees with Walmart vs local or small mom-and-pop stores

IV. We have discussed this - how this coalition started and why it was so durable. But it lasted in the US from roughly 1830 to 1980s - 150 years or more.

(A) Bank chartering was given to states under the constitution, and the populist / banker coalition was able to win on a state-by-state basis

(B) Costly, dysfunctional, a system prone to bank runs and systemic crisis

(C) It died when it became too dysfunctional - following the S&L crisis of the 1980s.

(D) C&H's comparison with Canada - similar in many ways to the US (agrarian, low population density, expanding westward) is very good

# New Political Coalition

Broad outline:

- Policy goal: Mortgage lending & home ownership
- Coalition: Large banks and urban activists
- Politicians: Allowed - and encouraged - mispricing of mortgage risk
- Result: Low price of risk led to overconsumption and crisis
- Everyone (bankers, shareholders, but mainly middle-class home buyers) had incentive to load up on risk
Crisis as simple economics (basic price theory): set price low, over consume
I. New Political Coalition
(A) Confluence of various factors led to political coalition that produced systemic mispricing of risk
(B) Collapse of agrarian-populist / small bank coalition (due to high costs) that allowed growth of large banks with reduced costs: rents to could go to i) Shareholders ii) Customers, iii) Others
(C) Rise of urban activists concerned with urban poverty
1. I di er with C&H who talk as if activists were concerned with redistribution – better to think of concern over urban poverty
(D) Politicians and policy-makers concerned with reducing urban poverty, who
2. Believed increased access to credit could address a root cause
3. Had ability to influence legislation & regulation to both push banks to lend to new groups and provide subsidies to pay them to do so (carrot & stick)
Broad Narrative: Rent-Sharing, Mispricing of Risk
Political bargain that emerged in the 1980s - large banks, GSEs, politicians, urban activists
	- Replaces former agrarian populist / small bank coalition
Banks and GSEs allowed to grow into enormous enterprises
Rents to share with i) Shareholders; ii) Customers; iii) Others
	- In the end, much directed towards urban activists
Final key element: politicians & policy-makers directing credit towards urban poor - through mispricing of risk
# "Income Redistribution" Vs "Combating Poverty"

Calomiris & Haber focus on "Income Redistribution" as prime goal of new coalition

Rising inequality 1980s-to-present

- American political culture and institutions make it very di cult to pass explicit income redistribution
I would say
(somewhat) the same from a di erent - maybe less judgmental - perspective
- "Combating Poverty"
- Opening opportunities to many - particularly urban poor - who did not have access to banking and credit
- Improvement in welfare and life outcomes
Many advocating these policies (bankers, activists, politicians) did not understand or recognize the negative consequences
- Much easier to look back and understand the stupidity of the policies
- At the time, many of the policies seemed smart and reasonable
- And most people were not economists who would understand the unintended consequences
Does not excuse the bad policies, but makes it easier to understand how and why
# Implied Tax & Transfer Rate

Simplest way to express: define Implied Tax & Transfer Rate:

Pretax - Aftertax

Pretax

- With taxes only, Pretax $>$ Aftertax, a regular tax rate, like 15%
- With transfers, we can have Aftertax $>$ Pretax and this rate can be negative
Figures: Spatio-temporal net redistribution rate
- Bottom quintile (20%): from -37% in 1966, to -150% in 2019
- For every \$100 of pre-tax income, receive \$150 more in transfers
Even middle quintile zero since 2008

# 2 Mortgage Lending As Policy Goal
# Contents

Mortgage Lending & Home Ownership: Policy Goal

Long history in US as policy goal

- Federal land banks (1916)
- Originally to support agricultural lending and borrowing
# Mortgage Lending As Policy Goal

I. Mortgage lending has long history in US as policy goal

(A) Stretching back to Federal Housing Administration & Federal Home Loan Banks (Great Depression) and federal land banks (1916)

(B) Originally to support agricultural lending and borrowing

II. Federal National Mortgage Agency (FNMA, now known as Fannie Mae) chartered in 1938

(A) Owned by the gov't

(B) Role was to repurchase loans from banks, to provide liquidity in mortgage market

(C) Actually pretty important in highly fragmented and localized unit banking system - allowed unit banks to sell mortgages to wider market, access investors from across the country. Provide diversification not available to unit banks

III. Subsidized market in various ways

(A) Major: FNMA borrowed money at gov't rates - lower than commercial rates

# Fnma, Fannie Mae

Federal National Mortgage Agency (FNMA, now known as Fannie Mae) chartered in 1938

- Owned by the gov't
- Repurchase loans from banks, provide liquidity in mortgage market
- Important in highly fragmented and localized unit banking system - diversification
By 1960s, debt large, politicians wanted it "o balance sheet"
- "Privatized" 1968 - but not truly private
GSE: Government Sponsored Enterprise
- Also Freddie Mac
(FHLMC) , started 1971, privatized 1989
E orts - totally unsuccessful - to reform GSEs
- Subsidized in various ways
- GSEs borrow at gov't rates - lower than commercial rates
# Mortgage Lending - Fannie Mae

I. By 1960s, debt of FNMA large - gov't debt and it was crowding out other gov't debt

II. Solution? Move o balance sheet (a well-used trick). 1968

(A) "Privatized" in

1968. Split in two: GNMA (Ginnie Mae) gov't-owned, FNMA (Fannie Mae) "private"

III. GSE: Gov't Sponsored Enterprise

IV. Private shareholders, but not truly private. Many gov't benefits:

(A) Exempted from State & Local Taxes

(B) Exempt from SEC regulation

(C) Lax banking regulation

(D) Credit line from US Treasury

(E) Implicit guarantee of debt

1969. Gov't said it was not gov't debt. Nobody believed it. And indeed, in 2008, it became gov't debt

V. E orts to improve GSEs

VI. Freddie Mac - founded as "competition" for Fannie Mae

(A) 1971, FHLMC (Freddie Mac, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) started as government-owned

(B) 1989, Freddie Mac "privatized" but with same gov't privileges & subsidies

VII. Continuing e orts to reform GSEs

(A) There was widespread recognition and concern about GSE privileges and the distortions they introduced to the market

(B) When I was in mortgage market, easy to see the implicit subsidy

(C) Combination of forces (GSE managers, GSE shareholders, urban activists who benefited from GSE credit, politicians who benefited from support for their constituents - and campaign contributions) managed to defeat substantive reform - for decades, and still today

(D) 1992 GSE Act - instead of reforming, introduced problems

VIII. GSE Subsidies - Some Thoughts

(A) When I was in the mortgage market (1990s) everyone recognized the subsidy of and advantage for GSEs (Fannie & Freddie)

1970. Hard to miss

(B) Their debt was trading close to Treasuries rather than corporate bond or bank spreads

1971. The market was assessing their risk as gov't risk - implicit guarantee
1972. Result - they could borrow more cheaply than banks, could make more profit than private banks

(C) Inherently unfair, but not necessarily dangerous

1973. I recognized that it was unfair. I did not recognize the inherent danger
1974. Subsidy was unfair - enriched private shareholders at expense of taxpayers
1975. Inherent danger came from push by politicians to support credit expansion, lowering of credit standards

# Coalition Between Large Banks & Urban Activists

Collapse of populist / unit bank coalition, banks expand nationally

Cost savings. Benefits

Economies of scale (lower costs than unit banks)

Economies of scope (multiple products)

- Market
(monopoly) power
- Implicit (too-big-to-fail) and explicit (deposit insurance) protection that provides subsidies and distorts costs

# How Did "Urban Activists" Gain Leverage?

How did "urban activits" groups have leverage over banks?

Mergers required approval by Federal Reserve

- Banks must be "good citizens"
- Activist groups could bless or stall merger
CRA - Community Reinvestment Act
- Passed in
1977. Starting 1990s: CRA revisions, mergers.
	- Groups could use poor CRA rating to block.
One way to get CRA ratings - partner with urban activist groups
C&H document (pp 216-226) cooperation between large banks and urban activist groups
# Cra - Community Reinvestment Act

I. Passed in 1977, partly in response to claims banks discriminated against borrowers in low-income, inner-city areas

II. Before about mid-1990s, CRA was not very important

III. Starting 1990s, with revisions of CRA and increasing mergers, it started to become important

IV. For merger approval, banks had to prove they were "good citizens" - in practice meant they had to get good CRA ratings.

V. One way - partner with urban activist groups and direct lending towards low-income and inner-city areas

VI. C&H document (pp 216-226) cooperation between large banks and urban activist groups

# Digression On Inequality

Starting in 1980s, income inequality in US started to rise

- Late 20th c rise mirrored early 20th c fall
People focus on top $10\%$ or $1\%$
- More interesting: Wage & education gap: College 1.9x high-school - in 1980 1.3x
- Wage gap reflects simple supply & demand for skills
- Skill demand: Technological change - robust early & late 20th c

# Digression On Income Inequality

I. Starting in 1970s, income inequality in US started to rise back up. Interesting that this rise in the latter part of the 20th c mirrored the fall in the early part of the century.

(A) People often focus on top $10\%$ or $1\%$ - see picture from Saez (work by Piketty & Saez)

(B) Turns out there was a fall in the early 20th c, and the rise starting in the 1980s is a rise back to levels we saw in the early 20th c

(C) But more informative and more interesting is the wage gap - the split between earnings for high-school graduates and college graduates.

(D) Good evidence that both the early-20thc-fall and the late-20thc-rise have been due to the gap between highly-educated versus less-highly-educated workers: the inequality in earnings due to di erent worker skill level. (Other things clearly going on - urban-rural gaps, black-white gaps, capital-labor earnings - but the main issue appears to be wages & education. cf [?,?]

(E) This wage gap reflects simple supply & demand for skills

(F) Technological change – in both the early part and the late part of the century – increased demand for skilled workers.

(G) Early part of 20th c: education and human capital investment grew so much that it pushed down the wage gap. Later part of 20th c: we as a nation simply stopped making large investments in education and human capital.

# Alternate Take On "Redistribution" & "Urban Activists"

Calomiris & Haber make this move toward more banking for urban poor sound slightly malign I have slightly di erent take

- "Better Banking" or "Addressing urban poverty" instead of "redistribution"
- Older unit-banking system harmed urban poor – inadequate credit
C&H Fig 1.1 shows US low credit (R&R vs C&H)
- Good: policy goal to provide better access to credit
Bad: lower credit standards
- inform public policy with good economics
- Simple price theory: artificially low price $= >$ over-consumption
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/5003d4840523bcb9a44a3c24c3037856379b2a86951d6ee2ac1b6446efa455ac.jpg)

Notes: For reasons of readability, only selected country figures are shown on the table.
Alternate take: Calomiris & Haber talk about "redistribution" and "urban activists" - make it sound like something malign. I have a slightly di erent take on the issue
I. I think of "addressing urban poverty" rather than "redistribution"
(A) It is certainly true that low-income and inner-city groups were poorly-served by unit banking system
(B) System was structured to serve goals of rural populations (even if serving those expensively)
(C) Under unit banking, banking was expensive and opening in a low-income inner-city area was often not a profitable business decision
(D) As one example, in Chicago in the 1980s (and even now) there were many check-cashing services - where someone without a bank could cash a paycheck or government check. Chicago was poorly-banked, and inner city areas particularly so
II. Providing banking services to low-income and inner city populations is itself a good thing, and something not done well under unit banking structure
(A) To my mind, perfectly reasonable that groups in 1980s & 1990s (C&H's "urban activists") would push for better banking services
III. My sense is that, at least some of the "urban activists" and the politicians in the 1980s-2000s, saw better banking as addressing a root cause or urban poverty and inequality
(A) Not a foolish idea that poor access to credit could be a root cause for urban poverty and rising inequality
(B) C&H argue that a part - major part - of motive for political bargain was desire to ameliorate income inequality, largely among urban populations
(C) Problem was that policies adopted – reducing credit standards – produced terrible outcomes
IV. Distinction between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome
V. Whether motive is "redistribution" or "urban poverty", end result for the policies adopted was the same
(A) Misguided policies that
(B) Distorted incentives so that individuals - following incentives - built up large and unsustainable risks and
(C) Led to outcomes where everyone, low-income in particular, worse o
VI. Example of necessity of informing public policy with good economic theory and evidence - here arguing that reducing underwriting standards (mispricing risk) will increase systemic risk for banks without improving outcomes for urban poor.
(A) Simple price theory: artificially low price $= >$ over-consumption.
(B) With risk, over-consumption has serious consequences
# Urban Activists - Conclusion

My sense: coalition between banks & urban activists alone not enough to cause systemic breakdown

Calomiris & Haber spend much time laying out the coalition - and the rent-sharing (transfer to urban activist groups & constituents)

- pp 216-226
In the end I think this is valuable, but not the key ingredient
Expansion of coalition to bring in additional powerful groups is key
# 4 Intervention Of Politicians & Policy-Makers
# 4.1 Narrative & Coalition
# Contents
# 2008 Narrative Includes Politicians, Public, Gses

Think about the 6 interest groups laid out at beginning

NaN. Banks

NaN. Regulators

NaN. Other (urban activists)

NaN. GSEs (Fannie, Freddie)

NaN. Politicians

NaN. Public

- Start: Urban activists (supported by politicians & public) interested in alleviating poverty & inequality
- Direct redistribution not feasible (public opposition, US requires "supermajority")
- Increasing home-ownership seen as solution (long seen as route to stability and upward-mobility) But coalition expanded, motives changed:
Goal: alleviate poverty and inequality
- No direct redistribution or subsidy
Alternative: encourage home-ownership
- Flawed means: reduce down-payment requirements for home-owners, lower capital requirements for banks
- Benefits now flowed to middle class
- Politicians & public now members
- Banks & GSEs make high-risk loans only with gov't subsidies
# Intervention Of Politicians & Policy-Makers

Key ingredient: politicians & policy-makers altering the price of risk

- Encouraged everyone (bankers, shareholders, but most importantly middle-class home buyers) to over-consume risk
My sense: redistribution of rents from mergers
(above) would not (on its own) destroy the financial system
Mechanism for political intervention
- Fannie & Freddie received substantial subsidies.
- Even in the 1980s many thought subsidies should be removed
- Subsidies made Fannie & Freddie open to political influence – politicians could threaten to take them away

Large losses with small capital bu er (low Equity)

- Insolvency - default on the promise to depositors
Fundamental question for US & Subprime
- How & why did Risk & Capital?
High Risk and Low Capital: How & Why?
"Unit Banking" Crises Easy to Understand:
- Inherently fragile & crisis-prone: In a unit banking system with some 20,000 independent banks, the impact was bound to be uneven… and to threaten a chain reaction (F&S p 169)
I have more trouble with 2008 Sub-Prime
- Partly because we are closer - easier to understand the past
- I do not find C&H "Bank & Urban Activist" coalition fully convincing
1992 GSE Act - Started Reducing Credit Standards
Federal Housing Enterprise Safety and Soundness Act
Didn't remove subsidies – direct credit towards home ownership
Consistent with long-term government goals
Act Required HUD to develop a ordable housing goals
The sponsors of the GSE Act understood that the purpose of the mandates was to force Fannie and Freddie to lower their underwriting requirements and thereby lead private banks into originating loans to low-income urban constituents
The market influence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac extends well beyond the number of loans they buy or securitize; their underwriting standards for primary loans are widely adopted and amount to national underwriting standards for a substantial fraction of all mortgage loans [1991 HUD report]
Congress therefore mandated that Fannie and Freddie consider repurchasing mortgages with down payments of 5 percent or less and approving borrowers with histories of delinquent credit. [C&H p 235]

# Fannie & Freddie Were The Mechanism

1992 - Fannie & Freddie purchased 1 out of every 4 new mortgages

- Fannie & Freddie set the standard for mortgages in private market
- Congress (1992?) directed Fannie & Freddie to purchase $5\%$ -down mortgages, approve borrowers with bad histories
- $5\%$ -down mortgages did not then exist in conventional market
1994, Fannie & Freddie started buying $3\%$ down
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/ce4dde274d27d4ed9cc793186d4e8ef0d55bb66237dbbd1649322ca104e2ea92.jpg)
$3\%$ down mortgages exploded
"Congress therefore mandated that Fannie and Freddie consider repurchasing mortgages with down payments of 5 percent or less and approving borrowers with histories of delinquent credit. Importantly, it also directed Fannie and Freddie to 'a rmatively assist banks in meeting their CRA obligations.' [Calomiris and Haber(2015), 235]
# Digression - Some Mortgage Concepts & Terms Loan-To-Value

(Ltv) And % Down

- Borrowers generally have to put own money in - say $20\%$
This is $80\%$ LTV - higher LTV is more risky
- Provides cushion (for lender) if house price falls - house buyer absorbs first $20\%$ of loss
- During 1990s and 2000s, LTV went up from $80\%$ to (close to) $100\%$.
# Subprime & Alt-A - Various (Slightly Di Erent) Meanings

FICO (credit score) below 660

- Alt-A: generally characteristics of mortgage contract, such as high LTV, no documentation
- Key factor: default risk much higher than conventional mortgages
# Conventional Mortgage (Or "Conforming") - Lower Risk
- Meets requirements for guarantee or purchase by Fannie and Fredie
- Originally (pre-2000) a relatively safe (low LTV, well-documented) mortgage
# No-Doc Mortgage - Higher Risk
- Mortgage without income verification (e.g. pay stub, W-2)
- Extreme: NINJA: No Income, No Job, No Assets
# Starting In 1990S, Credit Standards Down High Risk Loans Exploded By 2006

Source: Acharya et al. ( ),. Note: High-risk mortgages are defined as subprime plus Alt-A mortgages.

# Lower Standards - Open To Everyone

Most important point - lower standards applied to everyone (non excludable good)

- Everyone, middle-class and wealthy, took on extra risk
- Subsidy larger for middle-class and wealthy
Homeowners subsidized through tax system and GSEs (lower mortgage rates)
- Deduct mortgage interest from taxes, pay lower rates (due to GSE subsidies)
Lower down-payment with large loan would increase the subsidy
- Say rate subsidy takes rate from $8\%$ to $5\%$
(exaggerated) • \$200 home, 80% LTV: \$40k down, \$160k mortgage, \$4.8k subsidy (160*0.03)
- Now lower to $5 \%$ down, $$ 40\mathrm{k}$ down can buy $$ 800\$ home, $$ 760$ mortgage (95% LTV), $$ 22.8\mathrm{k}$ subsidy
Subsidy to risk means borrowers have strong incentive to borrow more
- Bad for society (too much debt) and for individual (too much debt)
# Lower Standards - Open To Everyone

Borrowers doing nothing "wrong" - behaving according to incentives

- Importance of not interfering with incentives
(prices) # Important Points
- Opening credit to under-served groups not bad
Method of opening credit (reducing standards) was problem
- C&H example: Australia, first-time buyers receive subsidy toward down payment.
- Reduces LTV (makes loans less risky) in contrast with US in 2000s (increasing LTV, making loans risky)
The lunch might not have looked entirely free, but because taxpayers were picking up part of the tab, borrowers had an incentive to supersize their meals. The size of the interest-rate subsidy received by the borrower was a function of the size of the loan: the more a household was allowed to borrow at a favorable interest rate, the larger the subsidy it received. Thus borrowers seeking to expand the size of the implicit subsidy they received from the government faced strong incentives to maximize loanto-value ratios and loan-to-income ratios. [Calomiris and Haber(2015), 229]
 fn 50 For example, if a prospective mortgage borrower without government policy interventions would have had to pay, say, an 8 percent interest rate on a mortgage with a 97 percent loan-to-value ratio, but could borrow that amount at a 5 percent interest rate in the presence of government subsidies, then the implied subsidy would be nearly 3 percent of the value of the borrower's home per year. [Calomiris and Haber(2015), 229]
 fn 51 There are other ways to encourage home ownership that are less distortionary. For example, in Australia, first-time home buyers receive a government subsidy toward their down payments. The Australian housing subsidy program therefore helps first-time buyers to qualify for loans by reducing their loan-to-value ratios
(LTVs) —the opposite of the U. S. system. [Calomiris and Haber(2015), 229]
# Result: By 2006, Us Mortgages Hugely Risky
- By 2007,2 out of 5 new mortgages had down payment $3\%$ or less (LTV $97\%+$ )
- A 2006 survey found $46\%$ of first-time buyers put down no money at all, median buyer only $2\%$ (98% LTV)
As we discuss in the previous chapter, by 2007,2 out of every 5 new mortgages granted had a down payment of 3 percent or less. Amazingly, a 2006 survey done by the National Association of Realtors found that 46 percent of first-time home buyers put down no money at all, and the median firsttime buyer put down only 2 percent of the purchase price. [Calomiris and Haber(2015), 256]
# 4.3 Reducing Cost To Creditors, Increasing Return To Shareholders Contents
# Incentivizing Bank Shareholders – Lax Capital Standards Reducing Credit Standards Was One Part Of The Story
- Mandated (ordered by politicians)
- Embraced by public (you and me)
But why would banks take on higher-risk mortgages?
- Shareholders not foolish, recognized that mortgages more risky
Must pay shareholders more
- Will take on more risk only in return for higher return
One way to increase return is to allow banks to use more borrowed money (more leverage – lower capital)
- If loses pile up, just walk away
(default) and get nothing
- But if there are profits, get same dollar profit with less investment, higher return
- Incentive for banks to take risk: reduce the cost of taking on risk
- More borrowed money means lower capital ratio
Very crude example of shareholders borrowing:
- Put in \$100, get out either \$80 or \$120
- Case 1: borrow \$80, shareholders put in \$20.
Creditors: always get back \$80
- Shareholders: get either \$0 (lose 100%) or \$40 (win + 100%)
- Case 2: borrow \$90, shareholders put in \$10
- Creditors: get back \$80 or \$90
- Shareholders: get either \$0 (lose 100%) or \$30 (win +200%)

(taxpayers) pay to protect creditors
Bank deposit insurance
- Bank "too-big-to-fail" implicit guarantee
- Fannie & Freddie implicit debt guarantee
Value of subsidies varied by two criteria
- Larger banks got larger subsidies (large banks "too big to fail", smaller banks allowed)
- More debt, larger subsidy
- More debt higher chance of default more likely to use subsidy
In post-1990 America, banks and GSEs enjoyed the protection of government safety nets that guaranteed or otherwise reduced the de-fault risk of their debts. Those safety nets took the form of deposit insurance, access to Fed and FHLB lending, implicit guarantees of GSE debts, and implicit too-big-to-fail guarantees of bank debts that were not covered by deposit insurance. These safety nets should be thought of as subsidies: they allowed banks and GSEs to hold less capital and pay lower interest rates on their debts than they would have had to otherwise, because they reduced the risk of default on their debts and weakened the incentives of their creditors to monitor them and demand increases in equity capital.
The value of the subsidies provided by these government safety nets varied according to two criteria, producing some rather perverse incentives. First, the larger the bank or GSE, the larger the value of the safety net, and hence the larger the value of the subsidy. A small bank, one that was not too big to fail, received protection only from the deposit-insurance system. Indeed, in the case of insolvency, it could be taken over by the FDIC, which would guarantee its deposits and then arrange the sale of the bank to a competitor, thereby wiping out the shareholders and perhaps the bank's uninsured creditors.
Second, the more debt that a bank or GSE took on relative to its equity capital, the larger the value of the safety net, and hence the larger the subsidy. A metaphor from the circus perhaps makes the intuition clear: a safety net is not of much value to a high-wire performer if the wire is three feet above the ground. The higher the wire, the higher the value of the net. For a bank or GSE, the higher the leverage, the higher the default risk being borne by the government from protecting the debts. As the value of the safety-net subsidy rose with leverage, so did the share price of the bank or GSE that enjoyed that subsidy: the share price reflected the ability of the bank or GSE to borrow at an artificially low rate compared to the amount it would have had to pay on its debts without the government's backing0.2 Shareholders of banks and GSEs therefore were rewarded by the government safety net for having as little skin in the game as possible. In such a situation, shareholders may choose to maximize their leverage, pay a low rate of interest to their creditors, and then pocket the profits. This is a risky strategy because it is possible that shareholders will end up with nothing (if the value of the bank's assets declines sufficiently), but on average, higher leverage increases the rate of return to shareholders.
# Simple Merton Model Of Equity As Call
# Equity Is Call On Assets Of Company
- With low capital ratio, incentive for owners to take big bets
- Keep profits if win, but don't lose (creditors left with losses)
Creditors
(partially) protected by gov't subsidies & guarantees

# Calomiris & Haber Best I Have Seent
Calomiris & Haber's explanation best I've seen so far Based on a consistent view of the world, that looks at
- Long history
- Consistent framework for US 1830-1980 (unit banking) and 2000s (push to help underserved groups led to mispricing of risk)
- Across di erent regimes
- Britain - democracy
- Canada - democracy - with stable & ecient banking (relative to US)
- Brazil - decentralized autocracy for much of history
- Mexico - centralized autocracy for much of history
Comparison with Canada particularly important (chapter 9)
- Canada no systemic banking crises since
1840. US 12
    - Political institutions - that forestall populist coalitions - produce such an outcome
# Side Points
C&H least good in their "political coalitions" argument (economists not political scientists) They focus on "redistribution" whereas I would focus on "poverty reduction"
Their story cannot be complete - too US-centric:
- The 2007-2009 crisis was worldwide, with real estate problems in Britain, Ireland, Spain, Portugal... Still, it is the best I've heard so far.
# Not All Banks Took On Risk
A friend at JP Morgan in 2000s
- They wanted to buy 15&30yr conventional mortgages (relative safe) but had trouble finding
Goldman Sachs moved away from mortgages around 2006
How then do we account for that story that made the rounds in the summer of 2007? It concerns Goldman Sachs, the one Wall Street firm that was not, at that time, taking a hit for billions of dollars of suddenly devalued mortgage-backed securities. Reporters wanted to understand how Goldman had somehow sidestepped the disaster that had befallen everyone else. What they discovered was that in December 2006, Goldman's various indicators, including VaR and other risk models, began suggesting that something was wrong. Not hugely wrong, mind you, but wrong enough to warrant a closer look. (Joe Nocera, "Risk Management", NY Times Magazine, http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/magazine/04risk-t.html?_r=1&ref=business)
# Not All Banks Took On Risk
Easy to see in 2005 & 2006 that things were o
- spreads for AAA mortgage CDOs were $\mathrm{L} + {80}$ while AAA corporates $\mathrm{L} + {20}$.
People in the market knew the mortgages were risky. cf C&H $p_{266}$-269
C&H $p_{268}$ discuss Moody's data published 2005, showing Baa-rated mortgages default rates 10-times higher than Baa corporates
- I've mentioned a couple times my finding in 2005 that market spreads on AAA mortgage CDOs much wider than AAA corporates – everyone knew mortgages more risky
Any financial professional protesting that they purchased AAA-rated mortgage securities because they were convinced they were safe instruments either was disingenuous or not paying attention, arguably because they were blinded by the high pay they received in exchange for not questioning the ratings. (C&H p 268, quoting Barth, Caprio, Levine 2012)
# "Political" Problems
Don't down-play di culty of regulators imposing standards before any of us becomes too self-righteous about regulatory failure, ask yourself this: if you had been a prospective homeowner, how would you have reacted to the prospect of mortgage rates rising in 2006 or 2007 as a consequence of aggressive actions by regulators? Regulators are aware of the political environment in which they operate. (p 273)

# 1.1 Review & Overview
# Contents
# Remember Bank Runs, Diamond & Dybvig, Deposit Insurance
# Standard Story
- Banks inherently unstable
- Deposit
(liability) insurance "solves" problem of instability
# Diamond & Dybvig (1983) Classic Story Of Bank Runs
- Banks transform long-run illiquid assets into short-run liquid assets
- Inherently unstable and subject to runs
# Standard View - Deposit Insurance
(Di) Is:
- "part of a financial system safety net that promotes financial stability."
# "Heretical View": Di Serves Private Interests Of Banks, Borrowers, Depositors
- Introduced in US in 1933 to support & subsidize small & fragile banks
# Diamond & Dybvig Vs Calomiris & Jaremski
Diamond & Dybvig are the standard ("good") story about Deposit Insurance Calomiris & Jaremski present an alternative - dissenting - story
- Somewhat heretical - deposit insurance adopted pretty-much world-wide
- We have all been taught DI solves "bank run" problem
- Alternative - a "political story" to support weak and fragile banks
- I have become increasingly disenchanted with "Standard Story"
I'm afraid Calomiris & Jaremski are better supported by evidence Two theories of deposit insurance
I. "Economic": eliminates liquidity risk
(runs) . What we see in 1907,1930s
- May produce incentives to take too much risk - moral hazard
II. "Political" approach: outcome of political coalitions and bargaining, to shift rents and costs towards or away from bankers, depositors, borrowers, taxpayers
Theory, plus evidence from mid 1800s & 1910-1920s

# Diamond & Dybvig Model Produces Runs
Diamond & Dybvig p 14
Bank runs are a common feature of the extreme crises that have played a prominent role in [US] monetary history. During a bank run,
I. depositors rush to withdraw their deposits because they expect the bank to fail.
II. the sudden withdrawals can force the bank to liquidate many of its assets at a loss and to fail.
III. During a panic with many bank failures, there is a disruption of the monetary system and a reduction in production.
Why not Canada? Fragmented US banking with small banks

There is an Illiquid "Loan" - technology that increases investment, but takes time A "Bank" creates Liquid "Deposit" Asset - people can use it as money if they need

\end{tabular}

```

- Small fraction of population (25%) want to consume early
- At beginning nobody knows, so everybody wants a "liquid contract"
- "Liquid Contract" - pays below "fair" ($1.28, $1.813) but allows early withdrawal
- As long as $25\%$ withdraw, works. But two equilibria:
I. Good Equilibrium: Few (say $25\%$ ) use liquid asset at $t = 1$, The rest $(75\%)$ get more by waiting until $t = 2$.
II. Bank Run: Everybody (100%) tries to use liquid asset at $t = 1$. Only 78.125% get paid, the rest get nothing.

- Proposed ways to stop run:
I. Suspend "liquid" contract if more than $25\%$ try to withdraw
- 1893,1907 solution
3
II. Deposit Insurance
- Serious questions remain
[Diamond and Dybvig(1983), Diamond(2007)]:
Here's the set-up:
- Illiquid Asset exists
- T=1 pays \$1, T=2 pays \$2
- Consumers at Time 0 don't know their type:
- $25\%$ chance at $\mathbf{T} = 1$, need to consume, $75\%$ chance can wait until $\mathbf{T} = 2$
 - Consumers would prefer to have a "liquid asset" that pays T=1, $1.28, T=2, $1.813 (so they can consume \$1.28 if they turn out to be Type 1)
- Bank "creates" liquid asset, promising to pay §1.28 at T=1, §1.813 at T=2
- Everything works fine if $25\%$ actually use the contract at $\mathbf{T} = 1$:
Bank has \$1
25% of people want \$1.28, bank has to give away \$0.32 = 0.25*1.28.
Bank has \$0.68 left, this grows to 2*0.68 = \$1.36. Enough to pay \$1.813 to 75% (1.36/0.75 = 1.813)
- If $56.25\%$ of people get at $\mathbf{T} = 1$, this leaves only §1.28 for the rest at $\mathbf{T} = 2$.
- If $78.125\%$ of people get at $\mathrm{T} = 1$, the bank goes under: 0.78125*1.28 = 1.00
- A small fraction of the population want to consume early. But at the beginning nobody knows who that is, so everybody wants a "liquid contract"
- $25\%$ of population wants to consume early, but you only find out at period 1 (not 0)
- "Liquid Contract" allows anyone to get money early (less money) or late (more money).
- As long as not too many people use the "liquid contract" this works ok
- Bank may hold some cash, some loans (as in balance sheet above) or may sell o some loans (losing some but not too much money)
- But if too many people want liquid payout bank goes insolvent.
- So there are two equilibria:
I. Few (say 25%) use liquid asset at t=1 (get \$1.28), The rest (75%) get more by waiting until t=2 (\$1.36). Everything fine
II. Everybody tries to use liquid asset at $t = 1$. Only $78.125\%$ get paid, the rest get nothing. Bank goes insolvent
- Bank agrees to pay 1.28 for each contract at $t = 1$, but it only has 1.00 total.
- If more than $78.125\%$ of people do liquid contract, bank insolvent. 1.28*0.78125 = 1.00
- If more than $56.25\%$ of people get liquid payout, the rest get less than 1.28 (waiting until $t = 2$ get payout 2, and $1.28^{*}0.5625 = 0.72$, which leaves only $2^{*}0.28 = 0.56$ to be earned by the remaining $43.75\% = 100 - 56.25\%$ ). So everybody should try to get liquid payout. But only $78.125\%$ can do so
# 1.3 Calomiris & Jaremski - Heresy Re Deposit Insurance
# Contents
# Calomiris & Jaremski - Heresy Re Deposit Insurance

Standard (Diamond & Dybvig) view:

- "part of a financial system safety net that promotes financial stability."
Calomiris & Jaremski - Political theories: serving private interests of banks, borrowers, depositors
- Potentially at the expense of the public interest.
- Empirical evidence supports the private-interest approach
- Generally associated with increases, rather than decreases, in systemic risk.
- Prudential regulation generally not very ec tive in limiting systemic risk
- Likely reflects purposeful failures in regulation
- Little point to removing subsidies through strict regulation.
- The politics of liability insurance not narrowly interests of bankers - in many countries, pass-through subsidy targeted to bank borrowers.
# Why Deposits? "Delegated Monitoring"

What are deposits?

- Debt, but immediately redeemable: "on deposit"
- Importantly: first-come, first-served
- Unlike most corporate debt: upon default assets split among debt-holders
- For deposits, you get full amount as long as you are early in line
We have focused on use3fulness of Deposits as "Money" & "Liquidity" but Calomiris & Jaremski also focus on "Delegated Monitoring"
- C&J argue that principal-agent conflicts – bankers select loans and manage risk, but depositors cannot immediately observe banker behavior and e ort – can make deposit structure valuable
- Short-dated debt gives the right to depositors to pull out at any time
- Longer-dated debt would mean depositors might get stuck
- But, why doesn't this apply to other companies as well?
- Maybe because banks deal with money, not steel or cars or iPhones, and money is so much easier to steal and hide and misuse
"Delegated Monitoring": Depositors want to pull out to quickly to escape trouble
- This imposes discipline on banks and bankers
# Deposits Can Be Socially Costly - Liquidity Runs

Deposits as mechanism to impose discipline has social costs

- Bank runs impose big costs - collapse of banking system
1907 exhibits those costs – recession was bad but not horrible before the bank run in October 1907
- Same thing in Great Depression 1930-33: it was bad but nothing horrible until banks started failing: 1st Banking Crisis (Oct 1930), 2nd Banking Crisis (March 1931), 3rd Banking Crisis (1933, January-March)
# Mechanisms To Protect Against Liquidity Risk

Reserves as Basic Protection.

- Holding some fraction of cash as bu er to pay out immediately
To be e ective, must stabilize & diversify
Two ways to stabilize & diversify:
I. Large diversified bank - internal stabilization & diversification
- Stabilization: many depositors (law of large numbers smooths depositor shocks)
- Diversification: Depositors from di erent regions (reduce correlation of asset shocks and depositor shocks)
- Reduces lumpiness of cash and can move cash around the country
II. Deposit insurance - external stabilization & diversification
- Smaller banks pooling resources across banks
But deposit insurance does not allow e cient stabilization & diversification - playing with Other People's Money
# Deposit Insurance: Moral Hazard & Averse Selection

Moral Hazard: playing with other people's money

- Deposit insurance pools money across different banks
- Allows me and my bank to play with money of other banks (or taxpayers)
- I can take on risk and if I lose, the pool of outside money bails me out
- Introduces incentive to take on risk
Adverse Selection: bad banks take insurance
- Those with poor risk & high costs want insurance
- Specifically small, in cient banks with high risk of runs
Deposit Insurance: Competing forces
- Reduces social cost of runs
- Pool of money reduces chance of runs
- Introducing moral hazard / adverse selection and too much risk
- May increase probability of runs
Not clear which will win
- Evidence seems to indicate Moral Hazard & Adverse Selection
# 1.4 Evidence For Increased Costs & Instability
# Contents
# Pre Civil War Liability Insurance

Calomiris & Haber Fragile by Design Chapter 6, p. 174

Six Northern states - two di erent approaches

I. "Good" system: Indiana, Ohio, Iowa

- Small number of banks, unlimited liability, self-regulatory oversight
- Provided both incentive and means to monitor and enforce good behavior – not allowing members to take excessive risk
II. "Bad" system: New York, Michigan, Vermont
Large number of banks, limited liability, weak external regulation
- Provided incentive for members to take more risk (moral hazard)
- Removed cost of more risk (insurance scheme would pay back depositors)
- Did not impose costs (say regulatory constraints) for taking risk
No surprise:
(2) collapsed with outstanding claims, surviving members exited
(1) survived, providing low risk and mutual protection. Survived until new laws in 1860s pushed banks to convert to national bank charters
# Evidence 1920S

Calomiris & Haber Fragile by Design Chapter 6, p. 187, Calomiris & Jaremski

(NBER) , Calomiris & Jaremski

(JFinance) - Fundamentally di erent approach from Fragile by Design - quantitative econometrics (and good)

1908-1917, eight states created deposit insurance of "bad" type

During 1920s, many bank failures

1921-1929,5,712 failures

- Losses worse for deposit insurance states
"Despite being subject to similar exogenous shocks, the insured banking system collapses exhibited much higher loan losses than national banks within the same states or state-chartered banks operating in adjacent states"

# Description Of Bank Insurance

Deposit

(Liability) Insurance - The "bad" kind

- Including many (all or most) State Banks
National vs State Banks
- National Banks: Chartered by Federal, regulated by O ce of the Comptroller of the Currency
- Generally larger, better regulated, better capitalized, more urban
- State Banks: Charter by states, regulated by states
- Generally smaller, less well-capitalized, rural
- National Banks not eligible for state insurance schemes

# "Identification" Issues: Unobserved Or Confounding Variables

Fundamental issue in economic and all scientific reasoning

Need variation in observables to measure e etc

Here, insured vs non-insured, to see where failures higher

But need variation unrelated to underlying causes

- Maybe a state chooses insurance because the state is inherently more risky (agricultural vs industrial)
Two "levels" of concern:
- Observables: variables that we can measure that are correlated
Slides from summer program
# Correlation: What We Measure
# Causation: What We Care About
- We measure correlation: how one thing moves with another
- We often care about causality: how one thing causes another
# Correlation Does Not Imply Causation

# We Need Causation To Change The World

The reason we seek causal explanations is in order to intervene, to govern the cause so as to govern the e etc: "Policy-thinking is and must be causality-thinking." (Tufte & Dahl, Tufte p 6)

# Examples Will Explain This

The reason we seek causal explanations is in order to intervene, to govern the cause so as to govern the e etc: "Policy-thinking is and must be causality-thinking." ([Tufte(1997a), Tufte(1997b)] p. 6 / 28, quoting Robert A. Dahl, "Cause and E etc in the Study of Politics," in Danial Lerner, ed., Cause and E etc.)

# Cats, Rats, And Plague

Plague came to London in 1665

- Recurrence of Bubonic Plague (the "Black Death") that originally arrived in Britain in 1348 and killed roughly $40 - 60\%$ of the population
Caused by bacteria Yersinia pestis:
- Infects rats - fleas
- Fleas get bloated, bite someone, spit up balls of bacteria infection
- When rats die, fleas jump to humans - plague among humans

Today we have a theory, a causal mechanism for the how & why of plague
- When rat population increases, plague likely to increase
- To reduce infection, reduce rats (& bites by fleas)

Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) infected with the Yersinia pestis bacterium which appears as a dark mass in the gut. The foregut of this flea is blocked by a Y. pestis biofilm; when the flea attempts to feed on an uninfected host, Y. pestis from the foregut is regurgitated into the wound, causing infection.

# Drawing The Cats, Rats, And Plague Relationship

But now think about cats: Mutual causality

- Cats hunt rats, so more rats means more food
- When rat population cat population
- Causal e etc can go other way: cats hunt rats, control population
Let's draw a simple diagram of the cat, rat, and plague relationship
Rats & fleas
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-15/c441f5b5-2f9d-4e4d-bc65-1301c02e96db/9f5a463a1121093a06fa47ab8cc877bafefe870dbedc629cee333b14d06d51f8.jpg)
Rats & fleas cause plague
- We know this, studying rats, fleas, bacteria
- We put Rats & fleas at the top
Solid line Rats Plague: represents causality
Mutual causality (both ways) between cats & rats
- More rats more cats
- But cats help control rat population
# Correlation Vs Causation: Bad Outcome

Rats & fleas cause plague

- We know this, studying rats, fleas, bacteria
- We put Rats & fleas at the top
Solid line Rats Plague: represents causality
Mutual causality (both ways) between cats & rats
- More rats more cats
- But cats help control rats
Creates correlation between cats & plague (through rats)
- Cats below, dotted line for observed correlation
In 1665, no understanding of the causal mechanism, no correct theory
Some smart person saw correlation between cats & plague:
- More cats, more plague
- Decided cats caused plague, so killed the cats
# Kill The Cats, Increase The Plague

Wherefore were we ordered to kill all the dogs and cats…. It is incredible… what a prodigious number of those creatures were destroyed. (Daniel Defoe, wonderful English author, Journal of the Plague Year)

What do you think happened?

- No cats to hunt rats
Rat population grew fast
- Plague worse
Wonderful story showing the disasters that occur, the unintended consequences, when we mistake correlation (cats & plague) for causation (rate & fleas Plague)
# Cats & Rats

Correlation alone is not su cient

- Need an understanding plague as a disease with fleas as the vector
- Except maybe it's not fleas. [Greshko(2018), Bates and Salkeld(2011)]
# Comment On Daniel Defoe

Merchant, spy. Spent time in prison for political agitation and also for debts. And one of the great English novelists. Author of *Robinson Crusoe*, "second only to the bible in translations". Journal of the *Plague Year*, an amazing chronicle of the Great Plague of London in

1665. And one of my favorite novels, *Moll Flanders* – the story of the truly amoral but wonderful title character: "the fall and eventual redemption, both material and spiritual, of a lone woman in 17th-century England."

# Minor Problem - Story Not True (But It Should Be)
- It'sa great story, but probably not true
- No evidence that anyone measured correlation between cats & plague
- Cats & dogs killed ("according to the advice of physicians") but probably for other reasons ("carrying the infectious streams even in their furs and hair")
# But It Illustrates The Whole Point Of This Course
- We can easily observe correlation (cats & plague move together)
- Much harder to uncover causation (discover bacteria, study flea life-cycle and feeding behavior, map and study epidemic outbreaks)
- But causation matters - sometimes literally life & death
# Path To Causation Hard:
- True story - John Snow and cholera - to learn
# 1.6 Variation & Confounding In Calomiris & Jaremski
# Contents
# Three Identification

(Causality) Issues

1. DI vs non-DI states: structural di erences
	- Variation: DI states had more failures, worse losses
	- Confounding: Maybe DI states were more risky - agricultural vs industrial
	- Control: Compare DI vs non-DI states prior to enacting DI laws and find similarities
2. Unobserved shocks to DI states causing DI laws
	- Variation: DI states had more failures, worse losses
	- Confounding: Maybe specific events occurred in the DI states that pushed them to pass liability laws
Control:
	- Observables: economic and demographic variables (including time fixed ects) that would "soak up" changes
	- Unobservables: Compare DI State Banks with non-DI National Banks and non-DI State Banks in the same state, that would experience the same shocks. Similar
3. National vs State Bank structural di erences
	- Variation: Within DI states, insured banks had more failures, worse losses versus uninsured banks
	- Confounding: National Banks could not insure, and maybe they were inherently less risky than State Banks – we incorrectly interpret National vs State Bank differences as non-DI vs DI differences
	- Control: Compare DI vs non-DI State Banks across states to control for (measure di erences due to) unobserved variables specific to State Banks vs National Banks.
Econometrically, called "Di erence-in-Di erences-in-Di erences"
# Results - Deposit Insurance Increased Risk

Calomiris & Jaremski

(JoF) focus on two hypotheses:

I. Insured banks should "steal" deposits from uninsured banks (able to o er more attractive terms)

II. Insured banks should use deposits to fund more risk lending (because DI subsidizes risky lending)

1900-1920: Start and Growth of DI Systems

- Laws passed in 1908
(Oklahoma) 1909 (Kansas, Texas), 1911
(Nebraska) , South Dakota (1916), North Dakota (1918)
- Period of growth in agricultural prices, growth in lending
- Evidence that insured banks both grew faster (more deposits and loans) and with more risk (lower capital-to-assets and lower cash-to-assets)
# Results - Worse Collapse

When the Bubble Burst

- Agricultural prices fell, starting 1920
Deposit Insurance could have either e etc:
I. Cushion state banking system by reducing incentive for runs
II. Make collapse worse by encouraging higher risk (also when depositors realize fund out of money, worse runs – funds not state-guaranteed)
Deposit Insurance did not cushion state banks
- All systems suspended during 1920s
- All except Texas produced depositor losses
- Insurance states had worse contraction of deposits and loans
- Many banks left the insurance system (converted to National banks)
C&H page 188
[Calomiris and Jaremski(2019)]
# Deposit Insurance Conclusion - Subsidy For Small Banks
- Calomiris & Jaremski conclude that deposit insurance should be viewed as a political mechanism that transfers to particular groups
- For unit banking in 1800s & 1900s, it was a mechanism to fix the problem of fragile unit banks
- Allowed unit banks to survive
- Could lead to increased failures and larger losses
Modern Deposit Insurance schemes often di erent
- State backing (unlike 1900-1920 systems) so don't run out of money
- More recently, better risk-weighting (higher premiums for more risk activity)
But Calomiris & Jaremski
(NBER) convincingly argue that "political theory" better supported by evidence than "economic theory"
- Argue that DI as subsidy and targeted support (borrowers, depositors) helps explain adoption around the world (since 1930s)
