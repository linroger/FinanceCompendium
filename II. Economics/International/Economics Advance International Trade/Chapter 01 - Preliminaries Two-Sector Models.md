# Chapter 1: Preliminaries: Two-Sector Models

We begin our study of international trade with the classic Ricardian model, which has two goods and one factor (labor). The Ricardian model introduces us to the idea that technological differences across countries matter. In comparison, the Heckscher-Ohlin model dispenses with the notion of technological differences and instead show how factor endowments form the basis for trade. While this may be fine in theory, it performs very poorly in practice: as we show in the next chapter, the Heckscher-Ohlin model is hopelessly inadequate as an explanation for historical or modern trade patterns unless we allow for technological differences across countries. For this reason, the Ricardian model is as relevant today as it has always been. Our treatment of it in this chapter is a simple review of undergraduate material, but we will have the opportunity to refer to this model again at various places throughout the book.

After reviewing the Ricardian model, we turn to the two-good, two-factor model which occupies most of this chapter and forms the basis of the Heckscher-Ohlin model. We shall suppose that the two goods are traded on international markets, but do not allow for any movements of factors across borders. This reflects the fact that the movement of labor and capital across countries is often subject to controls at the border and generally much less free than the movement of goods. Our goal in the next chapter will be to determine the pattern of international trade between countries. In this chapter, we simplify things by focusing primarily on one country, treating world prices as given, and examine the properties of this two-by-two model. The student who understands all the properties of this model has already come a long way in his or her study of international trade.

# Ricardian Model

Indexing goods by the subscript i, let  $a_i$  denote the labor needed per unit of production of each good at home, while  $a_i^*$  is the labor need per unit of production in the foreign country,  $i = 1,2$ . The total labor force at home is  $L$  and abroad is  $L^*$ . Labor is perfectly mobile between the industries in each country, but immobile across countries. This means that both goods are produced in the home country only if the wages earned in the two industries are the same. Since the marginal product of labor in each industry is  $1 / a_i$ , wages are equalized across industries if and only if  $p_1 / a_1 = p_2 / a_2$ , where  $p_i$  is the price in each industry. Letting  $p = p_1 / p_2$  denote the relative price of good 1 (using good 2 as the numeraire), this condition is  $p = a_1 / a_2$ .

These results are illustrated in Figure 1.1(a) and (b), where we graph the production possibility frontiers (PPF's) for the home and foreign countries. With all labor devoted to good i at home, it can produce $\mathrm{L /a_i}$ units, $i = 1,2$, so this establishes the intercepts of the PPF, and similarly for the foreign country. The slope of the PPF in each country is then $\mathrm{a_1 /a_2}$ and $\mathrm{a_1^* /a_2^*}$. Under autarky (i.e. no international trade), the equilibrium relative prices $\mathsf{p}^{\mathrm{a}}$ and $\mathsf{p}^{\mathrm{a}^*}$ must equal these slopes in order to have both goods produced in both countries, as argued above. Thus, the autarky equilibrium at home and abroad might occur at points A and A*. Suppose that the home country has a comparative advantage in producing good 1, meaning that $\mathrm{a_1 /a_2 <a_1^* /a_2^*}$. This implies that the home autarky relative price of good 1 is lower than that abroad.

Now letting the two countries engage in international trade, then what is the equilibrium price $p$ at which world demand equals world supply? To answer this, it is helpful to graph the world relative supply and demand curves, as illustrated in Figure 1.2. For the relative price satisfying  $p < p^a = a_1 / a_2$  and  $p < p^{a*} = a_1^* / a_2^*$ , both countries are fully specialized in good 2 (since wages earned in that sector are higher), so the world relative supply of good 1 is zero. For  $p^a < p < p^{a*}$ , the home country is fully specialized in good 1 whereas the foreign country is still specialized in good 2, so that the world relative supply is  $(L / a_1) / (L^* / a_2^*)$ , as labeled in Figure 1.2. Finally, for  $p > p^a$  and  $p > p^{a*}$ , both countries are specialized in good 1. So we see that the world relative supply curve has a "stair-step" shape, which reflects the linearity of the PPF's.

To obtain world relative demand, let us make the simplifying assumption that tastes are identical and homothetic across the countries. Then demand will be independent of the distribution of income across the countries. Demand being homothetic means that relative demand  $\mathrm{d}_1 / \mathrm{d}_2$  in either country is a downward-sloping function of the relative price  $\mathfrak{p}$ , as illustrated in Figure 1.2. In the case we have shown, relative demand intersects relative supply at the world price  $\mathfrak{p}$  that lies between  $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{a}}$  and  $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{a}*}$ , but this does not need to occur: instead, we can have relative demand intersect one of the flat-segments of relative supply, so that the equilibrium price with trade equals the autarky price in one country.

Focusing on the case where  $p^a < p < p^{a*}$ , we can go back to the PPF's of each country and graph the production and consumption points with free trade. Since  $p > p^a$ , the home country is fully specialized in good 1 at point B, as illustrated in Figure 1.1(a), and then trades at the relative price  $p$  to obtain consumption at point C. Conversely, since  $p < p^{a*}$  the foreign

country is fully specialized in the production of good 2 at point  $\mathbf{B}^*$ , in Figure 1.1(b), and then trades at the relative price p to obtain consumption at point  $\mathbf{C}^*$ . Clearly, both countries are better off under free trade than they were in autarky: trade has allowed them to obtain a consumption point that is above the PPF.

Notice that the home country exports good 1, which is in keeping with its comparative advantage in the production of that good,  $\mathsf{a}_1 / \mathsf{a}_2 < \mathsf{a}_1^* / \mathsf{a}_2^*$ . Thus, trade patterns are determined by comparative advantage, which is a deep insight from the Ricardian model. This occurs even if one country has an absolute disadvantage in both goods, such as  $\mathsf{a}_1 > \mathsf{a}_1^*$  and  $\mathsf{a}_2 > \mathsf{a}_2^*$ , so that more labor is needed per unit of production of either good at home than abroad. The reason that it is still possible for the home country to export is that its wages will adjust to reflect its productivities: under free trade, its wages are lower than those abroad. Thus, while trade patterns in the Ricardian model are determined by comparative advantage, the level of wages across countries is determined by absolute advantage.

# Two-Good, Two-Factor Model

Focusing now on a single country, we will suppose that it produces two goods with the production functions  $y_{i} = f_{i}(L_{i}, K_{i})$ ,  $i = 1,2$ , where  $y_{i}$  is the output produced using labor  $L_{i}$  and capital  $K_{i}$ . These production functions are assumed to be increasing, concave, and homogeneous of degree one in the inputs $(L_{i}, K_{i})$. The last assumption means that there is constant returns to scale in the production of each good. This will be a maintained assumption for the next several chapters, but it should be pointed out that it is rather restrictive. It has long been thought that increasing returns to scale might be an important reason to have trade between countries: if a firm with increasing returns is able to sell in a foreign market, this expansion of output will bring a reduction in its average costs of production, which is an indication of greater efficiency. Indeed, this was a principal reason that Canada entered into a free trade agreement with the United States in 1989: to give its firms free access to the large American market. We will return to these interesting issues in chapter 5, but for now, ignore increasing returns to scale.

We will assume that labor and capital are assumed to be fully mobile between the two industries, so we are taking a "long run" point of view. Of course, the amount of factors employed in each industry is constrained by the endowments found in the economy. These resource constraints are stated as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{L}_{1} + \mathrm{L}_{2} \leq \mathrm{L}, \tag {1.1} \\ \mathrm{K}_{1} + \mathrm{K}_{2} \leq \mathrm{K}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where the endowments  $\mathrm{L}$  and  $\mathrm{K}$  are fixed. Maximizing the amount of good 2,  $y_{2} = f_{2}(L_{2}, K_{2})$ , subject to a given amount of good 1,  $y_{1} = f_{1}(L_{1}, K_{1})$ , and the resource constraints in (1.1) gives us  $y_{2} = h(y_{1}, L, K)$ . The graph of  $y_{2}$  as a function of  $y_{1}$  is shown as the PPF in Figure 1.3. As drawn,  $y_{2}$  is a concave function of  $y_{1}$ ,  $\partial^{2}h(y_{1}, L, K) / \partial y_{1}^{2} < 0$ . This familiar result follows from the fact that the production functions  $f_{i}(L_{i}, K_{i})$  are assumed to be concave. Another way to express this is to consider all points  $S = (y_{1}, y_{2})$  that are feasible to produce given the resource constraints in (1.1). This production possibilities set  $S$  is convex, meaning that if  $y^{a} = (y_{1}^{a}, y_{2}^{a})$

and  $y^b = (y_1^b, y_2^b)$  are both elements of  $S$ , then any point between them  $\lambda y^a + (1 - \lambda)y^b$  is also in  $S$ , for  $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$ .

The production possibilities frontier summarizes the technology of the economy, but in order to determine where the economy produces on the PPF we need to add some assumptions about the market structure. We will assume perfect competition in the product markets and factor markets. Furthermore, we will suppose that product prices are given exogenously: we can think of these prices as established on world markets, and outside the control of the "small" country being considered.

# Gdp Function

With the assumption of perfect competition, the amounts produced in each industry will maximize gross domestic product (GDP) for the economy: this is Adam Smith's "invisible hand" in action. That is, the industry outputs of the competitive economy will be chosen to maximize GDP:

$$
\mathrm{G} \left(\mathrm{p}_{1}, \mathrm{p}_{2}, \mathrm{L}, \mathrm{K}\right) = \max_{\mathrm{y}_{1}, \mathrm{y}_{2}} \mathrm{p}_{1} \mathrm{y}_{1} + \mathrm{p}_{2} \mathrm{y}_{2} \quad \text{s .t .} \quad \mathrm{y}_{2} = \mathrm{h} \left(\mathrm{y}_{1}, \mathrm{L}, \mathrm{K}\right). \tag {1.2}
$$

To solve this problem, we can substitute the constraint into the objective function and write it as choosing  $y_1$  to maximize  $p_1y_1 + p_2h(y_1,L,K)$ . The first-order condition for this problem is  $p_1 + p_2(\partial h / \partial y_1) = 0$ , or,

$$
p = \frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}} = - \frac{\partial h}{\partial y_{1}} = - \frac{\partial y_{2}}{\partial y_{1}}. \tag {1.3}
$$

Thus, the economy will produce where the relative price of good 1,  $p = p_1 / p_2$ , is equal to the slope of the production possibilities frontier. This is illustrated by the point A in Figure 1.4, where the line tangent through point A has the slope of (negative)  $p$ . An increase in this price will raise the slope of this line, leading to a new tangency at point B. As illustrated, then, the economy will produce more of good 1 and less of good 2.

The GDP function introduced in (1.2) has many convenient properties, and we will make use of it throughout this book. To show just one property, suppose that we differentiate the GDP function with respect to the price of good  $i$ , obtaining:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf {G}}{\partial p_{i}} = \mathbf {y}_{i} + \left(p_{1} \frac{\partial \mathbf {y}_{1}}{\partial p_{i}} + p_{2} \frac{\partial \mathbf {y}_{1}}{\partial p_{i}}\right). \tag {1.4}
$$

It turns out that the terms in parentheses on the right of (1.4) sum to zero, so that  $\partial G / \partial p_i = y_i$ . In other words, the derivative of the GDP function with respect to prices equals the outputs of the economy. The fact that the terms in parentheses sum to zero is an application of the "envelope theorem," which states that when we differentiate a function that has been maximized (such as GDP) with respect to an exogenous variable (such as  $p_i$ ), then we can ignore the changes in the endogenous variables ( $y_1$  and  $y_2$ ) in this derivative. To prove that these terms sum to zero, totally differentiate  $y_2 = h(y_1, L, K)$  with respect to  $y_1$  and  $y_2$  and use (1.3) to obtain  $p_1 dy_1 = -p_2 dy_2$ , or  $p_1 dy_1 + p_2 dy_2 = 0$ . This equality must hold for any small movement in  $y_1$  and  $y_2$  around the PPF, and in particular, for the small movement in outputs induced by the

change in  $\mathfrak{p}_{\mathrm{i}}$ . In other words,  $\mathrm{p}_1(\partial \mathrm{y}_1 / \partial \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}}) + \mathrm{p}_2(\partial \mathrm{y}_2 / \partial \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}}) = 0$ , so the terms in parentheses on the right of (1.4) vanish and it follows that  $\partial \mathrm{G} / \partial \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{i}}$ .

# Equilibrium Conditions

We now want to state succinctly the equilibrium conditions to determine factor prices and outputs. It will be convenient to work with the unit-cost functions that are dual to the production functions  $\mathrm{f_i(L_i,K_i)}$ . These are defined by:

$$
c_{i} (w, r) = \min_{L_{i}, K_{i} \geq 0} \left\{w L_{i} + r K_{i} \mid f_{i} \left(L_{i}, K_{i}\right) \geq 1 \right\}. \tag {1.5}
$$

In words,  $c_{i}(w,r)$  is the minimum cost to produce one unit of output. Because of our assumption of constant returns to scale, these unit-costs are equal to both marginal costs and average costs. It is easily demonstrated that the unit-cost functions  $c_{i}(w,r)$  are non-decreasing and concave in  $(w,r)$ . We will write the solution to the minimization in (1.5) as  $c_{i}(w,r) = w a_{iL} + r a_{iK}$ , where  $a_{iL}$  is optimal choice for  $L_{i}$ , and  $a_{iK}$  is optimal choice for  $K_{i}$ . It should be stressed that these optimal choices for labor and capital depend on the factor prices, so that they should be written in full as  $a_{iL}(w,r)$  and  $a_{iK}(w,r)$ . However, we will usually not make these arguments explicit.

Differentiating the unit-cost function with respect to the wage, we obtain:

$$
\frac{\partial c_{i}}{\partial w} = a_{i L} + \left(w \frac{\partial a_{i L}}{\partial w} + r \frac{\partial a_{i K}}{\partial w}\right). \tag {1.6}
$$

As we found with differentiating the GDP function, it turns out that the terms in parentheses on the right of (1.6) sum to zero, which is again an application of the “envelope theorem.” It follows that the derivative of the unit-costs with respect to the wage equals the labor needed for one unit of production, $\partial c_{\mathrm{i}} / \partial \mathrm{w} = a_{\mathrm{iL}}$. Similarly, $\partial c_{\mathrm{i}} / \partial \mathrm{r} = a_{\mathrm{iK}}$.

To prove this result, notice that the constraint in the cost-minimization problem can be written as the isoquant $\mathrm{f_i(a_{iL},a_{iK})} = 1$. Totally differentiate this to obtain $\mathrm{f_{iL}da_{iL} + f_{iK}da_{iK}} = 0$, where $\mathrm{f_{iL}}\equiv \partial \mathrm{f_i} / \partial \mathrm{L_i}$ and $\mathrm{f_{iK}}\equiv \partial \mathrm{f_i} / \partial \mathrm{K_i}$. This equality must hold for any small movement of labor $\mathrm{da_{iL}}$ and capital $\mathrm{da_{iK}}$ around the isoquant, and in particular, for the change in labor and capital induced by a change in wages. Therefore, $\mathrm{f_{iL}}(\partial \mathrm{a_{iL}} / \partial \mathrm{w}) + \mathrm{f_{iK}}(\partial \mathrm{a_{iK}} / \partial \mathrm{w}) = 0$. Now multiply this through by the product price $p_i$, noting that $p_i f_{iL} = w$ and $p_i f_{iK} = r$ from the profit-maximization conditions for a competitive firm. Then we see that the terms in parentheses on the right of (1.6) sum to zero.

The first set of equilibrium conditions for the two-by-two economy is that profits equal zero. This follows from free entry under perfect competition. The zero-profit conditions are stated as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} p_{1} = c_{1} (\mathrm{w}, \mathrm{r}), \tag {1.7} \\ \mathrm{p}_{2} = \mathrm{c}_{2} (\mathrm{w}, \mathrm{r}). \\ \end{array}
$$

The second set of equilibrium conditions is full-employment of both resources. These are the same as the resource constraints (1.1), except that now we express them as equalities. In addition, we will re-write the labor and capital used in each industry in terms of the derivatives of the unit-cost function. Since $\partial c_{\mathrm{i}} / \partial \mathrm{w} = a_{\mathrm{iL}}$ is the labor used for one unit of production, it follows that the total labor used in $\mathrm{L_i =y_ia_{iL}}$, and similarly the total capital used is $\mathrm{K_i =y_ia_{iK}}$. Substituting these into (1.1), the full-employment conditions for the economy are written as:

$$
\underbrace {a_{1 \mathrm{L}} y_{1}}_{\mathrm{L}_{1}} + \underbrace {a_{2 \mathrm{L}} y_{2}}_{\mathrm{L}_{2}} = \mathrm{L}, \tag {1.8}
$$

$$
\underbrace {\mathrm{a}_{1 \mathrm{K}} \mathrm{y}_{1}}_{\mathrm{K}_{1}} + \underbrace {\mathrm{a}_{2 \mathrm{K}} \mathrm{y}_{2}}_{\mathrm{K}_{2}} = \mathrm{K}.
$$

Notice that (1.7) and (1.8) together are four equations in four unknowns, namely,  $(\mathrm{w},\mathrm{r})$  and  $(\mathbf{y}_1,\mathbf{y}_2)$ . The parameters of these equation,  $\mathfrak{p}_1,\mathfrak{p}_2,\mathbb{L}$  and  $\mathbf{K}$ , are given exogenously. Because the unit-cost functions are nonlinear, however, it is not enough to just count equations and unknowns: we need to study these equations in detail to understand whether the solutions are unique and strictly positive, or not. Our task for the rest of this chapter will be to understand the properties of these equations and their solutions.

To guide us in this investigation, there are three key questions that we can ask: (i) what is the solution for factor prices; (ii) if prices change, how do factor prices change; (iii) if endowments change, how do outputs change? Each of these questions are taken up in the sections that follow. The methods we shall use follow the "dual" approach of Woodland (1977, 1982), Mussa (1979), and Dixit and Norman (1980).

# Determination of Factor Prices

Notice that our four equation system above can be decomposed into the zero-profit conditions as two equations in two unknowns – the wage and rental – and then the full-employment conditions, which involve both the factor prices (which affect $a_{iL}$ and $a_{iK}$) and the outputs. It would be especially convenient if we could uniquely solve for the factor prices from the zero-profit conditions, and then just substitute these into the full-employment conditions. This will be possible when the hypotheses of the following Lemma, are satisfied:

# Lemma (Factor Price Insensitivity)

So long as both goods are produced, and factor intensity reversals (FIR) do not occur, then each price vector $(\mathfrak{p}_1,\mathfrak{p}_2)$ corresponds to unique factor prices $(\mathrm{w},\mathrm{r})$

This is a remarkable result, because it says that the factor endowments (L,K) do not matter for the determination of (w,r). We can contrast this result with a one-sector economy, with production of  $y = f(L,K)$ , wages of  $w = pf_L$ , and diminishing marginal product  $f_{LL} < 0$ . In this case, any increase in the labor endowments would certainly reduce wages, so that countries with higher labor/capital endowments (L/K) would have lower wages. This is the result we normally expect. In contrast, the above Lemma says that in a two-by-two economy, with a fixed product price  $p$ , it is possible for the labor force or capital stock to grow without affecting their factor prices! Thus, Leamer (1995) refers to this result as "factor price insensitivity." Our goal in this section is to prove the result and also develop the intuition for why it holds.

Two conditions must hold to obtain this result: first, that both goods are produced; and second, that factor intensity reversals (FIR) do not occur. To understand FIR, consider Figures 1.5 and 1.6. In the first case presented in Figure 1.5, we have graphed the two zero-profit conditions, and the unit-cost lines intersect only once, at point A. This illustrates the Lemma: given  $(\mathfrak{p}_1,\mathfrak{p}_2)$ , there is a unique solution for  $(\mathrm{w},\mathrm{r})$ . But another case is illustrated in Figure 1.6, where the unit-cost lines intersect twice, at points A and B. Then there are two possible solutions for  $(\mathrm{w},\mathrm{r})$ , and the result stated in the Lemma no longer holds.

Figure 1.6

The case where the unit-cost lines intersect more than once corresponds to "factor intensity reversals." To see where this name comes from, let us compute the labor and capital requirements in the two industries. We have already shown that  $a_{iL}$  and  $a_{iK}$  are the derivatives of the unit-cost function with respect to factor prices, so it follows that the vectors  $(a_{iL}, a_{iK})$  are the gradient vectors to the iso-cost curves for the two industries in Figure 1.5. Recall from calculus that gradient vectors point in the direction of the maximum increase of the function in question. This means that they are orthogonal to their respective iso-cost curves, as shown by  $(a_{1L}, a_{1K})$  and  $(a_{2L}, a_{2K})$  at point A. Each of these vectors has slope  $a_{iK}/a_{iL}$ , or the capital-labor ratio. It is clear from Figure 1.5 that  $(a_{1L}, a_{1K})$  has a smaller slope than  $(a_{2L}, a_{2K})$ , which means that industry 2 is capital-intensive, or equivalently, industry 1 is labor-intensive.

In Figure 1.6, however, the situation is more complicated. Now there are two sets of gradient vectors, which we label by  $(\mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{K}})$  and  $(\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{K}})$  at point A and by  $(\mathrm{b}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{b}_{1\mathrm{K}})$  and  $(\mathrm{b}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{b}_{2\mathrm{K}})$  at point B. A close inspection of the figure will reveal that industry 1 is labor-intensive  $(\mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{K}} / \mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{L}} < \mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{K}} / \mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{L}})$  at point A but is capital-intensive  $(\mathrm{b}_{1\mathrm{K}} / \mathrm{b}_{1\mathrm{L}} > \mathrm{b}_{2\mathrm{K}} / \mathrm{b}_{2\mathrm{L}})$  at point B. This illustrates a "factor intensity reversal", whereby the comparison of factor intensities changes at different factor prices.

While FIR might seem like a theoretical curiosum, they are actually quite realistic. Consider the footwear industry, for example. While much of the footwear in the world is

produced in developing nations, the United States retains a small number of plants. In sneakers, New Balance has a plant in Norridgewock, Maine, where employers earn some \$14 per hour. Some operate computerized equipment with up to 20 sewing machine heads running at once, while others operate automated stitchers guided by cameras, that allow one person to do the work of six. This is a far cry from the plants in Asia that produce shoes for Nike, Reebock and other U.S. producers, using century-old technology and paying less than \$1 per hour. The technology used to make sneakers in Asia is like industry 1 at point A in Figure 1.5, using labor-intensive technology and paying low wages $\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{A}}$, while industry 1 in the U.S. is at point B, paying higher wages $\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{B}}$ and using a capital-intensive technology.

As suggested by this discussion, when there are two possible solutions for the factor prices such as points A and B in Figure 1.6, then some countries can be at one equilibrium and others countries at the other. How do we know which country is where? To answer this, it is necessary to consider the full-employment conditions: these will allow us to determine the factor prices prevailing in each country. Notice that we have now re-introduced a link between factor endowments (from the full-employment conditions) and factor prices, as we argued earlier in the one-sector model: when there are FIR in the two-by-two model, it will turn out that a labor-abundant country will be at an equilibrium like point A, paying low wages, while a capital-abundant country will be at an equilibrium like point B, paying high wages.

To establish this link between factor endowments and prices, we need to graph the full-employment conditions. We begin by re-writing these conditions in vector notation as:

$$
\binom {\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{IL}}} {\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{1K}}} \mathrm{y}_{1} + \binom {\mathrm{a}_{2 \mathrm{L}}} {\mathrm{a}_{2 \mathrm{K}}} \mathrm{y}_{2} = \binom {\mathrm{L}} {\mathrm{K}}. \tag {1.8'}
$$

We have already illustrated the gradient vectors  $(\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{iL}},\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{iK}})$  to the iso-cost curves in Figures 1.5 and 1.6. Now let us take these vectors and re-graph them, in Figures 1.7 and 1.8. In the simpler case of Figure 1.7, we have a single equilibrium for factor prices and a single set of labor and capital requirements  $(\mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{K}})$  and  $(\mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{K}})$ . Multiplying each of these by the output of their respective industries, we obtain the total labor and capital demands  $\mathbf{y}_1(\mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{K}})$  and  $\mathbf{y}_2(\mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{K}})$ . Summing these as in (1.8') we obtain the labor and capital endowments  $(\mathrm{L},\mathrm{K})$ . But this exercise can also be performed in reverse: for any endowment vector  $(\mathrm{L},\mathrm{K})$ , there will be a unique value for the outputs  $(\mathbf{y}_1,\mathbf{y}_2)$  such that when  $(\mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{K}})$  and  $(\mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{K}})$  are multiplied by these amounts, they will sum to the endowments.

How can we be sure that the outputs obtained from (1.8') are positive? It is clear from Figure 1.7 that the outputs in both industries will be positive if and only if the endowment vector  $(\mathrm{L},\mathrm{K})$  lies in-between the factor requirement vectors  $(\mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{K}})$  and  $(\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{K}})$ . For this reason, the space spanned by these two vectors is called a "cone of diversification", which we label by cone A in Figure 1.7. In contrast, if the endowment vector  $(\mathrm{L},\mathrm{K})$  lies outside of this cone, then it is impossible to add together any positive multiples of the vectors  $(\mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{K}})$  and  $(\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{K}})$  and arrive at the endowment vector. So if $(\mathrm{L},\mathrm{K})$ lies outside of the cone of diversification, then it must be that only one good is produced. At the end of the chapter, we will show how to determine which good it is. For now, we should just recognize that when only one good is produced, then factor prices are determined by the marginal products of labor and capital as in the one-sector model, and will certainly depend on the factor endowments. This is why the Lemma stated above requires that both goods are produced, or equivalently, that the endowments are inside the "cone of diversification."

Now consider the more complex case in Figure 1.8, where we have re-drawn the two sets of gradient vectors  $(\mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{K}})$  and  $(\mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{K}})$ , and  $(\mathbf{b}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{b}_{1\mathrm{K}})$  and  $(\mathbf{b}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathbf{b}_{2\mathrm{K}})$  from Figure 1.6, after multiplying each of them by the outputs of their respective industries. These vectors create two cones of diversification, labeled as cone A and cone B. Now we can answer the question of which factor prices will apply in any given country: a labor abundant economy, with a high ratio of labor/capital endowments such as  $(\mathbf{L}^{\mathrm{A}},\mathbf{K}^{\mathrm{A}})$  in cone A of Figure 1.8, will have factor prices given by  $(\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{A}},\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{A}})$  in Figure 1.6, with low wages; whereas a capital abundant economy with a high ratio of capital/labor endowments such as shown by  $(\mathbf{L}^{\mathrm{B}},\mathbf{K}^{\mathrm{B}})$  in cone B, will have factor prices given by  $(\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{B}},\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{B}})$ , with high wages. Thus, factor prices will depend on the endowments of the economy. A labor-abundant country such as China will pay low wages and a high rental (as in cone A). In contrast, a capital-abundant country such as the United States will have high wages and a low rental (as in cone B).

In summary, the "single cone" illustrated in Figures 1.5 and 1.7 show how we solve the zero-profit conditions (1.7) when there is a unique solution for the factor prices, and then use this solution in the full-employment conditions (1.8) to evaluate the  $a_{ij}$  coefficients and solve for outputs. In comparison, the "multi-cone" as presented in Figures 1.6 and 1.8 show that when there are multiple solutions for factor prices from the zero-profit conditions, then we also need to make use of the full-employment conditions to determine which factor prices prevail in each

country. Despite the complexity of the latter case, many trade economists feel that countries do in fact produce in different cones of diversification, and taking this possibility into account is a topic of current research. $^{10}$

Let us conclude this section by returning to the simple case of a single cone of diversification, in which the Lemma stated above applies. What are the implications of this result for the determination of factor prices under free trade? To answer this question, let us sketch out some of the assumptions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which we be study in more details in the next chapter. We assume that there are two countries, with identical technologies but different factor endowments. We continue to assume that labor and capital are the two factors of production, so that under free trade the equilibrium conditions (1.7) and (1.8) apply in each country with the same product prices  $(\mathsf{p}_1,\mathsf{p}_2)$ . With a single cone of diversification, we can draw Figures 1.5 and 1.7 for each country. Allowing factor endowments to differ across the countries will not affect the factor prices provided that both countries stay within the cone of diversification. In other words, the wage and rental determined by Figure 1.7 is identical in the two countries. We have therefore proved the Factor Price Equalization Theorem, which is stated as follows:

# Factor Price Equalization Theorem (Samuelson, 1949)

Suppose that two countries are engaged in free trade, having identical technologies but different factor endowments. If both countries are diversified and FIR do not occur, then the factor prices (w, r) are equalized across these countries.

To illustrate this result, we engage in a thought experiment posed by Samuelson (1949) and further developed by Dixit and Norman (1980). Initially, suppose that labor and capital are free to move between the two countries until their factor prices are equalized. Then all that matters for factor prices are the world endowments of labor and capital, and these are shown as the length of the horizontal and vertical axis in Figure 1.9. The amounts of labor and capital choosing to reside at home are measured relative to the origin 0, while the amounts choosing to reside in the foreign country are measured relative to the origin  $0^*$  - suppose that this allocation is at point B. Given the world endowments we establish equilibrium prices for goods and factors in this "integrated world equilibrium." The factor prices determine the demand for labor and capital in each industry, and using these, we can construct the diversification cone (since factor prices are the same across countries, then the diversification cone is also the same). Let us plot the diversification cone relative to the home origin 0, and again relative to the foreign origin  $0^*$ . These cones form the parallelogram  $0\mathrm{A}_10^*\mathrm{A}_2$ .

For later purposes, it is useful to identify precisely the points  $A_1$  and  $A_2$ , on the vertexes of this parallelogram. The vectors  $0A_i$  and  $0^*A_i$  are proportional to  $(a_{iL}, a_{iK})$ , the amount of labor and capital used to produce one unit of good  $i$  in each country. Multiplying  $(a_{iL}, a_{iK})$  by world demand for good  $i$ ,  $D_i^w$ , we then obtain the total labor and capital used to produce that good, so that  $A_i = (a_{iL}, a_{iK})D_i^w$ . Summing these gives the total labor and capital used in world demand, which equals the labor and capital used in world production, or world endowments.

Figure 1.9

Now we ask whether we can achieve exactly the same world production and equilibrium prices as in this "integrated world equilibrium," but without labor and capital mobility. Suppose there is some allocation of labor and capital endowments across the countries, such as point B. Then can we produce the same amount of each good as in the "integrated world equilibrium"? The answer is clearly yes: with labor and capital in each country at point B, we could devote  $0\mathrm{B}_1$  of resources to good 1 and  $0\mathrm{B}_2$  to good 2 at home, while devoting  $0^*\mathrm{B}_1^*$  to good 1 and  $0^*\mathrm{B}_2^*$  towards good 2 abroad. This will ensure that the same amount of labor and capital worldwide is devoted to each good as in the "integrated world equilibrium", so that production and equilibrium prices must be the same as before. Thus, we have achieved the same equilibrium but without factor mobility. It will become clear in the next chapter that there is still trade in goods going on to satisfy the demands in each country.

More generally, for any allocation of labor and capital within the parallelogram  $0\mathrm{A}_10^*\mathrm{A}_2$  both countries remain diversified (producing both goods), and we can achieve the same equilibrium prices as in the "integrated world economy." It follows that factor prices remain equalized across countries for allocations of labor and capital within the parallelogram  $0\mathrm{A}_10^*\mathrm{A}_2$ , which is referred to as the Factor Price Equalization (FPE) set. The FPE set illustrates the range of labor and capital endowments between countries for which factor price equalization is obtained. In contrast, for endowments outside of the FPE set such as point  $\mathbf{B}'$ , then at least one country would have to be fully specialized in one good and FPE no longer holds.

The FPE theorem is a remarkable result because it says that trade in goods has the ability to equalize factor prices: in this sense, trade in goods is a "perfect substitute" for trade in factors. We can again contrast this result with that obtained from a one-sector economy in both countries. In that case, equalization of the product price through trade would certainly not equalize factor

prices: the labor abundant country would be paying a lower wage. Why does this outcome not occur when there are two sectors? The answer is that the labor abundant country can produce more of, and export, the labor-intensive good. In that way it can fully employ its labor while still paying the same wages as a capital abundant country. In the two-by-two model, the opportunity to disproportionately produce more of one good than the other, while exporting the amounts not consumed at home, is what allows factor price equalization to occur. This intuition will become even clearer as we continue to study the Heckscher-Ohlin model in the next chapter.

# Change in Product Prices

Let us move on now to the second of our key questions of the two-by-two model: if the product prices change, how will the factor prices change? To answer this, we perform comparative statics on the zero-profits conditions (1.7). Totally differentiating these conditions, we obtain:

$$
\mathrm{dp}_{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{iL}} \mathrm{dw} + \mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{iK}} \mathrm{dr} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{dp}_{\mathrm{i}}}{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}}} = \frac{\mathrm{wa}_{\mathrm{iL}}}{\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}} \frac{\mathrm{dw}}{\mathrm{w}} + \frac{\mathrm{ra}_{\mathrm{iK}}}{\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}} \frac{\mathrm{dr}}{\mathrm{r}}, \mathrm{i} = 1, 2. \tag {1.9}
$$

The second equation is obtained by multiplying and dividing like terms, and noting that $p_i = c_i(w, r)$. The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to express the variables in terms of percentage changes, such as $d\ln w = dw / w$, as well as cost shares. Specifically, let $\theta_{iL} = w a_{iL} / c_i$ denote the cost share of labor in industry $i$, while $\theta_{iK} = r a_{iK} / c_i$ denotes the cost share of capital. The fact that costs equal $c_i = w a_{iL} + r a_{iK}$ ensures that the shares sum to unity, $\theta_{iL} + \theta_{iK} = 1$. In addition, denote the percentage changes by $dw / w = \hat{w}$ and $dr / r = \hat{r}$. Then (1.9) can be re-written as:

$$
\hat {\mathrm{p}}_{\mathrm{i}} = \theta_{\mathrm{iL}} \hat {\mathrm{w}} + \theta_{\mathrm{iK}} \hat {\mathrm{r}}, \quad \mathrm{i} = 1, 2. \tag {1.9'}
$$

Expressing the equation using these cost shares and percentage changes follows Jones (1965), and is referred to as the "Jones' algebra." This system of equation can be written in matrix form and solved as:

$$
\binom {\hat {p}_{1}} {\hat {p}_{2}} = \binom {\theta_{1 \mathrm{L}}} {\theta_{2 \mathrm{L}}} \binom {\theta_{1 \mathrm{K}}} {\theta_{2 \mathrm{K}}} \binom {\hat {\mathbf {w}}} {\hat {\mathbf {r}}} \Rightarrow \binom {\hat {\mathbf {w}}} {\hat {\mathbf {r}}} = \frac{1}{| \theta |} \binom {\theta_{2 \mathrm{K}}} {- \theta_{2 \mathrm{L}}} \binom {- \theta_{1 \mathrm{K}}} {\theta_{1 \mathrm{L}}} \binom {\hat {p}_{1}} {\hat {p}_{2}}, \tag {1.10}
$$

where  $|\theta|$  denotes the determinant of the 2x2 matrix on the left. This determinant can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left| \boldsymbol {\theta} \right| = \theta_{1 \mathrm{L}} \theta_{2 \mathrm{K}} - \theta_{1 \mathrm{K}} \theta_{2 \mathrm{L}} \\ = \theta_{1 \mathrm{L}} \left(1 - \theta_{2 \mathrm{L}}\right) - \left(1 - \theta_{1 \mathrm{L}}\right) \theta_{2 \mathrm{L}} \tag {1.11} \\ = \theta_{1 \mathrm{L}} - \theta_{2 \mathrm{L}} = \theta_{2 \mathrm{K}} - \theta_{1 \mathrm{K}} \\ \end{array}
$$

where we have repeatedly made use of the fact that $\theta_{\mathrm{iL}} + \theta_{\mathrm{iK}} = 1$

In order to fix ideas, let us assume henceforth that industry 1 is labor intensive. This implies that the cost share in industry 1 exceeds that in industry $2, \theta_{\mathrm{1L}} - \theta_{\mathrm{2L}} > 0$, so that $|\theta| > 0$ in (1.11). Furthermore, suppose that the relative price of good 1 increases, so that

$\hat{\mathfrak{p}} = \hat{\mathfrak{p}}_1 - \hat{\mathfrak{p}}_2 > 0$. Then we can solve for the change in factor prices from (1.10) and (1.11) as:

$$
\hat {\mathrm{w}} = \frac{\theta_{2 \mathrm{K}} \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{1} - \theta_{1 \mathrm{K}} \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{2}}{| \theta |} = \frac{\left(\theta_{2 \mathrm{K}} - \theta_{1 \mathrm{K}}\right) \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{1} + \theta_{1 \mathrm{K}} \left(\hat {\mathrm{p}}_{1} - \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{2}\right)}{\left(\theta_{2 \mathrm{K}} - \theta_{1 \mathrm{K}}\right)} > \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{1}, \text{si nc e} \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{1} - \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{2} > 0, \tag {1.12a}
$$

$$
\text{an d ,} \quad \hat {\mathrm{r}} = \frac{\theta_{1 \mathrm{L}} \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{2} - \theta_{2 \mathrm{L}} \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{1}}{| \theta |} = \frac{(\theta_{1 \mathrm{L}} - \theta_{2 \mathrm{L}}) \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{2} - \theta_{2 \mathrm{L}} (\hat {\mathrm{p}}_{1} - \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{2})}{(\theta_{1 \mathrm{L}} - \theta_{2 \mathrm{L}})} <   \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{2}, \quad \text{si nc e} \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{1} - \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{2} > 0. \tag {1.12b}
$$

From the result in (1.12a), we see that the wage increases by more than the price of good 1, $\hat{\mathbf{w}} >\hat{\mathbf{p}}_1 > \hat{\mathbf{p}}_2$. This means that workers can afford to buy more of good 1 ($w/p_1$ has gone up), as well as more of good 2 ($w/p_2$ has gone up). When labor can buy more of both goods in this fashion, we say that the real wage has increased. Looking at the rental on capital in (1.12b), we see that the rental r changes by less than the price of good 2. It follows that capital-owner can afford less of good 2 ($r/p_2$ has gone down), and also less of good 1 ($r/p_1$ has gone down). Thus the real return to capital has fallen. We can summarize these results with the following:

# Stolper-Samuelson (1941) Theorem

An increase in the relative price of a good will increase the real return to the factor used intensively in that good, and reduce the real return to the other factor.

To develop the intuition for this result, let us go back to the differentiated zero-profit conditions in (1.9'). Since the cost shares add up to unity in each industry, we see from equation (1.9') that $\hat{\mathbf{p}}_{\mathrm{i}}$ is a weighted average of the factor price changes $\hat{\mathbf{w}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. This implies that $\hat{\mathbf{p}}_{\mathrm{i}}$ necessarily lies in between $\hat{\mathbf{w}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. Putting these together with our assumption that $\hat{\mathbf{p}}_1 - \hat{\mathbf{p}}_2 > 0$, it is therefore clear that:

$$
\hat {\mathrm{w}} > \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{1} > \hat {\mathrm{p}}_{2} > \hat {\mathrm{r}}. \tag {1.13}
$$

Jones (1965) has called this set of inequalities the "magnification effect": they show that any change in the product price has a magnified effect on the factor prices. This is an extremely important result. Whether we think of the product price change is due to export opportunities for a country (the export price goes up), or due to lowering import tariffs (so the import price goes

down), the magnification effect says that there will be both gainers and losers due to this change. Even though we will argue in chapter 6 that there are gains from trade in some overall sense, it is still the case that trade opportunities have strong distributional consequences, making some people worse off and some better off!

We conclude this section by illustrating the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem in Figure 1.10. We begin with an initial factor price equilibrium given by point A, where industry 1 is labor-intensive. An increase in the price of that industry will shift out the iso-cost curve, and as illustrated, move the equilibrium to point B. It is clear that the wage has gone up, from $\mathrm{w}_0$ to $\mathrm{w}_1$, and the rental has declined, from $\mathrm{r}_0$ to $\mathrm{r}_1$. Can we be sure that the wage has increased in percentage terms by more than the relative price of good 1? The answer is yes, as can be seen by drawing a ray from the origin through the point A. Because the unit-cost functions are homogeneous of degree one in factor prices, moving along this ray increases p and (w,r) in the same proportion. Thus, at the point $\mathrm{A}^*$, the increase in the wage exactly matched the percentage change in the price p. But it is clear that the equilibrium wage increases by more, $\mathrm{w}_1 > \mathrm{w}^*$, so the percentage increase in the wage exceeds that of the product price, which is the Stolper-Samuelson result.

# Changes in Endowments

We turn now to the third key question: if endowments change, how do the industry outputs change? To answer this, we hold the product prices fixed and totally differentiate the full-employment conditions (1.8) to obtain:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/e92518f5-4cf8-4c58-a165-b17ce17987b7/e8ba1fc34f967db3ef30baed1cc29080926f232cfb14bfbcd09d1fae4ceadfcb.jpg)
Figure 1.10

$$
\mathrm{a}_{1 \mathrm{L}} \mathrm{dy}_{1} + \mathrm{a}_{2 \mathrm{L}} \mathrm{dy}_{2} = \mathrm{dL}, \tag {1.14}
$$

$$
\mathrm{a_{1K} d y_{1} + a_{2 K} d y_{2} = d K .}
$$

Notice that the $a_{ij}$ coefficients do not change, despite the fact that they are functions of the factor prices (w, r). These coefficients are fixed because $p$ does not change, so from our earlier Lemma, the factor prices are also fixed.

By re-writing the equations in (1.14) using the "Jone's algebra", we obtain:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{y}_{1} \mathrm{a}_{1 \mathrm{L}}}{\mathrm{L}} \frac{\mathrm{dy}_{1}}{\mathrm{y}_{1}} + \frac{\mathrm{y}_{2} \mathrm{a}_{2 \mathrm{L}}}{\mathrm{L}} \frac{\mathrm{dy}_{2}}{\mathrm{y}_{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{dL}}{\mathrm{L}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda_{1 \mathrm{L}} \hat {\mathrm{y}}_{1} + \lambda_{2 \mathrm{L}} \hat {\mathrm{y}}_{2} = \hat {\mathrm{L}} \tag {1.14'}
$$

$$
\frac{\mathrm{y}_{1} \mathrm{a}_{1 \mathrm{K}}}{\mathrm{K}} \frac{\mathrm{dy}_{1}}{\mathrm{y}_{1}} + \frac{\mathrm{y}_{2} \mathrm{a}_{2 \mathrm{K}}}{\mathrm{K}} \frac{\mathrm{dy}_{2}}{\mathrm{y}_{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{dK}}{\mathrm{K}} \quad \lambda_{1 \mathrm{K}} \hat {\mathrm{y}}_{1} + \lambda_{2 \mathrm{K}} \hat {\mathrm{y}}_{2} = \hat {\mathrm{K}}
$$

To move from the first set of equations to the second, we denote the percentage changes

$\mathrm{dy}_1 / \mathrm{y}_1 = \hat{\mathrm{y}}_1$, and likewise for all the other variables. In addition, we define $\lambda_{\mathrm{iL}}\equiv (\mathrm{y_ia_{iL} / L})$

$= (\mathrm{L_i} / \mathrm{L})$, which measures the fraction of the labor force employed in industry $i$, where

$\lambda_{1\mathrm{L}} + \lambda_{2\mathrm{L}} = 1$. We define $\lambda_{\mathrm{iK}}$ analogously as the fraction of the capital stock employed in industry i.

This system of equations is written in matrix form and solved as:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{l l} \lambda_{1 \mathrm{L}} & \lambda_{2 \mathrm{L}} \\ \lambda_{1 \mathrm{K}} & \lambda_{2 \mathrm{K}} \end{array} \right] \binom {\hat {\mathbf {y}}_{1}} {\hat {\mathbf {y}}_{2}} = \binom {\hat {\mathbf {L}}} {\hat {\mathbf {K}}} \Rightarrow \binom {\hat {\mathbf {y}}_{1}} {\hat {\mathbf {y}}_{2}} = \frac{1}{| \lambda |} \left[ \begin{array}{c c} \lambda_{2 \mathrm{K}} & - \lambda_{2 \mathrm{L}} \\ - \lambda_{1 \mathrm{K}} & \lambda_{1 \mathrm{L}} \end{array} \right] \binom {\hat {\mathbf {L}}} {\hat {\mathbf {K}}}, \tag {1.15}
$$

where  $|\lambda|$  denotes the determinant of the 2x2 matrix on the left, which is simplified as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left| \lambda \right| = \lambda_{1 \mathrm{L}} \lambda_{2 \mathrm{K}} - \lambda_{2 \mathrm{L}} \lambda_{1 \mathrm{K}} \\ = \lambda_{\mathrm{1L}} (1 - \lambda_{\mathrm{1K}}) - (1 - \lambda_{\mathrm{1L}}) \lambda_{\mathrm{1K}} \tag {1.16} \\ = \lambda_{\mathrm{1L}} - \lambda_{\mathrm{1K}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{2K}} - \lambda_{\mathrm{2L}} \\ \end{array}
$$

where we have repeatedly made use of the fact that  $\lambda_{1\mathrm{L}} + \lambda_{2\mathrm{L}} = 1$  and  $\lambda_{1\mathrm{K}} + \lambda_{2\mathrm{K}} = 1$ .

Recall that we assumed industry 1 to be labor-intensive. This implies that the share of the labor force employed in industry 1 exceeds the share of the capital stock used there, $\lambda_{\mathrm{1L}} - \lambda_{\mathrm{1K}} > 0$, so that $|\lambda| > 0$ in (1.16). Suppose further that the endowments of labor is increasing, while the endowments of capital remains fixed such that $\hat{\mathbf{L}} > 0$, and $\hat{\mathbf{K}} = 0$. Then we can solve for the change in outputs from (1.15)-(1.16) as,

$$
\hat {y}_{1} = \frac{\lambda_{2 K}}{(\lambda_{2 K} - \lambda_{2 L})} \hat {L} > \hat {L} > 0 \quad \text{an d} \quad \hat {y}_{2} = \frac{\lambda_{1 K}}{| \lambda |} <   0. \tag {1.17}
$$

From (1.17), we see that the output of the labor-intensive industry 1 expands, whereas the output of industry 2 contracts. We have therefore established:

# Rybczynski (1955) Theorem:

An increase in a factor endowment will increase output of the industry using it intensively, and decrease the output of the other industry.

The intitution for this result is developed in Figure 1.11. With the initial endowments $(\mathrm{L},\mathrm{K})$, the equilibrium outputs are $\mathbf{y}_1$ and $\mathbf{y}_2$. Now suppose that the labor endowment increases to $\mathrm{L}' > \mathrm{L}$, with no change in the capital endowment. Starting from the endowments $(\mathrm{L}',\mathrm{K})$, the only way to add up multiples of $(\mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{K}})$ and $(\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{L}},\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{K}})$ and obtain the endowments is to

reduce the output of industry 2 to  $y_2'$ , and increase the output of industry 1 to  $y_1'$ . This means that not only does industry 1 absorb the entire amount of the extra labor endowment, it also absorbs further labor and capital from industry 2 so that its ultimate labor/capital ratio is unchanged from before. The labor/capital ratio in industry 2 is also unchanged, and this is what permits both industries to pay exactly the same factor prices as they did before the change in endowments.

There are many examples of the Rybczynski Theorem in practice, but perhaps the most commonly cited is what is called the "Dutch Disease." This refers to the discovery of oil off the coast of the Netherlands, which led to an increase in industries making use of this resource. (Shell Oil, one of the world's largest producers of petroleum products, is a Dutch company.) At the same time, however, other "traditional" export industries of the Netherlands contracted. This occurred because resources were attracted away from these industries and into those that were intensive in oil, as the Rybczynski Theorem would predict.

Our final task for this chapter is to trace through the changes in the outputs, induced by changes in endowments, on the equilibrium of the production possibilities frontier. As the labor endowment grows in Figure 1.11, the PPF will shift out. This is shown in Figure 1.12, where the outputs will shift from point A to point $\mathrm{A}'$ with an increased of good 1 and reduction of good 2, at the unchanged price p. As the endowment of labor rises, we can join up all points such as A and $\mathrm{A}'$, where the slopes of the PPFs are equal. These form a downward sloping line, which we will call the Rybczynski line for changes in labor ($\Delta L$). The Rybczynski line for $\Delta L$ indicates how outputs change as labor endowment expands.

Of course, there is also a Rybczynski line for $\Delta \mathbf{K}$, which indicates how the outputs change as the capital endowment grows: this would lead to an increase in the output of good 2, and reduction in the output of good 1. As drawn, we have illustrated both of the Rybczynski lines as straight lines: can we be sure that this is the case? The answer is yes: the fact that the product price is fixed along a Rybczynski line, implying that factor prices are also fixed, ensures that these are straight lines. To see this, we can easily calculated their slopes by differentiating the full-employment conditions (1.8). To compute the slope of the Rybczynski line for $\Delta L$, it is convenient to work with the full-employment condition for capital, since that endowment does not change. Total differentiating (1.8) for capital gives:

$$
\mathrm{a}_{1 \mathrm{K}} \mathrm{y}_{1} + \mathrm{a}_{2 \mathrm{K}} \mathrm{y}_{2} = \mathrm{K} \Rightarrow \mathrm{a}_{1 \mathrm{K}} \mathrm{dy}_{1} + \mathrm{a}_{2 \mathrm{K}} \mathrm{dy}_{2} = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{dy}_{2}}{\mathrm{dy}_{1}} = - \frac{\mathrm{a}_{1 \mathrm{K}}}{\mathrm{a}_{2 \mathrm{K}}}. \tag {1.18}
$$

Thus, the slope of the Rybczynski line for  $\Delta L$  is the negative of the ratio of capital/output in the two industries, which is constant for fixed prices. This proves that the Rybczynski lines are indeed straight.

If we continue to increase the labor endowment in Figure 1.12, outputs will move downwards on the Rybczynski line for $\Delta L$, until this line hits the $y_{1}$ axis. At this point the economy is fully specialized in good 1. In terms of Figure 1.7, the vector of endowments (L, K) is coincident with the vector of factor requirements ($a_{1L}, a_{1K}$) in industry 1. For further increases in the labor endowment, the Rybczynski line for $\Delta L$ then moves right along the $y_{1}$ axis in Figure 1.12, indicating that the economy remains specialized in good 1.$^{14}$ This corresponds to the vector of endowments (L, K) lying outside and below the cone of diversification in Figure 1.7.

With the economy fully specialized in good 1, factor prices are determined by the marginal products of labor and capital in that good, and the earlier "factor price insensitivity" Lemma no longer applies.

# Conclusions

In this chapter we have reviewed several two-sector models: the Ricardian model, with just one factor, and the two-by-two model, with two factors both of which are fully mobile between industries. There are other two-sector models, of course: if we add a third factor, treating capital as specific to each sector but labor as mobile, then we obtain the Ricardo-Viner or "sector-specific" model, as will be discussed in chapter 3. We will have an opportunity to make use of the two-by-two model throughout this book, and a thorough understanding of its properties, as presented in this chapter, is essential for all the material that follows.

This is the only chapter where we do not present any accompanying empirical evidence. The reader should not infer from this that the two-by-two model is unrealistic: while it is usually necessary to add more goods or factors to this model before confronting it with data, the relationships between prices, outputs and endowments that we have identified in this chapter will carry over in some form to more general settings. Evidence on the pattern of trade is presented in the next chapter, where we extend the two-by-two model by adding another country, and then many countries, trading with each other. We also allow for many goods and factors, but for the most part restrict attention to situations where factor price equalization holds. In chapter 3, we examine the case of many goods and factors in greater detail, to determine whether the Stolper-Samuelson and Rybczynski Theorems generalize and also how to estimate these effects. In chapter 4, evidence on the relationship between product prices and wages is examined in detail, using a model that allows for trade in intermediate inputs. The reader is already well prepared

for these chapters that follow, based on the tools and intuition we have developed from the two-by-two model. Before moving on, you are encouraged to complete the problems at the end of this chapter.

# Problems

1.1 Rewrite the production function $\mathrm{y}_1 = \mathrm{f}_1(\mathrm{L}_1, \mathrm{K}_1)$ as $\mathrm{y}_1 = \mathrm{f}_1(\mathrm{v}_1)$, and similarly, $\mathrm{y}_2 = \mathrm{f}_2(\mathrm{v}_2)$.

Concavity means that given two points $\mathbf{y}_1^{\mathrm{a}} = \mathbf{f}_1(\mathbf{v}_1^{\mathrm{a}})$ and $\mathbf{y}_1^{\mathrm{b}} = \mathbf{f}_1(\mathbf{v}_1^{\mathrm{b}})$, and $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$, then

$\mathrm{f}_1(\lambda \mathrm{v}_1^{\mathrm{a}} + (1 - \lambda)\mathrm{v}_1^{\mathrm{b}}) \geq \lambda \mathrm{y}_1^{\mathrm{a}} + (1 - \lambda)\mathrm{y}_1^{\mathrm{b}}$. Similarly for the production function $\mathrm{y}_2 = \mathrm{f}_2(\mathrm{v}_2)$.

Consider two points $y^a = (y_1^a, y_2^a)$ and $y^b = (y_1^b, y_2^b)$, both of which can be produced while satisfying the full-employment conditions $v_1^a + v_2^a \leq V$ and $v_1^b + v_2^b \leq V$, where $V$ are the endowments. Consider a production point mid-way between these, $\lambda y^a + (1 - \lambda) y^b$. Then use the concavity of the production functions to show that this point can also be produced while satisfying the full-employment conditions. This proves that the production possibilities set is convex. (Hint: Rather than showing that $\lambda y^a + (1 - \lambda) y^b$ can be produced while satisfying the full-employment conditions, consider instead allocating $\lambda v_1^a + (1 - \lambda) v_1^b$ of the resources to industry 1, and $\lambda v_2^a + (1 - \lambda) v_2^b$ of the resources to industry 2.)

1.2 Any function $\mathrm{y} = \mathrm{f}(\mathrm{v})$ is homogeneous of degree $\alpha$ if for all $\lambda > 0$, $\mathrm{f}(\lambda \mathrm{v}) = \lambda^{\alpha} \mathrm{f}(\mathrm{v})$.

Differentiating with respect to $\alpha$ and evaluating at $\alpha = 1$, we therefore obtain: $f_{v}(v)'v = \alpha f(v)$.

Consider the production function $y = f(L, K)$, which we assume is homogeneous of degree one, so that $f(\lambda L, \lambda K) = \lambda f(L, K)$. Now differentiate this expression with respect to $L$, and answer:

Is the marginal product $\mathrm{f_L(L,K)}$ homogeneous, and of what degree? Use the expression you have obtained to show that $\mathrm{f_L(L /K,1)} = \mathrm{f_L(L,K)}$.

1.3 Consider the problem of maximizing $y_{1} = f_{1}(L_{1},K_{1})$, subject to the full-employment conditions $\mathrm{L}_1 + \mathrm{L}_2 \leq \mathrm{L}$ and $\mathrm{K}_1 + \mathrm{K}_2 \leq \mathrm{K}$, and the constraint $\mathrm{y}_2 = \mathrm{f}_2(\mathrm{L}_2, \mathrm{K}_2)$. Set this up as a Lagrangian, and obtain the first-order conditions. Then use the Lagrangian to solve for $\mathrm{dy}_1 / \mathrm{dy}_2$ which is the slope of the production possibilities frontier. How is this slope related to the marginal product of labor and capital?

1.4 Consider the problem of maximizing $p_1 f_1(L_1, K_1) + p_2 f_2(L_2, K_2)$, subject to the full employment constraints $\mathrm{L}_1 + \mathrm{L}_2\leq \mathrm{L}$ and $\mathrm{K}_1 + \mathrm{K}_2\leq \mathrm{K}$. Call the result the GDP function $\mathrm{G}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{L},\mathrm{K})$ where $\mathbf{p} = (\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2)$ is the price vector. Then answer:

(a) What is $\partial G / \partial p_{i}$? (Hint: we solved for this in the chapter)
(b) Give an economic interpretation to $\partial G / \partial L$ and $\partial G / \partial K$.
(c) Give an economic interpretation to $\partial^2\mathrm{G} / \partial \mathrm{p_i}\partial \mathrm{L} = \partial^2\mathrm{G} / \partial \mathrm{L}\partial \mathrm{p_i}$, and $\partial^2\mathrm{G} / \partial \mathrm{p_i}\partial \mathrm{K} = \partial^2\mathrm{G} / \partial \mathrm{K}\partial \mathrm{p_i}$.

1.5 Trace through changes in outputs when there are factor intensity reversals. That is,

construct a graph with the capital endowment on the horizontal axis, and the output of good 1 on

the vertical axis. Starting at a point of diversification (where both goods are produced) in cone A

of Figure 1.8, draw the changes in output of good 1 as the capital endowment grows outside of

cone A, into cone B, and beyond this.
