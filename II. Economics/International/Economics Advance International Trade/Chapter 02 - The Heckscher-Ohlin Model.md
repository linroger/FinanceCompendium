# Chapter 2: The Heckscher-Ohlin Model

We begin this chapter by describing the Heckscher-Ohlin model with two countries, two goods, and two factors (or the  $2 \times 2 \times 2$  model). This formulation is often called the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS) model, based on the work of Paul Samuelson who developed a mathematical model from the original insights of Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin. The goal of that model is to predict the pattern of trade in goods between the two countries, based on their differences in factor endowments. Following this, we present the multi-good, multi-factor extension that is associated with the work of Vanek (1968), and is often called the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model. As we shall see, in this latter formulation we do not attempt to keep track of the trade pattern in individual goods, but instead, compute the "factor content" of trade, i.e. the amounts of labor, capital, land, etc. embodied in the exports and imports of a country.

The factor-content formulation of the HOV model has led to a great deal of empirical research, beginning with Leontief (1953) and continuing with Leamer (1980), Bowen, Leamer and Sveikaukas (1987), Trefler (1993, 1995), Davis and Weinstein (2001a), with many other writers in-between. We will explain the twists and turns in this chain of empirical research. The bottom line is that the HOV model performs quite poorly empirically unless we are willing to dispense with the assumption of identical technologies across countries. This brings us back to the earlier tradition of the Ricardian model of allowing for technological differences, which also implies differences in factor prices across countries. We will show several ways that technological differences can be incorporated into an "extended" HO model, and their empirical results, and this remains a question of ongoing research.

## Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS) Model

The basic assumptions of the HOS model were already introduced in the previous chapter: identical technologies across countries; identical and homothetic tastes across countries; differing factor endowments; and free trade in goods (but not factors). For the most part, we will also assume away the possibility of factor-intensity reversals. Provided that all countries have their endowments within their "cone of diversification," this means that factor prices are equalized across countries

We begin by supposing that there are just two countries, two sectors and two factors, exactly like the two-by-two model we introduced in chapter 1. We shall assume that the home country is labor abundant, so that  $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{K} > \mathrm{L}^{*} / \mathrm{K}^{*}$ . We will also assume that good 1 is labor intensive. The countries engage in free trade, and we also suppose that trade is balanced (value of exports = value of imports). Then the question is: what is the pattern of trade in goods between the countries? This is answered by:

### Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem

Each country will export the good that uses its abundant factor intensively.

Thus, under our assumptions the home country will export good 1 and the foreign country will export good 2. To prove this, let us take a particular case of the factor endowment differences  $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{K} > \mathrm{L}^{*} / \mathrm{K}^{*}$ , and assume that the labor endowments are identical in the two countries,  $\mathrm{L}^{*} = \mathrm{L}$ , while the foreign capital endowments exceeds that at home,  $\mathrm{K}^{*} > \mathrm{K}$ . In order to derive the pattern of trade between the countries, we proceed by first establishing what the relative product price is in each country without any trade, or in autarky. As we shall see, the pattern of autarky prices can then be used to predict the pattern of trade: a country will export the good whose free trade price is higher than its autarky price, and import the other.

Let us begin by illustrating the home autarky equilibrium, at point A in Figure 2.1. We have assumed a representative consumer with homothetic tastes, so we can use indifference curves to reflect demand. The autarky equilibrium is established where an indifference curve is tangent to the home PPF, at point A. The price line drawn tangent to the PPF and indifference curve has a slope of (negative) the autarky relative price of good 1,  $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{a}} \equiv \mathrm{p}_{1}^{\mathrm{a}} / \mathrm{p}_{2}^{\mathrm{a}}$ . Let us now consider the foreign PPF, which is drawn outside the home PPF in the Figure 2.1. In order to determine where the foreign autarky equilibrium lies, let us initially suppose that  $p^{\mathrm{a}}$  is also the autarky equilibrium abroad, and see whether this assumption leads to a contradiction.

If  $p^a$  is also the autarky price in the foreign country, then production must occur at the tangency between the price line with slope  $p^a$  and the foreign PPF, or at point  $B'$ . Notice that from the Rybcynzski Theorem, point  $B'$  must lie above and to the left of point A: the higher capital endowment abroad leads to more of good 2 and less of good 1. The price line through point  $B'$  acts like a budget constraint for the representative consumer in the foreign country, so that the consumer chooses the highest indifference curve on this price line. Since tastes are homothetic, the foreign representative consumer will demand the two goods in exactly the same proportion as the home representative consumer. In other words, the foreign consumption point must lie on the budget constraint through point  $B'$ , and also on a ray from the origin through

point A. Thus, foreign consumption must occur at point  $C'$ , which is above and to the right of point A. Since points  $B'$  and  $C'$  do not coincide, we have arrived at a contradiction: the relative price  $p^a$  at home cannot equal the autarky price abroad, and on the contrary, at this price there is an excess demand for good 1 in the foreign country. This excess demand will bid up the relative price of good 1, so that the foreign autarky price must be higher than at home,  $p^{a^*} > p^a$ .

To establish the free trade equilibrium price, let  $z(p)$  denote the excess demand for good 1 at any prevailing price  $p$  at home, while  $z^{*}(p^{*})$  denotes the excess demand for good 1 abroad. World excess demand at a common price is therefore  $z(p) + z^{*}(p^{*})$ , and a free trade equilibrium occurs when world excess demand is equal to zero. The home autarky equilibrium satisfies  $z(p^a) = 0$ , and we have shown above that  $z^{*}(p^{a}) > 0$ . It follows that  $z(p^{a}) + z^{*}(p^{a}) > 0$ . If instead we reversed the argument in Figure 2.1, and started with the foreign autarky price satisfying  $z^{*}(p^{a^{*}}) = 0$ , then we could readily prove that  $z(p^{a^{*}}) < 0$ , so at the foreign autarky price there is excess supply of good 1 at home. It follows that world excess demand would satisfy  $z(p^{a^{*}}) + z^{*}(p^{a^{*}}) < 0$ . Then by continuity of the excess demand functions, there must be a price  $p$ , with  $p^{a^{*}} > p > p^{a}$ , such that  $z(p) + z^{*}(p) = 0$ . This is the equilibrium price with free trade.

Let us illustrate the free trade equilibrium, in Figure 2.2. In panel (a) we show the equilibrium at home, and in panel (b) we show the equilibrium in the foreign country. Beginning at the home autarky point A, the relative price of good 1 rises at home,  $p > p^{\mathrm{a}}$ . It follows that production will occur at a point like B, where the price line through point B has the slope p. Once again, this price line acts as a budget constraint for the representative consumer, and utility is maximized at point C. The difference between production at point B and consumption at point

C is made up through exporting good 1 and importing good 2, as illustrated by the “trade triangle” drawn. This trade pattern at home establishes the HO Theorem stated above. In the foreign country, the reverse pattern occurs: the relative price of good 1 falls,  $p^{a^*} > p$ , production moves from the autarky equilibrium point A* to production at point B* and consumption at point C*, where good 1 is imported and good 2 is exported. Notice that the trade triangles drawn at home and abroad are identical in size: the exports of one country must be imports of the other.

In addition to establishing the trade pattern, the HO model has precise implications about who gains and who loses from trade: the abundant factor in each country gains from trade, and the scarce factor loses. This result follows from the pattern of price changes  $(\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{a}^{*}} > \mathrm{p} > \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{a}})$  and the Stolper-Samuelson theorem. With the relative price of good 1 rising at home, the factor used intensively in that good (labor) will gain in real terms, and the other factor (capital) will lose. Notice that labor is the abundant factor at home. The fact that  $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{K} > \mathrm{L}^{*} / \mathrm{K}^{*}$  means that labor would have been earning less in the home autarky equilibrium than in the foreign autarky equilibrium: its marginal product at home would have been lower (in both goods) than abroad. However, with free trade the home country can shift production towards the labor-intensive good, and export it, thereby absorbing the abundant factor without lowering its wage. Indeed, factor prices are equalized in the two countries after trade, as we argued in the previous chapter. Thus, the abundant factor, whose factor price was bid down in autarky, will gain from the opening of trade, while the scarce factor in each country loses.

Our presentation of the HO model above is about as far as most discussion of this model goes at the undergraduate level. After showing something like Figure 2.2, it would be common to provide some rough data or anecdotes to illustrate the HO Theorem (e.g. the United States in abundant in scientists, so it exports high-tech goods; Canada is abundant in land, so it exports natural resources, etc.). As plausible as these illustrations are, it turns out that the HO model is a rather poor predictor of actual trade patterns, indicating that its assumptions are not realistic. It has taken many years, however, to understand why this is the case, and we begin this exploration by considering the earliest results of Leontief (1953).

## Leontief's Paradox

Leontief (1953) was the first to confront the HO model with data. He had developed the set of input-output accounts for the U.S. economy, which allowed him to compute the amounts of labor and capital used in each industry for 1947. In addition, he utilized U.S. trade data for the same year to compute the amounts of labor and capital used in the production of \$1 million of U.S. exports and imports. His results are shown in Table 2.1.

Table 2.1: Leontief's (1953) Test

<table><tr><td></td><td>Exports</td><td>Imports</td></tr><tr><td>Capital ($ million)</td><td>$2.5</td><td>$3.1</td></tr><tr><td>Labor (person-years)</td><td>182</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>Capital/Labor ($/person)</td><td>$13,700</td><td>\$18,200</td></tr></table>

Note: Each column shows the amount of capital or labor needed per \$1 million worth of exports or imports into the United States, for 1947.

Leontief first measured the amount of capital and labor required for  \$1 million worth of U.S. exports. This calculation requires that we measure the labor and capital used directly, i.e. in each exporting industry, and also these factors used indirectly, i.e. in the industries that produce intermediate inputs that are used in producing exports. From the first row of Table 2.1, we see that\$ 2.5 million worth of capital was used in \$1 million of exports. This amount of capital seems much too high, until we recognize that what is being measured is the capital stock, so that only the annual depreciation on this stock is actually used. For labor, 182 person-years was used to produce the exports. Taking the ratio of these, we find that each person employed in producing exports (directly or indirectly) is working with \$13,700 worth of capital.

Turning to the import side of the calculation, we immediately run into a problem: it is not possible to measure the amount of labor and capital used in producing imports unless we have knowledge of the foreign technologies, which Leontief certainly did not know in 1953! Indeed, it is only very recently that researchers have begun to use data on foreign technologies to test the HO model, as we will describe later in the chapter. So Leontief did what many researchers have done since: he simply used the U.S. technology to calculate the amount of labor and capital used in imports. Does this invalidate the test of the HO model? Not really, because recall that an assumption of the HO model is that technologies are the same across countries. Thus, under the null hypothesis that the HO model is true, it would be valid to use the U.S. technology to measure the labor and capital used in imports. If we find that this null hypothesis is rejected, then one explanation would be that the assumption of identical technologies is false.

Using the U.S. technology to measure the labor and capital used in imports, both directly and indirectly, we arrive at the estimates in the last column of Table 2.1:  \$3.1 million of capital, 170 person-years, and so a capital/labor ratio in imports of\$ 18,200. Remarkably, this is higher

than the capital/labor ratio found for U.S. exports! Under the presumption that the U.S. was capital-abundant in 1956, this appears to contradict the HO Theorem. Thus, this finding came to be called “Leontief’s Paradox.”

A wide range of explanations have been offered for this paradox:

U.S. and foreign technologies are not the same;
- By focusing only on labor and capital, Leontief ignored land;
- Labor should have been disaggregated by skill (since it would not be surprising to find that U.S. exports are intensive in skilled labor);
- The data for 1947 may by unusual, since World War II had just ended;
- The U.S. was not engaged in free trade, as the HO model assumes.

These reasons are all quite valid criticisms of the test that Leontief performed, and research in the years following his test aimed to re-do the analysis while taking into account land, skilled versus unskilled labor, checking other years, etc. This research is well summarized by Deardorff (1984a), and the general conclusion is that the paradox continued to occur in some cases. It was not until two decades later, however, that Leamer (1980) provided the definitive critique of the Leontief paradox: it turned out that Leontief had performed the wrong test! That is, even if the HO model is true, it turns out the capital/labor ratios in export and imports, as reported in Table 2.1, should not be compared. Instead, an alternative test should be performed. The test that Leamer proposed relies on the "factor content" version of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, developed by Vanek (1968), which we turn to next.

## Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) Model

Let us now consider many countries, indexed by  $\mathrm{i} = 1,\ldots ,\mathrm{C}$ ; many industries, indexed by  $\mathrm{j} = 1,\ldots ,\mathrm{N}$ ; and many factors, indexed by  $\mathbf{k},\ell = 1,\ldots ,\mathbf{M}$ . We will continue to assume that technologies are identical across countries, and that factor-price equalization prevails under free trade. In addition, we assume that tastes are identical and homothetic across countries.

Let the (MxN) matrix  $\mathbf{A} = [\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{jk}}]^\prime$  denote the amounts of labor, capital, land, and other primary factors needed for one unit of production in each industry. Notice that this matrix applies in any country. The rows measure the different factors  $\mathbf{k}$ ,  $\ell = 1,\dots ,\mathbf{M}$ , while the columns of this matrix measure the different industries  $j = 1,\ldots ,N$ . For example, with just two industries using only labor and capital, this matrix would be  $\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{L}} & \mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{L}} \\ \mathbf{a}_{1\mathrm{K}} & \mathbf{a}_{2\mathrm{K}} \end{bmatrix}$ .

Next, let  $\mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{i}}$  denote the (Nx1) vector of outputs in each industry for country i, and let  $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{i}}$  denote the (Nx1) vector of demands of each good, so that  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{i}}$  equals the vector of net exports for country i. The factor content of trade is then defined as  $\mathbf{F}^{\mathrm{i}} \equiv \mathbf{A}\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , which is an (Mx1) vector. We will denote individual components of this vector as  $\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , where a positive value indicates that the factor is exported, while a negative value indicates that the factor is imported. For example, with just labor and capital, the factor content of trade is  $\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{F}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{i}} \\ \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}} \end{pmatrix} \equiv \mathbf{A}\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{i}}$ .

The goal of the HOV model is to relate the factor content of trade  $\mathrm{AT}^{\mathrm{i}}$  to the underlying endowments of country i. To do so, we can proceed by computing  $\mathrm{AY}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . The term  $\mathrm{AY}^{\mathrm{i}}$  equals the demand for factors in country i. Analogous to the full-employment conditions studied in chapter 1,  $\mathrm{AY}^{\mathrm{i}}$  equals the endowments of country i, which we write as  $\mathrm{AY}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . Turning to  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , this terms is simplified by using our assumption of identical and homothetic tastes. Since product prices are equalized across countries by free trade, it follows that the consumption vectors of all countries must be proportional to each other. We shall write this as  $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{w}}$ , where  $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{w}}$  denotes the world consumption vector and  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}$  is the share of country i in world consumption. It follows that  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{w}}$ . Note that if trade is balanced, then  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}$  also equals country i's share of world GDP. $^5$  Since world consumption must equal world production, we therefore obtain  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{w}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{AY}^{\mathrm{w}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{w}}$ , where the last equality is the full-employment condition at the world level.

Making use of these expressions for  $\mathrm{AY}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , we have therefore proved:

$$
F^{i} \equiv A T^{i} = V^{i} - s^{i} V^{w}, \tag {2.1}
$$

which is a statement of the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) Theorem. In terms of individual factors, this is written as  $\mathrm{F_k^i =V_k^i -s^iV_k^w}$ . If country i's endowment of factor k relative to the world endowment exceeds country i's share of world GDP ( $\mathrm{V_k^i /V_k^w >s^i}$ ), then we say that country i is abundant in that factor. In that case, (2.1) says that the factor-content of trade in factor k should also be positive ( $\mathrm{F_k^i >0}$ ), and conversely if country i is scarce in factor k

$$
(\mathrm{V_{k}^{i}} / \mathrm{V_{k}^{w}} < s^{i}).
$$

What does the HOV Theorem tell us about the Leontief test? To answer this, let us focus on just two elements of the factor-content vector, for labor and capital. These are written as:

$$
F_{k}^{i} = K^{i} - s^{i} K^{w}, \tag {2.2a}
$$

$$
F_{\ell}^{i} = L^{i} - s^{i} L^{w}, \tag {2.2b}
$$

where  $\mathrm{F_k^i}$  and  $\mathrm{F}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{i}}$  are the computed factor contents of trade, and  $\mathbf{K}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathbf{L}^{\mathrm{i}}$  are the capital and labor endowments for country i. Following Leamer (1980), we define capital to be abundant relative to labor in country i if  $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{w}} > \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{w}}$ . Then using (2.2), the implications of capital abundance are:

### Theorem (Leamer, 1980)

If capital is abundant relative to labor in country  $i$ , then the HOV Theorem (2.1) implies that the capital/labor ratio embodied in production for country  $i$  exceeds the capital/labor ratio embodied in consumption:

$$
\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} > \left(\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}\right) / \left(\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{F}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{i}}\right). \tag {2.3}
$$

Proof:

From equation (2.2), we have  $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{w}} = (\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}) / \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{w}} = (\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{F}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{i}}) / \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . It follows that  $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{w}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} / (\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}})$  and  $\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{w}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} / (\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{F}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{i}})$ . Then  $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{w}} > \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{w}}$  implies that  $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} / (\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}) > \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} / (\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{F}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{i}})$ , which is rewritten as (2.3). QED

To interpret this result, note that  $\mathbf{K}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathbf{L}^{\mathrm{i}}$  are simply the endowments of capital and labor, or alternatively, the capital and labor embodied in production. If we subtract the content of these factors embodied in trade, then what we end up with can be defined as the factor-content of consumption, or  $\mathbf{K}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathbf{L}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathbf{F}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . Then equation (2.3) states that the capital/labor ratio embodied in production (on the left) must exceed the capital/labor ratio embodied in consumption (on the right).

The results from making this comparison for the U.S. in 1947 are shown in Table 2.2. In the first column we list the capital and labor endowments for the U.S., and in the second column we show the capital and labor embodied in consumption. Taking the ratio of these, it is indeed the case that the capital/labor ratio embodied in production exceeds that in consumption. This is the precise application of the HOV Theorem, and it turns out to be satisfied for the U.S. in 1947, contrary to what Leontief concluded. Thus, there was no paradox after all!

It is useful to see the HOV Theorem and Leamer's result in a diagram. In Figure 2.3, the length of the horizontal axis is the world labor endowment  $\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{w}} = \mathrm{L}^{1} + \mathrm{L}^{2}$ , and the length of the vertical axis is the world capital endowment  $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{w}} = \mathrm{K}^{1} + \mathrm{K}^{2}$ . The origin for country 1 is in the lower-left corner, and for country 2 is in the upper-right corner. Thus, any point in the world endowment box measures the endowments  $(\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{i}}, \mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{i}})$  of the two countries. Suppose that the endowments are at the point  $\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , where country 1 is labor-abundant,  $\mathrm{L}^{1} / \mathrm{K}^{1} > \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{w}} / \mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{w}} > \mathrm{L}^{2} / \mathrm{K}^{2}$ .

Under the assumptions of the HOV model, the consumption of each country  $D^i$  is proportional to world consumption  $D^w$ , which means that the factor content of consumption  $AD^i$  is proportional to  $AD^w = V^w$ . In other words, the factor-content of consumption must lie along

Figure 2.3

the diagonal in the world endowment box, as illustrated by point  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . Therefore, a line from point  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$  to point  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$  measures the factor content of trade. In Figure 2.3, country 1 exports  $\mathbf{F}_{\ell}^{1}$  of labor services, and imports  $\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{1}$  of capital services. The slope of the line between  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$  measures the ratio of factor prices.

The theorem of Leamer (1980) states that if country 1 is labor-abundant, as illustrated, then the capital/labor ratio embodied in consumption must exceed the capital/labor ratio embodied in production. That is, since the consumption point  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$  must lie on the diagonal, it is necessary above the endowment point  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . While this is graphically obvious, note that it does not depend in any way on whether trade is balanced or not. For example, if country 1 is running a trade surplus (with the value of production exceeding consumption), then we should move the consumption point  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$  to the left down the diagonal. This would have not effect whatsoever on the capital/labor ratio embodied in consumption as compared to the capital/labor ratio embodied in production. So Leamer's test of the HOV theorem in (2.3) is completely robust to having non-balanced trade. Alternatively, holding consumption fixed at  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , we could vary the factor endowments along the line EE (parallel to the diagonal). By drawing the triangle of factor trade to the diagonal, we see that any endowments along EE have same factor content of trade.

## Partial Tests of the HOV Theorem

The statement of the HOV Theorem in (2.1) tells us immediately how a complete test of the theory should be performed: simply compute the left-hand side (using data on trade  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and technology A), compute the right-hand side (using data on endowments  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{w}}$ ), and compare them. Depending on how well they match up, we can judge whether the Theorem is an empirical success or not. This complete test requires both trade and endowments data for many countries, and technology data for at least one country. While such data is readily available today, this was not the case two or three decades ago. Accordingly, many researchers, including Leontief himself, performed what we can call "partial tests" of the HOV model, using only two rather than all three types of data. Before considering the complete test, we will review several other partial tests that were performed.

Let us assume that the number of goods equals the number of factors, so that A is a square matrix, which we assume is invertible. Then we can re-write (2.1) as:

$$
\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{A}^{- 1} \left(\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{w}}\right). \tag {2.4}
$$

This equation could be tested in several ways. First, if we think about the matrix  $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$  as data, then we could run a regression of  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{i}}$  on  $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ , and coefficients obtained would serve as an estimate of the relative abundance  $(\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathbf{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{W}})$  of each factor. Baldwin (1971) performed a test similar to this, but instead of regressing  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{i}}$  on  $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ , he actually regressed  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{i}}$  on  $\mathbf{A}'$ . With two factors and

three goods, for example, A' is the matrix  $\begin{bmatrix} a_{1\mathrm{L}} & a_{1\mathrm{K}} \\ a_{2\mathrm{L}} & a_{2\mathrm{K}} \\ a_{3\mathrm{L}} & a_{3\mathrm{K}} \end{bmatrix}$ . Thus, Baldwin regressed the adjusted net exports of each industry on their labor and capital requirements needed for one unit of production.

Using data for 60 U.S. industries for years around 1960, and disaggregating workers by their types, Baldwin (1971) obtained the following result:

Adjusted net exports  $= -1.37^{*}$  (Physical Capital/Worker)  $+7011^{*}$  (Scientists/Worker)
- 1473 (Managers/Worker) + 71 (Clerical Staff/Worker)
+ 1578\* (Craftsmen & Foremen/Worker) + 248 (Operatives/Worker)
+ 761 (Unskilled Employee/Worker) +  $845^{*}$  (Farmers/Worker)
+ (Other variables included for industry scale and unionization),

$\mathrm{N} = 60, \mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.44, * = \text{significantat } 95\%$  level

Thus, looking across the U.S. industries, Baldwin finds that those industries using more scientist, craftsmen and foremen, or farmers relative to total workers, will tend to have higher exports. The importance of scientists and farmers in predicting U.S. exports is not surprising at all, since the U.S. is abundant in skilled-labor and land; and the importance of craftsmen and foremen is perhaps reasonable, too. What is surprising, however, is the negative coefficient found on the very first variable, physical capital/worker. Taken literally, this coefficient says that U.S. industries using more capital/worker will tend to export less. This is exactly the

opposite of what we would expect if the U.S. were capital-abundant. Thus, this result appears to be similar to the “paradox” found by Leontief.

Various writers after Baldwin have redone the type of regression shown above, with mixed results: sometimes the capital coefficient is positive, but other times it is again negative (see the survey by Deardorff, 1984a). What are we to make of these results? Well, as we argued for Leontief's original paradox, it can be questioned whether Baldwin's approach is a valid test of the HOV model. From (2.4), a valid test would be to regress  $\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{i}}$  on  $\mathrm{A}^{-1}$ , but instead, Baldwin regressed  $\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{i}}$  on  $\mathrm{A}^{\prime}$ . To see the consequences of this, use the ordinary least squares (OLS) formula for the coefficients  $\beta$  that would be obtained from this regression:

$$
\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{A}^{\prime} \beta \Rightarrow \hat {\beta} = \left(\mathrm{AA}^{\prime}\right)^{- 1} \mathrm{AT}^{\mathrm{i}} = \left(\mathrm{AA}^{\prime}\right)^{- 1} \left(\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{w}}\right), \tag {2.5}
$$

where the final equality follows from using the HOV Theorem (2.1).

Thus, we see that  $\hat{\beta}$  is a contaminated estimate of the vector of relative factor endowments  $(\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{w}})$ . Namely, rather than equaling the relative factor endowments vector,  $\hat{\beta}$  equals the positive definite matrix  $(\mathrm{AA'})^{-1}$  times  $(\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{w}})$ . Because  $(\mathrm{AA'})^{-1}$  is certainly not the identity matrix, it is entirely possible that the sign pattern of the elements in  $\hat{\beta}$  will differ from the sign pattern of  $(\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{w}})$ . In other words, even if the U.S. was capital-abundant and the HOV Theorem held, it would still be possible for the Baldwin regression to find a negative coefficient on capital: this does not contradict the HOV Theorem, because like the original Leontief approach, it is the wrong test.

The careful reader might point out, however, that possible differences in the sign pattern of  $\hat{\beta}$  and  $(\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{w}})$  can presumably be checked for using the actual data on  $(\mathrm{AA'})^{-1}$ . This is exactly the approach taken by Bowen and Sveikaukus (1992), who argue that such sign reversals are very unlikely to occur in practice. Thus, the Baldwin regression may be acceptable in practice, and in fact, it has been used in recent research by Romalis (2001). $^{10}$  As a descriptive tool to show how trade is related to industry factor requirements this regression makes good sense, but as a definitive test of the HOV Theorem it is inadequate for the reasons we have described.

A second "partial test" of the HOV Theorem in equation (2.4) has been used by Leamer (1984). In contrast to Baldwin, Leamer tested (2.4) by treating factor endowments  $(\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathbf{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{w}})$  as data, while estimating the elements of  $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ . To describe this test, notice that (2.4) applies across all countries i. Focusing on a single industry j, and letting the elements of  $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$  be written as  $\beta_{jk}$ , we can write (2.4) in scalar form as:

$$
\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{j}}^{\mathrm{i}} = \sum_{\mathrm{k} = 1}^{\mathrm{N}} \beta_{\mathrm{jk}} \left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{w}}\right), \quad \mathrm{i} = 1, \dots , \mathrm{C}. \tag {2.6}
$$

Notice that the summation in (2.6) is across factors, while the observations are across countries. Thus, to estimate this regression we would combine the observation for a single industry  $j$  across multiple countries  $i = 1,\dots,C$ , where the coefficients  $\beta_{jk}$  are estimated. These coefficients should be interpreted as Rybczynski effects, and as shown in chapter 1, can be positive or negative.

To run this regression, we first need to choose some aggregation scheme for net exports and factors of production. Leamer (1984) works with the trade data for 60 countries in two years, 1958 and 1975. The trade data is organized according to the Standard Industrial Trade Classification (SITC). Because these are traded goods, they include only merchandise, i.e. agriculture, mining and manufacturing. Leamer organizes these goods into 10 aggregates, as shown in the first column of Table 2.3: two primary products (petroleum and raw materials); four crops (forest products, tropical agricultural products, animal products and cereals); and four manufactured products (labor-intensive manufactures, capital-intensive manufactures, machinery and chemicals).[11] Implicitly there is an eleventh product in the economy, making up all the nontraded goods, so Leamer includes total GNP as an aggregate to reflect this. There are also eleven factors of production, listed along the top row of Table 2.3: capital, three types of workers (distinguished by skill), four types of land (distinguished by climate), and three natural resources. So the number of goods equals the number of factors by construction.

The estimates of  $\beta_{\mathrm{jk}}$  from regressing the 1975 net exports of each of these aggregates on the country factor endowments are shown in Table 2.3. Leamer stresses that the point estimates should not be taken too seriously, but the sign pattern of the coefficients is of interest, especially when the estimates are significantly different from zero. In interpreting the coefficients as Rybczynski effects, it is noteworthy to recall that an increase in the capital endowment is

associated with a rise in the net exports of all the manufactured goods, and the same is true for an increase in the endowments of nonprofessional or illiterate workers. Conversely, increases in most types of land, or of professional and technical workers, are associated with declines in the net exports of the manufactured products. The interpretation of these results is that increases in land favor agriculture over manufacturing, and increases in professional and technical workers favor non-traded services over manufacturing.

Because the estimated coefficients can be positive or negative they do not provide any basis to test the HOV Theorem. Instead, we have to rely on the overall fit of the regression: a linear relationship between endowments and trade, as in (2.6), is implied by the theory and can be assessed by the  $\mathbf{R}^2$  of the regressions. In the final column of Table 2.3 we show the  $\mathbf{R}^2$  from each cross-country regression, and these vary from 0.13 to nearly unity. Admittedly, these fits are a very weak test of the theory, because we generally do not want to rely on only the  $\mathbf{R}^2$  of an equation to judge the validity of the theory underlying it. So while this early approach of Leamer (1984) provides interesting results on the Rybczynski effects (as we shall refer to again in the next chapter), it is of limited usefulness in testing the HOV Theorem.

We summarize our results so far in Table 2.4, which indicates the data used and the basic methods of the various authors. These various "partial tests" have used only two sources of data, and we now turn to various complete tests of the HOV Theorem, using all three sources of data (trade, technology and factor endowments).

## Complete Test of the HOV Theorem

The first complete test of the HOV theorem was by Bowen, Leamer and Sveikaukas (1987). They proposed two tests of equation (2.1):

Sign test:  $\mathrm{sign(F_k^i) =sign(V_k^i -s^iV_k^w)},\qquad i = 1,\ldots ,C;k = 1,\ldots ,M;$

Rank test:  $\mathrm{F_k^i >F_\ell^i\iff(V_k^i -s^iV_k^w) > (V_\ell^i -s^iV_\ell^w),i =1,\ldots,C;k =1,\ldots,M.}$

The first of these tests simply compares the sign pattern on the left and right of (2.1). With M factors and C countries, there are MC observations in total, and we are interested in what percentage of these have the same sign on the two sides of the equation. Notice that a completely random pattern of signs such as obtained by flipping a coin would still generate correct signs  $50\%$  of the time in a large sample. Therefore, the sign test must do considerably better than this in order to conclude that the HOV Theorem is successful.

The rank test involves a pairwise comparison of all factors for each country, so there are  $\mathrm{M}(\mathrm{M} - 1) / 2$  pairs for each of C countries. If the computed factor contents of one factor exceeds that of a second factor, then we check whether the relative abundance of that first factor also exceeds the relative abundance of the second factor. Again, a completely random assignment of factor abundance and relative endowments would imply that in  $50\%$  of the comparisons in a large sample, the rank test would be satisfied, so we would hope that the actual data perform considerably better than this.

In fact, the sign and rank test both fail miserably when confronted with actual data. Using data for 27 countries and 12 factors, Bowen, Leamer and Sveikaukas found that the sign test was satisfied in about  $61\%$  of the cases, and the rank test was satisfied in about  $49\%$  of the cases: about what we would expect from flipping a coin. These negative results were confirmed in later calculations by Trefler (1995), with a sample of 33 countries and 9 factors, and his results for each country are shown in Table 2.5. Overall, the sign test was successful in only  $50\%$  of the

cases when using the U.S. technology to measure the matrix A (column (2) in Table 2.5). $^{12}$  The rank test was successful in only  $60\%$  of cases (column 4). This lack of success indicates that some assumption of the HOV model is drastically wrong!

Trefler (1995) performs several diagnostic tests on the data to determine which assumptions of the HOV model is most likely to be responsible for its failure, and concludes that the assumption of equal technologies across countries is especially bad. Accordingly, he develops an extended version of the HOV model that allows for different technologies across countries, as originally proposed by Leontief (1953) as one explanation for the "paradox."

## Modeling Different Technologies Across Countries

There are two ways that technological differences can be introduced into the HOV model. One approach is to model the productivity of factors in different countries, whereas another approach is to model differences in the factor requirements matrix  $A$ . These approaches are closely related, of course: saying that a factor is  $10\%$  less productive in one country is the same as saying that  $10\%$  more of that factor is needed per unit of production. But thinking about them as distinct will be convenient for our discussion.

Trefler (1993) takes the first approach, and allows all factors in every country to differ in their productivities. The only exception to this is for the U.S., which he uses as the benchmark country, with factor productivities normalized at unity. So let  $\pi_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  denote the productivity of factor k in country i relative to its productivity in the U.S. In terms of efficiency units, the

effective endowment of factor  $k$  in country  $i$  becomes  $\pi_k^i V_k^i$ . Let  $A$  now denote the amount of effective factors needed per unit of output in each industry. We continue to assume that factor-price equalization holds in terms of effective factor prices, so with identical technologies, the matrix  $A$  is the same across countries. Thus, we continue to measure the factor-content of trade as  $F^i \equiv AT^i$ . Then the HOV equation (2.1) is re-written in terms of effective factor endowments as:

$$
F_{k}^{i} = \pi_{k}^{i} V_{k}^{i} - s^{i} \sum_{j = 1}^{C} \pi_{k}^{j} V_{k}^{j}, \quad i = 1, \dots , C; k = 1, \dots , M. \tag {2.7}
$$

There are MC equations in (2.7), and M(C-1) productivity parameters. These equations are not independent, however. For any factor  $k$ , if we sum (2.7) across countries  $i = 1,\dots,C$  then we must obtain zero on both sides: exports equal imports for the world, even when measured in terms of factor contents. So we can drop the equations for one country, and we do so for the U.S. This leaves M(C-1) equations in M(C-1) parameters. These equations will be independent "almost everywhere," i.e. for almost all sets of data on endowments and factor-contents of trade. Furthermore, the productivity parameters enter (2.7) linearly, so the M(C-1) equations in (2.7) can be inverted to solve for these uniquely. Thus, we have established:

### Theorem (Trefler, 1993)

Allowing for all factors in all but one country to differ in their productivities  $\pi_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , for almost all datasets there will be a solution for productivities  $\pi_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  such that the HOV equation (2.7) hold with equality for  $\mathrm{i} = 1,\dots,\mathrm{C}$ ,  $\mathrm{k} = 1,\dots,\mathrm{M}$ .

The unusual feature of this result is that the HOV equation no longer becomes testable: it holds as an identity by the choice of productivity parameters! How, then, are we to judge

whether the HOV model is a reasonable description of reality or not? Trefler recommends two methods: first, we need to check whether the productivity parameters are positive (there is nothing in the inversion of (2.7) that guarantees this); second, we might compare these parameters to other economic data to evaluate how "reasonable" the productivity parameters are. For example, it makes sense to compare the labor productivity parameters to wages across countries. If factor-price equalization holds in terms of effective endowments, then it should be the case that the productivity parameters  $\pi_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  match the factor prices of country i quite closely.

In Figure 2.4, we show the results that Trefler (1993) obtains for labor. $^{13}$  On the horizontal axis we measure the estimated productivities  $\pi_{\ell}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , and on the vertical axis is data on wages across countries (both of these are relative to the U.S.). It is clear that the observations on these two variables across countries follow each other quite closely: the correlation between estimated  $\pi_{\ell}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and actual wages is 0.9. Since we think that cross-country differences in wages should indeed reflect workers productivities, this close correspondence between the two in Figure 2.4 lends support to Trefler's extension of the HOV model. $^{14}$

Turning to the second method of introducing productivity differences, Trefler (1995) allows the factor requirements matrix  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}$  to differ across countries, while assuming that the factor endowments do not differ in efficiency units. In this paper, he chooses to restrict the range of differences in matrices  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}$  so that the HOV equations give less than a perfect fit. This means that

we are back in the traditional econometric approach: choosing the parameters of  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}$  so as to minimize the sum of squared residuals of the HOV equations. To implement this, we need to model  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}$  in terms of some productivity differences across countries. The initial case that Trefler considers is where the matrices  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}$  differ by a uniform amount across countries:

$$
\delta^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{US}}, \tag {2.8}
$$

which implies  $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{US}} / \delta^{\mathrm{i}}$ . With  $\delta^{\mathrm{i}} < 1$ , this means that  $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} > \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{US}}$ , so that country i is less productive and requires more labor, capital, and other resources for a unit of production relative to the U.S..

With the assumption (2.8), we need to re-derive the HOV equation. From full-employment, we still have  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . We continue to make the assumption of identical and homothetic tastes across countries, so the factor content of trade is computed as:

$$
\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} \left(\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{w}}\right) = \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} \left(\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} \sum_{\mathrm{j} = 1}^{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}}\right). \tag {2.9}
$$

To make further progress with (2.9), let us multiply both sides by  $\delta^i$ . On the left, we would obtain  $\delta^i A^i T^i = A^{US} T^i \equiv F^{iUS}$ . That is, we define  $F^{iUS}$  as the factor-content of trade for country  $i$ , computed by using the U.S. factor requirements matrix. (Recall that this is what Leontief used, as well as all other researchers discussed above). By also multiplying the right of (2.9) by  $\delta^i$ , the matrix  $A^i$  appearing in the last term becomes instead  $\delta^i A^i = A^{US}$ . Since this term now does not depend on the country  $i$ , it can be brought inside the summation on the far right of (2.9), to obtain  $\sum_{j=1}^{C} A^{US} Y^j = \sum_{j=1}^{C} \delta^j A^j Y^j = \sum_{j=1}^{C} \delta^j V^j$ , where the final equality makes use of the full-

employment conditions in country  $j = 1, \dots, C$ . Substituting these results back into (2.9), we have therefore derived:

$$
F^{i U S} \equiv A^{U S} T^{i} = \delta^{i} V^{i} - \left(s^{i} \sum_{j = 1}^{C} \delta^{j} V^{j}\right). \tag {2.10}
$$

This becomes the statement of the HOV Theorem when we allow for uniform technological differences across countries: the factor-content of trade, measured with the U.S. technology on the left, should equal the relative factor endowments on the right, where these are each adjusted by the technological parameter of each country. Unlike equation (2.7), however, (2.10) will certainly not hold exactly. We therefore introduce an additive error, and choose the parameters  $\delta^i$  to minimize the sum of squared residuals of this equation.

The estimates for  $\delta^1$  obtained by Trefler (1995) from equation (2.10) are shown in column (6) of Table 2.5, and column (7) reports their asymptotic t-statistic to test the null hypothesis  $\delta^i = 1$ . Clearly, most countries have a technology that is significantly worse than that in the United States. Furthermore, these is a close relationship between  $\delta^i$  in column (6) and each country's GDP per-capita relative to the U.S. reported in column (1): the correlation between them is 0.89. If we presume that the differences in GDP per capita across countries are principally explained by technology, then this strong correlation lends support to the model.

How should we compare the models estimated by Trefler (1993) and Trefler (1995)? The complete set of cross-country factor productivity differences  $\pi_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  allows for a perfect fit in the HOV equations, but this is because there are so many "free" parameters. Allowing only scalar productivity differences  $\delta^{\mathrm{i}}$  is much more parsimonious, with (C-1) free parameters rather than M(C-1). One approach is to ask how much the fit of the HOV equations improves by this more

limited choice of parameters. That is, we can compare the variance of the left-side and estimated right-side of the HOV equation in (2.1), (2.7) or (2.10), and use this as a measure of the  $\mathbf{R}^2$  of the model. In conjunction with the "reasonableness" of the estimates themselves, this can be used to evaluate the model.

Consider the original HOV equations (2.1), without any productivity parameters at all. For Trefler's data, the variance of the factor contents  $\mathrm{F_k^i}$  relative to the variance of the country endowments  $\mathrm{V_k^i} - \mathrm{s^iV_k^w}$  turns out to be only 0.032! Trefler (1995) refers to this as the mystery of "missing trade": measured factor contents of trade are very small in comparison with relative endowments  $\mathrm{V_k^i} - \mathrm{s^iV_k^w}$ . At the other extreme, when we allow for the complete set of cross-country factor productivity differences  $\pi_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  then we obtain a perfect fit in the HOV equations (2.7), so that the ratio of the left-side and right-side is unity. In-between these, we can consider the uniform productivity differences  $\delta^{\mathrm{i}}$ , chosen to minimize the sum of squared residuals in (2.10). Then the  $\mathbf{R}^2$  from this equation turns out to be 0.486. In other words, nearly one-half of the "missing trade" is explained by allowing for uniform productivity differences across countries. This is an encouraging result! Re-computing the sign test – which compares the signs of the left and right-hand side of (2.10) – it turns out that the correct sign is obtained in 62% of cases (column (3) in table 6), rather than the 50% obtained without the scalar productivity differences  $\delta^{\mathrm{i}}$ .[15]

Trefler (1995) goes on to consider other modifications to the HOV framework, including

a limited set of factor productivity differences (allowed to differ between rich and poor countries), non-homothetic tastes, and a “home country” bias in consumption. He concludes that the contribution of these to further explaining “missing trade” is more limited, and prefers the initial model that allows for uniform productivity differences.[16]

## Using Data on Different Technologies Across Countries

The reader will notice in Table 2.4 that most complete tests of the HOV Theorem, using all three types of data, have still relied on the U.S. technology matrix. This is again due to data limitations: factor requirements for other countries, concorded to the same set of factors and industries, have only recently become available. $^{17}$  With the availability of this data, the next logical step is to make use of it to construct  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}$  across countries, rather than only using the U.S. technology matrix. This is the approach taken by Davis and Weinstein (2001a). We will defer a discussion of their approach until the next chapter, since it relies on material that we have not yet covered. We note at this point, however, that Davis and Weinstein are careful to estimate the differences in the technology matrices  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}$  across countries, rather than using the actual data for  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , since the latter approach would run the risk of having the constructed factor content of trade equal to the countries' relative endowments by construction. This is the same issue that Trefler (1993) had, where he allowed for enough productivity parameters for the HOV equations to fit perfectly. If the actual technology matrices are used to construct the factor content of trade, the HOV equation can again hold as an identity, as we now show.

In addition to using the actual data on  $\mathbf{A}^{\mathrm{i}}$  across countries, let us assume that the output of every good is distributed around the world in proportion to the purchasing country's GDP. $^{18}$  We now keep track of the bilateral trades between countries, so let  $\mathbf{X}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  denote the gross exports of goods from country  $i$  to country  $j$ . (Note that this is related to the net exports of country  $i$  by  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{i}} = \sum_{\mathrm{j} \neq i} \mathbf{X}^{\mathrm{ij}} - \sum_{\mathrm{j} \neq i} \mathbf{X}^{\mathrm{ji}}$ ). Using our assumption regarding the distribution of outputs around the world, the bilateral exports may be written as:

$$
\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}} \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}}, \tag {2.11}
$$

where  $s^j = \mathrm{GDP}^j / \mathrm{GDP}^w$  is the ratio of country  $j$ 's GDP to world GDP. $^{19}$  In order to measure the factor-content of these bilateral exports, we use the primary factor requirements of the exporting country  $i$ , and define  $F^{ij} \equiv A^i X^{ij}$  as the factor contents of exports from country  $i$  to country  $j$ . It follows from (2.11) that:

$$
\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{ij}} \equiv \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}} \mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}} \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}}, \tag {2.11'}
$$

where the final equality follows from full employment.

Using simple algebra we can re-write the relative endowments of country  $i$  as,

$$
\mathbf {V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathbf {s}^{\mathrm{i}} \left(\sum_{\mathrm{j}} \mathbf {V}^{\mathrm{j}}\right) = \left(1 - \mathbf {s}^{\mathrm{i}}\right) \mathbf {V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathbf {s}^{\mathrm{i}} \left(\sum_{\mathrm{j} \neq \mathrm{i}} \mathbf {V}^{\mathrm{j}}\right) = \left(\sum_{\mathrm{j} \neq \mathrm{i}} \mathbf {s}^{\mathrm{j}}\right) \mathbf {V}^{\mathrm{i}} - \mathbf {s}^{\mathrm{i}} \left(\sum_{\mathrm{j} \neq \mathrm{i}} \mathbf {V}^{\mathrm{j}}\right).
$$

Now make use of the factor content of exports in (2.11'),  $\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}}\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . This term is summed over

all destination countries  $j \neq i$ , and appears as the first term on the right of (2.12), which is interpreted as the factors used in country  $i$  to produce exports for all countries  $j \neq i$ . Similarly, the second term on the right of (2.12) is the factors used in every country  $j \neq i$  to produce exports to country  $i$ . Thus, using (2.11') to replace the terms on the right of (2.12), we have shown:

### Theorem (Trefler, 1998)

If the output of every good is distributed around the world in proportion to the purchasing country's GDP, then,

$$
V^{i} - s^{i} \left(\sum_{j} V^{j}\right) = \left(\sum_{j \neq i} F^{i j}\right) - \left(\sum_{j \neq i} F^{j i}\right). \tag {2.13}
$$

The first term on the right of (2.13) is the factor content of exports from country i to all countries  $j \neq i$ , and the second term is the factor content of imports from all countries  $j \neq i$  to country i. The factor content of country i's multilateral net exports is measured by the difference between these, and (2.13) therefore shows that the factor content of country i's multilateral net exports (on the right) equals its relative factor endowments (on the left). We stress that this HOV equation is automatically satisfied if the hypothesis of the theorem holds true.

This result, due to Trefler (1998), serves as a warning about using actual technology data to construct the factor content of trade. As in Trefler (1993) who allowed for unlimited differences in factor productivities across countries, using the actual technologies can quickly lead us to an identity between the factor content of trade and country's relative endowments, as in (2.13). This would not then be a test of the theory. Trefler (1998) further shows how this result can be extended to accommodate trade in intermediate inputs, and rightfully suggests that future work needs to take this identity into account.

## Other Tests of Trade

We conclude this chapter by briefly considering some other approaches to testing models of trade. We begin with the most general test of the "law of comparative advantage," as proposed by Deardorff (1984b), which does not depend on the Heckscher-Ohlin model at all. While this test is completely general, it unfortunately relies on information on autarky prices, which is seldom available. Accordingly, we move towards alternative tests of the HO model that do not rely on factor price equalization, and also do not require information on autarky prices. Such a test has been proposed by Helpman (1984a), building on the earlier work of Brecher and Choudhri (1982b). We shall review this test and the recent empirical application of Choi and Krishna (2001).

Deardorff's test of comparative advantage can be motivated with the simple 2x2x2 model with which we began this chapter. In Figure 2.2(a), the home country has its production shifted from point A to point B, and its consumption shifted from point A to point C, when moving from autarky to free trade. But both the shift in production and the shift in consumption can be linked by some inequalities that follow from profit-maximization and revealed-preference. To develop these, let us denote the autarky production of country i by the vector  $\mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{ia}}$ , the autarky price vector by  $\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{ia}}$ , and the free trade production by  $\mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . Then profit-maximization ensures that  $\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{ia}}, \mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{ia}} \geq \mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{ia}}, \mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . In other words, the value of production in autarky must exceed the value obtained if producers choose the feasible (but not optimal) point  $\mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{i}}$  instead. In autarky we also have that production equals consumption, so that  $\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{ia}}, \mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{ia}} = \mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{ia}}, \mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{ia}}$ . Now consider the consumption vector chosen under free trade,  $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . As is evident from Figure 2.2, and we will

prove carefully in chapter 6, the representative consumer is better off with this free-trade consumption than in autarky: there are gains from trade. It follows from revealed-preference that the representative consumer in country i could not afford the free-trade consumption vector at the autarky prices, that is,  $\mathrm{p^{ia} \cdot D^i \geq p^{ia} \cdot D^{ia}}$ . Pulling together these various inequalities, we therefore have,

$$
p^{i a}, D^{i} \geq p^{i a}, D^{i a} = p^{i a}, Y^{i a} \geq p^{i a}, Y^{i}. \tag {2.14}
$$

Comparing the first and last of these expressions, we see that  $p^{\mathrm{ia}} \left( D^i - Y^i \right) \geq 0$ . But since the net exports of country  $i$  are denoted by  $T^i = Y^i - D^i$ , it follows that  $p^{\mathrm{ia}} T^i \leq 0$ . Also, we have implicitly assumed above that trade is balanced for all countries, meaning that  $p^{\prime} T^i = 0$ , where  $p$  is the vector of free trade prices. Therefore, we have derived the key result of Deardorff (1984b):

$$
\left(p^{i a} - p\right)^{\prime} T^{i} \leq 0. \tag {2.15}
$$

In words, countries will tend to export those goods  $(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{j}}^{\mathrm{i}} > 0)$  whose autarky prices are below the trade prices, and import those goods  $(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{j}}^{\mathrm{i}} < 0)$  whose autarky prices are above the trade prices. This certainly held in our  $2 \times 2 \times 2$  model at the beginning of the chapter, where the home country exported good 1 (with  $\mathfrak{p} > \mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{a}}$ ) and imported good 2. The inequality in (2.15) shows that this type of result holds in general, with any number of goods and factors.

While we have derived this result for a comparison of autarky and free trade, Deardorff (1984b) shows that it also holds for a comparison of autarky with any form of trade that may be restricted by the use of tariffs. So we can measure the trade prices and quantities using actual

data, but as we have already mentioned, it is difficult to measure the autarky equilibrium. One unique case where this equilibrium was observed in historical data was Japan in the mid 1850s, which then rapidly moved to more open trade with the Meiji restoration in the late 1860s.

Bernhofen and Brown (2001) use data on Japan's pattern of trade from 1868 to 1872, together with various sources of autarky price information from around the 1850s, to directly test the prediction in (2.15). They find that this prediction is strongly confirmed, thereby supporting this general statement of comparative advantage.

To develop a test that does not rely on autarky information, let us return to the assumptions of the HO model: identical technologies across countries, with constant returns to scale. In contrast to our initial formulation of the HOV model, however, we no longer assume that FPE holds. We are then allowing the countries to be in different cones of diversification. When countries trade freely in goods at the price vector  $p$ , we denote the GDP of country  $i$  by  $G(p, V^i)$ , where  $V^i$  are the endowments of country  $i$ . Note that under our assumption of identical technologies, we do not need to index the GDP function itself by the country  $i$ . We again keep track of the bilateral trades between countries, and let  $X^{ij}$  denote the gross exports of goods from country  $i$  to country  $j$ . In order to measure the factor-content of these exports, we use the primary factor requirements of the exporting country  $i$ , and define  $F^{ij} \equiv A^i X^{ij}$  as the factor contents of exports from country  $i$  to country  $j$ , measured with the exporting country's technology.

Suppose, however, that rather than having country  $j$  import  $\mathbf{X}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  of goods, we directly allowed it to import the amount  $\mathbf{F}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  in factors. Under our maintained assumption that technologies are the same in both countries, it would be feasible for country  $j$  to directly produce

the amount  $X^{ij}$  in goods, using the same methods as employed in country i. In general,

however, country  $j$  could do better than that: because factor prices differ between the countries, the importing country might not want to use the same methods as the exporter, and will end up producing more by choosing methods attuned to its own factor prices. Thus, if we evaluated GDP in country  $j$  using the hypothetical factor imports  $\mathbf{F}^{\mathrm{ij}}$ , it must exceed the value obtained with the import of goods:

$$
\begin{array}{l} p^{\prime} (Y^{j} + X^{i j}) \leq G (p, V^{j} + F^{i j}) \\ \leq \mathrm{G} (\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{j}}) + \left[ \partial \mathrm{G} (\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{j}}) / \partial \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{j}} \right]^{\prime} \mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{ij}} \tag {2.16} \\ = \mathrm{p}^{\prime} \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}} + \mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{j}}^{\prime} \mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{ij}}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The second line of (2.16) follows because the GDP function is concave in the factor

endowments, and the last line follows because the derivative of the GDP function with respect to endowments equals the vector of factor prices  $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{j}}$ .

Taking the difference between the first and last lines of (2.16), we therefore have  $\mathsf{p}'\mathbf{X}^{\mathrm{ij}} \leq \mathsf{w}^{\mathrm{j}}\mathbf{F}^{\mathrm{ij}}$ , so that the value of bilateral exports in goods is less than the value of embodied factors, using the importing country's factor prices. If instead we had used the exporting country's factor prices, however, then with constant returns to scale the value of output would just equal the value of factors used, so that  $\mathsf{p}'\mathbf{X}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathsf{w}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathbf{F}^{\mathrm{ij}}$ . Combining this with the previous inequality we therefore have:

$$
\left(\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{j}} - \mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{i}}\right)^{\prime} \mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{ij}} \geq 0. \tag {2.17}
$$

Furthermore, by repeating this exercise but focusing on net exports from country  $j$  to country  $i$ , measured using country  $j$ 's technology, we can derive that:

$$
\left(\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{j}} - \mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{i}}\right)^{\prime} \mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{ji}} \leq 0. \tag {2.18}
$$

Putting together these two inequalities, we therefore obtain the key result of Helpman (1984a):

$$
\left(\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{j}} - \mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{i}}\right)^{\prime} \left(\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{ij}} - \mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{ji}}\right) \geq 0. \tag {2.19}
$$

These inequalities can be interpreted as saying that factors embodied in trade should flow towards the country with higher factor price, i.e. if factor  $k$  has a higher price in country  $j$ ,  $(w_{k}^{j} - w_{k}^{i}) > 0$ , then we should have  $F_{k}^{ij} > 0$  in (2.17) or  $F_{k}^{ji} < 0$  in (2.18) for at least some factors  $k$ , so that (2.17)-(2.19) hold when we add up across factors.

To summarize, (2.17)-(2.19) give us testable hypotheses on bilateral factor-content of trade between countries, that do not depend on FPE, though they do presume identical technologies. Choi and Krishna (2001) implement this test for bilateral trade flows between eight countries (Canada, Demark, France, Germany, Korea, Netherlands, the U.K. and the U.S.) using data for 1980. They considered two different ways of measuring the rental price of capital, and two different levels of disaggregating labor. Considering first the one-way trade flows in (2.17) and (2.18), they find that these equations have the correct sign in about  $52\%$  to  $55\%$  of cases, depending on the methods used for measuring factors. Even when a one-way flow has the incorrect sign, but is small in magnitude, it is still possible that the two-way factor flow in equation (2.19) will have the correct sign. This is confirmed by Choi and Krishna, who find that the combined equation (2.19) is satisfied for  $72\%$  to  $75\%$  of cases, which is a quite respectable success rate.

Choi and Krishna (2001) also show how (2.17) and (2.18) can be generalized to allow for scalar technological differences across countries, much like in (2.8). In that case, they find that the one-way trade flows in (2.17) and (2.18) have the correct sign in  $55\%$  to  $59\%$  of cases, while the two-way trade flows in (2.19) have the correct sign in  $79\%$  of cases. It is somewhat surprising that correcting for scalar technology differences between countries did not lead to a greater improvement in the test results, but then again, this correction improved the "sign test" for Trefler (1995) from  $50\%$  to only  $62\%$ . Trefler's acceptance of the scalar productivity differences as an improvement over the conventional HOV model was based on other criterion, and in particular, their ability to help explain the "missing trade." For the bilateral flows analyzed by Choi and Krishna, the fact that the combined equation (2.19) – emphasized by Helpman (1984a) – is satisfied in about three-quarters of cases indicates support for the theory, and suggests that dropping FPE is an important direction for further research.

## Conclusions

We started this chapter with the Leontief paradox, and after explaining this away using the results of Leamer (1980), went on to argue that the complete tests of the HOV model fail sadly under the conventional assumptions of this model: identical homothetic tastes and identical technologies with FPE across countries. As we begin to loosen these assumptions, the model performs better, and when we allow for unlimited differences in productivities of factors across countries, as in Trefler (1993), then the resulting HOV equations will hold as an identity. Between these two extremes, Trefler (1995) shows that a parsimonious specification of technological differences between countries – allowing for a uniform difference with the U.S. – is still able to greatly improve the fit of the HOV equation. Recent research such as Davis and Weinstein (2001a), which we review in the next chapter, generalizes these technological

differences and further explains how we account for the differences between the factor content of trade and relative endowments.

So what is left for further research? While it is dangerous to predict the course of future research, we can suggest two areas that deserve further attention. First, it is worth making a distinction between accounting for global trade volumes and testing hypotheses related to trade. When we attempt to match the right and left-hand sides of the HOV equation, such as by introducing productivity parameters, we are engaged in an accounting exercise. With enough free parameters this is bound to lead to equality of the HOV equation, as we found in (2.13) which uses the actual technologies of each country, but relies on an assumption about exports. On the other hand, when we test hypotheses such as (2.17)-(2.19) then we are making use of economic behavior: the GDP function is concave in the factor endowments, leading to (2.17)-(2.19), if and only if producers economize on factor inputs when their prices rise. There seems to be a difference between these two approaches, and ordinarily in economics, we are more interesting in testing economic behavior.

Second, even if we accept that the HOV equation can fit perfectly by allowing for sufficient differences between technologies across countries, this begs the question: where do these differences in technology come from? In the original work of Heckscher and Ohlin, they rejected the technology differences assumed by Ricardo in favor of a world where knowledge flowed across borders. We have since learned that this assumption of technological similarity across countries was empirically false at the time they wrote (see Estevadeordal and Taylor, 2000, 2001), as well as in recent years (Trefler, 1993, 1995; Davis and Weinstein, 2001a). So we are back in the world of Ricardo, where technological differences are a major determinant of trade patterns. Such differences can hardly be accepted as exogenous, however, and surely must

be explicable based on underlying causes. Increasing returns to scale might be one explanation, and this has been incorporated into the HOV framework by Antweiler and Trefler (2002) as will be discussed in chapter 5. Economy-wide increasing returns are also suggested by the literature on "endogenous growth," which we will discuss in chapter 10. Beyond this, some recent authors have argued that geography/climate (Sachs, 2001), or colonial institutions (Acemoglu, et al, 2001), or social capital (Jones and Hall, 1999), or the efficiency with which labor is utilized (Clark and Feenstra, 2001) must play an important role. Whatever the answer, this issue will no doubt occupy researchers for some years to come.

## Problems

2.1 Suppose that the factor content of trade is zero on the left of equation (2.7). Then solve for the implied values of the productivities  $\pi_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  in one country relative to another.
2.2 An assumption of the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model, as outlined in this chapter, is that tastes are identical across countries and also homothetic. The latter is an unrealistic assumption because of Engel's Law: expenditures on food are a declining share of total income. Following Hunter and Markusen (1989), we can introduce non-homothetic tastes using a linear expenditure system. Denoting per-capital consumption of good  $i$  in any country  $j$  by  $d_i^j$ , we suppose that the utility function is given by:

$$
U^{j} = \prod_{i = 1}^{N} \left(d_{i}^{j} - \bar {d}_{i}\right)^{\phi_{i}}, \quad \text{wi th} \quad \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \phi_{i} = 1.
$$

The parameters  $\overline{\mathrm{d}}_{\mathrm{i}} \geq 0$  in the utility function are interpreted as the "minimum consumption" of each commodity  $i = 1, \dots, N$ . They are assumed to be the same across countries, as are the parameters  $\phi_{\mathrm{i}} > 0$ .

(a) Assuming that per-capita income  $\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{j}}$  is large enough to afford the "minimum consumption", then show that per-capita demand for each commodity in country j is given by:

$$
\mathsf {d}_{\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{j}} = \overline {{\mathsf {d}}}_{\mathrm{i}} + \phi_{\mathrm{i}} (\mathsf {I}^{\mathrm{j}} - \sum_{\mathrm{j} = 1}^{\mathsf {M}} \mathsf {p}_{\mathrm{j}} \overline {{\mathsf {d}}}_{\mathrm{j}}) / \mathsf {p}_{\mathrm{i}},
$$

where  $p_j$ ,  $j = 1, \dots, N$ , are the commodity prices.

(b) Assuming that prices are the same across countries due to free trade, we can normalize them at unity, and rewrite demand in the more compact form,

$$
\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{j}} = \delta_{\mathrm{i}} + \phi_{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{j}},
$$

where  $\delta_{\mathrm{i}} \equiv (\overline{\mathrm{d}}_{\mathrm{i}} - \phi_{\mathrm{i}} \sum_{\mathrm{j} = 1}^{\mathrm{M}} \overline{\mathrm{d}}_{\mathrm{j}})$  are the values of "minimum consumption" measured relative to their mean. Interpret the coefficients  $\delta_{\mathrm{i}}$ .

(c) Multiply the per-capita demand by country population  $\mathbf{L}^{\mathrm{j}}$ , to obtain total demand,

$\mathrm{D_i^j =L^jd_i^j = \delta_iL^j + \phi_iE^j}$ , where  $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{j}}\equiv \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{j}}\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{j}}$  denotes total expenditure in country j. We can write this in vector notation as,  $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{j}} = \delta \mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{j}} + \phi \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{j}}$ . Using this demand function, re-derive the HOV equation (2.1), and interpret the new equation.

## Empirical Exercises

In these exercises, you will reproduce some of the empirical results from Trefler (1993, 1995). To complete the exercise, the Excel file "hov_pub.csv" should be stored in the directory: c:\Empirical_Exercise\Chapter_2\hov_pub.csv. After this, run the STATA program "hov_pub.do", which will create a new STATA data file "trefler.dta". Then do:

2.1 Given identical technologies across countries, run the program "sign_rank_1.do" to conduct the sign test, rank test, and test for missing trade. Use the results in "sign_rank_1.log" to replicate columns (2) and (4) in Table 2.5.
2.2 Given uniform technological differences across countries, run the program "sign_rank_2.do" to redo the sign test, rank test, and missing trade. Use the results in "sign_rank_2.log" to replicate column (3) and (5), given column (6) in Table 2.5.
2.3 Allowing all factors in each country to have different productivities, now run the program "compute_pi.do" to compute factor productivities  $\pi_{\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  as Trefler (1993). Note that there are 9 factors in the original data set, but these are now aggregated to just 4 factors, which are labor (endowment 1), capital (endowment 2), cropland (endowment 3) and pasture (endowment 4). Using the results in "pi.log" or alternatively in the data files "pi_1.dta, pi_2.dta, pi_3.dta, pi_4.data" to answer the following:
(a) Which factor has the most negative productivities estimated?
(b) What is the correlation between the estimated labor productivity and the productivities of other factors? What is the correlation between each factor productivity and GDP per-capita (which you can find in the file "trefler.dta")?
