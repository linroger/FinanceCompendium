# Chapter 3: Many Goods and Factors

The Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model we studied in the previous chapter allowed for many goods and factors, but for much of that discussion we maintained the assumption of factor price equalization. This theorem was proved in chapter 1 only for the case of two goods and two factors (and no factor intensity reversals). A natural question to ask is with many goods and factors, will factor price equalization continue to hold? More generally, what happens to the other theorems we discussed in chapter 1 – the Stolper-Samuelson and Rybczynski Theorems? Are there some generalizations of these that apply to the many good and many factor case? These are the topics we shall address in this chapter.

We begin with the case where the number of goods and factors is the same, the so-called "even" case. We will see that the factor price equalization theorem naturally generalizes from the case of two goods and two factors to N goods and N factors. Versions of the Stolper-Samuelson and Rybczynski Theorems also continue to hold, though not quite as strong as we obtained in the two-by-two case.
