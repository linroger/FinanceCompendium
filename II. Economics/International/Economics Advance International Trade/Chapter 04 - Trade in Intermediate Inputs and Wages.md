# Chapter 4: Trade in Intermediate Inputs and Wages

Since the early 1980s there has been a marked change in the pattern of wage payments in the United States: the wage of skilled relative to unskilled workers experienced a sustained increase, that continued through the 1990s. A similar pattern was observed in other countries. This led to a great deal of research on the possible causes of the change in relative wages. From the material we have already covered, we can identify three methods to determine whether the change in relative wages is due to international trade.

First, we could estimate a GDP or cost function for the U.S. economy, or for specific industries, and compute the Stolper-Samuelson effect of a change in traded goods prices. We will discuss this approach at several points throughout the chapter. Second, we could proceed as in the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model and compute the change in the factor content of trade and associated changes in factor prices. Theoretically, this second approach is justified by Deardorff and Staiger (1988), who show that:

$$
\left(\mathrm {w} ^ {2} - \mathrm {w} ^ {1}\right) \left(\mathrm {F} ^ {2} - \mathrm {F} ^ {1}\right) \geq 0, \tag {4.1}
$$

where  $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{i}}$  are equilibrium wages in a country in two equilibria  $\mathrm{i} = 1,2$ , and  $\mathbf{F}^{\mathrm{i}}$  is the factor-content of exports for that country. Equation (4.1) is interpreted as saying that a higher content of imports for some factor  $\mathrm{k}$ ,  $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{2} < \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{1} < 0$  so  $(\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{2} - \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{k}}^{1}) < 0$ , will tend to be associated with a falling wage for that factor,  $(\mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{k}}^{2} - \mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{k}}^{1}) < 0$ . The same would be true for the direct import of a factor, as with immigration. Among the most careful assessment of these effects for the United States,

Borjas, Freeman and Katz (1997, p. 62) find that immigration into the U.S. during 1980-1995 accounts for about one-quarter to one-half of the decline in the relative wages of high-school dropouts. The increasing factor content of imports from less-developed countries also has some effect on reducing the wages of high-school dropouts, but by less than immigration. Both channels have only a small impact on the wages of more highly-educated workers.

Note the similarity between (4.1), which refers to a comparison over time, and equation (2.19) (from Helpman, 1984a), which referred to a comparison across countries. This suggests that all the observations we have made about testing the HOV model apply equally well to implementing formula (4.1): the results of a factor-content approach when applied over time will depend on the assumptions about technology (which year or country's technology matrix is used); assumptions on tastes; and also whether or not there are traded intermediate inputs.[2] For these reasons, there is considerable controversy about the suitability of using a factor-content approach to infer the effects of trade on wages.[3]

These concerns suggest a third approach: rather than relying on an HOV equation, let us directly model the presence of traded intermediate inputs, caused by firms splitting apart their production process across several countries. This is sometimes called "production sharing" by the companies involved, or simply "outsourcing."4 The idea that trade in intermediate inputs can have an effect on production and factor prices that is different from trade in final goods is

gaining widespread acceptance among trade economists, $^{5}$  and no graduate trade course today is complete without a discussion of this topic (I think the same is true at the undergraduate level). Fortunately, the tools we have developed in the previous chapters can be readily extended to deal with trade in intermediate inputs.

After reviewing the initial evidence concerning the change in wages for the U.S. in the next section, we present a simple three-good, three-factor model that can be used to analyze the link between input prices and wages. Two of the goods are traded intermediate inputs, and the third is a final product. It is readily shown that a fall in the price of imported intermediate inputs decreases the relative wage of the factor used intensively in those imports, which would be unskilled labor for the U.S. Next, we generalize this model and present a version with a continuum of inputs, analogous to the Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1980) model. With the U.S. being more abundant in skilled labor than abroad, the model predicts that a growth in capital or technology abroad will lead to increased outsourcing from the U.S., and an increase in the relative wage of skilled labor in both countries. Following this we discuss various methods of estimating the model, and summarize evidence for the U.S. and other countries.

# Changes in Wages and Employment

The basic facts concerning wage movements in the United States are well understood. $^6$  For full-time U.S. workers between 1979 and 1995, the real wages of those with 12 years of education fell by  $13.4\%$  and the real wages of those with less than 12 years of education fell by  $20.2\%$ . During the same period, the real wages of workers with 16 or more years of education rose by  $3.4\%$ , so that the wage gap between less-skilled and more-skilled workers increased

dramatically. $^{7}$  To illustrate these trends, we can use data from the U.S. manufacturing sector for "nonproduction" and "production" workers. The former are often used as a proxy for more-skilled workers, and the latter as a proxy for less-skilled workers. The breakdown is far from perfect, of course, but has been used because the data are readily available. $^{8}$  These trends are shown in Figure 4.1, which graphs the relative annual earnings of nonproduction/production workers in U.S. manufacturing, and Figure 4.2, which illustrates their relative annual employment.

In Figure 4.1, we see that earnings of nonproduction relative to production workers in the U.S. moved erratically during the 1960s and 1970s, but then increased substantially during the 1980s and 1990s. Turning to Figure 4.2, we see that there has been a steady increase in the ratio of nonproduction to production workers used in U.S. manufacturing, with some leveling off recently. This increase in the supply of workers can account for the reduction in the relative wage of nonproduction workers from 1970 to the early 1980s, as shown in Figure 4.1, but is at odds with the increase in the relative nonproduction wage after that. The rising relative wage should have led to a shift in employment away from skilled workers, along a demand curve, but it has not. Thus, the only explanation consistent with these facts is that there has been an outward shift in the demand for more-skilled workers since the mid-1980s, leading to an increase in their relative employment and wages.[9]

What factors could lead to an outward shift in the relative demand for skilled labor in the economy? One explanation suggested by the two-sector model is that the output of skill-intensive sectors have risen relative to those of unskilled-labor intensive sectors: this would certainly increase the relative demand for skilled labor. However, the evidence for the U.S. is that this sort of sectoral change in outputs did not occur. Rather, the bulk of the increase in the relative demand for skilled labor occurred within the manufacturing industries, and not by shifts in labor between industries. Some evidence on this within versus between industry distinction is contained in Table 4.1, which is taken from Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994).

Table 4.1 decomposes the change in the relative employment and relative wages of nonproduction workers into those that occurred within and between industries. We can see that in the period 1979-1987, the relative employment of nonproduction workers increased by slightly more than one-half of one percent per year (0.55%), with about two-thirds of that (0.36%) explained by within industry movements. On the wage side, the relative annual earnings of nonproduction workers increased by about seven-tenths of a percentage point per year (0.72%), with more than half of that change (0.41%) explained by within industry movements. The conclusion suggested by Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994) is that trade cannot be a dominant explanation for the wage and employment shifts, because the between industries movements are smaller than the within industry movements.

This conclusion was reinforced by consideration of the price movements. If the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem holds, then the relative price of skilled labor in the U.S. would increase if the relative price of skill-intensive goods also increased, e.g. the price of computers rose relative to the price of apparel. In fact, this did not occur during the 1980s.[10] This can be seen from

Table 4.2, which is taken from the work of Lawrence and Slaughter (1993) and Lawrence (1994). For each country, the first row is a weighted average of the change in manufacturing prices over the 1980s, where the weights are the industry's share of total manufacturing employment of nonproduction workers. The second row is again the weighted average of the change in prices over the 1980s, but now using the industry's share of employment of production workers. For U.S. import prices, for example, we can see that when industries are weighted by their production workers, the average price increase is higher than when they are weighted by non-production workers. The same pattern can be seen by comparing the rows for other industrial countries. This means that some of the industries that use the most production – or less-skilled – workers are those with the highest price increases. This finding led Lawrence and Slaughter (1993) to conclude that the price movements, due to international competition, could not explain the wage movements.

The price movements shown in Table 4.2, combined with the shift in relative demand towards skilled labor within industries as shown in Table 4.1, led many economists to conclude that international trade could not be a substantial explanation for the rise in relative wages. Instead, they have looked to the introduction of skill-biased technological changes, such the introduction of computers, to provide the explanation. But should we really rule out trade? It may be true that the Heckscher-Ohlin model does not provide the explanation for the change in wages during the 1980s and 1990s. But surely trade can have an important impact on the structure of production, and demand for labor, within industries as well. This is certainly the case when we introduce trade in intermediate inputs: as we shall see, trade can then affect labor demand within an industry.

Note: The averages shown weigh each industry's price change by that industry's share of total manufacturing employment or nonproduction and non-manual workers, or production and manual workers. Industries are defined at the 3-digit SIC level for the U.S., and generally correspond to the 2-digit level for Japan and Germany.

Some preliminary evidence which suggests that trade shifts the composition of activity within an industry is provided by Bernard and Jensen (1997), who do the same decomposition as Berman, Bound and Griliches but with plant-level data rather than industry-level data. This is shown in Table 4.3. Looking again at the period 1979-1987, we can see that nearly one-half of the relative increase in the employment of non-production workers  $(0.39\%)$  occurred as a result of the shifts between plants  $(0.18\%)$ , and more than one-half of the increase in the relative wage of non-production workers  $(0.54\%)$  is also explained by movements between manufacturing plants  $(0.32\%)$ . Furthermore, Bernard and Jensen found that the plants experiencing the greatest increase in relative nonproduction employment and earnings are precisely those that were engaged in exporting.

The results of Bernard and Jensen provide prima facie evidence that trade has had an impact on factor demand and wages, through shifting the demand for labor within industries. In order to understand how these shifts due to trade can occur, we present in the next section a simple model of outsourcing.

# Trade in Intermediate Inputs: a Simple Model

Of the many activities that take place within any industry, let us identify just three: the production of an unskilled-labor intensive input, denoted by  $y_{1}$ ; the production of a skilled-labor intensive input, denoted by  $y_{2}$ , and the "bundling together" of these two goods into a finished product. The two intermediate inputs are produced at home and also traded internationally. We shall simplify the analysis, however, by assuming that the production of these two inputs and the "bundling" activity are always performed at home. Thus, we are ruling out "corner solutions" where one of these activities is done entirely abroad. In reality, corner solutions such as this are very common: e.g., many U.S. firms export intermediate inputs to the maquiladora plants in

Mexico, where assembly of the inputs and other production activities take place rather than in the U.S.. A model that emphasizes the movement of entire activities across countries is presented in the next section.

We will suppose that the two inputs  $y_{i}$ ,  $i = 1,2$ , are each produced using unskilled labor  $(L_{i})$ , skilled labor  $(H_{i})$ , and capital  $(K_{i})$ , with concave and linearly homogeneous production functions,

$$
\mathrm {y} _ {\mathrm {i}} = \mathrm {f} _ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \mathrm {H} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right), \quad \mathrm {i} = 1, 2. \tag {4.2}
$$

For example, the unskilled-labor intensive input  $y_{1}$  might represent the activities done within a factory, while the skilled-labor intensive input  $y_{2}$  might represent the research and development activities within the industry, as well as marketing and after-sales service. These are both needed to produce the final manufacturing product. But some of the activities done within the factory can instead be outsourced, i.e. imported from abroad; and conversely, the services associated with research, development and marketing can be exported to support production activities abroad. We therefore let  $x_{1} < 0$  denote the imports of input 1, and  $x_{2} > 0$  denote the exports of input 2. Also let  $p_{i}$  denote the price of each input,  $i = 1,2$ , and let  $p = (p_{1},p_{2})$  denote the price vector of the traded intermediate inputs.

The production of the final good is given by  $y_{n} = f_{n}(y_{1} - x_{1}, y_{2} - x_{2})$ , where this production function "bundles together" the amounts of goods 1 and 2 available, and is also concave and linearly homogeneous. We ignore any additional labor and capital inputs used in this bundling activity, so that the total factor usage in the manufacturing industry is,

$$
\mathrm {L} _ {1} + \mathrm {L} _ {2} = \mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \quad \mathrm {H} _ {1} + \mathrm {H} _ {2} = \mathrm {H} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \quad \mathrm {K} _ {1} + \mathrm {K} _ {2} = \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {n}}. \tag {4.3}
$$

We can now solve for the optimal output in the industry, which includes the three activities. With perfect competition, the value of output from the final good, plus net trade, will be maximized subject to the resource constraints:

$$
\mathrm {G} _ {\mathrm {n}} \left(\mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {H} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {p}\right) \equiv \max  _ {\mathrm {x} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \mathrm {H} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {i}}} \quad \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {n}} \mathrm {f} _ {\mathrm {n}} \left(\mathrm {y} _ {1} - \mathrm {x} _ {1}, \mathrm {y} _ {2} - \mathrm {x} _ {2}\right) + \mathrm {p} _ {1} \mathrm {x} _ {1} + \mathrm {p} _ {2} \mathrm {x} _ {2}, \tag {4.4}
$$

subject to (4.2), (4.3),

where  $p_n$  is the price of the final good, and  $p$  is the price vector of the traded intermediate inputs. The value of (4.4) can be thought of as value-added for the industry, i.e. output including exports  $p_2 x_2$  less the value of intermediate inputs  $p_1 x_1$ . Note that this function is very similar to the GDP function introduced in chapter 1, but now we apply it to each of the  $n = 1, \dots, N$  manufacturing industries. When applied to specific industries, it is common to call (4.4) a revenue function.

Note that the optimization problem in (4.4) does not require that trade is balanced on an industry-by-industry basis, i.e. we do not require that  $\mathsf{p}_1\mathbf{x}_1 + \mathsf{p}_2\mathbf{x}_2 = 0$ . Of course, there will be some balance of trade constraint for the economy overall, but we ignore that here. Problem (4.4) can be easily illustrated, as in Figure 4.3, where we show the production possibility frontier between inputs 1 and 2, and several isoquants of the final good  $\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{n}}$ . For the purpose of illustration we now add the condition that trade in inputs is balanced,  $\mathsf{p}_1\mathbf{x}_1 + \mathsf{p}_2\mathbf{x}_2 = 0$ , so that the output of the final good is maximized on the isoquant that is tangent to the balanced trade line. At initial prices, for example, the industry produces inputs at point A, and then trades to point B. With a drop in the relative price of the imported input, the industry shifts production towards the skilled-labor intensive activity at point  $\mathbf{A}'$ , and then trades to point  $\mathbf{B}'$ , obtaining a higher output  $\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{n}}$ . All this will look very familiar to readers from the similar discussion for an economy in

Figure 4.3

chapter 1: the special feature of Figure 4.3 is that we now think of these activities taking place within a single manufacturing industry.

How will the drop in the relative price of imported inputs affect factor prices? To answer this, we can use the zero-profit conditions for producing inputs 1 and 2, which are,

$$
p _ {i} = c _ {i} (w, q, r). \tag {4.5}
$$

These conditions must hold in order for the locally produced inputs  $y_{i}$ ,  $i = 1,2$ , to be competitive with those available from abroad, at the international prices  $p_{i}$ . Totally differentiating (4.5) and using the Jones' algebra (as in chapter 1), we can express the percentage change in factor prices  $\hat{w}$ ,  $\hat{q}$ , and  $\hat{r}$  as functions of the percentage change in prices  $\hat{p}_{i}$ :

$$
\hat {\mathrm {p}} _ {\mathrm {i}} = \theta_ {\mathrm {i L}} \hat {\mathrm {w}} + \theta_ {\mathrm {i H}} \hat {\mathrm {q}} + \theta_ {\mathrm {i K}} \hat {\mathrm {r}}, \tag {4.6}
$$

where  $\theta_{ij}$  is the cost-share of factor  $j$  in activity  $i$ , with  $\sum_{j} \theta_{ij} = 1$ .

Treating the change in the traded price  $\hat{\mathbf{p}}_{\mathrm{i}}$  as exogenous, (4.6) gives two equations with which to determine three unknown factor prices changes -  $\hat{\mathbf{w}}$ ,  $\hat{\mathbf{q}}$ , and  $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ . In general, these factor price changes will be difficult to pin down with only two equations. In terms of Figure 4.3, when production shifts towards the skilled labor-intensive activity, from point A to point A', we do not know in general how factor prices are affected. But there are some simplifying assumptions we can make which allow us to determine these.

Let us assume that capital has equal cost shares in the two industries, so that  $\theta_{1\mathrm{K}} = \theta_{2\mathrm{K}}$ . Using this, we take the difference between the two equations in (4.6) to obtain,

$$
\hat {\mathrm {p}} _ {1} - \hat {\mathrm {p}} _ {2} = (\theta_ {1 \mathrm {L}} - \theta_ {2 \mathrm {L}}) \hat {\mathrm {w}} + (\theta_ {1 \mathrm {H}} - \theta_ {2 \mathrm {H}}) \hat {\mathrm {q}} = (\theta_ {1 \mathrm {L}} - \theta_ {2 \mathrm {L}}) (\hat {\mathrm {w}} - \hat {\mathrm {q}}), \tag {4.7}
$$

where the second equality follows since with equal cost shares of capital, the total cost shares of labor are also equal, so that  $(\theta_{1L} + \theta_{1H}) = (\theta_{2L} + \theta_{2H}) \Rightarrow (\theta_{1L} - \theta_{2L}) = -(\theta_{1H} - \theta_{2H})$ . With activity 1 assumed to be unskilled-labor intensive, we have that  $(\theta_{1L} - \theta_{2L}) > 0$ . Thus, (4.7) says that a decrease in the relative price of imported intermediate input,  $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 < 0$ , leads to a decrease in the relative wage of unskilled labor,  $(\hat{w} - \hat{q}) = (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) / (\theta_{1L} - \theta_{2L}) < 0$ .

These results are illustrated in Figure 4.4, where we graph the iso-curves of  $c_i(w, q, r)$ . With the wages of unskilled and skilled labor labeled on the axis, we are implicitly holding fixed the rental on capital,  $r$ . Now suppose that there is a fall in the price  $p_1$  of activity 1, which is unskilled-labor intensive. In Figure 4.4, this will shift inwards the iso-cost line of that activity, and as shown, will lead to a fall in the relative wage of unskilled labor (from point A to point B). There will be some additional change in the rental on capital, but under our assumption of equal cost share of capital in the two industries, this will lead to an equi-proportional shift in the two iso-cost curves and therefore have no further effect on the relative wage. Thus, the drop in the price of the imported inputs leads to a fall in the relative wage ( $w/q$ ) of unskilled labor.

We can also ask what happens to the price of the final good  $p_n$ . Let  $c_n(p_1, p_2)$  denote the unit-cost function that is dual to  $f_n(y_1, y_2)$ , whereby the final good is assembled from the two intermediate inputs. Then the price of the final good satisfies  $p_n = c_n(p_1, p_2)$ , so that  $\hat{p}_n = \theta_{n1} \hat{p}_1 + \theta_{n2} \hat{p}_2$ , where  $\theta_{ni}$  is the cost-share of input  $i$  in the final product. Thus, the change in the price of the final good is a weighted average of the change in the input prices. In particular, with a fall in the relative price of imported inputs,  $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 < 0$ , the price of the final

good satisfies  $\hat{\mathfrak{p}}_1 < \hat{\mathfrak{p}}_{\mathrm{n}} < \hat{\mathfrak{p}}_2$ . Stated differently, the price of the final good relative to imported inputs rises,  $\hat{\mathfrak{p}}_{\mathrm{n}} - \hat{\mathfrak{p}}_{1} > 0$ .

Thus, our model of outsourcing suggests a different way of looking at the link between product prices and factor prices. Rather that comparing prices across different industries, depending on their skill-intensity, it now makes sense to compare import and domestic prices within each industry. The types of goods being imported within each industry (e.g., auto parts) are not the same as those being sold domestically (e.g., finished autos). Indeed, as U.S. firms find imported inputs at increasingly lower prices – through outsourcing activities that they used to do at home – we would expect to see that U.S. prices within each industry rising relative to import prices. In terms of Table 4.2, we should be comparing the price changes across columns rather than across rows. Looking at the United States, we see that during the 1980s it is indeed the case that domestic prices rose faster than import prices, and the same is true for Japan and Germany. These price movements are entirely consistent with the model of foreign outsourcing, whereby the United States and other industrial countries are continually seeking lower-cost sources of supply. Based on this logic, there is no “contradiction” at all between the movement of prices and relative wages!

# Continuum of Inputs

The model we have presented above can be readily extended to incorporate a continuum of inputs, as in Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1997). Let the index  $z \in [0,1]$  denote the many activities undertaken in the creation, production and delivery of a product to the consumer.

Rather than listing these activities in their temporal order, we will instead list them in increasing order of skilled/unskilled labor, where for example, the least skill-intensive activity is assembly and the most skill-intensive activity is R&D. Letting  $\mathrm{x(z)}$  denote the quantity produced of each

one of these inputs, we let  $\mathrm{a_H(z)}$  and  $\mathrm{a_L(z)}$  denote the skilled and unskilled labor, respectively, needed to produce one unit of  $\mathrm{x(z)}$ . As stated, we will order the activities  $\mathrm{z}$  so that  $\mathrm{a_H(z) / a_L(z)}$  is non-decreasing in  $\mathrm{z}$ .

We will suppose that there are two countries, with the foreign country denoted by an asterisk. The production functions for producing the two inputs are assumed to be the same up to a Hick's-neutral productivity parameter in each country:

$$
\mathrm {x} (\mathrm {z}) = \mathrm {A} \left[ \min  \left\{\frac {\mathrm {L} (\mathrm {z})}{\mathrm {a} _ {\mathrm {L}} (\mathrm {z})}, \frac {\mathrm {H} (\mathrm {z})}{\mathrm {a} _ {\mathrm {H}} (\mathrm {z})} \right\} \right] ^ {\theta} \mathrm {K} ^ {1 - \theta}, \quad \mathrm {z} \in [ 0, 1 ]. \tag {4.8}
$$

Thus, the amount of skilled and unskilled labor  $\mathrm{H(z)}$  and  $\mathrm{L(z)}$  are used in the home country to produce input  $\mathbf{z}$ , using a Leontief technology between these two types of labor, and then a Cobb-Douglas technology between labor overall and capital  $\mathrm{K}$ . The parameter  $\theta$  denotes the share of labor in the costs of producing each input. The foreign production function is the same, except with a different productivity parameter  $\mathrm{A^{*}}$ .

Rather than working with the production functions for the inputs in (4.8), it will be convenient to work with the dual unit-cost function:

$$
\mathrm {c} (\mathrm {w}, \mathrm {q}, \mathrm {r}, \mathrm {z}) = \mathrm {B} [ \mathrm {w a} _ {\mathrm {L}} (\mathrm {z}) + \mathrm {q a} _ {\mathrm {H}} (\mathrm {z}) ] ^ {\theta} \mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {1 - \theta}, \tag {4.9}
$$

where  $c(w, q, r, z)$  denotes the costs of producing one unit of  $x(z)$  in the home country, given the wage of unskilled labor  $w$ , the wage of skilled labor  $q$ , and the rental on capital  $r$ . The inputs can be produced in either country, and are then combined into the production of a final product. The production function for the final good is assumed to be a Cobb-Douglas function over all the inputs:

$$
\ln \mathrm {Y} = \int_ {0} ^ {1} \alpha (\mathrm {z}) \ln \mathrm {x} (\mathrm {z}) \mathrm {d z}, \quad \text {w i t h} \quad \int_ {0} ^ {1} \alpha (\mathrm {z}) \mathrm {d z} = 1. \tag {4.10}
$$

Notice that in (4.10) we have not included labor as an input, so the final good is assembled "costlessly" from all the individual inputs  $z \in [0,1]$ . This means that we do not need to keep track of which country the assembly takes place, because there is zero value-added (and zero demand for labor) in this activity.

In general, firms doing the assembly will wish to source the inputs from the minimum cost location. To determine this, we will make the following assumption on factor prices:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {q}}{\mathrm {w}} <   \frac {\mathrm {q} ^ {*}}{\mathrm {w} ^ {*}}, \quad \text {a n d} \quad \mathrm {r} <   \mathrm {r} ^ {*} \quad . \tag {4.11}
$$

The first assumption in (4.11) states that the relative wage of skilled labor is lower at home than abroad, which is realistic if the home country is skilled-labor abundant, like the U.S.: despite the increase in the relative wage of skilled labor in the United States during the past two decades, it is still much lower than in Mexico. The second assumption states that the rental on capital is lower at home, so that if capital is able to move, it will want to re-locate abroad. This is also realistic if the home country is capital abundant, and will provide the basis for some comparative statics we shall consider.

With assumption (4.11), we can graphically illustrate the problem of choosing the minimum cost location for each input. Let us begin by graphing the unit-costs (4.9) for the home country, given fixed factor prices. The unit-costs  $c(w,q,r,z)$  as a function of  $z$  can have any shape whatsoever, and need not even be a continuous function. For convenience, however, we will assume that it is continuous, and illustrate this function as the upward-sloping curve CC in

Figure 4.5. Then the question is: how does the locus of unit-costs  $c^*(w^*, q^*, r^*, z)$  abroad, which we denote by  $C^*C^*$  related to that at home?

If the unit-costs of all activities were lower at home, for example, then all inputs would be produced there, and vice-versa if all unit-costs are lower abroad. We are interested in the case where there is some "production sharing" across the countries, so assume that the curves  $\mathrm{C}^*\mathrm{C}^*$  and CC intersect at least once, and denote this input by  $z^{*}$ , with  $c(\mathrm{w},\mathrm{q},\mathrm{r},\mathrm{z}^{*}) = c(\mathrm{w}^{*},\mathrm{q}^{*},\mathrm{r}^{*},\mathrm{z}^{*})$ . Then consider an activity  $z^{\prime} > z^{*}$  with slightly higher skilled/unskilled labor requirements. Because of our assumptions that  $(\mathrm{q / w}) < (\mathrm{q}^{*} / \mathrm{w}^{*})$ , the higher skilled/unskilled requirements should have a greater impact on foreign costs than on home costs. We therefore expect that  $c(\mathrm{w},\mathrm{r},\mathrm{q},\mathrm{z}^{\prime}) < c(\mathrm{w}^{*},\mathrm{q}^{*},\mathrm{r}^{*},\mathrm{z}^{\prime})$  for  $z^{\prime} > z^{*}$ . Similarly, we expect that the converse is also true,  $c(\mathrm{w},\mathrm{q},\mathrm{r},\mathrm{z}^{\prime}) > c(\mathrm{w}^{*},\mathrm{q}^{*},\mathrm{r}^{*},\mathrm{z}^{\prime})$  for  $z^{\prime} < z^{*}$ . Thus, the loci  $\mathrm{C}^*\mathrm{C}^*$  and CC can intersect at most once, as shown in Figure 4.5. $^{11}$  The similarity of this analysis with the model of Dornbusch, Fisher and Samuelson (1980) in the previous chapter will be clear to the reader, where we used nearly the same diagrams.

Given this unique intersection, we see that foreign unit-costs are less than those at home for all  $z' < z^*$ , so that the foreign country will specialize in the products  $[0, z^*)$ , whereas home unit-costs are less than those abroad for all  $z' > z^*$ , so the home country will specialize in  $(z^*, 1]$ . Using this information, we can then calculate the demand for labor in each country. At home, for example, the relative demand for skilled/unskilled labor is:

$$
D (z ^ {*}) = \frac {\int_ {z ^ {*}} ^ {1} \frac {\partial c}{\partial q} x (z) d z}{\int_ {z ^ {*}} ^ {1} \frac {\partial c}{\partial w} x (z) d z}. \tag {4.12}
$$

Figure 4.6

Because the final good is "costlessly" assembled from the intermediate inputs, without the use of any additional labor, we do not need to keep track of where this assembly occurs. A similar expression to (4.12) holds for the relative demand  $\mathrm{D}^{*}(\mathrm{z}^{*})$  in the foreign country, except that the integration is done over the range of goods [0,  $\mathbf{z}^*$ ] rather than  $(\mathbf{z}^*, 1]$ . Notice that the demands certainly depend on factor prices (since these enter the cost functions), and it can be confirmed that  $\mathrm{D}(\mathrm{z}^{*})$  and  $\mathrm{D}^{*}(\mathrm{z}^{*})$  are decreasing in the relative wage of skilled/unskilled labor in each country, as shown in Figure 4.6.

The equilibrium conditions for the world economy are that supply equal demand in the market for skilled and unskilled labor in each country, as well as for capital, when each country is producing the range of products for which they have minimum cost. In terms of our diagrams, we will have  $z^*$  determined by Figure 4.5, which is then used to draw the relative demand for labor in each country. Supposing the endowments of labor and capital are fixed, the relative wage is determined by the intersection of supply and demand in Figure 4.6 for each country, which feeds back into the cost loci CC and  $C^*C^*$  in Figure 4.6, to determine  $z^*$ . When all these curves intersect simultaneously, we can do a final calculation to determine the rental on capital in each country. The wage bill at home is  $wL + qH$ . Because wages make up the fraction  $\theta$  of total costs, it follows that GDP in each country is  $(wL + qH)/\theta$ . Multiplying this by (1-θ), the cost share of capital, we therefore obtain:

$$
\frac {(\mathrm {w L} + \mathrm {q H})}{\theta} (1 - \theta) = \mathrm {r K}. \tag {4.13}
$$

With the capital endowment  $\mathrm{K}$  fixed on the right of (4.13), this equation determines the rental rate at home, with the analogous equation holding abroad.

Now suppose that we allow capital to move between the countries. In particular, with our earlier assumption that  $\mathrm{r} < \mathrm{r}^*$ , suppose that some capital move from the home to the foreign country, so that  $\mathrm{K}$  falls while  $\mathrm{K}^*$  rises. From (4.13) and the analogous equation abroad, the initial impact of that capital movement will be to raise  $\mathrm{r}$  and lower  $\mathrm{r}^*$ . Of course, we expect a further effect on the wages appearing on the left of (4.13). To work out how these will change, consider Figures 4.7 and 4.8. The increase in  $\mathrm{r}$  raises the CC locus in Figure 4.7, while the reduction in  $\mathrm{r}^*$  lowers the  $\mathrm{C}^*\mathrm{C}^*$  locus. At unchanged wages, this has the effect of increasing the equilibrium value of  $\mathrm{z}$ , from  $\mathrm{z}^*$  to  $\mathrm{z}'$ . Therefore, the foreign country now specializes in the expanded range of activities  $[0, \mathrm{z}')$ , while the home country specializes in the contracted range of activities  $(\mathrm{z}', 1]$ . This will have an effect on the relative demand for labor in each country, as follows.

For the home country, the range of inputs being produced has contracted from  $(\mathbf{z}^{*}, 1]$  to  $(\mathbf{z}^{\prime}, 1]$ . Notice that those activities that have been transferred abroad, in the interval  $(\mathbf{z}^{*}, \mathbf{z}^{\prime})$ , are less skill-intensive than the activities still performed at home. This makes sense, since we expect the least-skilled intensive activities to be outsourced from the home country, such as the United States. This has the effect of lowering the relative demand for unskilled labor at home, or increasing the relative demand for skilled labor, so the curve  $\mathrm{D}(\mathbf{z}^{*})$  shifts rightward to  $\mathrm{D}(\mathbf{z}^{\prime})$  in Figure 4.8. What about the foreign country? Notice that in that country, the activities  $(\mathbf{z}^{*}, \mathbf{z}^{\prime})$  being added are more skill intensive than any activities previously done there. For example, as TV production shifted into Mexico, first the chassis of the televisions were constructed there, then the electronic circuits, and later still the picture tubes (Kenney and Florida, 1994). This shift in production has the effect of increasing the relative demand for skilled labor in the foreign country as well.

Figure 4.8

The rightward shift of the relative demand for skilled labor in both countries means that the relative wage of skilled labor rises in both countries. Of course, this change in wages has a feedback effect on the cost loci in Figure 4.7, which further changes the equilibrium value of  $z$ . In the final equilibrium, however, the changes are exactly as we have described: as more activities are outsourced, the relative demand for skilled labor rises in both countries. This is a realistic description of what has occurred in the U.S. as well as in Mexico (Cragg and Epelbaum, 1996; Hanson and Harrison, 1999; Robertson, 2000). In contrast, it is difficult to generate the same direction of movements in relative wages across countries from the Heckscher-Ohlin model, as we have found in the outsourcing model.

Can we say anything about absolute rather than relative wages? Feenstra and Hanson (1996) explore this, and conclude that while the relative wage of unskilled workers fall in both countries, their real wages need not fall. Unskilled workers in the home country are the most disadvantaged by the outsourcing, but nevertheless, it is possible that they gain due to lower prices of the final good. These results hold regardless of whether the increased outsourcing is due to a capital flow, as we have described, or due to a variety of other causes: growth in the capital endowments abroad, at a rate exceeding that at home; or simply technological progress abroad exceeding that at home. In each of these cases, the comparative static effects are the same as we have just described.

Another question, not explored by Feenstra and Hanson, is the extent to which factor accumulation or a reduction in trade barriers increases trade between countries. With trade due to outsourcing, it would appear that modest shifts in the relative cost loci in Figure 4.7 could potentially lead to large changes in the borderline activity  $z^{*}$  and in the amount of outsourcing. Yi (2002) argues that this is indeed the case in a Ricardian model with a continuum of goods,

and that “vertical specialization” accounts for more than  $50\%$  of the growth in U.S. trade since 1962. This paper is recommended for further reading.

# Estimating the Relative Demand for Skilled Labor

Summarizing our argument so far, the decision of companies to purchase intermediate inputs from overseas will most certainly affect their employment at home, and can be expected to differentially affect skilled versus unskilled workers. With firms in industrial countries facing a higher relative wage for unskilled labor than that found abroad, the activities that are outsourced would be those that use a large amount of unskilled labor, such as assembly of components and other repetitive tasks. Moving these activities overseas will reduce the relative demand for unskilled labor in the industrial country, in much the same way as replacing these workers with automated production. This means that outsourcing has a qualitatively similar effect on reducing the relative demand for unskilled labor within an industry as does skilled-biased technological change, such as the increased use of computers. Thus, determining which of these is most important is an empirical question.

We will examine two methods that have been used to estimate the effects of trade versus technological change on wages and employment. The first method estimates the demand for skilled and unskilled labor. Let us return to the simple three-good, three-factor model introduced above, where we derived the revenue function  $\mathrm{G_n(L_n,H_n,K_n,p_n,p)}$  in (4.4) for each industry  $n = 1,\dots,N$ , where  $p = (p_1,p_2)$  is the vector of imported input prices. It will be convenient to work with a "short-run" cost function that is dual to (4.4). Note that the function  $\mathrm{G_n(L_n,H_n,K_n,p_n,p)}$  is linearly homogeneous in prices, so we can alternatively write it as  $\mathrm{p_nG_n(L_n,H_n,K_n,1,p / p_n)}$ . Thus, a natural measure of real value-added is,

$$
\mathrm {Y} _ {\mathrm {n}} = \mathrm {G} _ {\mathrm {n}} \left(\mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {H} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {n}}, 1, \mathrm {p} / \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {n}}\right). \tag {4.14}
$$

This measure of output is nearly the same as  $y_{n}$ , except it now includes real net exports.

Provided that the underlying production functions  $\mathrm{f_i}$ ,  $\mathrm{i = 1,2,n}$ , are increasing and concave, then the function  $\mathbf{G}_{\mathrm{n}}$  will also be increasing and concave in  $(\mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{n}},\mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{n}},\mathbf{K}_{\mathrm{n}})$ .

Then the short-run cost function, obtained when the level of capital and output are fixed, is defined as:

$$
C _ {n} (w, q, K _ {n}, Y _ {n}, p / p _ {n}) \equiv \min  _ {L _ {n}, H _ {n}} w L _ {n} + q H _ {n}, \text {s u b j e c t} \tag {4.15}
$$

Notice that we have included the relative price of traded inputs  $\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{n}}$  in this cost function since they also appear in the revenue function (4.14). More generally, any structural variables that shift the production function and therefore affect costs should be included as arguments. In the model discussed above with a continuum of input, the range of inputs imported into each country should appear as an argument in (4.15). That is, it is not enough to just keep track of import prices – we also need to keep track of newly imported intermediate inputs. In practice, we will measure this by the expenditure on imported inputs for each industry, though this does not fully capture the idea of newly imported inputs.[13] We will denote all such variables that affect costs in industry  $\mathfrak{n}$  by the vector  $\mathbf{z}_{\mathrm{n}}$ ; in addition to imported inputs, this can include expenditures on computers and other new types of capital equipment. We therefore rewrite the cost function in (4.15) as  $C_{\mathrm{n}}(\mathrm{w},\mathrm{q},\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{n}},\mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{n}},\mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{n}})$ .

The next step is to choose a functional form for costs. As in our discussion of the GDP function in chapter 3, a convenient choice is the translog cost function, which is written in a general notation (dropping the industry subscript n) as,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \ln C = \alpha_ {0} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \ln w _ {\mathrm {i}} + \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {K}} \beta_ {\mathrm {k}} \ln x _ {\mathrm {k}} + \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \gamma_ {\mathrm {i j}} \ln w _ {\mathrm {i}} \ln w _ {\mathrm {j}} \tag {4.16} \\ + \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {K}} \sum_ {\ell = 1} ^ {\mathrm {K}} \delta_ {\mathrm {k} \ell} \ln \mathrm {x} _ {\mathrm {k}} \ln \mathrm {x} _ {\ell} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {K}} \phi_ {\mathrm {i k}} \ln \mathrm {w} _ {\mathrm {i}} \ln \mathrm {x} _ {\mathrm {k}} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathrm{w_i}$  denotes the wages of the optimally chosen inputs  $\mathrm{i} = 1, \dots, \mathrm{M}$ , and  $\mathrm{x_k}$  denotes either the quantities of the fixed inputs or outputs  $\mathrm{k} = 1, \dots, \mathrm{K}$ , or any other shift parameters. In terms of the cost function in (4.15), there are just two optimally chosen factors – skilled and unskilled labor – while capital and output are treated as fixed in the short run.

The usefulness of the translog function comes from computing its first derivatives,  $\partial \ln C / \partial \ln w_{i} = (\partial C / \partial w_{i})(w_{i} / C)$ . Because  $\partial C / \partial w_{i}$  equals the demand for the chosen input  $i$ , it follows that  $(\partial C / \partial w_{i})(w_{i} / C)$  equals the payments to factor  $i$  relative to total costs, which we denote by the cost-shares  $s_i$ . Thus, differentiating (4.16) with respect to  $\ln w_{i}$ , we obtain,

$$
s _ {i} = \alpha_ {i} + \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {M} \gamma_ {i j} \ln w _ {j} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \phi_ {i k} \ln x _ {k}, \quad i = 1, \dots , M. \tag {4.17}
$$

Given annual data on factor cost shares, wages, and fixed inputs and outputs, this set of linear equations can be estimated over time for a given industry to obtain the coefficients  $\gamma_{\mathrm{ij}}$  and  $\phi_{\mathrm{ik}}$ .

Alternatively, the equations can be estimated for a single year, or the change between two years, by pooling data across industries. In the latter case, we are assuming that the same cost function applies across the industries. Despite this strong assumption, the cross-industry approach is popular and we will follow it here.

Returning now to the notation  $C_n(w, q, K_n, Y_n, z_n)$  as in (4.15), we have two chosen inputs - skilled and unskilled labor. Focusing on the share equation for skilled labor, it will depend on wages for both types of labor, as well capital, output, and all other structural variables,  $z_n$ . When (4.17) is estimated by pooling data across industries, as in Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994) for example, it is felt the cross-industry variation in wages has little information: wages differ across industries principally due to quality-variation of workers, so we do not expect high-wage industries to economize on those (high-quality) workers. Accordingly, the wage terms are typically dropped from the right of (4.17) when pooling data across industries. This leaves just fixed capital, output, and other structural variables. Taking the difference between two years, the estimating equation for the wage-share of skilled labor ( $s_{nH}$ ) in industries  $n = 1, \ldots, N$  becomes:

$$
\Delta \mathrm {s} _ {\mathrm {n H}} = \phi_ {0} + \phi_ {\mathrm {K}} \Delta \ln \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {n}} + \phi_ {\mathrm {Y}} \Delta \ln \mathrm {Y} _ {\mathrm {n}} + \phi_ {\mathrm {z}} ^ {\prime} \Delta \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \quad \mathrm {n} = 1, \dots , \mathrm {N}, \tag {4.18}
$$

where  $z_{n}$  denotes the vector of structural variables that shifts costs, and  $\phi_{z}$  is the corresponding vector of coefficients. In particular, when the wage-share of skilled labor is increasing, we are interested in determining how much of that increase is due to changes in capital, output, and the structural variables.

Estimates of (4.18) for 447 industries within the U.S. manufacturing sector, over 1979-1990, are shown in Table 4.4. The data are from the NBER Productivity Database (Bartelsman

Note: The mean of the dependent variable equals 0.389. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust to heteroskedasticity and correlation in the errors within two-digit industries. The first column shows mean values of the dependent and independent variables for 1979-1990. All regressions and means are computed over 447 four-digit SIC industries and are weighted by the average industry share of the manufacturing wage bill.  $\Delta \ln (\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Y})$  is the average annual change in the log capital-shipments ratio and  $\Delta \ln (\mathrm{Y})$  is the average annual change in log real shipments. The outsourcing variables and the computer and high-technology shares are in annual changes.
Source: Feenstra and Hanson (2003, Table 3), as simplified from Feenstra and Hanson (1999, Table III), and empirical exercise 4.2.

and Gray, 1996, which is available at http://www.nber.org/nberces/). In these regressions we use nonproduction labor as a proxy for skilled labor, so the dependent variable is the change in the share of nonproduction labor in total wages within each industry. Over all manufacturing industries, the nonproduction wage share increased from  $35.4\%$  to  $42.4\%$  between 1979 and 1990, for an annual growth of  $0.4\%$  (four-tenths of one percent) per year. It is common to weight regressions like those in Table 4.4 by the industry share of the total manufacturing wage bill, as we shall do. In this way, large industries receive more weight in the regressions. The regressors included are: the shipments of each industry (as a proxy for real value-added  $\mathrm{Y_n}$ ); the capital/shipments ratio (reflecting the capital input  $\mathrm{K_n}$  relative to  $\mathrm{Y_n}$ ); outsourcing, measured by imported intermediate inputs as a share of total intermediate purchases (one of the  $\mathrm{z_n}$  variables); and the share of computers and other high-tech capital in the capital stock (other  $\mathrm{z_n}$  variables). Several of these variables deserve further explanation.

The imported intermediate inputs have been estimated by Feenstra and Hanson (1999) using the input-output matrix of the U.S. economy, combined with trade data. For example, if the automobile industry purchases  $10\%$  of its inputs from the steel industry, and  $30\%$  of steel consumed in the U.S. is imported, then we conclude that  $3\%$  of the inputs in autos is due to imported steel. This is summed over all intermediate inputs to arrive at the overall share of imported inputs for each industry. The share of computers and other high-tech capital in the capital stock is constructed in three different ways: first, using ex post rental prices to measure capital services; second, using ex ante rental prices to measure capital services;[17] and third, by

measuring computer expenditures as a share of investment rather than of the capital stock. $^{18}$  We think that it is preferable to measure the contribution of computers to the capital stock, rather than to new investment, but experiment with all three approaches.

In column (1) of Table 4.4, we report the mean values of the dependent and independent variables for 1979-1990, and, following this, the regression coefficients in columns (2)-(4). Each regression uses alternative measures of the computer and other high-technology shares. In all the regressions, we see that outsourcing has a positive impact on the nonproduction share of the wage bill, as does the computer share. By multiplying the regression coefficients by the mean values for the change in each variable, we obtain the contributions of each to the total change in the nonproduction wage share, shown in column (5). We see that outsourcing accounts for  $15\% - 24\%$  of the shift towards nonproduction labor.

The results for computers depend on the specification. Measuring computer services and other high-tech capital as a share of the capital stock using ex post rental prices, we see they account for  $13\%$  of the shift towards nonproduction labor. Measuring these shares using ex ante rental prices, we see that that computers and other high-tech capital explain only  $8\%$  of this shift.

payments to capital are constructed as a residual,  $\mathrm{rK_n = pY_n - wL_n}$ . Next, we need some measure of the physical capital stock  $\mathbf{K}_{\mathrm{n}}$ , which is typically constructed from investment data  $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{n}}$  using the perpetual inventory method:  $\mathrm{K_{nt} = (1 - \delta)K_{nt - 1} + I_{nt}}$ , where  $\delta$  is a depreciation rate for capital. Then using the constructed physical capital in year t, and the total payments to capital in year t, these are divided to obtain the ex post rental on capital in year t:  $\mathrm{r_t = (pY_{nt} - wL_{nt}) / K_{nt}}$ . Then using the purchase price of capital  $\mathrm{p_{kt}}$ , the implied ex post rate of return to capital would be constructed as  $\rho_{t} = (\mathrm{r}_{t} / \mathrm{p}_{kt}) - \delta +[(\mathrm{p}_{kt + 1} - \mathrm{p}_{kt}) / \mathrm{p}_{kt}]$ . Thus, the ex post rate of return includes the rental relative to the purchase price, minus depreciation, plus any capital gains or losses on the capital equipment. In contrast, an ex ante rate of return would ignore the capital gains or losses. Thus, if we chose  $\rho^{*}$  as a "safe" rate of return such as on a bond, then the corresponding ex ante rental price would be obtained by ignoring capital gains and computing  $\mathrm{r_t}$  from the equation,  $\mathrm{r_t = (\rho^* + \delta)p_{kt}}$ . The formulas used for the rental prices becomes more complicated when we take into account business taxes, and when there are multiple types of capital. For further details see Harper, Berndt and Wood (1989).
 The share of computer spending in investment is obtained from the Census of Manufactures, which simply asked firms to report what percentage of new investment was devoted to computers. This variable has been used previously by Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994) and Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998).

In both cases, the contribution of computers and other high-tech capital is less than the contribution of outsourcing. In contrast, when computers are measured by their share of investment (and the high-technology capital share is also included), we see that these variables account for  $31\%$  of the shift toward nonproduction labor, which exceeds the contribution of outsourcing. Thus, whether outsourcing is more or less important than computers depends on whether the latter are measured as a share of the capital stock, or as a share of investment. Regardless of the specification, however, it is fair to conclude that both outsourcing and expenditure on computers and other high technology capital are important explanations of the shift towards nonproduction labor in the U.S., with their exact magnitudes depending on how they are measured.

A specification like (4.18) has also been used to investigate the demand shift towards nonproduction labor in various other countries. Following its liberalization of foreign investment and trade in the 1980s, Mexico experienced an increase in the relative wage of skilled labor (Hanson and Harrison, 1999). In the period following reform, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico was concentrated in foreign assembly plants, known as maquiladoras, most of which are located in Mexican states along the U.S. border. These assembly plants are created, in most cases, by U.S. firms outsourcing unskilled-labor intensive production activities to Mexico. Feenstra and Hanson (1997) find that the shift in Mexican manufacturing towards foreign assembly plants over 1975-1988 can account for  $45\%$  of the increase in the country's nonproduction wage share. Evidence supporting the link between outsourcing or import penetration and wages shares or relative employment is also available for Austria (Dell'mour et al, 2000), Germany (Geishecker, 2002), Hong Kong (Hsieh and Woo, 1999), Japan (Head and Ries, 2002) and the U.K. (Anderton and Brenton, 1999; and Gorg, et al 2001).

In the specification (4.18), outsourcing changes the relative wage by shifting out the relative demand for skilled labor. An alternative view is that international trade changes factor prices by flattening the labor demand curves, making them more elastic. Leamer (1998) presents an extreme version of this story, in which the transition of an economy from autarky to trade transforms an economy's labor demand curve from being downward sloping to being horizontal, at least over segments that correspond to diversified production.[19] Extending this logic, Rodrik (1997) identifies several mechanisms through which greater economic integration between countries may make labor demand curves flatter. In one of the few attempts to test this hypothesis, Slaughter (2001) estimates the own-price elasticity of labor demand for production and nonproduction workers in two-digit U.S. manufacturing industries over the period 1960-1991. Over the entire sample, demand became more elastic for production labor, but not for nonproduction labor. The sectors with the largest increase in elasticities were food and tobacco, apparel and textiles, wood and paper, and primary and fabricated metals, which include some of the least-skill intensive manufacturing industries. The demand for production labor became more elastic in industries with more outsourcing, more investment in computers, and more investment in high-tech capital overall. These results are robust to controls for industry fixed effects but not time fixed effects, suggesting that changes in labor-demand elasticities are dominated by a time trend.

# Estimating the Zero Profit Conditions

The second empirical technique we will discuss assumes that both types of labor, as well as capital, are being optimally chosen. So we abandon the "short run" cost function in (4.15), and instead use the more familiar long-run cost function for the industry:

$$
\mathrm {C} _ {\mathrm {n}} \left(\mathrm {w} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {Y} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {p} / \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {n}}\right) \equiv \min  _ {\mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {H} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {n}}} \mathrm {w} _ {\mathrm {n}} \mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {n}} + \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {n}} \mathrm {H} _ {\mathrm {n}} + \mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {n}} \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \text {s u b j e c t t o (4 . 1 4)}. \tag {4.19}
$$

Notice that in (4.19) we have allowed the factor prices  $\mathrm{w_n}$ ,  $\mathrm{q_n}$ , and  $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{n}}$  to differ across the

industries  $n = 1, \dots, N$ . This reflects the empirical fact that factor prices, and wages in particular,

do differ across industries (Krueger and Summers, 1988), and will turn out to be important. As

before, the relative price of traded inputs  $\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{n}}$  enters this cost function because it also appears in

the revenue function (4.14); we will replace this by the vector  $\mathbf{z}_{\mathrm{n}}$ , which includes other structural

variables.

Since the revenue function (4.14) is linearly homogeneous in inputs, then we can rewrite

the cost function in (4.19) as,

$$
\mathrm {C} _ {\mathrm {n}} \left(\mathrm {w} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {Y} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {n}}\right) = \mathrm {Y} _ {\mathrm {n}} \mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {n}} \left(\mathrm {w} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {n}}\right), \tag {4.20}
$$

where  $c_{n}(w_{n}, q_{n}, r_{n}, z_{n})$  denotes the unit-cost function. The zero-profit conditions in the industries

are therefore expressed as,

$$
p _ {n} = c _ {n} \left(w _ {n}, q _ {n}, r _ {n}, z _ {n}\right), \quad n = 1, \dots , N. \tag {4.21}
$$

Throughout this book, we have examined how changes in product prices affect factor

prices. Now, however, the presence of the structural variables  $\mathbf{z}_{\mathrm{n}}$  means that the changes in

prices reflect more than just changes in factor prices. Indeed, taking the difference between the

log change in factor and product prices, we can define total factor productivity as,

$$
\mathrm {T F P} _ {\mathrm {n}} \equiv \left(\theta_ {\mathrm {n L}} \Delta \ln \mathrm {w} _ {\mathrm {n}} + \theta_ {\mathrm {n H}} \Delta \ln \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {n}} + \theta_ {\mathrm {n K}} \Delta \ln \mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {n}}\right) - \Delta \ln \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {n}}, \tag {4.22}
$$

where the cost-shares of the three factors sum to unity,  $\theta_{\mathrm{nL}} + \theta_{\mathrm{nH}} + \theta_{\mathrm{nK}} = 1$ , and  $\Delta$  denotes the

first-difference. Productivity improvements mean that factor prices rise more than product

prices, so that (4.22) is positive. Note that this is the "dual" definition of productivity, and empirically it is very close to the "primal" definition, which is the growth in output minus the weighted average of the growth in inputs.[20]

Shuffling the terms in (4.22) slightly, we obtain the equation,

$$
\Delta \ln p _ {n} = - T F P _ {n} + \theta_ {n L} \Delta \ln w _ {n} + \theta_ {n H} \Delta \ln q _ {n} + \theta_ {n K} \Delta \ln r _ {n}, n = 1, \dots , N. \tag {4.23}
$$

We consider estimating (4.23) as a linear regression across industries, where the data are the change in log prices, total factor productivity, and the factor cost-shares  $\theta_{\mathrm{nj}}$ , while the change in factor-prices are estimated as regression coefficients. That is, we estimate the implied change in factor-prices  $\beta_{\mathrm{L}}, \beta_{\mathrm{H}}$ , and  $\beta_{\mathrm{K}}$  from the regression:

$$
\Delta \ln p _ {n} = - T F P _ {n} + \theta_ {n L} \beta_ {L} + \theta_ {n H} \beta_ {H} + \theta_ {n K} \beta_ {K} + \varepsilon_ {n}, n = 1, \dots , N, \tag {4.24}
$$

where  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{n}}$  is an error term, specified more fully below. We interpret the coefficients  $\beta_{\mathrm{L}}, \beta_{\mathrm{H}}$ , and  $\beta_{\mathrm{K}}$  as the change in factor prices that are "mandated by" the change in product prices, which is the dependent variable in (4.24). We hope to find that the estimate factor prices changes  $\beta_{\mathrm{L}}, \beta_{\mathrm{H}}$ , and  $\beta_{\mathrm{K}}$  from this regression are quite close to their actual changes, and if so, we can conclude that a Stolper-Samuelson linkage between product and factor prices works empirically. Baldwin and Hilton (1984) were among the first to estimate this price regression, and there are many recent applications of it (Baldwin and Cain, 2000, Slaughter, 2000), as discussed below.

Estimates of (4.24) for 447 U.S. manufacturing industries, over 1979-1990, are provided in Table 4.5. The dependent variable is the log change in the industry output price over the period, and we use the primal measure of TFP. The other independent variables are the average cost-shares for production labor, nonproduction labor, and capital; the materials cost share times the log change in materials prices; and the energy cost share times the log change in energy prices. Note that we do not attempt to estimate the change in materials prices and energy prices, but simply include these cost shares times their prices as controls.

In columns (1) and (2), we constrain the coefficients on the materials share times the materials price, and the energy share times the energy price, to be unity. This approximates the specification in Leamer (1998). In column (1), the coefficients on the labor shares imply a decrease in the nonproduction/production relative wage of  $2.3\% - 3.1\% = -0.8\%$  per year, which is consistent with the results in Leamer (1998). But in reality, the nonproduction-production wage gap in the U.S. rose by  $0.7\%$  per year, or about seven-tenths of one percent.[21] So the regression in column (1) does not reproduce at all the actual factor prices changes in the United States! In column (2), we follow Sachs and Shatz (1994) and drop the computer industry (SIC 3573), which reverses the predicted change in wage inequality. Now, nonproduction wages are mandated to rise by  $1.5\%$  per year more than production wages. In column (3), we approximate Krueger's (1997) specification by dropping TFP as a regressor, while estimating coefficients on materials and energy. There is again a mandated rise in the nonproduction-production wage gap, but one that is much larger than the actual increase in relative wages.

Note: Standard errors are in parentheses. All regressions omit three industries with missing data on materials purchases or prices (SIC 2067, 2794, 3483) and are weighted by the industry share of total manufacturing shipments, averaged over the first and last period.

In columns (1)-(3) and (5), the dependent variable is the log change in the gross industry price, and the factor cost shares sum to one across all factors. The materials cost share is multiplied by the log change in the materials price; the energy cost share is treated similarly. In column (4), the dependent variable is the log change in the industry value-added price and factor cost shares sum to one across primary factors. Column (1) uses primal TFP as a regressor; column (2) drops the computer industry (SIC 3573) from the sample; column (3) also drops TFP as a regressor; and column (5) uses effective TFP as a regressor, where effective TFP equals primal TFP minus the change in wage differentials.

The estimates in Table 4.5 are troubling because they show that slight changes in the data, such as dropping the computer industry, have dramatic effects on the results. While it is true that the computer industry is an outlier, the sensitivity of the results to the specification suggests that something more basic is going on. To address this, let us ask: why do the estimates of  $\beta_{\mathrm{L}}$ ,  $\beta_{\mathrm{H}}$ , and  $\beta_{\mathrm{K}}$  from regression (4.24) differ at all from the actual average change in manufacturing wages, which we denote by  $\overline{\Delta \ln w}$ ,  $\overline{\Delta \ln q}$ , and  $\overline{\Delta \ln r}$ ? The overbar indicates that we are averaging the change in factor-price over all manufacturing industries. By just comparing (4.23) and (4.24), it seems that there should be some close connection between the estimates  $\beta_{\mathrm{L}}$ ,  $\beta_{\mathrm{H}}$ , and  $\beta_{\mathrm{K}}$  and these average actual factor price changes, but we need to uncover what this connection is.

To achieve this, let us make the transition from (4.23) to an estimating equation more carefully. First, notice that we can rewrite (4.23) as,

$$
\Delta \ln p _ {n} = - T F P _ {n} + \theta_ {n L} \overline {{\Delta \ln w}} + \theta_ {n H} \overline {{\Delta \ln q}} + \theta_ {n K} \overline {{\Delta \ln r}} + \varepsilon_ {n}, \tag {4.25}
$$

where,

$$
\varepsilon_ {\mathrm {n}} \equiv \theta_ {\mathrm {n L}} \left(\Delta \ln \mathrm {w} _ {\mathrm {n}} - \overline {{\Delta \ln \mathrm {w}}}\right) + \theta_ {\mathrm {n H}} \left(\Delta \ln \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {n}} - \overline {{\Delta \ln \mathrm {q}}}\right) + \theta_ {\mathrm {n K}} \left(\Delta \ln \mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {n}} - \overline {{\Delta \ln \mathrm {r}}}\right). \tag {4.26}
$$

That is, we replace the industry wage changes on the right of (4.23) by the average wage changes, and incorporate the difference between these two into an error term. In economic terms,  $\varepsilon_{n}$  reflects interindustry wage differentials: i.e., the difference between wages paid in each industry and the manufacturing average. It is well known that these wage differentials vary systematically across industries, with capital-intensive industries paying higher wages.

Now that we have derived the regression equation more carefully, it is clear that it has an error term  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{n}}$ . Recognizing this, we can answer the question of whether the estimates from the

equation will match the actual factor price changes or not: the estimates of  $\beta_{\mathrm{L}}, \beta_{\mathrm{H}}$ , and  $\beta_{\mathrm{K}}$  obtained from (4.24) will be unbiased estimates of the average actual factor price changes in (4.25) if and only if the error term  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{n}}$  shown in (4.26) is uncorrelated with the cost-shares  $\theta_{\mathrm{nL}}$ ,  $\theta_{\mathrm{nH}}$ , and  $\theta_{\mathrm{nK}}$ . This result follows directly from the properties of ordinary least squares, whereby the independent variables need to be uncorrelated with the error term to obtain unbiased estimates. But this property is unlikely to be true in our data. Industries such as computers have both a high share of nonproduction labor (e.g., engineers), and probably the fastest growing industry wage differential, as these workers have had very rapid wage gains. This suggests that the error term  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{n}}$  is negative for computers, resulting in a negative correlation with the nonproduction labor cost-share. Indeed, this negative correlation likely explains why the estimated change in nonproduction wages is lower in column (1) of Table 4.5, which includes the computer industry, than in columns (2) or (3), which exclude this industry.

To correct this problem, we can simply include the error term  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{n}}$  as an additional regressor in the equation, reflecting the change in interindustry wage differentials. It is convenient to combine  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{n}}$  with  $\mathrm{TFP}_{\mathrm{n}}$ , obtaining a measure of "effective" TFP:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {E T F P} _ {\mathrm {n}} \equiv \mathrm {T F P} _ {\mathrm {n}} - \varepsilon_ {\mathrm {n}} \\ = \left(\theta_ {\mathrm {n L}} \overline {{\Delta \ln \mathrm {w}}} + \theta_ {\mathrm {n H}} \overline {{\Delta \ln \mathrm {q}}} + \theta_ {\mathrm {n K}} \overline {{\Delta \ln \mathrm {r}}}\right) - \Delta \ln \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {n}}. \tag {4.27} \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, this measure of effective productivity shows how the average manufacturing factor-price changes, weighted using the cost-share in each industry, differ from the change in product price of that industry. Making use of (4.27), the regression in (4.24) is written once again as,

$$
\Delta \ln p _ {n} = - E T F P _ {n} + \theta_ {n L} \beta_ {L} + \theta_ {n H} \beta_ {H} + \theta_ {n K} \beta_ {K}, \quad n = 1, \dots , N. \tag {4.28}
$$

Now, there is no error term at all in this regression, so it ought to provide a perfect fit when estimated. This will not be exactly true in our data, since we are using the primal rather than the dual measure of TFP to construct effective TFP in (4.28). These priors are confirmed in columns (4) and (5) of Table 4.5. In column (4), we constrain the coefficients on the materials and energy shares to equal unity, while in column (5), we allow these coefficients to differ from unity. In either specification, the coefficients on the labor and capital shares are extremely close to the actual average annual percentage changes in factor prices, which are  $4.7\%$  for production labor,  $5.4\%$  for nonproduction labor, and  $4.0\%$  for capital. Thus, when we properly estimate (4.28), we end up with an identity!

Summarizing our results so far, we started with the goal of estimating the zero-profit conditions to obtain "mandated" changes in factor prices that are consistent with the change in product prices. A number of researchers have estimated an equation like (4.23), without much attention to the error term in this regression. When we carefully derive the error term, as in (4.26), we then realize that it is likely correlated with the factor cost-shares that are the independent variables. To correct for this we can include the error term as data, by incorporating it into "effective" total factor productivity. But now we encounter another problem: this gives essentially a perfect fit, just reproducing the actual change in factor prices. That means the regression does not provide us with any new information at all! This discouraging finding suggests that a new approach is needed.

To make further progress, Feenstra and Hanson (1999) propose a two-step estimation procedure. In the first step, we combine the variables  $\Delta \ln p_{n} + \mathrm{ETF}P_{n}$ , which appear in (4.28), and regress these on the structural variables  $z_{n}$ . Supposing that there are only two structural variables,  $z_{1n}$  and  $z_{2n}$ , we therefore run the regression:

$$
\Delta \ln p _ {n} + E T F P _ {n} = \alpha_ {0} + \alpha_ {1} \Delta z _ {1 n} + \alpha_ {2} \Delta z _ {2 n}, n = 1, \dots , N. \tag {4.29}
$$

In the second step, we then take the estimated coefficients  $\hat{\alpha}_{1}$  and  $\hat{\alpha}_{2}$ , and use these to construct the dependent variables for the regressions,

$$
\hat {\alpha} _ {1} \Delta z _ {1 n} = \theta_ {n L} \beta_ {1 L} + \theta_ {n H} \beta_ {1 H} + \theta_ {n K} \beta_ {1 K}, \quad \text {a n d ,} \tag {4.30a}
$$

$$
\hat {\alpha} _ {2} \Delta z _ {2 n} = \theta_ {n L} \beta_ {2 L} + \theta_ {n H} \beta_ {2 H} + \theta_ {n K} \beta_ {2 K}, n = 1, \dots , N. \tag {4.30b}
$$

That is, we use the estimated coefficients  $\hat{\alpha}_{1}$  and  $\hat{\alpha}_{2}$ , times each structural variable as the dependent variables in (4.30), and regress these on the factor cost-shares. The coefficients obtained from the second-stage regression,  $\beta_{1\mathrm{L}}, \beta_{1\mathrm{H}}, \beta_{1\mathrm{K}}$  and  $\beta_{2\mathrm{L}}, \beta_{2\mathrm{H}}, \beta_{2\mathrm{K}}$ , are interpreted as the portion of the total change in factor-prices that are explained by each structural variable. In this way, we are taking the total change in factor-prices, and decomposing it into parts that are explained by each structural variable.

In their estimation of (4.29) for U.S. manufacturing industries over the period 1979-1990, Feenstra and Hanson (1999) find positive and statistically significant correlations between dependent variable  $\Delta \ln p_{\mathrm{m}} + \mathrm{ETF}_{\mathrm{m}}$  in the first step regressions, and the structural variables: outsourcing, the computer share of the capital stock, and the computer share of investment. In the second step, these structural variables (times their estimated coefficients) are regressed on the factor-cost shares to obtain "mandated changes" in factor prices. The results indicate that both outsourcing and capital upgrading contributed to rising wage inequality in the 1980s.

For example, when the share of the capital stock devoted to computers is measured using ex post rental prices, then outsourcing accounts for  $15\%$  of the increase in the relative wage of nonproduction workers while computers account for  $35\%$  of this increase; thus, computers are

twice as important as outsourcing. When instead the computer share of the capital stock is measured using ex ante rental prices, then outsourcing explains about  $25\%$  while computers explain about  $20\%$  of the increase in the relative wage. However, when the computer share of investment is used, then the contribution of outsourcing falls to about  $10\%$ , while the contribution of computers rises so much that it explains the entire increase in the relative wage. So as with our results when examining the change in the nonproduction labor share, when we now consider the factors influencing the relative wage, we find that both outsourcing and computer expenditure are important, with their exact magnitudes depending on how these variables are measured.

Haskel and Slaughter (2001) have also applied the two-stage estimation procedure to data on U.K. manufacturing industries over the period 1960-1990. As structural variables they use union density (the share of union workers in industry employment), industry concentration (share of sales by the five largest firms), innovations per industry, import prices, and computerization (share of firms in the industry using computers). They find that TFP growth is higher in industries with more innovations, lower initial union density, lower initial sales concentration, and larger reductions in import prices (but is unrelated with computerization). Product price changes are lower in industries with smaller changes in import prices. During the 1980s, when U.K. wage inequality rose, the structural variable that appears to have contributed most to the increase in the skilled-unskilled wage gap is industry innovation. The contribution of import prices is comparatively small. This contrasts with research (Anderton and Brenton, 1999) showing that rising imports over 1970-83 is a significant determinant of the nonproduction labor share in the U.K.

# The Role of Nontraded Goods

Our approach above has been to use disaggregate data for U.S. manufacturing, most of which are traded goods. As appealing as this approach may be, it misses the important fact that most of the U.S. economy – as with other industrial countries – is devoted to nontraded goods and services. It is highly desirable, therefore, to incorporate the nontraded sector into the estimation. One way to do this is to estimate aggregate GDP or cost functions, distinguishing nontraded and traded goods, as well as different types of labor. This approach has been taken by several authors, as follows.

Tombazos (1999) distinguishes types of labor by identifying industries that are intensive in skilled or unskilled labor, and then forming aggregate wages and employment indexes over each group of industries; these indexes are then used as a proxy for the price and quantity of skilled and unskilled labor. He incorporates skilled labor, unskilled labor, capital and imports into the estimation of an aggregate cost function for the U.S., over 1967-1994, with a single aggregate output (including exports). His major conclusion is that a drop in the import price reduces the demand for unskilled labor, but raises the demand for skilled labor in the U.S. This is highly consistent with our theoretical model in this chapter. Missing from his analysis, though, is a discussion of how much import prices have fallen, and therefore, how much of the shift towards skilled labor can be explained by this channel of influence.

Further results are obtained by Harrigan and Balaban (1999), Harrigan (2000) and Kumar (2000). Harrigan and Balaban estimate a translog GDP function for the United States over the period 1963-1991 using data on four factors (high-school dropouts, high-school graduates, college graduates, and capital), and four sectors (skill-intensive traded goods, unskilled-intensive traded goods, skill-intensive nontraded goods, and unskilled-intensive nontraded goods). Thus,

imports are not explicitly identified. In contrast, Harrigan (2000) has two categories of outputs (skill-intensive and unskilled-intensive final output), and seven factors including imports (oil imports, two other groups of imports, and the three types of labor and capital). It turns out that changes in the import prices have been quite small in comparison with other price changes, especially in nontraded goods, so that changes in import prices are not an important explanation for changes in wages. We therefore focus below on the results of Harrigan and Balaban, which except for imports are similar to those of Harrigan.

With the estimated coefficients from the translog share equations, Harrigan and Balaban calculate wage elasticities with respect to factor quantities and product prices. They find that the elasticity of each factor price with respect to its own endowment is negative (so the hypothesis of "factor price insensitivity" is rejected). Increasing the supply of capital raise wages for all workers, but these elasticities are rising in education levels, such that a  $10\%$  increase in the capital stock increases the college/high-school-graduate relative wage by about  $3.5\%$ , and the college/high-school-dropout relative wage by about  $8\%$ . The wage elasticities of traded goods prices are imprecisely estimated, while those for nontraded goods are somewhat surprising. Increases in prices of skill-intensive nontraded goods raises wages for college graduates and high-school dropouts, but lowers wages for high-school graduates, whereas increases in prices of unskilled-intensive nontraded goods have a large positive effect on high-school-graduate wages, a moderate positive effect on college wages, and a negative effect on high-school-dropout wages.

Putting the estimated wage elasticities together with observed changes in factor supplies and product prices, we can decompose the contribution of different variables to the observed change in factor prices. While capital accumulation contributed to an increase in the relative wage of college graduates, this effect was largely offset by increases in the supply of college

graduates. The big changes during the latter part of the sample period were an increase in the relative price of skill-intensive nontraded goods, such as finance, insurance and real estate. This had the largest impact on raising the college/high-school-graduate relative wage. Conversely, there was a decrease in the relative price of unskilled-intensive nontraded goods, such as wholesale and retail trade, which had the largest impact on reducing the relative wage of high-school-dropouts. In short, the increase in the relative wage of skilled labor, in the 1980s and beyond, is highly correlated with the rise in the price of nontraded goods that use skilled labor, and similarly for unskilled labor where both the relative wage and nontraded price fell.

This is a surprising finding, since it seems to suggest that the wage changes have little to do with trade. But Harrigan and Balaban's findings beg the question of whether the change in nontraded prices is caused the change in wages, or conversely. Using the model of Sachs and Schatz (1998), it is not difficult to construct an example where capital leaves the country, increasing the relative wage of skilled labor, and therefore raising the price of skill-intensive nontradables and lowering the price of unskilled-intensive nontradables.[22] This story would be consistent with the estimates of Harrigan and Balaban, and supposes that the driving force behind the wage and price changes is international capital flows. We cannot rule out, however, the idea that the nontradables prices are changing due to some other reason (e.g. rising incomes and demand leading to an increase in the price of skill-intensive nontradables), which is therefore the proximate cause of the change in wages.[23] As Harrigan (2000, p. 186) puts it: "To my knowledge, there are no scholarly studies of relative price determination in the United States that might shed light on the causes of the changes shown...and until we understand the cause of these price changes we cannot rule out an important role for import competition."

# Conclusions

The model of intermediates inputs we have investigated has some similarities to the conventional Heckscher-Ohlin framework, but rather than focusing on industries of various skill-intensities, we instead suppose that there are activities within each industry that vary in their factor intensities. These activities are modeled as intermediate inputs that are traded between countries and combined into some final product. With this modification from the conventional Heckscher-Ohlin framework, we have found that we can easily generate shifts in relative demand for skilled labor within an industry. We have further argued that drop in the price of imported intermediates has effects that are observationally equivalent to the effect of skilled-biased technological change. The relative importance of trade versus technological change must be assessed on empirical grounds.

While models of production sharing are starting to take hold within international trade, this concept is already used in economic sociology (Gereffi and Korzeniewicz, 1994; Kenney and Florida, 1994), geography (Dicken et al, 2001; Yeung, 2001) and other social sciences, where production sharing is referred to by the more general name "commodity chains." A commodity chain consists of the sequence of activities involved in the manufacture of a product, from initial development through to production, marketing and sales, especially as these activities cross international boundaries. In these disciplines, commodity chains are seen as an integral part of the development process for countries that are still industrializing. We have taken a less grand view, and have simply argued that production sharing has a substantial impact on wages.

Using these theoretical insights, we described the labor demand regression arising from a model where capital is fixed in the short run, while skilled and unskilled labor are chosen optimally. Additional terms are included in the demand regressions reflecting trade in intermediate inputs (outsourcing) as well as computer use. We find that both of these explanations can explain a portion of the shift towards skilled labor in the U.S. during the 1980s, with the exact contribution of each being sensitive to how computer use is measured (i.e. as a share of the capital stock, or as a share of new investment).

We also re-visited the link between changes in product prices and factor prices. Contrary to the suggestion of Lawrence and Slaughter (1993), we argued that the movements in product prices (combined with growth in productivity) are fully consistent with the increase in the relative wage of skilled labor in the U.S. Indeed, the zero-profit conditions ensure that, as an identity, the change in relative wages must be explained by product prices and productivity. The challenge for researchers is to uncover what structural factors explain the underlying movement in prices and productivity: are these changes due to skill-biased technological upgrades, or due to trade in intermediate inputs? We discussed a "two stage" estimation procedure due to Feenstra and Hanson (1999) that allows this to be determined. As with the labor demand regressions, we find that both outsourcing and computer use can account for a portion of the increase in the relative wage of skilled workers, with the exact contribution of each being quite sensitive to how computer use is measured.

Finally, we concluded this chapter with a discussion of nontraded goods. Harrigan and Balaban (1999), Harrigan (2000) and Kumar (2000) have argued that the variables which are most highly correlated with the movement in wages over the 1980s and 1990s are neither trade prices nor outsourcing nor high-technology capital, but rather, a sharp increase in the price of

skill-intensive nontraded goods in the U.S. as well as a decrease in the price of unskilled-intensive nontradables. This finding poses a challenge to those who believe that either trade or technology is responsible for the change in wages, and will no doubt be an important area for further research (see Blum, 2001, for example).

# Problems

4.1 In this question we will examine the aggregate demand curve for labor that arises in autarky, and under free trade. Make all the usual assumptions of the 2x2 economy.

(a) First consider the autarky economy, where there is a single representative consumer in the country, and the prices for the goods are determined by supply = demand. Suppose that the endowment of labor increases. Then verbally trace through the effects on the outputs of the goods, relative prices of the goods, and then factor prices. Graph the relationship between the labor endowment and the real wage.
(b) Now consider the same economy but with free trade, and fixed world prices. If there is an increase in the labor endowment, what is the effect on the real wage? Graph this relationship.
(c) Reconsider your answer to part (b), supposing that the labor endowment grows so large that the country moves outside its cone of diversification. How will further increase in the labor endowment affect the real wage? Add this to your graph.

4.2 Consider an economy with two industries and three factors – unskilled labor (L), skilled labor (H) and capital (K).

(a) Suppose that industry one has a higher cost share of unskilled labor and also of capital (think of factory production). Suppose further than the product prices are constant, but that the rental on capital goes up (perhaps because capital is leaving the country). In this case, can we definitely predict what happens to the relative wage of unskilled labor?
(b) Now add a nontraded good, which uses only skilled and unskilled labor. What is the impact of the increase in the rental on capital, and the change in wages, on the price of the nontraded good. Contrast a high-skill-intensive versus low-skill-intensive nontraded good.

# Empirical Exercises

4.1 Download the NBER productivity dataset at http://www.nber.org/nberces/nbprod96.htm, compute the relative wage and relative employment for 1958 - 1996, and reconstruct Figure 4.1 and 4.2. Note: Given this data, you need to first compute the wage rates in production and nonproduction sectors using the following formula:

Production worker wage rate =  $\frac{\sum_{i} production_{i}\text{production}_{i}\text{worker wage}_{i}}{\sum_{i} production_{i}\text{workers}_{i}}$ ,

Non production worker wage rate =  $\frac{\sum_{\mathrm{i}} \text{Non production worker wage bill}}{\sum_{\mathrm{i}} \text{Non production workers}_{\mathrm{i}}}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {\sum_ {i} (\text {t o t a l p a y r o l l} _ {i} - \text {p r o d u c t i o n w o r k e r w a g e b i l l} _ {i})}{\sum_ {i} (\text {t o t a l e m p l o y m e n t} _ {i} - \text {p r o d u c t i o n w o r k e r s} _ {i})} \\ \mathbf {i} = \text {i n d u s t r y} \\ \end{array}
$$

4.2 Store the files for this chapter in the directory: c:\Empirical_Exercise\Chapter_4/. Run the program "Problem_4_2.do" to reproduce the regressions in Table 4.4 (which is simplified from Table III in Feenstra and Hanson, 1999). Then answer: what weights are used in these regressions, and how are the results affected if these weights are not used?

4.3 Run the STATA program "Problem_4_3a.do" to reproduce the regressions in Table 4.5 (i.e. Table I in Feenstra and Hansen, 1999). Then run "Problem_4_3b.do" to perform the two-step regression, Table IV and Table V in Feenstra and Hanson (1999). Note that Table V is obtained using the coefficients in the first column of Table IV.
