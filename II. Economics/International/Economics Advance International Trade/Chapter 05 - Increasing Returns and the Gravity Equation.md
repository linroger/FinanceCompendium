# Chapter 5: Increasing Returns and the Gravity Equation

In this chapter, we make a significant departure from earlier trade models by allowing for increasing returns to scale. The idea that increasing returns might be a reason for trade between countries was well recognized by Bertil Ohlin (1933) and also Frank Graham (1923), and has been the motivation for policy actions. $^{1}$  In Canada, for example, extensive policy discussions in the 1960s argued that Canadian firms would benefit from unrestricted access to the U.S. market. It was believed that the Canadian market was too small to allow manufacturing industries to operate at a minimum efficient scale, and that with access to the U.S. market, firms could move down their average costs curves, which is a gain in efficiency. $^{2}$  Indeed, this was a principal reason that Canada entered in a free trade agreement with the United States in 1989: to give its firms free access to the large American market. As promising as this line of argument is, however, it contains a puzzle: as firms in Canada and the U.S. move down their average cost curves due to access to the other market, surely not all firms can expand output that much, since who would buy it? Thus, an expansion by some firms seems to suggest that others will need to exit the market entirely. So we need a model to sort out these various effects.

The model that is most suited to this purpose is one of monopolistic competition: a market with a large number of firms, each producing a unique variety of a differentiated product, with freedom of entry and exit. This model dates back to Edward Chamberlin (1936) and Joan Robinson (1933) who presented graphical analyses. The widespread use of this model had to wait for a mathematical formulation, however, which was achieved by Lancaster (1975, 1979),

Spence (1976), and Dixit and Stiglitz (1977). Lancaster presented a model in which consumers differed in their "ideal variety" of a differentiated good. In contrast, Spence and Dixit and Stiglitz had a single representative consumer demanding many varieties of the differentiated good, in what is called the "love of variety" approach. Lancaster (1980) and Helpman (1981) applied the "ideal variety" approach to international trade, while Krugman (1979,1980,1981) applied the "love of variety" approach due to Dixit and Stiglitz. The comprehensive treatment by Helpman and Krugman (1985) shows that these two approaches lead to very similar results, so we will use the simpler "love of variety" approach. We begin by describing the model of Krugman (1979).

# Monopolistic Competition Model

We will suppose that there are  $\mathrm{i} = 1, \dots, \mathrm{N}$  product varieties, where the number  $\mathrm{N}$  will be endogenously determined. There is a fixed number  $\mathrm{L}$  of consumers, each of whom receive the following utility from consuming  $c_{\mathrm{i}}$  of each variety:

$$
\mathrm {U} = \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \mathrm {v} \left(\mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right), \quad \mathrm {v} ^ {\prime} > 0, \quad \mathrm {v} ^ {\prime \prime} <   0. \tag {5.1}
$$

Notice that this utility function is symmetric over the product varieties, i.e. the same function  $\mathrm{v}(\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}})$  applies to the consumption of each. Each consumer receives labor income of  $\mathrm{w}$ , so their budget constraint is  $\mathrm{w} = \sum_{\mathrm{i} = 1}^{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}$ . They choose consumption  $\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}$  of each variety to maximize utility in (5.1), subject to this budget constraint. The first-order conditions for this problem are:

$$
v ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {i}\right) = \lambda p _ {i}, i = 1, \dots , N, \tag {5.2}
$$

where  $\lambda$  is the Lagrange multiplier (i.e. the marginal utility of income).

The effect of a change in price on consumption can be derived by totally differentiating the system of equations in (5.2), together with the budget constraint. Normally, such a change in price would affect  $\lambda$ . However, it can be argued that if the number of varieties is sufficiently large, so that the budget share of each of them is small, then we can ignore the impact of a change in one price on  $\lambda$ . In that case, the effect of a change in price is simply:

$$
v ^ {\prime \prime} d c _ {i} = d p _ {i} \lambda \Rightarrow \frac {d c _ {i}}{d p _ {i}} = \frac {\lambda}{v ^ {\prime \prime}} <   0 \tag {5.3}
$$

Using (5.2) and (5.3), we define the elasticity of demand for variety  $i$  as:

$$
\eta_ {\mathrm {i}} = - \frac {\mathrm {d} c _ {\mathrm {i}}}{\mathrm {d} p _ {\mathrm {i}}} \frac {\mathrm {p}}{c _ {\mathrm {i}}} = - \left(\frac {\mathrm {v} ^ {\prime}}{c _ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {v} ^ {\prime \prime}}\right) > 0. \tag {5.4}
$$

While the assumptions we have made on v (increasing and concave) ensure that the elasticity is positive, we do not in general know whether it is increasing or decreasing in  $c_i$ . This will turn out to be quite important, and we shall assume that  $\frac{d\eta_i}{dc_i} < 0$ , so that as we move up a demand curve (consumption falling) the elasticity rises. The reader should verify that this assumption holds for a linear demand curve, and more generally, for any demand curve that is "less convex" that a constant-elasticity curve.

On the production side, labor is the only resource and each firm requires the following labor to produce output of  $y_{i}$ :

$$
\mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {i}} = \alpha + \beta \mathrm {y} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \tag {5.5}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is the fixed labor input needed for production, and  $\beta$  is the marginal labor input. Given the equilibrium wage  $w$ , it follows that average costs for the firms are,  $AC_{i} = wL_{i} / y_{i} = w\alpha / y_{i} + w\beta$ , while marginal costs are simply  $w\beta$ . These are both graphed in Figure 5.1.

Monopolistic competition has two key equilibrium conditions for firms. First, each firm maximizes its own profits, requiring that marginal revenue equal marginal cost (MR=MC). Second, there is free entry whenever economic profits are positive, so in the long-run equilibrium we must have zero profits, or price equal to average cost (P=AC). In addition to these, we will add the requirement that the equilibrium is "symmetric," meaning that prices and quantities are identical across varieties. Dropping the subscript i, we therefore have the equilibrium conditions:

$$
\mathrm {M R} = \mathrm {M C}: \quad \mathrm {p} \left(1 - \frac {1}{\eta}\right) = \mathrm {w} \beta , \quad \text {o r} \quad \frac {\mathrm {p}}{\mathrm {w}} = \beta \left(\frac {\eta}{\eta - 1}\right) \tag {5.6}
$$

$$
P = A C: \quad p = \left(\frac {w \alpha}{y}\right) + w \beta , \quad o r \quad \frac {p}{w} = \left(\frac {\alpha}{L c}\right) + \beta \tag {5.7}
$$

Notice that in (5.7), we have replaced supply of each good,  $y$ , by the demand for each good,  $Lc$ . Equations (5.6) and (5.7) form two equations to solve for the two unknowns,  $(p/w)$  and  $c$ . The first of these equations is graphed as the line PP in Figure 5.2. Our assumption that  $d\eta_i / dc_i < 0$  ensures that the PP curve is upward sloping. Turning to equation (5.7), this is graphed as the downward sloping line ZZ in Figure 5.2, which is simply the firm's average cost curve. The intersection of these two curves determines the equilibrium values of  $(p/w)$  and  $c$ . Then to determine the equilibrium number of product  $N$ , we make use of full-employment in the economy, which is stated as:

$$

from which it follows that:

$$
N = \frac {1}{\left[ (\alpha / L) + \beta c \right]}. \tag {5.9}
$$

The equilibrium value of  $c$  therefore determines the number of products  $N$ .

So far, we have represented the equilibrium for a single economy. But the effects of trade are easily introduced. For example, suppose that two countries of identical size move from autarky to free trade. Notice that because the economies are identical, then in the Heckscher-Ohlin model there would be absolutely no reason for trade between them. But in the monopolistic competition model, there will be a rationale for trade: firms will begin to export to the other country, and at the same time, face competition from firms abroad. This increase in the number of competitors can be expected to lower the equilibrium price. This is exactly what happens, as can be confirmed from the equilibrium conditions.

Having the two identical countries trading is just like doubling the population L. This has no impact on the PP curve [since L does not appear in (5.6)], but it does shift the ZZ curve down [as can be seen from (5.7)]. Therefore, the equilibrium consumption of each variety falls, from  $c_0$  to  $c_1$ , while the real wage rises, from  $(w/p)_0$  to  $(w/p)_1$ . Consumption falls because individuals are spreading their expenditures over more product varieties, and this raises the elasticity of demand, reducing the equilibrium prices and therefore raising real wages. This is a source of gain for consumers. But there is also a second source of gain from trade, because with the rise in L and fall in c, it can be verified from (5.9) that total product variety increases. That is, the sum of varieties from both countries under free trade exceeds the number in any single country before trade.

But notice that the number of varieties produced in each country necessarily falls with the opening of trade. This can be seen by noting that the fall in  $(\mathrm{p / w})$ , as firms move down their average cost curve, necessarily implies that output  $y$  increases. This means that any firm that produces both in autarky and under free trade will be selling more with trade. But the full-employment conditions for each economy is  $\mathrm{L} = \mathrm{N}(\alpha + \beta y)$ , where now  $\mathrm{L}$  is fixed. So the increase in  $y$ , as firms exploit economies of scale, necessarily implies a reduction in the number of firms in each country. This resolves the question raised at the beginning of the chapter: opening trade between countries indeed implies that firms must exit in each, while the remaining firms expand their output and take advantage of scale economies.

# Evidence from the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement

To summarize, Krugman's model contains two predictions concerning the impact of trade on the productivity of firms: the scale effect, as surviving firms expand their outputs, and the selection effect, as some firms are forced to exit. Which one of these effects is most important in practice? This is a question of some importance since the dislocation of workers caused by the bankruptcy of firms is bound to bring costs to them. This was certainly true in Canada after it entered into the free trade agreement with the U.S. on January 1, 1989, because at the same time, Canada also had a tight monetary policy that led to further job loss. The early computable general equilibrium model of Harris (1984) and Cox and Harris (1985, 1986), done before the 1989 agreement, presumed substantial scale economies based on engineering estimates for various industries, and predicted very high efficiency gains for Canada. These estimates were influential in Canadian policy circles as the merits of the agreement with the U.S. were being debated. With more than a decade since the Canada-U.S. FTA has been in effect, there are now several studies we can look to that quantify the scale versus selection effect empirically.

The scale effect – that surviving firms will expand their scale of production following trade liberalization – has unfortunately not been borne out empirically. Head and Ries (1999) use plant level data for a sample of 230 Canadian industries over 1988-1994 to examine the impact on plant scale in the six years following the free trade agreement with the United States. They find that the tariff reductions in the U.S. increased plant scale in Canada by some  $10\%$  on average, but this was largely offset by a  $8.5\%$  reduction in plant scale due to the reductions in Canadian tariffs. On net, therefore, the free trade agreement had only a small impact on scale. This type of evidence is also found from tariff reductions in a wide range of developing countries, where the average scale of firms in import-competing industries either shrank following liberalization, or expanded only slightly. The only silver lining to this result is that it appears the extent of economies of scale is not that great in the first place, so that any reduction in scale does not really cause higher costs. In addition, evidence from developing countries shows that the markup of price over marginal costs is indeed reduced following tariff reductions, so consumers gain in that respect.

Turning to the selection effect, this is another avenue through which productivity in an industry can change following liberalization. In particular, if the least-efficient firms are the ones to exit, then average industry productivity will rise. Note that this is outside the framework of the original Krugman model, since it makes the "symmetry" assumption that all firms were of the same size and efficiency (it follows that the exit of some would not automatically change average productivity). This assumption was made for analytical convenience, but contradicts the empirical fact that every industry has a very wide range of firms operating within it. Indeed, it is only recently that trade theory has caught up with this empirical fact, and there are now several

models that allows for a range of firms with differing productivities, due to Melitz (2002) and Yeaple (2002), that can predict the effects of tariff reductions. In these models, the gains from the Canada-U.S. free trade area would come not from scale effects, but rather, from selection effects, whereby the least efficient firms exit after liberalization.

The empirical evidence on this comes from Trefler (2001), which is the first attempt to comprehensively assess the impact of this agreement on productivity within Canada. Trefler concludes that:

For industries subject to large tariff cuts (these are typically "low-end" manufacturing industries), the short-run costs included a  $15\%$  decline in employment and about a  $10\%$  decline in both output and the number of plants. Balanced against these large short-run adjustment costs were long-run labour productivity gains of  $17\%$  or a spectacular  $1.0\%$  per year. Although good capital stock and plant-level data are lacking, an attempt is made to identify the sources of FTA-induced labour productivity growth. Surprisingly, this growth is not due to rising output per plant, increased investment, or market share shifts to high-productivity plants. Instead, half of the  $17\%$  labour productivity growth appears due to favourable plant turnover (entry and exit) and rising technical efficiency.

Thus, productivity in Canada was increased due to free trade with the U.S. from the selection effect, not the scale effect.

The finding that the scale of Canadian firms did not change much (on net) following the FTA can be explained from several models, as discussed in Head and Ries (1999, 2002). We note here one particularly simple theoretical result: if the elasticity of demand for product varieties is constant, then firm scale will not change at all due to tariffs or trade liberalization. A utility function that leads to this case is the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function:

$$
\mathrm {U} = \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {(\sigma - 1) / \sigma}, \tag {5.10}
$$

The elasticity of substitution between products is equal to  $\sigma > 1$ , which also equals the elasticity of demand  $\eta$  when  $N$  is large. This implies that the markup of prices over marginal costs is fixed,  $p / (\beta w) = [\sigma / (\sigma - 1)]$ .

Substituting this optimal price into the expression for profits of the firm we obtain:

$$
\mathrm {p y} - \mathrm {w} (\alpha + \beta \mathrm {y}) = \mathrm {w} \left[ \left(\frac {\beta \mathrm {y}}{\sigma - 1}\right) - \alpha \right]. \tag {5.11}
$$

In order to have zero profits in equilibrium, it follows that the output of firms is fixed at,

$$
\bar {y} = (\sigma - 1) \alpha / \beta . \tag {5.12}
$$

So there is no scale effect in a model using (5.10), though trade will still affect the product variety available to consumers. The product variety produced in each country is readily solved from (5.12) and the full-employment condition (5.8), obtaining  $\mathrm{N} = \mathrm{L} / (\alpha + \beta \overline{\mathrm{y}})$ . Thus, the number of varieties produced does not change due to trade in this CES model, so there is no selection effect either, but the number of varieties consumed will increase due to those available from imports.

The key advantage of using the CES functional form is that it is homothetic, whereas this will not hold for any other choice of  $\mathrm{v}(\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}})$  in (5.1). For this reason the CES functional form is commonly used in the monopolistic competition literature, and despite its special properties,

and we shall also make use of it later in the chapter.

# The Gravity Equation

In the monopolistic competition model, each country will be exporting varieties of the differentiated product to each other. While firms in different countries may produce the same product varieties in autarky, we assume they can costlessly leave one variety and produce another, so that with trade it is profit maximizing to produce different varieties. In other words, the countries are completely specialized in different product varieties. Trade in these product varieties is referred to as "intra-industry trade." Notice that complete specialization and intra-industry trade does not occur in the two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin model: countries may be producing in the same industries, but they either export or import in each industry – not both. In the Heckscher-Ohlin model with a continuum of goods, however, we do have complete specialization in different products when factor prices are unequal, as described in chapter 3. The common feature of the monopolistic competition model and the HO model with a continuum of goods is that they both have many more goods than factors: that is what allows for complete specialization in different product varieties across countries. In this case, it turns out that trade patterns can be described by a remarkably simple equation called the "gravity equation."

In its simplest form, the gravity equation states that the bilateral trade between two countries is directly proportional to the product of the countries GDP's. Thus, larger countries will tend to trade more with each other, and countries that are more similar in their relative sizes will also trade more. This equation performs extremely well empirically, as has been known since the original work of Tinbergen (1962). Our goal in this section is to derive this simple

version of the gravity equation, under the assumption of free trade, so that all countries have identical prices. In later sections, we will loosen this assumption and allow for differing prices due to trade barriers between countries, which turns out to be quite important.

To the assumption that countries are specialized in different varieties of a final product, let us add that demand is identical and homothetic across countries, and that trade is free (no tariffs or transport costs). Then it follows that a good produced in any country is sent to all other countries in proportion to the purchasing country's GDP. To formalize this, consider a multi-country framework where i,j=1,...,C denotes countries, and k=1,...,N denotes products (any variety of a good counts as a distinct product). Let y<sub>k</sub> denote country i's production of good k. Since prices are the same across all countries, we normalize them to unity, so y<sub>k</sub> actually measures the value of production. The total GDP in each country is measured by Y = ∑k=1N y<sub>k</sub> , and world GDP is Y = ∑i=1C Y.

Let  $s^j$  denote country  $j$ 's share of world expenditure. Assuming that trade is balanced in each country, the  $s^j$  also denotes country  $j$ 's share of world GDP, so that  $s^j = Y^j / Y^w$ . Then under the assumptions that all countries are producing different products, and demand is identical and homothetic, the exports from country  $i$  to county  $j$  of product  $k$  are given by:

$$
\mathrm {X} _ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} = \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \mathrm {y} _ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \quad . \tag {5.13}
$$

Summing over all products  $\mathbf{k}$ , we obtain:

$$
X ^ {i j} = \sum_ {k} X _ {k} ^ {i j} = s ^ {j} \sum_ {k} y _ {k} ^ {i} = s ^ {j} Y ^ {i} = \frac {Y ^ {j} Y ^ {i}}{Y ^ {w}} = s ^ {j} s ^ {i} Y ^ {w} = X ^ {j i}. \tag {5.14}
$$

Summing the first and last of these terms, we therefore find that bilateral trade between two countries equals,

$$
\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {j i}} = \left(\frac {2}{\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {w}}}\right) \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}. \tag {5.15}
$$

This gives our simplest derivation of the gravity equation, where the bilateral exports from country  $i$  to country  $j$  are proportional to the product of their GDP's. This simple model has many empirical applications, and we shall discuss two.

# Empirical Applications of the Gravity Equation

# Trade Within and Outside the Oecd

As a first application of the gravity equation, we consider the work of Helpman (1987). The goal of his work is to give an alternative characterization of the gravity equation, emphasizing the role of differential country size. Thus, consider an economic region consisting of two countries. Then holding fixed the economic size of this region, two countries of unequal size will not trade as much as would two countries of similar size. To demonstrate this, let us sum the first and last of terms in (5.14) to obtain:

$$
\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {j i}} = 2 \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {w}}. \tag {5.16}
$$

It will be convenient to re-express this equation as depending on each country's share of GDP relative to each other. So let us say that these two countries belong to "region A" of the world, and denote the sum GDP of these two countries by  $\mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{A}} = \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} + \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}}$ . Then their relative shares of regional GDP are expressed as  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{iA}} = \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{A}}$ , and the GDP of region A relative to the world is  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{A}} = \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{A}} / \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{w}}$ . Then (5.16) can be re-written as,  $(\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{ij}} + \mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{ji}}) / \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{A}} = 2\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{iA}}\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{jA}}\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{A}}$ . The

shares of regional GDP sum to unity,  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{iA}} + \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{jA}} = 1$ , and squaring this we obtain

$2 \mathrm{~s}^{\mathrm{iA}} \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{jA}} = 1 - (\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{iA}})^{2} - (\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{jA}})^{2}$ . Substituting this back into the previous equation, we have

therefore shown:

# Theorem (Helpman, 1987)

If countries are completely specialized in their outputs, tastes are identical and homothetic, and there is free trade worldwide, then the volume of trade among countries in region A relative to their GDP is:

$$
\frac {\text {V o l u m e o f t r a d e i n A}}{\mathrm {G D P} ^ {\mathrm {A}}} = \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {A}} \left(1 - \sum_ {\mathrm {i} \in \mathrm {A}} \left(\mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {i A}}\right) ^ {2}\right). \tag {5.17}
$$

We have derived this result above for the case of two countries in a region, but Helpman shows that it holds for a region of many countries. The term  $\left(1 - \sum_{\mathrm{i} \in \mathrm{A}} (\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{iA}})^2\right)$  appearing on the right of (5.17) is a "size dispersion index." It shows how the volume of trade will be related to the relative size of countries. To understand the properties of this index, suppose that there are N countries in region A. Then the index is maximized for countries of the same relative size 1/N, in which case it equals [1-(1/N)]. Conversely, as any country has a share approaching unity, then the dispersion index also approaches zero. The theorem says that the volume of trade relative to GDP will be proportional to the dispersion index.

Helpman (1987) tests (5.17) for a group of OECD countries. In the simplest test, he graphs the dispersion index against the volume of trade relative to GDP for these countries. Both of these variables are indeed increasing over time, i.e. countries are getting more similar in size and trade is growing. Hummels and Levinsohn (1995) extended this comparison to non-OECD countries as well. We will discuss the results of Debaere (2002), who provides the most

complete treatment. Let us specify the region A as any pair of countries,  $\mathrm{A} = \{\mathrm{i},\mathrm{j}\}$ . Then (5.17) is written in logs as:

$$
\ln \left(\frac {\mathbf {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \mathbf {X} ^ {\mathrm {j i}}}{\mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) = \ln \left(\mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) + \ln \left[ 1 - \left(\frac {\mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}}}{\mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {2} - \left(\frac {\mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}{\mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {2} \right]. \tag {5.18}
$$

Debaere tests these relations using a dataset covering 1970-1989, over a sample of OECD and non-OECD countries. Recognizing that the variables also depend on time, let us write the estimating equation in (5.18) as:

$$
\ln \left(\frac {\mathrm {X} _ {\mathrm {t}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \mathrm {X} _ {\mathrm {t}} ^ {\mathrm {j i}}}{\mathrm {Y} _ {\mathrm {t}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathrm {Y} _ {\mathrm {t}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) = \alpha_ {\mathrm {i j}} + \gamma \ln \left(\mathrm {s} _ {\mathrm {t}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathrm {s} _ {\mathrm {t}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) + \beta \ln \left(\text {D i s p e r s i o n} _ {\mathrm {t}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}\right), \tag {5.19}
$$

where  $\alpha_{ij}$  is a fixed effect for each country pair,  $\gamma$  is a coefficient on the log sum of country shares, and  $\beta$  is a coefficient on the size dispersion index, which equals the final bracketed term on the right of (5.18). Notice that if the country shares are roughly constant over time, then the fixed effect  $\alpha_{ij}$  in (5.19) would absorb this term. This was implicitly assumed by Hummels and Levinsohn (1995), so Debaere runs two versions of (5.19): first excluding the term  $\ln(s_t^i + s_t^j)$ , which treats the country shares as constant over time; and then including this term, which allows the country share to vary over time. These two versions are shown in parts (a) and (b) of Table 5.1.

Debaere also uses several different methods to measure the country GDP shares and dispersion index. Since GDP should be measured in a common currency – the U.S. dollar – it

can be converted from national currencies using either nominal exchange rates or purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. The former – nominal GDP in U.S. dollars – is available from the International Financial Statistics (IFS) of the International Monetary Fund, which is a standard source for macroeconomic data across countries. The latter – real GDP converted to dollars using PPP exchange rates – is available from the Penn World Tables (PWT). We would expect that the latter is more reliable to construct the country GDP shares and dispersion index, but report results from both PWT and IFS. In addition, Debaere reports results obtained when country populations are used as an instrumental variable for GDP, so the country shares and dispersion index are calculated using predicted GDP's from this first-stage regression.

We are especially interested in testing whether  $\beta$  is close to unity, as Helpman's equation implies. The estimates of (5.19) over 14 OECD countries are shown in columns (1)-(4) of Table 5.1. Looking first at part (a) which ignores the term  $\ln (s_t^i + s_t^j)$ , in regression (1) using country GDP's from the PWT, we find that  $\beta$  is insignificantly different from unity. In regression (2), using the GDP's in nominal dollars from the IFS,  $\beta$  is estimated at 0.55 which is obviously less than unity but is still positive and highly significant. The instrumental variable regressions in columns (3) and (4) both have higher estimates of  $\beta$  on the dispersion index, but again they are positive and highly significant. When the log sum of country shares is introduced in part (b), the estimates of  $\beta$  are generally increased further.

For the group of non-OECD countries used, the results are quite different. Using real GDP's from the PWT, in columns (5) and (7), the dispersion index has a negative coefficient. This contradicts Helpman's results in (5.17), and more generally, contradicts the gravity equation. We should not be surprised by this, however, because the gravity equation was based on the assumption that countries are specialized in different goods. This may be a reasonable

description of trade between industrialized countries (e.g. Italian shoes are different from American shoes), but it is a poor description of trade between developing countries that export basic agricultural goods or low-skilled commodities. In that case, there is no reason at all for the gravity equation to hold, and this is what we are finding in the non-OECD results where  $\beta$  is negative.

It turns out that when nominal GDP's from the IFS is used instead for the non-OECD countries, as in columns (6) and (8), then  $\beta$  is instead positive but in most cases just barely significant. In addition, the regressions for the non-OECD countries have much lower  $\mathbf{R}^2$  than for the OECD countries. In summary, the results in Table 5.1 show that Helpman's formulation of the gravity equation in (5.17) is strongly supported for the OECD countries, but receives little or no support for the non-OECD countries. This accords with our expectation that specialization in different goods is much more prevalent for the industrialized countries.

# Trade Within and Between Canada and the U.s.

A second application of the gravity model, and one that has stimulated a large amount of research, came from comparing intra-national trade between Canadian provinces to international trade between Canadian provinces and U.S. states. This was the question posed by McCallum (1995) in a study using 1988 data, just before the Canada-U.S. FTA was signed. He estimated a gravity model like (5.15) where bilateral trade between Canadian provinces, or between a Canadian province and U.S. state, should depend on each of their province or state GDP's. Specifically, the regression estimated by McCallum is:

$$
\ln \left(\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {j i}}\right) = \alpha + \beta_ {1} \ln \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \beta_ {2} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} + \gamma \delta^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \rho \ln \mathrm {d} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \varepsilon_ {\mathrm {i j}}, \tag {5.20}
$$

where  $\delta^{\mathrm{ij}}$  is an indicator variable that equals unity for trade between two Canadian provinces and zero otherwise, and  $d^{\mathrm{ij}}$  is the distance between any two provinces or states. The results from estimating (5.20) using 1988 data are shown in column (1) of Table 5.2. The same regression using 1993 data is shown in column (2). Note that McCallum's dataset included trade between Canadian provinces, and provinces and states, but not trade between the U.S. states. This is added in column (3) using 1993 data, in which case we also include an indicator variable that equals one when trade is between two U.S. states and zero otherwise.

The results in columns (1)-(3) show coefficients on provincial or state GDP close to unity, and strong negative relationship between distance and trade. This is no surprise. What is unexpected is the very large coefficient on cross-provincial trade: ranging from 3.09 in column (1) to 2.75 in column (3). Taking the exponents of these, we obtain the estimates on "Canada trade" shown at the bottom of the table, indicating the cross-provincial trade is some 22 times larger than cross-border trade in 1988, and 15.7 times larger in 1993. These numbers are extraordinarily high! They are meant to capture any and all factors that might impede trade between the U.S. and Canada, or what we might call "border effects." It seems nearly unbelievable, however, that these factors would lead to 16 or 22 times more internal trade in Canada than external trade.

How is it that the Canada-U.S. border can apparently have an impact this large? The answer from recent work of Anderson and van Wincoop (2001) is that border effects have an asymmetric effect on countries of different size, and in particular, have a larger effect on small countries. To understand their argument, we can run through a numerical example using

Canada-U.S. trade. Let us make the realistic assumption that the U.S. is 10 times bigger economically. It follows that:

- With frictionless trade, Canada exports  $90\%$  of GDP to U.S., so it sells  $10\%$  internally
- Suppose the border effect reduces cross-border trade by a factor of one-half
- Then, Canada exports  $45\%$  of its GDP to U.S., so it must trade  $55\%$  internally
- So internal trade went up by 5.5 times (from  $10\%$  to  $55\%$ ), cross-border down by one-half (from  $90\%$  to  $45\%$ ), and so internal trade has increased by 11 times more than cross-border trade
- If we ask what has happened in the U.S., it used to export  $10\%$  of its output to Canada, and now it exports only  $5\%$ . So internal trade has risen from  $90\%$  to  $95\%$  of output – a modest change – while external trade has fallen in half. We conclude that cross-state trade has increased by slightly more than 2 times cross-border trade.

We can see from this example that comparing cross-state trade to cross-border trade for the U.S. (a large country) gives a reasonable estimate of the true border effect (which was a factor of one-half), but that comparing cross-provincial trade with cross-border trade for Canada (a small country) gives a really exaggerated estimate of the border effect. To avoid this bias, we need to re-derive the gravity equation while introducing trade barriers (such as transport costs or tariffs) right from the start. This means that prices differ across countries. Anderson (1979) was the first to derive the gravity equation while taking into account these "price effects." Estimating the resulting equation still presents a challenge, however, and we shall discuss three approaches: the use of prices indexes to measure the price effects in the gravity equation, as in Bergstrand (1985,1989) and Baier and Bergstrand (2001); the use of estimated border effects to measure the

price effects, as in Anderson and van Wincoop (2001); and the use of fixed effects to account for the price effects, as in Harrigan (1996), Hummels (1999), Redding and Venables (2000) and others. Our derivation of the gravity equation follows Redding and Venables.

# Border Effects in the Gravity Model

When there are border effects, such as transport costs or tariffs, then it is no longer the case that prices are equalized across countries, so the pattern of trade is more complex than in the gravity equation (5.15). The only way to sort this out is to assume a specific utility function, and we shall adopt the CES specification. We let  $c_{k}^{ij}$  denote the exports from country  $i$  to country  $j$  of good  $k$ . Because each country produces unique product varieties, the exports of good  $k$  from country  $i$  to  $j$  are identical to the consumption of good  $k$  in country  $j$ . In contrast to Krugman's model, we now let  $c_{k}^{ij}$  denote total consumption of good  $k$  in country  $j$ , rather than per-capita consumption. We will suppose that country  $i = 1,\dots,C$  produces  $N^i$  products. Then utility for country  $j$  is:

$$
U ^ {j} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {C} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {N ^ {i}} \left(c _ {k} ^ {i j}\right) ^ {(\sigma - 1) / \sigma}, \tag {5.21}
$$

The triple-index on consumption is a bit unwieldy, but this can be simplified by assuming that all products exported by country  $i$  sell for the same price  $p^{ij}$  in country  $j$ . These prices are inclusive of transport costs from country  $i$  to  $j$ , on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, freight) basis. In contrast, the local prices  $p^i$  for goods produced in country  $i$  are net of any transport costs, on a f.o.b. (free on board) basis. Let us model the relationship between these as:  $p^{ij} = T^{ij}p^i$ , where  $T^{ii} = 1$  and  $T^{ij} \geq 1$ , indicating that  $T^{ij}$  units of the product must be shipped to country  $j$  in order for

one unit to arrive; the amount  $(\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}} - 1)$  "melts" along the way. This formulation is called "iceberg" transport costs and was introduced by Samuelson (1952).

With equal transport costs across varieties, then consumption in country  $j$  is also equal over all the products  $k = 1,\ldots ,N^{\dot{1}}$  sold by country  $i$ , so that  $c_{k}^{ij} = c^{ij}$ . Then the utility function is simplified as:

$$
U ^ {j} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {C} N ^ {i} \left(c ^ {i j}\right) ^ {(\sigma - 1) / \sigma} \tag {5.22}
$$

where  $c^{ij}$  now denotes the consumption of any product sent from country  $i$  to country  $j$ .

The representative consumer in country  $j$  maximizes (5.22) subject to the budget constraint:

$$
Y ^ {j} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {C} N ^ {i} p ^ {i j} c ^ {i j} \tag {5.23}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{j}}$  is aggregate expenditure and income in country j (we will assume balanced trade).

Maximizing (5.22) subject to (5.23), we can derive the following expression for the demand for each product  $c^{ij,8}$ :

$$
\mathrm {c} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} = \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} / \mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {- \sigma} \left(\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} / \mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right), \tag {5.24}
$$

where  $\mathbf{P}^{\mathrm{j}}$  refers to country j's overall price index, defined as:

$$
\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}} = \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \mathrm {N} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma}\right) ^ {1 / (1 - \sigma)}. \tag {5.25}
$$

To compare this with our earlier derivation of gravity equation in (5.15), let us express the total value of exports from country  $i$  to  $j$ . This will be  $\mathrm{X}^{ij} \equiv \mathrm{N}^i \mathrm{p}^{ij} \mathrm{c}^{ij}$ , or from (5.24) and (5.25),

$$
\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} = \mathrm {N} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma}. \tag {5.26}
$$

# Estimating the Gravity Equation

# Using Price Index Data

In order to estimate (5.26), we should recognize that the "true" number of products  $\mathbf{N}^{\mathrm{i}}$  in each country is unobservable. One approach, then, is to solve for this using the zero-profit conditions. Assuming that labor is the only factor of production and using the same production functions as in Krugman (1979), it follows that firm output is fixed as in (5.12). Then GDP in country i is  $\mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathbf{N}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{i}}\overline{\mathbf{y}}$ , and substituting this into (5.26) we obtain,

$$
\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} = \frac {\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}{\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \bar {\mathrm {y}}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} = \frac {\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}{\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i} \sigma} \bar {\mathrm {y}}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma}, \tag {5.26'}
$$

where we use  $\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{ij}}\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{i}}$  to obtain the last expression. The approach of Bergstrand (1985, 1989) and Baier and Bergstrand (2001) is to estimate (5.26') directly, where the variables on the right are country GDP's, tariffs and transport costs  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  (measured with IFS data), and country prices  $\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{i}}$  or  $\mathbf{P}^{\mathrm{j}}$  (measured with GDP deflators).

Specifically, taking the logs and first-differences of the variables in (5.26'), we obtain the estimating equation,

$$
\Delta \ln X ^ {i j} = \Delta \ln \left(Y ^ {i} Y ^ {j}\right) + (1 - \sigma) \Delta \ln T ^ {i j} - \sigma \Delta \ln p ^ {i} + (\sigma - 1) \Delta \ln P ^ {j}. \tag {5.27}
$$

The term  $(\mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}})$  appearing in (5.27) can be further decomposed as  $(\mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} + \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}})^{2}(\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}})$ , where  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}}$  here denote the shares of each country's GDP relative to their sum, i.e.  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} = \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} / (\mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} + \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}})$ , and similarly for  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}}$ . Therefore, we can re-write (5.27) as,

$$
\Delta \ln X ^ {i j} = 2 \Delta \ln \left(Y ^ {i} + Y ^ {j}\right) + \Delta \ln \left(s ^ {i} s ^ {j}\right) + (1 - \sigma) \Delta \ln T ^ {i j} - \sigma \Delta \ln p ^ {i} + (\sigma - 1) \Delta \ln P ^ {j}. \tag {5.27'}
$$

In this formulation, we see that the growth of trade depends on changes in transport costs, changes in the sum of GDP, changes in relative country size measured by  $(\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}})$ , and changes in the prices of each country, measured with GDP deflators. Because  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} + \mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}} = 1$ , then squaring both sides we obtain,  $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}} = [1 - (\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}})^{2} - (\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}})^{2}] / 2$ , so the variable  $(\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}})$  in (5.27') is the same as Helpman's size dispersion index in (5.17).

Using data for 16 OECD countries, and taking differences between the averages in 1958-60 and 1986-88, Baier and Bergstrand (2001, p. 19) estimate the following regression (with standard errors in parentheses):

$$
\Delta \ln X ^ {i j} = 0. 0 5 + 2. 3 7 \Delta \ln \left(Y ^ {i} + Y ^ {j}\right) + 0. 6 0 \Delta \ln \left(s ^ {i} s ^ {j}\right) - 4. 4 9 \Delta \ln \left(1 + \tau^ {i j}\right) - 3. 1 9 \Delta \ln \left(1 + a ^ {i j}\right)
$$

$$

$$
(0. 3 4)
$$

$$
(1. 0 0)
$$

$$
(0. 3 7)
$$

$$
- 0. 6 8 \Delta \ln \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} - 0. 2 5 \Delta \ln \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}} / \mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) - 0. 0 8 \ln \mathrm {X} _ {0} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}, \quad \mathrm {R} ^ {2} = 0. 4 0, \mathrm {N} = 2 4 0. \tag {5.28}
$$

$$
(0. 2 4)
$$

$$
(0. 0 9)
$$

$$
(0. 0 3)
$$

The variables appearing in the first line of (5.28) follow directly from the specification in (5.27'), where the term  $\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  has been broken up into tariffs  $(\tau^{\mathrm{ij}})$  and transport costs  $(a^{\mathrm{ij}})$ . Both of these enter with negative and highly significant coefficients. The log sum of country GDP's has a

coefficient that is close to 2, as expected from (5.27'), while the product of shares  $(\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}})$  has a coefficient that is insignificantly different from unity, as expected from the gravity equation and Helpman's (1987) formulation.

The terms appearing on the second line of (5.28) are slightly different from those in (5.27'). First, Baier and Bergstrand's modeling of supply is somewhat more general than ours, which leads to the extra term  $\ln \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}}$  in (5.28), which has a negative coefficient. Second, the prices that appear separately in (5.27') are combined as a ratio in (5.28), and measured with GDP price deflators. Third, they include the initial amount of trade in 1958-60,  $\ln \mathrm{X}_0^{\mathrm{ij}}$ , as a regressor in (5.28) to allow for the lagged adjustment of trade flows.

Overall, with an  $\mathbf{R}^2$  of 0.40, this gravity equation explains nearly one-half of the changes in bilateral trade flows for the OECD countries. Furthermore, we can use the variables that appear in the first line of (5.28) to explain the growth in trade between 1958-60 and 1986-88. Over these three decades, bilateral trade between the 16 OECD countries used in the sample grew by  $150\%$ . Of this,  $100\%$  or two-thirds of the total was explained by the growth in GDP (i.e. the first variable on the right of (5.28) after the constant, times its coefficient). Next, the actual reductions in tariffs, times its coefficient in (5.28), explains another  $38\%$  increase in trade, or roughly one-quarter of the total. Third, the actual reduction in transport costs, times its coefficient in (5.28), explains a further  $12\%$  increase in trade, or one-twelfth of the total. So we conclude that the reduction in tariffs is about three times as important as the reduction in transport costs in explaining increased OECD trade.

Notice that these three variables (sum of GDP's, tariffs and transport costs) explain the entire increase in trade, leaving no role at all for the convergence in relative country size, which is the term  $\Delta \ln (\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}})$  in (5.28). While this term is positive on average across all OECD countries for 1958-60 to 1986-88, it is actually negative but very small  $(-3\%)$  for the 16 countries used in the sample. In other words, there is a slight divergence in size of real GDP among the 16 OECD countries used, which explains a slight reduction in trade (of  $2\%$ ) rather than an increase in trade. Note that this occurs despite the fact that the coefficient on the GDP shares  $\Delta \ln (\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}})$  is insignificantly different from unity in (5.28), as predicted by the gravity equation and Helpman's (1987) formulation. So while this variable passed the statistical test of having a coefficient of the correct sign and magnitude (as we also found for the OECD countries in Table 5.1), it fails to be economically important in explaining the growth in trade among the OECD countries.

# Using Estimated Border Effects

An objection to using published price indexes to measure  $\mathfrak{p}^1$  and  $\mathbf{P}^j$  is that these indexes may not accurately reflect the "true" border effects. That is, the myriad of costs (in money, time and currency risk) involved in making transactions across the border are probably not reflected in aggregate price indexes.[10] So instead of using data to measure prices, we might want to model the c.i.f. prices  $\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  as differing from the f.o.b. prices  $\mathfrak{p}^i$  due to distance and other factors, as with:

$$
\ln \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} = \tau^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \rho \ln \mathrm {d} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \varepsilon_ {\mathrm {i j}}, \tag {5.29}
$$

where  $d^{ij}$  is the distance between country  $i$  and  $j$ ,  $\tau^{ij}$  is any other "border effect" associated with selling from country  $i$  to  $j$ , and  $\varepsilon_{ij}$  is a random error. We should think of  $\rho$  and  $\tau^{ij}$  as being estimated, though we will have to explain how this is done. Generally,  $T^{ij}$  is meant to include all effects limiting trade between countries  $i$  and  $j$ , so referring to it as "iceberg" transportation costs is something of a misuse of language.

Substituting (5.29) back into the gravity equation (5.26) to eliminate the terms  $p^{ij} = T^{ij}p^i$ , we obtain a set of equations where the exports between country  $i$  and  $j$  depend on the parameters  $\tau^{ij}$  and  $\rho$ . This set of equations is highly non-linear, however, so it is difficult to estimate these parameters directly. Instead, the approach of Anderson and van Wincoop (2001) is to further simplify the gravity equation making use of the market clearing conditions, as follows.

Notice that with the iceberg transportation costs, the output of the firm exceeds the net amount received by consumer, since these are related by:

$$
\mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} = \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \mathrm {c} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}. \tag {5.30}
$$

Multiplying this by the price  $p^i$ , we obtain  $p^i y^i = \sum_{j=1}^{C} p^{ij} c^{ij}$ , which is an equality between the value of output of the firm (using the f.o.b. prices but before the output has "melted") and the expenditure of consumers (using the c.i.f. prices but after the quantity delivered has "melted"). In principle, we can use the market clearing conditions (5.30) to solve for the unknown prices  $p^i$ . Rather than obtain an explicit solution for prices, Anderson and van Wincoop (2001) make use of a convenient implicit solution. To develop their result, we again denote country  $i$ 's GDP by  $Y^i = N^i p^i y^i$ , world GDP by  $Y^w = \sum_{j=1}^{C} Y^j$ , and country  $i$ 's share by  $s^i = Y^i / Y^w$ .

# Theorem (Anderson and Van Wincoop, 2001)

Suppose that the transportation costs are symmetric,  $\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ji}}$ . Then an implicit solution to the market clearing conditions (5.30) is:

$$
\widetilde {\mathrm {p}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \equiv \left(\mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {i}} / \mathrm {N} ^ {\mathrm {i}}\right) ^ {1 / (1 - \sigma)} / \widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}, \tag {5.31}
$$

in which case the price indexes are solved as:

$$
\left(\widetilde {P} ^ {j}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {C} s ^ {i} \left(T ^ {i j} / \widetilde {P} ^ {i}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma}. \tag {5.32}
$$

# Proof:

We will show that substituting (5.31) into the price index (5.25), and substituting (5.31) into the market clearing conditions (5.30), both lead to equation (5.32). First, substituting  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{ij}}$ $= \left(\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{N}^{\mathrm{i}}\right)^{1 / (1 - \sigma)}\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}} / \widetilde{\mathrm{P}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  into (5.25), we immediately obtain (5.32). Second, rewrite the market clearing conditions (5.30) as,

$$
Y ^ {i} = N ^ {i} p ^ {i} y ^ {i} = N ^ {i} p ^ {i} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {C} c ^ {i j} T ^ {i j} = N ^ {i} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {C} c ^ {i j} p ^ {i j} = N ^ {i} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {C} \left(p ^ {i} T ^ {i j} / P ^ {j}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} Y ^ {j}, \tag {5.33}
$$

where the final equality makes use of (5.24) and  $\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{ij}}\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . Then substituting (5.31) into the final expression of (5.33), we obtain,

$$
\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} = \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \left(\mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} / \tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}. \tag {5.34}
$$

Summing this over  $i = 1, \ldots, C$ , we have,  $Y^w = \sum_{j=1}^{C} (T^{ij} / \widetilde{P}^i \widetilde{P}^j)^{1 - \sigma} Y^j$ , which is identical to (5.32) provided that  $T^{ij} = T^{ji}$ . QED

To see the usefulness of this result, substitute (5.31) into the gravity equation (5.26) to obtain:

$$
\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} = \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} = \left(\frac {\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}{\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {w}}}\right) \left(\frac {\mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma}. \tag {5.35}
$$

This is a remarkably simple equation, whereby bilateral trade between countries depends on their GDP's and also their implicit price indexes. Anderson and van Wincoop call  $\widetilde{\mathbf{P}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  "indexes of multilateral resistance," because they depend on the transport costs  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  in (5.32). These indexes are unobserved, but Anderson and van Wincoop argue that we can solve for them by using equation (5.32) in combination with a formula for the transportation costs such as (5.29').

Specifically, the estimation strategy of Anderson and van Wincoop is to move the GDP terms from the right to the left of (5.35), take logs and substitute (5.29) for the transportation costs, obtaining (without the constant term  $\mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{w}}$ ):

$$
\ln (\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} / \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) = \rho (1 - \sigma) \ln \mathrm {d} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} + (1 - \sigma) \tau^ {\mathrm {i j}} + \ln (\tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1} + \ln (\tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {\sigma - 1} + (1 - \sigma) \varepsilon_ {\mathrm {i j}}. \tag {5.36}
$$

The dependent variable on the left is bilateral trade relative to the product of GDP's. On the right we have distance between regions i and j, followed by all other border effects  $(1 - \sigma)\tau^{\mathrm{ij}}$ , and then the multilateral resistance terms  $(\widetilde{\mathbf{P}}^{\mathrm{i}})^{\sigma - 1}$ . These terms can be solved from (5.32)

once we know the transportation costs  $\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ji}}$ . The transport costs, in turn, are obtained from (5.29) using the estimated value of  $\rho(1 - \sigma)\ln \mathrm{d}^{\mathrm{ij}} + (1 - \sigma)\tau^{\mathrm{ij}}$ , which comes from (5.36). The estimation of this system must be custom programmed to minimize the sum of squared residuals in (5.36), while simultaneously using (5.29) to obtain the values of  $\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ji}}$  at each iteration, and with these, solving for the multilateral resistance terms  $(\widetilde{\mathrm{P}}^{\mathrm{i}})^{\sigma-1}$  from (5.32).

To perform this estimation, we need to be more specific about the form of the border effects  $(1 - \sigma)\tau^{ij}$  in (5.36). Recall that in McCallum's (1995) gravity equation in (5.20), we introduced an indicator variable  $\delta^{\mathrm{ij}}$  that equaled unity for trade between two Canadian provinces, and zero otherwise. Anderson and van Wincoop instead work with an indicator variable that is  $(1 - \delta^{\mathrm{ij}})$ , or unity for trade between the U.S. and Canada, and zero otherwise. Introducing the coefficient  $\gamma$  on this variable, we replace  $(1 - \sigma)\tau^{\mathrm{ij}}$  with  $\gamma(1 - \delta^{\mathrm{ij}})$  in (5.36) and also use the coefficient  $\alpha = \rho(1 - \sigma)$  on distance, to obtain:

$$
\ln \left(X ^ {i j} / Y ^ {i} Y ^ {j}\right) = \alpha \ln d ^ {i j} + \gamma \left(1 - \delta^ {i j}\right) + \ln \left(\widetilde {P} ^ {i}\right) ^ {\sigma - 1} + \ln \left(\widetilde {P} ^ {j}\right) ^ {\sigma - 1} + (1 - \sigma) \varepsilon_ {i j}. \tag {5.37}
$$

Their estimates of (5.37) are shown in column (4) of Table 5.2. Notice that the provincial and states GDP terms have their coefficients constrained at unity, since they have been brought to the left of (5.37). The coefficient on the indicator variable on cross-border trade in column (4) is estimated at  $\hat{\gamma} = -1.65$ . This can be compared to the estimates on the indicator variables for intra-Canada trade and intra-U.S. trade, in column (3), of 2.75 and 0.40, respectively. We certainly expect the indicator variables in columns (3) and (4) to have coefficients that are opposite in sign, since in the one case we are measuring intranational trade and in the other case

measuring international trade. It is noteworthy, however, that Anderson and van Wincoop's estimate in column (4) is roughly midway between the conventional gravity estimates in column (3), in absolute value. This appears to occur because Anderson and van Wincoop only allow a single indicator variable to measure cross-border trade, rather than distinguishing two indicator variables (i.e. one for Canadian exports to the U.S., and another for American exports to Canada). The use of a single indicator variable is related to their assumption that transport costs are symmetric,  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{ji}}$ .

How should we interpret the estimate  $\hat{\gamma} = -1.65$ ? One approach is to recall that  $(1 - \sigma)\tau^{\mathrm{ij}}$  was replaced by  $\gamma (1 - \delta^{\mathrm{ij}})$  in (5.37), so setting these equal and taking the exponent, we solve for  $\exp (\tau^{\mathrm{ij}}) = \exp [\gamma (1 - \delta^{\mathrm{ij}}) / (1 - \sigma)]$ . For cross-border trade we have  $\delta^{\mathrm{ij}} = 0$ , so  $\exp (\tau^{\mathrm{ij}}) = \exp [\gamma /(1 - \sigma)]$ . Taking values for the elasticity of substitution of  $\sigma = 5$ , 10 and 20, we would therefore obtain estimates of  $\exp (\tau^{\mathrm{ij}})$  of 1.5, 1.2, and 1.09, indicating border barriers of between  $9\%$  and  $50\%$  in terms of their implied effect on price. The upper end of these estimates is certainly high, but the lower end is not unreasonable.

We would like to turn the coefficient  $\hat{\gamma} = -1.65$  into an estimate of how much more trade there is within Canada as compared to across the border. For regressions (1)-(3) in Table 5.2, we simply took the exponent of the indicator coefficient, as reported near the bottom of the table. That approach is no longer appropriate, however, because if the border did not exist then the multilateral resistance terms in (5.37) would also be affected. Let us denote by  $(\overline{\mathbf{P}}^{\mathrm{i}})^{\sigma -1}$  the multilateral resistance terms in the absence of the border effect, i.e. what we obtain from formula (5.32), but now using only distance (times its estimated coefficient) to compute  $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  in (5.29).

Taking exponents of (5.37), and comparing this equation with and without border effects, the ratio of trade in these two cases is therefore, $^{12}$

$$
\frac {\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\overline {{\mathrm {X}}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}} = \left[ \mathrm {e} ^ {\hat {\gamma} (1 - \delta^ {\mathrm {i j}})} \right] \frac {\left(\tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}\right) ^ {\sigma - 1} \left(\tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {\sigma - 1}}{\left(\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}\right) ^ {\sigma - 1} \left(\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {\sigma - 1}}. \tag {5.38}
$$

For example, consider intra-Canadian trade, where  $\delta^{ij} = 1$  so the first term on the right of (5.38) vanishes. Anderson and van Wincoop find that (5.38) equals 4.3, meaning that intra-Canadian trade is 4.3 times larger with the border effects than without. $^{13}$  In addition, for the United States, Anderson and van Wincoop find that intra-U.S. trade is 1.05 times larger with the border effects than without. Finally, they find that cross-border trade is 0.41 times smaller with the border effects than without. All these numbers are computed from the ratio on the right of (5.38), averaged across the provinces or states in Canada or the U.S., as appropriate. With intra-Canadian trade being 4.3 times higher due to the border effect, and cross-border trade being 0.41 times smaller, it is immediate that intra-Canadian trade is  $4.3 / 0.41 = 10.5$  times higher than cross-border trade. This estimate is shown near the bottom of column (4) in Table 5.2, along with its standard error. The analogous calculation for the U.S. shows that intra-American trade is  $1.05 / 0.41 = 2.6$  times higher than cross-border trade, which is again shown at the bottom of column (4).

These estimates show how small economies, such as Canada, have a much larger impact of the border effects. This is consistent with our numerical example earlier in the chapter, and

indeed, the estimates of border effects obtained by Anderson and van Wincoop (10.5 and 2.6) are nearly the same as in our simple numerical example. Furthermore, these estimates have the following special property. The geometric mean of the border effects is  $(10.5\cdot 2.6)^{1 / 2} = 5.2$

Notice that this is the same as what we obtain by taking the exponent of the coefficient on the cross-border indicator variable (in absolute value),  $e^{1.65} = 5.2$ . So the geometric mean of the Canada and U.S. border effects, computing using formula (5.38), turns out to be identical to what we obtain by just using the cross-border indicator variable! This is no coincidence, and we provide a proof of this simple relation in the Appendix to this chapter. This result means that using cross-border indicator variable is a completely valid way to infer the average impact of the border on intranational relative to international trade.

# Using Fixed Effects

A drawback to the estimation strategy of Anderson and van Wincoop is that it requires custom programming to perform the constrained minimization (and obtain standard errors). A third and final approach to estimating the gravity equation, while using ordinary least squares, is to use fixed effects to take account of the unobserved price indexes. Fixed effects have been used in the gravity equation by a number of authors, including Harrigan (1996) and Hummels (1999), for example. Redding and Venables (2000) and Rose and van Wincoop (2001) give these fixed effects a structural interpretation, and we will summarize each of their results.

Since the multilateral indexes in (5.37) are unobserved, rather than calculating them according to (5.32), we could instead measure them as the coefficients of source and destination region fixed effects. That is, let  $\delta_1^i$  denote an indicator variable that is unity if region  $i$  is the

exporter, and zero otherwise; and let  $\delta_2^j$  denote an indicator variable that is unity if region  $j$  is the importer, and zero otherwise. Then the gravity equation in (5.37) can be re-written as:

$$
\ln \left(X ^ {i j} / Y ^ {i} Y ^ {j}\right) = \alpha \ln d ^ {i j} + \gamma (1 - \delta^ {i j}) + \beta_ {1} ^ {i} \delta_ {1} ^ {i} + \beta_ {2} ^ {i} \delta_ {2} ^ {i} + (1 - \sigma) \varepsilon_ {i j}, \tag {5.39}
$$

where the coefficients  $\beta_{1}^{i} = \ln (\widetilde{\mathbf{P}}^{i})^{\sigma -1}$  and  $\beta_{2}^{j} = \ln (\widetilde{\mathbf{P}}^{j})^{\sigma -1}$  on the source and destination indicator variables estimate the multilateral indexes.

An estimate of (5.39) for Canada-U.S. intranational and international trade is shown in column (5) of Table 5.2. Rather than the border estimate  $\hat{\gamma} = -1.65$  as in Anderson and van Wincoop (2001), we now obtain  $\hat{\gamma} = -1.55$ . Taking its exponential we obtain  $e^{1.55} = 4.7$ , as reported near the bottom of column 5. The value 4.7 is a consistent estimate of the average impact of the border barrier on Canada and U.S. trade relative to cross-border trade (as shown in the Appendix to this chapter). Notice that this estimate is nearly the same as the average border effect of 5.2 obtained by Anderson and van Wincoop (2001), who explicitly introduced the multilateral resistance term computed from (5.32) into the estimation. In contrast, the fixed effect approach estimates this terms as part of the regression without relying on formula (5.32). Both approaches give consistent estimates of the average border effect. While using the explicit multilateral resistance terms should result in more efficient estimates, this benefit seems to be relatively small compared to the computational simplicity of the fixed effect approach. Since the fixed effects method produces consistent estimates of the average border effect across countries, and is easy to implement, so it might be considered to be the preferred empirical method.

It is also interesting that the average border effect of 4.7 is nearly the same as the average effect obtained by a conventional gravity equation (like McCallum, 1995): in column (3) of Table 5.2, we compute the geometric mean of the border effect for Canada and the U.S. as 4.8. In contrast to columns (4) and (5), the estimates in column (1)-(3) are not consistent, because these regressions do not incorporate the price indexes. This appears to have the effect of overstating the border effect for Canada [15.7 in column (3) as compared to 10.5 in column (4)], and understating the effect for the United States [1.5 in column (3) as compared to 2.6 in column (4)]. Still, for this dataset, the geometric mean of these inconsistent estimates gives an average border effect that is very close to the consistent estimates in columns (4) and (5).

The fixed effect approach has been used by Rose and van Wincoop (2001) to estimate the impact of monetary unions on international trade. They include an indicator variable that is unity if the two countries belong to a monetary union, and interpret its coefficient of  $\hat{\gamma} = 0.86$  as a consistent estimate of the average impact of monetary unions on trade. This interpretation is valid (based on a multi-country extension of the Lemma in the Appendix). Surprisingly, they find that monetary unions increase trade by  $e^{\hat{\gamma}} = 2.36$ , or more than doubling trade on average between union members relative to non-union members. The actual mechanism by which monetary unions lead to such a large increase in trade remains quite unclear. Results like this have led Obstfeld and Rogoff (2001) to identify large border effects from the gravity equations as the cause of the "six major puzzles in international macroeconomics."

The fixed effect method has also been used by Redding and Venables (2000) to determine wages across countries. They do not rely on symmetric transportation costs, or the above theorem of Anderson and van Wincoop, but instead work directly from the gravity equation in (5.26). In their approach, the differentiated product is used as both consumer goods

and as intermediate inputs to production. Thus, proximity to trading partners affects a country's ability to export the differentiated good, and import the differentiated inputs: both of these activities will impact wages. Redding and Venables show the fixed effects of the gravity equation are directly related to equilibrium wages. In other words, the economic geography of a country – measured by its distance from and access to trading partners – determines its wages and hence its standard of living.

In the next section, we turn to another question of economic geography that has to do with the location of firms. Specifically, as we consider regions or countries of differing size, will the higher demand in large areas serve to attract more firms? Since each product is produced by only one firm in our model, asking about the location of firms is the same as asking about how many products  $\mathbf{N}^{\mathrm{i}}$  each country produces. We address this in the next section, using a simplified framework where wages are constant and equal across countries.

# The Home Market Effect

We will make the same assumptions on the differentiated good as in Krugman's original model: labor is the only input, and output  $\mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{i}}$  of the typical firm in country  $\mathrm{i}$  requires the labor input  $\mathbf{L}^{\mathrm{i}} = \alpha + \beta \mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . In addition, we will suppose that there is a homogeneous good, and one unit of that good requires one unit of labor. There are no transport costs in this good, so its price is equalized across countries.[14] Choosing the homogeneous good as the numeraire, and provided that each country produces that good under trade, wages are therefore unity in all countries. Having wages fixed will simplify our determination of  $\mathbf{N}^{\mathrm{i}}$ .

On the demand side, we assume that a fixed share of income  $\phi$  is spent on the differentiated product, which provides utility given by the CES function in (5.21) or (5.22). Therefore, demand for each differentiated product is still given by (5.25), but replacing income  $\mathbf{Y}^{\mathrm{j}}$  by the amount  $\phi \mathbf{L}^{\mathrm{j}}$  actually spent on the differentiated product, we obtain:

$$
c ^ {i j} = \left(p ^ {i j} / P ^ {j}\right) ^ {- \sigma} \phi L ^ {j} / P ^ {j}. \tag {5.40}
$$

The output of firms is still given by (5.30),  $y^{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{C} c^{ij} T^{ij}$ . Because of the CES utility function, this output will be fixed in a zero-profit equilibrium,  $\overline{y} = (\sigma - 1)\alpha / \beta$ , as obtained in (5.12). So in principle, the number of products in each country can be derived from the market clearing conditions:

$$
\bar {y} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {C} c ^ {i j} T ^ {i j}, \quad i = 1, \dots , C, \tag {5.41}
$$

where consumption depends on the price indexes  $\mathbf{P}^{\mathrm{j}}$  given by (5.25), which depend on the number of products.

Rather than solving for the number of products in each country, we will instead solve for the change in these as country size  $\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{j}}$  varies. The fact that the firm outputs are fixed on the left of (5.41) implies that some combination of the consumptions in each country must also be fixed, on the right. As a guess, let us suppose that consumption of every variety in each country is fixed. Under our framework where wages are equalized across countries, the prices  $\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{i}}$  and  $\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  are also fixed. Then we can totally differentiate (5.40) holding  $c^{\mathrm{ij}}$  fixed to obtain,

$$
0 = (\sigma - 1) \hat {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}} + \hat {\mathrm {L}} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \Rightarrow \hat {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}} = - \hat {\mathrm {L}} ^ {\mathrm {j}} / (\sigma - 1), \tag {5.42}
$$

where  $\hat{z} = \mathrm{dz} / z$  for any variable. Thus, price indexes in each country  $j$  will fall in direct proportion to the rise in country GDP. Recall from (5.25) that the price indexes depend on the number of products in each country. Thus, provided that there is a change in the number of products consistent with  $\hat{\mathbf{P}}^{\mathrm{j}}$  in (5.42), then our initial assumption that the consumption  $c^{\mathrm{ij}}$  are fixed is indeed correct.

To determine the change in the number of products, let us differentiate (5.25) to obtain,

$$
\hat {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}} = \left(\frac {1}{1 - \sigma}\right) \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \hat {\mathrm {N}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \phi^ {\mathrm {i j}}\right), \tag {5.43}
$$

where  $\phi^{\mathrm{ij}} = (\mathrm{N}^{\mathrm{ij}}\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{ij}}\mathrm{c}^{\mathrm{ij}}) / (\phi \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}})$  denotes the share of products from country i in the differentiated goods purchased by country j, with  $\sum_{\mathrm{i} = 1}^{\mathrm{C}}\phi^{\mathrm{ij}} = 1$ . Combining (5.42) and (5.43), we obtain an extremely simple relationship between the change in GDP of each country and the change in the number of products,

$$
\hat {\mathrm {L}} ^ {\mathrm {j}} = \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \hat {\mathrm {N}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \phi^ {\mathrm {i j}}. \tag {5.44}
$$

We can use (5.44) to solve for the change in number of product  $\hat{\mathbf{N}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  provided that the matrix of expenditure shares  $\Phi = [\phi^{\mathrm{ij}}]$  is invertible. This will be true, for example, if each country purchases a larger share of the differentiated product from itself than from other countries, so that  $\phi^{\mathrm{ij}} > \phi^{\mathrm{ij}}$  for  $\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}$ , as we shall assume.

When there are just two countries, we can express (5.44) in matrix notation as:

$$
(\hat {\mathrm {N}} ^ {1}, \hat {\mathrm {N}} ^ {2}) \left( \begin{array}{l l} \phi^ {1 1} & \phi^ {1 2} \\ \phi^ {2 1} & \phi^ {2 2} \end{array} \right) = (\hat {\mathrm {L}} _ {1}, \hat {\mathrm {L}} _ {2}) \Rightarrow (\hat {\mathrm {N}} _ {1}, \hat {\mathrm {N}} _ {2}) = \frac {(\hat {\mathrm {L}} _ {1} , \hat {\mathrm {L}} _ {2})}{| \Phi |} \left( \begin{array}{c c} \phi^ {2 2} & - \phi^ {1 2} \\ - \phi^ {2 1} & \phi^ {1 1} \end{array} \right) \tag {5.45}
$$

where  $|\Phi|$  denotes the determinant of the 2x2 matrix above. This determinant can be alternatively expressed as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left| \Phi \right| = \phi^ {1 1} \phi^ {2 2} - \phi^ {1 2} \phi^ {2 1} \\ = \phi^ {1 1} \left(1 - \phi^ {1 2}\right) - \phi^ {1 2} \left(1 - \phi^ {1 1}\right) \tag {5.46} \\ = \phi^ {1 1} - \phi^ {1 2} = \phi^ {2 2} - \phi^ {2 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

where we have repeatedly made use of the fact that  $\phi^{1j} + \phi^{2j} = 1$ , i.e. the consumption shares of products from both sources to country  $j$  sum to unity. This determinant is positive under our assumption that  $\phi^{jj} > \phi^{ij}$  for  $i \neq j$ .

To fix ideas, suppose that country 1 and 2 start off as identical, with equal transport costs between them. Similar to Krugman's model at the beginning of this chapter, trade between the identical countries will lead them to export equal numbers of the differentiated product to each other:  $\mathrm{N}^{1} = \mathrm{N}^{2}$  and trade is balanced in the differentiated good. Now suppose that the labor endowment of country 1 grows, with no change in country 2, so that  $\hat{\mathrm{L}}^{1} > 0$ , and  $\hat{\mathrm{L}}^{2} = 0$ . Then we can solve for the changing number of products from (5.45) and (5.46) as,

$$
\hat {\mathrm {N}} ^ {1} = \frac {\phi^ {2 2}}{\left(\phi^ {2 2} - \phi^ {2 1}\right)} \hat {\mathrm {L}} ^ {1} > \hat {\mathrm {L}} ^ {1} > 0 \quad \text {a n d} \quad \hat {\mathrm {N}} ^ {2} = \frac {- \phi^ {1 2}}{| \Phi |} <   0. \tag {5.47}
$$

Thus, the number of products in the larger country will grow by more than the increase in country size, while those in the smaller country will shrink. Because consumption  $c^{\mathrm{ij}}$  and prices

$\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  are both fixed, then exports  $\mathbf{X}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathbf{N}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{ij}}\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  from each country to the other will change in proportion to the number of products. Thus, with  $\mathbf{N}^{1}$  growing and  $\mathbf{N}^{2}$  falling, country 1 will become a net exporter of the differentiated good to country 2,  $\mathbf{X}^{21} > \mathbf{X}^{12}$  (where trade is balanced overall through flows of the homogeneous good). Summarizing these results, we have:

# Theorem (Krugman, 1980)

With two countries trading, the larger market will produce a greater number of products and be a net exporter of the differentiated good.

This result is known as the "home market effect," because it shows that a larger home market will attract disproportionately more firms, and therefore become a net exporter. This is quite different from what we expect in a model where the number of products  $\mathbf{N}^{\mathrm{i}}$  is constant: in that case, a larger market would have larger demand, and would therefore become a net importer of the good in question.[16]

Davis and Weinstein (1996, 1999) provide the most direct test of the "home market" effect, using industry level data for the OECD. They first measure "idiosyncratic" demand differences across countries, and then argue that having higher home demand should lead a country to be an exporter of a good if the "home market effect" operates.[17] They test this by regressing production of industries on the estimated demand differences across countries. In their pooled sample, they obtain an estimated coefficient of 1.6 on the demand differences,

indicating that having  $10\%$  greater demand for a production will lead to  $16\%$  additional production in that country, meaning that net exports will rise. This provides confirmation of the home market effect. When disaggregating across industries, they find that the impact of local demand on production exceeds unity in a majority of industries, though there are a few exceptions. When using data for Japanese industries locating in various prefectures, they find significant evidence of home market effects in about one-half of the industries, and these effects are economically large.

Head and Ries (2002) test for the home market effect between Canada and the United States. With only two countries, they need to rely on cross-industry or time series variation in the data, rather than the cross-country demand differences used by Davis and Weinstein. For the cross-industry regression they find a weak home market effect, but for the time series regression the home market effect is reversed (i.e. higher demand leads to imports rather than exports).

A similar reversal is found by Feenstra, Markusen and Rose (2001), when comparing cross-country trade in differentiated versus homogeneous products. $^{18}$  Estimating a conventional gravity equation, they find that the coefficient on exporter GDP exceeds unity, whereas the coefficient of the importer GDP is less than unity. Having the coefficient on exporter GDP exceed unity is like the comparative static effect reported in (5.47): the change in exports from country 1 to 2 is  $\hat{\mathbf{X}}^{12} = \hat{\mathbf{N}}^1 >\hat{\mathbf{L}}^1$ , so having higher country 1 income  $(\mathrm{L}^{1})$  leads to a magnified increase in exports. For the homogeneous products, however, this result is reversed and the exporter GDP has a coefficient smaller than importer GDP. The latter result is what we would

expect from a model where the number of products in each country is fixed, so that higher demand leads to net imports rather than net exports.

# Conclusions

This chapter has covered material in two topics – trade under monopolistic competition and the gravity equation – that are often linked though they need not be. As we have mentioned, the gravity equation arises quite naturally whenever countries are specialized in different goods. Such specialization is sometimes called “national product differentiation,” and cross-border trade in different varieties of a good is referred to as “intra-industry trade.” This occurs under the monopolistic competition model, but also occurs in other contexts, e.g. Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson’s (1977) Ricardian model with a continuum of goods, or their (1980) Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model where factor price are not equalized, as studied in chapter 3. Davis (1995) has combined Ricardian and HO elements to generate intra-industry trade in a model where product varieties have identical capital/labor ratios, but differ across countries by a Hicks-neutral productivity term.[19]

So while complete specialization in goods can arise in a number of contexts, the CES monopolistic competition model proves to be a convenient way to derive the gravity equation, especially when we allow for transport costs and other trade barriers. Unlike early work on the gravity equation that assumed identical prices across countries, once we introduce transportation costs or any other border barriers then prices must differ internationally, so we need to take account of the overall price indexes in each country. We have reviewed three methods to do so:

using published data on price indexes; using the computational method of Anderson and van Wincoop (2001); or using country fixed effects to measure the price indexes. The latter two methods were compared on a dataset dealing with trade between and within Canada and the United States. The fixed effects method produces consistent estimates of the average border effect across countries, and is simple to implement, so it might be considered to be the preferred empirical method.

The fact that the gravity equation works well empirically cannot be taken as evidence in support of the monopolistic competition model, however: it simply suggests that countries are specialized in different products, for whatever reason.[20] To really test whether trade patterns are due to monopolistic competition, we must look for hypotheses arising from this model that would not occur otherwise. One such hypothesis is the "home market effect," whereby firms tend to locate in the larger market due to higher profits available there. Under alternative explanations for national product differentiation, the home market effect need not occur: if the number of products  $\mathbf{N}^{\mathrm{i}}$  produced in each country is constant, then a larger market would have larger demand, and would therefore become a net importer of the good in question. So evidence of the home market effect, as found by Davis and Weinstein (1996, 1999) and more weakly by Feenstra, Markusen and Rose (2001) as well as Head and Ries (2002), lends support to the idea that monopolistic competition explains national product specialization.

An important area for further research is to test other hypotheses arising from that model. One direction to look is in the area of economic geography. An expanded discussion of that topic is beyond the scope of this book, but the reader is referred to Fujita, Krugman and

Venables (1999), who describe many results building on increasing returns to scale and the monopolistic competition model. For example, this literature suggests that proximity to markets will raise wages, and Redding and Venables (2000) apply this idea to estimate wages across countries based on the gravity equation. A similar approach can be used to determine wages across cities or regions within a country, as in Hanson (1997, 1998). In other empirical work, Davis and Weinstein (2001b) have used the location of economic activity in Japan, going from prehistoric times to war-time dislocations to the present day, to evaluate the importance of increasing returns versus alternative explanations for industry location.

Another direction to look for hypotheses is to loosen some of the assumptions of the monopolistic competition model. Two key assumptions are that firms are symmetric (their costs are all the same) and that they each produce a single product. Both of these assumptions are patently false: every industry has a wide range of firms of various efficiencies, and many of them produce multiple products. The theoretical difficulty with allowing for firms with differing efficiency is that the zero-profit condition of monopolistic competition will no longer apply: if the less-efficient firms earn zero profits, then the more-efficient firms will not. This difficulty has been resolved in different ways by Melitz (2002) and Yeaple (2002). In Melitz's model, firms have random productivities and earn zero expected profits, while in Yeaple's model, the workers in more efficient firms receive higher wages, so profits are still zero. Both of these models suggest empirical applications.

The assumption that firms in the monopolistic competition model each produce a single product has been weakened by Feenstra, Huang and Hamilton (2003). They motivate the idea of multi-product companies by the "business groups" that are found in many countries, such as the

keiretsu in Japan and the chaebol in South Korea. In their model, a business group chooses its range of upstream and downstream products to maximize profits, while free entry of groups ensures that profits are zero in equilibrium. They show that that having multi-product groups has a sharp implication for trade patterns: economies dominated by business groups will produce less product variety than with single-product firms.[22] This hypothesis can be tested by comparing two economies of similar size but with differing structure of business groups. For that purpose, Feenstra, Yang and Hamilton (1999) compare South Korea and Taiwan, where Korea has the large and strongly integrated chaebol, whereas Taiwan has much smaller business groups that are mainly located upstream. By comparing their sales of disaggregate products to the United States, it is strongly confirmed that Taiwan sells a greater product variety to the U.S. in nearly all industries than does Korea. Differences in the export patterns from South Korea and Taiwan are also observed by Martins (1992) and Rodrik (1993), who attribute this to the group structure in the two countries. Thus, the influence of business groups on the structure of trade, as predicted by a monopolistic competition with multi-product companies, is supported by this empirical evidence.

# Appendix: Using the Gravity Model to Measure Border Effects

The estimates of 10.5 for Canada and 2.6 for the U.S., shown in column (4) of Table 5.2, are Anderson and van Wincoop's (2001) "best" estimates of the impact of the Canada-U.S. border on intra-Canadian and intra-American trade relative to cross-border trade. These are unbiased estimates of the Canada-U.S. border effect, as opposed to the other estimates reported near the bottom of columns (1)-(3), which are biased because the price terms are omitted from the gravity equation. While the estimates of 10.5 and 2.6 require a complex calculation from (5.38), the geometric mean of these two values can be obtained very simply from the gravity equation, as indicated by the following result:

# Lemma

Let  $\hat{\gamma}$  denote the estimated coefficient of the border indicator in the gravity equation, and use (5.38) to compute the impact of the border on intranational trade relative to international trade, for each country. Then the geometric mean of the impact on each country equals  $\mathrm{e}^{-\hat{\gamma}}$ .

# Proof:

The multilateral resistance terms in (5.38) are obtained from (5.32) using the transportation costs  $\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}} = (\mathrm{d}^{\mathrm{ij}})^{\hat{\alpha}}\mathrm{e}^{\hat{\gamma}(1 - \delta^{\mathrm{ij}})}$  (i.e. including border effects) to compute  $(\widetilde{\mathrm{P}}^{\mathrm{i}})^{\sigma - 1}$ , while using  $\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}} = (\mathrm{d}^{\mathrm{ij}})^{\hat{\alpha}}$  (i.e. just distance) to compute  $(\overline{\mathrm{P}}^{\mathrm{i}})^{\sigma - 1}$ . Taking the geometric mean of trade  $\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  between Canadian provinces with border effects, and the predicted value  $\overline{\mathrm{X}}^{\mathrm{ij}}$  without border effects, we obtain from (5.38):

$$
\prod_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {C A}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\overline {{\mathrm {X}}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}\right) ^ {1 / \mathrm {N}} = \prod_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {C A}} \left(\frac {(\tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1} (\tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}{(\bar {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1} (\bar {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}\right) ^ {1 / \mathrm {N}}. \tag {5.48}
$$

With CA={1,...,10} Canadian provinces, they can each sell to 9 others, making N=90 bilateral flows in (5.38a). (Notice that we exclude i=j from the calculations in (5.48), since we are not considering sales by a province to itself.) In each of the bilateral flows, two indexes appear on the right, so there are a total of 180 multilateral indexes in the numerator and in the denominator of (5.48). Since each of the 10 provinces appears on the right of (5.48) an equal number of times, i.e.  $180/10 = 18$  times, this expression can be simplified as,

$$
\prod_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {C A}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\overline {{\mathrm {X}}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}\right) ^ {1 / \mathrm {N}} = \prod_ {\mathrm {i} \in \mathrm {C A}} \left(\frac {\left(\widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}\right) ^ {\sigma - 1}}{\left(\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}\right) ^ {\sigma - 1}}\right) ^ {1 / 5}, \tag {5.48'}
$$

where the exponent on the right is obtained as  $18 / 90 = 1 / 5$ .

Using the same approach for the U.S. = {1,...,30} American states in the sample, we can compute that average trade between them with and without border effects as,

$$
\prod_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {U S}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\overline {{\mathrm {X}}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}\right) ^ {1 / \mathrm {N}} = \prod_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {U S}} \left(\frac {(\widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1} (\widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}{(\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1} (\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}\right) ^ {1 / \mathrm {N}}. \tag {5.49}
$$

where now  $\mathrm{N} = 30 \cdot 29 = 860$ . Again, for each bilateral flow there are two multilateral indexes in the numerator and denominator on the right, so each of these indexes appears  $860 \cdot 2 = 1,720$  times. Since each of the 30 states appears on the right of (5.49) an equal number of times, i.e.  $1720 / 30 = 58$  times, this expression can be simplified as,

$$
\prod_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {U S}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\overline {{\mathrm {X}}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}\right) ^ {1 / \mathrm {N}} = \prod_ {\mathrm {i} \in \mathrm {U S}} \left(\frac {(\tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}{(\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}\right) ^ {1 / 1 5}, \tag {5.49'}
$$

where the exponent on the right is obtained as  $58 / 680 = 1 / 15$ .

Finally, consider the effects on cross-border trade. In this case  $\delta^{\mathrm{ij}} = 0$ , so the term  $(\mathrm{d}^{\mathrm{ij}})^{\hat{\alpha}}\mathrm{e}^{\hat{\gamma}(1 - \delta^{\mathrm{ij}})} = (\mathrm{d}^{\mathrm{ij}})^{\hat{\alpha}}\mathrm{e}^{\hat{\gamma}}$  appears in (5.38). The ratio of U.S.-to-Canada exports with the border effects and without is given by:

$$
\prod_ {\mathrm {i} \in \mathrm {U S}, \mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {C A}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\overline {{\mathrm {X}}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}\right) ^ {1 / \mathrm {N}} = \left[ \mathrm {e} ^ {\hat {\gamma} (1 - \delta^ {\mathrm {i j}})} \right] \prod_ {\mathrm {i} \in \mathrm {U S}, \mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {C A}} \left(\frac {(\widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1} (\widetilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}{(\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1} (\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}\right) ^ {1 / \mathrm {N}}. \tag {5.50}
$$

On the left side, we average the flow from the U.S. to Canada, so  $N = 30 \cdot 10 = 300$ . On the right side, each pair of state-provinces appears an equal number of times, which means that each province appears 30 times and each state appears 10 times. It follows that we can re-write this expression as:

$$
\prod_ {\mathrm {i} \in \mathrm {U S}, \mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {C A}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {X} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\overline {{\mathrm {X}}} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}\right) ^ {1 / \mathrm {N}} = \left(\mathrm {e} ^ {\hat {\gamma}}\right) \prod_ {\mathrm {i} \in \mathrm {U S}} \left(\frac {(\tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}{(\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}\right) ^ {1 / 3 0} \prod_ {\mathrm {j} \in \mathrm {C A}} \left(\frac {(\tilde {\mathrm {P}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}{(\overline {{\mathrm {P}}} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {\sigma - 1}}\right) ^ {1 / 1 0}, (5. 5 0 ^ {\prime})
$$

where the exponent on the U.S. multilateral indexes is obtained as  $10 / 300 = 1 / 30$ , and the exponent on the Canadian provinces is obtained as  $30 / 300 = 1 / 10$ .

We also need to compute the ratio of Canada-to-U.S. exports with the border effects and without, but this turns out to be identical to (5.50'). Then taking the geometric mean of (5.48') and (5.49'), and dividing by (5.50'), we obtain  $\mathrm{e}^{-\hat{\gamma}}$ . QED

# Problems

5.1 For the utility function in (5.1), with  $\mathrm{v}(0) = 0$ ,  $\mathrm{v}' > 0$ , and  $\mathrm{v}'' < 0$ , show that when the number of goods rises holding income fixed, the consumer is better off.
5.2 In Krugman's monopolistic competition model, suppose that the utility function takes on the CES form shown in (5.10), rewritten for simplicity with two goods as:

$$
\mathrm {U} \left(\mathrm {c} _ {1}, \mathrm {c} _ {2}\right) = \mathrm {c} _ {1} ^ {\theta} + \mathrm {c} _ {2} ^ {\theta}, \quad 0 <   \theta = (\sigma - 1) / \sigma <   1.
$$

5.3 Suppose that industry 1 is monopolistically competitive, with a CES sub-utility function as described in problem 5.2. We let the marginal costs be denoted by  $c_1(w,r)$ , and the fixed costs in the industry by  $\alpha c_1(w,r)$ . That is, the fixed costs use labor and capital in the same proportions as the marginal costs. Industry 2 is a competitive industry, and each industry uses labor and capital.

(a) Write down the relationship between the prices of goods and factor prices. Does the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem still apply?
(b) Write down the full-employment conditions for the two factors. Does the Rybczynski Theorem still apply in some form?

How are your answers to (a) and (b) affected if the fixed costs in industry 1 uses different proportions of labor and capital than the marginal costs?

5.4 Consider the translog expenditure function:

$$
\ln \mathrm {E} (\mathrm {p}, \mathrm {U}) = \ln \mathrm {U} + \mathrm {a} _ {0} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \mathrm {a} _ {\mathrm {i}} \ln \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {i}} + \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \mathrm {b} _ {\mathrm {i j}} \ln \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {i}} \ln \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {j}}, \tag {5.51}
$$

where:

$$
a _ {i} = 1 / N, b _ {i i} = - \gamma (N - 1) / N, a n d b _ {i j} = \gamma / N f o r i \neq j, w i t h i, j = 1, \dots , N, \tag {5.52}
$$

where  $\gamma > 0$ . Use this expenditure function to answer:

(a) Show that restrictions in (5.52) ensure that the expenditure function in (5.51) is homogeneous of degree one in prices;
(b) Derive the share of expenditure on good i by differentiating (5.51) with respect to  $\ln p_i$ ;
(c) Differentiate the share of each good with respect to  $\ln p_i$  to derive an expression for the elasticity of demand;
(d) Use the elasticity of demand to obtain an expression for the ratio of price to marginal cost for the firm. How will each firm's price depend on its competitor's prices?

Note that this expenditure function has been used by Bergin and Feenstra (2000, 2001).

# Empirical Exercises

In this exercise, you are asked to reproduce the empirical results shown in Table 5.2. There are four datasets available: “dist.csv” which is distances; “gdp_ce_93.csv” which is GDP in exporting location in 1993; “gdp_ci_93.csv” which is GDP in importing location in 1993; and “trade_93.csv” which is trade in 1993. To complete the exercise, these files should be stored in the directory: c:\Empirical_Exercise\Chapter_5\. After this, run the STATA program “data_trans.do,” which will convert these datasets to STATA files with the same name. The trade data is already converted into US dollars, but GDP data is in Canadian dollars, so this is converted with the exchange rate 1 Canadian dollar = 0.775134 U.S. dollars. Then do:

5.1 Run the program "gravity_1.do" to replicate the gravity equations in columns (1)-(3) of Table 5.2.

5.2 Run the program "gravity_2.do" to replicate gravity equation using fixed-effects, i.e., column (5) in Table 5.2. Then answer:

(a) How are these results affected if we allow the provincial and state GDP's to have coefficients different from unity?
(b) What coefficients are obtained if we introduce separate indicator variables for intra-Canadian and intra-U.S. trade, rather than the border dummy?
