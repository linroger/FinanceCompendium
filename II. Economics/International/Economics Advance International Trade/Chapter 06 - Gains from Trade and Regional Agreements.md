# Chapter 6: Gains from Trade and Regional Agreements

In earlier chapters we suggested that trade brings gains to a country, but at the same time, there are both winners and losers. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem made that especially clear. In the Heckscher-Ohlin model the abundant factor gains from trade (through the rise in the relative export price increasing the real return to that factor, used intensively in exports), while the scarce factor loses from trade (through the fall in the relative import price lowering the real return to that factor). Can we be sure that the gains always exceed the losses? That is the topic of this chapter.

We begin with a discussion of "lump sum transfers," whereby the government has the ability to tax the gainers and transfer income to the losers, without changing their behavior in the process. That is, the lump sum transfers are assumed to be non-distorting. We show that it is indeed possible to achieve Pareto gains from trade, i.e. a situation where everyone gains. This result is unrealistic, however, because any attempt by the government to achieve such a redistribution of income would lead people to change their behavior (so as to receive more transfers), and these effects are not taken into account.

As a second approach, we investigate a set of commodity and factor taxes/subsidies that has been proposed by Dixit and Norman (1980). By construction, this policy requires much less information than the lump-sum transfers, and any changes in individuals' behavior due to the tax/subsidies are fully taken into account. We show that this policy can also lead to a situation where everyone gains. There are still some assumptions needed to achieve this result, as we will discuss, but the policy is generally thought to be much more feasible than lump-sum transfers. Indeed, we provide an example from Akerlof et al (1991) where factor subsidies were proposed as a means to obtain Pareto gains from trade after the unification of Germany.

The use of lump-sum subsidies to achieve Pareto gains from trade can be readily extended to compare any two trading situations, and identify conditions under which the country in question is better off or not, as in Grinols and Wong (1991) and Ju and Krishna (2000a,b). Furthermore, the analysis can be extended to cover tariff reform by multiple countries. This is the goal of the World Trade Organization (WTO): to reduce barriers to trade among its member countries, which include more than 140 countries. Among the newest members are the People's Republic of China, accepted into the WTO on November 10, 2001, with Taiwan joining the next day. The WTO was known before 1994 as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and was set up after World War II along with other international institution such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The GATT has made great progress in reducing trade barriers worldwide through "rounds" of discussion, which included the Uruguay Round lasting from 1986-1994, and the agreement in Doha, Qatar, on November 14, 2001, to launch a new round of negotiations.

Some of the founding principles of GATT, known as articles, are displayed in Table 6.1. The most fundamental of these is the "most favored nation" (MFN) principle (see Article I), which states that all countries belonging to the GATT should be treated equally, i.e. if the U.S. reduces its tariffs on goods coming from Europe, it must do the same for those goods coming from any other member country. Such tariff reductions are called multilateral, and all the GATT rounds have been aimed at multilateral reductions in trade barriers.

There are instances, however, where a group of countries will decide to completely eliminate all tariffs between them, without eliminating tariffs on goods imported from the rest of the world. This is called a regional agreement or preferential agreement between the countries involved. In the case where this group of countries also unify their tariffs against the rest of

the world, with zero tariffs internally, this is called a customs union. The European Economic Community (EEC) is one example of a customs union, and another is MERCOSUR, established in 1995, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. In contrast, if the group of countries maintains their own tariffs against the rest of the world, with zero tariffs internally, then this is called a free trade area. Examples of free trade areas are the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) of 1989, which later led to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of 1994, which consists of Canada, the United States and Mexico. Both customs unions and free trade areas violate the MFN principle, since the countries within the union or area are treated differently from those outside. But such agreements are permitted under Article XXIV of the GATT, provided that “the duties [with outside parties] shall not on the whole be higher or more restrictive than the general incidence of the duties . . .prior to the formation.”

Because customs unions and free trade areas involve only partial elimination of tariffs, they can lead to unexpected results: as pointed out by Viner (1950), the countries left out of the union and even the countries inside the union can become worse off. We discuss this possibility at the end of the chapter, and identify conditions under which this outcome can be avoided, as in Kemp and Wan (1976). This also provides us with an important area for empirical research, i.e. measuring the gains and losses from preferential agreements, of which there have been an increasing number in recent years. We discuss several empirical studies: Grinols (1984) on Britain's membership in the EEC; Clausing (2001) and Romalis (2002) on trade creation and diversion due to CUSFTA and NAFTA; and Chang and Winters (2002) on the terms of trade effects of MERCOSUR. We conclude the chapter by extending the results to include imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale, and also discussing the welfare effects of regional agreements under these conditions.

# Lump Sum Transfers

Our discussion of lump sum transfers follows Dixit and Norman (1980, pp. 76-78). We want to distinguish the various consumers in the economy, so we index them by  $h = 1, \dots, H$ . We will suppose that individual  $h$  has the increasing and quasi-concave utility function  $u^h(c^h, v^h)$ , where  $c^h$  is the N-dimensional vector of consumption, and  $v^h$  is the M-dimensional vector of factor supplies. Under autarky, each consumer maximizes utility subject to the budget constraint,

$$
p ^ {a ^ {\prime}} c ^ {h a} \leq w ^ {a ^ {\prime}} v ^ {h a}, \tag {6.1}
$$

where  $\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{a}}$  is the autarky vector of commodity prices, and  $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{a}}$  is the autarky vector of factor prices. The resulting utility for each consumer is  $\mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{h}}(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{ha}},\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{ha}})$ .

Summing over all consumption and factor supplies, the total output in the economy is therefore  $\sum_{\mathrm{h} = 1}^{\mathrm{H}}\mathrm{c}^{\mathrm{ha}} = \mathrm{y}^{\mathrm{a}}$ , and the total factor inputs are  $\sum_{\mathrm{h} = 1}^{\mathrm{H}}\mathrm{v}^{\mathrm{ha}} = \mathrm{v}^{\mathrm{a}}$ . Of course, the point  $(\mathrm{y}^{\mathrm{a}},\mathrm{v}^{\mathrm{a}})$  must be feasible for producers, and also optimal at the prices  $(\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{a}},\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{a}})$ . We will assume that the technology for the economy is subject to constant returns to scale. This means that the payments to factors are exactly equal to the revenue collected, so that profits in the economy are,

$$
\mathrm {p ^ {a} \Delta y ^ {a} - w ^ {a} \Delta v ^ {a} = 0}.
$$

We now consider the free trade equilibrium, which includes a system of lump-sum taxes or transfers from the government to each individual. We will let  $\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{h}}$  denote the transfer to each individual h, so that  $\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{h}} < 0$  is a lump-sum tax. Then the total revenue collected by the

government is  $-\sum_{h=1}^{H} R^h$ , and we will need to establish that this is non-negative in order for this system of lump-sum transfers to be feasible.

Denote the equilibrium commodity and factor prices under free trade by  $(\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{w})$ . With each individual receiving the transfer  $\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{h}}$ , the budget constraint is:

$$
p ^ {\prime} c ^ {h} \leq w ^ {\prime} v ^ {h} + R ^ {h}. \tag {6.2}
$$

We want to choose a pattern of transfers that allows each individual to be as well off as they were in autarky. To this end, consider the following system:

$$
R ^ {h} = \left(p - p ^ {a}\right) ^ {\prime} c ^ {h a} - \left(w - w ^ {a}\right) ^ {\prime} v ^ {h a}. \tag {6.3}
$$

To interpret this, if a price for a commodity rises going from autarky to free trade, the government will subsidize each individual by the price rise times their autarky consumption. Conversely, if the earnings of a factor rises going from autarky to free trade, the government will tax each individual by the wage increase times their autarky factor supply. The goal of this transfer system is to ensure that all individuals can still afford their autarky choices  $(\mathrm{c}^{\mathrm{ha}}, \mathrm{v}^{\mathrm{ha}})$ . To see that this is indeed the case, substitute these autarky choices into the budget constraint (6.2), and make use of (6.3), to obtain:

$$
\mathrm {p ^ {\prime} c ^ {h a}} \leq \mathrm {w ^ {\prime} v ^ {h a}} + (\mathrm {p - p ^ {a}}) ^ {\prime} \mathrm {c ^ {h a}} - (\mathrm {w - w ^ {a}}) ^ {\prime} \mathrm {v ^ {h a}} \iff \mathrm {p ^ {h a}} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {c ^ {h a}} \leq \mathrm {w ^ {a}} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {v ^ {h a}}.
$$

Since the second equation above is just the individual's autarky budget constraint in (6.1), we know that it is satisfied. This proves that the autarky choices  $(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{ha}},\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{ha}})$  are feasible for the budget constraint in (6.2) and transfers in (6.3).

This result can also be seen from Figure 6.1. We illustrate there the indifference curves for an individual choosing between a single consumption good  $c^h$  and a single factor supply  $v^h$ . Under autarky the budget constraint is  $p^a c^h \leq w^a v^h$ , or  $c^h \leq (w^a / p^a) v^h$ , as shown by the line through the origin with slope  $(w^a / p^a)$ , and the individual chooses point A. Suppose that the free trade prices lead to a decline in the real wage,  $(w/p) < (w^a / p^a)$ . Then in order to ensure that the consumer can still afford point A, the government would transfer the amount  $R/p$  in terms of the consumption good, leading to the budget constraint starting at that point and rising with slope  $(w/p)$ . On this budget constraint the individual can still afford point A, but would prefer to consume at point B. This illustrates the consumer gains available using the lump-sum transfers described in (6.3).

Let us now sum up the transfers, and reverse its sign, to obtain total government revenue:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} R ^ {h} = (p ^ {a} - p) ^ {\prime} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} c ^ {h a} - (w ^ {a} - w) ^ {\prime} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} v ^ {h a} \\ = \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {a}} - \mathrm {p}\right) ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {a}} - \left(\mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {a}} - \mathrm {w}\right) ^ {\prime} \mathrm {v} ^ {\mathrm {a}} \\ = \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {a} ^ {\prime}} \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {a}} - \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {a} ^ {\prime}} \mathrm {v} ^ {\mathrm {a}}\right) - \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {a}} - \mathrm {w} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {v} ^ {\mathrm {a}}\right) \\ = - \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {a}} - \mathrm {w} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {v} ^ {\mathrm {a}}\right) \\ \geq - \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} - \mathrm {w} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {v}\right) = 0, \tag {6.4} \\ \end{array}
$$

where the second line follows by using  $\sum_{h=1}^{H} c^{ha} = y^a$  and  $\sum_{h=1}^{H} v^{ha} = v^a$ , the third line follows by rearranging terms, and the fourth line follows because autarky profits are zero as in (6.2). The expression  $(p' y^a - w' v^a)$  in the fourth line shows the value of profits under free trade if producers chose the feasible but non-optimal point  $(y^a, v^a)$ , which will be less than profits at

the optimal point  $(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{v})$ , and these profits are zero from constant returns to scale. This establishes the final line.

Therefore, we see that  $-\sum_{h=1}^{H} R^h \geq 0$ , so this system does not cost the government anything: the lump-sum taxes collected from those gaining from trade are more than enough to cover the losses to those harmed by trade. No one is harmed by the move to free trade, and there will generally be gains of two sorts: the consumption gains shown in Figure 6.1 from consuming at a point different from autarky; and the efficiency gains that arise when the value of output ( $p'y - w'v$ ) is strictly greater than ( $p'y^a - w'v^a$ ), so that the inequality on the last line of (6.4) is strict. To understand this source of gains, consider a special case where the factor supplies chosen by consumers do not change, so that the total factor inputs  $\overline{v}$  are fixed. Then we have that  $w'v^a = w' \overline{v} = p'y$ , so that the revenue collected by the government in (6.4) is:

$$
- \sum_ {\mathrm {h} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {H}} \mathrm {R} ^ {\mathrm {h}} = - \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {a}} - \mathrm {w} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {v} ^ {\mathrm {a}}\right) = \mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} - \mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {a}}. \tag {6.4'}
$$

In Figure 6.2, for example, suppose that the autarky equilibrium is at point A and the free trade production point at B. Then the revenue collected by the government is exactly the difference between the value of production at these points (with prices p), or the difference between the two budget lines that are drawn. With this revenue given back to consumers, they enjoy gains for that reason in addition to the consumption gains illustrated in Figure 6.1.

As appealing as these results on Pareto gains from trade are, the idea of using lump-sum transfers is not realistic because this policy requires too much information to implement. This can be seen from (6.3), where the transfers require knowledge of each individual's autarky consumption and factor supplies. Suppose that the government announced a plan to collect this

information using a survey, and then implement the transfers in (6.3). Given knowledge of the formula used in (6.3), people would then have an incentive to change their consumptions and factor supplies so as to have more beneficial values of  $(\mathrm{c}^{\mathrm{ha}}, \mathrm{v}^{\mathrm{ha}})$  recorded in the survey, and therefore get more transfers, thereby leading to a government budget deficit. This is an example of an incentive compatibility problem: the attempt to implement a policy would lead individuals to not truthfully report the information needed.

There are two possible solutions to such a problem. The first, which we describe next, is to use policy instruments that do not require individual information. A second solution is to build into the policy itself an incentive for people to tell the truth. The transfers in (6.3) certainly will not do this: everyone would claim that they had consumed more of goods whose prices increased from autarky to trade, and supplied more of factors whose wages fell. But perhaps there is some other system of transfers that would lead to truthful reporting of individual information, and is therefore incentive compatible, while at the same time leading to Pareto gains. This topic is explored in Feenstra, McMillan and Lewis (1990), Feenstra and Lewis (1991a) and Facchini and Willmann (1999), but is beyond the scope of the present chapter.

# Commodity Taxes and Subsidies

Dixit and Norman (1980, pp. 79-80) and Dixit (1986) have proposed a system of commodity taxes and subsidies that are designed to achieve Pareto gains from trade, without requiring individual information (or at least, requiring much less information). Specifically, their idea is to allow good and factor prices for producers to move to their free trade levels, but hold good and factor prices for consumers fixed at their autarky levels. Let us denote the autarky prices by  $(\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{a}},\mathfrak{w}^{\mathrm{a}})$  and the equilibrium prices with free trade (and the commodity tax/subsidies in place) by  $(\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{w})$ . We let firms face these free trade prices, and set the vector of consumer taxes

on goods at  $(\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{a}} - \mathfrak{p})$ , and the vector of consumer subsidies on factors at  $(\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{a}} - \mathbf{w})$ . It follows that consumers face the price vector  $(\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{a}}, \mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{a}})$ , which is the same as in autarky. Therefore, they would make exactly the same decisions as in autarky, and achieve their autarky utility  $\mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{h}}(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{ha}}, \mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{ha}})$ .

Next, we check the government budget. The revenue collected from this system of commodity taxes and subsidies equals:

$$
\left(p ^ {a} - p\right) ^ {\prime} \sum_ {h = i} ^ {H} c ^ {h a} - \left(w ^ {a} - w\right) ^ {\prime} \sum_ {h = i} ^ {H} v ^ {h a} = \left(p ^ {a} - p\right) ^ {\prime} y ^ {a} - \left(w ^ {a} - w\right) ^ {\prime} v ^ {a}. \tag {6.5}
$$

Notice that this is identical to the expression in (6.4), and is therefore non-negative for exactly the same reasons. As we discussed in (6.4') and Figure 6.2, this expression is strictly positive whenever there are efficiency gains from having producers face free trade rather than autarky prices. If this is the case, then the government redistributes this revenue back to consumers as a "poll subsidy" (i.e. an equal amount to each person). In that way, all consumers receive more than their autarky utility level, and Pareto gains from trade are achieved!

This system of commodity taxes and subsidies just requires information on the goods and factor prices  $(\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{a}},\mathfrak{w}^{\mathrm{a}})$  and  $(\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{w})$ , which is obviously much less than required to compute the lump-sum transfers in (6.3). On the other hand, it should not be thought that the factor price information is always available. If we can think of the quantity of a factor supplied as measuring effort rather than just hours worked, then the factor prices need to be measured per unit of effort. If effort is not observed, then neither are the true prices or factor supplies. To state this problem differently, a worker who was guaranteed his autarky wage even when trade is opened would no longer have an incentive to work hard. Thus, there is again an incentive compatibility problem

related to the collection of factor prices whenever individual's effort cannot be observed. A similar problem occurs for workers paid annual salaries rather than wages, so that we observe their income  $\mathsf{w}\mathsf{v}^{\mathsf{h}}$  rather than wages w. In this case, we would have to infer their factor supply (or effort level)  $\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h}}$  before knowing their wage w.

A second potential difficulty with this system of commodity taxes and subsidies occurs when individuals have moving costs. To model this, suppose that the vector of factor supplies  $\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h}}$  appearing in the utility function is indexed by the location where the individual works. That is, if the economy has M primary factors and L locations, the vector  $\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h}}$  is of dimension LM rather than M. An individual who is indifferent between working in one location versus the other would have indifference curves that are linear between these two factor supplies: when offered a wage slightly higher in one location, the individual would shift entirely there. But if instead the utility function  $\mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{h}}(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{h}},\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h}})$  is strictly quasi-concave, then this individual would not be willing to shift between locations when wages are unchanged. This formulation is a simple way to capture the idea that individuals have preferences over where to work and psychic costs to relocating. Notice that it is still consistent with the Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium model, which allows goods or factor to be indexed by location.

What are the implications of this for the system of commodity tax and subsidies proposed by Dixit and Norman (1980)? Suppose that we use the factor subsidies to bring all individuals

back to their autarky factor prices. Since  $\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h}}$  is indexed by location, and  $\mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{h}}(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{h}}, \mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h}})$  is strictly quasi-concave, this means that individuals have a unique choice of where to work, and are unwilling to shift between locations at the autarky wages. Assume that the various goods in the economy are produced at different locations. Then opening the economy up to trade, but holding wages fixed at  $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{a}}$ , means that it is impossible for the economy to shift from a point like A to point B in Figure 6.2: if workers are unwilling to move between industry/locations at constant wages, the economy will be stuck at point A despite the change in producer prices. It is appropriate to think of the preferences over locations, combined with wages fixed at their autarky level, as introducing a "kink" into the production possibility frontier at point A, as illustrated by the dashed lines in Figure 6.2. Because production no longer changes in response to the free trade prices, there are no efficiency gains and government revenue in (6.5) is zero. In this case, the scheme of commodity tax/subsidies proposed by Dixit and Norman fail to achieve any gains.

Feenstra and Lewis (1994) have investigated this case, and argue that moving subsidies can restore Pareto gains through subsidizing workers to move between industry/locations. An example of such subsidies in the United States is Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). As described in Richardson (1982), this program was established in the United States under the Trade Act of 1974 to compensate workers in industries that experienced unemployment due to import competition. It was used heavily by auto workers during the U.S. recession of the early 1980s, for example. However, it has often been the case that workers using this program have not shifted into new jobs, but instead used TAA as an income supplement during their period of unemployment (see the evidence in Aho and Bayard, 1984). This was especially true for the automobile workers laid off in Detroit in 1979 and 1980: many of them simply collected the

TAA benefits and when the automobile industry recovered, they returned to their former jobs. Findings such as this eventually led the U.S. Congress to realize that the program was not encouraging relocation of workers, and its funding was cut drastically. A much smaller TAA program was later implemented along with NAFTA in 1994, and this program requires job retraining (see Irwin, 2002, pp. 106-110).

There is some theoretical validity to the idea that a TAA program is worthwhile only if it leads to the relocation of workers between industries. In terms of Figure 6.2, the economy achieves production gains of going from point A to point B only if workers are willing to move between industry/locations: simply giving income supplements to workers but having production remain at point A cannot be a self-financing policy. Furthermore, it is essential that workers move in the "right" direction, i.e. towards those industries whose international prices have increased, or from point A to point B in Figure 6.2. Feenstra and Lewis (1994) show how a program of moving subsidies can be designed to achieve this goal, so that in conjunction with the commodity taxes proposed by Dixit and Norman, the program achieves Pareto gains and is self-financing.

As a final example of how the commodity tax/subsidies proposed by Dixit and Norman relate to actual policies, consider the case of the unification of East and West Germany. As described by Akerlof, et al (1991, p. 1): “At midnight on June 30, 1990, German economic, monetary, and social union occurred: the mark of the German Democratic Republic [East Germany] was replaced by the deutsche mark; trade barriers were lifted; legal, tax, and social

insurance system were harmonized; and all existing barriers to capital and labor movement were removed." The replacement of the mark with the deutsche mark at par, and the pressure from labor unions to achieve wage parity between the East and West, meant that companies in former East Germany were faced with wages that were far above their market levels. Indeed, Akerlof, et al (1991) estimate that only  $8\%$  of former East German conglomerates would have been profitable at those high wages. In the absence of government intervention, it could be expected that wages in the industries located in Eastern Germany would have fallen dramatically, and in the absence of this, severe bankruptcy and unemployment would result.

The government supported the increase of wages in the East to the level of those in the West in order to avoid migration out of the East. Thus, not only did government policies explicitly allow workers in former Eastern Germany to maintain their standard of living from unification, these policies encouraged an increase in living standards (to the level of Western wages) in order to avoid migration. At the same time, it was expected that workers in former West Germany should not be harmed by unification. This historical episode is therefore a perfect example of an attempt to achieve Pareto gains from trade in practice.

How could such gains be achieved in the face of non-market clearing wages in East Germany, combined with unemployment? The answer proposed by Akerlof, et al (1991, p. 4) is that "flexible employment bonuses" or wage subsidies should be used in the East:

So far...the package of policies that has been enacted fails to deal realistically with the questions of how to preserve existing jobs, how to speed new job creation, and how to make existing companies viable enough to be privatized. The major problem is that wages in the East are too high for most former state-owned enterprises to cover their costs. High wage also deter new investment. This creates an obvious need for governmental measures to close the gap between the high private cost of labor, caused by

high Eastern wages, and the low marginal product of labor, caused by outmoded capital and technology. We propose a program of self-eliminating flexible employment bonuses... to eliminate this gap. Our analysis shows that such a program would give many workers a chance to keep their jobs and would also raise the level of new job creation through faster private investment. According to our estimates, even deep wage subsidies (for example, an employment bonus equal to 75 percent of current wages) would have very low budgetary costs. They might even reduce the budget deficits – largely for the same reason that infrastructure investment is not costly: the government is already committed to a high level of income support even if workers are unemployed.

Thus, by subsidizing workers in East Germany the government could save enough income from unemployment benefits that the policy could be self-financing. This is very similar to the commodity tax/subsidies proposed by Dixit and Norman (1980), and shows how wage subsidies have an potentially important role to play in an actual attempt to achieve Pareto gains from trade.

# Partial Reform of Tariffs

We now consider a country that undertakes a partial reform of its tariff structure, moving from one situation of restricted trade (possible autarky) to another. This is a very realistic example, since countries undertake partial reform of their tariff frequently (though it is often done in conjunction with tariff reforms abroad). The question is: are individuals better off in this country or not? To answer this, we make use of the lump-sum transfers as a means to compensate individuals for this move, so we will need to check whether the government budget constraint allows this compensation or not. While the use of lump-sum transfers is not realistic,

the reader should think of this as simply a method to evaluate the desirability of the tariff reform, i.e., if the tariff reform combined with lump-sum transfers could make everyone better off, then we accept the tariff reform itself as a worthwhile policy, even when the transfers are not made. This criterion for evaluating a reform is called the "compensation principle" (see Chipman, 1987). Our analysis will follow that in Grinols and Wong (1991), and also Ju and Krishna (2000a), though the latter authors also show how the results can be extended to non-lump-sum transfers, using commodity tax and subsidies as in Dixit and Norman (1980) and Dixit (1986).

To set up our notation, let the domestic price vector for consumers and producers be denoted by  $p = p^* + t$ , where  $p^*$  is the vector of world prices, and  $t$  is the vector of trade taxes and subsidies. Notice that  $t_i > 0$  for an imported good indicates a tariff (raising the domestic price above the world price), whereas  $t_i < 0$  for an imported good indicates a subsidy.

Conversely,  $t_i > 0$  for an exported good indicates a subsidy (since firms receive  $p_i^* + t_i$  from exporting, the domestic price would also have to rise by the same amount), while  $t_i < 0$  for an exported good indicates a tax. It follows that the total revenue collected by the government from the trade tax/subsidies is  $t'(c - y)$ , where  $c = \sum_{h=1}^{H} c^h$  is total consumption and  $y$  is the output of the economy at the prices  $p$ . For convenience, let us denote the import vector as  $m = c - y$ , so that revenue collected is simply  $t'm$ .

We compare two different trade tax/subsidies  $\mathfrak{t}^0$  and  $\mathfrak{t}^1$ , with the equilibrium domestic price vectors  $\mathfrak{p}^0 = \mathfrak{p}^{*0} + \mathfrak{t}^0$  and  $\mathfrak{p}^1 = \mathfrak{p}^{*1} + \mathfrak{t}^1$ . We stress that the world price  $\mathfrak{p}^*$  changes in these two situations, and in general, these are endogenously determined by the tariffs chosen at home.

More generally, our setup allows for a change in tariffs abroad simultaneously with those at home, as part of a bilateral or multilateral tariff reform.

Our argument will follow the earlier discussion of lump-sum compensation quite closely. In the initial situation, we suppose that consumers maximize utility subject to their budget constraints,

$$
p ^ {0} \mathrm {c} ^ {\mathrm {h} 0} \leq w ^ {0} \mathrm {v} ^ {\mathrm {h} 0} + \left(t ^ {0} \mathrm {m} ^ {0}\right) / H, \tag {6.6}
$$

where  $\mathfrak{p}^0$  is the autarky vector of commodity prices,  $\mathbf{w}^{0}$  is the autarky vector of factor prices, and we include the redistributed tariff revenue  $t^{0},\mathrm{m}^{0} / \mathrm{H}$ , where  $\mathrm{H}$  is the number of consumers. The resulting utility for each consumer is  $\mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{h}}(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{h0}},\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h0}})$ .

Summing over all consumption and factor supplies, the total consumption in the economy is therefore  $\sum_{\mathrm{h} = 1}^{\mathrm{H}}\mathrm{c}^{\mathrm{h}0} = \mathrm{c}^{0}$ , and the total factor inputs are  $\sum_{\mathrm{h} = 1}^{\mathrm{H}}\mathrm{v}^{\mathrm{h}0} = \mathrm{v}^{0}$ . Firms will be maximizing profits at the equilibrium prices  $(\mathfrak{p}^{0},\mathfrak{w}^{0})$ , resulting in the outputs  $\mathbf{y}^{0}$  and factor demands  $\mathbf{v}^{0}$ . Again, we assume constant returns to scale so that the resulting profits are zero,  $\mathbf{p}^{0},\mathbf{y}^{0} - \mathbf{w}^{0},\mathbf{v}^{0} = 0$ . Imports in this equilibrium are  $\mathbf{m}^{0} = \mathbf{c}^{0} - \mathbf{y}^{0}$ , so the revenue collected is  $\mathbf{t}^{0},\mathbf{m}^{0}$ , which has been transferred back to consumers in (6.6).

After the tariff reform, domestic prices change to  $p^1 = p^{*1} + t^1$ , and the revenue collected from the trade tax/subsidies becomes  $t^{1'}m^1$ . We denote the transfer to consumers by  $R^h$ , which may differ from just the revenue  $t^{1'}m^1$ . The budget constraint for consumers is,

$$
p ^ {1} \mathrm {c} ^ {\mathrm {h}} \leq w ^ {1} \mathrm {v} ^ {\mathrm {h}} + R ^ {\mathrm {h}}. \tag {6.7}
$$

Our goal is to identify conditions under which the government can compensate individuals for the change in prices, and at the same time, balance the government budget. Using a similar system of lump-sum transfers that we considered earlier, this can be achieved by:

# Theorem (Grinols and Wong, 1991; Ju and Krishna, 2000a)

When the prices change from  $\mathbf{p}^0 = \mathbf{p}^{*0} + \mathbf{t}^0$  to  $\mathbf{p}^1 = \mathbf{p}^{*1} + \mathbf{t}^1$ , suppose that the government transfers the following amount to each individual:

$$
R ^ {h} = \left(p ^ {1} - p ^ {0}\right) ^ {\prime} c ^ {h 0} - \left(w ^ {1} - w ^ {0}\right) ^ {\prime} v ^ {h 0} + \left(t ^ {0}, m ^ {0}\right) / H. \tag {6.8}
$$

Provided that  $(\mathfrak{p}^{*0} - \mathfrak{p}^{*1})'\mathfrak{m}^0 +\mathfrak{t}^{1'}(\mathfrak{m}^1 -\mathfrak{m}^0)\geq 0$ , then no individual is worse off and the government budget is balanced.

# Proof:

Substituting the transfers in (6.8) into individual's budget constraint (6.7), we can confirm that the initial choices  $(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{h0}},\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h0}})$  are still feasible:

$$
p ^ {1} \mathrm {c} ^ {\mathrm {h} 0} \leq w ^ {1} \mathrm {v} ^ {\mathrm {h} 0} + \left(p ^ {1} - p ^ {0}\right) ^ {\prime} c ^ {\mathrm {h} 0} - \left(w ^ {1} - w ^ {0}\right) ^ {\prime} v ^ {\mathrm {h} 0} + \left(t ^ {0}, m ^ {0}\right) / H \tag {6.9}
$$

$$
\Leftrightarrow \mathrm {p} ^ {0} \mathrm {c} ^ {\mathrm {h} 0} \leq \mathrm {w} ^ {0,} \mathrm {v} ^ {\mathrm {h} 0} + (\mathrm {t} ^ {0,} \mathrm {m} ^ {0}) / \mathrm {H}.
$$

Since the second equation shown is just the initial budget constraint in (6.6), the initial choices  $(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{h0}},\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h0}})$  are feasible and utility is at least  $\mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{h}}(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{h0}},\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{h0}})$ .

To check the government budget, we subtract the transfers from the tariff revenue, obtaining,

$$
\begin{array}{l} t ^ {1} \cdot m ^ {1} - \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} R ^ {h} = t ^ {1} \cdot m ^ {1} - (p ^ {1} - p ^ {0}) ^ {\prime} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} c ^ {h 0} + (w ^ {1} - w ^ {0}) ^ {\prime} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} v ^ {h 0} - t ^ {0} \cdot m ^ {0} \\ = \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {0} - \mathrm {p} ^ {1}\right) ^ {\prime} \mathrm {c} ^ {0} - \left(\mathrm {w} ^ {0} - \mathrm {w} ^ {1}\right) ^ {\prime} \mathrm {v} ^ {0} + \mathrm {t} ^ {1}, \mathrm {m} ^ {1} - \mathrm {t} ^ {0}, \mathrm {m} ^ {0} \\ = \left(p ^ {0} - p ^ {1}\right) ^ {\prime} y ^ {0} - \left(w ^ {0} - w ^ {1}\right) ^ {\prime} v ^ {0} + \left(p ^ {0} - p ^ {1}\right) ^ {\prime} m ^ {0} + t ^ {1}, m ^ {1} - t ^ {0}, m ^ {0} \\ = \left(p ^ {0}, y ^ {0} - w ^ {0}, v ^ {0}\right) - \left(p ^ {1}, y ^ {0} - w ^ {1}, v ^ {0}\right) + \left(p ^ {* 0} - p ^ {* 1}\right) ^ {\prime} m ^ {0} + t ^ {1}, \left(m ^ {1} - m ^ {0}\right) \\ \geq \left(p ^ {* 0} - p ^ {* 1}\right) ^ {\prime} m ^ {0} + t ^ {1 \prime} \left(m ^ {1} - m ^ {0}\right). \tag {6.10} \\ \end{array}
$$

The second, third and fourth lines follow from simple algebra, and the inequality on the final line follows because initial profits  $(\mathfrak{p}^{0}\mathfrak{y}^{0} - \mathfrak{w}^{0}\mathfrak{v}^{0})$  are zero, while  $(\mathfrak{p}^{1}\mathfrak{y}^{0} - \mathfrak{w}^{1}\mathfrak{v}^{0})$  is less than  $(\mathfrak{p}^{1}\mathfrak{y}^{1} - \mathfrak{w}^{1}\mathfrak{v}^{1})$  which is also zero. Provided that the final line of (6.10) is non-negative, then so is the government budget. QED

This theorem provides us with two expressions that summarize the welfare impact of tariff reforms. The first of these is  $(\mathfrak{p}^{*0} - \mathfrak{p}^{*1})'\mathfrak{m}^0$ , which indicates the impact of the reform on the terms of trade, or international prices: if the price of imports goes up or the price of exports goes down, this expression will be negative and gains cannot be assured. The second term is  $\mathfrak{t}^{1'}(\mathfrak{m}^1 - \mathfrak{m}^0)$ , which is interpreted as the change in imports evaluated at the final tariff vector. The tariff vector reflects the difference between domestic and international prices: if positive, that indicates that marginal costs at home exceed international prices, so it would be more efficient for the country to import the good; and if it is negative, the country should be exporting the good. Therefore the term  $\mathfrak{t}^{1'}(\mathfrak{m}^1 - \mathfrak{m}^0)$  gives a measure of the efficiency gain (if positive) by

attracting imports towards the highest-tariff sectors, or loss (if negative). Thus, policies to raise welfare must avoid adverse terms of trade or efficiency effects to ensure Pareto gains.

Notice that the term  $t^{1'}(m^1 - m^0)$  can also be interpreted as the change in tariff revenue evaluating at the final tariff vector. In some cases, this will equal the overall change in tariff revenue. For example, suppose that a small country starts with prohibitive tariffs on some goods, and then moves to free trade in those goods. Since they have zero tariff revenue before and after the change, the term  $t^{1'}(m^1 - m^0)$  shows what happens to revenue collected on the other goods, whose tariffs are unchanged. If tariff revenue falls, then we cannot be sure that the country gained from the partial movement towards free trade. Working with a one-consumer small economy, Ohyama (1972) was the first to identify the sufficient condition that tariff revenue (evaluated at the final tariff vector) must rise to ensure gains.

Two special cases of the above theorem can be noted:

# Corollary

Applying the transfers to individuals as in (6.8):

(a) Starting in autarky and moving to trade with tariffs and subsidies makes no one worse off provided that  $t^{1'} \mathbf{m}^1 \geq 0$ ;
(b) For small country with constant world prices,  $\mathfrak{p}^{*0} = \mathfrak{p}^{*1}$ , a change in tariffs and subsidies makes no one worse off provided that  $t^{1'}(m^1 - m^0) \geq 0$ .

In the first case, we set  $\mathfrak{m}^0 = 0$  in the above theorem, and see that the criterion to achieve Pareto gains is just  $t^{1'}\mathfrak{m}^{1} \geq 0$ , i.e. the tariffs and subsidies must raise non-negative revenue. Ohyama (1972) described this condition as "self-financing" tariffs. The result in Corollary (a) is

interpreted as saying that “some trade is better than no trade.” If we suppose that the second situation has free trade,  $t^1 = 0$ , then the condition in Corollary (a) is clearly satisfied and this result is interpreted as “free trade is better than autarky” (Samuelson, 1962; Kemp, 1962). Corollary (b) considers a “small country,” facing fixed world prices, and shows that a tariff reform will raise welfare provided that the efficiency effects are non-negative. Again, if we suppose that the second situation has free trade,  $t^1 = 0$ , then the condition in Corollary (b) is clearly satisfied and this result can be interpreted as “free trade is better than restricted trade for a small country.” We will provide another demonstration of this result in the next chapter.

# Regional Trade Agreements

We now extend our results to the case where a group of countries decides to pursue free trade internally, while maintaining tariffs against the rest of the world. Under a customs union, the countries involved choose a common external tariff with the rest of the world, whereas under a free trade area the countries maintain different tariffs on imports from the rest of the world. Let us consider the customs union case first, since it is easier.

The analysis of customs unions dates back to Viner (1950), who introduced the terms "trade creation" versus "trade diversion." Trade creation refers to a situation where two countries within the customs union begin to trade with each other, whereas formerly they produced the good in question for themselves. In terms of Corollary (a) above, the countries go from autarky (in this good) to trading with zero tariffs, and they both gain. Trade diversion, on the other hand, occurs when two countries begin to trade within the union, but one of these countries had formerly imported the good from outside the union. We may presume that the importing country formerly had the same tariffs on all countries, but purchased from outside the

union because that price was lowest. After the union, the country switches its purchases from the lowest-price to a higher-price country, so in terms of Corollary (b) there is a negative efficiency effect, and the country could lose from joining the union.

To verify these results more formally, we need to expand our notation to incorporate the customs union. In our analysis above we had implicitly assumed that each country  $i$  had a single tariff vector  $t^i$  applied against all other countries. This is no longer the case: countries in the union will face zero tariffs among themselves, and still maintain the same external tariff with respect to outside countries. An easy way to capture this is to index goods by their region of origin and their region of destination. That is, let the first N goods denote those produced in the union and sent to the union; the next N goods are produced outside the union and sent outside the union; the next N are produced in the union and sent outside the union; and the last N are produced outside the union and sent into the union. In total we therefore have 4N goods, but only the last 2N of these involve trade between the union and outside countries. This treatment of goods still is consistent with the Arrow-Debreu model, where goods can be indexed by location.

With this notation, the above Theorem and Corollary continue to hold. For a union country i, the first N tariffs are zero, the second N tariffs are irrelevant (since these goods are traded between nonunion countries), and the last 2N tariffs are equalized for all countries of the union. We will denote this post-union tariff vector by  $t^1$ . Notice that with zero tariffs on countries within the union, the term  $t^{1'}(m^{il} - m^{i0})$  measures the change in tariff revenue for country i's imports from outside the union. Trade diversion means that country i switches from the lowest-price supplier from outside the union (where tariff revenue is collected) to another

supplier within the union (with no tariff revenue), so that  $t^{1'}(m^{i1} - m^{i0}) < 0$  and tariff revenue has fallen. Therefore, country  $i$  can be worse off. This result illustrates what is called a "second best" problem: by eliminating its tariffs with all other countries, a small country would necessary be better off, but by only going partway towards this goal (eliminating tariffs with the union countries only), there is no guarantee of gains.

This outcome made it seem like no general result on the desirability of customs unions was possible. Remarkably, Kemp and Wan (1976) were still able to obtain such a result. Their goal was to ensure that the customs union benefits its members, and also does not harm the rest of the world. To achieve this, Kemp and Wan used the following rule: the customs union should keep the world price  $p^*$  fixed, or equivalently, keep the purchases from the rest of the world  $x^*$  fixed. This rule can be contrasted with the criterion used in the WTO on customs unions. From Article XXIV in Table 6.1, we see that customs unions are "not prevented" provided that "the duties [with outside parties] shall not on the whole be higher or more restrictive than the general incidence of the duties. . .prior to the formation." Thus, the criterion used in WTO is that the tariffs with respect to countries outside the union should not be higher than before, whereas the rule used by Kemp and Wan is that the trade with respect to outside countries is not affected by the formation of the customs union. The Kemp-Wan rule is the correct one to avoid losses, not the existing WTO criterion.

To develop the result of Kemp and Wan, let us denote the countries in the customs union by  $i = 1,\dots,C$ . Prior to the union they have tariffs  $t^{i0}$ . We let  $p^*^0$  denote the world prices in this equilibrium, and  $m^{i0}$  denote the import vector of country  $i$ . Let the net export vector of the rest of the world be denoted by  $x^*(p^{*0})$ . Notice that this vector is zero for the first 2N goods (which

refer to trade strictly inside or outside the union), and potentially non-zero otherwise. Summing imports over all countries in the union, the equilibrium condition is:

$$
\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \mathrm {m} ^ {\mathrm {i} 0} = \mathrm {x} * (\mathrm {p} ^ {* 0}). \tag {6.11}
$$

After the customs union the countries involved have a unified tariff  $t^1$ , the elements of which are zero for purchases from within-union countries. Let  $m^{i1}$  denote the vector of imports of country  $i$  in this situation. Kemp and Wan (1976) prove that there exists a unified tariff  $t^1$  which ensures that,

$$
\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \mathrm {m} ^ {\mathrm {i} 1} = \mathrm {x} * (\mathrm {p} ^ {* 0}). \tag {6.12}
$$

The fact that the prices  $\mathfrak{p}^{*^0}$  and exports from the rest of the world  $\mathrm{x}^{*}(\mathrm{p}^{*^{0}})$  are unchanged due to the customs union guarantees that the rest of the world is not affected by it. The question now is whether the members of the customs union also gain, and whether this requires some transfers between the countries or not. This is answered by:

# Theorem (Kemp and Wan, 1976; Grinols, 1981)

Let the countries  $i = 1, \ldots, C$  form a customs union, with the common external tariff such that prices and purchases from the rest of the world are unchanged. Suppose that each country within the customs union receives the transfers  $-t^{1'}(m^{i1} - m^{i0})$  from the rest of the union. Then there is a pattern of lump-sum transfers within each country such that no individual is worse off, and the government budget in each country is non-negative.

# Proof:

Consider the transfers described in (6.8), but applied within each country. It follows that each consumer in every country of the union can still afford their previous consumption bundles. Furthermore, noting that prices  $p^*$  from the rest of the world are fixed, then from (6.10) the government budget in each country is no less than  $t^{1'}(m^{il} - m^{i0})$ . Therefore, each country can afford to give up this amount (or receive it if negative), and have a non-negative budget. It remains to be shown that these transfers within the union are self-financing, that is,  $\sum_{i=1}^{C} t^{1'}(m^{il} - m^{i0}) = 0$ . But this follows immediately from the fact that total union imports are equal in (6.11) and (6.12),  $\sum_{i=1}^{C} m^{il} = \sum_{i=1}^{C} m^{i0}$ . QED

It is apparent that the way losses are avoided for the union is by keeping total imports fixed: in that way, the total tariff revenue (evaluated at post-union external tariffs) is also fixed. But keeping total imports fixed also means that world prices are fixed, which eliminates any terms of trade impacts for the union and the rest of the world. Thus, keeping total union imports fixed immediately satisfies the criterion identified in the earlier theorem: when summed over the countries of the union, the term  $(\mathfrak{p}^{*0} - \mathfrak{p}^{*1})'\mathfrak{m}^{\mathrm{i0}} + \mathfrak{t}^{1'}(\mathfrak{m}^{\mathrm{i1}} - \mathfrak{m}^{\mathrm{i0}})$  is zero, so the union as a whole is no worse off. An individual country may experience a loss in their own tariff revenue of  $\mathfrak{t}^{1'}(\mathfrak{m}^{\mathrm{i1}} - \mathfrak{m}^{\mathrm{i0}})$ , but this could be compensated by transfers from other countries within the union.

It has been more than 25 years since Kemp and Wan demonstrated this result, and in the meantime, there has been a proliferation of regional agreements under GATT Article XXIV. Many of these have not been customs unions, but instead, are free trade areas (FTA's). Is it possible to extend the Kemp-Wan theorem to cover these? As explained above, FTA's differ

from customs unions in that the countries involved have their own tariff vector with respect to the rest of the world. At the same time, tariffs are zero within the union, so goods can be sent between these countries freely. This means that producer prices must be equalized within the union, but by virtue of their differing tariffs on outside countries, consumer prices can differ within the union. It follows that the method of proof used by Kemp and Wan (1976) cannot be used for free trade areas. Recently, however, Krishna and Panagariya (2002) have developed a new proof, which shows that Kemp-Wan theorem can indeed be extended to cover FTA's. Their approach can be described quite easily using our notation above.

Let  $\mathrm{x}^{*}(\mathrm{p}^{0})$  denote the initial net exports from the rest of the world to the countries planning to form a FTA. Recall that this vector is zero for the first 2N goods (which refer to trade strictly inside or outside the union), and potentially non-zero otherwise. The approach of Krishna and Panagariya is to ensure that every country in the FTA has exactly the same trade with the rest of the world as they did initially. Letting  $\mathrm{m}^{\mathrm{i0}}$  and  $\mathrm{m}^{\mathrm{i1}}$  denote the imports of country  $\mathrm{i} = 1, \ldots, \mathrm{C}$ , which is a member of the FTA, we require that:

$$
m _ {j} ^ {i 0} = m _ {j} ^ {i 1}, \quad \text {f o r g o o d s j = 2 N + 1 , . . . , 4 N}. \tag {6.13}
$$

Thus, we require every FTA member import and export the same quantity with the rest of world as they did before the free trade area. While Krishna and Panagariya do not provide a general existence result, we can certainly construct examples where there are country-specific tariffs ensuring that (6.13) holds, and denote these by  $t^{i1}$ ,  $i = 1,\dots,C$ . Notice that (6.13) implies that (6.12) still holds, i.e. total net exports from the FTA to the rest of the world equals  $x^* (p^{*0})$ , its value initially. So we conclude that the equilibrium world prices are still given by  $p^{*0}$ .

Since trade with the outside world is not affected by the FTA, and neither are prices, we have obtained the result:

# Theorem (Krishna and Panagariya, 2002)

Let the countries  $i = 1, \dots, C$  form a free trade area, with external tariffs  $t^{i1}$  for each country such that prices and purchases from the rest of the world are unchanged. Then there is a pattern of lump-sum transfers within each country such that no individual is worse off, and the government budget in each country is non-negative.

# Proof:

Again we use the transfers described in (6.8) applied within each country. It follows that each consumer in every country of the FTA can still afford their previous consumption bundle, and from (6.11), the government budget in each country is no less than  $t^{i1'}(m^{i1} - m^{i0})$ . The first N elements of  $t^{i1}$  are zero due to free trade within the FTA, and the next N elements of  $m^{i0}$  and  $m^{i1}$  are zero because those goods are produced and delivered outside the FTA. Then (6.13) ensures that  $t^{i1'}(m^{i1} - m^{i0}) = 0$ , so the budget is non-negative in every country  $i = 1,\dots,C$ . QED

One feature of FTA's and the above theorem should be emphasized. Because tariffs with respect to the rest of world differ between the member countries, outside countries would have an incentive to export their goods into the lowest-tariff country of the FTA, and then transship it to other member countries. This type of activity needs to be ruled out to obtain the above theorem. That is, transshipment through the lowest-tariff country would violate condition (6.13), which specifies that each country must import the same quantity from outside countries as before the FTA. More generally, transshipment through the lowest-tariff country would lead to a drop

in tariff revenue for other countries of the FTA, violating the condition to obtain Pareto gains. To ensure welfare gains, therefore, we need to rule out transshipment of goods not produced in the FTA.

In practice, restrictions on such transshipment within FTA's are known as "rules of origin" (ROO). Within NAFTA, for example, each and every good must be certified as "North American made" before it can be shipped freely between Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. This certification is typically made based on the percentage of value added coming from North American production, or the use of some key input produced in North America. This prevents a foreign country from exporting into Canada, for example, and then sending the good to the U.S. or Mexico, unless it had enough further processing to certify it as "North American made." Such rules are enormously complex, since they require a specification of the production process for each and every good. Because the ROO are an artificial restriction on the movement of goods they are often criticized (see for example, Krishna and Krueger, 1995). But the theorem of Krishna and Panagariya sheds new light on these practices, since the welfare-improving FTA depends on their use.

# Evidence on Regional Agreements

The above theorems allow us to conclude that welfare-improving customs unions and FTA's exist, but from this we should not infer that regional trade agreements in practice are necessarily a good thing. The possibility of trade diversion identified by Viner (1950), and any

changes in the terms of trade, need to be evaluated empirically before judging actual agreements. More generally, we should be concerned with whether regional trade agreements help or hinder the movement towards global free trade through multilateral negotiations under the WTO. This political economy issue will be discussed in chapter 9.

Grinols (1984) was among the first to measure the gains or losses from membership in a customs union. He examined Britain joining the European Economic Community in 1973. This meant that Britain had to adopt the common external tariff of the EEC. Not only would this affect domestic price  $p^i$  in Britain, it could also be expected to have an impact on the foreign prices  $p^{*i}$  facing Britain, i.e. on its terms of trade. We are recognizing here that the prices charged by foreign exporting firms are often responsive to a change in tariffs by just one importing country. This occurs when foreign firms segment their export markets, charging different prices in each. This behavior is related to imperfect competition, as will be discussed in the next chapter.

Grinols measured the prices for British exports and imports during the years after its membership in the EEC. Multiplying these prices by initial quantities gives  $(\mathrm{p}^{*^{\mathrm{i0}}} - \mathrm{p}^{*^{\mathrm{i1}}})' \mathrm{m}^{\mathrm{i0}}$ , or the value of changes in the terms of trade. In every year from 1973-1980, it turned out that the British terms of trade had fallen from 1972, and the amount of this decline averaged about  $2.3\%$  of British GDP. (This amount includes the lost tariff revenue on imports, which automatically become property of the customs union, and the average drop in the terms of trade without including tariff revenue was still  $1.7\%$  of GDP.)

In order to compensate for this loss, Britain would have needed to obtain some transfer from the EEC, i.e. the amount  $t^{1'}(m^{i1} - m^{i0})$  in our discussion above. There was a wide range

of transfers between countries as part of EEC membership, including the Regional Development Funds (allocated to projects in lower-income regions), special funds in agriculture, coal and steel, value-added taxes, etc. The net transfers were slightly in Britain's favor, but not enough to offset the terms of trade loss, so that summing  $(\mathfrak{p}^{*\mathrm{i0}} - \mathfrak{p}^{*\mathrm{i1}})'\mathfrak{m}^{\mathrm{i0}} + \mathfrak{t}^{1'}(\mathfrak{m}^{\mathrm{i1}} - \mathfrak{m}^{\mathrm{i0}})$  still gives an average loss for Britain of  $2.26\%$  of GDP annually.

We conclude that the sufficient condition to ensure Britain's gain from joining the EEC, i.e.  $(\mathrm{p}^{*^{\mathrm{i0}}} - \mathrm{p}^{*^{\mathrm{i1}}})' \mathrm{m}^{\mathrm{i0}} + \mathrm{t}^{1'}(\mathrm{m}^{\mathrm{i1}} - \mathrm{m}^{\mathrm{i0}}) > 0$ , did not hold. This does not necessarily imply that Britain was worse off, however, since it still enjoys free trade within the EEC, and so had efficiency gains on both the consumption and production side for that reason. In Figure 6.1, for example, these gains are illustrated by the movement from point A to point B. Grinols attempts to evaluate these gains for Britain and finds that they are quite small. The conclusion is that its membership in the EEC in 1973 led to a welfare loss that averaged about  $2\%$  of GDP annually through 1980.

One criticism that can be made of Grinols' methodology is that he simply accepts the trade prices as data, and presumes that any change from 1972 represents the effect of Britain's membership in the EEC. Thus, the terms of trade decline is attributed to Britain's changing its external tariff to the common EEC level. This does not allow for any exogenous changes in the terms of trade due to factors affecting supply and demand on world markets. To control for such factors, we need to specify prices as functions of the tariffs, as well as other relevant factors. Using a log-linear regression to estimate prices as a function of tariffs and other factors allows us to infer the specific impact of the tariff change. This is the approach taken by Chang and Winters (2002) for MERCOSUR.

Specifically, Chang and Winters (2002) consider prices from various countries (U.S., Japan, German, etc.) to Brazil, which is the largest market in MERCOSUR. This customs union had the effect of eliminating tariffs between Brazil and Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, as well as equalizing their external tariffs. Of interest, then, is the direct effect of the change in the external tariff of Brazil on the prices charged by foreign firms; as well as the indirect effect of the elimination of the tariffs between Brazil and Argentina on the prices charged by foreign firms to Brazil. Both this direct and indirect effect will lead to a terms of trade change for Brazil, as well as to the countries selling in that market. The regression framework used to measure these effects draws on Feenstra (1989), as discussed in detail in the next chapter, and specifies prices as a log-linear function of tariffs and other factors. By pooling data across disaggregate products and years, Chang and Winters can use annual fixed effects to control for any changes in prices that are common across commodities.

For the case of MERCOSUR, Chang and Winters find that many of the prices charged by external countries, including the U.S., Japan, Germany, Korea and Chile indeed fell as a result of the change in Brazilian tariffs. The direct impact of the change in the Brazilian external tariff is smaller than the indirect effect of the elimination of its tariff with Argentina. On average, foreign prices charged to Brazil fall by one-third as much as the drop in the tariff with Argentina (and by even more if yearly fixed effects are used). This implies a significant terms of trade gain for Brazil and loss for the exporting countries. For example, Chang and Winters evaluate this loss in 1996 as \$624 million for the United States (which exceeds 10% of its export sales to Brazil of \$5.4 billion in 1991), \$59 million for Japan, \$236 million for Germany, \$14 million for Korea, and \$17 million for Chile. These figures serve to illustrate the potential losses that a

customs union can impose on the countries left out.

For the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of 1994 and the earlier Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) of 1989, Clausing (2001) and Romalis (2002) estimate the impact on trade quantities rather than prices, using highly disaggregate data for the United States. Clausing estimates the impact of CUSFTA on U.S. imports from Canada over 1989-1994, and on U.S. imports from the rest of the world. These trade quantities are modeled as log-linear function of tariffs and other factors, and pooling across commodities and years allows annual fixed effects to be used. Romalis examines where the U.S. sources its imports of some 5,000 commodities, and compares this where the European Union sources the same commodities, using a "differences in differences" technique to identify the impact of both CUSFTA and NAFTA.

Clausing finds that U.S. imports from Canada responded predictably to CUSFTA, with a  $10\%$  drop in the U.S. tariff leading to a  $1\%$  expansion of its imports from Canada. This is an example of trade creation between the countries. At the same time, the drop in U.S. tariffs had a negative but statistically insignificant impact on its imports from the rest of the world, so there is little evidence to support trade diversion. This conclusion suggests that the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was relatively benign for other countries, but should be interpreted with caution: to make welfare conclusions, it is better to estimate the effect of tariff changes on prices, as done by Chang and Winters (2002), rather than quantities. Romalis also finds a significant impact of CUSFTA on U.S. imports from Canada, along with a large impact of NAFTA on U.S. imports from Mexico. However, he suggests that NAFTA may have led to

substantial trade diversion, because the largest tariff reductions were often in commodities where the U.S. relied on imports from outside of North America.

# Imperfect Competition

An omitted topic in the chapter thus far is the role of imperfect competition. This raises two distinct issues. First, in industries with monopolistic pricing there is a gap between price and marginal costs. Because prices reflect consumer valuations of a product, this gap indicates that consumers would be better off by increasing the output of that industry. If this occurs due to the opening of trade, we might expect that the economy is better off; but if trade reduces the outputs of industries with imperfect competition, this seems to indicate potential losses. This intuition has been confirmed by Markusen (1981) in a model with one competitive industry and one monopolistic industry. Helpman (1984b) has generalized this to many industries, and we will present their results using the same notation as earlier in the chapter.

Second, models of imperfect competition often have increasing returns to scale, such as in the monopolistic competition model we studied in chapter 5. The presence of increasing returns creates a reason to be concerned about losses from trade. Many years ago, Graham (1923) argued that with increasing returns an industry facing strong import competition might be forced to contract, leading to higher average costs, and that this would be a reason for protection. Ethier (1982) has confirmed this results in a model relying on increasing returns that are external to the firm, and found that the small country may experience losses from trade due to the contraction of its increasing-returns industry. Interestingly, Markusen (1981) found that the monopolistic firm in the large country might be forced to contact due to trade, so the large country potentially faced losses. As suggested by these results, a general statement on the gains from trade under increasing returns is difficult to obtain. We will summarize some results that

apply under monopolistic competition, due to Helpman and Krugman (1985, chap. 9).

We begin with the case of imperfect competition under constant returns to scale. There are a fixed number of firms in each imperfectly competitive industry, and they set marginal revenue equal to marginal costs, which we assume is the same for all firms in the industry. The precise way that marginal revenue is computed will depend on the market structure, such as Cournot competition in quantities or Bertrand competition in prices. We do not want to get into these details here, but simply denote the marginal revenue for each firm selling good  $i$  under imperfect competition by  $\widetilde{p}_i \equiv m_r_i < p_i$ . For goods sold competitively we let  $\widetilde{p}_i \equiv p_i$  denote the product price. In equilibrium,  $\widetilde{p}_i$  also equals the marginal cost of production.

For simplicity we suppose that the factor supply choices from consumer are fixed, so total endowments are  $\overline{\mathbf{v}}$ . Let the feasible outputs  $y$  be denoted by the convex set  $S$ . Because  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}$  equals marginal costs, the equilibrium outputs under imperfect competition will solve the problem:

$$
\mathrm {G} (\widetilde {\mathrm {p}}, \bar {\mathrm {v}}) \equiv \max  _ {\mathrm {y} \geq 0} \left\{\widetilde {\mathrm {p}} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} \mid \mathrm {y} \in \mathrm {S} \right\}. \tag {6.14}
$$

That is, the marginal costs  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}$  act like a set of shadow prices, and the equilibrium outputs maximize the value of  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}'\mathfrak{y}$ . This problem is illustrated in Figure 6.3, for an equilibrium at point B. With perfect competition in the factor markets but imperfect competition in the goods market, point B is on (not inside) the production possibilities frontier, so that  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}$  is the gradient of a supporting hyperplane at point B. It follows that if  $\mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{a}}$  is any other feasible output vector, then  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}'\mathbf{y} \geq \widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}'\mathbf{y}^{\mathrm{a}}$ . In the case we have illustrated, the actual prices are shown by  $\mathfrak{p}$ , and since this line is steeper than  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}$ , it follows that the relative price of good 1 exceeds its marginal cost; i.e. good 1 is produced with imperfect competition and good 2 under perfect competition.

Figure 6.3

Total profits earned by firms in the autarky equilibrium are  $p^{a'} y^{a} - w^{a'} \overline{v}$ , and each consumer is entitled to some fixed fraction  $\lambda^h$  of these. Then the autarky budget constraint of consumer  $h$  is re-written from (6.1) as:

$$
p ^ {a ^ {\prime}} c ^ {h a} \leq w ^ {a ^ {\prime}} \bar {v} ^ {h} + \lambda^ {h} \left(p ^ {a ^ {\prime}} y ^ {a} - w ^ {a ^ {\prime}} \bar {v}\right), \tag {6.15}
$$

where  $\overline{\mathbf{v}}^{\mathrm{h}}$  is the vector of fixed factor supplies from individual h. Let us now open the

economy to trade at the prices p, and introduce a system of lump-sum transfers, so the post-trade budget constraint of each consumer is:

$$
p ^ {\prime} c ^ {h} \leq w ^ {\prime} \bar {v} ^ {h} + R ^ {h} + \lambda^ {h} \left(p ^ {\prime} y - w ^ {\prime} \bar {v}\right), \tag {6.16}
$$

and the lump-sum transfers to each individual are:

$$
R ^ {h} = \left(p - p ^ {a}\right) ^ {\prime} c ^ {h a} - \left(w - w ^ {a}\right) ^ {\prime} \bar {v} ^ {h} + \lambda^ {h} \left(p ^ {a} ^ {\prime} y ^ {a} - w ^ {a} ^ {\prime} \bar {v}\right) - \lambda^ {h} \left(p ^ {\prime} y - w ^ {\prime} \bar {v}\right). \tag {6.17}
$$

It is straightforward to show that these transfers will allow each individual to obtain at least their autarky consumption bundle, so that they are no worse off. The question, then, is whether the government can afford this policy.

Summing the transfers in (6.17), and reversing the sign, we obtain:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} R ^ {h} = (p ^ {a} - p) ^ {\prime} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} c ^ {h a} - (w ^ {a} - w) ^ {\prime} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} \bar {v} ^ {h} - \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} \lambda^ {h} [ (p ^ {a} ^ {\prime} y ^ {a} - w ^ {a} ^ {\prime} \bar {v}) - (p ^ {\prime} y - w ^ {\prime} \bar {v}) ] \\ = \left(p ^ {a} - p\right) ^ {\prime} y ^ {a} - \left(w ^ {a} - w\right) ^ {\prime} \bar {v} - \left(p ^ {a} ^ {\prime} y ^ {a} - w ^ {a ^ {\prime}} \bar {v}\right) + \left(p ^ {\prime} y - w ^ {\prime} \bar {v}\right) \\ \geq \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} - \mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {a}}\right), \tag {6.18} \\ \end{array}
$$

where the second line follows by using  $\sum_{h=1}^{H} c^{ha} = y^a$ ,  $\sum_{h=1}^{H} \overline{v}^h = \overline{v}$  and  $\sum_{h=1}^{H} \lambda^h = 1$ , and the third line follows by canceling terms.

If condition (6.18) is non-negative, this sufficient to ensure Pareto gains can be achieved. That condition is readily interpreted as saying that the value of GDP evaluated at free trade prices should not fall. In Figure 6.3, this means that the autarky equilibrium needs to lie to the left of point B, such as at point A. Recalling the industry 1 is imperfectly competitive, this condition ensures the Pareto gains that the output of the imperfectly competitive industry increases. While this condition ensures that the value of GDP increases in Figure 6.3, let us see whether this it ensures Pareto gains more generally.

Consider the following condition to guarantee Pareto gains, as proposed by Helpman (1984, p. 353):

$$
(p - \widetilde {p}) ^ {\prime} \left(y - y ^ {a}\right) \geq 0, \tag {6.19}
$$

where  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}$  are the marginal revenue/prices under free trade. For competitive industries with  $\mathrm{p_i} = \widetilde{\mathrm{p_i}}$ , condition (6.19) is automatically satisfied, while for imperfectly competitive industries with  $\mathrm{p_i} > \widetilde{\mathrm{p_i}}$ , (6.19) will be satisfied if  $\mathrm{y_i} \geq \mathrm{y_i^a}$  so their outputs do not fall going from autarky to free trade. When (6.19) holds, then we have:

$$
p ^ {\prime} \left(y - y ^ {a}\right) \geq \widetilde {p} ^ {\prime} \left(y - y ^ {a}\right) \geq 0, \tag {6.20}
$$

where the last inequality holds because the value of “shadow GDP”  $\mathrm{G}(\widetilde{\mathrm{p}},\mathrm{y}) = \widetilde{\mathrm{p}}^{\prime}\mathrm{y}$  is maximized at the equilibrium outputs  $\mathbf{y}$ . Thus, (6.19) implies that (6.20) holds, which ensures that (6.18) is also non-negative. We have therefore proved:

# Theorem (Markusen, 1981; Helpman, 1984)

With constant returns to scale, if the output of every good produced under imperfect competition does not fall going from autarky to free trade, then Pareto gains from trade can be achieved using the lump-sum transfers in (6.17).

Thus, the key condition to achieve Pareto gains is that industry output does not fall in the imperfectly competitive industries of the country in question. Admittedly, it may be hard to achieve this condition across several countries: if industry output increases in one country, is it not more likely to fall in another? This was the case analyzed by Markusen (1981). For two countries that are identical except for size, he found that the smaller country would experience an increase in the good sold under imperfect competition, but not the larger country. This means that gains from trade are assured only for the smaller country.

One way to deal with this problem of "unequal" gains across country is to derive a condition for Pareto gains due to free trade among a group of countries  $i = 1, \dots, C$  (which can be the entire world). As we found for the analysis of customs unions in the previous section, we will end up summing the criterion in (6.18) across the group of countries. That is, the combined government budget for the group is non-negative provided that the terms of trade with respect to outside countries do not change, and:

$$
\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \left(\mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i a}}\right) \geq 0. \tag {6.18'}
$$

How can we ensure that (6.18') holds? Consider the generalization of the Helpman (1984b) condition in (6.19):

$$
\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \left(\mathrm {p} - \widetilde {\mathrm {p}} ^ {\mathrm {i}}\right) ^ {\prime} \left(\mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i a}}\right) \geq 0, \tag {6.19'}
$$

where  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  are the marginal revenue/prices under free trade. These will be identical across countries in the competitive industries, but in general can differ across countries in the non-competitive industries. A sufficient condition to rule this out, however, is to have marginal costs equal across countries, due to identical technologies and factor price equalization. In that case, we can write  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}^{\mathrm{i}} = \widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}$  in (6.19').

When condition (6.19') holds, we readily obtain,

$$
\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \mathrm {p} ^ {\prime} \left(\mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i a}}\right) \geq \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \tilde {\mathrm {p}} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i a}}\right) \geq 0, \tag {6.20'}
$$

where the last inequality holds because  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathfrak{y}^{\mathrm{i}}\geq \widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}^{\mathrm{i}}\mathfrak{y}^{\mathrm{ia}}$  for every country of the union. We therefore see that (6.19') implies (6.18'), which guarantee Pareto gains for the group of countries. If marginal costs are identical across countries in the free trade equilibrium, so  $\widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}^{\mathrm{i}} = \widetilde{\mathfrak{p}}$ , then condition (6.19') will be satisfied whenever the total group output of each imperfectly competitive good does not fall. This condition generalizes the above theorem, and ensures Pareto gains for the group of countries, though there will still be a need to transfer income between them as we have discussed in the previous section for customs unions.

Let us now consider the case of monopolistic competition and increasing returns to scale. In that case, each firm is producing a differentiated product. As discussed by Helpman and Krugman (1985, chap. 9), Pareto gains from trade are ensured if: (i) the output of each firm still producing does not fall going from autarky to free trade; (ii) total industry output (equal to the number of firms times the output of each) does not fall going from autarky to free trade; (iii) the set of goods available to consumers is not reduced due to the opening of trade. Notice that

condition (i) allows some firms to exit due to the opening of trade, as discussed in chapter 5. Indeed, their departure gives room for other firms to increase their outputs and take advantage of economies of scale. Examples can be constructed, however, where one or more of these conditions are violated so that losses from trade are possible. $^{8}$  The question is whether there are some "reasonable" assumptions that rule this out.

Helpman and Krugman (1985, pp. 187-190) have identified quite weak assumptions to ensure that conditions (i)-(iii) hold. Specifically, they assume that each industry in the economy is organized like the Krugman model considered at the beginning of chapter 5, with consumption in each industry coming from an additively separable sub-utility function. Assume that: (a) the elasticity of demand in non-decreasing in output; (b) there is a constant share of expenditure spent on each differentiated goods industry; (c) the production function for each differentiated good is homothetic; (d) equilibria in each differentiated goods industry is symmetric, with identical costs, prices and output. Then they demonstrate that the opening of trade will lead to at least as many goods, and at least as much output of each provided only that the world output of each differentiated goods industry does not contract. In that case, there is not even any need for transfers between countries to ensure Pareto gains from trade.

# Conclusions

The idea that countries gain from trade is as old as the idea of comparative advantage itself – Ricardo wrote his model of trade between England and Portugal to demonstrate both claims. But gains “for a country” does not have a well-defined meaning unless we specify what this implies for the many different individuals located there. In this chapter we have taken the heterogeneity of individuals seriously, and identified conditions under which all agents can gain

from trade, i.e. Pareto gains are achieved. The lump sum transfers that we have discussed require too much information to be implemented in practice, but are still valuable because they allow us to show that Pareto gains are in principle possible. The commodity tax/subsidies introduced by Dixit and Norman (1980) are an alternative means of achieving Pareto gains. In the presence of mobility costs, however, these may need to be supplemented with some form of trade adjustment assistance.

Our results for Pareto gains within a country can be extended to cover the comparison of any two trading situations, and also to cover multiple countries, as with customs unions and free trade areas. In addition, we showed how imperfect competition could be incorporated. Missing from our analysis, however, is an important topic related to imperfect competition and the gains from regional trade agreements. Suppose that trade in differentiated products occurs under monopolistic competition, subject to "iceberg" transportation costs as discussed in chapter 5. Furthermore, suppose that the countries forming a regional agreement do not aim to keep welfare in the rest of world unchanged; on the contrary, these countries adjust the tariffs applied to the rest of the world to their own optimal advantage. In the next chapter, we will call this the "optimal" tariff, and it is applied to shift a country's terms of trade in its favor. Finally, suppose that the world splits up into a number of such regional areas, each of them equally sized. Then how does the formation of these areas impact world welfare?

This question has been addressed by Krugman (1991a, 1991b), with two quite distinct answers. First, ignoring transportation costs, Krugman (1991a) argues that with the world divided into a number of equally-sized regional trading areas, the worst number of such areas is three. The logic of this proposition is that with just one area, encompassing all countries, we have the highest level of world welfare (i.e. global free trade). Conversely, with many equal-

sized areas, each group of countries will have little influence in changing their terms of trade, so tariffs are low and we are again close to free trade. But at some intermediate number of areas, tariffs will be higher and world welfare lower. Stylized calculations suggest that world welfare is minimized with three areas, which is a depressing result in view of the possible formation of three trading regions in reality: the Americas, Europe and Asia.

But this view of the world ignores the fact that actual trading regions are often between geographically close countries (e.g. the EEC and NAFTA), so the "natural" trading advantages of these countries are just enhanced by the regional agreement. To see how this affects the argument, suppose now that there are three continents (America, Europe and Asia) with multiple countries in each. As in Krugman (1991b), take an extreme case where transportation costs are infinite for trade between the continents, but zero within each continent. In the absence of any regional agreements, the countries in each continent will be applying optimal tariffs against each other. But with a regional free trade agreement on each continent, then tariffs are eliminated, and world welfare would be maximized: the fact that outside countries are excluded from each regional agreement is irrelevant, since transportation costs between the continents are so high. So in this case, three regional trading areas maximize world welfare!

These two starkly different results suggest that the pattern and level of transportation costs between countries is crucial to determining the welfare effects of regional agreements. Obviously, we need to go beyond the two extreme cases of Krugman (1991a,b), and this is done by Frankel (1997). Continuing with Krugman's example of a world divided into continents, each of which is divided into multiple countries, Frankel explores the welfare impact of regional agreements within or across continents. An agreement within a continent (where transportation costs are low) is called "natural," while an agreement across continents (where transportation

costs are high) is called “unnatural.” Frankel confirms that “natural” trading areas are more likely to lead to world welfare gains than “unnatural” areas. However, it turns out that having regional agreements within continents is not always welfare improving, and the case where these “natural” areas fail to lead to world gains is called “supernatural.” This brief summary is meant to suggest that the impact of regional trade agreements – in theory or in practice – is still a wide open area for research, and we shall return to this topic in chapter 9.

Figure 6.4

In earlier chapters, our only demonstration of the gains from trade has been a diagram like Figure 6.4, where we show the indifference curves  $\phi$  being lifted off the PPF due to free trade. The question is: should we think of these indifference curves as applying to single "representative" consumer, or is there some other interpretation that allows for consumers who differ in their utility functions? The following results are due to Samuelson (1956), and give a precise interpretation to the indifference curves shown.

Suppose that we have H consumers with utility functions  $\mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{h}}(\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{h}})$ ,  $\mathrm{h = 1,\dots,H}$ , where we ignore individual supplies of factors for simplicity. We assume that these are increasing and quasi-concave. Further, suppose that we have a social welfare function  $\mathrm{W(u^{1},\ldots,u^{H})}$ , which is non-decreasing and quasi-concave. Then Samuelson defined the social utility function as:

$$
\phi (c) = \max  _ {c ^ {h} \geq 0} W [ u ^ {1} \left(c ^ {1}\right), \dots , u ^ {H} \left(c ^ {H}\right) ] \quad \text {s t .} \quad \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} c ^ {h} \leq c. \tag {6.21}
$$

Thus, this social utility function takes the total amount of consumption goods available, c, and allocates it across individuals so as to maximize social welfare. This allocation is a form of "lump sum" transfers, where we are physically allocating the goods (though the outcome would be similar if we used lump sum transfers of income instead).

Samuelson argued that we could think of the indifference curves in Figure 6.4 as being iso-curves of the function  $\phi$ , so moving to a higher indifference curve due to trade (as illustrated) means that social welfare has indeed increased.

To further understand Samuelson's approach, answer the following:

6.1 The fact that we are moving from a welfare level of  $\phi_1$  in Figure 6.4 to  $\phi_2$  due to the opening of trade proves that some person(s) utility must have increased, but it does not prove that everyone's utility has increased. Can you think of a special form for the welfare function W that will ensure that when  $\phi$  goes up, then everyone's utility must go up as well? [This social welfare function is used by Chipman (1987, p. 528), for example.]
