# Chapter 8: Import Quotas and Export Subsidies

In addition to import tariffs, quotas and subsidies are widely used forms of trade policy. Quotas and subsidies can in principle be applied to either imports or exports, but we will focus here on import quotas and export subsidies. How do these policy instruments differ from tariffs, and does this depend on the type of competition in the market? These are the questions we shall investigate in this chapter.

We begin with the result of Bhagwati (1965) on the "equivalence" of tariffs and quotas. This means that under perfect competition, applying a quota that limits the number of units imported will have essentially the same effects as applying a certain level of tariff: for each quota, there is an "equivalent" tariff. This equivalence result no longer holds under imperfect competition, however. Bhagwati (1965) considered a monopolistic home importer subject to a quota, and that analysis was later extended to duopoly with a home firm and foreign firm subject to an import quota (Harris, 1985, Krishna, 1989). As we shall see, a quota and tariff that have comparable effects on the level of imports can then have quite different effects on the import price, and therefore on welfare in the importing country.

Another reason for tariffs and quotas to differ occurs when foreign firms can choose the quality of the good that they export. In that case, a limitation on the number of units exported (as under a quota) will have quite a different impact from a tariff on the value of exports (as with an ad valorem tariff). The importance of this case became apparent with the quota applied to Japanese auto exports to the United States during the 1980s. The evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that Japanese firms changed the characteristics of the cars they sold, shifting towards higher quality and higher-priced models. We shall describe a theoretical model of quality choice and the empirical evidence for autos (Feenstra, 1988a).

The finding that trade policies have differing effects depending on the market structure carries over to the case of export subsidies. In the conventional two-sector model, there is no reason to use export subsidies: they will lead to a deadweight loss (analogous to a tariff) for a small country, and have an additional terms of trade loss (the opposite of a tariff) for a large country. This seems to contradict the fact that many countries have used export subsidies to support their industries at some time. To explain this, we need to go beyond the two-sector model with perfect competition. Adding more goods turns out to make a difference, and there is a potential role for targeted export subsidies in models with many goods (Feenstra, 1986, Itoh and Kiyono, 1987).

Dropping perfect competition, and instead allowing for duopoly between a home and foreign firm exporting to a third market, also makes a difference. The question then is whether the home government can give its own firm a "strategic" advantage by subsidizing it. We shall require that the subsidy also be in the national interest, which means that profits for the exporter need to rise by more than the amount of the subsidy itself. Initial analysis of this problem (Brander and Spencer, 1985) suggested that such an advantage would indeed occur, at least under Cournot-Nash competition. Later work, however (Eaton and Grossman, 1986), showed that this advantage would be reversed under Bertrand competition. The conclusion is that export subsidies are in the national interest only under some forms of market competition, but not generally. We conclude the chapter by investigating the effects of subsidies to the production of commercial aircraft, produced by Boeing in America and Airbus in Europe. Irwin and Pavcnik (2001) have recently investigated the effects of subsidies on prices and profits in this industry, as we shall discuss.

# Equivalence of Tariffs and Quotas

The analysis of quotas under perfect competition proceeds much like our graphical treatment of tariffs, in the previous chapter. In panel (a) of Figure 8.1 we show the domestic demand D and supply curve S, together with the constant world price  $\mathfrak{p}^*$ . Under free trade, domestic demand is at  $c_0$  and supply at  $y_0$ , so imports are  $m_0 = c_0 - y_0$ . The import demand curve  $M = D - S$  is shown in panel (b), together with the horizontal export supply curve X at the world price  $p^*$ . These intersect at the equilibrium imports  $m_0$ .

Now suppose that an import quota of  $\overline{\mathbf{X}}$  is imposed, meaning that the quantity imported cannot exceed this amount. This effectively established a vertical export supply curve denoted by  $\overline{\mathbf{X}}$  in panel (b), which now intersects import demand at  $\mathfrak{m}_1$  with the price of  $\mathfrak{p}_1$ . In panel (a), the price of  $\mathfrak{p}_1$  leads to increased supply of  $\mathbf{y}_1$  and reduced demand of  $\mathsf{d}_1$ . Notice that there would be an equivalent effect on price, consumption and production if instead the government had imposed a tariff of  $\mathsf{t} \equiv \mathsf{p}_1 - \mathsf{p}_0$ . In this sense, for every quota there is an equivalent tariff.

The welfare change from having the quota in Figure 8.1 is:  $-(a + b + c + d)$  consumer surplus loss  $+(a)$  producer surplus gain. However, the area (c), which would be collected as revenue under a tariff, now needs to be considered more carefully. This area is the difference between the domestic price  $p_1$  and the world price  $p^*$ . Therefore, whoever is actually importing the good stands to collect the pure profits or "rents" equal to  $(p_1 - p^*)m_1$ , which is area (c). There are four possible ways that these quota rents can be allocated.

Figure 8.2: Large Country

First, the quota licenses can be given to home firms, who are then able to import at the world price  $p^*$  and sell domestically at  $p_1$ , earning the difference between these as rents. An example of this is the dairy industry in the United States, where U.S. producers of cheese also receive licenses to import from abroad. $^1$  With home firms earning the rents  $c$ , the net loss in domestic welfare due to the quota is  $-(a + b + c + d)$  consumer surplus loss  $(a + c)$  producer surplus gain  $= -(b + d)$ , which is the same loss as we found for a tariff.

However, a second possibility is that while the quota licenses are given to home firms, these firms engage in some kind of inefficient activities in order to obtain the licenses. For example, if licenses for some imported input are allocate in proportion to the previous year's production of a final good, then firms will produce more final goods than they can sell (and probably of lower quality) just to obtain the import licenses. Krueger (1974) called this kind of activity "rent seeking," and it can include lobbying and other resource-using activities. It has been suggested that the waste of resources devoted to rent seeking activities could be as large as the value of rents themselves, so that the area (c) would be wasted rather than accrue to domestic firms. In that case, the welfare loss due to the quota would be  $-(a + b + c + d)$  consumer surplus loss  $+(a)$  producer surplus gain  $= -(b + d + c)$ , which is greater than for the tariff.[2]

Third, the quota licenses can be auctioned by the government of the importing country. This has occurred in New Zealand, for example. In a well-organized auction, we might expect that the revenue collected would equal the value of the rents, so that area (c) accrues to the home government. In that case, the net loss in domestic welfare due to the quota is  $-(a + b + c + d)$

consumer surplus loss +(a) producer surplus gain +(c) auction revenue = - $(b+d)$ , which is again the same loss as we found for a tariff.

Finally, the government of the importing country can give authority for implementing the quota to the government of the exporting country. Because the exporting country allocates the quota among its own producers, this is sometimes called a "voluntary" export restraint (VER), or "voluntary" restraint agreements (VRA). This arrangement has occurred for quotas that the United States has used in automobiles, steel, textiles, and other industries. In automobile imports for Japan after 1981, for example, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) told each auto manufacturer in Japan how much it could export to the U.S. We have discussed the background to this case in the previous chapter, and will analyze it in detail later in this chapter. At this point, we note that the quota rents are then earned by foreign producers, so the loss in domestic welfare equals:  $-(a + b + c + d)$  consumer surplus loss  $+(a)$  producer surplus gain  $= -(b + d + c)$ , which is larger than for a tariff. $^4$

In Figure 8.2 we extend the analysis of the quota to a large country. In that case the quota rents might be measured as (c) or  $(\mathrm{c} + \mathrm{e})$ , and these accrue to the foreign producers under a VER. The deadweight loss for the importing country is still measured by area  $(\mathrm{b} + \mathrm{d})$ , and it can be argued that the area (f) represents an analogous deadweight loss for the foreign country. In Table 8.1 we present some estimates of the home and foreign deadweight loss, along with the rents, for major U.S. quotas around 1985. In all cases except diary, these rents were earned by foreign exporters. We will be discussing the case of automobiles later in the chapter, and estimates of the quota rents earned by foreigners range from \$2 to 8 billion. Textiles and apparel

# Notes:

- In dairy the quota rents are earned by U.S. importers, and so are not included in the total. n.a. – not available

also have very large quota rents and U.S. deadweight losses (about  \$5 billion each), under the global system of quotas known as the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA). The foreign deadweight losses due the MFA are even larger, with estimates ranging from$ 4 to $16 billion. The upper end of these estimates is obtained from models that include very costly rent-seeking activities by foreign producers in developing countries.

Summing the costs shown in Table 8.1, the total deadweight loss due to these quotas is in the range of  $8 to$ 12 billion annually in the mid-1980s, while the quota rents transferred to foreigners are another  $7 to$ 17 billion annually. Some of these costs for the U.S. are no longer relevant today: the quota in automobiles ceased to be binding after 1987, as discussed later in the chapter, and under the Uruguay Round of the WTO it was agreed that the MFA would be dismantled. But that action is being delayed until 2005, and even for automobiles, there is always the possibility of new trade actions.[5] The quotas in the steel industry whose costs are summarized in Table 8.1 have been recently replaced by tariffs, instead (as described at the end of chapter 7). In addition, the "average tariffs" included in the last row of Table 8.1 reflect only conventional tariffs, and does not include the additional cost due to U.S. anti-dumping duties (estimated as some \$4 billion annually, also discussed at the end of chapter 7). In summary, the quotas and tariffs/duties used by the U.S. continue to impose a significant cost on itself and on foreign trading partners.

# Non-Equivalence Due to Imperfect Competition

We have shown above the equivalence of tariffs and quotas, in the sense that when each instrument is chosen to have the same import level, then it also has the same impact on prices. When there is imperfect competition in the domestic market, however, this result quickly breaks

down. The reason is that the quota creates a “sheltered” market for the domestic firm, which will lead to higher prices and lower sales than under a tariff with same level of imports. For the case of a domestic monopoly, as analyzed by Bhagwati (1965), this is demonstrated in Figure 8.3.

With the fixed world price of  $\mathfrak{p}^*$ , the demand curve facing the domestic monopolist is essentially horizontal at that price, so marginal revenue is also horizontal and the profit-maximizing quantity is  $y_0$ , where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Note that this is the same quantity that a competitive firm or industry would produce if it had the same marginal costs as the monopolist. In this sense, free trade in a small country eliminates the market power of the monopolist, i.e. eliminates its ability to restrict supply and raise price. This is a potential extra source of gains from trade.

Suppose initially that a tariff of  $t$  is applied to imports. In that case, the domestic monopolist can charge as much as  $p^* + t$ , but no more, so its demand curve is now horizontal at that price. This means that its marginal revenue curve is also horizontal at  $p^* + t$ , so the profit-maximizing quantity is where that price equals marginal cost, which is  $y_1$  in Figure 8.3.

Consumption at that price is  $c_1$ , so imports are  $m_1 = c_1 - y_1$ .

Now suppose that instead of the tariff, a quota of  $\mathfrak{m}_1$  is applied. This means that for any price above  $\mathfrak{p}^*$ , the fixed amount  $\mathfrak{m}_1$  will be imported, so the demand curve facing the monopolist is the initial demand curve  $D$  less the amount  $\mathfrak{m}_1$ , which we illustrate by  $D - M_1$ . Unlike the situation under the tariff, the monopolist retains the ability to influence the domestic price: it can choose the optimal price and quantity along  $D - M_1$ . So we graph the marginal revenue curve below  $D - M_1$ , which is denoted by MR, and find the profit-maximizing price and

quantity where this intersects marginal cost, at  $p_2$  and  $y_2$ . It will definitely be the case that  $p_2 > p^{*} + t$ , so that the quota with the same level of imports as the tariff has led to a higher domestic price. Therefore, the tariff and quota are no longer equivalent: the quota enables the monopolist to exercise market power, and has a higher welfare cost for this reason.

It is also the case that the quota might even lead to a fall in domestic output as compared to free trade. This is illustrated in Figure 8.3 by  $y_2 < y_0$ . This is not a necessary result, and we could instead have drawn the MR curve so that  $y_2 > y_0$ . It is rather surprising that  $y_2 < y_0$  is even possible, because it suggests that workers in the industry would fail to be protected by the quota: that is, employment could fall due to the reduction in output under the quota. We see, then, that this policy instrument has quite undesirable results as compared to a tariff.

These results of Bhagwati (1965) give us good insight into the effect of a tariff versus a quota under imperfect competition, but the assumption that the domestic monopoly does not interact at all with foreign firms is not satisfactory. Presumably, the domestic firm would be competing with foreign firms, under Cournot or Bertrand competition. In the first case, Cournot-Nash competition, the import quota has rather predictable effects: restricting the foreign firms to sell less than its free trade amount will shift sales towards the domestic firm, under the normal shape of reaction curves. In order to obtain more dramatic results, we instead consider an import quota (restricting quantity) in a game where the two firms are initially engaged in Bertrand competition (taking each other's prices as given). This case has been analyzed by Harris (1985) and Krishna (1989), and we follow the exposition of Harris.

As in the previous chapter, we assume that the imported and domestic products are

imperfect substitutes, and denote their prices by  $p$  and  $q$ , respectively. The amount exported by the foreign firm is  $x$ , and sold by the domestic firm is  $y$ . Under the assumption that the elasticity of demand for each product is increasing in the relative price of that product, the reaction curves  $p = r^*(q, \tau)$  and  $q = r(p)$  both slope upwards, with profits increasing in the directions shown in Figure 8.4(a). As the relative price of the competing good rises, the elasticity falls, and each firm will charge a higher price for their own good. Furthermore, there is a dampened response of each price to that of the competing good, so that  $\frac{dp}{dq} \frac{q}{p} = r_q^*(q, \tau) \frac{q}{p} < 1$ , and  $\frac{dq}{dp} \frac{p}{q} = r_p(p) \frac{p}{q} < 1$ . In addition, under weak additional conditions the demand for each good will increase along its own reaction curve, as also illustrated in Figure 8.4(a).

The Bertrand equilibrium under free trade occurs at point B. Suppose then that the foreign firm faces a "voluntary" export restraint (VER) on sales to the domestic market, of the amount  $\mathrm{x(p,q)} \leq \overline{\mathrm{x}}$ . To make the argument as clear as possible, suppose further that the quota limit  $\overline{\mathrm{x}}$  is set at the free trade level of exports, obtained at point B. Then what will be the response of the domestic and foreign firms to this export restraint? To answer this, let us graph the prices at which the constraint  $\mathrm{x(p,q)} \leq \overline{\mathrm{x}}$  holds, as done in Figure 8.4(b). This constraint holds by choice of  $\overline{\mathrm{x}}$  at the Bertrand equilibrium. If we moved up the foreign reaction curve  $\mathrm{R}^{*}\mathrm{R}^{*}$ , then export sales  $\mathrm{x}$  increase, so the constraint is violated. Accordingly, the constraint will hold at lower values of  $\mathrm{p}$ , as illustrated by the line  $\mathrm{B}\overline{\mathrm{X}}$  in Figure 8.4(b).

The fact that the foreign firm is restricted to sell  $\mathrm{x}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q}) \leq \overline{\mathrm{x}}$  is common knowledge among all firms. In this situation, it is no longer appropriate to suppose that the firms engage in Bertrand competition, treating the prices of the other firm as fixed. In particular, the domestic

firm will realize that if it raises its price and shifts export sales towards the foreign firm, thereby leading to  $\mathrm{x(p,q) > \overline{x}}$ , then the foreign firms will have no choice but to increase its own price to restore  $\mathrm{x(p,q) = \overline{x}}$ . The reaction curve of the foreign firm is therefore  $\mathrm{R}^* \mathrm{B}\overline{\mathrm{X}}$  (shown in bold). We can expect the domestic firms to take advantage of the export restraint and increase its prices, knowing that the foreign firm will have to respond. Essentially, the VER gives the domestic firm a "first mover advantage" in selecting its price, so it can act like a Stackelberg leader relative to the reaction curve of the foreign firm.

By this reasoning, the optimal action by the domestic firm will be to increase its price until an iso-profit curve is tangent to the constraint  $\mathrm{B}\overline{\mathrm{X}}$ , as shown at point S in Figure 8.4(b). This movement clearly increases the profits of the home firm, from  $\pi_{\mathrm{B}}$  to  $\pi_{\mathrm{S}}$ . Furthermore, the discrete increase in prices from point B to point S is much different from what we would expect from a tariff: since imports are equal at points B and S, a zero tariff would have the same impact on imports as the export restraint, but obviously no impact at all on prices. So as in the analysis of Bhagwati (1965), the quota has a much greater impact on import and domestic prices than would a tariff at the same level of imports.

What is new in the duopoly model is to realize that the foreign firm also benefits from the export restraint. This is clear from Figure 8.4(b) when exports are limited to the free trade level: profits of the foreign firm increase from  $\pi_{\mathrm{B}}^{*}$  to  $\pi_{\mathrm{S}}^{*}$ . Harris (1985) refers to this as a reason why export restraints are "voluntary," and Krishna (1989) refers to the export restraint as a "facilitating practice," i.e. it facilitates a more collusive outcome between the firms. Notice that if we consider a quota at less than the free trade level of exports, however, then the profits of the

foreign firm do not necessarily go up. $^{9}$  In any case, the losers from the export restraint are home consumers who are paying a higher price for the domestic good and imports, without the benefits of tariff revenue. This begs the question of why a government would ever use a VER rather than a tariff. One answer is that the VER may prevent retaliation from the foreign government, since its own firms may be gaining from the trade restriction.

# Nonequivalence Due to Quality Choice

We turn now to a second reason for tariffs and quotas to differ, and that is due to the choice of product quality for the exporting firms. We think of quality as a characteristic of a product, which brings higher utility for consumers but also has higher costs for the firm. If an exporting firm is constrained in the quantity that it exports, how will this affect its choice of quality or product characteristics? Our argument in this section is that, under certain conditions, it will be optimal for the firm to increase product quality in response to the quota, whereas it would not do so with an ad valorem tariff.

To develop this argument, we will suppose that there are  $i = 1,\dots,N$  varieties of a differentiated product, each of which have characteristics given by the vector  $z_{i}$ . As in our treatment of monopolistic competition in chapter 5, we will suppose that the demand for these product varieties arises from an aggregate utility function, now given by:

$$
\mathrm {U} \left[ f \left(\mathrm {z} _ {1}\right) \mathrm {c} _ {1}, \dots , f \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {N}}\right) \mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {N}} \right], \tag {8.1}
$$

where  $c_i$  denotes the consumption of each variety,  $i = 1, \dots, N$ , and the function  $f(z_i)$  converts the vector of characteristics into a scalar "quality," which then multiplies consumption. Several

features of the aggregate utility function in (8.1) deserve comment.

First, if we recognize that the product varieties are actually bought by different individuals, is it still legitimate to use an aggregate utility function like (8.1)? This question has been answered in the affirmative by McFadden (1978, 1983) and Anderson, de Palma and Thisse (1992). McFadden provides a very general aggregation theorem that applies to behavior of individuals making choices over a discrete number of products, where they each purchase one unit of their optimal variety. Anderson, de Palma and Thisse show that there is an equivalence between three models of product differentiation: the "address" or characteristics approach; the "random utility" approach; and the "love of variety" or representative consumer approach. We discuss McFadden's aggregation theorem and extensions in Appendix B, which allow us to use an aggregate utility function like (8.1).

Specific functional forms can also be obtained. One case that we shall consider is the CES aggregate utility function:

$$
\mathrm {U} = \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \left[ f \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right) \mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {i}} \right] ^ {(\sigma - 1) / \sigma}, \tag {8.2}
$$

again defined over the consumption  $c_i$  of each good times its quality  $f(z_i)$ . The fact that the CES utility function can arise from a discrete choice problem by individuals is demonstrated by Anderson, de Palma and Thisse (1989; 1992, pp. 85-90), provided that individuals consume continuous amounts of the differentiated good. A more conventional assumption is that they must consume zero or one unit, and in that case, the aggregate demands obtained are the "logit" formulation. We shall use those alternative demand functions at the end of the chapter.

Given that an aggregate utility function exists, however, it is still very special to suppose that the product characteristics and consumption enter in the separable form shown in (8.1), i.e.

in the form  $\mathrm{f(z_i)c_i}$ , which we can interpret as "quality times quantity." This functional form implies that every unit consumed of good i is evaluated at the same quality. This form of the utility function was used by Swan (1970), but criticized as being too special by Spence (1975). Spence uses the more general formulation  $\phi (\mathbf{z}_i,\mathbf{c}_i)$ , under which the marginal utility of characteristics per unit consumed,  $\phi_{\mathrm{Z}}(\mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{i}},\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}) / \mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , can vary with the level of consumption  $\mathbf{c}_{\mathrm{i}}$ . If we interpret demand as coming from different individuals, then  $\phi_{\mathrm{Z}}(\mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{i}},\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}) / \mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}$  depending on  $\mathbf{c}_{\mathrm{i}}$  means that consumers have differing valuations of characteristics. We will use the special form  $\mathrm{f(z_i)c_i}$  for convenience, but as we shall repeatedly emphasize, the results that we obtain on quality upgrading will not necessarily carry over to more general functional forms.

# Free Trade Equilibrium

We begin by analyzing the problem for consumers and firms in the absence of any quota restriction. Consumers are presented with a set of  $i = 1, \dots, N$  varieties, with fixed characteristics  $z_i$  and prices  $p_i$ , and then choose the optimal quantity of each variety. It will be convenient to work with the "quality adjusted" prices, which are defined by  $q_i \equiv p_i / f(z_i)$ . That is, the higher is overall product quality  $f(z_i)$ , the lower are the quality-adjusted prices  $q_i$ . The aggregate consumer maximizes utility in (8.1), subject to the budget constraint  $\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i c_i \leq I$ . The Lagrangian for this problem is,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {L} = \mathrm {U} [ \mathrm {f} (\mathrm {z} _ {1}) \mathrm {c} _ {1}, \dots , \mathrm {f} (\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {N}}) \mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {N}} ] + \lambda (\mathrm {I} - \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {i}}) \\ = \mathrm {U} \left(\mathrm {d} _ {1}, \dots , \mathrm {d} _ {\mathrm {N}}\right) + \lambda \left(\mathrm {I} - \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {d} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right), \tag {8.3} \\ \end{array}
$$

where the second line of (8.3) follows by defining  $\mathrm{d_i} \equiv \mathrm{f(z_i)c_i}$  as the effective "quality-adjusted" demand, and also using the quality-adjusted prices  $\mathrm{q_i} \equiv \mathrm{p_i / f(z_i)}$ . This re-writing of the Lagrangian makes it clear that instead of choosing  $\mathrm{c_i}$  given prices  $\mathrm{p_i}$  and characteristics  $\mathrm{z_i}$ , we can instead think of the aggregate consumer as choosing  $\mathrm{d_i}$  given quality-adjusted prices  $\mathrm{q_i}$ ,  $\mathrm{i = 1,\ldots,N}$ . Let us denote the solution to problem (8.3) by  $\mathrm{d_i(q,I)}$ , where  $\mathbf{q}$  is the vector of quality-adjusted prices.

Varieties of the differentiated product can be sold by domestic and foreign firms, which we do not distinguish in the notation. Producing one unit of product  $i$  with characteristics  $z_i$  requires unit-costs of  $g_i(z_i)$ , where we are treating factor prices as constant and suppress them in this cost function. $^{10}$  For simplicity, we are assuming constant returns to scale, so that the costs  $g(z_i)$  do not depend on the level of output. Firms simultaneously choose prices  $p_i$  and characteristics  $z_i$ , for the  $i = 1,\dots,N$  varieties. Suppose that a given firm produces the first  $i = 1,\dots,M$  product varieties. Consumption of each of these is  $c_i = d_i(q, I)/f(z_i)$ . The profit-maximization problem for this firm is then:

$$
\max  _ {\mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}} \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \left[ \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right) \right] \mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {i}} = \max  _ {\mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}} \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \left[ \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {i}} - \frac {\mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right)}{\mathrm {f} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right)} \right] \mathrm {d} _ {\mathrm {i}} (\mathrm {q}, \mathrm {I}). \tag {8.4}
$$

Again, we have changed the variables from nominal prices  $p_i$  to quality-adjusted prices  $q_i$  when

moving from the left to the right of (8.4). This transformation relies on our assumption that prices and characteristics are chosen simultaneously, as well as our special functional forms.

It is immediate that to maximize profits in (8.4), the firms must minimize  $\mathrm{g_i(z_i) / f(z_i)}$ , which is interpreted as the costs per unit of quality for good i. Taking logs and minimizing this over the choice of characteristics  $z_{i}$  leads to the first-order conditions,

$$
\frac {1}{f \left(z _ {i}\right)} \frac {\partial f}{\partial z _ {i}} = \frac {1}{g _ {i} \left(z _ {i}\right)} \frac {\partial g _ {i}}{\partial z _ {i}}, \quad i = 1, \dots , M. \tag {8.5}
$$

Thus, we obtain equality between the relative marginal utility from each characteristic, on the left of (8.5), and its relative marginal cost, on the right. Notice that this condition holds despite the fact that the firm will be choosing its prices in a monopolistically competitive fashion, provided the prices and characteristics are chosen simultaneously.[11]

Maximizing (8.5) over the choice of prices  $p_i$ , we obtain the first-order conditions,

$$
\mathrm {d} _ {\mathrm {i}} (\mathrm {q}, \mathrm {I}) + \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \left[ \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {j}} - \frac {\mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {j}} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {j}}\right)}{\mathrm {f} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {j}}\right)} \right] \frac {\partial \mathrm {d} _ {\mathrm {j}}}{\partial \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {i}}} = 0, \quad \mathrm {i} = 1, \dots , \mathrm {M}. \tag {8.6}
$$

This expression is slightly more complicated than usual because the firm is selling multiple products  $j = 1, \dots, M$ , and therefore must take into account the effect of a change in price  $q_i$  on all these products. To simplify this, let us consider the case of a CES utility function in (8.2). Then

it can be confirmed that the demand derivatives are symmetric,  $\partial \mathrm{d_i} / \partial \mathrm{q_j} = \partial \mathrm{d_j} / \partial \mathrm{q_i}$ . Using this in (8.6) and dividing by effective demand  $\mathrm{d_i}$ , we can re-express it as:

$$
1 + \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \left[ 1 - \frac {\mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {j}} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {j}}\right)}{\mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {j}}} \right] \frac {\partial \ln \mathrm {d} _ {\mathrm {i}}}{\partial \ln \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {j}}} = 0, \quad \mathrm {i} = 1, \dots , \mathrm {M}. \tag {8.7}
$$

Let us denote the ratio of price to marginal cost for each product by  $\mu_{\mathrm{j}} = \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{j}} / \mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{j}}(\mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{j}}) \geq 1$ . We can see that the expression in brackets in (8.7) equals  $(\mu_{\mathrm{i}} - 1) / \mu_{\mathrm{i}} = [\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{i}}(\mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{i}})] / \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} \geq 0$ , which is the difference between price and marginal cost measured relative to price. This is the Lerner index of monopoly power for a single-product firm, and with price chosen optimally will equal the inverse of its elasticity of demand. To see how this Lerner pricing rule is modified with multi-product firms, let us conjecture a solution where the price-cost ratios are constant across all product sold by the firm in question,  $\mu_{\mathrm{j}} = \mu$ . Then it is immediate that the solution to (8.7) is:

$$
\left(\frac {\mu - 1}{\mu}\right) = - \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \frac {\partial \ln \mathrm {d} _ {\mathrm {i}}}{\partial \ln \mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {- 1}. \tag {8.8}
$$

Expression (8.8) says that the Lerner index for the firm equals the inverse of the sum of demand elasticities. In order for this solution to be valid, we need to have that the sum of elasticities on the right of (8.8) are independent of good  $i$ . That is, an equi-proportional increase in all prices charged by a firm needs to lead to the same percentage drop in demand for any product sold by that firm. It turns out that this condition is satisfied for CES demands, in which case the sum of elasticities are,

$$
- \left(\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {M} \frac {\partial \ln d _ {i}}{\partial \ln q _ {j}}\right) = \sigma + (1 - \sigma) \left(\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {M} \frac {p _ {j} c _ {j}}{I}\right), \tag {8.9}
$$

where  $\sigma > 1$  is the elasticity of substitution between products. The expression on the right of (8.9) is the sum of sales over all products sold by the firm, measured relative to total expenditure I on the differentiated product. In other words, the expression on the right is the total market share of the firm. As the market share grows, the sum of elasticities falls, and the markup of the firm will rise in (8.8).

Using the solution for  $\mu$  from (8.8) and (8.9), the optimal prices of the firm are:

$$
p _ {i} = \mu g _ {i} \left(z _ {i}\right), \quad i = 1, \dots , M. \tag {8.10}
$$

Thus, in this CES case the firm charges the same markups over all products that it sells. This is certainly special and would not carry over to other functional forms. Bresnahan (1981) was the first to estimate a discrete choice model for autos that allowed for differing markups over product sold, and found that higher-priced models tended to have higher percentage markups. Similarly, Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995, 1999), Feenstra and Levinsohn (1995) and Goldberg (1995) use functional forms more general than CES that allow markups to differ across products. These papers go beyond the scope of this chapter, though the theory behind them is discussed in Appendix B, and we shall comment on their empirical findings below.

# Voluntary Export Restraint

Suppose now that the exports of a foreign firm is restricted to not exceed the amount  $\sum_{i=1}^{M} c_i = \sum_{i=1}^{M} d_i / f(z_i) \leq \overline{X}$ , where  $\overline{X}$  is the quota amount. Under the VER on Japanese autos, for example, the amounts  $\overline{X}$  were allocated to each Japanese firm by the Ministry of

International Trade and Industry (MITI). We do not introduce a subscript to denote the foreign firms, but analyze the profit maximization problem for any such firm. The Lagrangian is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} L = \max  _ {q _ {i}, z _ {i}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} \left[ q _ {i} - \frac {g _ {i} \left(z _ {i}\right)}{f \left(z _ {i}\right)} \right] d _ {i} \left(q _ {i}, I\right) + \lambda \left(\bar {X} - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} \frac {d _ {i} (q , I)}{f _ {i} \left(z _ {i}\right)}\right) \tag {8.11} \\ = \max  _ {q _ {i}, z _ {i}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} \left[ q _ {i} - \frac {g _ {i} \left(z _ {i}\right) + \lambda}{f \left(z _ {i}\right)} \right] d _ {i} (q, I) + \lambda \overline {{X}}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where the second line follows by simply combining terms. Thus, to maximize profits, it is now the case that the foreign firms will choose characteristics  $z_i$  to minimize  $[g_i(z_i) + \lambda] / f(z_i)$ . Taking logs, the first order condition for this minimization problem is:

$$
\frac {1}{f \left(z _ {i}\right)} \frac {\partial f}{\partial z _ {i}} = \frac {1}{\left[ g _ {i} \left(z _ {i}\right) + \lambda \right] \partial z _ {i}}, \quad i = 1, \dots , M. \tag {8.12}
$$

Thus, in contrast to the first-order condition in (8.5), we no longer obtain an equality between relative marginal utility and marginal costs of characteristics. This equality is broken by the binding quota constraint, and higher value of  $\lambda$  will be associated with higher levels of characteristics chosen by the firm. To see this, totally differentiate (8.12) with respect to  $z_{i}$  and  $\lambda$  to obtain:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}}{\mathrm {d} \lambda} = \frac {1}{\left[ \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right) + \lambda \right] ^ {2}} \left[ \frac {\partial^ {2} \ln \left(\mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {i}} + \lambda\right)}{\partial \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2}} - \frac {\partial^ {2} \ln \mathrm {f}}{\partial \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2}} \right] ^ {- 1} \frac {\partial \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {i}}}{\partial \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}} . \tag {8.13}
$$

The matrix of second derivatives shown in brackets on the right of (8.13) is positive definite from the second-order conditions for minimizing  $\left[\mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{i}}\left(\mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{i}}\right) + \lambda \right] / \mathrm{f}\left(\mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ . While this does not

establish the sign of the vector  $\mathrm{dz_i / d\lambda}$ , notice that we can pre-multiply (8.13) by the row vector  $\partial \mathrm{f} / \partial \mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{i}}^{\prime}$ , which from (8.12) is proportional to the vector  $\partial \mathrm{g_i} / \partial \mathrm{z_i}'$ . Then we will obtain a positive definite matrix that is pre- and post-multiplied by vectors that are proportional, and is therefore positive:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d f} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right)}{\mathrm {d} \lambda} = \frac {\partial \mathrm {f} ^ {\prime}}{\partial \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}} \frac {\mathrm {d z} _ {\mathrm {i}}}{\mathrm {d} \lambda} > 0, \quad \mathrm {i} = 1, \dots , \mathrm {M}. \tag {8.14}
$$

Thus, overall product quality is increased for every product sold by foreign firms due to the export restraint. This is our first demonstration of the idea that quotas lead to an increase in product quality. $^{13}$  Notice that this would not occur under an ad valorem tariff, however. In that case the profit-maximization problem (8.4) would be re-written as:

$$
\max  _ {\mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}} \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \left[ \frac {\mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {i}}}{(1 + \tau)} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right) \right] \mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {i}} = \max  _ {\mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {i}}, \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}} \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \left[ \frac {\mathrm {q} _ {\mathrm {i}}}{(1 + \tau)} - \frac {\mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right)}{\mathrm {f} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}}\right)} \right] \mathrm {d} _ {\mathrm {i}} (\mathrm {q}, \mathrm {I}), \tag {8.4'}
$$

where  $\tau$  is the ad valorem tariff. Changes in the tariff would have no effect at all on the optimal choice of characteristics in (8.5), which continues to hold.

There is also a second sense in which product quality is increased, and that comes from looking at demand across product varieties sold by a firm, rather than at the characteristics within each variety. To motivate this, let us solve for the optimal prices that come from the Lagrangian in (8.11). Assuming again that the utility and demand functions are CES, the

optimal prices are increased according to the Lagrange multiplier on the export restraint:  $^{14}$

$$
p _ {i} = \mu \left[ g _ {i} \left(z _ {i}\right) + \lambda \right], \quad i = 1, \dots , M, \tag {8.15}
$$

where  $\mu$  is once again the markup charged on all product sold by the firm, as solved from (8.8) and (8.9). With  $\lambda$  and  $\mu$  both common across all products sold by a firm, we see that the effect of the VER is to introduce a dollar price increase of  $\mu \lambda$  to the price of every product sold. In other words, the VER acts in the same way as a specific price increase, and not like a proportional price increase across products.[15]

Now consider two products sold by the firm,  $i = 1,2$ , with marginal costs higher for product 1,  $g_1(z_1) > g_2(z_2)$ . In the absence of the VER, prices will be  $p_1 = \mu g_1(z_1) > p_2 = \mu g_2(z_2)$ , and it is natural to refer to the more expensive product 1 as having higher quality. Suppose that the quota is applied, and so that prices rise by the same dollar amount as in (8.15). Holding characteristics fixed, the new prices will be  $p_1' = \mu'[g_1(z_1) + \lambda]$ , and  $p_2' = \mu'[g_2(z_2) + \lambda]$ , where we allow for the fact that due to the VER the markup  $\mu$  can change to  $\mu'$ . Notice that the ratio of prices becomes  $(p_1'/p_2') = [g_1(z_1) + \lambda]/[g_2(z_2) + \lambda] < g_1(z_1)/g_2(z_2) = p_1/p_2$ , where the inequality is obtained because  $g_1(z_1) > g_2(z_2)$ . In other words, the same dollar increase in both prices will lead to a smaller percentage increase in the higher-priced product.

Assuming that there are just two goods and the utility function is homothetic, then the ratios of demands  $\mathrm{d}_1 / \mathrm{d}_2$  depends only on the price ratio  $\mathrm{q}_1 / \mathrm{q}_2$ , and is decreasing in this relative price. With characteristics constant, the fall in  $\mathrm{p}_1 / \mathrm{p}_2$  will reduce  $\mathrm{q}_1 / \mathrm{q}_2$ , which will shift demand

towards the higher-priced product so that  $\mathrm{d}_1 / \mathrm{d}_2$  increases. This shift towards the higher-quality product corresponds to an increase in average quality. Furthermore, notice that the change in average quality would not occur with an ad valorem tariff, since that would have no impact on the relative price.

The above description of quality upgrading due to shifts in demand is called the "Washington apples" effect, after the example given by Alchian and Allen (1964, pp. 74-75). They noted that while the state of Washington grows apples of many varieties, it appeared that the best apples were shipped the furthest distance, to east coast markets. This is explained by treating the transport costs as the same for each apple. Transport therefore acts like a specific price increase, which lowers the relative price of the higher-quality apples in more distance markets. Accordingly, we expect to see the best apples shipped to the east coast, which raises the average quality in those markets.

In summary, there are two reasons to expect import quality to rise with a quota on the number of units sold: due to the increase in characteristics chosen by the exporting firms; and due to the shift in demand towards the higher-quality products. These two effects can certainly work together. In the model above, the demands  $\mathrm{d_i(q_i,I)}$  for quality-adjusted consumption  $\mathrm{f(z_i)c_i}$ , are determined by the quality-adjusted prices  $\mathrm{q_i\equiv p_i / f(z_i)}$ . So let us see how these prices are affected by the quota, even as characteristics change.

Using (8.15), the quality-adjusted prices are written as  $q_{i} = \mu [g_{i}(z_{i}) + \lambda] / f_{i}(z_{i})$ . From our discussion following (8.8), we know that  $[g_{i}(z_{i}) + \lambda] / f_{i}(z_{i})$  is minimized over the choice of characteristics  $z_{i}$ . Then by the envelope theorem, when differentiating this expression we can

treat the characteristics as fixed. Accordingly, we can compute the change in quality-adjusted prices due to the quota as:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d} \ln q _ {\mathrm {i}}}{\mathrm {d} \lambda} = \frac {\mathrm {d} \ln \mu}{\mathrm {d} \lambda} + \frac {1}{\left[ g _ {\mathrm {i}} \left(z _ {\mathrm {i}}\right) + \lambda \right]} = \frac {\mathrm {d} \ln \mu}{\mathrm {d} \lambda} + \frac {\mu}{p _ {\mathrm {i}}} . \tag {8.16}
$$

The first term on the right of (8.16) is the change in markup due to the VER, which is common across products, while the second term is smallest for the highest-priced products. Therefore, we will observe the smallest relative increase in quality-adjusted price for those products with the highest prices. This can be expected to shift demand towards the highest-priced products, just as in the "Washington apples" effect.

# Measuring Quality-Upgrading Due to Quotas

We turn now to an application of the above theory to "voluntary export restraint" (VER) imposed on Japanese autos by the United State. Recall that with unemployment in the automobile industry growing in the 1979-80 and profits falling, Ford Motor Company and the UAW applied to the U.S. ITC for section 201 protection. This application was denied on the grounds that the U.S. recession appeared to be a greater cause of unemployment and falling profits than were rising imports from Japan.

Faced with this negative outcome, several congressmen from mid-western states pursued protection for automobiles via other means. Senators Danforth and Bentsen introduced a bill to restrict imports, which would have restricted Japanese automobiles imports into the U.S. to 1.6 million units during 1981, 1982 and 1983. Indeed, this bill was scheduled for revision in the Senate Finance Committee on May 12, 1981. Clearly aware of this pending legislation, the Japanese government announced on May 1 that it would "voluntarily" limit the sales of

automobiles in the U.S. market. For the period April 1981 – March 1982, this limit was set at 1.83 million autos, including 1.68 million cars exported to the U.S., 82,500 utility vehicles, and 70,000 vehicles exported to Puerto Rico. This limit was in place until March 1984, after which it was raised to 2.02 and then 2.51 million vehicles annually until March 1992, as shown in Table 8.2 where we compare the actual imports with the VER limits. It is evident that the VER was nearly exactly satisfied in early years, and remained binding until 1987. After that, however, actual imports were below the VER so that by March 1994 it was discontinued. The reason that imports fell below the VER after 1987 was because Japanese companies had begun assembling cars in the United States, so imports naturally fell.

Our interest, then, is in the effects of the VER during the early years. To estimate the change in product quality, initially consider the case where there is no VER. Assuming that marginal costs take the form  $\ln \mathrm{g_i(z_{it})} = \beta '\mathrm{z_{it}} + \xi_{it}$ , where  $\xi_{it}$  is a random error that reflects unmeasured characteristics, and we add the subscript  $t$  to denote years. Then the first order condition (8.10) is written in logs as:

$$
\ln p _ {i t} = \alpha_ {t} + \beta^ {\prime} z _ {i t} + \xi_ {i t}, \quad i = 1, \dots , M, \tag {8.17}
$$

where  $\alpha_{t} = \ln \mu_{t}$  reflects the markups. We should also be indexing  $\alpha_{t}$  by firms (since the markups differ across firms), but will omit this notation. Equation (8.17) is a log-linear regression of prices on characteristics and is called a "hedonic regression." Our derivation shows that this is a valid representation of the equilibrium under imperfect competition provided that markups are the same across products (as in the CES case). Furthermore, using the equality between relative marginal utility from each characteristic, on the left of (8.5), and relative marginal cost on the right, we can interpret the coefficients  $\beta$  in (8.17) in either way.

# Notes:

This table reports U.S. imports of cars and sport-utility vehicles from Japan, including imports to Puerto Rico.

a Computed as 1.68 million cars to the U.S., 82,500 utility vehicles to the U.S., and 70,000 vehicles to Puerto Rico.

b Of the 2.106 million total, 1.85 million were cars sold to the U.S.

c Of the 2.506 million total, 2.30 million were cars sold to the U.S.

Under the VER, the first order condition becomes (8.15). For the same specification of marginal costs,  $\ln \mathrm{g_i(z_{it})} = \beta '\mathrm{z_{it}} + \xi_{it}$ , this is re-written as:

$$
p _ {i t} = \exp \left(\alpha_ {t} + \beta^ {\prime} z _ {i t} + \xi_ {i t}\right) + s _ {t}, \quad i = 1, \dots , M, \tag {8.18}
$$

where  $\alpha_{\mathrm{t}} = \ln \mu_{\mathrm{t}}$  are the markups and  $s_t = \mu_t\lambda_t$  are the specific price increases due to the VER.

To convert the random error to an additive form, define:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \varepsilon_ {\mathrm {i t}} = \exp \left(\alpha_ {\mathrm {t}} + \beta^ {\prime} z _ {\mathrm {i t}} + \xi_ {\mathrm {i t}}\right) - \exp \left(\alpha_ {\mathrm {t}} + \beta^ {\prime} z _ {\mathrm {i t}}\right) \tag {8.19} \\ = \left[ \exp \left(\xi_ {\mathrm {i t}}\right) - 1 \right] \exp \left(\alpha_ {\mathrm {t}} + \beta^ {\prime} z _ {\mathrm {i t}}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

Then (8.18) is re-written as:

$$
p _ {i t} = \exp \left(\alpha_ {t} + \beta^ {\prime} z _ {i t}\right) + s _ {t} + \varepsilon_ {i t}, \quad i = 1, \dots , M, \tag {8.20}
$$

Thus, under the VER we need to allow for specific price increases  $s_t$  from year to year, as well as the proportional price changes captured by  $\alpha_t$ .

Feenstra (1988a) estimates these hedonic regressions using a sample of U.S. imports of Japanese cars and trucks. Only cars and utility vehicles were subject to the VER, whereas trucks had a higher tariff imposed in August 1980, as discussed in the previous chapter. Summary statistics for the sample over 1979-1985 are show in Table 8.3. Notice that the unit-value (i.e. average price) of Japanese cars increased by  $20\%$  from 1980 to 1981, which was unusually high, and a further  $10\%$  from 1981 to 1982. We should not attribute this entire amount to the VER, however. The nominal increase in prices can also reflect general inflation, and in addition, increases in the quality of each product. Using the estimates for a hedonic regression, we can define quality as  $(\alpha_0 + \beta'z_{it})$ , which will increase whenever the characteristics  $z_{it}$  rise.

Observing whether this occurred for Japanese autos under the VER, as predicted by the theory, is the goal of the empirical work, as well as to estimate the impact of the VER on prices as measured by the specific price terms  $s_t$ .

An initial estimate of (8.20) for 1979-85, using the base version of each Japanese car model sold in the U.S., is shown in column (1) of Table 8.4. $^{16}$  The coefficients at the top of the table are estimates of  $\beta_{\mathrm{k}}$  for each characteristic k. For example, an increase in width of one foot is estimated to raise the price of a car by  $\exp(0.36) = 1.43$ , while an increase in horsepower of 100 will increase price by  $\exp(0.69) = 2$ , or double the price. In the lower part of the table we report the estimates of  $\alpha_{\mathrm{t}}$ , referred to as the proportional price increases (measured relative to 1979), and then the estimates of  $s_t$ , referred to as the specific price increases (measured relative to 1980). Except for 1985, we see that the specific prices increase are positive but have high standard errors. This is due to the multicollinearity between the terms  $\alpha_{\mathrm{t}}$  and  $s_t$ , both of which are measuring annual price increases.

To address this multicollinearity, we consider pooling data for U.S. imports of Japanese cars and trucks. Denoting trucks with an asterisk, we re-write the hedonic regression (8.17) as,

$$
\ln p _ {i t} ^ {*} = \alpha_ {t} ^ {*} + \beta^ {*} z _ {i t} ^ {*} + \xi_ {i t} ^ {*}, \quad i = 1, \dots , M. \tag {8.21}
$$

Thus, we are allowing truck to have different coefficient on its characteristics than cars, and also differing proportional price increases  $\alpha_{\mathrm{t}}^{*}$ . Because trucks were not subject to the VER, we do

not include any specific price increases in this regression. Estimates of (8.21) using the data on trucks are shown in regression (2) of Table 8.4. $^{17}$

We now consider testing the hypothesis that the year-to-year price changes in Japanese cars and truck exports to the U.S. would be the same, after correcting for the trade policies in each product. Cars were subject to the VER after April 1981, whereas trucks imported from Japan were subject to an increase in the tariff from  $4\%$  to  $25\%$  after August 1980, as discussed in the previous chapter. Feenstra (1988a) argues that the  $21\%$  increase in the wholesale price of trucks as they cross the border would be reflected by at most a  $16\%$  increase in the retail price.[18] Accordingly, we consider testing the hypothesis that the proportional year increase for trucks,  $\alpha_{t}^{*}$ , is 0.16 greater than the proportional year increase for cars,  $\alpha_{t}$ , for 1981 and later years:

$$
\alpha_ {t} ^ {*} = \alpha_ {t} + 0. 1 6 \quad \text {f o r} t = 1 9 8 1, 8 2, \dots , 8 5. \tag {8.22}
$$

Feenstra (1988a) finds that this hypothesis is accepted in all years except 1985, and so it is imposed on the subsequent estimation except for that year.

In columns (3) and (4) of Table 8.4, we re-estimate the regressions for cars and trucks, while imposing the cross-equation restraint (8.22) for  $t = 1981, \ldots, 84$ . Notice that this reduces the standard errors on the specific price increases for cars substantially. By 1984-85, the impact of the VER is to increase the price of cars by about \$1,000 on average. This is an estimate of the pure price increase due to the quota, after correcting for changes in the characteristics of Japanese cars. Multiplying this by the average 1984-85 imports of some 2.2 million, we obtain

an estimate of the quota rents of \$2.2 billion annually in 1984-85.

This estimate equals lower end of the quota rents for autos shown in Table 8.1. Where do the higher estimates come from? It turns out that along with the increase in Japanese car prices, European producers selling in the U.S. also raised their prices substantially – by nearly one-third, as estimated by Dinopoulos and Kreinin (1988). They calculate a U.S. welfare loss due to this increase in European prices of some 3.4 billion in 1984, which exceeds the loss due to quota rents transferred to Japan. This nicely illustrates the result argued by Harris (1985) and Krishna (1989), that a VER will act as a “facilitating practice” and leads to more collusive behavior in the market where it is imposed. For American small cars we also show a substantial increase in prices at the bottom of Table 8.3: by 21\% from 1979-80 and 17\% from 1980-81. Some of this increase occurred before the VER, but it appears that this quota allowed American producers to maintain and continue large prices increases.

What about the change in product quality for Japanese imports? In fact, there was a considerable upgrading of model characteristics at just the time that the VER was imposed. In Table 8.3, we show the "unit-quality," which is computed as  $(\alpha_0 + \beta'z_{it})$  and then averaged across all models. This increases by  $8.8\%$  from 1980 to 1981, and another  $7.9\%$  over 1981-82 and  $7.3\%$  over 1982-83. The dollar increase in quality over 1980-85 is \$1,650, which reflects higher values of the characteristics applied to each model. This vastly exceeds the quality change for trucks or U.S. small cars as shown in Table 8.3. These observations strongly support the theoretical prediction that Japanese producers raised characteristics to increase the quality of cars due to the VER, but this did not occur under the ad valorem tariff in trucks.

Aside from characteristics, recall that there is a second way that average quality can increase following the VER, and that is from shifting demand towards the highest-quality

products because their effective prices have the lowest percentage increase in prices. Evidence supporting this "Washington apples" effect can also be seen from Table 8.3. In addition to the unit-value and unit-quality, we show there a price and quality index. The difference between the unit-value and price index is that the former uses the quantity sold of each car in that year as a weight in forming the average, whereas the price index uses fixed weights from year to year when forming the index.[19] In other words, a shift in demand towards more-expensive models will increase the unit-value, but will have no effect on the price index. It follows that the ratio of the unit-value to the price index can be used as a measure of "product mix," i.e. an increase in the unit-value exceeding the price index indicates that demand has shifted towards more-expensive models.

Returning to Table 8.3, we see that the unit-value indeed increased by more than the price index: the cumulative rise in the unit-value is  $(8,038 - 5,175) / 5,175 = 55.3\%$  over 1980-85, whereas the price index increased by  $47.8\%$ . Similarly, the cumulative rise in the unit-quality is  $(8.5,862 - 4,473) / 4,473 = 37\%$  over 1980-85, whereas the quality index increased by  $30.6\%$ . By either measure, there is a noticeable shift in demand towards the higher-priced and higher-quality cars, as predicted by the "Washington apples" effect. In addition, the change in the quality-adjusted prices (measured by  $\Delta \ln p_{it} - \Delta \beta' z_{it}$ ) are graphed in Figure 8.5, for 1980-1985. It can be seen that many of the highest priced models had below-average increases in the their quality-adjusted price, as predicted by (8.16).

We note that the non-uniform change in prices illustrated in Figure 8.5 can be expected to have a deadweight loss (as compared to a uniform percentage change in prices). A formula for

measured the deadweight is developed in Boorstein and Feenstra (1991), who studied quality upgrading due to the "Washington applies" effect for the quota on U.S. steel imports during 1969-74.[20] That formula was extended to incorporate rising characteristics due to the autos VER by Feenstra (1993), who finds that the deadweight loss is high: between one-quarter and one-third of the value of quality upgrading in each year, or about  \$500 by 1985. This loss is in addition to the foregone rents of about\$ 1,000 per imported Japanese car in 1984-85, which indicates that the deadweight loss of quality change adds a substantial component to the welfare cost of the VER.[21]

Our estimate of the quota rents over 1980-85 can be compared to other studies. Ries (1993) studies the change in stock prices of Japanese auto producers and parts suppliers during the weeks in 1981 when this policy was being formulated. He finds strong evidence of positive returns to the stocks of Japanese auto producers during this period, though only after it became clear that MITI would administer the quotas to each producer (so that they would capture the rents). In contrast, only the largest parts suppliers obtain abnormal stock during this period. Further supportive evidence is obtained by Goldberg (1995), who finds that the VER was binding in 1983-84 and 1986-87, with the highest rents in the earlier years.

The only study to question this conclusion is Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1999) (hereafter BLP), who argue that the VER was not binding in the early years, and became binding in 1986. They obtain the highest estimates for the price effect of the quota (like  $s_t$  in our notation) in the years 1987-90. This is a puzzling finding, since from Table 8.2 we know that Japanese imports fell short of the VER limit during March 1987 – April 1988 and in later years.

Figure 8.5: Quality-Adjusted Price Change in Japanese imports, 1980-85

For the remainder of this section, we discuss possible explanations for the differing findings of Feenstra (1988a) and BLP.

We begin by extending our sample from 1979-1985, as used in the regressions of Table 8.4, to 1979-1990. The new estimates of the car and truck regressions (8.20) and (8.21) are shown in Table 8.5. In column (1) and (2) we report the car and truck regressions without any cross-equation constraints, while in columns (3) and (4) we make use the constraint in (8.22) for  $t = 1981,\ldots ,84$ . As before, making use of this cross-equation constraint is effective in reducing the standard errors of the specific price increases.

Including the additional five years of data turns out to have a substantial impact on some of the hedonic coefficients: for example, the coefficient on width in the car regression is much higher than in Table 8.4, while the coefficient on horsepower is smaller. With this change in the hedonic coefficients, the specific price effect of the VER in the early years is reduced somewhat: in 1984, we estimate a price increase due to the VER of  \$812 in column (3) of Table 8.5, as compared with\$ 1,104 in column (3) of Table 8.4. This price impact in small in 1985 in both tables, but the effect of the VER grows after that and peaks in 1987, where we estimates quotas of \$1,164 per vehicle in column (3) of Table 8.5. So by extending the sample, we find that the VER is still binding in 1987. After that year, however, our estimates give highly imprecise estimates of the price impact of the VER, ranging from positive in column (1) to negative in column (3), but in all cases insignificantly different from zero. Consistent with the fact that Japanese exports to the United States fell short of the VER limit, we do not identify any significant impact of this trade restriction on prices after 1987.

In contrast, BLP continue to find a significant price impact of the VER through 1990, but no significant effect before 1986. I believe that the reason for this has to do with the way that BLP model the supply side of the market. They model marginal costs for Japanese producers as determined by time trends and wages, with the exchange rate entering insignificantly. This formulation predicts that a steady increase in prices would have occurred over 1980-85 even without the VER, so the VER does not appear to be binding in their estimates. But this predicted increase in prices is contradicted by the actual movement in truck prices, which rose due to the tariff in 1980-81 but were quite stable or fell in some years after this (see Table 8.3). The free trade change in car prices that we have used are the same as for trucks, but correcting for the tariff as in (8.22). Therefore, we are using a lower increase in free trade car prices than BLP, which accounts for difference in our findings through 1985.

Like BLP, we find that the VER is binding in 1986 and 1987, but after this time we begin to estimate a rather large proportional increase in car prices, so the specific price effect of the VER becomes smaller and insignificant. In contrast, the free trade increase in prices allowed by BLP is still dominated by the time trends and wages entering marginal costs, and it turns out that these are not enough to explain the actual increase in Japanese prices: hence, they estimate that the VER is binding after 1987, even though actual exports fell short of the VER limit.

# Export Subsidies

We turn now to our second major topic for the chapter, which is the application of export subsidies. These are used by developing and industrial countries alike to support their industries. There is little doubt that these subsidies are welcomed by the firms receiving them, and this might explain their use in a political economy model, as we examine in the next chapter. But in this chapter we are concerned with social welfare, which means that the revenue cost of the

subsidies must be counted against any increase in profits of the receiving industries: only if the revenue cost is less than the net change in producer plus consumer surplus are the subsidies in the national interest. As we shall see, this cannot occur in a two-good model with perfect competition, and after presenting these results we will consider other frameworks.

# Perfect Competition

We consider first the case of a small country, in Figure 8.6. In panel (a) we show the domestic demand D and supply S curves, together with the constant world price  $\mathfrak{p}^*$ . Under free trade, domestic demand is at  $c_{0}$  and supply at  $\mathrm{y_0}$ , so exports are  $\mathrm{x_0 = y_0 - c_0}$ . This is shown in panel (b), which graphs the domestic export supply curve  $\mathrm{X} = \mathrm{S} - \mathrm{D}$ . We can think of the fixed world price  $\mathfrak{p}^*$  as establishing a horizontal import demand curve from the rest of the world, which intersects X at the equilibrium exports  $\mathrm{x_0}$ .

Now suppose that firms in the home industry are given a subsidy of  $s$  dollars per unit exported. With this subsidy, the home industry would be able to earn  $p^* + s$  on all quantities that are exported. Accordingly, firms in this industry would be unwilling to sell at home for anything less than that amount, and the domestic price must also rise to  $p^* + s$ . At this price, domestic demand falls to  $c_1$  and supply rises to  $y_1$ , so exports rise to the amount  $x_1 = y_1 - c_1$ . This corresponds to a rightward shift of the domestic export supply curve in panel (b), because at the same international price of  $p^*$ , exports have increased from  $x_0$  to  $x_1$ . Equivalently, the export supply curve shifts downward, from  $X$  to  $X'$ , by the amount of the subsidy  $s$ .[23]

Figure 8.6: Small Country
(b) Export Market

The welfare effect of the subsidy can be ready calculated in panel (a) as:  $-(a + b)$  consumer surplus loss  $+$ $(a + b + c)$  producer surplus gain -  $(b + c + d)$  subsidy cost  $= -(b + d)$ , which is always negative. Area  $(b + d)$  is the deadweight loss of the subsidy, and is also shown as the triangle under the export supply curve in panel (b). This area is analogous to the deadweight loss that we found for a tariff, in the last chapter. Therefore, the small country also loses due to an export subsidy.

Consider now the case of a large country, in Figure 8.7. In panel (b), we show again the rightward shift of the domestic export supply curve, from X to  $\mathbf{X}^{\prime}$ . Because this country is a large producer in world markets, it faces a downward sloping demand curve  $\mathrm{D}^{*}$  from the rest of the world. Therefore, the rightward shift of its export supply curve leads to a fall in the price of its exports, from  $\mathfrak{p}^{*}$  to  $\mathfrak{p}^{\prime}$ . The exporting country experiences a decline in its terms of trade, which leads to a further welfare loss. In Figure 8.7, the deadweight loss of the export subsidy is still shown by the triangle (b+d), while the terms of trade loss is shown by the rectangle (e), so the welfare loss is the sum of these. So unlike the case of an import tariff, which improved the terms of trade gain and potentially raised welfare for a large country under perfect competition, we see that the export subsidy leads to an unambiguous welfare loss.

# Many Goods

The demonstration above that export subsidies cannot be welfare improving implicitly assumed two goods – the export good in question and another good used to balance trade in the background (for example, the additively separable numeraire good introduced at the beginning of chapter 7). If there are other goods in the economy, then their prices are being held fixed (in terms of the numeraire). But what if there are other goods, whose international prices also change with the export subsidy on the good in question. Is it possible for these other goods to

have a terms of trade gain, which might overcome the terms of trade loss on the good being subsidized? If so, then the exporting country could gain from the subsidy.

Feenstra (1986) considers a three good model where a subsidy on one export, which lowers its price, can nevertheless improve the overall terms of trade for a country and therefore be welfare improving. The condition to ensure this is that the subsidized good and the other export are sufficiently strong complements. In that case, the subsidy can lead to an increase in demand and price for the other export good that is enough to offset the terms of trade loss on the subsidized good. A simple example (not drawn from international trade) is the subsidy to travel, lodging and food offered by many casinos as a way to attract customers: the casino recovers more than enough from gambling revenues to make this subsidy profitable.

The difficulty with the three-good example is that the results are very sensitive to the cross-elasticities in demand and production, and it is difficult for researchers (let alone a government) to have accurate information about these. So is there a case where subsidies might be welfare improving even without relying on detailed elasticity information? It turns out that there is, and this due to Itoh and Kiyono (1987). These authors consider a Ricardian model with a continuum of goods, originally due to Dornbusch, Fisher and Samuelson (1977). We have already use the Heckscher-Ohlin model with a continuum of goods in chapter 3, and the Ricardian version is simpler in that it uses only one factor – labor. Without presenting this model in detail, we will summarize the results found by Itoh and Kiyono.

The assumption of the Ricardian model is that countries differ in their technologies. Denote the continuum of goods by  $z \in [0,1]$ , and let  $a^*(z)$  denote the labor needed per unit of production abroad, while  $a(z)$  is the labor needed per unit of production at home. We order these goods such that  $a^*(z)/a(z)$  is declining in  $z$ , meaning that the home country has a comparative

advantage in the goods of lowest index  $z$ . In equilibrium, the "borderline" good  $z'$  will have prices that are equal across countries, so that  $\mathrm{wa}(z') = \mathrm{w}^* \mathrm{a}^*(z')$ , where  $\mathrm{w}$  and  $\mathrm{w}^*$  are wages at home and abroad. Then the home country will be producing and exporting goods in the range  $[0, z')$ , while the foreign country will be producing and exporting goods in the range  $(z', 1]$ . Notice that relative wages are determined in equilibrium by  $\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w}^* = \mathrm{a}^*(z') / \mathrm{a}(z')$ .

Itoh and Kiyono first consider a home export subsidy of  $s$  to all goods exported. This has the effect of expanding the range of exports from  $[0, z')$  to  $[0, z_1)$ , with  $z_1 > z'$ . The new borderline good satisfies  $[\mathrm{wa}(z_1) - s] = \mathrm{w}^* \mathrm{a}^*(z_1)$ , where  $\mathrm{wa}(z_1)$  is the home price for that good and  $[\mathrm{wa}(z_1) - s]$  is the subsidized export price. Simplifying this equation, relative wages are:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {w}}{\mathrm {w} ^ {*}} - \left(\frac {\mathrm {s}}{\mathrm {w} ^ {*} \mathrm {a} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {1}\right)}\right) = \frac {\mathrm {a} ^ {*} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {1}\right)}{\mathrm {a} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {1}\right)}. \tag {8.23}
$$

As suggested by this equation, the direct effect of an export subsidy is to raise relative home wage. There is also an indirect effect through the increase in  $z_1$ , which lowers  $a^*(z_1) / a(z_1)$ , but the net outcome is still an increase in  $w / w^*$  due to the subsidy  $s > 0$ .

However, with a subsidy granted to all home exports, the increase in relative wages does not lead to a welfare gain. The reason is that the revenue cost of the subsidy is too great: this cost would be a tax on labor, so that home labor earns  $\mathrm{w} - [\mathrm{s} / \mathrm{a}(\mathrm{z}_1)]$  in its after-tax wage. The ratio of this to the wage of foreign workers is shown on the left side of (8.22). But since the right side of (8.22) is declining in  $\mathrm{z}_1$ , then so is the relative after-tax wage on the left. So despite the fact that gross wages are increasing at home, the net after-tax wage falls relative to that abroad with the expansion of  $\mathrm{z}_1$ , so the uniform export subsidy fails to raise home welfare.

Now consider instead a targeted export subsidy  $s(z)$ , which applies only to those goods in a range  $[z_0, z_1]$ , with  $z_0 < z^* < z_1$ . Home workers still receive an increase in their relative wages  $w/w^*$ , as suggested by (8.23). But now the revenue cost of the subsidy can be lowered by suitable choice of the  $z_0$ . All goods below this cutoff do not receive any export subsidy, but since relative home wages have been increased, they will sell in international markets at a higher relative price. Therefore, the increase in home wages corresponds to a terms of trade increase for those goods not receiving the subsidy. Indeed, Itoh and Kiyono demonstrate that by choosing  $z_0$  and  $z_1$  sufficiently close to  $z'$ , the revenue cost of the subsidy is of the second-order of smalls, whereas the terms of trade gain (which applies to all goods in the range  $[0, z_0]$ ), is of the first-order.[24] Therefore, the exporting country is better off.

The idea that a country might gain through targeted export subsidies is an intriguing one, which deserves more attention. Rodrik (1995) is among the few papers that takes targeted subsidies seriously, and he explores the ability of these policies to work in various countries.[25] That paper is recommended for further reading.

# Subsidies With Imperfect Competition

We next consider the effects of export subsidies under imperfect competition. In particular, suppose that a single home firm and a single foreign firm sell to a third market. The standard example here is sales of Boeing versus Airbus to a third market (such as China). We

are interested in whether the home government can give its own firm a "strategic" advantage by subsidizing it. We shall require that the subsidy also be in the national interest, which means that profits for the exporter need to rise by more than the amount of the subsidy itself. We initially assume Cournot-Nash competition, as in Brander and Spencer (1985). Eaton and Grossman (1986) contrast the results from that case to Bertrand competition, as we shall also discuss.

# Cournot Duopoly

We let  $x$  denote the sales of the home firm and  $x^*$  the sales of the foreign firm to the third market. We will treat  $x$  and  $x^*$  as differentiated products, so the home firm earns the price  $p(x, x^*)$  and the foreign firm earns  $p^*(x, x^*)$ . It will be sufficient for our purposes to study the profit maximization of the home firm, as the foreign firm's problem is similar. Home profits from exporting are,

$$
\pi = \mathrm {p} (\mathrm {x}, \mathrm {x} ^ {*}) \mathrm {x} - \mathrm {C} (\mathrm {x}), \tag {8.24}
$$

Maximizing this over the choice of  $\mathbf{x}$ , the first order condition is:

$$
\pi_ {\mathrm {x}} = \mathrm {p} (\mathrm {x}, \mathrm {x} ^ {*}) + \mathrm {x p} _ {\mathrm {x}} - \mathrm {C} ^ {\prime} (\mathrm {x}) = 0, \tag {8.25}
$$

and the second-order condition is  $\pi_{\mathrm{xx}} = 2\mathrm{p_x} + \mathrm{xp}_{\mathrm{xx}} - \mathrm{C}'' < 0$

Using (8.25), we also solve for home exports  $\mathbf{x}$  as a function of foreign sales  $\mathbf{x}^*$ , written as the reaction curve  $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{r}(\mathbf{x}^*)$ . This reaction curve and the foreign counterpart  $\mathbf{x}^* = \mathbf{r}^*(\mathbf{x})$  are graphed as RR and R*R* in Figure 8.8, and their intersection determines the Cournot equilibrium denoted by point C. The typical property of these reaction curves is that they are both downward sloping. For stability, the home reaction curve RR needs to cut the foreign

reaction curve  $\mathbf{R}^{*}\mathbf{R}^{*}$  from above, as illustrated. $^{26}$  Notice that the iso-profit curves of  $\pi$  have higher profits in the downwards direction (i.e. for reduced  $\mathbf{x}^{*}$ ), and similarly the iso-profit curve  $\pi^{*}$  have higher foreign profits in the leftward direction (for reduced  $\mathbf{x}$ ), as illustrated.

Now consider the impact of an export subsidy. Letting  $\mathfrak{p}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}^{*})$  denote the price paid by the buyer and  $s$  denote the specific subsidy, then  $\mathfrak{p}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}^{*}) + s$  is the subsidized price received by the home firm. Home profits are therefore,

$$
\pi = [ p (x, x ^ {*}) + s ] x - C (x). \tag {8.26}
$$

Maximizing this over the choice of  $\mathbf{x}$ , the first order condition is:

$$
\pi_ {\mathrm {x}} = \mathrm {p} (\mathrm {x}, \mathrm {x} ^ {*}) + \mathrm {s} + \mathrm {x p} _ {\mathrm {x}} - \mathrm {C} ^ {\prime} (\mathrm {x}) = 0, \tag {8.27}
$$

where (8.27) defines a new reaction curve  $\mathrm{x} = \mathrm{r}(\mathrm{x}^*,\mathrm{s})$ . To check how this reaction curve depends on the subsidy  $\mathrm{s}$ , totally differentiate (8.27) to obtain,

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {x}}{\mathrm {d} s} = - \frac {1}{\pi_ {\mathrm {x x}}} > 0 ,
$$

where this sign is obtained from the second-order condition for maximizing (8.26).

Thus, in Figure 8.9 the export subsidy unambiguously shifts the home reaction curve to the right, from RR to  $\mathbf{R}^{\prime}\mathbf{R}^{\prime}$ , so the equilibrium moves from point C to point D. Under the case we have shown with both reaction curve downward sloping, this will increase home exports x and reduce foreign exports x*. It is readily confirmed that this will raise home profits, which is not surprising. Our interest is not just in the profits of the home firm, however, but in social welfare, defined as the profits earned by the home firm in the third market minus the revenue

cost of the subsidy.[27] Since the subsidy cost is the amount sx, welfare becomes,

$$
\mathrm {W} = \left[ \mathrm {p} \left(\mathrm {x}, \mathrm {x} ^ {*}\right) + \mathrm {s} \right] \mathrm {x} - \mathrm {C} (\mathrm {x}) - \mathrm {s x} = \mathrm {p} \left(\mathrm {x}, \mathrm {x} ^ {*}\right) \mathrm {x} - \mathrm {C} (\mathrm {x}). \tag {8.28}
$$

Notice that the expression on the right of (8.28) is identical to the original expression for home profits in (8.24). That is, by taking the subsidized profits in (8.26), and subtracting the amount of subsidy, we get back the initial profits. This means that the original iso-profit curves for the home firm, such as illustrated by  $\pi$  in Figure 8.8, now measure social welfare. We therefore re-label these iso-profit contours as W rather than  $\pi$ .

The difference between profits in (8.24) and social welfare in (8.28), however, is that they are evaluated at different equilibrium quantities  $(\mathrm{x},\mathrm{x}^{*})$ . Whereas initial profits are evaluated at point C, the subsidy moves the equilibrium to point D. This clearly increases home welfare (since the W contours are increasing in the downward direction). Indeed, an optimal subsidy would be one for which the welfare contour is just tangent to the foreign reaction curve  $\mathbf{R}^{*}\mathbf{R}^{*}$ , as illustrated in Figure 8.9 at point D. We see that under Cournot-Nash competition, the export subsidy by the home government leads to a welfare improvement.

# Bertrand Duopoly

We now contrast the results obtained above to a Bertrand duopoly, when the home and foreign firms are each choosing prices as the strategic variable, rather than quantities. Denote exports of the home firms to the third market by  $\mathrm{x(p,p^*)}$ , where  $\mathfrak{p}$  is the price paid by the buyer. Letting  $s$  denote the specific subsidy, then  $(p + s)$  is the subsidized price received by the home firm. Home profits are therefore,

$$
\pi = (\mathrm {p} + \mathrm {s}) \mathrm {x} (\mathrm {p}, \mathrm {p} ^ {*}) - \mathrm {C} [ \mathrm {x} (\mathrm {p}, \mathrm {p} ^ {*}) ]. \tag {8.29}
$$

Maximizing this over the choice of  $p$ , the first order condition is:

$$
\pi_ {\mathrm {p}} = \mathrm {x} (\mathrm {p}, \mathrm {p} ^ {*}) + (\mathrm {p} + \mathrm {s}) \mathrm {x} _ {\mathrm {p}} - \mathrm {C} ^ {\prime} (\mathrm {x}) \mathrm {x} _ {\mathrm {p}} = 0. \tag {8.30}
$$

Given the foreign price  $p^*$  and the subsidy, we can use (8.30) to solve for home export price  $p$ , obtaining the reaction curve  $p = r(p^*, s)$ . The analogous condition for the foreign exporter can be used to solve for foreign reaction curve  $p^* = r^*(p)$ . These are illustrated in Figure 8.10, with the typical properties that they are upward sloping and have a dampened response of each price to that of the competing good, so that  $\frac{dp}{dp^*} \frac{p^*}{p} = r_{p^*}(p^*, s) \frac{p^*}{p} < 1$ , and  $\frac{dp^*}{dp} \frac{p^*}{p^*} = r_p^*(p) \frac{p}{p^*} < 1$ . With a zero subsidy, the intersection of these determines the Bertrand equilibrium, at point B in Figure 8.10. The iso-profit curves of  $\pi$  have higher profits in the rightward direction (i.e. for higher  $p^*$ ), and similarly the iso-profit curve  $\pi^*$  have higher foreign profits in the upward direction (for higher  $p$ ), as illustrated.

Now consider how the application of an export subsidy shifts the home reaction curve. Totally differentiating (8.30), we obtain:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d p}}{\mathrm {d s}} = - \frac {\mathrm {x} _ {\mathrm {p}}}{\pi_ {\mathrm {p p}}} <   0, \tag {8.31}
$$

where the sign of (8.31) is obtained because  $x_p < 0$ , and  $\pi_{pp} < 0$  from the second-order condition for profit maximization. Thus, (8.31) shows that the export subsidy will unambiguously lower

Figure 8.11

the price charged by the home firm for its exports (given the foreign price). In Figure 8.11, the equilibrium is moved from point B to a point like D.

To see how this affects home welfare, we again subtract the cost of the subsidy from (8.29) to obtain home welfare,

$$
\mathrm {W} = (\mathrm {p} + \mathrm {s}) \mathrm {x} (\mathrm {p}, \mathrm {p} ^ {*}) - \mathrm {C} [ \mathrm {x} (\mathrm {p}, \mathrm {p} ^ {*}) ] - \mathrm {s x} (\mathrm {p}, \mathrm {p} ^ {*}) = \mathrm {p x} (\mathrm {p}, \mathrm {p} ^ {*}) - \mathrm {C} [ \mathrm {x} (\mathrm {p}, \mathrm {p} ^ {*}) ]. \tag {8.32}
$$

In (8.32), we once again obtain a measure of welfare that is identical to home profits in the absence of the export subsidy. This is shown by the is-profit curve labeled  $\pi$  in Figure 8.10 and W in Figure 8.11, and increases in the rightward direction, i.e. when the foreign price  $p^*$  increases. It is clear from Figure 8.11 that the export subsidy, by leading to a fall in prices, has reduced home welfare. The reason is that any increase in home profits – measured inclusive of the subsidy – is more than offset by the revenue cost of the subsidy, so that profits measured without the subsidy – which equals welfare – has declined.

In order for the home country to gain from and export policy, it must instead impose an export tax rather than a subsidy. This would have the effect of moving the equilibrium into the shaded region in Figure 8.11, and raising home welfare due to the increase in prices. These results are summarized with:

# Theorem (Brander and Spencer, 1985, Eaton and Grossman, 1986)

(a) Under Cournot duopoly, a subsidy to exports raises home welfare;
(b) Under Bertrand duopoly, a tax on exports raises home welfare.

Part (b) due to Eaton and Grossman (1986) shows that any "strategic" use of export subsidies is extremely sensitive to the form of competition. Since we do not expect the government to be

able to distinguish the market conduct, it becomes impossible to implement these policies in a welfare-improving manner. Furthermore, even if the government knew that a market was operating under Bertrand competition, the home firm would generally oppose this policy, and in practice export taxes are rarely used.[29]

Eaton and Grossman have extended this theorem to discuss other forms of market conduct, which we do not cover. Regardless of the form of competition, however, there are at least four other reasons why export subsidies should not be expected to generate a welfare improvement. First, as we found with a tariff, the possible gains for the home country can be dissipated by free entry into the industry, so that profits are reduced to zero. This was demonstrated by Horstmann and Markusen (1986).

Second, we have assumed above that the home exporter takes the subsidy as exogenous, i.e. the government sets the export subsidy in the first stage of the game, with the home and foreign firm competing in the second. But Carmichael (1987) argues that in the case of financing for export credits (such as provided by the U.S. Export-Import bank to purchasers of U.S. produced aircraft), these subsidies should instead be viewed as endogenous: the government essentially guarantees a low interest rate to the buyers of aircraft in the second stage of the game, with firms optimizing over price in the first stage. In that case, McCallum shows that even under Cournot competition the export subsidies no longer improve welfare. This result is similar in spirit to what we found in the previous chapter for anti-dumping duties, which fail to be welfare improving for the importing country when the foreign exporter treats them as endogenous.

Third, even if the above concerns do not apply, the foreign country could very well respond by applying subsidies of its own. In that way, the two exporters end up in a "subsidy war," which lowers welfare for both of them but raises welfare for the importing country. Of course, this concern also arises with tariffs, where a tariff applied by one country can invite retaliation by the foreign country and both countries can loose from this tariff war. This will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter.

Finally, it may well be the case that exporters differ in their productivities, which are not observable to the government. Brainard and Martimort (1997) have analyzed this in the context of Cournot competition between home and foreign exporters. With multiple home exporters, the home government needs to design a subsidy policy that induces them to truthfully reveal their productivities. It turns out that only the most efficient firms receive subsidies in this case, whereas the least efficient may very well be taxed.

Conversely, there are several reasons why export subsidies may be welfare improving regardless of the form of market conduct. Subsidies are often given to R&D rather than exports. Since R&D is a fixed cost which a firm must incur, these subsidies will influence the decision of a firm to enter the market or not. Dixit and Kyle (1985) investigate export subsidies in a model where these may deter entry by foreigners and encourage domestic entry, and find that they may be beneficial. Related to this, Maggi (1996) investigates subsidies to capacity rather than exports, in a model that is general enough to include both Bertrand and Cournot competition. He finds that these subsidies are weakly welfare improving, i.e. they will raise or leave unchanged welfare of the exporting country. Finally, export subsidies may be used in markets where learning is important, so that costs fall over time. This is the case in the manufacture of

semiconductors, for example, and also aircraft. $^{31}$  Then similar to the infant-industry argument for a tariff, subsidies may possibly be welfare improving.

# Subsidies to Commercial Aircraft

A favorite industry to study the impact of export subsidies is aircraft. In large passenger aircraft, there have been just three competitors: Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas in the U.S. and Airbus in Europe. The former two companies merged on August 1, 1997, so the industry effectively became a duopoly. Various types of subsidies have been used in both the U.S. and Europe to support their respective firms, so this is an ideal case to evaluate the theoretical results described above.

The idea that the two countries can be is a "subsidy war" appears to apply in this industry. Recognizing this, the U.S. and the Europe Community reached an agreement in 1992, which limited subsidies to  $33\%$  of development costs (see Tyson, 1992, and Pavcnik, 2002). In addition, the agreement prohibits production subsidies and limits the ability of government agencies to subsidize the interest rate on purchases of aircraft. Irwin and Pavcnik (2001) find that as a result of this accord, prices for commercial aircraft rose by something between  $3.1\%$  and  $8.8\%$ . They estimate that the reduction in subsidies granted is somewhat higher than this amount – between  $7.5\%$  and  $12.5\%$ .

There are recent claims that the terms of the 1992 agreement are being violated by a new aircraft under development by Airbus. As described by Irwin and Pavcnik (2001), commercial aircraft are comprised of two distinct product types: narrow-body aircraft with a single aisle, including the Boeing 737, 757 and Airbus A-320; and wide-body aircraft with two aisles,

including the Boeing 747, 777 and Airbus A-300. Airbus has now announced plans for the production of another wide-body aircraft, the A-380, which will be even larger than the Boeing 747 and will compete directly with the 747 in long flights. The expenditures to develop the A-380 are estimated to be \$12 billion, of which the governments of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Finland, and the U.K. are expected to cover up to one-third. This subsidy has led to a trade dispute between the U.S. and Europe over whether financing of the A-380 violates the 1992 agreement, as described in Pavcnik (2002).

The goal of Irwin and Pavcnik (2001) is to estimate demand and markups for wide-body aircraft, and then simulate the effect of A-380 entry on the market equilibrium. Airbus has stated that it needs to produce at least 250 planes to cover the development costs, but that it expects to sell 1,500 aircraft over the next 20 years. It has received initial orders for 60 planes (as of early 2001), but these appear to have received a discount of at least  $10\%$ , and perhaps as high as  $35\%$ , off the list price of \$235 million per plane. Boeing, on the other hand, states that market demand for such a super jumbo will not exceed 700 aircraft over the next 20 years. We can expect the estimation of market demand and prices, and the simulation of A-380 entry, to inform us as to which projection (700 planes or 1,500 planes) is more accurate.

Demand for a differentiated product depends on the quality-adjusted prices, which we wrote earlier as  $q_{i} = p_{i} / f(z_{i})$ . Suppose that we instead measure quality-adjusted prices  $q_{i}$  by the difference between nominal prices  $p_{i}$  and quality  $f(z_{i})$ . In addition, we assume that quality is a linear function of characteristics, so the quality-adjusted prices become  $q_{j} = \alpha p_{j} - \beta' z_{j} - \xi_{j}$ . In this notation,  $\xi_{j}$  reflects unmeasured characteristics of product  $j$ , which we treat as a random variable. Then the logit specification of demand is:

$$
s _ {i} = \frac {e ^ {- q _ {i}}}{\left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} e ^ {- q _ {j}} \right]} = \frac {e ^ {\beta^ {\prime} z _ {i} - \alpha p _ {i} + \xi_ {i}}}{\left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} e ^ {\beta^ {\prime} z _ {j} - \alpha p _ {j} + \xi_ {j}} \right]}, \tag {8.33}
$$

where  $s_i$  denotes the market share of product  $i$ , measured by quantity demanded of product  $i$  relative to total quantity of all products  $j = 1, \dots, N$ . As shown in Appendix B, the logit specification in (8.33) arises quite naturally from a discrete choice model, and can also be viewed as the demand from a representative consumer using McFadden's aggregation theorem.

To estimate the parameters of (8.33), we take logs and difference with an "outside" good indexed by 0, to obtain:

$$
\ln \mathrm {s} _ {\mathrm {i}} - \ln \mathrm {s} _ {0} = \beta^ {\prime} \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i}} - \alpha \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {i}} + \xi_ {\mathrm {i}}, \tag {8.34}
$$

where the quality-adjusted price  $\mathrm{q}_0$  of the "outside" good is normalized to zero. Thus, in (8.34) we regress the difference in market shares on the prices and characteristics of product i, to estimate the parameters  $(\alpha, \beta)$ . The approach can be contrasted with the hedonic regression in (8.17), where we are regressing prices on characteristics, while in (8.34) we are regressing market shares on characteristics and price. In both cases, we interpret  $\beta$  as the consumer valuation of characteristics. We can think of (8.34) as an alternative procedure to the hedonic regression, as proposed by Berry (1994).

Irwin and Pavcnik treat wide-body aircraft as differentiated into two market segments: those for medium-range and those for long-range trips. Denoting the products in each of these two groups by  $\mathrm{J_g}$ , for  $\mathrm{g} = 1,2$ , it is shown by Berry (see Appendix B) that the quantity-share of demand for each type of aircraft is re-written as:

$$
\ln s _ {i} - \ln s _ {0} = \beta^ {\prime} z _ {i} - \alpha p _ {i} + \rho \ln s _ {i | g} + \xi_ {i}, \quad i \in J _ {g}, \tag {8.35}
$$

where:  $s_i$  is the share of demand for wide-body aircraft i relative to all aircraft purchased annually;  $s_0$  is share of demand for narrow-body aircraft (treated as the "outside" good); and  $s_{\mathrm{ilg}}$  is the share of wide-body aircraft i within the medium range or long-range group  $g = 1,2$ . We expect that the parameter  $\rho$  is positive but less than unity, and Irwin and Pavcnik estimate  $\rho$  as 0.41 (standard error of 0.17) in their preferred specification.[32] This means that long-range wide-body aircraft are closer substitutes for each other than they are for medium-range aircraft. This means, for example, that the A-380 will compete more with the Boeing 747 than with the other medium-range aircraft sold by Airbus.

We can also use the demand equation (8.35) to obtain the optimal prices for multi-product firms. Irwin and Pavcnik consider both Bertrand and Cournot competition, but we focus here on the former case. Suppose that the total demand for aircraft (wide-body plus narrow-body) is given by  $H$  units per year. The demand for each model is then  $s_iH$ . If the firm in question sells products  $i = 1,\dots,M$ , then its profit maximization problem is:

$$
\max  _ {p _ {i}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} \left[ p _ {i} - g _ {i} \left(z _ {i}\right) \right] s _ {i} H, \tag {8.36}
$$

where  $\mathrm{g_i(z_i)}$  denotes marginal costs. Maximizing this over the choice of prices  $p_i$ , we obtain the first-order conditions,

$$
\mathrm {s} _ {\mathrm {i}} + \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \left[ \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {j}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {j}} \left(\mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {j}}\right) \right] \frac {\partial \mathrm {s} _ {\mathrm {j}}}{\partial \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {i}}} = 0, \quad \mathrm {i} = 1, \dots , \mathrm {M}. \tag {8.37}
$$

To simplify this expression, the derivatives of the market shares can be calculated from (8.35), and substituted into (8.37). In addition, we suppose that marginal costs are linear in characteristics, so  $g_{i}(z_{i}) = \gamma^{\prime}z_{i} + \omega_{i}$ , where  $\omega_{i}$  is a random error.

Irwin and Pavcnik (2001) estimate the demand parameters from (8.35), and substitute these into (8.37) in order to compute the markups. They find that these markups are high: current prices are about twice as high as marginal costs (under either Bertrand or Cournot competition), and even higher in past years. Having obtained estimates of demand and markups, they then simulate the effect of A-380 entry into the market. On the demand side, we know that this plane will be a close substitute for other long-range, wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 747. But on the pricing side, having multi-product firms means that Airbus will be less concerned than Boeing about the entry of this new product stealing demand away from its existing products. That is, Boeing will respond more aggressively than Airbus in lowering its own prices to prevent market share from falling (since Airbus is happy to have demand shifted towards its own new product). These predictions are borne out in the simulations. Relative to their previous sales, the percentage decline in demand is smaller for Boeing than for Airbus, because Boeing responds more aggressively in cutting its prices. Nevertheless, including the new sales of A-380, the overall market share of Airbus increases.

How many of the new A-380's will Airbus sell? This depends, of course, on the price charged. Irwin and Pavcnik experiment with discounts from the list price of  $0 - 30\%$ . With the largest discount, they calculate that Airbus will sell 34 planes annually, or 680 over 20 years, yielding \$110 billion in revenues. But annual sales of the A-380 are only one-half (one-quarter) as much when discounts of  $20\%$  ( $10\%$ ) are used instead, indicating that demand for the A-380 is

highly elastic. High markups in this market are sustained because firms are selling multiple products, but at the full list price for the A-380 its demand is extremely low – only 4 or 5 planes annually, which would not cover development costs. Lack of detailed cost data means that we cannot estimate the profit-maximizing price for the A-380, but it is evident that high discounts are needed to achieve significant sales. Even with the  $30\%$  discount, however, demand falls well below the market projection of 1,500 planes made by Airbus. Rather, sales at that discount are closer to the 700 planes expected by Boeing, whose company representatives state that demand at that level will not allow the project to be profitable.

# Conclusions

In the previous chapter, we identified three effects of a tariff on welfare: (i) a deadweight loss; (ii) a terms of trade effect; (iii) a reduction in the monopoly distortion if the output of home firms increase (without leading to inefficient entry). While we have not derived again the welfare criterion for an import quota, a similar decomposition would apply. However, any potential terms of trade gain becomes a loss if the importing country gives up the quota rents to the exporter, as under a VER. In that case, the only possible source of gain for the importing country would be under effect (iii), if the import quota led to a significant increase in home output and offset a monopoly distortion. But we have found that the reverse case is more likely to hold: with either a home monopoly or Bertrand duopoly, the quota (say, at the free trade level of imports) will lead to an increase in price and reduction in home quantity, so that the monopoly distortion is worsened rather than offset.

For export subsidies under perfect competition, the welfare criterion becomes: (i) a deadweight loss; (ii) a terms of trade effect. Whereas the terms of trade will improve due to a tariff for a large country, it will instead worsen due to the export subsidy in a two-good model.

We have noted, however, that with more goods there is the possibility that a subsidy on some goods will raise the terms of trade for others. The Ricardian model with a continuum of goods provides a good illustration of this, and allowed for welfare-improving export subsidies when they are targeted on a narrow range of goods. Determining whether this has occurred in any actual cases would be an interesting area for further research.

Under imperfect competition, the welfare criterion is simplified by considering sales to a third market. In that case the home firm earns profits from its export sales, and welfare is simply the difference between these and the revenue cost of the subsidy. This provides the clearest example of a potential role for "strategic" trade policy in shifting profits towards the home firm. As we have seen, however, subsidies may or may not be desirable: under Cournot competition export subsidies raise welfare, but under Bertrand competition they do not. Since it is very difficult to know the type of competition being used by firms, it becomes impossible for the government to implement this policy in a welfare-improving manner.

Empirically, the analysis of import quotas and export subsidies are linked because the industries involved are often producing discrete products, with multi-product firms. This chapter has served as an introduction to the empirical techniques that can be used on such industries, including hedonic regressions and the estimation of demand and prices as in Berry (1994). The reader is referred to Appendix B for more details on discrete choice methods, which should be useful for many trade policy issues.

# Problems

8.1 Suppose that the home and foreign firms are engaged in Cournot competition in the home market. Illustrate the free trade equilibrium, and answer:

a) Suppose that a VER is negotiated with the foreign firm, so that it agrees to not sell more than its free-trade quantity. What is the effect on the equilibrium?
b) Suppose that the VER is negotiated at below the free trade quantity. Show the effect on the equilibrium.

8.2 Suppose that the home firms and foreign firm are initially engaged in Bertrand competition in the home market, as discussed in the text. Suppose that the VER is negotiated at below the free trade quantity. Show the effect on the equilibrium and on profits.

8.3 Building on problem 5.3 in chapter 5, consider the CES utility function written as in (8.2),

$$
\mathrm {U} = \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \mathrm {a} _ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {c} _ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {\theta}, \quad \theta = (\sigma - 1) / \sigma ,
$$

where  $\mathrm{a_i = f(z_i)}^\theta$  is a transformation of the quality of each product, and can be treated as a parameter,  $i = 1,\dots ,N$ .

(a) Maximize this subject to the budget constraint,  $\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i c_i \leq I$ , to obtain an expression for the demands  $c_i$  as a function of prices and income.
(b) Use these expressions to show that  $\partial c_{i} / \partial p_{j} = \partial c_{j} / \partial p_{i}, i\neq j.$
(c) Also show that equation (8.9) holds, which we re-write as:

$$
- \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \frac {\partial \ln c _ {\mathrm {i}}}{\partial \ln p _ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) = \sigma + (1 - \sigma) \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {M}} \frac {p _ {\mathrm {j}} c _ {\mathrm {j}}}{\mathrm {I}}\right).
$$

8.4 Consider the problem of maximizing profits subject to the VER constraint in (8.11). Using the same steps as in (8.6) to (8.9), show that the solution for prices is as in equation (8.15).
8.5 Consider a Cournot duopoly exporting to a third market, and suppose that both countries apply export subsidies. Illustrate where this "subsidy war" can end up, i.e. illustrate the Nash equilibrium in subsidies for both governments.
