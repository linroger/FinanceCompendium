# Chapter 11: Multinationals and Organization of the Firm

Despite the fact that this book is about international trade, we have so far not introduced any role for traders. There has been little scope for firms, let alone economic organization more generally, to have any significant influence on trade patterns between countries. This contradicts the empirical fact that a good deal of trade occurs internally within firms located across countries. For the U.S., for example, about one-third of exports and over  $40\%$  of imports consist of intra-firm trade between a U.S. or foreign firm and their affiliates – see Table 11.1. When a firm operates in several countries it is a multinational enterprise, and the investment made in the foreign country is referred to as foreign direct investment (FDI). The first goal of this chapter is to introduce these features into our earlier trade models.

The classic treatment of a multinational is that it has some intangible asset (such as knowledge of a production process) that it can use to its advantage in a foreign market. It must decide whether to simply export there, or to invest in that market by building a plant and selling the product, or whether to engage in a joint venture or other contractual arrangement with a foreign firm to produce the good. We will initially focus on the first two decisions – whether to export to the foreign market or to build a plant and sell there. The third case – whether to engage in a joint venture with a foreign firm –will be discussed at the end of the chapter. Notice that this classic statement of the problem can equally well work in reverse, whereby the acquisition of a foreign firm can bring with it some knowledge of value to the purchaser, that could not be obtained by simply buying the products of that foreign firm.[2]

We see that the decision to engage in FDI by a multinational therefore involves three interrelated aspects – ownership of an asset, location to produce, and whether to keep the asset internal to the firm – and these comprise the so-called “OLI framework” of multinational activity (Dunning, 1977, 1981). In the following sections, we explore models giving insight into these various aspects. We begin with the simplest example where a firm considers shutting down its factory in one country and moving it to another, which can be modeled by a movement of physical capital across countries. While such a movement of capital does not necessarily occur with FDI (which may simply involve a change in ownership without any movement of physical capital), it is a useful place to begin our analysis.

After briefly reviewing capital inflows into a one-sector economy, we use the classic article by Mundell (1957) to investigate capital mobility in the two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model. In that case we find that even small tariffs have a very large impact on the movement of capital from one country to the other. This phenomenon of "tariff-jumping" FDI is a typical occurrence in import-substitution regimes, but is not restricted to the developing countries: many industrialized countries have used tariffs or quotas to induce the entry of foreign firms. This policy has some economic rationale, since the entry of foreign firms in simple models leads to a welfare gain due to increased domestic wages. The link between foreign investment and wages is therefore an important topic for empirical research. In Mundell's analysis, domestic wages are not affected by the foreign investment (due to "factor price insensitivity" in the HO model), but it is still the case that the deadweight loss of the tariff is reduced due to the entry of foreign firms.

Multinationals need not lead to capital flows between countries, however, and may instead just involve the ownership and location of firms. We consider several models of that

type, distinguishing vertical from horizontal multinationals. An example of the former case is a firm that has headquarters in one country but does production in another to obtain lower factor prices there (Helpman, 1984). The latter case occurs when a firm decides to duplicate production facilities and sell locally in two or more countries, due to tariffs or other barriers between them (Markusen, 1984, 2002). We identify conditions under which a particular type of multinational is most likely to arise in equilibrium, and once again, find that trade policies can have a significant impact on multinational location.

Beyond trade that is internal to multinational firms, there is another large portion of trade that occurs between firms that have some special relationship. An example is when a firm outsources some of its production process to a lower-wage country. In chapter 4 we modeled this as the purchase of intermediate inputs, but in fact, it often involves a longer-term relationship: the firm wanting to purchase the input is committing its money, and the selling firm is committing resources to production and development of the inputs. This relationship entails risk to both parties, and in many circumstances these risks cannot be offset by legal contracts. If the costs associated with these incomplete contracts are too great, then the firm wanting to purchase the inputs will instead vertically-integrate into this activity, becoming a vertical multinational. Thus, a consideration of transactions costs under incomplete contracts allows us to model the internalization decision of a multinational firm. The recent work of Grossman and Helpman (2002a,b) and others puts this in a general equilibrium setting, and investigates the implications of internalization for trade.

Transactions costs is the first and foremost reason for firms to integrate, but there are others. For example, joint ventures between firms in different countries can bring with them knowledge of the supplier and distribution networks in each country, and any other intangible

assets owned by either firm. Rauch and Trindade (2000) model this informational issue as a problem of "matching" firms across countries, where there is some inherent uncertainty in the ability to find a good partner. As we describe, the efficacy of achieving matches determines the extent to which markets are integrated, i.e. the extent to which factor price equalization obtains. The study of the organization of firms and its implications for international trade is a very new area of research, and is an appropriate topic on which to conclude our book.

# Capital Flows in a One-Sector Economy

We begin our analysis with the simplest case of a capital inflow into an economy producing just one good, as in MacDougall (1960). Suppose that the production function is given by  $y = f(L, K)$ , which is linearly homogeneous and concave. Normalizing the product price at unity, the rental on capital is  $r = f_K(L, K)$ , with  $f_{KK} < 0$ . Denote the domestic capital stock by  $K_0$  and the foreign inflow of capital by  $K^*$ . The equilibrium rental in the absence of the foreign capital is shown by  $r_0$  in Figure 11.1, and in the presence of the capital inflow by  $r_1$ . The foreign capital earns the amount  $r_1K^*$ , which is taken out of the country. The increase in GDP due to the capital inflow is,

$$
\Delta \mathrm {y} = \int_ {\mathrm {K} _ {0}} ^ {\mathrm {K} _ {0} + \mathrm {K} ^ {*}} \mathrm {f} _ {\mathrm {K}} \mathrm {d K} = \mathrm {A} + \mathrm {B}. \tag {11.1}
$$

Subtracting the payment to foreign capital,  $\mathrm{r_lK^* = B}$ , the net welfare gain to the home country is the area A. Thus, the inflow of foreign capital creates a welfare gain.

What is the source of this gain? It is evident from Figure 11.1 that as capital enters it depresses the rental, so that the payments to foreign capital (B) are less than the total area under

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/e92518f5-4cf8-4c58-a165-b17ce17987b7/cb3a77076c4e5256c02f1bf658d976e593a99a340df44dc20f3576d7735c55ef.jpg)
Figure 11.1

the demand curve  $(\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B})$ . The other side of this is that the capital inflow raises the marginal product of labor and wages  $\mathrm{w} = \mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{L}}(\mathrm{L}, \mathrm{K})$ . Indeed, the total increase in the wage bill equals the area  $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{C}$  in Figure 11.1.3 Area C is the redistribution of income from capital to labor, whereas area A is the net welfare gain and it accrues to labor.

These simple observations have led to a good deal of empirical work as to whether industries experiencing an inflow of foreign capital pay higher wages. For the U.S., Howenstein and Zeile (1994) and Doms and Jensen (1996) find that foreign plants pay higher wages than domestic plants. Blonigen and Tomlin (1999) further find that foreign plants typically grow faster than U.S. plants of similar size, and that they lead to a larger positive impact on local wages than does domestic investment. Combining U.S. data with information on Mexican and Venezuelan enterprises, Aitken et al (1996) also find a wage differential between domestic and foreign-owned enterprises, even after controlling for industry size and capital-intensity.

Notice that these studies are most often comparing the wages paid by foreign versus domestic plants, which is not exactly the same as the general equilibrium wage increase due to foreign investment predicted by Figure 11.1. For example, if foreign firms simply attract the highest-quality workers, this would lead to a wage increase over domestic plants, but not necessarily welfare gains. This same problem of self-selection occurs in empirical studies of technology transfer between foreign and local firms (through joint ventures or other spillovers across firms). Evidence in support of technology transfer for Mexico is found by Blomstrom (1986), Blomstrom and Persson (1983), and Kokko (1994), and for Indonesia by Blomstrom and Sjoholm (1999). These studies correlate industry productivity with the presence of foreign

firms. However, this leaves open the question of whether the higher productivity is due to the foreign plants themselves, or due to spillovers. This has been addressed using plant level data by Haddad and Harrison (1993) for Morocco, and Aitken and Harrison (1999) for Venezuela. They find that the foreign plants indeed have higher productivity, but that there is a weak negative correlation between their presence and productivity of the domestic plants in the same industry. Thus, these finding cast some doubt on the hypothesis of positive technological spillovers between foreign and domestic firms; rather, foreign firms are just more productive.

# Capital Flows in the Two-Sector Heckscher-Ohlin Model

We turn next to a famous example of capital flows in the two-sector HO model, due to Mundell (1957). Suppose there are two countries with identical technologies and homothetic tastes, initially engaged in free trade. With countries producing both goods and no factor intensity reversals, the rental on capital is uniquely determined by the goods prices, which we write as  $\mathrm{r(p_1,p_2)}$  for both countries. In Figure 11.2 the endowment of the two countries is shown at the point  $\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , which we assume is inside the factor price equalization set so the rental on capital is the same across countries. With free trade in goods, consumption of the two countries is proportional and occurs along the diagonal of Figure 11.2, such as the point  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$  (where  $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{i}}$  is the consumption vector of each country, and multiplying by the technology matrix A converts this to the factors embodied in consumption). In the case we have illustrated, country 1 is labor abundant, and the move from  $\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$  to  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$  involves country 1 importing the capital-intensive good. Assume that good 1 is capital intensive, so that  $\partial \mathrm{r}(\mathrm{p}_1,\mathrm{p}_2) / \partial \mathrm{p}_1 > 0$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/e92518f5-4cf8-4c58-a165-b17ce17987b7/52d3df824bb3cf3cefbecb2e279c618fc66139b1044770696e8773c2ed25144a.jpg)
Figure 11.2

Now allow for capital mobility between the countries, and suppose that country 1 applies a specific import tariff of  $t > 0$ . This raises the domestic price of good 1 in that country, and since this good is capital-intensive, by the Stolper-Samuelson theorem it increases the return to capital,  $r(p_1 + t, p_2) > r(p_1, p_2)$ . It follows that capital will flow from country 2 to country 1. In Figure 11.2, this shifts the effective endowment point vertically upwards from point  $V^i$ . The question is, where will this process end? The new equilibrium allowing for capital mobility requires that the return to capital be equalized across the countries. But with the tariff driving a wedge between the prices in the two countries, it is impossible for rentals to be equalized:  $t > 0$  always implies that  $r(p_1 + t, p_2) > r(p_1, p_2)$ . Obviously, something in this equation must change to achieve a new long-run equilibrium!

To see what changes, let us think about what happens as the endowments of the countries move upwards from point  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$ . Capital is flowing towards country 1, which increases the output of industry 1 and reduces that of industry 2. Since good 1 is imported, the increased supply of that good lowers imports, and the reduced supply of good 2 also lowers exports. So as we move upwards from point  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , trade between the countries is being reduced. This will continue until the endowments reach the diagonal, indicated by the point  $\overline{\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , at which point the capital/labor ratios in the two countries are identical. This means that there is no reason for trade: both economies are in autarky.

What about the rental on capital in each country? Since both countries are in autarky, with identical capital/labor ratios and identical homothetic tastes, this means that the equilibrium prices are the same across countries. It follows therefore, that the equilibrium rental on capital is also the same across countries. The tariff that is being applied by country 1 is redundant: since

there are no imports, the tariff no longer drives a wedge between the prices and rentals. So we conclude that the point  $\overline{\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  is the new equilibrium with capital mobility. Product prices and the rental on capital are unchanged from their original values before the tariff (since this is a property of a change in endowments within the FPE cone). Furthermore, the entire increase in the GDP of country 1 from point  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$  to point  $\overline{\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  is repaid to the foreign capital located there. $^5$  Deducting this amount from GDP, country 1 ends up back at its original consumption point  $\mathbf{AD}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , so its welfare is the same as before the tariff was applied!

This analysis by Mundell (1957) is important for several reasons: it shows that a tariff can lead to a large enough inflow of capital to eliminate trade; and it shows that the capital flow eliminates the deadweight loss due to the tariff. Both of these observations are realistic, and can be illustrated by the VER applied to Japanese exports of automobiles into the U.S., as discussed in chapter 8. While this trade policy took the form of a quota rather than a tariff, it still led a large inflow of Japanese auto firms into the U.S. – enough to make the VER redundant after 1987 (i.e. there were fewer imports from Japan than allowed by the VER). This means that its welfare cost was also reduced.

This results of Mundell (1957) are sometimes summed up with the phrase "trade in factors is a substitute for trade in goods," since the capital inflow due to the tariff has the effect of eliminating trade. This hypothesis has been empirically tested. Blonigen (2002) investigates the extent to which FDI and imports are substitutes (which inflows of capital reducing imports) or complements (FDI leading to higher imports). He finds evidence for both hypotheses, as is

also confirmed by Swenson (2002) for the U.S. and Goldberg and Klein (2000) using data from Latin America. The effect of U.S. anti-dumping duties on inward FDI is investigated by Blonigen (2000). He finds that this U.S. investment is a realistic option only for firms with prior multinational experience. While the raw data show a particularly high response rate for Japanese firms shifting their production to the U.S., this is mainly explained by the fact that many of these firms are already multinationals.

# Vertical and Horizontal Multinationals

We turn now from a discussion of capital flows to the modeling of multinational activity, where a firm chooses to operate plants in multiple countries. We distinguish the cases where the multinational chooses to operate its headquarters in one country and its production facilities in another – the so-called vertical multinational – from the case where it operates its headquarters in one country but has production facilities in multiple countries – the horizontal multinational.

# Vertical Multinationals

The vertical case was first analyzed by Helpman (1984c) in a two-factor framework with monopolistic competition. The incentive to operate headquarters in one country and production in another arises due to factor price differences across the countries. As we shall see, however, the ability of a multinational to spread its facilities across several countries serves to ameliorate these factor price differences, and enlarges the region of factor price equalization.

Suppose that sector 1 produces a homogeneous good, while sector 2 produces a differentiated good with a CES utility function. A variety of the differentiated good requires  $\alpha$  units skilled labor H in its fixed costs (which we think of as "headquarters" services), and  $\beta$  units of unskilled labor L in its variable costs. Denoting the output of a differentiated variety by  $y_{2i}$

the costs of production are  $C_{2i}(w, q, y_i) = q\alpha + w\beta y_{2i}$ , where  $q$  and  $w$  are the wages of skilled and unskilled labor, respectively. As discussed in chapter 5, with a CES utility function there is a unique output  $y_{2i} = \overline{y}$  at which profits are zero, where free entry also determines the number of varieties  $N_2$  in sector 2. Then the demand for skilled labor for each variety produced is  $\alpha$ , and the demand for unskilled labor is  $\beta \overline{y}$ .

Technologies are the same across countries, and we will focus on the "integrated world equilibrium" at which factor price equalization (FPE) is obtained. In sector 1, producing the homogeneous good, the requirements of unskilled and skilled labor to produce one unit of output are denoted by  $a_{1L}$  and  $a_{1H}$ . In sector 2, the requirements to produce one variety of the

differentiated product are  $\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{L}} \equiv \beta \overline{\mathrm{y}}$  and  $\mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{H}} \equiv \alpha$ . Then we can let  $\mathrm{A} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{L}} & \mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{L}} \\ \mathrm{a}_{1\mathrm{H}} & \mathrm{a}_{2\mathrm{H}} \end{bmatrix}$  denote the matrix of labor requirements in each industry, which applies in either country under FPE. Let  $\mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}} = (\mathrm{y}_1^{\mathrm{j}}, \mathrm{N}_2^{\mathrm{j}})'$  denote the vector whose first component is the output of industry 1 in country j, and whose second component is the number of varieties of the differentiated product in sector 2 produced in country j. Then full-employment of resources in each country requires that  $\mathrm{AY}^{\mathrm{j}} = \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{j}}$ , where  $\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{j}}$  is the vector of endowments in country j,  $\mathrm{j} = 1,2$ .

Let us assume initially that the fixed costs of  $\alpha$  and variable costs of  $\beta \overline{y}$  for each differentiated good have to be performed in the same country. Then the integrated world equilibrium can be illustrated in a fashion very much analogous to the two-factor HO model. In Figure 11.3, the FPE set is shown by the parallelogram  $0^{1} Q 0^{2} Q' 0^{1}$ . Starting at any endowment point such as  $V^{j}$  within this parallelogram, free trade in goods allows the economies to consume

Figure 11.3

at points  $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{j}}$  that are proportional across countries, so that the factors embodied in consumption  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{j}}$  lie along the diagonal of the box. The slope of the line between  $\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{j}}$  and  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{j}}$  (in absolute value) is the equilibrium ratio of factor prices  $\mathrm{w/q}$ .

Let us assume that industry 1, producing the homogeneous product, is unskilled-labor intensive, so that  $\mathrm{a_{1L} / a_{1H} > a_{2L} / a_{2H} = \beta \overline{y} / \alpha}$ . Then from the endowment and consumption points we can readily compute the trade balance in each industry. Thus, from the endowment point  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{j}}$ , country 1 uses the amount of unskilled labor  $0^{1}\mathrm{B}$  in industry 1, and  $0^{1}\mathrm{B}'$  in industry 2. Similarly, from the consumption point  $\mathrm{AD}^{\mathrm{j}}$ , country 1 uses the amount of unskilled labor  $0^{1}\mathrm{C}$  in industry 1, and  $0^{1}\mathrm{C}'$  in industry 2. It follows that country 1 is an importer of good 1 (OB < OC), and a net exporter of the differentiated good  $(\mathrm{OB}' > \mathrm{OC}')$ . In addition, there is intra-industry trade in the differentiated goods sector.

Now let us change our assumptions and suppose that the fixed costs of  $\alpha$  skilled labor and variable costs of  $\beta \overline{y}$  unskilled labor for each differentiated good can be performed in different countries by a multinational firm. Then how does the ability to "fragment" the headquarters and production activities across countries affect the FPE set? A quick (and entirely correct) answer can be obtained by appealing to the FPE set with multiple goods developed by Dixit and Norman (1980), as discussed in chapter 3. Rank the activities beginning with the variable costs of producing the differentiated good, which uses only unskilled labor; followed by the production of the homogeneous product which uses both factors; followed by the fixed costs

Figure 11.4

of producing the differentiated good, which uses only skilled labor. This gives three rather than two factor requirements vectors, which are  $(\beta \overline{y},0)$ ,  $(a_{1L},a_{1H})$ , and  $(0,\alpha)$ . Multiplying each of these by the total worldwide amount of each activity in the integrated equilibrium, and summing them, we will obtain the FPE set  $0^{1}\mathrm{RS0}^{2}\mathrm{R}^{\prime}\mathrm{S}^{\prime}0^{1}$  in Figure 11.4. This FPE region is clearly larger than the original parallelogram  $0^{1}\mathrm{Q0}^{2}\mathrm{Q}^{\prime}0^{1}$ .

To understand how FPE is achieved in this expanded set, suppose that the factor endowments of the two countries are given by  $\mathbf{V}'$  in Figure 11.4. This point lies outside the original FPE set, so that any firm in sector 1 would choose the country with lowest wage of skilled labor for headquarters, and the country with lowest wage of unskilled labor for production. Since country 1 is skilled-labor abundant, we can presume that it would have the lower relative wage of skilled labor, and firms from either country would want to establish headquarters there. This will increase the demand for skilled labor in country 1, to the point where the entire endowment  $\mathbf{V}'$  can be employed at the same factor prices as prevailing abroad. Intuitively, this is what allows FPE to hold in the expanded set.

Because there are three production activities and only two factors, there are actually many combinations of the activities across countries that are consistent with full-employment and FPE. As in Helpman (1984c), we will focus on those combinations that lead to a minimum amount of trade. With factor endowments given by  $\mathrm{V}'$  in Figure 11.4, country 1 could produce varieties of the differentiated good using resources shown by  $0^1\mathrm{C}'$ , and then devote its remaining endowment of skilled labor, shown by  $\mathrm{C}'\mathrm{V}'$ , to headquarters services. These headquarters services would be combined with unskilled labor in country 2, of the amount  $\mathrm{V}'\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{m}}$ , in order to produce varieties of the differentiated product in that country. Additional resources in country 2,

of the amount  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{m}}\mathbf{Q}^{\prime}$ , would also be devoted to produce varieties of the differentiated product, and the remaining resource of  $\mathrm{Q}'0^{2}$  would be used to produce the homogeneous product in sector 1. Factor price equalization is achieved through combining skilled labor for headquarters services in country 1 with unskilled labor for production in country 2.

What is the trade pattern implied by the multinational activity? For factor endowments in the region  $0^{1}\mathrm{S}^{\prime}\mathrm{Q}^{\prime}$ , as we have been discussing, the homogeneous good is produced only in country 2, so country 1 imports that good. But for the differentiated good, the trade pattern is not so clear. Indeed, in the case we have illustrated in Figure 11.4, it turns out that both countries have balanced net trade in the differentiated good. This can be seen by comparing the resources used in production and consumption. As discussed just above, country 1 uses the resources  $0^{1}\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$  to produce varieties of the differentiated good. To determine its consumption, we can trace a line from its endowment point  $\mathrm{V}^{\prime}$  to its consumption of factors AD' (this line has the slope w/q). We then decompose the point AD' into the consumption of factors  $0^{1}\mathrm{C}$  in sector 1, and  $0^{1}\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$  in sector 2. Notice that for the case we have illustrated, the consumption of factors  $0^{1}\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$  in sector 2 is identical to those used in the production of differentiated varieties by country 1. It follows that trade is balanced in that sector, and the same will hold for country 2: they have balanced intra-industry trade in the differentiated good. $^{8}$

How can country 1 be an importer of the homogeneous good, and yet have balanced net trade in the differentiated good? The answer is that this country receives profits from its

multinationals engaged in production abroad, which would show up as investment income in the current account. Thus, its balance of trade deficit (due to importing the homogeneous good) is offset by receipts from its subsidiaries abroad, so that it has an overall current account balance. The amount of profits earned in country 2 will be proportional to the unskilled labor employed there by the multinationals, which is measured by  $\mathrm{L}^{*} \equiv \mathrm{V}'\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{m}}$ . With  $\beta \overline{\mathbf{y}}$  units of unskilled labor needed per variety, the number of varieties produced by multinationals in country 2 is therefore  $\mathrm{N}^{*} \equiv \mathrm{L}^{*} / \beta \overline{\mathbf{y}}$ . The value of headquarters services provided by these multinationals through employing skilled labor in country 1 is then  $\alpha \mathrm{N}^{*} = \alpha \mathrm{L}^{*} / \beta \overline{\mathbf{y}}$ . This is an "invisible export" by country 1, which is used to pay for its imports of the homogeneous good.

As we move to other regions of the FPE set, the trade patterns change. For example, consider endowment within  $0^{2}\mathrm{R}^{\prime}\mathrm{S}^{\prime}\mathrm{Q}^{\prime}$ , such as  $\mathbf{V}^{\prime \prime}$ . Once again, multinationals with headquarters in country 1 will use some of the unskilled labor in country 2 so that FPE is achieved. In this case, the amount of unskilled labor employed in country 2 by multinationals is the distance  $\mathrm{V}^{\prime \prime}\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{n}}$ . We can think of the vector  $0^{1}\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{n}}$  as the employment of resources by firms that have headquarters in country 1, as distinct from that country's endowment vector  $0^{1}\mathrm{V}^{\prime \prime}$ . In the absence of multinationals, the employment of resources must equal a country's endowment, but now they can differ. We can also construct the trade patterns in the region  $0^{2}\mathrm{R}^{\prime}\mathrm{S}^{\prime}\mathrm{Q}^{\prime}$ . It turns out the country 1 can be either an importer or an exporter of the homogeneous product in this region, and also exports the differentiated product as well as headquarters services. $^{10}$

Setting aside the details of the trade patterns, the most important message to take from Figure 11.4 is that vertical multinationals enlarge the FPE set. This is a deep insight from Helpman (1984c), and can be compared to our results in chapter 4, where we discussed trade in intermediate inputs and wages. We suggested there that the ability to fragment the production process, and purchase some unskilled-labor intermediate inputs from another country, could lead to an increase in the relative demand and wages of skilled labor in both countries. In comparison, we have argued above that such outsourcing by multinationals will lead to an enlargement of the FPE set, and therefore, a tendency for factor prices to equalize across countries. These two results are not necessarily inconsistent, but it is worth thinking about how the assumptions of Helpman (1984c) differ from those in chapter 4.

In the model of chapter 4 with a continuum of inputs, we showed that an increase in outsourcing would occur through the "borderline" activity being transferred from the home to the foreign country: that activity was less skill-intensive than any other activity performed at home, but more skill-intensive than any other activity performed abroad. Therefore, the relative demand for skilled labor rose in both countries, as did its relative wage. In contrast, in our discussion of Helpman's (1984) model above, we treated the production of the differentiated good as using only unskilled labor, with headquarters services using only skilled labor. The production activity is therefore less skill-intensive than the homogeneous good produced in either country. The transfer of multinational production from country 1 to country 2 raises the relative demand for skilled labor in country 1, but lowers it in country 2. This will raise the relative wages of skilled labor in country 1, but lower it in country 2, thereby moving these relative wages towards equality, so that FPE is achieved.

We see that the assumptions on factor-intensities differ between chapter 4 and what we have used to describe Helpman's (1984) model. Obviously, other assumptions on factor-intensities can be incorporated into Helpman's model, as well as alternative assumptions on fixed costs and trade barriers, as we shall explore in the next section.

# Horizontal Multinationals

In Helpman's model, the multinational will never choose to operate production facilities in both countries, because with free trade, there is no benefit to doing so. But suppose that there are some trade barriers, such as the "iceberg" transport costs discussed in chapter 5. Suppose further that each plant has some specific fixed costs, which must be borne in the same country as production costs. Then we will say that horizontal FDI occurs if a firm chooses to operate production facilities in multiple countries, with each plant selling locally to that market. Horizontal FDI requires that the gains from selling locally and thereby avoiding transport costs more than offset the plant-specific fixed costs. This case has been analyzed in a series of papers beginning with Markusen (1984) and culminating in the book by Markusen (2002). These writings cover a whole range of vertical and horizontal multinationals, using unskilled and skilled labor in varying proportions. We will not attempt to summarize all these results, but shall develop one example of how horizontal multinationals can arise.

We suppose that a firm in country  $i$  is already producing for its home market, and is deciding whether to export to county  $j$  or establish a production facility and sell there. This firm has already covered its fixed costs of headquarters services, as well as any plant-specific fixed

costs in country i, and there is an additional fixed cost of establishing a plant abroad. We suppose there are "iceberg" transportation costs between the countries, so that  $\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}} > 1$  units of the good must be exported from country i in order for one unit to arrive in j. We let  $\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{i}}$  denote the f.o.b. price received by the firm in country i. Inclusive of the transportation costs, the c.i.f. price abroad is  $\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{ij}} = \mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{ij}}\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{i}}$ .

We borrow the demand structure from our treatment of monopolistic competition in chapter 5. With country  $j$  having a CES utility function over the differentiated product, its demand  $c^{ij}$  for a variety sent from country  $i$  is:

$$
\mathrm {c} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} = \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} / \mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {- \sigma} \left(\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} / \mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right), \tag {11.2}
$$

$\mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}}$  is country j's GDP and  $\mathbf{P}^{\mathrm{j}}$  refers to country j's overall price index, defined as:

$$
\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}} = \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {C}} \mathrm {N} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma}\right) ^ {1 / (1 - \sigma)}, \tag {11.3}
$$

where  $\mathbf{N}^{\mathrm{i}}$  is the number of products exported by each country  $i = 1,\dots ,C$

We treat labor as the only factor of production, and do not distinguish by skill type. The exporting firm in country  $i$  has the production function  $L^i = \beta y^i$ , where  $\beta$  is its marginal labor costs. Note that its plant-specific fixed costs are already covered by virtue of its home sales of this product. Revenue received from producing in country  $i$  and exporting is  $p^{ij}c^{ij} = p^i y^i$ , where output is related to consumption by  $y^i = c^{ij}T^{ij}$ . The profits from exporting are then:

$$
\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \beta \mathrm {y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} = \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \beta\right) \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} \mathrm {c} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}. \tag {11.4}
$$

Substituting for the CES demand from (11.3), and maximizing (11.4) over the choice of the price  $p^{ij} = T^{ij}p^i$ , we readily obtain the optimal price  $p^i [1 - (1 / \sigma)] = \beta w^i$ . Substituting this back into (11.4), we obtain the maximized value of profits:

$$
p ^ {i} y ^ {i} - w ^ {i} \beta y ^ {i} = \left(\frac {p ^ {i} y ^ {i}}{\sigma}\right) = \left(\frac {p ^ {i} T ^ {i j}}{\sigma}\right) \left(\frac {p ^ {i} T ^ {i j}}{P ^ {j}}\right) ^ {- \sigma} \left(\frac {Y ^ {j}}{P ^ {j}}\right) = \frac {1}{\sigma} \left(\frac {p ^ {i} T ^ {i j}}{P ^ {j}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} Y ^ {j}, \tag {11.5}
$$

where the second equality follows using consumption from (11.2) with  $y^i = c^{ij} T^{ij}$ , and the third by simplification. From (11.5), we see that higher transport costs reduce profits from exporting, while higher GDP abroad increase profits.

Rather than exporting from country i, the multinational firm can instead establish a production facility in country j, and sell locally. In that case, it will face the production function  $\mathrm{L}^{\mathrm{j}} = \alpha^{\mathrm{j}} + \beta \mathrm{y}^{\mathrm{j}}$ , including the plant-specific fixed costs paid abroad. For simplicity we treat marginal labor costs  $\beta$  as equal across countries, though the wages and fixed costs can differ. There are no transport costs when producing in country j and selling locally, so with the price  $\mathfrak{p}^{\mathrm{j}}$ , the quantity sold is,

$$
\mathrm {c} ^ {\mathrm {j}} = \left(\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {j}} / \mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {- \sigma} \left(\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} / \mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right). \tag {11.2'}
$$

Again, the optimal price is determined as  $p^j [1 - (1 / \sigma)] = \beta w^j$ . Using this and (11.2') to compute profits earned from the subsidiary in country  $j$ , we obtain:

$$
p ^ {j} y ^ {j} - w ^ {j} \left(\beta y ^ {j} - \alpha^ {j}\right) = \frac {1}{\sigma} \left(\frac {p ^ {j}}{P ^ {j}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \left(\frac {Y ^ {j}}{P ^ {j}}\right) - w ^ {j} \alpha^ {j}. \tag {11.5'}
$$

Thus, in order for the multinational based in country i to wish to establish a second plant in country j, it must be the case that (11.5') is at least as large as (11.5):

$$
\frac {1}{\sigma} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} - \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {j}} \geq \frac {1}{\sigma} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}. \tag {11.6}
$$

Conversely, in order to be a horizontal multinational, it must be the case that it is not profitable to shut down its plant in country i and simply export from the single plant in country j. The condition to ensure that is:

$$
\frac {1}{\sigma} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {i}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {i}} \geq \frac {1}{\sigma} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {j i}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {i}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}}, \tag {11.6'}
$$

where  $\alpha^i$  is its fixed costs in country  $i$ . The left-hand side of (11.6') is the profits from operating its plant in country  $i$ , while the right-hand side is the profits from exporting from country  $j$  to  $i$ .

So in order to have a horizontal multinational operating plants in both countries, both (11.6) and (11.6') must hold. These conditions can be re-expressed by moving the fixed costs to the right-side, multiplying each equation by  $\sigma$  and multiplying them together, in which case we obtain a single necessary condition to ensure that the multinational maintains plants in both countries:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left[ 1 - \left(\mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {j i}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \right] \left(\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \\ \geq \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} + \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {j}} \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {j i}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {i}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} + \sigma^ {2} \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {j}}. \tag {11.7} \\ \end{array}
$$

This condition is more likely to hold in the following regions of parameters:

# Theorem (Markusen and Venables, 1998, 2000; Markusen, 2002)

Horizontal multinationals will be more likely when: (a) transport costs are higher; (b) plant-specific fixed costs are lower; (c) GDP's are higher or more similar across countries.

Conditions (a) and (b) of this theorem follow by inspection of condition (11.7).

Condition (c) require some additional explanation. Notice that product of GDP's can be rewritten as:

$$
\mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}} = \left(\mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {2} \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {j}} = \left(\mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathbf {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {2} [ 1 - (\mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {i}}) ^ {2} - (\mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {2} ] / 2, \tag {11.8}
$$

where  $s^i = Y^i / (Y^i + Y^j)$  and  $s^j = Y^j / (Y^i + Y^j)$  are county  $i$  and  $j$ 's shares of GDP, with  $(s^i + s^j) = 1$ . It follows that  $1 = (s^i + s^j)^2 = (s^i)^2 + (s^j)^2 + 2s^i s^j$ , from which the last equality in (11.8) is

obtained. In chapter 5, we referred to  $[1 - (\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{i}})^{2} - (\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{j}})^{2}]$  as a "size dispersion index" of the two countries, and it takes its highest value (of one-half) when the countries are the same size.

Denoting this index by  $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{ij}}$ , we can divide (11.8) by  $(\mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{i}} + \mathrm{Y}^{\mathrm{j}})$  and rewrite it as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left[ 1 - \left(\mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}} \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {j i}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \right] \left(\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) \left(\frac {\mathrm {D} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{2}\right) \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} \\ \geq \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} + \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {j}} \mathrm {s} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {p} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \mathrm {T} ^ {\mathrm {j i}}}{\mathrm {P} ^ {\mathrm {i}}}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} + \frac {\sigma^ {2} \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {i}} \mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {j}} \alpha^ {\mathrm {j}}}{\left(\mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathrm {Y} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right)}. \tag {11.7'} \\ \end{array}
$$

We see that the left of (11.7') is larger when the sum of GDP's  $(\Upsilon^{\mathrm{i}} + \Upsilon^{\mathrm{j}})$  is larger, and the right is smaller. In addition, the left is larger when the size dispersion index is higher, meaning that the countries are of similar size.[13] Under these conditions, (11.7') is more likely to hold.

Markusen and Venables (1998) and Markusen (2002, chap. 5) demonstrate the above theorem in a model where firms produce a homogeneous good under Cournot-Nash competition, while Markusen and Venables (2000) and Markusen (2002, chap. 6) use monopolistic competition with a CES utility function. In both cases, the multinationals employ high and low-skilled labor. So in addition to the similarity of GDP's that we obtain in condition (c), they also find that horizontal multinationals are more likely to hold when the relative endowments of high and low-skilled workers are similar. Notice that this is the opposite of the result obtained from Helpman's (1984c) model: since vertical multinationals occur in the regions  $0^{1}\mathrm{S}^{\prime}\mathrm{Q}^{\prime}$  and  $0^{2}\mathrm{R}^{\prime}\mathrm{S}^{\prime}$ $Q^{\prime}$  of Figure 11.4, this requires that the relative endowments of skilled/unskilled workers are sufficiently different.

# Estimating the Knowledge-Capital Model

The vertical and horizontal multinationals can be combined in a unified framework, which Markusen (2002, chaps. 7, 8) refers to as the "knowledge-capital" model. This term is used because the knowledge created at the headquarters is utilized at plants in multiple countries: it has the nature of a public good within the firm. This is the intangible asset that we identified in the introduction of the chapter as essential to any multinational firm. It is assumed that the ratio of skilled/unskilled labor used in headquarters services exceeds that used in plant

production by multinationals, which in turn exceeds that used in production of the homogeneous competitive good. Then Markusen (2002, chap. 8) finds that increased investment by multinationals raises the relative wage of skilled/unskilled workers in the skill-abundant country, and possibly in the other country as well. The reason for this is that the skill-abundant country specializes more in headquarters services, while the other country specializes more in production by multinationals, which raise the relative demand for skilled labor in both countries. This outcome applies to either horizontal or vertical investment, and is very similar to what we obtained from outsourcing in chapter 4. $^{14}$

The knowledge-capital model has been estimated by Carr, Markusen and Maskus (2001), and hypothesis tests to distinguish the horizontal versus vertical model are performed by Markusen and Maskus (1999, 2002) as well as Blonigen, Davies and Head (2002). These papers differ somewhat in their precise specifications, and we will combine their various results in our discussion below. The dependent variable used is the real sales of foreign affiliates of multinational firms, including both their local and export sales. For horizontal multinationals the local sales are most important, while for vertical multinational the export sales (back to the parent corporation) are most important.

The equation estimated by Carr, Markusen and Maskus (2001) is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {R e a l A f f i l i a t e S a l e s} = \beta_ {0} + \beta_ {1} \left(\mathrm {G D P} ^ {\mathrm {i}} + \mathrm {G D P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) + \beta_ {2} \left(\mathrm {G D P} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {G D P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {2} + \beta_ {3} \left(\text {S k i l l} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \text {S k i l l} ^ {\mathrm {j}}\right) \\ + \beta_ {4} (\mathrm {G D P} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {G D P} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) (\mathrm {S k i l l} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {S k i l l} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) + \beta_ {5} (\alpha^ {\mathrm {j}}) + \beta_ {6} (\tau^ {\mathrm {j}}) + \beta_ {7} (\tau^ {\mathrm {j}}) (\mathrm {S k i l l} ^ {\mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {S k i l l} ^ {\mathrm {j}}) ^ {2} \\ + \beta_ {8} \left(\tau^ {\mathrm {i}}\right) + \beta_ {9} \text {D i s t a n c e} ^ {\mathrm {i j}}, \tag {11.9} \\ \end{array}
$$

where country  $i$  refers to the headquarters of a multinational and country  $j$  to the location of its a foreign affiliate. The first variable on the right of (11.9) is the sum of country GDP's, which we expect to be positively related to the presence of horizontal multinationals, and therefore real affiliate sales ( $\beta_{1} > 0$ ). Likewise, the second variable is the squared difference in real GDP's, which measures the size dispersion, and which we expect to be negatively related to horizontal multinationals ( $\beta_{2} < 0$ ).

What about for vertical multinationals? In the model of Helpman (1984c), neither the sum nor the difference of GDP's determines the magnitude of affiliate exports back to the parent country; rather, it is the relative factor endowments that determines the magnitude of these exports. For example, in Figure 11.4, the affiliate exports are proportional to the line segments  $\mathrm{V}^{\prime}\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{n}}$  and  $\mathrm{V}''\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{n}}$ , which equal the amount of unskilled labor used for affiliate production. The position of the endowment points  $\mathrm{V}'$  and  $\mathrm{V}''$  relative to the original FPE set is what determines these exports, not the country GDP's.

Thus, one test of the horizontal versus the vertical model is to compare the expected coefficients  $\beta_{1} > 0$  and  $\beta_{2} < 0$  for the horizontal case, with  $\beta_{1} = \beta_{2} = 0$  for the vertical case. The estimation of (11.9) is performed with a dataset on inbound and outbound U.S. foreign direct investment, from 1986 - 1994. For each country pair, either i or j denotes the United States, with the other index being the location of either a U.S. affiliate, or a foreign parent company with an

affiliate in the U.S.. The hypotheses that  $\beta_{1} > 0$  and  $\beta_{2} < 0$  are strongly confirmed in the estimation, which supports the horizontal over the vertical multinational model.

The next two variables in (11.9) are related to the skill differences between the parent and host country, where  $\mathrm{Skill}^i$  is measured by the share of the labor force in certain skilled occupations. In the horizontal model, it is expected that investment and affiliate sales are declining in the endowment differences of the countries, and this effect is more pronounced when the country GDP's also differ. Thus, the hypotheses  $\beta_3 < 0$  and  $\beta_4 < 0$  are obtained from the horizontal model. In contrast, with Helpman's model vertical investment is higher when the endowments of the countries differ more, so that  $\beta_3 > 0$  is predicted. Markusen (2002, chap. 12) also finds in his simulations that countries that are both small and skilled-labor abundant relative to their trading partners, such as the Netherlands, have the greatest concentration of headquarters for vertical multinationals. Thus, the interaction between relative country size and the skill endowment is positively related to vertical investment, so that  $\beta_4 > 0$  also.

In the estimation of (11.9), the sign pattern  $\beta_{3} < 0$  and  $\beta_{4} < 0$  is strongly confirmed, so once again, the horizontal model is accepted and the vertical model is rejected. This outcome is perhaps not surprising in view of the fact that the majority of foreign investments worldwide are between industrial countries, and not between developed and developing countries (Markusen, 1995, and Lipsey, 1999, 2001). These investments would be more typical of horizontal rather than vertical linkages. This tendency can be seen from the data on the stocks and flows of global FDI over 1980-95, as shown in Tables 11.2 and 11.3.

Looking first at the inward stock of FDI in the upper-half of Table 11.2, the proportion of FDI located in developing countries fluctuated between  $19\%$  and  $26\%$  over 1980-95, so the

majority of FDI is in developed countries. There was a surge of investment into the developed countries during the second half of the 1980s, during which time the stock of investment in developed countries nearly tripled from  \$538 billion to\$ 1,373 billion. At the same time, there was a considerable increase in foreign investment into the U.S., which doubled from 1980 to 1985 and again from 1985 to 1990. Since 1990, the stock of investment located in the developing countries has grown more rapidly, which is in large part due to increased FDI into China. This country accounts for  $18.6\%$  of the inward stock of developing countries in 1995, up from  $4.1\%$  just five years earlier. The vast majority of FDI entering into developed and developing countries alike comes from the developed countries, as shown in the lower-half of Table 11.2.

Similar to these stock figures, the majority of FDI flows shown in Table 11.3 are to developed countries, though China is also a large recipient. For example, in 1995 the United States received the most FDI, with an inflow of  \$60.2 billion, but China has the second-largest inflow of\$ 37.5 billion. The surge in FDI flows during the second half of the 1980s both comes from and was directed towards the developed countries: this flow reached \$172 billion in 1989. This was followed by a fall in direct investment magnitudes from 1990 to 1991, with a recovery that was slow at first but has increased recently to reach \$203 billion in 1995. The inflow of investment into China grew most dramatically in 1990-92, and again in 1994-95.

From this very brief examination of the data, it is apparent that the majority of FDI flows is still between the industrial countries, but that an increasing fraction is being directed towards the developing countries, especially China. There are two major problems with using such data to test models of multinationals: first, the types of investments have been changing during the

1990's; and second, linkages between firms can come from contractual arrangements across countries that need not be reflected in multinational investments.

On the first problem, Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter (2001) use a more recent and detailed dataset to evaluate the types of investments made by U.S. multinationals. These data include detailed information on the various roles played by foreign affiliates: in importing inputs from their U.S. parents for further processing; in selling locally within the host countries; and in exporting from the host countries. The first of these roles illustrate vertical investment while the second is horizontal investment, and the third could be either. These authors find that both types of investments are important in the data, with a growing share of vertical investments in some industries and regions. It is quite possible that pooling the data across industries and countries as in (11.9) will hide the underlying presence of both activities.

On the second problem, there is no way that data on multinationals will reflect the vast amount of outsourcing between unaffiliated firms. This is especially true of vertical relationships. Nike manufactures all of its running shoes in Asia, but does not own these plants; nevertheless, this is a vertical relationship very much in the spirit of Helpman's (1984c) model. So we should not expect data on multinationals alone to give the complete picture of horizontal and vertical relationships between firms. Estimating the determinants of these in a dataset that allows for both is therefore a challenge for future empirical research. But it is also a challenge for theoretical work: we would like to explain the division between activities that are kept internal to the multinational, and activities that external to the firm. This will be discussed in the remainder of the chapter.

# Organization of the Firm

Both the vertical and horizontal multinational models involved a firm deciding whether to open an additional plant in a foreign country, but neither of these models addressed the question of whether the foreign plant had to be owned by the multinational or not. What would prevent the home firm from entering into a joint venture or some other contractual arrangement with a foreign firm rather than establishing a new plant? In order to explain this, we need to add a richer structure to the models we have considered so far. We shall discuss two explanations for the integration of firms: transactions costs under incomplete contracts; and the “matching” of firms under incomplete information.[17]

# Transactions Costs

A general reason for the existence of firms provided by Ronald Coase (1937) is that there are costs involved with making transactions on the markets, and when these costs become too high, the activities are instead internalized within the firm. This idea was greatly elaborated by Oliver Williamson (1975, 1985), and is associated with the twin concepts of "asset specificity" and the "holdup problem." To explain these, suppose that firm A needs some new input. It could ask firm B to produce it, but that would be expensive for it to design and test. If firm B managed to successfully produce it, and then sell it to A, then what guarantee does firm B have that it will be paid enough to cover its costs of design, let alone its costs of production? If firm

A and B could contract in the beginning to specify what the input would cost to develop and produce, then that would resolve the problem, but it may be difficult to foresee in the beginning what these costs would be.

In the absence of complete contracts, firm B will be left with an input which may or may not be useful to buyers other than firm A: this is called "asset specificity." We can presume that the better suited is the input to firm A's needs, then the less valuable it is to alternative buyers. But in that case, firm B has very little bargaining power in refusing to sell the input to firm A: this is the "holdup problem." Because of the holdup problem, firm B might decide to produce an input that is not very well suited to firm A, but instead can be sold to other purchasers. So the incomplete contracts lead to an inefficient outcome. If this inefficiency is too great, then firm A might decide to just design the input itself; i.e. it will vertically integrate into the production of that good, and thereby become a bigger firm.

From this line of reasoning, we can see that the decision of a firm to integrate depends on the cost of making market transactions under incomplete contracts, and in particular, asset specificity and the holdup problem. These insights of Coase and Williamson have only recently been formalized into models of the firm, and key references are Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990, 1999) and Aghion and Tirole (1997). It is even more recent that these ideas have been incorporated into general equilibrium models of trade, and references include McLaren (2000), Grossman and Helpman (2002a,b), Marin and Verdier (2001), Antras (2002) and Puga and Trefler (2002). These papers are new enough that we do not attempt to summarize their contributions in this evolving area, but highly recommend them for further reading.

# Matching of Firms

Our second explanation for the integration of firms is to share the information that each has about their own national markets. For example, joint ventures between firms in different countries can bring with them knowledge of the supplier and distribution networks in each country, and any other intangible assets owned by either firm. Rauch and Trindade (2000) model this informational issue as a problem of "matching" firms across countries, where there is some inherent uncertainty in the ability to find a good partner.[18] The starting point for their analysis is similar to the one-sector model discussed at the beginning of the chapter, where capital combines with labor to produce a homogeneous good. We now suppose, however, that two producers must form a joint venture in order to successfully obtain output. These producers may both be in the same country (as in the autarky equilibrium) or may come from different countries (in the trade equilibrium with joint ventures). Let us initially focus on the autarky equilibrium.

The amount of output obtained by two producers depends on their complementarity with each other. For convenience, we will array the producers in each country around a circle of circumference unity, as illustrated in Figure 11.5. Let  $z_{ij}$  denote the shortest arc-distance between producers of type i and j, which measures their complementarity. Notice that the maximum value of  $z_{ij}$  is 1/2. Then we assume that the output obtained by a joint venture of these producers is  $y_{ij} = f(L_{ij}, z_{ij})$ , where  $L_{ij}$  is the labor used. We do not include capital in this production function since the amount available from each producer is equal and fixed. We

Figure 11.5

assume that  $f(L_{ij}, z_{ij})$  is increasing and homogeneous of degree one in  $(L_{ij}, z_{ij})$ , so that producers farther away from each other obtain higher output.

If labor is available at the wage  $w$ , the profits obtained from this joint venture are:

$$
\mathrm {g} (\mathrm {w}, \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i j}}) \equiv \max  _ {\mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {i j}}} ^ {\max } \mathrm {f} \left(\mathrm {L} _ {\mathrm {i j}}, \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i j}}\right) - \mathrm {w L} _ {\mathrm {i j}}, \tag {11.10}
$$

where we have normalized the price of the output at unity. Under our assumption that  $f(L_{ij}, z_{ij})$  is homogeneous of degree one in its arguments, then  $g(w, z_{ij})$  will be homogeneous of degree one in  $z_{ij}$ : increasing the distance  $z_{ij}$  between producers will lead to an equi-proportionate increase in labor hired, and in output and profits. It follows that we can write total profits earned as  $g(w, z_{ij}) = z_{ij} \pi(w)$ , where  $\pi(w) \equiv g(w, 1)$ . By the envelope theorem, the amount of labor hired by the joint venture is  $L_{ij} = -z_{ij} \pi'(w) > 0$ . Increasing the wage must reduce the labor hired, so that  $dL_{ij} / dw = -z_{ij} \pi''(w) < 0$ , which means that  $\pi''(w) > 0$  so  $\pi$  is convex. For convenience in our discussion, we follow Rauch and Trindade in assuming that  $\pi(w)$  has the iso-elastic form  $\pi(w) = bw^{-\gamma}$ , with  $b, \gamma > 0$ . This form will apply if the function  $f(L_{ij}, z_{ij})$  is Cobb-Douglas. $^{19}$  To solve for the autarky equilibrium, we need to match up producers in a single country. We assume that producers are uniformly distributed around the circle in Figure 11.5, and that at each point on the circle there is a unit-mass of producers: so the total distribution of them can be thought of as a "unit cylinder." The best matches are obtained when each producer has a joint venture with the one located on the opposite side of the circle, so that  $z_{ij} = 1/2$ . The profits

earned from each of these matches are  $z_{ij} \pi(w) = \pi(w)/2$ . We assume that these are equally divided by the two participants, so each producer earns  $\pi(w)/4$  in the autarky equilibrium. The equilibrium wage is determined by equating labor demand and supply. One-half of the producers are matching with the other half (on the opposite side of the circle), so the total number of matches is  $1/2$ . It follows that home autarky labor demand is:

$$
- z _ {i j} \pi^ {\prime} \left(\mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {a}}\right) / 2 = - \pi^ {\prime} \left(\mathrm {w} ^ {\mathrm {a}}\right) / 4 = \mathrm {L}, \tag {11.11}
$$

where the first equality is obtained because producers are matching with those on the opposite side of the circle ( $z_{ij} = 1/2$ ), and the second equality sets labor demand equal to the endowment  $L$  to determine the autarky wage  $w^a$ .

Let us now introduce a foreign country, with the same technology but having a higher labor endowment  $\mathrm{L}^{*} > \mathrm{L}$ . Under autarky, the foreign wage satisfies  $-\pi^{\prime}(\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{a}^{*}}) / 4 = \mathrm{L}^{*}$ , and would therefore be lower than at home:  $\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{a}^{*}} < \mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{a}}$  since  $\mathrm{L}^{*} > \mathrm{L}$ , using the convexity of  $\pi$ . In the trade equilibrium we allow joint ventures to form between producers across countries. We assume that in such a joint venture, the producers can employ labor in either country: given that foreign wages are lower, they will choose to locate there. This will tend to shift labor demand away from the labor-scarce home towards the labor-abundant foreign country, and therefore diminish the difference in their wages. How far will this process of wage equalization proceed? In the one-sector model used at the beginning of the chapter, full equalization of home and foreign wages would be achieved through capital mobility. That is, equalization of the rental rates across countries combined with identical technologies implies that wages are equalized,

too. $^{20}$  The goal of the matching model is to see how this result is modified when there are some frictions due to the information problems in finding a good partner.

To this end, suppose that producers can enter into a joint venture across countries. If these joint ventures prove to be unprofitable, then their "status quo" position is to enter into a joint venture domestically. Presuming that they still match with a domestic partner at the opposite side of the circle, then this would result in status quo payoffs of  $\pi(\mathrm{w})/4$  and  $\pi(\mathrm{w}^*)/4$  for a producer in each country. Notice that these are evaluated at the equilibrium wages with international joint ventures, which will differ from the autarky wages. The international joint venture will yield profits of  $z_{\mathrm{ij}} \pi(\mathrm{w}^*)$ , where  $z_{\mathrm{ij}}$  is the distance between the home and foreign producers and they employ labor in the foreign country. The two producers will divide the payoff  $z_{\mathrm{ij}} \pi(\mathrm{w}^*)$  between themselves according to some rule, the details of which need not concern us.[21]

Given that the total payoff to a home and foreign producer who match domestically is  $[\pi(\mathrm{w}) / 4 + \pi(\mathrm{w}^{*}) / 4]$ , it is apparent that the international joint venture is equally profitable if it occurs between a home and foreign producer who are distance  $\underline{\mathbf{z}}$  apart, with,

$$
\underline {{z}} \pi (w ^ {*}) = [ \pi (w) / 4 + \pi (w ^ {*}) / 4 ] \Leftrightarrow \underline {{z}} (w ^ {*} / w) = (1 / 4) [ 1 + \pi (w) / \pi (w ^ {*}) ]. \tag {11.12}
$$

Under our assumption that  $\pi(\mathrm{w})$  takes on the iso-elastic form  $\mathrm{bw}^{-\gamma}$ , with  $\mathrm{b}, \gamma > 0$ , we can write  $\pi(\mathrm{w}) / \pi(\mathrm{w}^*) = (\mathrm{w}^* / \mathrm{w})^\gamma$  as an increasing function of the relative foreign wage, and likewise for  $\underline{\mathrm{z}}(\mathrm{w}^* / \mathrm{w})$ . We will confirm below that foreign wages are less than those at home in the trade

equilibrium with joint ventures, so that  $\underline{z} < 1/2$ . Recalling that the maximum distance between any two producers is  $1/2$ , then those international matches in the range  $z_{ij} \in (\underline{z}, 1/2]$  will be strictly preferred to domestic matches.

Following Rauch and Trindade, let us add some structure to the international matches. We will assume that when a home producer i searches for a potential foreign partner j, the distance between them is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution defined over the interval  $[1/2 - k/2, 1/2]$ . Notice that when  $k = 1$ , this interval is  $[0,1/2]$ , which means that partners are randomly distributed over the entire circle (recall again that the maximum distance in  $1/2$ ). On the other hand, when  $k = 0$  this interval becomes the point  $1/2$ , which is the best match possible. So the parameter  $k \in [0,1]$  indexes the extent of uncertainty in international joint ventures.

This structure of international matches is illustrated in Figure 11.5. For a domestic agent located at the point labeled i, the best match would be at the point labeled  $\frac{1}{2}$  on the opposite side of the circle. The range of possible matches are in the interval  $[1/2 - k/2, 1/2]$  on either side of the point  $\frac{1}{2}$ . On the other hand, the successful international matches must satisfy (11.12), which must be at least the distance  $\underline{\mathrm{z}}(\mathrm{w}^{*}/\mathrm{w})$  away from the point i.[22]

We can now compute that probability  $\mathrm{P}$  that an international match is successful. This is simply the length of the interval as  $[\underline{\mathrm{z}} (\mathrm{w}^{*} / \mathrm{w}),1 / 2]$  as compared to  $[1 / 2 - \mathrm{k} / 2,1 / 2]$ , or,

$$
P = \frac {1 / 2 - \underline {{z}} (w ^ {*} / w)}{1 / 2 - (1 / 2 - k / 2)} = \frac {1 - 2 \underline {{z}} (w ^ {*} / w)}{k}. \tag {11.13}
$$

Thus, the probability of a successful international match is higher when the ratio of wages  $w^{*} / w$  is lower (meaning that  $z$  is lower), or when the uncertainty  $k$  associated with international joint ventures is reduced.

To determine wages we use labor market equilibrium in both countries. Home labor is demanded only by those domestic producers whose international matches were not successful, or a fraction (1-P) of home producers. The home demand for labor is therefore:

$$
- (1 - \mathrm {P}) \pi^ {\prime} (\mathrm {w}) / 4 = \mathrm {L}, \tag {11.14}
$$

which can be compared to (11.11). Home labor demand has fallen from autarky due to producers employing labor abroad, so this results in a fall in the domestic wage,  $\mathrm{w} < \mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{a}}$ .

Foreign labor demand has two components. The first is the demand from foreign producers whose international matches are not successful, and by analogy with (11.14), this is  $-(1 - \mathrm{P})\pi^{\prime}(\mathrm{w}^{*}) / 4$ . However, there is also labor demand from all the successful international matches. This is computed by taking the expected value of labor demand  $-\mathrm{z_{ij}}\pi^{\prime}(\mathrm{w}^{*})$  over the successful matches in the range  $z_{ij}\in (\underline{z} (\mathrm{w}^{*} / \mathrm{w}),1 / 2]$ . Therefore, the equilibrium condition in the foreign labor market is,

$$
- (1 - \mathrm {P}) \pi^ {\prime} (\mathrm {w} ^ {*}) / 4 - \left(\frac {2}{\mathrm {k}}\right) \int_ {\underline {{z}} (\mathrm {w} ^ {*} / \mathrm {w})} ^ {1 / 2} z _ {i j} \pi^ {\prime} (\mathrm {w} ^ {*}) d z _ {i j} = L ^ {*} . \tag {11.15}
$$

Notice that in the integral on the left of (11.15) we have multiplied by  $(2 / k)$ , which is the density of the uniform distribution of international matches  $z_{ij}$  over its interval  $[1 / 2 - k / 2, 1 / 2]$ , and converts that integral into an expected value.

Then dividing (11.15) by (11.14), we obtain a single equation to determine the relative home wage:

$$
\left(\mathrm {w} / \mathrm {w} ^ {*}\right) ^ {\gamma + 1} \left[ 1 + \frac {8}{\mathrm {k} (1 - \mathrm {P})} \int_ {\underline {{\mathrm {z}}} (\mathrm {w} ^ {*} / \mathrm {w})} ^ {1 / 2} \mathrm {z} _ {\mathrm {i j}} \mathrm {d z} _ {\mathrm {i j}} \right] = \mathrm {L} ^ {*} / \mathrm {L}, \tag {11.16}
$$

where we have simplified this expression using the iso-elastic form for  $\pi (\mathrm{w})$ , so that  $\pi^{\prime}(\mathrm{w}^{*}) / \pi^{\prime}(\mathrm{w}) = (\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w}^{*})^{\gamma +1}$ . Despite the complexity of (11.16), it is readily shown that the left-hand side is a strictly increasing function of  $(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w}^{*})$ , which starts at unity when  $(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w}^{*}) = 1$  and approaches infinity as  $(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w}^{*})\to \infty$ . It follows that there is a unique solution for  $(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w}^{*})$  from (11.16). This establishes the first part of the following theorem:

# Theorem (Rauch and Trindade, 2000)

(a) The trade equilibrium with international joint ventures exists and is unique;
(b) As  $\mathrm{k}\rightarrow 0$  so there is no uncertainly about international partners, then  $(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w}^{*})\rightarrow 1$
(c)  $\mathrm{dw} / \mathrm{dk} > 0$  and  $\mathrm{dw}^{*} / \mathrm{dk} < 0$ ;
(d)  $\mathrm{dln}(\mathrm{w / w^{*}}) / \mathrm{dln}(\mathrm{L^{*} / L}) < 1 / (1 + \gamma)$ , is increasing in k, and  $\lim_{k\to 0}\mathrm{dln}(\mathrm{w / w^{*}}) / \mathrm{dln}(\mathrm{L^{*} / L}) = 0.$

Part (b) of this theorem is obtained by inspection of the equilibrium condition (11.16). As  $\mathrm{k} \to 0$ , the term multiplying the integral goes to infinity (meaning that  $\mathrm{w / w^*}$  goes to zero), unless the lower limit of integration approaches  $1 / 2$  so the integral goes to zero. The former case is easily ruled out as an equilibrium, so as  $\mathrm{k} \to 0$  we must have  $\underline{\mathrm{z}} \to 1 / 2$  in the lower limit of

integration, which implies that the wages approach equality. Recall that this would be the outcome in the one-sector model used earlier in the chapter under perfect capital mobility. Therefore, the matching model approaches the outcome with perfect capital mobility as the uncertainty about international partners is eliminated. Part (c) of the theorem confirms that as international uncertainty increases, the equilibrium gets monotonically farther away from wage equalization: raising  $k$  increases domestic wages and lowers foreign wages, as fewer joint ventures are pursued.

In part (d), Rauch and Trindade investigate the sensitivity of relative wages to changes in the labor endowments. Notice that from (11.16), if we held  $\underline{z}$  constant (so that  $P$  is also constant), then we readily obtain  $\mathrm{dln}(w / w^{*}) / \mathrm{dln}(L^{*} / L) = 1 / (1 + \gamma) > 0$ . Relative wages are increasing in the relative labor endowment of the other country for fixed  $\underline{z}$ , just as they are in autarky, because more labor abroad lowers foreign wages. In contrast, when wages are equalized across countries then  $\mathrm{dln}(w / w^{*}) / \mathrm{dln}(L^{*} / L) = 0$ , as occurs in the one-sector model under perfect capital mobility used earlier in the chapter. We can interpret this as saying that perfect capital mobility leads to complete integration of the labor markets. Then part (d) states that the matching model leads to greater integration of the labor markets than in autarky, and monotonically approaches the case of perfect capital mobility as uncertainty  $k$  approaches zero.

There are many potential empirical and theoretical applications of this matching model. It is well known that wages do respond to some degree to changes in local labor supplies (see Bernard and Jensen, 2000), so that labor markets are not fully integrated across regions or countries. One explanation, according to this model, is the informational frictions involved in the movement of producers. This outcome is certainly not restricted to the one-sector, two-factor setting, and would apply equally well to the two-sector HO model. The finding of "factor price

insensitivity” discussed in the HO model (see chapter 1) relies on countries being able to freely export the goods which use intensively the factors that are growing in abundance.

If there are informational frictions in the ability to match buyers and sellers in international trade, then factor price insensitivity would no longer hold: a growing labor force, for example, would necessitate increased exports of the labor-intensive goods, but if buyers are hard to find then we would expect a terms of trade decline for those goods and therefore falling wages.[24]

The idea that selling goods on international market requires a “match” between buyers and sellers is explored empirically by Rauch and Trindade (2002). Earlier work by Gould (1994) for the U.S. and Head and Ries (1998) for Canada had confirmed the importance of immigrant networks in promoting trade with their home countries. Rauch and Trindade (2002) expand this to consider global bilateral trade, and show the importance of Chinese ethnic networks in enhancing trade. These networks are measured by the level or fraction of the population in a country that is of Chinese ethnic background, which is entered along with other typical regressors in a gravity equation.

Following earlier work by Rauch (1999), the trade flows in the gravity equation are distinguished depending on whether the products are homogeneous, with published prices; differentiated, with prices that are not available; or an in-between category of "reference priced" products. It is found that the variable measuring Chinese networks enters most significantly in the bilateral trade equations for differentiated goods. This supports the idea that the informational difficulty is assessing these goods is more severe than from homogeneous goods, and that having traders of the same ethnic background can overcome this difficulty to some extent.

Other empirical results that indicate the informational difficulties in international trade come from studies of the large traders in Hong Kong, such as Li and Fung (Slater and Amaha, 1999). Their activities include matching firms or consumers who are the buyers of goods, with the most appropriate producers of the goods, located in China or elsewhere in Asia. The value of these informational activities to the buyers and sellers involved will depend on the type of good (homogeneous versus differentiated), uncertainty in prices and quality, market "thickness", and income levels of the buyers. Feenstra and Hanson (2001) find that these regressors are significant explanations of the markups charged on goods re-exported through Hong Kong. This further indicates the importance of information in allowing for successful "matches" in international trade.

# Conclusions

In this chapter we have reviewed a large literature on the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and multinationals on trade. The early contributions of Mundell (1957) and MacDougall (1960) dealt with capital flows between economies, though FDI can instead involve a change in ownership and location of firms, without any capital flows. The later contributions of Helpman (1984c) and Markusen (1984) focused on the decision to establish vertical or horizontal foreign subsidiaries. The fact that the parent company had invested in headquarters services gave it an asset that could be transferred to the subsidiary. It was assumed by Helpman and Markusen that this asset was kept internal to the firm, but of course, these need not be the case: a great deal of international trade occurs between unaffiliated firms. This creates both an empirical and theoretical challenge of explaining cross-firm versus within-firm transactions.

At the theoretical level, transactions are kept internal to a firm when the cost of pursuing them between firms is too great. This is the starting point for the transactions cost explanation

for the organization of the firm. This idea has been elaborated in the recent industrial organization models of Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990, 1999) and Aghion and Tirole (1997), and has just begun to be incorporated into international trade models. This is a new and exciting topic, which may well replace increasing returns and imperfect competition (in the 1980s), endogenous growth (in the first half of the 1990s) and political economy (in the second half of the 1990s) as the next major research area in trade.

One objective of this research is to identify types of trading relationships that lie in between the two extremes of market transactions and vertical integration, such as when firms engage in a joint venture or other ongoing relationship. We can refer to such trade as a “link” between the two firms, and the set of links between buyers and sellers is referred to as a “network.”[25] As an extension of our study of multinationals, we are naturally led to a discussion of networks in international trade. These are relationships that represent more than market transactions, but less than full integration within a firm. There are many types of economic and social networks that can be considered (Rauch, 2001; Rauch and Casella, 2001), and we have discussed just one, arising from the “matching” of agents across international borders. Since firms will want to be linked with good partners abroad, we can expect that agents will find it profitable to undertake this matching activity. A model along these lines is developed by Rauch and Watson (2002), where individuals with expertise choose to become “international trade intermediaries.” This also creates a role for governments to support such intermediation activities, through trade fairs, associations, etc. Evidently, these ideas are bringing the trader back into international trade, where he or she should have been all along!

# Problems

Our analysis of capital flows in the HO model compared the equilibrium before and after the tariff, with a complete flow of capital, it is of interest to ask what happens to the welfare of the country imposing the tariff during the transition. That is, as the capital inflow moves the countries from point  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$  to  $\overline{\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  in Figure 11.2, how does the welfare of the capital-importing country change? This question is addressed by Brecher and Diaz Alejandro (1977). To answer this, it is useful to work in reverse, and ask what happens if capital leaves the country starting at the point  $\overline{\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , with the tariff on the capital-intensive good applied by country 1.

The outflow of capital from the point  $\overline{\mathbf{V}}^i$  will reduce production of the capital-intensive good in country 1, and increase production of the labor-intensive good. Normally, this would lead to the capital-intensive good being imported. However, due to the tariff in that industry, there will be some range of capital outflow that does not lead to any imports; instead, country 1 remains in autarky but with a change in relative prices. You can illustrate this in Figure 11.2 by labeling a point  $E^i$ , lying on the line between  $V^i$  and  $\overline{V}^i$ , such that for the range of endowments between  $\overline{V}^i$  and  $E^i$ , both countries remain in autarky due to the tariff applied by country 1. See Figure 11.8. Now answer problems 11.1 - 11.3:

11.1 As capital enters country 1, going from  $\mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$  to  $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{i}}$ , treat international prices as fixed. The welfare of a representative consumer in that country can be written as  $\mathrm{V}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{I})$ , where  $\mathrm{p} = \mathrm{p}^{*} + \mathrm{t}$  is the domestic relative price of imports and  $\mathrm{t}$  is the tariff. As in earlier chapters, we assume that the exportable is additively separable in utility, so that consumption of the import good is  $\partial \mathrm{V} / \partial \mathrm{p} = -\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{p})$  and  $\partial \mathrm{V} / \partial \mathrm{I} = 1$ . Total national income equals GDP plus tariff revenue minus

payments to foreign capital, so that  $\mathrm{I} = \mathrm{w(p)L} + \mathrm{r(p)(K + K^{*})} + \mathrm{tm(p)} - \mathrm{r(p)K^{*}}$ , where  $K^{*}$  is the foreign capital,  $\mathrm{m(p)} = \mathrm{d(p)} - \mathrm{y(p,L,K + K^{*})}$  are imports, and  $\mathrm{y(p,L,K + K^{*})}$  is production of the import good, which depends on the labor and capital endowments with the usual Rybczynski effects. Notice that national income simplifies to  $\mathrm{I} = \mathrm{w(p)L} + \mathrm{r(p)K} + \mathrm{t[d(p)} - \mathrm{y(p,L,K + K^{*})}]$ .

Then differentiate consumer utility with respect to the capital inflow  $\mathbf{K}^*$ , and sign and interpret this result, assuming that the import good is capital-intensive.

11.2 The results in problem 11.1 apply for inflows of foreign capital between points  $\mathbf{V}^1$  and the point  $\mathbf{E}^i$ . At  $\mathbf{E}^i$ , country 1 is now in autarky. Suppose that capital continues to flow in:

(a) What is the effect of the capital inflow on equilibrium prices for goods, and on the rental?
(b) Thus, what is the effect of the capital inflow on consumer welfare in country 1? (Hint: illustrate the effect on the rental as in Figure 11.1).

11.3 Summarize your results from problems 11.1 and 11.2 by graphing the relationship between the capital inflow and welfare of the representative consumer in country 1. How does welfare at  $\overline{\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{i}}$  compare to the free trade welfare at  $\mathbf{V}^{\mathrm{i}}$ ?

11.4 Suppose that  $\mathrm{f(L_{ij},z_{ij})}$  take on the Cobb-Douglas form  $\mathrm{f(L_{ij},z_{ij}) = L_{ij}^{\alpha}z_{ij}^{(1 - \alpha)}}, 0 < \alpha < 1$ .

Then solve equation (11.10), and show that  $\pi(\mathrm{w}) \equiv \mathrm{g}(\mathrm{w}, 1)$  can be written in the iso-elastic form  $\pi(\mathrm{w}) = \mathrm{bw}^{-\gamma}$ , with  $\mathrm{b}, \gamma > 0$ .

11.5. In the one-sector model with perfect capital mobility, assume that the technologies are identical across countries and homogeneous of degree one.

(a) If the rental rates are equalized across countries, what does this imply about the labor-capital ratios used in production?
(b) Therefore, how do wages compare across countries?

11.6. Rather than capital flows, let us instead consider inflows of labor to a country through immigration. We will contrast the results of two models:

(a) If there is only one sector in the economy, with fixed capital and fixed output price, then illustrate the effect of immigration on the home wages, and on welfare.
(b) Suppose instead that we are in a Ricardian model, as discussed in chapter 1. Let labor flow from the foreign to the home country, and illustrate the impact on the welfare of workers at home (not including the new migrants). This Ricardian case is discussed in greater detail by Davis and Weinstein (2002).
