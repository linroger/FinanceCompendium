# Foreword

This book is intended for a graduate course in international trade. I assume that all readers have completed graduate courses in microeconomics and econometrics. My goal is to bring the reader from that common point up to the most recent research in international trade: in both theory and empirical work. This is not intended to be a difficult book, and the mathematics used should be accessible to any graduate student. The material covered will give the reader the skills needed to understand the latest articles and working papers in the field.

At the same time, I am aware that many readers will become teachers in the field, especially at the undergraduate level. I feel that it is suitable, then, to start each chapter by introducing simple graphical techniques that can be used in teaching. Following this, I move towards the equations for each model. A set of problems at the end of each chapter give the reader some experience in manipulating these equations. An instructors manual that accompanies this book provides solutions to the problems. In addition, I have included empirical exercises that replicate the results in some chapters. Completing all of these could be the topic for a second course, but even in a first course there will be a payoff to trying some exercises. The data and programs for these can be found on my home page and also at the website www.internationaldata.org.

A word on notation. I consistently use subscripts to refer to goods or factors, whereas superscripts refer to consumers or countries. In general, then, subscripts refer to commodities and superscripts refer to agents. The index used (h, i, j, k,  $\ell$ , m, or n) will

depend on the context. The symbol “c” is used for both costs and consumption, though in some chapters I instead use “d(p)” for consumption to avoid confusion. The output of firms is consistently denoted by “y” and exports are denoted by “x”. Upper-case letters are used in some cases to denote vectors or matrixes, and in other cases to denote the number of goods (N), factors (M), households (H) or countries (C), and sporadically elsewhere. The symbols  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are used generically for intercept and slope coefficients, including fixed and marginal labor costs.

The contents of several chapters included here have been previously published. Chapters 4 and 5 are revisions from articles appearing in Kwan Choi and James Harrigan, eds., Handbook of International Trade (Basil Blackwell, 2003) and the Scottish Journal of Economics, respectively. Some material from chapters 7 - 9 has appeared in articles published in the Journal of International Economics and the Quarterly Journal of Economics, and material from chapter 10 has appeared in the Journal of Development Economics and the American Economic Review.
