In a market economy, the allocation of economic resources is the outcome of many private decisions. Prices are the signals operating in a market economy that direct economic resources to their best use. The types of markets in an economy can be divided into (1) the markets for products (manufactured goods and services), called the product markets, and (2) the market for the factors of production (labor and capital), called the factor markets.

Our purpose in this book is to focus on one part of the factor markets, the market for financial assets, or more simply, the financial market. The financial market is one of the three major components of the financial system. The other two components are financial institutions and financial market infrastructure. Financial institutions are the entities that provide financial services to other entities in the financial system. They include depository institutions (e.g., banks), insurance companies, and securities firms. Financial market infrastructure is the component of the financial system that involves processing the payments of financial assets.

In this chapter, we will look at the role of financial markets, the "things" that are traded (i.e., bought and sold) in financial markets, the reasons for the integration of world financial markets, and the government's role in the regulation of these markets. Chapters that follow deal with the key financial institutions, and the financial market infrastructure will be discussed when we describe the different sectors of the financial market.

# Financial Assets

We begin with a few basic definitions. An asset, broadly speaking, is any possession that has value in an exchange. Assets can be classified as tangible or intangible. A tangible asset is one whose value depends on particular physical properties—examples are buildings, land, or machinery. Intangible assets, by contrast, represent legal claims to some future benefit. Their value bears no relation to the form, physical or otherwise, in which these claims are recorded.

Financial assets are intangible assets. For financial assets, the typical benefit or value is a claim to future cash. With one exception (real estate, which is a tangible asset), this book deals with the various types of financial assets, the markets where they are traded, and the principles for valuing them. Throughout this book, we use the terms "financial asset," financial instrument, and security interchangeably.

The entity that has agreed to make future cash payments is called the issuer of the financial asset; the owner of the financial asset is referred to as the investor. Here are just seven examples of financial assets:

- a loan by Bank of America (investor) to an individual (issuer/borrower) to purchase a car
- a bond issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury
- a bond issued by AT&T
- a bond issued by the City of New York
- a bond issued by the German government
- a share of common stock issued by Apple Inc.
- a share of common stock issued by Honda Motor Company, a Japanese automotive company

In the case of the car loan, the terms of the loan establish that over time, the borrower must make specified payments to the Bank of America. The payments include repayment of the amount borrowed plus interest. The cash flow for this asset is made up of the specified payments that the borrower must make.

In the case of a U.S. Treasury bond, the U.S. government (the issuer) agrees to pay the investor the bond interest payments every six months until the bond matures, and then at the maturity date, repay the amount borrowed. The same is true for the bonds issued by AT&T, the City of New York, and the German government. In the case of AT&T, the issuer is a corporation, not a government entity. In the case of the City of New York, the issuer is a municipal government. The issuer of the German government bond is a central government entity.

The common stock of Apple Inc. entitles the investor to receive dividends distributed by the company. In this case, the investor also has a claim to a pro rata share of the net asset value of the company in the case of the company's liquidation in a bankruptcy. The same is true of the common stock of Honda Motor Company.

# Debt versus Equity Instruments

The claim that the holder of a financial asset has may be either a fixed amount or a varying, or residual, amount. In the former case, the financial asset is referred to as a debt instrument. The car loan, the U.S. Treasury bond, the AT&T bond, the City of New York bond, and the German government bond cited above are examples of debt instruments requiring fixed payments.

An equity instrument (also called a residual claim) obligates the issuer of the financial asset to pay the holder an amount based on earnings, if approved by the board of directors, after holders of debt instruments have been paid. Common stock is an example of an equity instrument. A partnership share in a business is another example.

Some securities fall into both categories. For example, preferred stock is an equity instrument, issued in the United States but not all countries, which entitles the investor to receive a fixed amount. This payment is contingent, however, and due only after payments to debt instrument holders are made.

Another "combination" instrument is a convertible bond, which allows the investor to convert debt into equity under certain circumstances. Both debt and preferred stock are called fixed-income instruments.

Certain types of financial instruments may seem odd at first. For example, there are bonds issued by life insurance companies where payments are made based on mortality rates or bonds issued by a mining company where the payments are based on the price of the natural resource being mined. Once you understand the needs of issuers and the risk/return relationships in financial markets to compensate investors for taking on certain risks, what may at first appear to be an odd or unusual financial instrument will make economic sense. Indeed, the purpose of this book is to help you understand the global financial markets and the players in the markets, so that you can understand why every type of financial instrument traded in the market fulfills the needs of issuers, investors, or both.

# The Price of a Financial Asset and Risk

A basic economic principle is that the price of any financial asset is equal to the present value of its expected cash flow, even if the cash flow is not known with certainty. By cash flow, we mean the stream of cash payments over time. For example, if a U.S. government bond promises to pay \$20 every six months for the next 30 years and \$1,000 at the end of 30 years, then this is the bond's cash flow. In the case of the car loan by Bank of America, if the borrower is obligated to pay 500 every month for three years, then this is the cash flow of the loan. We elaborate on this principle throughout this book as we discuss several theories for the pricing of financial assets.

Directly related to the notion of price is the expected return on a financial asset. Given the expected cash flow of a financial asset and its price, we can determine its expected rate of return. For example, if the price of a financial asset is  \$100, and its only cash flow is\$ 105 one year from now, then its expected return would be 5\%.

The type of financial asset, whether debt instrument or equity instrument, as well as the characteristics of the issuer, determine the degree of certainty of the expected cash flow. For example, assuming that the U.S. government is not expected to default on the debt instruments it issues, the cash flow of U.S. Treasury securities is known with certainty. What is uncertain, however, is the purchasing power of the cash flow received.

In the case of the Bank of America car loan, the ability of the borrower to repay presents some uncertainty about the cash flow. But, if the borrower does not default on the loan obligation, the investor (Bank of America) knows what the cash flow will be. The same is true for the bonds of AT&T and the City of New York. In the case of the German government bond, the cash flow is known if the government of Germany does not default. However, the cash flow may be denominated not in U.S. dollars but in the German currency, the euro. Thus, although the cash flow is known in terms of the number of euros that will be received, from the perspective of a U.S. investor, the number of U.S. dollars is unknown. The number of U.S. dollars will depend on the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar at the time the cash flow is received.

The holder of Apple common stock is uncertain as to both the amount and the timing of dividend payments. Dividend payments will be related to company profits. The same is true for the cash flow of the common stock of Honda Motor Company. In addition, because Honda will make dividend payments in Japanese yen, there is uncertainty about the cash flow in terms of U.S. dollars.

We explain various types of risk in chapter 10, as well as in other chapters throughout this book, but we can see three of these risks in our examples in this chapter. The first is the risk attached to the potential purchasing power of the expected cash flow. This is called purchasing power risk or inflation risk. The second is the risk that the issuer or borrower will default on the obligation. This is called credit risk, or more specifically, as explained in chapter 10, default risk. Finally, for financial assets whose cash flow is not denominated in U.S. dollars, there is the risk that the exchange rate will change adversely, resulting in fewer U.S. dollars. This risk is referred to as foreign-exchange risk or currency risk.

# Financial Assets versus Tangible Assets

A tangible asset, such as plant or equipment purchased by a business entity, shares at least one characteristic with a financial asset: Both are expected to generate future cash flow for their owner. For example, suppose a U.S. airline purchases a fleet of aircraft for 500 million. With its purchase of the aircraft, the airline expects to realize cash flow from passenger travel.

Financial assets and tangible assets are linked. Ownership of tangible assets is financed by the issuance of some type of financial asset—either debt instruments or equity instruments. For example, in the case of the airline, suppose that a debt instrument is issued to raise the 500 million to purchase the fleet of aircraft. The cash flow from passenger travel will be used to service the payments on the debt instrument. Ultimately, therefore, the cash flow for a financial asset is generated by some tangible asset.

# The Role of Financial Assets

Financial assets have two principal economic functions. The first is to transfer funds from those who have surplus funds to invest to those who need funds to invest in tangible assets. The second economic function is to transfer funds in such a way as to redistribute the unavoidable risk associated with the cash flow generated by tangible assets among those seeking and those providing the funds. However, as we will see, the claims held by the final wealth holders are generally different from the liabilities issued by the final demanders of funds because of the activity of financial intermediaries that seek to transform the final liabilities into the financial assets that the public prefers.

We can illustrate these two economic functions with three examples:

1. Richie Calbo has obtained a license to manufacture wristwatches with the logo for the U.S. Navy. He estimates that he will need \$1.2 million to purchase plant and equipment to manufacture the watches. Unfortunately, he has only \$300,000 to invest, and that is his life savings, which he does not want to invest, even though he has confidence that there will be a receptive market for the watches.
 2. Amanda Santigo, an entrepreneur, has recently invented a product for the inexpensive and rapid processing of DNA samples for forensic science labs and has sold the rights for an amount that netted her \$1 million after taxes. She plans to spend \$150,000 to purchase a condominium, \$50,000 on a car, and to invest the balance, \$800,000.
 3. Hasan Rahman, an associate at a major Los Angeles law firm, has received a bonus check that after taxes has netted him \$280,000. He plans to spend \$80,000 on a BMW and invest the balance, 200,000.

Suppose that, quite by accident, Richie, Amanda, and Hasan meet at a social function. Sometime during their conversation, they discuss their financial plans. By the end of the evening, they agree to a deal. Richie agrees to invest  \$200,000 of his savings in the business and raise the balance of the\$ 1 million needed to purchase the plant and equipment as follows. Amanda agrees to buy a 50\% interest for \$800,000. Hasan agrees to lend Richie \$200,000 for four years at an interest rate of 12\% per year. Richie will be responsible for operating the business without the assistance of Amanda or Hasan.

Two financial claims came out of this meeting and the transactions that the parties agree to. The first is an equity instrument issued by Richie and purchased by Amanda for  \$800,000. The other is a debt instrument issued by Richie and purchased by Hasan for\$ 200,000. Thus, the two financial assets allowed funds to be transferred from Amanda and Hasan, who had surplus funds to invest, to Richie, who needed funds to invest in tangible assets to manufacture the watches. This transfer of funds is the first economic function of financial assets.

That Richie is not willing to invest his life savings of 300,000 means that he wanted to transfer part of that risk. He does so by selling Amanda a financial asset that gives her a financial claim equal to one-half the cash flow from the business. He secures an additional amount of capital from Hasan, who is not willing to share in the risk of the business (except for credit risk), in the form of an obligation requiring payment of a fixed cash flow, regardless of the outcome of the venture. This shifting of risk is the second economic function of financial assets.

# Financial Markets

A financial market is a market where financial assets are exchanged (i.e., traded). Although the existence of a financial market is not a necessary condition for the creation and exchange of a financial asset, in most economies, financial assets are created and subsequently traded in some type of financial market. The market in which a financial asset trades for immediate delivery is called the spot market or cash market.

# The Role of Financial Markets

We previously explained the two primary economic functions of financial assets. Financial markets provide three additional economic functions.

First, the interactions of buyers and sellers in a financial market determine the price of the traded asset. Or, equivalently, they determine the required return on a financial asset. Because the inducement for firms to acquire funds depends on the required return that investors demand, it is this feature of financial markets that signals how the funds in the economy should be allocated among financial assets. This is called the price discovery process.

Second, financial markets provide a mechanism for an investor to sell a financial asset. Because of this ability, it is said that a financial market offers liquidity, an attractive feature when circumstances either force or motivate an investor to sell a financial asset. In the absence of liquidity, the owner would be forced to hold a debt instrument until it matures and an equity instrument until the company is either voluntarily or involuntarily liquidated. Although all financial markets provide some form of liquidity, the degree of liquidity is one of the factors that characterize different markets.

The third economic function of a financial market is that it reduces the cost of transacting. There are two costs associated with transacting: search costs and information costs.

Search costs represent explicit costs, such as the money spent to advertise one's intention to sell or purchase a financial asset, and implicit costs, such as the value of time spent locating a counterparty. The presence of some form of organized financial market reduces search costs. Information costs are costs associated with assessing the investment merits of a financial asset, that is, the amount and the likelihood of the cash flow expected to be generated. In a price efficient market, prices reflect the aggregate information collected by all market participants.

# Classification of Financial Markets

Financial markets can be classified in many ways. One way is by the type of financial claim, such as debt markets and equity markets. Another is by the maturity of the claim. For example, there is a financial market for short-term debt instruments, called the money market, and one for longer-maturity financial assets, called the capital market.

Financial markets can be categorized as those dealing with financial claims that are newly issued, called the primary market, and those for exchanging financial claims previously issued, called the secondary market or the market for seasoned instruments.

Markets are classified as either cash instrument markets or derivative instruments markets. (The latter is described briefly later in this chapter and in more detail in chapter 39.)

A market can be classified by its organizational structure: It may be an auction market, an over-the-counter market, or an intermediated market.

All these classifications are summarized in table 1.1.

# Market Participants

Participants in the global financial markets that issue and purchase financial claims include households, business entities (corporations and partnerships), national governments, national government agencies, state and local governments, and supranationals (such as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the Asian Development Bank).

Business entities include nonfinancial and financial enterprises. Nonfinancial enterprises manufacture products (for example, cars, steel, and computers), provide nonfinancial services (including transportation, utilities, and computer programming), or do both. The roles in financial markets played by financial enterprises and a special type of financial enterprise known as a financial intermediary are described in chapter 2.

Finally, although we have focused on market participants that create and/or exchange financial assets, a broader definition of market participants would include regulators of financial markets.

# Globalization of Financial Markets

Because of the globalization of financial markets, entities in any country seeking to raise funds need not be limited to their domestic financial market. Nor are investors in a country limited to the financial assets issued in their domestic market. Globalization means the integration of financial markets throughout the world into an international financial market.

The factors that have led to the integration of financial markets are (1) deregulation or liberalization of markets and the activities of market participants in key financial centers of the world; (2) technological advances for monitoring world markets, executing orders, and analyzing financial opportunities; and (3) increased institutionalization of financial markets.

Global competition has forced governments to deregulate (or liberalize) various aspects of their financial markets so that their financial enterprises can compete effectively around the world.

Technological advances have increased the integration and efficiency of the global financial market. Advances in telecommunication systems have linked market participants throughout the world, with the result that orders can be executed within milliseconds. Advances in computer technology, coupled with advanced telecommunication systems, allow the transmission of real-time information on security prices and other key information to many participants in many places. Therefore, many investors can monitor global financial markets and simultaneously assess how this information will impact the risk/return profile of their portfolios. Significantly improved computing power allows the instant manipulation of real-time market information, so that arbitrage opportunities can be identified. Once these opportunities are identified, telecommunication systems permit the rapid execution of orders to capture them.

The U.S. financial markets have shifted from domination by retail investors to domination by financial institutions. By retail investors we mean individuals. For example, when you or I buy a share of common stock, we are referred to as retail investors. Examples of financial institutions are pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, commercial banks, and savings and loan associations. We describe these financial institutions in the next eight chapters. Throughout this book, we will refer to these financial institutions as institutional investors.

The shifting of the financial markets from dominance by retail investors to institutional investors is referred to as the institutionalization of financial markets. The same thing is occurring in other industrialized countries. Unlike retail investors, institutional investors have been more willing to transfer funds across national borders to improve portfolio diversification or exploit perceived mispricing of financial assets in foreign countries.

The potential portfolio diversification benefits associated with global investing have been documented in numerous studies, which have heightened the awareness of investors about the virtues of global investing.

# Classification of Global Financial Markets

Although there is no uniform system for classifying the global financial markets, an appropriate schematic presentation appears in figure 1.1. From the perspective of a given country, financial markets can be classified as either internal or external. The internal market, also referred to as the national market, is composed of two parts: the domestic market and the foreign market. The domestic market in a country is where issuers domiciled in that country issue securities and where those securities are subsequently traded.

Figure 1.1

Classification of global financial markets.

The foreign market of any country is where the securities of issuers not domiciled in the country are sold and traded. The rules governing the issuance of foreign securities are those imposed by regulatory authorities where the security is issued. For example, securities issued by foreign corporations in the United States must comply with the regulations set forth in U.S. securities law. A non-Japanese corporation that seeks to offer securities in Japan must comply with Japanese securities law and regulations imposed by the Japanese Ministry of Finance.

Nicknames have developed to describe the various foreign markets. For example, the foreign market in the United States is called the "Yankee market." The foreign market in Japan is nicknamed the "Samurai market"; in the United Kingdom, the "Bulldog market"; in the Netherlands, the "Rembrandt market"; and in Spain, the "Matador market."

The external market, also referred to as the international market, allows trading of securities with two distinguishing features: (1) at issuance, securities are offered simultaneously to investors in various countries; and (2) they are issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country. The external market is commonly referred to as the offshore market, or, more popularly, the Euromarket.

Developed, Emerging, and Frontier Markets

Countries and their equity markets are typically divided into three categories: developed, emerging (developing), and frontier (pre-emerging). The differences among these three types are based mainly on two factors: the development of their economies and of their capital markets. Their economic development refers mainly to their per capita income and potential growth. Developed countries have higher levels of per capita income but lower potential growth. The development of their capital markets refers to the size of their market capitalization (described next), the level of liquidity, and the development of their supporting regulatory and legal bodies. These two characteristics affect the growth potential, risk, and liquidity of investments in their markets. Developed countries are found mostly in North America, Western Europe, and Australasia, including the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.

An emerging (developing) market is a country that has some of the characteristics of a developed market but not all of them. Developing countries include Brazil, Russia, India, and China (as a group, popularly referred to as BRIC); Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain (PIIGS); and other countries. A frontier or pre-emerging market is a market that is too small and undeveloped to be considered an emerging market.

# Asset Classes

In financial markets, participants talk about asset classes. In the financial markets of most developed countries, the asset classes are (1) common stocks, (2) bonds, (3) cash equivalents, and (4) real estate. How do market participants define their asset classes? There are two ways they do so.

One way is in terms of the investment attributes that the members of the asset class have in common. These investment characteristics include the major economic factors that affect the value of the asset class, and as a result, correlate highly with the returns of each member of the asset class, have similar risk and return characteristics, and have a common legal or regulatory structure. Hence, based on this way of defining asset classes, the correlation between the returns of different asset classes would be low. Another way of defining an asset class is based simply on the characteristics of a group of assets that is treated as an asset class by asset managers.

Based on these two ways of defining asset classes, the traditional asset classes above can be extended to generate other such classes. From the perspective of a U.S. investor, for example, the traditional asset classes listed above have been expanded by separating foreign stocks and bonds into those issued by U.S. entities and those issued by foreign entities.

Moreover, common stocks and bonds are further divided into more asset classes based on the size of the corporation. Here, size refers to the market capitalization of the corporation's common stock. A corporation's market capitalization (or simply, "market cap") is equal to the total market value of its common stock outstanding. For example, suppose that a corporation has 50 million shares of common stock outstanding, and each share has a market value of  \$400. Then this corporation's market cap is\$ 20 billion (50 million shares × 400 per share).

In the United States, one way of classifying asset classes is based on market cap:

- mega-cap stocks (greater than 200 billion),
- large-cap stocks ( \$10 billion to\$ 200 billion),
- mid-cap stocks ( \$1 billion to\$ 10 billion),
- small-cap stocks ( \$300 million to\$ 1 billion),
- micro-cap stocks (\$50 million to \$300 million), and
- nano-cap stocks (less than 50 million).

Except for real estate, all the asset classes identified above are referred to as traditional asset classes. Real estate and all other asset classes that are not in the above list are referred to as nontraditional asset classes or alternative asset classes. They include commodities, private equities, hedge funds, venture capital, real assets, and currencies.

# Derivatives Markets

So far, we have focused on the cash market for financial assets. With some contracts, the contract holder has either the obligation or the choice to buy or sell a financial asset at some future time. The price of any such contract derives its value from that of the underlying financial asset, financial index, or interest rate. Consequently, these contracts are called derivative instruments.

# Types of Derivative Instruments

The two basic types of derivative instruments are futures/forward contracts and options contracts.

A futures or forward contract is an agreement whereby two parties agree to transact with respect to some financial asset at a predetermined price at a specified future date. One party agrees to buy the financial asset; the other agrees to sell the financial asset. Both parties are obligated to perform, and neither party charges a fee. The distinction between a futures and a forward contract and why this type of derivative is referred to as a risk-sharing type of derivative are explained in chapter 33.

An options contract gives the owner of the contract the right, but not the obligation, to buy (or sell) a financial asset at a specified price from (or to) another party. The buyer of the contract must pay the seller a fee, which is known as the option price. When the option grants the owner of the option the right to buy a financial asset from the other party, the option is a call option. If, instead, the option grants the owner of the option the right to sell a financial asset to the other party, the option is a put option. Options are more fully explained in chapter 34.

Derivative instruments are not limited to financial assets. Some derivative instruments involve commodities and precious metals. Our focus in this book, however, is on derivative instruments whose underlying asset is a financial asset or some financial benchmark, such as a stock index or an interest rate, a credit spread, or foreign exchange.

Moreover, other types of derivative instruments are basically packages of either forward contracts or option contracts. These include swaps, caps, and floors, all of which are discussed in chapter 37.

The Role of Derivative Instruments

Derivative instruments provide issuers and investors with an inexpensive way of controlling some major risks. While we describe most of these risks in chapter 10, here are three examples that clearly illustrate the need for derivative instruments:

1. Suppose that AT&T plans to obtain a bank loan for \$700 million two months from now. The key risk here is that two months from now, the interest rate will be higher than it is today. Even if the interest rate were only one percentage point higher, AT&T would have to pay \$7 million more in annual interest. Clearly, then, issuers and borrowers want a way to protect against a rise in interest rates.
2. IBM's defined benefit pension fund owns a portfolio consisting of the common stock of a large number of companies. (We describe defined benefit pension funds in chapter 4, but for now, the only salient point is that this type of pension fund must make periodic payments to the beneficiaries of the plan.) Suppose the pension fund managers know that two months from now, they must sell stock in its portfolio to pay beneficiaries 20 million. The risk that the IBM pension fund faces is that two months from now when the stocks are sold, the price of most or all stocks may be lower than they are today. If stock prices do decline, the pension fund will have to sell off more shares to realize 20 million. Thus, investors, such as the IBM pension fund managers, face the risk of declining stock prices and may want to protect against this risk.
3. Suppose Coca-Cola Company plans to issue a bond in Switzerland and the periodic payments that the company must make to the bondholders are denominated in the Swiss currency, the franc. The amount in U.S. dollars that Coca-Cola must pay to receive the amount in Swiss francs it has contracted to pay will depend on the exchange rate at the time the payment must be made. For example, suppose that at the time Coca-Cola plans to issue the bonds, the exchange rate is such that 1 U.S. dollar is equal to 1.5 Swiss francs. So, for each 7.5 million Swiss francs that Coca-Cola must pay to the bondholders, it must pay U.S. \$5 million. If at any time that a payment must be made in Swiss francs, the value of the U.S. dollar declines relative to the Swiss franc, Coca-Cola will have to pay more U.S. dollars to satisfy its contractual obligation. For example, if 1 U.S. dollar at the time of a payment changes to 1.25 Swiss francs, Coca-Cola would have to pay \$6 million to make a payment of 7.5 million Swiss francs. This is U.S. 1 million more than when it issued the bonds. Issuers and borrowers who raise funds in a currency that is not their local currency face this currency risk.

The derivative instruments described in part VIII of this book can be used by the two borrowers (AT&T and Coca-Cola) and the one investor (IBM's defined benefit pension fund) in these examples to eliminate or to reduce the kinds of risks that they face.

As we will see in later chapters, derivatives markets may have at least three advantages over the corresponding cash (spot) market for the same financial asset. First, depending on the derivative instrument, it may cost less to execute a transaction in the derivatives market to adjust the risk exposure to new economic information than it would cost to make that adjustment in the cash market. Second, transactions typically can be accomplished faster in the derivatives market than in the cash one. Third, some derivatives markets can absorb a greater dollar transaction without an adverse effect on the price of the derivative instrument; that is, the derivatives market may be more liquid than the cash market.

The key point here is that derivative instruments play a critical role in global financial markets. A May 1994 report published by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) titled *Financial Derivatives: Actions Needed to Protect the Financial System* recognized the importance of derivatives for market participants. Page 6 of the report states:

Derivatives serve an important function of the global financial marketplace, providing end-users with opportunities to better manage financial risks associated with their business transactions. The rapid growth and increasing complexity of derivatives reflect both the increased demand from end-users for better ways to manage their financial risks and the innovative capacity of the financial services industry to respond to market demands.

Unfortunately, derivatives instruments are too often viewed by the general public—and sometimes regulators and legislative bodies—as vehicles for pure speculation (that is, legalized gambling). Without derivative instruments and the markets in which they trade, the financial systems throughout the world would not be as integrated as they are today.

# Financial Markets and the Real Economy

In the introduction to this chapter, we explained how a market economy can be divided into two markets, the product market and the factor market. We then explained the critical role of financial markets in the efficient allocation of capital. Another way of looking at a market economy is by dividing it into two markets: (1) the real economy and (2) the paper economy. The real economy refers to markets where products and services are produced and their prices are determined. The paper economy refers to markets where financial assets are traded (i.e., financial markets) and the prices of these assets are determined. The financial markets include not just the cash market but derivatives markets.

What is the linkage between the real economy and the paper economy? In the United States, there have been two well-known crises in the paper economy that have spilled over into the real economy, causing severe economic problems.

On October 29, 1929 ("Black Monday"), the stock market crashed. The most popular stock market index at the time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell by  $25\%$  in two days and by  $30\%$  in one week. The decline in the value of U.S. stocks resulted in millions of Americans losing a major part, if not all, of their wealth. This loss of wealth reduced consumer purchasing, which in turn forced business firms to reduce operations. In turn, this led to a further loss of jobs. The end result was the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 to 1939, representing the longest economic depression in the United States. During this period, unemployment reached  $20\%$ , the gross domestic product fell by  $30\%$ , industrial production fell by  $47\%$ , and the consumer price index fell by  $33\%$  (i.e., the country experienced deflation). In addition, because of the lack of confidence in the banking system, numerous banks failed as a result of a run on the banks (i.e., many individuals simultaneously withdrawing deposits) and borrowers being unable to repay their loans (e.g., resulting in foreclosure on residential properties). In the 1920s, an average of 600 banks failed each year. In 1930, however, 1,350 banks either suspended or terminated their operations. The next year, 2,293 banks failed or suspended operations, and this number increased to almost 4,000 banks by 1933. It was during the Great Depression that major legislation involving bank regulation and financial markets were proposed by President Franklin Roosevelt and subsequently passed by Congress. Since then the legislation has been updated.

The next major legislative changes dealing with financial markets came in 2008 as a result of what has been referred to variously as the global financial crisis or the global recession. In the summer of 2007, the market collapsed for certain financial instruments (one type of mortgage-backed securities, which we discuss in chapter 30). There was a spillover from this market to the real estate market, which experienced a pricing bubble owing to low interest rates and buyers' belief in ever-increasing home prices. Banks and other financial institutions using excessive leverage and derivative products (such as credit default swaps) faced liquidity problems as the credit markets dried up. The bankruptcy of a major investment bank, Lehman Brothers, in 2008 was a key event that triggered the global financial crisis. The crisis resulted in a slowdown in economic growth and a high unemployment rate. There were fears of another Great Depression, not just in the United States but worldwide. In fact, while the United States experienced its worst recession since the Great Depression, such countries as France, Germany, and Japan realized the slowest economic growth in decades. These events led to legislation in many countries to reduce the likelihood of a problem in the paper economy leading to a severe economic crisis in the real economy. In the United States, the major legislation seeking to accomplish this was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. As succinctly stated in this act, its intent is:

To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end "too big to fail," to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.

We describe various provisions of this act, referred to simply as the "Dodd-Frank Act," in later chapters.

What is interesting is that despite the linkage observed between the paper economy and the real economy when the stock market crashed in 1929 and during the Great Depression that followed, it seems that macroeconomic models did not focus on this linkage until the 2008 financial crisis. As noted in a 2012 report by Germany's central bank,[6] the Deutsche Bundesbank:

Prior to the crisis, financial markets were generally not included in macro models, nor was this regarded as necessary because, for the most part, the financial markets were not themselves deemed to contain any potential to cause disruptions. In the wake of the crisis, however, financial markets have been increasingly integrated into empirical and theoretical macroeconomic models.

# Key Points
- The financial system is composed of three parts: financial markets, financial institutions, and market infrastructure.
- A financial asset (financial instrument or security) entitles the owner to the future cash flow to be paid by the issuer.
- The holder of a financial asset's claim can be either an equity or a debt claim.
- The value of any financial asset equals the present value of the expected cash flow.
- Three types of risk are associated with investing in financial assets: purchasing power or inflation risk, default or credit risk, and exchange-rate risk.
- The two principal economic functions of a financial asset are (1) to transfer funds from those who have surplus funds to invest to those who need funds to invest in tangible assets, and (2) to transfer funds in a way that redistributes the unavoidable risk associated with the cash flow generated by tangible assets among those seeking and those providing the funds.
- Financial markets provide the following three additional functions beyond that of financial assets themselves: (1) They provide a mechanism for determining the price (or, equivalently, the required return) of financial assets; (2) they make assets more liquid; and (3) they reduce the costs of exchanging assets.
- The costs associated with market transactions are search costs and information costs.
- Financial markets can be classified by type of financial claim (debt instrument versus equity claim), by the maturity of claims (money market versus capital market), by whether the security is newly issued or seasoned (primary market versus secondary market), and by the type of organizational structure.
- Derivative instruments derive their value from an underlying financial asset.
- Derivative instruments allow market players to more efficiently accomplish their financial goals.
- Globalization means the integration of financial markets throughout the world into an international financial market and allows (1) entities in any country seeking to raise funds to look outside their domestic financial market and (2) investors in a country to invest in financial assets issued outside their domestic market.
- The factors contributing to the integration of financial markets include (1) deregulation or liberalization of markets and the activities of market participants in key financial centers of the world; (2) technological advances for monitoring world markets, executing orders, and analyzing financial opportunities; and (3) the increased institutionalization of financial markets.
- The institutionalization of financial markets refers to the shifting of the financial markets from dominance by retail investors to dominance by institutional investors.
- From the perspective of a given country, financial markets can be classified as either internal (or national) or external.
- A country's internal market consists of its domestic market and foreign market.
- A country's domestic market is one in which issuers domiciled in the country issue securities and in which those securities are subsequently traded. In a country's foreign market, securities of issuers not domiciled in the country are sold and traded.
- In classifying countries and stock markets as developed, emerging, or frontier, two characteristics are used: (1) their economic development (such as their per capita income and potential growth) and (2) the development of their capital markets in terms of market capitalization, the level of liquidity, and supporting regulatory and legal bodies.
- Developed stock markets are in countries that have higher levels of per capita income but lower potential growth.
- Developed stock markets are found mostly in North America, Western Europe, and Australasia, including the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.
- An emerging (developing) market is a market in a country that has some of the characteristics of a developed market, but not all of them.
- Developing countries include Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) and Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain (PIIGS).
- A frontier or pre-emerging market is a market in a country that is too small and undeveloped to be considered an emerging market.
- Financial assets are grouped together into asset classes.
- The traditional asset classes include stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents.
- Nontraditional asset classes or alternative asset classes include real estate, commodities, private equities, hedge funds, venture capital, real assets, and currencies.
- The real economy is the market where products and services are produced and where the prices of those products and services are determined.
- The markets where financial assets are traded (i.e., financial markets) are referred to as the paper economy.
- Financial markets are linked to the real economy.
