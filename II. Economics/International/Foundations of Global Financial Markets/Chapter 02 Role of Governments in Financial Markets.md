Financial markets play a prominent role in many economies, and governments around the world have long deemed it necessary to participate in various aspects of these markets. This is clear from the history of financial crises and resulting economic recessions that have occurred in modern capitalist economies.

Governments play various roles in the financial system. They can do so in one or more of four ways. First, they can regulate financial markets, including financial intermediaries participating in the market. Second, they can act as financial intermediaries by making loans or guaranteeing loans to sectors or parts of the economy that are deemed to need assistance. Third, governments can influence financial markets at the macroeconomic level through the actions of their central banks. Finally, they can provide bailouts of or financial assistance to market sectors or corporations (financial and nonfinancial) during periods of market turmoil or distress.

In this chapter, we explain the role of governments and government policies regarding financial markets. There is considerable ideological debate about the proper role that governments should play in financial markets, and in the last section of this chapter, we discuss that debate. U.S. financial regulations are described in several chapters in this book.

# Macroprudential versus Microprudential Government Policies

Government policy dealing with a country's financial system falls into two categories: macroprudential policy and microprudential policy. A government's macroprudential policy seeks to reduce the risk to the financial system as a whole. The risk to the financial system is referred to as systemic financial risk or simply systemic risk. In general, the term systemic risk refers to the probability that an entire system will collapse or fail. When applied to finance, systemic risk is referred to as systemic financial risk. The key here is the interconnectedness of the financial system's financial institutions and markets, as well as common exposures to economic factors, not only within a country but globally. In contrast to macroprudential policy, which focuses on the welfare of the entire financial system, microprudential policy seeks to control the risks associated with financial institutions. The interconnectedness of the financial institutions is not relevant here.

As a result of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, policymakers throughout the world have focused on macroprudential policy, as it became apparent during that crisis that focusing only on the safety of individual financial institutions is not adequate to protect the financial system as a whole. The following four causes of the financial crisis showed policymakers that appropriate response tools are needed to deal with systemic risk: (1) excessive use of leverage and risk taking, (2) a bubble in the pricing of assets in a key sector of the financial market (residential property), (3) regulatory and supervisory failures, and (4) widespread failure of market discipline. We describe these causes in the chapters to follow.

As a result of this focus on macroprudential policy, the tools available to governments for implementing such policy and the impediments and challenges to the implementation of those tools by governments are now the subject of debate. The tools for implementing macroprudential policy are described later in this section. As for challenges, there are questions regarding whether governments should establish one supervisory entity to implement all macroprudential policy or share the responsibility among several supervisory entities. When a single supervisory entity is designated, that entity is typically the country's central bank.

# Regulation of Financial Markets

In their regulatory capacities, governments greatly influence the development and evolution of financial markets and institutions. It is important to realize that governments, issuers, and investors tend to interact and affect one another's actions in certain ways. Thus, it is not surprising to find that a market's reactions to regulations often prompt a new response by the government, which can cause the institutions in the market to change their behavior further, and so on. A sense of how the government can affect a market and its participants is important for understanding the numerous markets and securities that will be described in the chapters to come.

Here we discuss regulations. Our purpose is not to provide a detailed account of the regulatory structures and rules. Rather, we provide a broad view of the goals and types of regulations, using the United States as our primary case, although we do mention regulations in other counties.

# Justification for Regulation

The standard explanation or justification for governmental regulation of a market is that the market, left to itself, will not produce its particular goods or services in an efficient manner and at the lowest possible cost. Efficiency and low-cost production are hallmarks of a perfectly competitive market.

Thus, a market unable to produce efficiently must be one that is not competitive at the time and will not gain that status by itself in the foreseeable future. Of course, it is also possible that governments might regulate markets that are viewed as competitive currently but are unable to sustain competition, and thus low-cost production, over the long run. A version of this justification for regulation is that the government controls a feature of the economy that the market mechanisms of competition and pricing could not manage without help. A shorthand expression used by economists to describe the reasons for regulation is market failure. A market is said to fail if it cannot, by itself, maintain all the requirements for a competitive situation.

The regulatory structure in the United States is largely the result of financial crises that have occurred at various times. Until the 2008-2009 financial crisis, most regulatory mechanisms were the products of the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some of the regulations may make little economic sense in the current financial market, but they can be traced back to some abuse that legislators encountered, or thought they encountered, at one time. Further, in addition to financial institution regulation, three other forms of regulation are most often a function of the federal government, with state governments playing a secondary role. For that reason, the present discussion of regulation concentrates on the central government and any agencies it creates.

# Forms of Government Regulation of Financial Markets

A government's regulation of financial markets can take one or more of four forms: regulation of (1) disclosures, (2) financial activities, (3) financial institutions, and (4) foreign participants. Here we discuss each form of regulation.

Regulation of disclosures Regulation of disclosures requires issuers of securities to make public a large amount of financial information to current and potential investors. The standard justification for disclosure rules is that the managers of the issuing firm have more information about the financial health and future of the firm than do investors who own or are considering the purchase of the firm's securities. The cause of market failure here, if indeed it occurs, is commonly described as asymmetric information, which means investors and managers are subject to uneven access to or uneven possession of information. Also, the problem is said to be one of "agency," in the sense that the firm's managers, who act as agents for investors, may act in their own interests to the disadvantage of investors. The advocates of disclosure rules say that, in the absence of the rules, investors with comparatively limited knowledge about the firm would allow agents to engage in such practices.

The United States is firmly committed to disclosure regulation. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 led to the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is responsible for gathering and publicizing relevant information and for punishing those issuers who supply fraudulent or misleading data. However, none of the SEC's requirements or actions constitutes a guarantee, a certification, or an approval of the securities being issued. Moreover, the government's rules do not represent an attempt to prevent the issuance of risky assets. Instead, the government's (and the SEC's) sole motivation in this regard is to supply diligent and intelligent investors with the information needed for a fair evaluation of the securities.

The need for disclosure regulation has been debated by economists. Some economists have denied the need and justification for disclosure rules, arguing that the securities market would, without governmental assistance, get all the information necessary for a fair pricing of new as well as existing securities. In this view, the securities laws supposedly extracting key data from agent-managers are redundant. One way to look at this argument is to ask what investors would do if a corporation trying to sell new shares did not provide all the data investors wanted. In that case, investors either would refuse to buy that corporation's security, giving it a zero value, or would discount or underprice the security. Thus, a corporation concealing important information would pay a penalty in the form of reduced proceeds from the sale of a new security. The prospect of this penalty is potentially as much incentive to disclose as are the rules of a government agency, such as the SEC. Several studies have shown how management can benefit from voluntarily improved disclosure.

Regulation of financial activities Regulation of financial activities consists of rules about traders of securities and trading on financial markets. A prime example of this form of regulation is the set of rules against trading by insiders who are corporate officers or others in positions to know more about a firm's prospects than the general investing public. Insider trading is another problem posed by asymmetric information. A second example of this type of regulation would be rules regarding the structure and operations of exchanges where securities are traded. The argument supporting these rules rests on the possibility that members of exchanges may be able, under certain circumstances, to collude and defraud the general investing public.

Like disclosure, financial activity regulation is also widely implemented in the United States. The SEC has the duty to carefully monitor the trades that corporate officers, directors, or major stockholders ("insiders") make in the securities of their firms. The SEC and another federal government entity, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), share responsibility for the federal regulation of trading in derivative instruments.

Regulation of financial institutions Regulation of financial institutions is the form of governmental monitoring that restricts these institutions' activities in the vital areas of lending, borrowing, and funding. The justification for this form of regulation is that these financial firms have a special role to play in a modern economy. Financial institutions help households and firms to save. Depository institutions also facilitate the complex payments among many elements of the economy, and they serve as conduits for the government's monetary policy. Thus, it is often argued that the failure of these financial institutions would severely disrupt the economy.

Historically, the U.S. government imposed an extensive array of regulations on financial institutions. Most of this legislation traces its historical roots to the Great Depression in the 1930s and deals with restrictions on the activities of financial institutions. (Later chapters explain some of the significant changes subsequently made to these regulations.) In recent years, expanded regulations restrict how financial institutions manage their assets and liabilities, typically in the form of minimum capital requirements for certain regulated institutions. These capital requirements are based on the various types of risk faced by regulated financial institutions and are popularly referred to as risk-based capital requirements.

Regulation of foreign participants Government regulation of foreign participants limits the roles that foreign firms can play in domestic markets and their ownership or control of financial institutions. Many countries regulate participation by foreign firms in domestic financial securities markets. Like most countries, the United States extensively reviews and changes its policies regarding foreign firms' activities in the U.S. financial markets on a regular basis.

# Governments as Financial Intermediaries

Governments throughout the world have been the provider of loans or the guarantor of loans for sectors of the credit market that, in their view, are so critical to the operation of the economy that intervention is needed. In the United States, a federal loan guarantee provided by the federal government is a statutory commitment to pay either all or a specified part of the debt servicing (principal and interest) to a lender or to the holder of a debt security should the borrower default.

In providing loans and guarantees, a central government effectively acts as a nonprofit financial intermediary, borrowing money at the lowest possible rate and providing loans at a lower rate than a profit-oriented financial intermediary would, or guaranteeing loans on which it charges a reasonable guarantor rate. Governments can set up what is effectively a financial intermediary entity by creating either a government agency or a government-related financial entity. Before any government entity can grant any loans or provide loan guarantees, the central government must first authorize and allocate funding for the program run by the entity.

Governments will identify the credit sectors that need assistance. In the United States, for example, the government has provided loans or loan guarantees for qualified agricultural loans, residential housing loans, small business loans, and student loans for postsecondary education. For example, the U.S. Small Business Administration, a federal government agency, does not make direct loans to small businesses. Instead, it has several programs to help a small business obtain debt financing either through a guarantee of a loan provided by a third-party lender or through a guarantee of bonds issued by the small business.

Probably the best-known economic sector in which the government has established agencies or government-sponsored entities to provide credit support is the residential mortgage market. We describe the various entities that the U.S. government has established to facilitate the flow of credit to this critical market sector in later chapters. There is no doubt that government intervention in the housing finance market has resulted in a strong residential mortgage market in many countries.

However, as with any intervention, limits should be imposed. This was evident from the subprime mortgage crisis that began in the summer of 2007 in the United States, a crisis we describe in chapter 30. Critics of the government's role in the housing finance sector have argued that the government has effectively nationalized the country's mortgage system, with three government-related entities, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and the Federal Housing Administration (discussed in chapters 29 and 30), insuring almost  $90\%$  of U.S. housing loans. It is argued that this emphasis on home ownership, along with low interest rates, fueled the housing bubble that burst in the summer of 2007. Moreover, government policies that fostered housing ownership for those who could not really afford the costs associated with owning a home, the so-called subprime borrowers, added to the problems in the housing finance market. Consequently, some U.S. congressional leaders are skeptical of the government's role in the housing finance market and are seeking a quick and significant reduction in the government's role in housing. Other congressional leaders feel that withdrawal of support by the government in the housing finance market will have a devastating impact on the housing sector and the economy.

Estimates of the cost of federal loans and loan guarantees have been made by economists. Some economists have argued that the government does not have the ability to accurately price the risk of loans and loan guarantees. Admittedly, a comprehensive estimate of the value of a federal loan guarantee, for example, is not simple. Moreover, owing to political pressures, critics of government agencies operating such programs point out that the government routinely underestimates the risk to taxpayers of credit support programs.

In addition to government loans and loan guarantee programs, there are government-provided insurance programs. Effectively, the government is acting as a financial institution (an insurance company in this case), providing an insurance policy with no intent to realize a profit.

# Government Influence on Financial Markets through the Actions of the Central Bank

Most countries have a government entity referred to as its central bank. This entity is responsible for the financial matters of that country, primarily through the implementation of monetary policy. Monetary policy is the set of tools that a government or its central bank can use to influence the economy and financial system for the purpose of achieving the country's economic objectives. Monetary policy tools are linked to the banking system, as described in chapter 7.

In the United States, monetary policy is carried out by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the Fed), and the statutory objectives of monetary policy are set forth in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Those objectives are stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate interest rates. Carrying out statutory monetary policy is the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC issued a statement to explain its monetary goals following its meeting in January 2012. The statement indicated that with respect to stable prices (or equivalently, the rate of inflation), a  $2\%$  inflation rate was consistent with the long-run statutory objective of monetary policy, in the view of the Fed. Although monetary policy's statutory objective is the maximum level of employment, that level is principally determined by nonmonetary factors affecting the job market. Consequently, because those nonmonetary factors change over time, the FOMC does not state a specific number for this statutory objective.

Estimates are that the long-run objective in terms of unemployment rate tends to be between  $5.2\%$  and  $5.8\%$ .

The tools available to the Fed for implementing monetary policy to accomplish its objectives are described in chapter 7. The main tool involves influencing key interest rates in the financial market.

In the United States, the Fed is also a lender of last resort, a role that it plays during turmoil in the financial markets. We discuss this role below. This is a function it performs in maintaining the country's financial stability. The central banks in most countries operate as if they had a policy of responsibility for maintaining financial stability.[4]

The objectives of a central bank vary from country to country. In most countries, price stability is typically the primary monetary policy objective. Here are three examples. The Bank of England, the central bank of the United Kingdom, states that its two core purposes are what it refers to as monetary stability, defined as follows: "Monetary stability means stable prices and confidence in the currency. Stable prices are defined by the Government's inflation target, which the Bank seeks to meet through the decisions taken by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)."5 The European Central Bank (ECB), the central bank for the 17 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, states that "the primary objective of the ECB's monetary policy is to maintain price stability."6 The ECB defines price stability as "maintaining inflation rates of below, but close to,  $2\%$  over the medium term." Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan, states that the bank's monetary policy should be "aimed at achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy."7

In addition, in most countries, central banks have supervisory authority over the country's banking system.

# Financial Stability and Monetary Policy

As noted above, monetary policy is linked to the banking system. Financial stability is about avoiding an extreme event that could potentially impose large costs on the financial system and the real economy. It is here that the tools of macroprudential policy of a country are implemented, by (1) enhancing the financial system's liquidity regulation so as to reduce the frequency of unintended tightening of credit, which can freeze the efficient operations of markets, and (2) supervising the infrastructure of financial markets.

Financial stability is critical to the effective implementation of monetary policy. As William C. Dudley, then-president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in 2013:

In my mind, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis has been that monetary policy cannot work properly when there is financial instability. When financial instability occurs, it disturbs market functioning and can also impair bank balance sheets. The result can be disruption to the financial intermediation function with resulting constraints on the availability of credit for households and businesses. This, in turn, can lead to further reductions in aggregate demand that put additional stress on the weakened financial system. Obviously, this is not a favorable dynamic.[8]

Unlike the quantitative objectives mentioned above for the primary goal of monetary policy of price stability of some targeted rate (e.g.,  $2\%$ ), it is difficult to express a financial stability objective in quantitative terms.

# Government Bailouts

Governments throughout the world have used public (taxpayer) funds to provide financial support to prevent the failure of major industries, financial institutions, corporations, and subnational entities viewed as essential to a country's economy or financial system.

This practice followed by governments is referred to as a government bailout, or simply bailout. Table 2.1 lists the history of U.S. government bailouts by type of entity that was the beneficiary of financial assistance: nonfinancial corporations, financial corporations, industries, and one city. In the United States, the two entities responsible for the design and implementation of bailout plans are the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Fed. The latter does so through its lending and credit programs.

# Forms of Bailouts

Government assistance can come in various forms. As explained above, the government can make federal loans. For example, a federal loan of  \$1.75 billion was provided to Franklin National Bank in 1974. The Fed has provided a line of credit for bailouts to facilitate the acquisition of troubled entities. For example, when the investment banking firm of Bear Stearns nearly collapsed in June 2008, the Fed provided JPMorgan Chase with a\$ 30 billion line of credit to support the purchase of Bear Stearns. Although the purchase price was \$236 million, the potential obligations of Bear Stearns that JPMorgan Chase was assuming as a result of the acquisition required that such a line of credit be provided. In the case of American International Group (AIG), several forms of financial assistance were provided: an initial \$85 billion line of credit with the Fed, followed by \$110 billion in loans from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\$40 billion of the Treasury's loan was through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), discussed later in the chapter).

The federal government can provide a loan and loan guarantee coupled with an equity position in the company seeking a bailout. The equity position typically comes in the form of a financial instrument called a stock warrant, allowing taxpayers to benefit from a recovery. Stock warrants were provided in both the AIG and Chrysler bailouts. In the case of AIG, the federal government effectively got a  $79.9\%$  equity interest (as well as the right to suspend dividends to stockholders) in that company in exchange for its 85 billion line of credit.

In the case of the savings and loan (S&L) industry, which had been having financial difficulties starting in the early 1980s,[9] Congress in 1989 passed taxpayer-financed bailout legislation, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, which provided \$50 billion to close failed S&Ls. For the purpose of liquidating insolvent S&Ls, the legislation established the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). The crisis was so severe that additional funding of \$78 billion for the RTC was required by March 1990. In total, it has been estimated that the cost of bailing out the S&L industry during that episode was about 200 billion.

The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout shown in table 2.1 is the case of two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) established by Congress to provide credit to the housing sector in the form of mortgages. These two entities had \$5 trillion in debt in the form of mortgage-backed securities and other debt. Both were placed under conservatorship of the U.S. government in 2008, and Congress is entertaining several plans for the future of these two corporations. The bailout plan for the two GSEs as provided for in an agreement with the U.S. Treasury was future support and capital investments of up to \$100 billion per GSE, which called for the granting to the Treasury of (1) a form of stock (senior preferred stock) and (2) warrants giving the government a 79.9\% ownership stake.

Two banks, Citigroup and Bank of America, received several forms of aid. Both banks had a pool of troubled assets in the form of mortgage-backed securities. The federal government agreed to limit the losses realized on their pool of troubled assets: Citigroup's portfolio had a market value of  \$310 billion, and Bank of America's had a market value of\$ 118 billion. In addition, for both banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Fed committed additional amounts: Citigroup received \$10 billion and \$220 billion from the FDIC and the Fed, respectively, and Bank of America received  \$2.5 billion and\$ 87.1 billion from the FDIC and the Fed, respectively. There was one more component to the bailout package for both banks: money from the program described next.

The largest government bailout was a special program established by Congress in October 2008, TARP, which was part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. TARP authorized  \$700 billion to be used by the Treasury Department to deal with the adverse economic consequences resulting from the subprime mortgage crisis that began in the summer of 2007. The funds were to be used to purchase certain types of debt instruments as well as equity from financial institutions. Although the initial authorization was for\$ 700 billion, subsequent legislation in 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) reduced that amount to \$475 billion. Three of the financial institutions in table 2.1 received TARP money: AIG (\$40 billion), Citigroup (\$45 billion), and Bank of America (\$45 billion, with 10 billion for Merrill Lynch).

In addition, governments get involved in negotiating deals for troubled entities or in assisting in their acquisition by financially sounder entities. For example, a large hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), was heavily dependent on borrowed funds. Because of the Russian debt crisis in 1998, the positions taken by LTCM that turned on the fortunes of Russia's government debt resulted in losses that were large enough to make it impossible for LTCM to repay the amount it had borrowed from banks and other financial institutions. The amount owed was sufficiently large that a default would have had a ripple effect throughout the credit markets. As a result, a consortium of private financial entities was organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the purpose of buying LTCM so as to cover its debt obligations. Simultaneously, the Fed took pressure off the credit markets by taking action to make more credit available. The end result was that because of the actions by the consortium, the government did not make any payments in this bailout (and hence LTCM is not listed in table 2.1). No creditors realized losses, and the shareholders of LTCM realized no value for their equity interest.

Let's look at a bailout by a central government outside the United States. A good example is the Japanese government bailout and guarantees of its commercial banks due to the collapse of the Japanese stock and real estate markets. Since the end of 1989, the Japanese economy and stock markets have experienced an extended period of weakness. The major Japanese stock index, the Nikkei 225 stock market index, reached a high of 38,915.87 at the end of 1989. (As of year-end 2018, it remains less than 23,000.) The Japanese real estate bubble also peaked in late 1989 and collapsed after December 1989. There have been severe ramifications of this collapse in the stock and real estate markets. The first is the effect on the Japanese banking system. The collapse of the Japanese stock and real estate markets forced many major banks into bankruptcy. Many major banks became "zombies," defined as financial institutions with negative net worth. The Japanese government kept these banks marginally "alive" through guarantees and bailouts. These zombie banks had large amounts of nonperforming loans on their balance sheets, were neither dead nor alive, and could not support economic growth through loans.

# Issues Associated with Government Bailouts

Advocates of government bailouts assert that in today's financial system, certain financial institutions or markets are just "too big to fail." More specifically, the interconnectedness of financial institutions throughout not only the U.S. financial market but also the global financial markets results in systemic risk that could have severe consequences for the financial system and the real economy. The determination of what financial institution is too big to fail is not always clear. For example, as explained earlier in this chapter, Bears Stearns was rescued in 2008 through guarantees and the purchasing of its assets by JPMorgan Chase. Yet a much larger financial institution, the investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers Holdings, with 615 billion in debt and with considerable global interconnectedness, was allowed to fail and file for bankruptcy.

The argument made by advocates for maintaining large banks is that the global economy and the global financial system are large and complex. To supply large amounts of capital to multinational corporations and to meet governments' needs require large banks that have the ability to operate globally and provide funding at a competitive rate. The economies of scale that can be achieved by large banks can make that operational efficiency possible. Moreover, no evidence suggests that smaller banks result in less systemic risk. For example, there can be just as much interconnectedness among many smaller banks as among big international banks. The financial meltdown leading to the Great Depression is an example of systemic risk arising from the failure of many small banks.

Ben Bernanke, then chair of the Fed, in remarks to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in October 2009, and in response to a question from the former Bank of England deputy governor, said that he preferred a "more subtle approach without losing the economic benefit of multi-function, international (financial) firms."10 He also argued that banks would have to have plans—referred to as "living wills"—for breaking up once a certain size was reached. Although he did not support the breakup of large banks, he did believe that bank supervisors should impose restrictions on the growth of banks that fail to have good governance and risk management controls.

Opponents of the notion of too big to fail argue that a major risk is introduced into the financial system when the management of financial institutions believes the government will view those institutions as essential to the financial system and will not allow them to fail. This is known as a "Fed put." The risk associated with such a view is that a government safety net will encourage management to take on excessive risks. This is connected to a concept well known in the insurance industry: moral hazard. This concept is the tendency for the existence of an insurance policy (guarantee) to encourage risk taking by the insured and, as a result, enhance the probability of a payout of an insurance policy. Another concern is that banking regulators will be reluctant to prosecute entities that are viewed as too big to fail.

The question is whether too big to fail is too "too big to solve." Two solutions have been proposed. The first approach is a commitment by the government that it will no longer permit a bailout. This approach is not likely to be adopted by governments, or, even if adopted, not likely to be used. The second approach is to identify what is known as "systemically important" financial institutions and impose on any such firms a higher capital requirement than for other financial institutions (i.e., a capital surcharge). A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is one that, in the view of regulators, is a large firm whose failure would cause a financial crisis. The notion of a SIFI was introduced as part of the banking capital requirement regulations set forth by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which we discuss later in this chapter.

This second approach is the one that the United States is attempting to implement as part of its major legislation, the Dodd-Frank Act. Some economists have argued that the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have not reduced the systemic risk through contagion but have in fact exacerbated that risk.[11] As Glenn Hubbard points out, there were two effective ways that the Fed dealt with the financial crisis but are now of limited use as a result of provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act. First, at the height of the financial crisis, the Fed provided new borrowing facilities to supply badly needed liquidity. Instead of recognizing the importance of providing liquidity facilities during market turmoil (e.g., that during 2008-2009), the Fed had its lending authority reduced and its collateral requirements for emergency lending were increased (making it more difficult for an entity to borrow).[12] Second, the injection of public capital to fight a financial crisis, such as the government did by purchasing interests in banks through the TARP program, is barred by the Dodd-Frank Act.

Implementing this second approach requires identifying those entities that are SIFIs. This is not easy. Although the targeted candidates are typically large banks, the Fed has considered applying this approach to large asset management firms and traditional insurance companies. However, these market players do not impose systemic risk, and the cost of higher capital requirements on their lines of business would place them at a competitive disadvantage relative to their competitors who are not anointed with the title "SIFI."

The U.S. financial regulatory framework prior to the financial crisis of 2008 can best be described as one that for the most part limited its focus to individual financial institutions and financial markets. As a result, the responsibility for monitoring and addressing overall risks to financial stability did not reside with any single regulator, leaving gaps in the regulation of different types of financial institutions that operated across multiple financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed this problem through the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which has the authority to constrain nonbank financial entities from what the FSOC views as excessive risk taking that threatens the stability of the financial system. An important role given to the FSOC is the authority to determine whether any action should be taken to break up those firms that it perceives as representing a "grave threat" to the financial stability of the United States. The FSOC is chaired by the secretary of the Treasury, guided by the expertise of the federal financial regulators, an independent insurance expert appointed by the president, and state regulators. Thus, the FSOC is chaired by a member of the executive branch, not the Federal Reserve.

# Financial Regulators Outside the United States

Financial regulations in other countries have many similarities to their U.S. counterparts but some differences as well. Financial regulation in the United Kingdom and China are considered in later chapters. Here we briefly describe financial regulation in Germany, France, Switzerland, Singapore, and Japan.

# Germany

The financial regulatory authority for Germany is the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which was formed in 2002. It is better known as "BaFin." It was formed by the merger of the Federal Banking Supervisory Office, the Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trading, and the Federal Insurance Supervisory Office. This formation provides uniform national supervision of banks, insurance companies, brokers, stock exchanges, credit institutions, and others. All German financial activity is regulated under this umbrella.

The financial regulator in France is the Financial Markets Regulator (Autorite des Marches Financiers). Among its responsibilities are to safeguard investments in financial instruments and to maintain orderly financial markets. Autorite des Marches Financiers falls under the European regulatory authority of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (discussed in chapter 24).

# Switzerland

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is responsible for Swiss financial regulation. It supervises banks, stock exchanges, securities dealers, and insurance companies. FINMA is responsible for two of the world's largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse. FINMA was founded in June 2007 by merging other Swiss regulatory bodies.

# Singapore

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is Singapore's central bank and is responsible for financial regulation, power granted to it by the MAS Act. In its capacity as financial regulator, it has the power to regulate and supervise financial institutions. Frameworks and guidelines are provided by MAS for various types of financial institutions.

# Japan

The Japanese financial regulator is the Financial Services Agency (FSA). According to its annual report, FSA is "responsible for (i) ensuring the stability of the financial system; (ii) protecting the users of financial instruments and services, such as depositors, insurance policy holders, investors and the like; and (iii) facilitating the smooth function of financial services." The pertinent bureaus are the Planning & Coordination Bureau, the Inspection Bureau, the Supervisory Bureau, Securities & Exchange Surveillance Commission Executive Bureau, and the Certified Public Accountants & Auditing Oversight Board Executive Division. Of particular interest is Securities & Exchange Surveillance Commission Executive Bureau, which is responsible for market "surveillance, inspection of securities companies, investigation of market misconduct, inspection of disclosure statements, investigation of criminal cases, etc."14

# Other International Participants

Various entities provide direction, research, and advice to policymakers throughout the world. Here we describe two important international entities: the Bank for International Settlements and the Financial Stability Board.

# Bank for International Settlements

An organization whose mission is to provide guidance to central banks in pursuing monetary and financial stability, to foster international cooperation in those areas, and to act as a bank for central banks is the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), located in Basel, Switzerland. Two primary operational roles of the BIS are acting as a counterparty in transactions between two central banks and serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations. In its role of providing guidance to policymakers of central banks, the BIS has four standing committees: (1) the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, (2) the Committee on the Global Financial System, (3) the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, and (4) the Markets Committee. The objective of these committees is to oversee the adoption of best practices by central banks as they address the various issues they face.

The purpose of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is to educate policymakers on the key issues associated with the supervision of banks and by doing so to improve the quality of bank supervision throughout the world. In chapter 6 we discuss risk-based capital requirements for banks. These requirements are based on the various Basel Accords produced by this committee. In addition, the committee formulated a framework for identifying SIFIs, described earlier in this chapter. This committee has four task forces that deal with implementation issues: the Standards Implementation Group, the Policy Development Group, the Accounting Task Force Group, and the Basel Consultative Group.

The mandate of the Committee on the Global Financial System is the identification and assessment of potential sources of stress in global financial markets. The objective is to aid policymakers in understanding the structural underpinnings of financial markets so as to support central banks in the fulfillment of their responsibilities for monetary and financial stability. As an example of how it monitors markets to fulfill that purpose, in July 2011, a work group of the committee published a paper that examined "how insurance companies and pension funds are being affected by forthcoming accounting and regulatory changes in the current low-interest rate environment, and to investigate possible implications of changes in their investment strategies for the financial system."[15]

A key component of the global financial system is how the financial market infrastructure on payment and settlement systems deals with these infrastructure issues and sets standards for them both for domestic transactions and for cross-border and multicurrency settlement transactions.

Finally, the Markets Committee's purpose is to provide policy guidelines for enhancing market transparency, discussion of developments in finance markets, and an exchange of views on future developments that will have an impact on financial markets. In addition, this committee provides a forum for central bankers to discuss the specifics of their own market operations. The committee deals with topics relating to central banks' practices with respect to the eligibility of collateral because of the integral role of central banks in providing liquidity to the financial system on a day-to-day basis. The global crisis has highlighted the importance of this issue.

# Supranational Organizations

A supranational organization is an entity created to promote economic development for its member countries. Two examples of supranational organizations are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, popularly referred to as the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. The general objective of the former is to improve the efficiency of the international financial and trading markets. The objective of the latter supranational is to promote economic growth in the developing countries of the Americas.

Another international body that monitors the global finance system and makes policy recommendations to governments for enhancing the stability of financial institutions and financial markets is the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Several of the FSB activities that are part of its mandate are to

- assess vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system and identify and review on a timely and ongoing basis the regulatory, supervisory and related actions needed to address them, and their outcomes;
- promote coordination and information exchange among authorities responsible for financial stability;
- monitor and advise on market developments and their implications for regulatory policy;
- advise on and monitor best practice in meeting regulatory standards;
- undertake joint strategic reviews of the policy development work of the international standard setting bodies to ensure their work is timely, coordinated, focused on priorities and addressing gaps;
- support contingency planning for cross-border crisis management, particularly with respect to systemically important firms.[16]

In November 2011, the FSB published a set of policy measures addressing the systemic and moral hazard risks associated with SIFIs described earlier in this chapter.

# Views on the Degree of Government Intervention in Financial Markets

There are two contrasting views about the role of governments in financial markets. The first view is that there should be large-scale government interventions to solve problems that involve massive market failures. The second view is that government intervention is the problem, not the solution, and in fact may lead to market failures by implementing policies that are not beneficial to financial markets.

In this debate on the degree of government intervention in financial markets, Joseph Stiglitz, the 2001 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences,[17] provides a middle-of-the-road view. He identifies four recurrent themes that have been observed about financial markets.[18] The first is that, historically, the occurrence of modern capitalism is the link between financial crises and economic recessions (e.g., the United States, Japan, and European countries). The debate centers on the actions that governments employ to minimize the risk of insolvency and ensure the stability of key financial institutions.

Throughout this book, we will discuss important financial innovations that have led to the creation of new financial instruments in the cash and derivatives markets, new investment strategies, and new technologies for implementing the trading of securities. These financial innovations may necessitate a re-evaluation of the role of government intervention, which is Stiglitz's second recurring theme.

The third recurrent theme is that as financial markets develop, there is development of a more sophisticated financial system. A prominent aspect of this is the formation of new types of financial institutions. The question is how governments should deal with the regulation of these entities.

Finally, as we will see in this book, there has been a pattern of regulation followed by liberalization of certain financial markets (i.e., deregulation). This, according to Stigliz, has been the dominant recurrent theme in policy discussions about the role of governments in financial markets. The deregulation of financial markets according to its proponents is that it enables the financial system to more efficiently allocate capital, thereby benefiting the economy.

Stiglitz disagrees with this view about the benefits of deregulation, arguing that the rationale for liberalizing financial markets is based neither on a sound economic understanding of how these markets work nor on the potential scope for government intervention. Often, too, it lacks an understanding of the historical events and political forces that have led governments to assume their present role. Instead, it is based on an ideological commitment to an idealized conception of markets that is grounded neither in fact nor in economic theory.[19]

Fundamentally, Stiglitz's view is one that is middle of the road. He rightly argues that financial markets are different from other types of markets, such as labor markets and nonfinancial product markets. And it is in financial markets where one might expect the potential for more market failures than in other types of markets. He argues that some forms of government regulation can produce a financial system that can lower the risk of market failure and then identifies those circumstances. However, he argues that in some instances, government regulation (intervention) has caused a major financial crisis. That is, market failure occurred due to government failure, not market failure. The example of government failure he identifies—and the one we mentioned earlier in this chapter—is the S&L crisis.

Trump Administration's View on Bank and Financial Regulation

On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order identifying his "Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System."[20] These core principles are:

(a) empower Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace, save for retirement, and build individual wealth;

(b) prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts;

(c) foster economic growth and vibrant financial markets through more rigorous regulatory impact analysis that addresses systemic risk and market failures, such as moral hazard and information asymmetry;

(d) enable American companies to be competitive with foreign firms in domestic and foreign markets;

(e) advance American interests in international financial regulatory negotiations and meetings;

(f) make regulation efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored; and

(g) restore public accountability within Federal financial regulatory agencies and rationalize the Federal financial regulatory framework.

# Key Points
- A government's macroprudential policy seeks to reduce systemic risk.
- A government's microprudential policy seeks to control the risks associated with financial institutions. The interconnectedness of the financial institutions is not relevant here.
- Governments play various roles in the financial system: regulating financial markets, including financial intermediaries participating in the market; acting as financial intermediaries by making loans or guaranteeing loans to sectors or groups of the economy that are deemed to need assistance; influencing financial markets at the macroeconomic level through the actions of their central banks; and providing bailouts or financial assistance for market sectors or corporations (financial and nonfinancial) during periods of market turmoil or distress.
- A useful way to organize the many instances of financial regulation is through four general forms: (1) regulation of disclosures, (2) regulation of financial activities, (3) regulation of financial institutions, and (4) regulation of foreign participants.
- A country's central bank is responsible for the financial matters of a country, primarily through the implementation of monetary policy, which is the set of tools that can be used to influence the economy and financial system to achieve a country's economic objectives.
- In most countries, price stability is typically the dominant monetary policy objective.
- Financial stability is concerned with avoiding an extreme event that could impose potentially large costs on the financial system and the real economy.
- Government bailouts result in the use of public or taxpayer funds to provide financial support to prevent the failure of major industries, financial institutions, corporations, and subnational entities viewed as essential to a country's economy or financial system.
- Some policymakers argue that financial institutions or markets may be "too big to fail" because of their interconnectedness with other financial institutions and markets in the financial system, and that allowing such entities to fail would cause market turmoil that would adversely affect the real economy.
- Those who argue against the notion of institutions being too big to fail point out the moral hazard (i.e., excess risk taking) introduced into the financial system when the management of financial institutions believes that the government will view the institutions as too essential to the financial system and will not allow them to fail.
- A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is a financial institution that, in the view of regulators, is a large firm whose failure would cause a financial crisis.
- The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) provides research, education, and guidance for central bankers to help improve various aspects of banking supervision, infrastructure market issues, and financial stability policies.
- The Financial Stability Board (FSB) monitors the global finance system and makes policy recommendations to governments for enhancing the stability of financial institutions and financial markets.
