- how financial intermediaries transform the maturity of liabilities and give both short-term depositors and longer-term, final borrowers what they want;
- how financial intermediaries offer investors diversification and so reduce the risks of their investments;
- the way financial intermediaries reduce the costs of acquiring information and entering into contracts with final borrowers of funds;
- how financial intermediaries enjoy economies of scale in processing payments from final users of funds;
- the nature of the management of assets and liabilities by financial intermediaries;
- how different financial institutions have differing degrees of knowledge and certainty about the amount and timing of the cash outlay of their liabilities;
- why financial institutions have liquidity concerns;
- the concerns that regulators have with financial institutions;
- the general characteristics of asset management firms; and
- the types of funds that asset management firms manage.

In this chapter, we discuss financial institutions and a special and important type of financial institution, the financial intermediary. Financial intermediaries include commercial banks, S&L associations, investment companies, insurance companies, and pension funds. The most important contribution of financial intermediaries is a steady and relatively inexpensive flow of funds from savers to final users or investors. Every modern economy has financial intermediaries, which perform key financial functions for individuals, households, corporations, small and new businesses, and governments. In the last part of this chapter, we provide an overview of asset management firm, organizations that manage funds for financial intermediaries as well as individual investors.

Business entities include nonfinancial and financial enterprises. Nonfinancial enterprises manufacture products (e.g., cars, steel, computers), provide nonfinancial services (e.g., transportation, utilities, computer services), or do both. Financial enterprises, more popularly referred to as financial institutions, provide services related to one or more of the following:

1. transforming financial assets acquired through the market and converting them into a different and more widely preferable type of asset;
2. exchanging financial assets on behalf of customers;
3. exchanging financial assets for their own accounts;
4. assisting in the creation of financial assets for their customers, and then selling those financial assets to other market participants;
5. providing investment advice to other market participants; and
6. managing the portfolios of other market participants.

Financial intermediaries include depository institutions (commercial banks, S&L associations, savings banks, and credit unions), which acquire the bulk of their funds by offering their liabilities to the public mostly in the form of deposits; insurance companies (life and property and casualty companies); pension funds; and finance companies. Deposit-accepting, or depository institutions, are discussed in chapter 6.

The second and third services in the list above are the broker and dealer functions, which are discussed in chapter 18. The fourth service is referred to as underwriting. As we explain in chapter 9, typically a financial institution that provides an underwriting service also provides a brokerage or dealer service.

Some nonfinancial enterprises have subsidiaries that provide financial services. For example, many large manufacturing firms have subsidiaries that provide financing for their parent company's customers. These financial institutions are called captive finance companies. Examples include General Motors Acceptance Corporation (a subsidiary of General

Motors) and General Electric Credit Corporation (a subsidiary of General Electric).

# Role of Financial Intermediaries

Financial intermediaries obtain funds by issuing financial claims against themselves to market participants and then investing those funds. The investments made by financial intermediaries—their assets—can be in the form of loans, securities, or both. These investments are referred to as direct investments. Market participants who hold the financial claims issued by financial intermediaries are said to have made indirect investments.

Two examples will illustrate this process. Most readers of this book are familiar with what commercial banks do. Commercial banks accept deposits and use the proceeds to lend funds to consumers and businesses. The deposits represent the obligation of the commercial bank and a financial asset owned by the depositor. The loan represents an obligation of the borrowing entity and a financial asset of the commercial bank. The commercial bank has made a direct investment in the borrowing entity; the depositor effectively has made an indirect investment in that borrowing entity.

As a second example, consider an investment company, a financial intermediary we focus on in chapter 32, which pools the funds of market participants and uses those funds to buy a portfolio of securities, such as stocks and bonds. Investment companies are more commonly referred to as "mutual funds." Investors providing funds to the investment company receive an equity claim that entitles the investor to a pro rata share of the outcome of the portfolio. The equity claim is issued by the investment company. The portfolio of financial assets acquired by the investment company represents a direct investment that it has made. By owning an equity claim against the investment company, those who invest in the investment company have made an indirect investment.

We have stressed that financial intermediaries play the basic role of transforming financial assets that are less desirable for a large part of the public into other financial assets—their own liabilities—which are more widely preferred by the public. This transformation involves at least one of four economic functions:

1. providing maturity intermediation,
2. reducing risk via diversification,
3. reducing the costs of contracting and information processing, and
4. providing a payments mechanism.

Each function is described below.

Providing Maturity Intermediation

Our example of the commercial bank has two notable features. First, the maturity of at least a portion of the deposits accepted is typically short term. For example, certain types of deposit are payable on demand. Others have a specific maturity date, but most are less than two years. Second, the maturity of the loans made by a commercial bank can be considerably longer than two years. In the absence of a commercial bank, the borrower would have to borrow for a shorter term or find an entity that is willing to invest for the length of the loan sought, or the investors who make deposits in the bank would have to commit funds for a longer length of time than they want. The commercial bank, by issuing its own financial claims, in essence transforms a longer-term asset into a shorter-term one by giving the borrower a loan for the length of time sought and the investor/depositor a financial asset for the desired investment horizon. This function of a financial intermediary is called maturity intermediation.

Maturity intermediation has two implications for financial markets. First, it provides investors with more choices concerning maturity for their investments; borrowers have more choices for the length of their debt obligations. Second, because investors are naturally reluctant to commit funds for a long period of time, they will require that long-term borrowers pay a higher interest rate than is required for short-term borrowing. A financial intermediary is willing to make longer-term loans, and at a lower cost to the borrower than an individual investor would, by counting on successive deposits to provide the funds until maturity (although at some risk—see below). Thus, the second implication is that the cost of longer-term borrowing is likely to be reduced.

Reducing Risk via Diversification

Consider the example of the investor who places funds in an investment company. Suppose that the investment company invests the funds received in the stock of a large number of companies. By doing so, the investment company has diversified and reduced its risk.

Investors who have a small sum to invest would find it difficult to achieve the same degree of diversification, because they do not have sufficient funds to buy shares of a large number of companies. Yet by investing in the investment company for the same sum of money, investors can accomplish this diversification, thereby reducing risk.

This economic function of financial intermediaries—transforming more risky assets into less risky ones—is called diversification. Although individual investors can do it on their own, they may not be able to do it as cost effectively as a financial intermediary, depending on the amount of funds they have to invest. Attaining cost-effective diversification to reduce risk by purchasing the financial assets of a financial intermediary is an important economic benefit for financial markets.

Reducing the Costs of Contracting and Information Processing

Investors purchasing financial assets should take the time to develop the skills necessary for understanding how to evaluate an investment. Once those skills are developed, investors should apply them to the analysis of specific financial assets that are candidates for purchase (or subsequent sale). Investors who want to make a loan to a consumer or business will need to write the loan contract (or hire an attorney to do so).

Although some people enjoy devoting leisure time to this task, most prefer to use that time for just that—leisure. Most of us find that leisure time is in short supply, so to sacrifice it, we have to be compensated. The form of compensation could be a higher return that we obtain from an investment.

In addition to the opportunity cost of the time to process the information about the financial asset and its issuer, there is the cost of acquiring that information. All these costs are called information processing costs. The costs of writing loan contracts are referred to as contracting costs. There is also another dimension to contracting costs: the cost of enforcing the terms of the loan agreement.

With this in mind, consider our two examples of financial intermediaries—the commercial bank and the investment company. People who work for these intermediaries include investment professionals who are trained to analyze financial assets and manage them. In the case of loan agreements, either standardized contracts can be prepared, or legal counsel can be part of the professional staff that writes contracts involving more complex transactions. The investment professionals can monitor compliance with the terms of the loan agreement and take any necessary action to protect the interests of the financial intermediary. The employment of such professionals is cost effective for financial intermediaries, because investing funds is their normal business.

In other words, there are economies of scale in contracting and processing information about financial assets because of the amount of funds managed by financial intermediaries. The lower costs accrue to the investor purchasing a financial claim of the financial intermediary and to the issuers of financial assets, who benefit from a lower borrowing cost.

## Providing a Payments Mechanism

Although the previous three economic functions may not have been immediately obvious, this last function should be. Most transactions made today are not done with cash. Instead, payments are made using checks, credit cards, debit cards, and electronic transfers of funds. These methods for making payments, called payment mechanisms, are provided by certain financial intermediaries.

At one time, noncash payments were restricted to checks written against noninterest-bearing accounts at commercial banks. Similar check writing privileges were provided later by S&L associations and savings banks, and by certain types of investment companies. Payment by credit card was also at one time the exclusive domain of commercial banks, but now other depository institutions offer this service. Debit cards are offered by various financial intermediaries. A debit card differs from a credit card in that, in the latter case, a bill is sent to the credit card holder periodically (usually once a month) requesting payment for transactions made in the past. In the case of a debit card, funds are immediately withdrawn (that is, debited) from the purchaser's account at the time the transaction takes place.

The ability to make payments without the use of cash is critical for the functioning of a financial market. In short, depository institutions transform assets that cannot be used to make payments into other assets that offer that property.

## Overview of Asset/Liability Management for Financial Institutions

In later chapters, we discuss the major financial institutions. To understand the reasons managers of financial institutions invest in particular types of financial assets and the types of investment strategies they employ, it is necessary to have a general understanding of the asset/liability problem faced. In this section, we provide an overview of asset/liability management.

The nature of the liabilities dictates the investment strategy that a financial institution will pursue. For example, depository institutions seek to generate income by the spread between the return that they earn on assets and the cost of their funds. That is, they buy money and sell money. They buy money by borrowing from depositors or other sources of funds. They sell money when they lend it to businesses or individuals. In essence, they are in the spread business—their objective is to sell money for more than it costs to buy money.

The cost of the funds and the return on the funds sold is expressed in terms of an interest rate per unit of time. Consequently, the objective of a depository institution is to earn a positive spread between the assets it invests in (what it has sold the money for) and the costs of its funds (what it has purchased the money for).

Life insurance companies—and to a certain extent, property and casualty insurance companies—are in the spread business. Pension funds are not in the spread business: They do not raise funds themselves in the market. They seek to cover the cost of pension obligations at a minimum cost that is borne by the sponsor of the pension plan. Investment companies face no explicit costs for the funds they acquire and must satisfy no specific liability obligations; one exception is a particular type of investment company that agrees to repurchase shares at any time.

## Nature of Liabilities

By the liabilities of a financial institution, we mean the amount and timing of the cash outlays that must be made to satisfy the contractual terms of the obligations issued. The liabilities of any financial institution can be categorized according to four types, as shown in table 3.1. The categorization in the table assumes that the entity that must be paid the obligation will not cancel the financial institution's obligation prior to any actual or projected payout date.

Table 3.1 Nature of liabilities of financial institutions.

<table><tr><td>Liability Type</td><td>Amount of Cash Outlay</td><td>Timing of Cash Outlay</td></tr><tr><td>Type I</td><td>Known</td><td>Known</td></tr><tr><td>Type II</td><td>Known</td><td>Uncertain</td></tr><tr><td>Type III</td><td>Uncertain</td><td>Known</td></tr><tr><td>Type IV</td><td>Uncertain</td><td>Uncertain</td></tr></table>

The descriptions of cash outlays as either known or uncertain are undoubtedly broad. When we refer to a cash outlay as being uncertain, we do not mean that it cannot be predicted. There are some liabilities where the "law of large numbers" makes it easier to predict the timing or amount of cash outlays. This is the work typically done by actuaries, but of course even actuaries cannot predict natural catastrophes, such as floods and earthquakes.

As we describe the various financial institutions in later chapters, keep these risk categories in mind. For now, let's illustrate each one.

Type-I liabilities Both the amount and the timing of the liabilities are known with certainty. A liability requiring a financial institution to pay 5 million six months from now would be an example. For example, depository institutions know the amount that they are committed to pay (principal plus interest) on the maturity date of a fixed-rate deposit, assuming that the depositor does not withdraw funds prior to the maturity date.

Type-I liabilities, however, are not limited to depository institutions. A major product sold by life insurance companies is a guaranteed investment contract, popularly referred to as a GIC. The obligation of the life insurance company under this contract is that, for a sum of money (called a premium), it will guarantee an interest rate up to some specified maturity date. For example, suppose a life insurance company for a premium of \$10 million issues a five-year GIC agreeing to pay 10\% compounded annually. The life insurance company knows that it must pay \$16.11 million to the GIC policyholder in five years.

Type-II liabilities The amount of cash outlay is known, but the timing of the cash outlay is uncertain. The most obvious example of a Type-II liability is a life insurance policy. There are many types of life insurance policies that we shall discuss in chapter 8, but the most basic type is that, for an annual premium, a life insurance company agrees to make a specified dollar payment to policy beneficiaries upon the death of the insured.

Type-III liabilities With this type of liability, the timing of the cash outlay is known, but the amount is uncertain. An example is when a financial institution has issued an obligation in which the interest rate adjusts periodically according to some interest rate benchmark. Depository institutions, for example, issue accounts called certificates of deposit (CDs), which have a stated maturity. The interest rate paid need not be fixed over the life of the deposit but can fluctuate. If a depository institution issues a three-year floating-rate CD that adjusts every three months and the interest rate paid is the three-month Treasury bill rate plus one percentage point, the depository institution knows it has a liability that must be paid off in three years, but the dollar amount of the liability is not known. It will depend on three-month Treasury bill rates over the three years.

Type-IV liabilities Numerous insurance products and pension obligations present uncertainty as to both the amount and timing of the cash outlay. Probably the most obvious examples are automobile and home insurance policies issued by property and casualty insurance companies. When, and if, a payment will have to be made to the policyholder is uncertain. Whenever damage is done to an insured asset, the amount of the payment that must be made is uncertain.

As we explain in chapter 9, sponsors of pension plans can agree to various types of pension obligations to the beneficiaries of the plan. There are plans whose retirement benefits depend on the participant's income for a specified number of years before retirement and the total number of years the participant worked. This will affect the amount of the cash outlay. The timing of the cash outlay depends on when the employee elects to retire and whether the employee remains with the sponsoring plan until retirement. Moreover, both the amount and the timing will depend on how the employee elects to have payments made—over only the employee's life or those of the employee and spouse.

# Liquidity Concerns

Because of uncertainty about the timing or the amount of the cash outlays, a financial institution must be prepared to have sufficient cash to satisfy its obligations. Also keep in mind that our discussion of liabilities assumes that the entity holding the obligation against the financial institution may have the right to change the nature of the obligation, perhaps incurring some penalty. For example, in the case of a certificate of deposit, the depositor may request the withdrawal of funds prior to the maturity date. Typically, the deposit-accepting institution will grant this request but assess an early withdrawal penalty. In the case of certain types of investment companies, shareholders have the right to redeem their shares at any time.

Some life insurance products have a cash-surrender value: At specified dates, the policyholder can exchange the policy for a lump-sum payment. Typically, the lump-sum payment will penalize the policyholder for turning in the policy. Some life insurance products have a loan value, which means that the policyholder has the right to borrow against the cash value of the policy.

In addition to uncertainty about the timing and amount of the cash outlays, and the potential for the depositor or policyholder to withdraw cash early or borrow against a policy, a financial institution has to be concerned with possible reduction in cash inflows. In the case of a depository institution, this means the inability to obtain deposits. For insurance companies, it means reduced premiums because of the cancellation of policies. For certain types of investment companies, it means not being able to find new buyers for shares.

## Regulations

Numerous regulations and tax considerations influence the investment policies that financial institutions pursue. When discussing the various financial institutions in later chapters, we will highlight the key regulations and tax factors.

In chapter 2, we discussed the role of the government in the regulation of financial markets. Here we provide a brief discussion of the risks that regulators have regarding financial institutions. These risks, several of which were described in the previous chapter, can be classified into the following sources of risk: credit risk,

settlement risk,

- counterparty risk,
- liquidity risk,
- market risk,
- operational risk, and
- legal risk.

Credit risk is a broadly used term to describe several types of risk. In terms of regulatory concerns, credit risk is the risk that the obligor of a financial instrument held by a financial institution will fail to fulfill its obligation on the due date or at any time thereafter. According to the International Financial Risk Institute, settlement risk is the risk that when there is a settlement of a trade or obligation, the transfer fails to take place as expected. Settlement risk consists of counterparty risk (a form of credit risk) and a form of liquidity risk.

Counterparty risk is the risk that a counterparty in a trade fails to satisfy its obligation. The trade could involve the cash settlement of a contract or the physical delivery of some asset. In the context of settlement risk, liquidity risk means that the counterparty can eventually meet its obligation, but not at the due date. As a result, the party failing to receive timely payment must be prepared to finance any shortfall in the contractual payment.

Market risk is the risk to a financial institution's economic well-being that results from an adverse movement in the market price of assets (debt obligations, equities, commodities, currencies) it owns or the level or the volatility of market prices. Measures can be used to gauge this risk. One such measure endorsed by bank regulators is value-at-risk (VaR), a measure of the potential loss in a financial institution's financial position associated with an adverse price movement of a given probability over a specified time horizon.

Liquidity risk, in addition to being a part of settlement risk, has two forms, according to the International Financial Risk Institute. The first is the risk that a financial institution is unable to transact in a financial instrument at a price near its market value. This risk is called market liquidity risk. The other form of liquidity risk is funding liquidity risk. This is the risk that the financial institution will be unable to obtain funding to obtain the cash flow necessary to satisfy its obligations.

An important risk that is often overlooked but has been the cause of the demise of some major financial institutions is operational risk. Well-known examples in the past two decades include Orange County (1994, United States), Barings Bank (1995, United Kingdom), Daiwa Bank (1995, New York), Allied Irish Banks (2002, Ireland), Enron (2001, United States), MasterCard International (2005, United States), and the terrorist attack in New York on September 11, 2001. $^{4}$  Operational risk is defined by bank regulators as "the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events." The definition of operation risk includes legal risk. This is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws as well as prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations.

We will continue our discussion of the risks that financial institutions face and guidelines for dealing with them when we discuss depository institutions in chapter 6.

## Asset Management Firms

Asset management firms manage the funds of individuals, businesses, endowments, foundations, and state and local governments. These firms are also referred to as money management firms, and those who manage the funds are referred to as asset managers, money managers, fund managers, and portfolio managers.

Asset management firms are either affiliated with some financial institution (such as a commercial bank, insurance company, or investment bank) or are independent companies. Larger institutional clients seeking the services of an asset management firm typically do not allocate all of their assets to one asset management firm. Instead, they typically diversify among several asset management firms, as well as possibly managing some portion of their funds internally. One reason for using several asset management firms is that firms differ in their expertise with respect to asset classes. For example, a client that seeks an asset manager to invest in common stock, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments (such as commodities and hedge funds) will use asset management firms that specialize in each of those asset classes.

As of January 2018, the largest asset management firm in the world is BlackRock with  \$6.2 trillion in assets under management, followed by the Vanguard Group (\$ 4.9 trillion). Other asset management firms with more than \$2 trillion in assets under management are UBS (\$3.1 trillion), State Street Global Advisors (\$2.8 trillion), Fidelity Investments (\$2.4 trillion), and Allianz Asset Management (2.3 trillion). Of these six firms, four are

U.S. based and two are European based—UBS (Switzerland) and Allianz Asset Management (Germany).

Asset management firms receive their compensation primarily from management fees charged based on the market value of the assets managed for clients. For example, if an asset manager manages 100 million for a client and the fee is 60 basis points, then the annual dollar management fee is 600,000 (100 million × 0.0060). Management fees typically vary with the amount managed, the complexity of managing the asset class, whether the assets are actively managed or passively managed, and whether the account is an institutional account or individual account. Moreover, the management fee is typically higher for managing the assets of regulated investment companies than for other institutional clients.

Although performance fees are common for hedge funds, which we discuss in chapter 32, asset management firms are increasingly adopting performance-based management fees for other types of accounts.7 Many types of performance-fee structures are used in the asset management industry. The fee can be based solely on performance or on a combination of a fixed fee based on assets managed plus a performance-based fee. An example of the latter is a fee structure whereby the asset manager receives 80 basis points of the assets managed plus a fee of  $20\%$  of the return earned on those assets. The criterion for determining a performance-based fee varies. For example, the fee can be based on any positive return, the excess over a minimum return established by the client, or the excess over a benchmark (i.e., some index for the asset class) established by the client.

Types of funds managed by asset management firms include:

- regulated investment companies, insurance company funds,
separately managed accounts for individuals and institutional investors,
- pension funds, and
- hedge funds.

Asset management firms typically are involved in managing the assets of several of the above.

## Key Points
- Financial institutions provide various types of financial services.
- Financial intermediaries are a special group of financial institutions that obtain funds by issuing claims to market participants and use these funds to purchase financial assets. Intermediaries transform funds they acquire into assets that are more attractive to the public.
- Financial intermediaries do one or more of the following: (1) provide maturity intermediation, (2) provide risk reduction via diversification at lower cost, (3) reduce the cost of contracting and information processing, or (4) provide a payments mechanism.
- The nature of their liabilities, as well as regulatory and tax considerations, determine the investment strategy pursued by all financial institutions.
- The liabilities of all financial institutions will generally fall in different categories based on the degree of certainty of the amount and timing of the liability.
- The sources of risk of concern to regulators in their regulation of financial institutions include credit risk, settlement risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.
- Several reports by regulators have recommended guidelines for controlling the risks of financial institutions.
- Asset management firms are involved in the management of funds for individuals, businesses, state and local government entities, and endowments and foundations.
- Asset managers generate income from fees based on the market value of the assets they manage, on performance fees, or on both.

9. The following appeared in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's Economic Letter, January 25, 2002:

Financial institutions are in the business of risk management and reallocation, and they have developed sophisticated risk management systems to carry out these tasks. The basic components of a risk management system are identifying and defining the risks the firm is exposed to, assessing their magnitude, mitigating them using a variety of procedures, and setting aside capital for potential losses. Over the past twenty years or so, financial institutions have been using economic modeling in earnest to assist them in these tasks. For example, the development of empirical models of financial volatility led to increased modeling of market risk, which is the risk arising from the fluctuations of financial asset prices. In the area of credit risk, models have recently been developed for large-scale credit risk management purposes.

Yet, not all of the risks faced by financial institutions can be so easily categorized and modeled. For example, the risks of electrical failures or employee fraud do not lend themselves as readily to modeling.
