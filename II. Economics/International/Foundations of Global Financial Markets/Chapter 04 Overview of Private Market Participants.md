In chapter 2, we discussed the government's role as a participant in the financial markets, and in chapter 3, we described how financial institutions and asset managers participate in the financial system. In this chapter, we describe other private market participants in financial markets. These players include the entities that issue financial assets and the entities that invest in financial assets. This chapter provides only an overview and leaves the details about particular players in the chapters to follow in this part of the book. We then focus on two particular financial institutions in chapters 6, 7, and 8. Chapters 6 and 7 cover depository institutions, and chapter 8 focuses on insurance companies. Another important market participant in the credit markets are credit rating agencies, the three most popular being Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's. Because of their importance, we devote the next chapter to them.

# Households

In chapter 1, we distinguished between the real economy and the paper (financial) sector of the economy. Households, along with nonfinancial corporations, are part of the real economy. For this reason, households play a key role in a country's economy. Through their investment of funds and through borrowing, households play a key role in the financial sector. Their savings and spending decisions affect asset prices and interest rates.

The balance sheet of a household has three components: (1) assets, (2) liabilities, and (3) equity or new worth. When households save, they use those funds to invest in financial assets. The asset side of the balance sheet of households can be divided into two components: assets invested in pension accounts and assets invested in nonpension accounts. As savers, then, households are investors. The investment made may be a direct or an indirect investment. An example of the former is a household's purchase of Apple Inc. stock or corporate bond. Indirect investments include collective investment vehicles and investments made through financial intermediaries, both of which are described in chapter 32.

Households are also issuers of debt obligations in the financial market. They do so when they borrow funds to finance consumer purchases on credit, purchase a home by borrowing funds, or obtain a student loan to pay for higher education. Those obligations appear on the balance sheet of households as liabilities. Finally, the difference between assets and liabilities is a household's net worth.

The behavior of households in the financial market is affected by government policies, such as tax policies that may provide a favorable tax treatment for certain types of investments and monetary policy, as we describe in chapter 7. When interest rates are altered by monetary policy, this action influences households in three ways. First, it affects the decisions of households as to how much to save and how much to consume. That is, a decline in interest rates has the effect of increasing consumption and therefore reducing saving; an increase in interest rates has the effect of decreasing consumption and increasing saving. Second, on the investment side, it affects the asset allocation of households between noninterest-bearing assets and interest-bearing assets. Finally, with respect to issuing debt (i.e., borrowing), it increases the amount borrowed when interest rates are lowered and decreases it when interest rates are increased.

The change in asset values also influences the behavior of households through what is termed the "wealth effect." As the portfolio value of the financial assets of households changes, households' net worth will also change. The change in net worth affects the amount a household is willing to borrow. More specifically, as net worth increases (decreases), households have more (less) collateral that can be used in a borrowing arrangement.

Households are the ultimate bearers of financial risk in the financial system. Although there are financial institutions and government programs that provide different forms of guarantees for the financial products that they issue, if the guarantors fail to fulfill their obligation, the risk is borne by households. On the issuance/liability side, as borrowers, households are a source of considerable credit risk in the financial system. Some loans by households are guaranteed by the central governments, agencies that they create, or subgovernment entities.

# Nonfinancial Corporations

Nonfarm corporations are classified as financial corporations or nonfinancial corporations. Financial corporations include depository institutions, insurance companies, and investment companies. Nonfinancial corporations issue securities. They issue both common stock and debt obligations. In addition, corporations with excess cash to invest participate in financial markets by investing those funds on a short-term basis.

Some nonfinancial corporations have subsidiaries that are involved in the same activities as financial corporations and are referred to as captive finance companies. Three examples of U.S. captive finance companies are Ford Motor Credit (a subsidiary of Ford Motor Company) and General Electric Credit Corporation (a subsidiary of General Electric Company), and Caterpillar Finance Corporation (a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc.). Many of the larger U.S. nonfinancial corporations have non-U.S. captive companies. For example, Ford Motor Company has Ford Credit Europe Bank Plc, Ford Capital B.V., Ford Credit Canada Ltd., Ford Credit Australia Ltd, Ford Credit de Mexico, Ford Credit Co. S.A. de C.V., Ford Motor Credit Co. of New Zealand Ltd. and Ford Motor Credit Co. of Puerto Rico. Hyundai Capital Services, a subsidiary of South Korea's Hyundai Motor Company, provides a wide range of financial products and services. Hyundai Motor Company has subsidiaries in other countries that are captive finance companies. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is Hyundai Capital UK Limited (a joint venture company established between Santander Consumer UK), Hyundai Motor UK, and Kia Motors UK.

Corporations make available various types of pension plans for their employees. In the case of defined benefit pension plans sponsored by corporations, the sponsor has the same choices as those of state and local governments that sponsor such plans: internal management, external management, or a combination of both.

# Depository Institutions

Depository institutions include commercial banks, S&L associations, savings banks, and credit unions. Basically, with the funds that depository institutions raise through deposits and other funding sources, they make direct loans to individuals, nonfinancial and financial businesses, and state and local governments. They generate a profit, as explained in chapter 3, by earning a spread between the return realized on their investment and the cost of obtaining funds. Because of their important role in financial markets, they are highly regulated, and we devote chapter 6 to them.

# Insurance Companies

Insurance companies provide insurance protection against the occurrence of future events that will adversely affect the insured and are therefore risk bearers. For providing this protection (i.e., accepting the associated risk), they receive an insurance premium. Between the time the insurance premium is paid to the insurance company and the time the company pays out claims to policyholders, the company can invest the premium in the financial market.

Insurance companies sell both investment-oriented and pure insurance products. The types of pure insurance products, and how they are classified in the insurance industry, are life insurance, health insurance, property and casualty insurance, liability insurance, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance. Certain insurance companies provide protection in the form of financial guarantees. The major participants in the financial system among the different types of insurance companies are life insurance companies. Although life insurance companies are risk bearers, there are some products they issue that are investment products. We devote chapter 8 to insurance companies.

# Investment Companies

Investment companies are financial intermediaries that sell shares to the public and invest the proceeds in a diversified portfolio of financial assets. Each share represents a proportional interest in the net assets in which the funds are invested. Because the primary regulator of investment companies is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), these companies are referred to as registered investment companies. Investment companies are divided into open-end companies and closed-end companies. While both types of investment companies are popularly referred to as "mutual funds," technically only open-end funds are mutual funds.

Investment companies are collective investment vehicles and are described in more detail in chapter 32.

# Private Pension Funds

A pension fund is established for the purpose of providing benefits on retirement for designated groups of employees or professionals. The fund's pool of assets is purchased with the contributions to the pension plan for the exclusive purpose of financing pension plan benefits. The members of the pension fund or pension plan have a legal or beneficial right or some other form contractual claim against the pool of assets. A pension plan sponsor is the entity that designs, negotiates, and typically helps administer a pension plan for its members. A private pension fund is administered by an institution other than a government entity.

Many countries have created vehicles for their citizens to save funds in a pension plan in order to complement their private savings when they retire. Pension plans can be employee (occupational) vehicles or pension vehicles. The vehicles can be a pension fund, a pension insurance contract, or a product created by a bank of an investment company.

An occupational pension plan is linked to an employment or professional relationship between the plan member and the entity that establishes the plan (the plan sponsor). These plans are established by employers or groups of employers in the same industry (i.e., industry associations), professional associations, and labor associations. A pension plan that is not an occupational pension plan is a referred to as a personal pension plan. Some countries, such as the United States, have both types of pension plans, but others have only one type of plan.

Different private pension vehicles can be used to provide a pension. The three major ones are pension funds, pension insurance contracts, and book reserves.

A book reserves pension vehicle is one in which employers put money aside for their employees' retirement on their books. This type private pension vehicle exists in Germany.

For the private pension sector, there are pension insurance contracts, which we will discuss. For some countries, the largest ratio of pension-related assets to gross domestic product (GDP) is the largest part of private pension investments. In Denmark, where specialized insurance companies hold pension-related assets, the ratio is  $67\%$ .

To appreciate the importance of pension vehicles as investors in financial markets, a study by the OECD reported that the assets invested in 2015 by 35 OECD countries was US $39.6 trillion. In a survey of 45 nonOECD countries, the amount invested that same year was$ 1.3 trillion. In terms of investor share, pension vehicles were first, followed by depository institutions, investment companies, and insurance companies.

In terms of U.S. dollars, the five countries with the largest private pension fund total investment in 2015, accounting for  $85\%$  of total investments by OECD countries, were the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and the Netherlands. The number of pension funds varies greatly by country. For OECD countries, the five countries with the largest number of pension funds in 2015 were the United States (685,203), Australia (559,547), Ireland (67,840), the United Kingdom (43,690), and Canada (8,876).

# The U.S. Private Pension System

In this section we look at the U.S. private pension system. The appendix to this chapter provides more information about the U.S. private pension system.

Individual retirement accounts An individual retirement account (IRA) is a tax-advantaged investment account that allows individuals to invest to accumulate retirement funds. The tax advantage of a qualified plan is that investment income (i.e., capital gains, dividends, and interest) is not taxed until funds are withdrawn. There is another tax advantage, depending on the type of IRA, whether traditional or Roth. In a traditional IRA, the amount invested (the maximum being specified by law) is deducted from taxable income for the year of the contribution. Thus, the individual is investing pre-tax income. When the funds are withdrawn by the individual, ordinary income, not capital gains, taxes are paid on the entire amount withdrawn. With a Roth IRA, the amount invested is not deducted from taxable income in the year contributed (i.e., the individual is investing after-tax income). Because taxes are paid on the amount invested, when the funds are withdrawn, no tax is paid on the amount that was invested or earned (no taxes at all).

The allocation of the funds in the IRA is determined by the individual. All of the financial risks are assumed by the individual. Funds can be allocated to individual stocks or bonds or invested in one of the collective investment vehicles described later.

Defined benefit plans With a defined benefit plan, the plan sponsor agrees to pay qualified employees covered by the plan benefits on retirement. The amount of the retirement benefit is determined by a formula that is based on a percentage of earnings and the number of years employed. The plan sponsor can be a single corporation; a union or a group of corporations, usually in a related industry; or a government entity.

Corporate-sponsored plans are referred to as private plans, whereas government-sponsored plans are referred to as public plans. Defined benefit plans sponsored by a union or a group of corporations are referred to as Taft-Hartley multiemployer plans. Defined benefit plans may be managed by the sponsor internally (i.e., with a portfolio management team composed of employees of the plan sponsor) or by an external asset management firm.

The liabilities of the pension plan are then those of the plan sponsor. So, for example, the obligations of General Electric's defined benefit plan are the liabilities of General Electric. From the employee's perspective, the financial risk associated with the future payments of a defined benefit plan are those of the sponsor. However, sponsors are corporations and state and local governments, and such entities can go into bankruptcy. For qualified private defined benefit plans, a federal government agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), insures those plans. However, the PBGC's guarantee is not a guarantee by the U.S. government. Moreover, the likelihood is that without a bailout, the PBGC will not have sufficient funds to pay off the obligations that it has insured. This supports what was stated when we described households: The household is the ultimate risk bearer.

The number of U.S. defined benefit plans has been declining, as it has been in other countries. In 2011, of all private sector establishments that could sponsor a defined benefit plan, only  $10\%$  did so. Those private-sector defined benefit plans covered only  $18\%$  of workers in the private sector. In contrast to the private sector, state and local governments (i.e., public plans) covered  $78\%$  of their employees. Not only is the number of plan sponsors in the private sector decreasing, but those corporations that had defined benefit plans are closing them to new employees. For example, General Electric announced in December 2010 that it was closing its defined benefit plan to new employees. Instead, employees would be given a different plan, the one we discuss next.

Defined contribution plans In a defined contribution plan, the plan sponsor is responsible only for making specified contributions to the plan on behalf of qualifying participants, not specified payments to the employee after retirement. The amount contributed is typically either a percentage of the employee's salary or a percentage of the employer's profits. The plan sponsor does not guarantee any specific amount at retirement. The payments that will be made to qualifying participants on retirement depend on the growth of the plan assets. That is, retirement benefit payments are determined by the investment performance of the funds in which the assets are invested and are not guaranteed by the plan sponsor. The plan sponsor gives the participants various options as to the investment vehicles in which they may invest. Defined contribution pension plans come in several legal forms: 401(k) plans, money purchase pension plans, and employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).

By far the fastest-growing sector of the defined contribution plan is the  $401(\mathrm{k})$  plan or its equivalent in the nonprofit sector, the  $403(\mathrm{b})$  plan, and in the public sector, the 457 plan. To the firm, this kind of plan offers the lowest costs and the fewest administrative problems. The employer makes a specified contribution to a specific plan or program, and the employee chooses how it is invested.[2] To the employee, the plan is attractive because it offers some control over how the pension money is managed. In fact, plan sponsors frequently offer participants the opportunity to invest in one or more families of mutual funds. More than half of all defined contribution plans offered by public institutions (such as state governments) use mutual funds, and the percentage of private corporations that use this approach is even higher.

Employees in the corporate, as well as the public, sector have responded favorably with almost half of all assets in defined contribution pensions now invested in mutual funds. Regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Labor require firms to offer their employees a set of distinctive choices, a development that has further encouraged pension plans to opt for the mutual fund approach, because families of mutual funds can readily provide investment vehicles offering different investment objectives.

Several fundamental differences separate defined benefit plans from defined contribution plans. In the defined benefit plan, the plan sponsor guarantees the retirement benefits, makes the investment choices, and bears the investment risk if the investments do not earn enough to fund the guaranteed retirement benefits. In a defined contribution plan, by contrast, the employer does not guarantee any retirement benefits but does agree to make specified contributions to the employee's account; the employee selects the investment options, and the employee's retirement payments come from the return on the investment portfolio, plus, of course, the employee and employer contributions.

# Nonprofit Organizations

Nongovernmental entities can be classified as commercial enterprises or nonprofit (or not-for-profit) organizations. The distinction between the two entities is that commercial enterprises have as their primary objective the generation of a profit. Nonprofit organizations are not motivated by profit or any monetary gain but have as their primary objective financially supporting or actively engaging in activities that will benefit some specific public or private interest, such as humanitarian aid, education, the arts, or religion.

Nonprofit organizations include foundations and endowments. There are differences between the two regarding the requirements necessary for the tax-exempt treatment of income generated from their investment funds. But the main difference between these two types of nonprofit organizations is that foundations are established with funds by a donor and no additional funds are added, whereas an endowment can continue to raise funds from the public on an ongoing basis. Foundations are established by wealthy individuals and families. Some foundations are company sponsored or linked to certain communities. Still others are termed operating foundations, because they award most of their gifts to their own units rather than to organizations outside the foundation. Endowment funds are commonly established by colleges and universities, hospitals, and religious organizations.

The five wealthiest foundations, corporate foundations, and community foundations are the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in the United States (endowment of about US45 billion), the Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom States (US27 billion), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the United States (US18 billion), the Garfield Weston Foundation in the United Kingdom (about US$16 billion), and the Stitching INGKA Foundation in the Netherlands (about US$13 billion). The five universities with the largest endowments are Harvard (endowment of about US$38 billion), Yale (about US$26 billion), Princeton (about US$24 billion), Stanford (about US$23 billion), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US14 billion).

The board of trustees of the foundation or endowment specifies the investment objectives and the acceptable investment alternatives. The funds can be managed either in house or by external fund managers. Several universities with large endowments have formed their own asset management firms. For example, in 1974, Harvard University, the largest university endowment fund, formed Harvard Management Company to manage its endowment and related financial assets with the singular mission of producing "long-term investment results to support the educational and research goals of the University."3

# Foreign Investors

Foreign investors that participate a country's financial market include individuals, nonfinancial businesses, and financial entities that are not domiciled in that country, as well as foreign central governments, supranationals, and sovereign wealth funds. Two types of investments can be made by foreign entities: foreign direct investments and foreign portfolio investments.

The OECD defines a foreign direct investment (FDI) as follows:

FDI is defined as cross-border investment by a resident entity in one economy with the objective of obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy. The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise and a significant degree of influence by the direct investor on the management of the enterprise. Ownership of at least  $10\%$  of the voting power, representing the influence by the investor, is the basic criterion used. $^{4}$

In contrast to an FDI, a foreign portfolio investment (FPI) is of a more temporary nature. Investment instruments, such as stocks and bonds, are normally traded in FPIs.

Central banks, supranationals, and sovereign wealth funds may participate in a country's financial market. A central bank may participate in another country's financial market through its central bank; we describe the role of central banks in chapter 7. A central bank participates by buying or selling financial assets in another country's financial market either to stabilize that country's currency relative to its domestic currency or as an investment vehicle (buying if an asset is perceived to be attractive and selling if a holding is perceived to be unattractive).

A supranational institution is an organization formed by two or more central governments through international treaties. These supranational institutions promote economic development for their member countries. Two examples of supranational institutions are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, popularly referred to as the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. The general objective of the former is to improve the efficiency of the international financial and trading markets. The objective of the latter is to promote economic growth in the developing countries of the Americas.

Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are countryor state-owned investment funds that countries establish. The funds for an SWF are obtained from proceeds from one or more of the following sources: (1) exports of natural resources, (2) privatizations of previously state-owned companies or enterprises, (3) government fiscal surpluses, (4) balance-of-payment surpluses, and (5) earnings from official foreign currency operations. Of course, the primary motive given for the establishment of an SWF has been to maximize returns available from investments outside the country that has established the SWF.

Since the establishment of the first SWF by Kuwait in 1953 (the Kuwait Investment Authority), motivated by that government's objective to protect the national standard of living from fluctuations in the price of its primary export (oil), the twenty-first century has seen significant growth in the number of SWFs. There are two reasons for the growth in the number and amount of assets accumulated by SWFs. The first is the commodity price boom in countries where either the government controls the exports or heavy taxes are imposed on the revenues received from such exports. The second reason is that the governments of many emerging market countries have run persistent current account surpluses greater than needed, thereby accumulating large stockpiles of international reserves with the intent of investing them in high-yield assets outside their country.[5]

According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the five largest SWFs, based on assets under management as of June 2016, were Norway's Government Pension Fund (873 billion), China's China Investment Corporation (814 billion), the UAE's Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (792 billion), Kuwait's Kuwait Investment Authority (592 billion), and Saudi Arabia's SAMA Foreign Holdings (582 billion).

The increase in the number of SWFs and their expanded role have prompted considerable debate as to the motives of these investment funds beyond that of enhanced return performance in several countries and the implications for the national security of countries where SWFs invest. One concern is that some SWFs have invested in technology companies that produce strategic military technology, allowing the SWFs to potentially obtain trade secrets. Another is that SWFs may hold a major interest in commercial enterprises of national concerns beyond the military sector. Because of the lack of transparency in SWF operations, some governments are concerned about such noncommercial motivations of SWFs. Yet the potential capital injections that can be provided to some essential industries in some countries appear to override any national security concerns.[7]

Appendix: U.S. Pension Regulations and Issues

The U.S. Congress passed comprehensive legislation in 1974 to regulate pension plans. This legislation, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), is fairly technical in its details. For our purposes, it is necessary only to understand its major provisions.

First, ERISA established funding standards for the minimum contributions that a plan sponsor must make to the pension plan to satisfy the actuarially projected benefit payments.

Prior to the enactment of ERISA, many corporate plan sponsors followed a pay-as-you-go funding policy. That is, when an employee retired, the corporate plan sponsor took the necessary retirement benefits out of current cash flow. Under ERISA, such a practice is no longer allowed. Instead, the program must be funded; that is, regular contributions to an investment pool along with investment earnings must be sufficient to pay the employee retirement benefits.

Second, ERISA established fiduciary standards for pension fund trustees, managers, or advisers. Specifically, all parties responsible for the management of a pension fund are guided by the judgment of what is called a "prudent man" in seeking to determine which investments are proper. Because a trustee is responsible for other people's money, it is necessary to ensure that the trustee takes the role seriously. To fulfill their responsibilities, trustees must act as reasonably prudent persons to acquire and use the information pertinent to making an investment decision.

Third, ERISA establishes minimum vesting standards. For example, the law specifies that, after five years of employment, a plan participant is entitled to  $25\%$  of accrued pension benefits. The percentage of entitlement increases to  $100\%$  after 10 years. Additional vesting requirements are noted in ERISA. Finally, ERISA created the PBGC to insure vested pension benefits. The insurance program is funded from annual premiums that must be paid by pension plans. We'll have more to say about the PBGC shortly.

Responsibility for administering ERISA is delegated to the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service. To ensure that a pension plan is in compliance with ERISA, periodic reporting and disclosure statements must be filed with these government agencies. It is important to recognize that ERISA does not require that a corporation establish a pension plan. If a corporation does establish a defined benefit plan, however, it must comply with the numerous and complex regulations set forth in ERISA.

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation

The U.S. government agency responsible for protecting the retirement benefits of workers of qualified private employer-sponsored defined benefit plans is the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Two separate insurance programs are under the PBGC's purview: single-employer and multiemployer plan insurance programs.

Created in 1974 as part of ERISA, PBGC has a threefold mission: (1) to encourage the continuation and maintenance of private-sector defined benefit plans, (2) to provide timely and uninterrupted payment of pension benefits, and (3) to keep pension insurance premiums at a minimum. By law, the PBGC must be self-financed. Moreover, as noted in the annual report of the PBGC, ERISA specifies "that the U.S. government is not liable for any obligation or liability incurred by PBGC." This point is critical, because if the PBGC fails, the workers whose pension it guarantees no longer have a guarantee.

Although the federal government does not stand behind the PBGC's obligations as explicitly stated under ERISA, an April 28, 2008, letter from the Congressional Budget Office to former congressman George Miller, then chair of the Committee on Education and Labor, stated that "an implicit expectation exists among many market participants and policymakers that taxpayers will ultimately pay for benefits should PBGC be unable to meet those obligations."8

To meet claims not covered by plan assets or obtained from terminated plan sponsors, no funding can be obtained from the federal government. This is because there are no appropriations from general revenues to cover any claims. Instead, funding sources are limited to investment returns, premiums received, and assets from terminated plans taken over by the PBGC. Premiums are set by Congress. In 1974, when the PBGC was established, the premium was set at  $1 per participant for single-employer plans and$ 0.50 per participant for multiemployer plans. The per-participant rate has been raised over time, and it has also been adjusted for the financial health of the plan as measured by the amount of underfunding of the vested plan.

The PBGC can best be described as an insurer with little control over key financial decisions that might permit it to increase the likelihood of accomplishing its overarching mandate. Under ERISA, its mission is to preserve the defined benefit plans it insures and to protect the beneficiaries of those plans. The agency's inability to employ strategies available to private insurers and the influence of political issues associated with decisions made by Congress make the management of the PBGC one of the most challenging tasks faced by any financial institution.

The PBGC has acknowledged that, based on its current funded status and investment policy, the probability is high that it will have insufficient funds to pay all future benefits due current beneficiaries. For this reason, a reasonable goal for the PBGC would be to maintain the program as long as possible with the hope of eventually putting as small a deficit as possible on the U.S. government should the government agree to bail it out.

Consequently, it is not a surprise that the GAO highlighted the PBGC as a "high-risk" agency in its report to the U.S. Congress starting in 2003. In its February 14, 2013, update, the GAO acknowledged the progress made by the PBGC and actions by Congress to address the agency's weaknesses. Nonetheless, the GAO concluded: "Because of long-term challenges related to PBGC's governance and funding structure, PBGC's financial future is uncertain."[9]

One obvious way to reduce the likelihood of receiving the assets of terminated pension plans is for the PBGC to require one or more of the following: larger contributions, higher premiums for underfunded plans, or lower guaranteed payments. But such risk mitigation policies are currently unavailable to the PGBC's management. Unlike for an insurer, the first two requirements can have an adverse impact on the viability of current plans covered by the PBGC, whereas the last is a politically sensitive issue. Instead, it seems that the best that can be done is to prepare for the terminated plans, working with the sponsors of troubled plans, and, in the case of bankruptcy, litigating to obtain recovery of additional assets. These practices are currently being pursued by the PBGC's management.

The value of the liabilities of a defined benefit plan can be measured in terms of the present value of the projected payments to the plan's beneficiaries. The value of the plan's assets is equal to the market value of these assets. When the value of the assets exceeds the value of the liabilities, the plan is said to have a surplus. In the opposite case, that is, when the value of the liabilities exceeds the value of the assets, the plan is said to have a deficit. Typically, as an indicator of the ability of a plan to satisfy its liabilities, the funding ratio is calculated.

The funding ratio is the ratio of the plan's assets to its liabilities and is the primary measure of the plan's financial health (i.e., ability to meet plan obligations). When there is a surplus, this means that the funding ratio exceeds  $100\%$ , and the plan is said to be overfunded. The higher the funding ratio, the healthier the plan is. Concern arises when there is a deficit and the funding ratio falls below  $100\%$ . The plan in that case is underfunded.

The management of a plan by a sponsor should focus on meeting the liabilities. This means designing an investment policy and asset allocation strategy to satisfy liabilities. As indicated earlier, one of the responsibilities of plan sponsor consultants is to work with the plan sponsor to develop an investment policy and asset allocation strategy among the major asset classes to satisfy those liabilities. Unfortunately, it was not until plans realized substantial underfunding (i.e., funding ratios considerably below  $100\%$ ) and huge deficits that there was acceptance of the major financial crisis that corporate defined pension plans faced. This crisis led to the passage on April 10, 2004, of the Pension Funding Equity Act, which gave corporate sponsors of defined benefit plans some "relief" from burdensome pension contributions and, as the 2004 act's summary stated, would "protect the retirement benefits of millions of American workers and help ensure that their pension benefits will be there when they retire." Unfortunately, the bandage placed on this major hemorrhage was not adequate. As Richard Ippolito, former chief economist of the PBGC, wrote after the passage of the 2004 act:

Unfortunately, Congress has failed to adequately address the problems of the PBGC. In temporary legislation passed in April 2004, Congress reduced the required contributions companies must make to their defined-benefit pension plans by an estimated  $80 billion over two years by changing the formula used to calculate pension liabilities. Congress also provided additional relief of approximately$ 1.6 billion to steel and airline companies with heavily underfunded pension plans.[10]

Congress subsequently modified and permanently extended the relief granted in the 2004 act with the passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.

The primary beneficiaries of these laws were the beneficiaries of plans sponsored by corporations in the steel and airlines industries. In fact, from 1975 to 2000, about  $75\%$  of the claims paid by the PBGC were made to employees in those two industries: Bethlehem Steel ( $3.9 billion), LTV Steel ($ 1.9 billion), National Steel ($1.1.3 billion), Pan American Airlines ($800 million), and Eastern Airlines (600 million). However, the pension problem goes beyond the steel and airlines industries. Examples of corporations with computed deficits based on December 31, 2003, accounting statements were Ford Motor, Allegheny Technologies, Goodyear, Navistar, Maytag, and Avon Products.[11] Moreover, the size of the deficit can be so large that it exceeds the value of the corporate sponsor.

Bernard Condon, writing in Forbes in August 2004, reported that although in 1999 more than half the companies in the S&P 500 had overfunded plans, only 51 were overfunded in 2004.[12] Moreover, based on pension fund accounting, which we describe later, strong arguments can be made that the number of pension funds identified as overfunded in 1999 might be far lower than was reported. To show the severity of the problem, Ippolito wrote in 2004:

Pension plan underfunding stands at more than 350 billion, which increases the likelihood that more pension plans will go under and taxpayers will eventually be called upon to provide a bailout.[13]

Some view this problem as the major financial crisis that the United States will face in future years and that will more than likely cause the phasing out of defined benefit plans in favor of defined contribution plans. Moreover, the same is also true for public-sector defined benefit plans. Although little had been mentioned in the press about the problems that state and local governments face until recently, the concern is the same. The question is: What caused this crisis?

Here we briefly present the reasons for the crisis. $^{14}$  However, the causes are not different from what we described with regard to the U.S. S&L crisis: poor regulatory supervision and poor asset/liability management. The additional contributing factor here is the inadequate accounting and actuarial treatment by the accounting and actuarial professions.

It is often denied by representatives of corporate plans and their consultants, but historically, the investment policy of plans focused on the growth of assets and not on the liability side. Plan sponsors made their asset allocation decisions among the major asset classes—common stock, bonds, real estate, and alternative assets—based on what was expected to be the better-performing assets, without consideration of the liabilities. Hence, during the period of rising equity prices in the 1990s, greater allocations were made to that asset class. Stock market returns in 1997 and 1998, for example, were  $33\%$  and  $28\%$ , respectively. Not only were plan sponsors not watching liabilities when evaluating the performance of the plan, but some accounting and actuarial rules allowed them to benefit from certain asset allocations.

To understand the root of the crisis, let's look at the liability side, so that we know how liabilities are valued. As just explained, the value of the liabilities is determined by the present value of the future liabilities. Simple enough, except when one asks what interest rate should be used to calculate the present value of the liabilities. The interest rate used to calculate any present value is called the discount rate. The basic property of the time value of money is that the lower the discount rate is, the higher the present value will be. When discussing the valuation of cash flows in later chapters, we will see another important property about the relationship between future cash flows and present value. Specifically, present value may be highly sensitive to the discount rate used. This sensitivity of the present value of cash flows is referred to as its duration. The duration measure applies to both assets and liabilities. It is not our purpose here to describe duration in any detail, but it is sufficient to understand its role in the pension crisis story by noting that duration is the approximate percentage change in the value of an asset or liability for a 100-basis-point change in the discount rate or interest rate. Typically, duration for a defined benefit plan is 15, so if pension liabilities are  $1 billion, as determined by using a discount rate of, say, 10\%$ , then if a discount rate of  $9\%$  is used instead, the liabilities will increase by  $15\%$ , to 150 million. Such a small change in the discount rate leads to a significant change in the value of the liabilities! Therefore, the question of who gets to establish the discount rate that is used for computing the liabilities is important.

The answer to that question is that the rules for pension accounting for financial reporting purposes allow the plan sponsor to determine it in conjunction with actuaries. Basically, the sponsor should be using a discount rate that reflects the rate of return on assets that it can reasonably be expected to earn on the plan's assets in the future. This discount rate is referred to accordingly as the return on assets. Determining the return on assets is highly subjective in determining the economic well-being of the plan, yet the choice (subject to some guidelines) is left with the plan sponsor. In 2001, for example, the investor Warren Buffett had this to say about this aspect of pension accounting:

Unfortunately, the subject of pension [return] assumptions, critically important though it is, almost never comes up in corporate board meetings…. And now, of course, the need for discussion is paramount because these assumptions that are being made, with all eyes looking backward at the glories of the 1990s, are so extreme. I invite you to ask the CFO of a company having a large defined-benefit pension fund what adjustment would need to be made to the company's earnings if its pension assumption was lowered to 6.5 percent. And then, if you want to be mean, ask what the company's assumptions were back in 1975 when both stocks and bonds had far higher prospective returns than they do now.[15]

Buffett goes on to warn that too high a return on assets risks litigation for a company's chief investment officer, its board, and its auditors. Yet overestimating return on assets is a hard-to-resist temptation, because it produces a lower value for the liabilities and a higher funding ratio (i.e., a seemingly healthier pension plan).[16]

We now have the background for understanding the pension crisis. In the 1990s, pension funds allocated more to common stock than to bonds, for the reason described earlier. Starting in 2000, two conditions in the financial markets moved against pension funds. First, the stock market declined, which had a significant impact on the value of plan assets. Second, the return on assets assumptions made by plan sponsors came under closer scrutiny. Interest rates had declined, and with a dismal outlook for the stock market, the return on assets assumption was lowered. The result was deterioration in funding ratios. In fact, some still argue that the return on assets assumptions that plan sponsors have adopted subsequently are still too aggressive and that if the liabilities of pension plans were assessed properly, funding ratios would be considerably lower.

To see how the selection of the return on assets trickles down to distort the plan sponsor's corporate earnings, consider the evidence provided by two Wall Street analysts, David Zion and Bill Carcache.[17] They estimated that if the accounting treatment required by accounting rules were replaced by what actually happened to the pension plans, the aggregate reported earnings for companies in the S&P 500 would have been reduced by  $69\%$  in 2001 and by  $10\%$  in 2000. Thirty companies would have seen a decline in earnings in excess of $1 billion, with seven companies seeing a decline of more than $5 billion.

Problems with U.S. Public-Sector Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Our discussion of the problems faced in the private sector for defined benefit plans also applies to the public sector. Defined benefit plans are far more common than defined contribution plans in this sector for the reasons noted in the chapter. As with private sector plans, these plans have been characterized by poor asset management, a failure to understand how to assess performance, and overly optimistic assumptions about asset returns. These problems have resulted in considerable underfunding of public-sector defined benefit plans. The "Milliman 2012 Public Pension Fund Study" found that for the 100 largest public-sector defined benefit plans, underfunding was 895 billion, with a funding ratio of 75.1\%. The rate of return on assets assumed in this calculation was 7.65\%.

State and local governments have sought to deal with the underfunding problems in several ways.[19] First, some sponsors have issued new bonds with the sole purpose of refinancing current liabilities. This tactic has not proved to be satisfactory in dealing with the long-term problem faced by public-sector defined benefit plans. Second, the modification and the adoption of new types of defined benefit plans by state and local governments do nothing to reduce underfunding but instead add new risks for taxpayers. Finally, encouraging employees' early retirement does not deal adequately with the problem and is typically a costly solution.

In light of the failure of the so-called reforms that have been pursued by state and local governments, a call has been made for public-sector pension reform by freezing defined benefit plans and shifting to defined contribution plans, as has been done in the private sector. However, it should be remembered that despite the problems faced by the PBGC, there is no equivalent insurer for public-sector defined benefit plans.
