After reading this chapter, you will understand:

- the importance of credit ratings in the financial market;
- what a credit rating agency (CRA) is and what a nationally recognized statistical rating organization is;
- regulation of CRAs;
- the different credit rating systems of the three major rating companies;
- the difference between investment-grade bonds and noninvestment-grade (or high-yield) debt;
- what a rating transition matrix is;
- how regulators use credit ratings;
- what the nonregulatory uses of credit ratings are;
- the issuer-pay system for compensating CRAs and the potential conflicts that can arise;
- the concern about the overreliance of ratings by market participants; and
- factors considered in the rating of sovereign government debt, corporate bonds, and U.S. municipal bonds.

A major risk in the financial system is default risk, which is one form of credit risk. Default risk is the risk that the obligor will fail to satisfy the terms of the lending agreement. This would involve failing to make the contractual interest payments and the scheduled repayment of principal on a timely basis. Investors who do not have access to their own credit analysis staff use, to different degrees, opinions about default risk as provided by companies that perform credit analysis and cast their opinion in the form of a rating, referred to as a credit rating. These commercial rating companies are referred to as credit rating agencies (CRAs). Although the term "agencies" might suggest that they are somehow government-affiliated or government-related entities, they are not.

In this chapter, we look CRAs, their role in financial markets, their credit rating systems, the factors that they consider when assigning a credit rating, and the controversies associated with CRAs in the performance of what is expected of them.

# The Role of CRAs in the Financial System

CRA ratings provide a critical function in the financial system by reducing information asymmetry in the market for debt obligations and private contracts. This role of CRAs has fostered the development of debt markets throughout the world, improving market efficiency and allowing a reliable interest rate structure that can be used for determining compensation for exposure to different degrees of default risk.

The notion of information asymmetry is important to understanding how efficiently capital markets operate, so we'll start with a brief explanation. In a two-party transaction, one party may have more information than the other party. For example, in the sale of a used car, the seller has more information about the car's condition that affects its value than the potential buyer does. In the case of a debt obligation, at the time of issuance, information asymmetry exists because the issuer (i.e., the seller of the security) knows more about the creditworthiness of the debt obligation than does the buyer (i.e., the investor). Creditworthiness is not directly observable and therefore requires that the buyer acquire information about this attribute of a debt obligation. Buyers can do this by (1) performing their own analysis of creditworthiness based on information obtained from the issuer, (2) retaining the services of a third party to provide an assessment of the creditworthiness of a debt obligation, or (3) using ratings that a CRA provides to the public. The difference between the second and third alternatives is that the third party provides a private evaluation, whereas a CRA evaluation is available to the public and does not require that a fee be paid by the buyer. Instead, the issuer pays a fee, a practice that has raised the problem of a potential conflict of interest, as discussed later in this chapter.

# CRAs and Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations in the United States

Because CRAs play a critical role in credit markets by performing credit analysis on entities issuing securities or private contracts, in the United States, entities that have been recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to assign ratings are referred to as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). For an entity seeking to be classified as an NRSRO, the SEC's Office of Credit Ratings (created in 2006 by the Credit Rating Reform Act) reviews the entity's position in the market and operational capability. With respect to position in the market, the focus is on whether the entity is nationally recognized. For operational capability, the SEC looks at organizational structure, rating procedure and methodology, financial resources sufficient to maintain independence of the entities it rates, the size and quality of the staff, and independence from the companies that it rates. In addition to its role in the registration of NRSROs, the Office of Credit Ratings monitors the activities and performs periodic examinations of registered NRSROs.

When a CRA applies to the SEC for NRSRO status, it becomes registered with respect to one or more of the following five categories of ratings: (1) financial institutions, brokers, or dealers; (2) insurance companies; (3) corporate issuers; (4) issuers of asset-backed securities; and (5) issuers of government securities, municipal securities, or securities issued by a foreign government. The 10 CRAs registered as NRSROs as of December 2015 and the date of their initial registration are

# European Regulation of CRAs

CRAs did not perform well in assigning ratings to structured finance products such as subprime mortgage-backed securities. More specifically, these products, which had been awarded the highest credit rating, exhibited poor credit performance. In 2007 and 2008, this systematic overrating led to the collapse of the subprime mortgage-backed securities market and had a ripple effect on global credit markets and the global economy. Another concern was the downgrading of sovereign government debt of certain countries in the eurozone, which some market observers viewed as unjustified. As a result of the global credit crisis and the downgrading of certain sovereign debt, European regulators sought measures to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework for CRAs when operating in the European Union.

To so do, the following rules were established by the European Union. First, a regulatory framework and oversight structure was introduced in 2009. More specifically, registration of CRAs was required, they had to provide a sound methodological basis for deriving ratings that had to be transparent to market participants, and they were required to avoid conflicts of interest. When the European Securities and Market Authority was created in 2011, CRAs had to register with this entity, which then regulated the registered CRAs. To deal with regulator concerns about sovereign ratings, in 2013, the rules were amended to address what were perceived to be weaknesses with the CRA rating methodology.

Later in this chapter, we will discuss a major concern with credit ratings: the overreliance of investors on ratings. We will also discuss a major problem with CRAs: conflicts of interest in assigning ratings. The regulations of the European Securities and Market Authority seek to reduce overreliance on credit ratings and potential conflicts of interests of CRAs. In addition, the regulations seek to make the credit rating process more transparent, improve the reliability of ratings, and encourage more entities to participate in the credit rating business.

# Credit Rating Systems

Each CRA assigns a rating to the entity or financial instrument being rated. The three major CRAs are Moody's, S&P, and Fitch. The rating systems used by these three rating companies are shown in table 5.1, along with a brief description of each rating.

Table 5.1 Summary of corporate bond ratings systems investment grade: high creditworthiness.

<table><tr><td>Moody&#x27;s</td><td>S&amp;P</td><td>Fitch</td><td>Brief Definition</td></tr><tr><td>Aaa</td><td>AAA</td><td>AAA</td><td>Gilt edge, prime, maximum safety</td></tr><tr><td>Aa1</td><td>AA+</td><td>AA+</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Aa2</td><td>AA</td><td>AA</td><td>Very high grade, high quality</td></tr><tr><td>Aa3</td><td>AA-</td><td>AA-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A1</td><td>A+</td><td>A+</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A2</td><td>A</td><td>A</td><td>Upper medium grade</td></tr><tr><td>A3</td><td>A-</td><td>A-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Baa1</td><td>BBB+</td><td>BBB+</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Baa2</td><td>BBB</td><td>BBB</td><td>Lower medium grade</td></tr><tr><td>Baa3</td><td>BBB-</td><td>BBB-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ba1</td><td>BB+</td><td>BB+</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ba2</td><td>BB</td><td>BB</td><td>Low grade, speculative</td></tr><tr><td>Ba3</td><td>BB-</td><td>BB-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B1</td><td>B+</td><td>B+</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B2</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>Highly speculative</td></tr><tr><td>B3</td><td>B-</td><td>B-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CCC+</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Caa</td><td>CCC</td><td>CCC</td><td>Substantial risk, in poor standing</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CCC-</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ca</td><td>CC</td><td>CC</td><td>May be in default, extremely speculative</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>Even more speculative than those above</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CI</td><td></td><td>CI = Income bonds; no interest is being paid</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>DDD</td><td>Default</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>DD</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td></td></tr></table>

In all three systems, the term high grade means low default risk; that is, there is a high probability of future payments. Moody's uses the symbol Aaa to designate the highest-grade debt obligations, but the other two major CRAs use AAA. The next highest grade is Aa (Moody's) or AA (S&P and Fitch). All CRAs use the symbol A to denote the third grade. The next three grades are Baa or BBB, Ba or BB, and B, respectively. There are also C grades. S&P and Fitch use plus or minus signs to provide a narrower credit quality breakdown within each class, and Moody's uses 1, 2, or 3 for the same purpose. These refinements in the ratings are referred to as rating "notches."

Debt obligations rated triple A (AAA or Aaa) are said to be prime; double A (AA or Aa) are of high quality; single A issues are referred to as upper medium grade, and triple B are medium grade. Lower-rated debt issues are said to have speculative elements or to be distinctly speculative.

If a debt obligation has a rating in the top four categories, it is said to be investment grade. When a debt obligation is assigned a rating below the top four categories, it is said to be noninvestment grade or more popularly referred to as high-yield debt or, unfortunately, misnamed a junk debt. Thus, the debt market can be divided into two sectors based on credit ratings: the investment-grade market and the noninvestment-grade market. This distinction is important, because investment guidelines of institutional investors may prohibit the purchase of noninvestment-grade debt obligations.

If a rated entity receives a different rating from two or more CRAs, the rating is said to be a split rating. For example, Moody's might assign a particular bond issue a AA rating, whereas S&P might assign the same issue an A rating.

After the initial rating is assigned, a CRA monitors the debt obligation or issuer. A CRA may announce that it is reviewing a particular credit rating, and it may go further and state that the outcome of the review may result in a downgrade (i.e., a lower credit rating being assigned) or an upgrade (i.e., a higher credit rating being assigned). The risk that there will be a change in a credit rating that results in a lower rating is referred to as downgrade risk. When this announcement is made by a rating agency, the issue or issuer is said to be under credit watch.

In addition, to help market participants make credit decisions, for certain types of debt instruments, the CRAs provide information for assessing potential rating downgrades and upgrades. They do so by periodically publishing a rating transition matrix or rating migration matrix. These tables are available for different transition periods (e.g., one year or five years).

Table 5.2 shows a portion of a hypothetical average one-year transition matrix for corporate bonds. In the table, the first row shows the start-of-the-year rating, and the first column shows the end-of-year rating. Look at the cell where the rating at the beginning of the year is A1 and the rating at the end of the year is A1. This cell represents the percentage of issues rated A1 at the beginning of the year that did not change their rating over the year, that is, experienced no downgrades or upgrades. As can be seen,  $75.80\%$  of the issues rated A1 at the start of the year were rated A1 at the end of the year.

Table 5.2 A hypothetical average one-year rating migration table.

<table><tr><td>From/To</td><td>Aaa</td><td>Aa1</td><td>…</td><td>A1</td><td>A2</td><td>A3</td><td>Baa1…</td><td>B1</td><td>B2</td><td>…</td><td>Ca-C</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Aaa</td><td>87</td><td>6.15</td><td>…</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.01</td><td>…</td><td>0.01</td><td>0</td><td>…</td><td>0</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>Aa1</td><td>2</td><td>74.9</td><td>…</td><td>1.6</td><td>0.53</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.17</td><td>…</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>…</td><td>0</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>A1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.24</td><td>…</td><td>75.8</td><td>8.08</td><td>2.91</td><td>0.69</td><td>…</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.02</td><td>…</td><td>0</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>A2</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.04</td><td>…</td><td>5.24</td><td>76.11</td><td>5.99</td><td>2.87</td><td>…</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.04</td><td>…</td><td>0</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>A3</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.06</td><td>…</td><td>1.89</td><td>6.71</td><td>73.41</td><td>6.76</td><td>…</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.05</td><td>…</td><td>0.01</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>Baa1</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.04</td><td>…</td><td>0.26</td><td>1.83</td><td>6.8</td><td>72.55</td><td>…</td><td>0.38</td><td>0.07</td><td>…</td><td>0.02</td><td>…</td></tr></table>

Note: The top row is the starting rating; the first column is the rating at the end of one year.

Now look at the cell where the rating at the beginning of the year is A1 and at the end of the year is A3. This shows the percentage of issues rated A1 at the beginning of the year that were downgraded to A3 by the end of the year,  $2.91\%$ . One can interpret this figure as a probability. In our example, it is the probability that an issue rated A1 will be downgraded to A3 by the end of the year. A rating transition matrix also shows the potential for upgrades. Again, in table 5.3, issues rated A2 at the beginning of the year have a  $5.24\%$  chance of being upgraded to A1 at the end of the year.

# Use of Ratings by Regulators

Because of the perceived importance of the need for third-party credit analysis, U.S. regulators began to incorporate rating requirements for financial regulatory purposes in 1931. In that year, the Fed and another banking regulator, the Comptroller of the Currency, required that banks use ratings for distinguishing between investment-grade and noninvestment-grade bonds. For all bonds rated noninvestment grade, banks had to report their holdings in terms of market value, which was not the case for investment-grade bonds, where the holdings were reported in terms of the purchase price. The Fed and the Comptroller of the Currency, along with yet another banking regulator, the FDIC, banned the purchase of noninvestment-grade bonds by banks in 1936. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners used ratings for determining capital reserve requirements. Specifically, in 1951, insurers who invested in lower-rated bonds had higher capital reserve requirements imposed.

The term "NRSRO" was adopted in 1975 so that the SEC could determine how much capital brokerage firms and dealer firms must hold for different grades of debt instruments on their balance sheets. This requirement led to greater reliance on NRSROs to define creditworthiness in federal and state regulations. For example, when establishing the appropriate investments in which insurance companies may invest, several state insurance codes rely to different degrees on the ratings of NRSROs.[6]

The U.S. Congress relied on credit ratings when defining such terms as a "mortgage-related security." The Secondary Market Enhancement Act of 1984 stipulated that mortgage-related securities be rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the CRAs. Credit ratings were employed by the U.S. Department of Education for setting financial responsibility standards for entities that wished to participate in student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. With greater use of credit ratings by the U.S. Congress in lawmaking and by regulators in monitoring financial institutions, institutional investors adopted ratings in their investment guidelines and mandates for both internal and external managers. Registered investment companies incorporated them into their prospectuses. For example, the SEC's Rule 2a-7 for money market funds, which we discuss in chapter 32, prohibits investment in certain types of securities if they do not have a credit rating.

# Nonregulatory Use of Ratings

In addition to regulators' use of credit ratings, four other market participants benefit from the existence of ratings: issuers, asset management firms, brokerage firms and dealers, and transactors in private contracts.

Issuers of debt obligations typically must have at least one rating to market their securities. This is because investors, by investment guidelines or regulation, set forth permissible investments in terms of NRSRO ratings.

When an entity issues a security, the yield at which it has to offer the security to the public is the cost of its funds. As explained in chapter 23, the higher the rating is, the lower the funding cost will be.

In chapter 3, we discussed asset management firms. These firms receive mandates from clients. For example (and what is relevant here), some firms have accounts in which they can invest only in debt obligations that receive a certain rating. For example, there are client funds that can be invested only in investment-grade bonds, whereas others can invest primarily in noninvestment-grade bonds. The investment guidelines that an asset management firm must comply with in managing client funds dictate the permissible credit-rated debt obligations. Asset management firms typically have a credit analysis group that performs independent research to analyze the issuer's creditworthiness. Typically the credit analysis group will use ratings as a screen to determine eligible debt obligations in which the firm can invest. As discussed later in this chapter, a major concern for regulators is that investors might rely too much on these ratings.

Brokerage firms and dealers utilize ratings in several ways. First, when offering debt instruments to clients (asset management firms and retail investors), they make sure that the securities offered are consistent with a buyer's investment guidelines. Second, when acting in their capacity as investment advisers for issuers of debt obligations, they discuss with their clients which CRAs to obtain a rating from. Third, as explained earlier, securities firms are required to use ratings for determining net capital requirements, which is the reason the SEC created the NRSRO designation for qualified CRAs.

Finally, private contracts can arise in the financial market between two parties. The most common example is the over-the-counter derivative contract. Ratings are used to determine acceptable counterparties. Brokerage firms and dealers determine the minimum rating for a counterparty using investment guidelines and, where applicable, regulatory requirements.

# Concerns Regarding CRAs

Ratings are opinions and not guarantees. So it is not surprising that defaults have occurred despite a debt issue initially receiving a high investment-grade rating. However, some of the miscues by CRAs in the past suggested to regulators that greater oversight of CRAs was in order. In the 1980s, for example, new, legally untested bond structures were introduced into the U.S. municipal bond market. The best-known example is the Washington Public Supply System's revenue bonds (nicknamed "Whoops" bonds), issued for five nuclear power plants (Projects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) in 1980. S&P and Moody's rated the bonds for Projects 1, 2, and 3 triple A and the bonds for Projects 4 and 5 A- (by Moody's) and A+ (by S&P). Only one of the nuclear power plants was completed, the issuer defaulting on 2.5 billion, the largest municipal bond default at the time. In 1994, Orange County, California, defaulted on bonds it had issued that had been rated AA/Aa by both Moody's and S&P, leading to the bankruptcy filing of that county. At the time, it was the largest bankruptcy of a municipality in U.S. history.

In the 1990s, alternatives were considered by the SEC with respect to how to deal with the use of NRSRO ratings when implementing rules set forth by the SEC and the designation of entities as NRSROs. Basically, the SEC decided to continue the use of NRSRO ratings and the designation of NRSROs. The alternatives that the SEC considered were (1) eliminating reliance on NRSRO ratings and not designating an NRSRO and (2) putting into place more direct and expanded oversight of CRAs. In 1997, the SEC sought comments from market participants for the attributes of a rating organization to qualify as an NRSRO and also set forth a formal application process for a rating organization seeking NRSRO status. Three other issues for which comments were solicited by the SEC were whether to (1) prohibit an NRSRO from charging issuers a fee based on the issuance size of a transaction (because of concern that a size-based fee would compromise an NRSRO's objectivity); (2) mandate that an NRSRO make its ratings generally available to the public, not just to its subscribers; and (3) substitute under certain circumstances statistical models of default risk for ratings. The SEC did not act on these issues at that time.

The major concerns and increased awareness of the ratings assigned by CRAs began in the early 2000s as a result of the well-publicized bankruptcies of major corporations that were initially highly rated. The first was Enron Corporation, whose bonds carried an investment-grade rating just days before it filed for bankruptcy in 2001—the biggest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. In 2002, there was the bankruptcy of WorldCom. Its bonds were rated investment grade three months prior to its bankruptcy filing. In March 2002, the bonds of Global Crossing were rated investment grade; in July 2002, it defaulted on its loans. There were California utilities that were rated A—two weeks prior to defaulting. The bonds of AT&T Canada carried an investment-grade rating in February 2002; the company defaulted in September 2002.

As a result of the Enron bankruptcy in 2001, Congress reviewed the issues relating to CRAs. Two hearings were held in 2002 (January and March) by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. The March 20 hearing, titled "Rating the Raters: Enron and the Credit Rating Agencies,"[7] focused specifically on the role of CRAs in the Enron bankruptcy. Testimony by one prominent legal expert argued that Congress should instruct regulatory authorities to discard the use of ratings, because ratings failed to provide useful or timely information about an issuer's creditworthiness. The conclusion of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs' staff report, titled *Financial Oversight* of Enron: The SEC and Private-Sector Watchdogs,[8] concluded that the CRAs exhibited a disappointing lack of diligence in their credit analysis of Enron.

More recently, attacks on the performance of ratings assigned by CRAs to structured products leading up to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis have raised further concerns in the United States and other major countries. The focus of the investigations both in the United States and in Europe has been on two issues. The first is the influence of the issuer on the ratings assigned to securities that it issues. The second is investors' overreliance or exclusive reliance on ratings.

# Influence of the Issuer on Ratings

When the credit rating business started, users/investors of ratings would pay the CRA. That is, the compensation was a user-pay model. The ratings were published monthly, and subscribers paid for the books. Enter that great innovation in the 1970s: the photocopier. Because all or portions of the ratings book could be copied and distributed, the user-pay model was no longer feasible for CRAs as a business model. To survive, the CRAs shifted from a user-pay model to issuer-pay model, wherein the payment for the assignment of a rating became the responsibility of the issuer. Although an issuer could refuse to obtain any rating, typically, they would obtain at least one rating from one of the CRAs, because it would be difficult to issue a debt obligation without a rating. But the issuer-pay model can result in a potential for conflicts of interest, which calls into question the objectivity of ratings. More specifically, it has been argued that issuers will select a CRA from which it can obtain the highest possible rating, and that, in an attempt to attract issuers, a CRA will compromise its rating criteria to the benefit of the issuer.

This potential conflict of interest has given rise to the rating shopping hypothesis about the behavior of issuers in their dealings with CRA. This hypothesis asserts that an issuer will search (i.e., shop) among the CRAs for the one that provides the best credit rating. Another form of the rating shopping hypothesis relates to shopping for as many ratings as possible, even if it is at the same rating level. Moreover, there is a concern that when monitoring issuers that it has rated, a CRA may be hesitant to downgrade the debt of those issuers because in the future, downgraded issuers may be reluctant to have new debt rated by that CRA.

The counterargument is that CRAs have a strong "incentive to build and protect their reputations for being independent and objective."[10] A CRA's success in the marketplace depends in large part on the reputational capital that it builds, because the issuers will not continue to pay for ratings from a CRA that investors believe may have been biased in the past. Thus, a CRA's reputation for issuing honest and objective ratings is perhaps its greatest marketable asset, and reputational incentives to issue objective ratings are a strong countervailing force acting against any potential conflict of interest engendered by the issuer-pay model. In fact, an empirical study conducted by two members of the Federal Reserve Board found "no evidence consistent with rating agencies acting in the interests of issuers due to a conflict of interest" and that "instead, rating agencies appear to be relatively responsive to reputation concerns and so protect the interests of investors."[11]

The increased adoption by regulators and market participants elevated the role of ratings. It has been argued that the unintended consequence is the overreliance on ratings by investors, asset managers, and regulators. There is growing concern that investors, particularly institutional investors, rely on ratings without performing their own credit analysis and that herd behavior results from relying solely on ratings. A report by the SEC acknowledged the growing dependence on ratings by investors and regulators not only for public debt offerings but also for private debt arrangements. For example, ratings are used in determining collateral requirements by counterparties for non-exchange traded derivatives and by dealers in lending transactions. Two studies suggest that overreliance on the ratings of emerging market sovereign bonds was a destabilizing factor in the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis.[12]

In April 2008, a report by the Financial Stability Forum states: "Investors should address their over-reliance on ratings. Investor associations should consider developing standards of due diligence and credit analysis for investing in structured products."13 In response, in late 2008, such industry associations as the European Fund and Asset Management Association, the European Securitization Forum, and the Investment Management Association prepared industry guidelines to address the issue of overreliance on ratings for securitized products.

Proposals both in the United States and in Europe have sought to reverse the alleged overreliance or sole reliance on ratings. Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act resulted in the SEC "adopting amendments today to remove references to credit ratings in rules and forms promulgated under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act."[14] The SEC stated:

While we recognize that credit ratings play a significant role in the investment decisions of many investors, we want to avoid using credit ratings in a manner that suggests in any way a "seal of approval" on the quality of any particular credit rating or rating agency, including any nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO"). Similarly, the legislative history indicates that Congress, in adopting Section 939A, intended to "reduce reliance on credit ratings."

A similar tack has been taken for banks in the eurozone. In July 2011, the European Commission's internal markets commissioner, Michel Barnier, stated in a speech to the European Securities and Markets Authority, "To limit overreliance, we will be strengthening the requirement for banks to carry out their own analysis of risk and not rely on external ratings in an automatic and mechanical way. $^{15}$

# Factors Considered When Assigning Ratings

As discussed earlier in the chapter, CRAs rate a wide range of debt obligations by different issuers. Here we briefly describe the factors that they consider when rating the debt of sovereign governments, corporations, and U.S. state and local governments. All CRAs consider the same factors. They differ as to what weight they assign to each factor when determining their final rating.

Sovereign Government Debt

Sovereign debt is the obligation of a country's central government. For the reasons discussed subsequently, two sovereign debt ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies, a local currency debt rating and a foreign currency debt rating.

The three major CRAs all assign ratings to sovereign bonds. The two general categories of risk analyzed when assigning ratings are economic risk and political risk. The former category is an assessment of the ability of a government to satisfy its obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses are used to assess economic risk.

Political risk is an assessment of the willingness of a government to satisfy its obligations. A government might be able to pay but unwilling to do so. Political risk is assessed based on qualitative analysis of the economic and political factors that influence a government's economic policies.

The reason for distinguishing between local debt ratings and foreign currency debt ratings is that historically, the default frequency differs by the currency denomination of the debt. Specifically, defaults have been greater on foreign currency-denominated debt. The reason for the difference in default rates for local currency debt and foreign currency debt is that if a government is willing to raise taxes and control its domestic financial system, it can generate sufficient local currency to meet its local currency debt obligation. This is not the case with foreign currency-denominated debt. A national government must purchase foreign currency to meet a debt obligation in that foreign currency and therefore has less control with respect to its exchange rate. Thus, a significant depreciation of the local currency relative to a foreign currency in which a debt obligation is denominated will impair a national government's ability to satisfy such obligations.

The implication is that the factors analyzed to assess the creditworthiness of a national government's local currency debt and foreign currency debt will differ to some extent. When assessing the credit quality of local currency debt, for example, S&P emphasizes domestic government policies that foster or impede timely debt service. For foreign currency debt, credit analysis by S&P focuses on the interaction of domestic and foreign government policies. S&P analyzes a country's balance of payments and the structure of its external balance sheet. The areas of analysis with respect to its external balance sheet are the net public debt, total net external debt, and net external liabilities.

# Corporate Debt

To assess the default risk of a corporate issuer or a corporate debt obligation, CRAs generally look at three areas: (1) the protections afforded to debtholders that are provided by covenants limiting management's discretion, (2) the collateral available to the debtholder should the issuer fail to make the required payments, and (3) the ability of an issuer to make the contractual payments to debtholders.

There are covenants imposed on management. Covenants establish rules for several important areas of operation for corporate management. These provisions are safeguards for the debtholder. Indenture provisions are analyzed carefully when assigning a rating to a bond or loan. When assessing the ability of an issuer to service its debt (i.e., make timely payments of interest and principal), the ability of an issuer to generate cash flow goes considerably beyond the analysis of the myriad financial ratios and cash flow measures that can be used as a basic assessment of a company's financial risk. CRAs also look at qualitative factors, such as the issuer's business risk and corporate governance risk, to assess the issuer's ability to pay.

Business risk is the risk associated with generating operating cash flows. Operating cash flows are uncertain, because the revenues and the expenditures composing the cash flows are uncertain. Revenues depend on conditions in the economy as a whole and in the industry in which the company operates, as well as on the actions of management and its competitors. To assess business risk, the three major CRAs look at the same general areas. S&P states that when analyzing business risk, it considers country risk, industry characteristics, company position, product portfolio/marketing, technology, cost efficiency, strategic and operational management competence, and profitability/peer group comparisons.[16] Moody's investigates industry trends, national political and regulatory environment, management quality and attitude toward risk taking, and basic operating and competitive position.[17] Fitch reviews industry trends, operating environment, market position, and management.[18]

Corporate governance issues have to do with (1) the ownership structure of the corporation, (2) the practices followed by management, and (3) policies for financial disclosure. The eagerness of corporate management to present favorable results to shareholders and the market has been a major factor in several of the corporate scandals in recent years and is what is referred to as corporate governance risk. Chief executive officers, chief financial officers, and the board of directors are being held directly accountable for disclosures in financial statements and other corporate decisions. Certain mechanisms can mitigate the likelihood that management will act in its own self-interest. These mechanisms fall into two general categories. In the first category are mechanisms that more strongly align the interests of management with those of shareholders. Such an alignment can be accomplished by granting management an economically meaningful equity interest in the company. Also, manager compensation can be linked to the performance of the company's common stock.

In the second category are the company's internal corporate control systems, which can provide a way to effectively monitor the performance and decision-making behavior of management.

In addition to corporate governance, CRAs look at the quality of management when assessing a corporation's ability to pay. To assess management quality, Moody's examines the business strategies and policies formulated by management. The factors Moody's considers are strategic direction, financial philosophy, conservatism, track record, succession planning, and control systems.

Having achieved an understanding of a corporation's business risk and corporate governance risk, the CRAs move on to assessing financial risk. The analysis involves traditional ratio analysis and other factors affecting the firm's financing. These measures, which are described in most books on investment management, address interest coverage, leverage, cash flow, net assets, and working capital. Once these measures are calculated for the firm being analyzed, CRAs compare them with similar measures for other firms in the same industry.

# U.S. Municipal Debt

The market for subgovernment debt is the subject of chapter 21. We'll describe here the factors that CRAs consider when assigning ratings to subnational entities in the United States, more specifically, the debt of state and local governments. As explained in chapter 21, there are two basic types of municipal security structures: tax-backed debt and revenue bonds. Tax-backed debt obligations are some form of tax revenue. The common type of tax-backed debt is a general obligation debt. The second basic type of security structure is found in a revenue bond. Such bonds are issued for either project or enterprise financings where the bond issuers pledge to the bondholders the revenues generated by the operating projects being financed. Examples include airport revenue bonds, college and university revenue bonds, hospital revenue bonds, single-family mortgage revenue bonds, multifamily revenue bonds, public power revenue bonds, resource recovery revenue bonds, toll road and gas tax revenue bonds, and water revenue bonds.

To evaluate tax-backed debt, the CRAs assess information in four basic categories. The first category includes information on the issuer's debt structure and overall debt burden. The second category relates to the issuer's ability and political discipline to maintain sound budgetary policy. The focus of attention here is usually on the issuer's general operating funds and whether the issuer has maintained balanced budgets over three to five years. The third category involves the specific local taxes and intergovernmental revenues available to the issuer, as well as historical information on both tax collection rates (which are important when looking at property tax levies) and the dependence of local budgets on specific revenue sources. The last category of information necessary for the credit analysis is an assessment of the issuer's overall socioeconomic environment. The determinations to be made for this category include trends of local employment distribution and composition, population growth, real estate property valuation, and personal income, among other economic factors.

Although numerous security structures can be used for revenue bonds, the key factor in rating such debt is whether the project being financed will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy the obligation to bondholders. The analysis is comparable to the factors considered when rating corporate debt.

# Key Points
- Credit rating agencies (CRAs) play a critical role in credit markets by performing credit analysis on entities issuing securities or private contracts and casting their opinions in the form of a credit rating.
- CRAs reduce information asymmetry in the market for debt obligations and private contracts.
- CRAs recognized by the SEC are classified as nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSROs).
- The three major CRAs are Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's Rating Services, and Fitch Ratings.
- In terms of credit rating, the debt market is divided into two sectors: the investment-grade market and the noninvestment-grade market.
- A debt obligation is investment grade if its ratings are in the top four rating categories.
- A debt obligation assigned a rating below the top four categories is said to be noninvestment grade, or more popularly referred to as high-yield debt.
- The compensation system for assigning ratings has shifted from a user-pay system to an issuer-pay system.
- A major concern with the issuer-pay system is that it may result in conflicts of interest, because it can result in rating shopping and the reluctance of a CRA to downgrade an issuer.
- Because of the importance placed on credit ratings by regulators, a major concern is that investors overrely or exclusively rely on ratings rather than performing their own credit analysis.
- Sovereign debt, the obligation of a country's central government, is assigned two credit ratings, a local currency debt rating and a foreign currency debt rating, because historically, the default frequency differs according to the currency denomination of the debt.
- The CRAs analyze both quantitative and qualitative factors when assessing the economic risk and political risk of sovereign debt issues.
- When assigning a credit rating to corporate debt, the CRAs assess the protections set forth in the loan agreement, the collateral available for the debtholders should the issuer fail to make the required payments, and the capacity of the issuer to fulfill its payment obligations.
- When assessing the ability of a corporate issuer to service its debt, CRAs assess the issuer's business risk, corporate governance risk, and financial risk.
- When assessing business risk (the risk associated with operating cash flows), some of the main factors considered are industry characteristics and trends, the company's market and competitive positions, management characteristics, and the national political and regulatory environment.
- Assessing corporate governance risk involves assessing (1) the ownership structure of the corporation, (2) the practices followed by management, and (3) policies for financial disclosure.
- Assessing corporate financial risk involves traditional ratio analysis and valuation of other factors affecting the firm's financing.
- To assess the debt of municipal issuers in the United States, a different type of credit evaluation is used for tax-backed debt and revenue-backed debt.
- Four basic categories are analyzed when assigning a credit rating to tax-backed debt: (1) the issuer's debt structure and overall debt burden, (2) the issuer's ability and political discipline to maintain sound budgetary policy,

(3) the specific local taxes and intergovernmental revenues available to the issuer, and (4) the issuer's overall socioeconomic environment.

- For revenue bonds, the key factor in rating such debt is whether the project being financed will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy the obligation due bondholders.

During the past 30 years, regulators, including the Commission, have increasingly used credit ratings to help monitor the risk of investments held by regulated entities, and to provide an appropriate disclosure framework for securities of differing risks.[19]

Give at least two examples of how regulators have used credit ratings to do the stipulated activities.
