Depository institutions include commercial banks (or simply, "banks") and thrifts (savings associations and credit unions). These financial intermediaries accept deposits. Deposits represent the liabilities (debt) of the deposit-accepting institution. With the funds raised through deposits and other funding sources, depository institutions make direct loans to various entities and also invest in securities. Their income is derived from two sources: the income generated from the loans they make and the securities they purchase, and fee income.

Depository institutions are highly regulated because of the important role they play in the financial system. Deposit accounts at banks are the principal means by which individuals and business entities make payments. In all countries, banks are subject to government regulation that imposes specific requirements, restrictions, and guidelines. The basis for bank regulations are (1) licensing and supervision (the need to have a license to engage in the banking business), (2) minimum requirements (the most important of which is bank minimum capital requirements), and (3) market discipline (banks must disclose financial and other information to depositors and other creditors).

Governments implement monetary policy through their banking system. Because of their important role, depository institutions are afforded special privileges, such as access to some form of deposit insurance and access to a government entity that provides funds for liquidity for emergency needs. An important global banking practice is deposit insurance, which is practiced in many countries to protect bank depositors from losses resulting from a bank's inability to honor withdrawals. The International Association of Deposit Insurers, formed to enhance deposit insurance effectiveness, has 83 members globally. Special privileges, such as deposit insurance, are referred to as "public backstops."

As of year-end 2017, the 10 largest banks in the world as measured by the market value of their common stock in order of size were JPMorgan Chase & Co. ($376 billion), Bank of America Corp. ($313 billion), Industrial & Commercial Bank of China ($312 billion), Wells Fargo ($306 billion), China Construction Bank ($228 billion), HSBC Holdings ($205 billion), Citigroup ($200 billion), Bank of China ($166 billion), Royal Bank of Canada ($117 billion), and Commonwealth Bank of Australia ($108 billion).

In this chapter, we look at depository institutions, with a primary focus on banks. We focus on the U.S. banking system, because it reflects the banking systems in other advanced economies. At the end of the chapter, we discuss a sector of the financial system referred to as the "shadow banking system" and the concerns associated with the activities of that nontraditional banking system.

Today we are aware of the role of the federal government in the regulation of commercial banks, but prior to 1863, the federal government played almost no role in their regulation. Instead, banks were regulated only at the state level. Realizing the need for a stronger banking system, the U.S. Congress passed the National Bank Act in 1863 authorizing the federal chartering of national banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) was created and empowered with providing national bank charters and regulation of national banks. As a result, there existed state and national banks, a structure popularly referred to as "dual banking." The dual banking structure still exists today, with every state having its own state banking department responsible for regulating banks chartered by the state.

Realizing the need for banks to obtain liquidity during periods of economic stress, the federal government wanted to establish a banking system that would have an entity that banks could borrow from, a sort of "lender of last resort." The U.S. Congress accomplished this with the passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. This legislation established the Federal Reserve System (FRS) as the central banking system. Banks that were members of the FRS were entitled to all the services that the FRS was empowered to provide by the legislation. We discuss these services later in this section. The legislation required that all nationally chartered banks become members of the FRS. State-chartered banks had the option to become members. Most state-chartered banks elected not to become members.

Today, state-chartered banks can be classified as state banks that are members of the FRS and nonmember state banks. With the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, the capital requirements that we shall discuss for member banks were also applied to state-chartered nonmember banks.

Today, banks are regulated and supervised by several federal and state government entities. "Bank regulation" refers to a federal agency's authority to issue specific regulations and guidelines that govern the operations, activities, and acquisitions of banking organizations.

Once those regulations and guidelines are in place, bank supervision involves monitoring and examining the condition of individual banks and determining whether they are compliant with the regulations. Enforcement powers are granted to federal agencies if a bank fails to comply with regulations or is found to have financial difficulties. Below we discuss the three federal agencies that regulate banks: the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC. Before doing so, we discuss briefly the various types of bank structure.

The simplest form of bank structure is a national bank that has no subsidiaries. A more complex form is a national bank that has two subsidiaries, an operating subsidiary that performs typical bank activities (discussed later) and a financial subsidiary that undertakes activities that are financial in nature. There are two types of holding company structures. (A holding company is one that owns other companies.) In a bank holding company, the parent holding company has as part of its holdings a national bank and a state bank. In a financial holding company, the parent holding company has as its holdings a national bank and a securities company. Basically, financial holding companies are conglomerates that are allowed to engage in a wide range of financially related activities. Large banks are typically financial holding companies, and the activities performed by the securities company are the investment banking activities that we describe in chapter 9.

# The Federal Reserve

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or simply, the Fed) was established in 1913. Its objective is to regulate banks and certain other types of depository institutions through bank reserves so as to provide stability to the banking sector through its authority to conduct national monetary policy. In addition, the Fed has the authority to conduct safety and soundness examinations of bank holding companies, the U.S. branches of foreign banks, and state-chartered banks that are members of the FRS.

The responsibilities of the Fed were significantly expanded by the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (also called the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer

Protection Act of 2010 (hereafter the Dodd-Frank Act). The former made the Fed the umbrella regulator for financial holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act made the Fed the primary regulator of all financial firms (bank and nonbanks) that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designates as systemically significant,[2] as well as the safety and soundness authority over the payment, clearing, and settlement systems that the FSOC identifies as systemically important and that are not regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the SEC. Consequently, not only does the Fed have the power of examining banks, it now also oversees the country's systemic risk.

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

The OCC is an independent bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The head of the OCC is the comptroller of the currency and is appointed by the president of the United States, with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. It is the responsibility of the OCC to charter, regulate, and supervise both national banks and federal savings associations. The Dodd-Frank Act made the OCC the primary regulator of federal savings associations. The OCC also supervises federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. The OCC's goal in supervising banks and federal savings associations is to "ensure that they operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with laws requiring fair treatment of their customers and fair access to credit and financial products." To fulfill its responsibility, the OCC has examiners who are responsible for analyzing loan and investment portfolios, analyzing funds management, rating banks (using the system described later in this chapter), and determining compliance with consumer banking laws for national banks and federal savings associations with less than 10 billion in assets. Furthermore, the National Risk Committee of the OCC monitors the federal banking system to identify any potential or actual threats to the system's safety and soundness.

As with the Fed, the OCC's responsibilities include overseeing systemic risk. One way in which it does so is by surveying the underwriting practices of those it regulates—through the Survey of Credit Underwriting Practices—which identifies trends in lending standards and credit risk for the most common types of commercial and retail credit offered by national banks and federal savings associations.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that (1) insures deposits, (2) examines individual banks, (3) supervises banks, and (4) resolves both troubled or failed banks and any financial institution (bank or nonbank) that is designated a SIFI. Funding for the FDIC comes from the insurance premiums paid by banks and thrift institutions for deposit coverage and from interest the FDIC earns on investing in U.S. Treasury securities.

The FDIC is given broad authority to utilize deposit insurance funds to assist depository institutions if a determination is made that there is systemic threat to the financial system. This authority was granted to the FDIC by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. The involvement of the FDIC as the 2008 financial crisis worsened serves as an example of its functions. In October 2008, the FDIC made a determination of an increase in systemic risk to the system. First, with the approval of Congress as provided for in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the maximum amount of any deposit insured by the FDIC was temporarily increased to  $250,000 from its previous level of$ 100,000. (Subsequently the Dodd-Frank Act made the $250,000 ceiling permanent.) Second, the FDIC agreed to temporarily guarantee both all noninterest-bearing accounts without consideration for the $250,000 insurance ceiling and certain newly issued debt by banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies. (Subsequently the Dodd-Frank Act explicitly authorized the FDIC to guarantee bank debt.)

FDIC resolution role for troubled banks One of the most critical roles of the FDIC is to provide a resolution when an FDIC-insured bank is about to fail. The resolution process followed by the FDIC is supposed to be executed in a manner that minimizes disruption to the banking system and maximizes value.

The FDIC assumes two roles in the resolution process. First, because it is an insurer, the FDIC protects all of the failing bank's depositors for the amount of their insured deposits by using one of the three resolution methods discussed later in this chapter. Second, the FDIC serves as the bank's receiver and administers the receivership estate for all creditors. These two roles played by the FDIC—protecting depositors in its insurer role and acting as receiver for all creditors—are functionally different.

The FDIC can employ three basic resolution mechanisms for failing insured banks: (1) purchase and assumption transactions, (2) deposit payoffs, and (3) open bank assistance transactions.

In a purchase and assumption transaction, a bank purchases some or all of the assets of a failed bank and assumes some or all of the liabilities, including all insured deposits. To complete the transaction, the acquiring (assuming) bank occasionally may receive some form of assistance from the FDIC.

In a deposit payoff transaction, the failing bank is closed, and the FDIC is appointed receiver. In its role as insurer, the FDIC immediately pays all depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors whose deposits are uninsured and other general creditors of the bank do not receive any payment but instead receive from the FDIC in its role as receiver a certificate entitling the holder to a portion of the proceeds received by the FDIC when the failed bank's assets are liquidated. The certificate is called a receivership certificate.

In the third resolution method, an open bank assistance transaction, the FDIC in its role of insurer provides financial assistance to a bank that is in danger of failing. The FDIC does so by making loans to the bank, purchasing the assets of the bank, or placing additional deposits in the bank. This resolution method is no longer commonly used because of restrictions imposed by legislation in the early 1990s on what the FDIC can do.

FDIC resolution role for systemically important financial institutions Prior to 2008, the FDIC had the authority to resolve troubled insured banks and thrifts. However, it did not have the right to take any action against other financial institutions that were not insured banks or thrifts. So, for example, the FDIC did not have the authority to place into an FDIC receivership a holding company or an affiliate of an insured bank or any other nonbank financial company that might pose a systemic threat to the financial system.

The best-known example of these financial entities excluded from FDIC receivership is Lehman Brothers, whose failure caused major disruption to global financial markets. The resolution could potentially have been realized through the U.S. bankruptcy courts. However, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in October 2008 clearly demonstrated that the bankruptcy system was not equipped to deal with the swift resolution of a financial institution whose failure posed a major threat to the financial system.

Because of this regulatory gap in the government's resolution authority, the Dodd-Frank Act extended the FDIC's receivership power and authority to allow it to effect an orderly liquidation of troubled financial institutions (banks and nonbanks) designated as global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) by the FSOC. The act requires that all bank holding companies with assets of more than 50 billion designated as G-SIBs prepare a resolution plan that could be achieved through the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The plan—commonly referred to as a "living will"—must describe how, in the event of material financial distress or failure, the G-SIB would be resolved in a rapid and orderly manner under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The U.S. Congress felt that bankruptcy would be the preferred procedure for resolving the failure of a G-SIB. However, it realized that it might be unrealistic to expect U.S. bankruptcy courts to do so in a manner that would reduce the risk of a systemic threat to the financial system. For this reason, it included in the Dodd-Frank Act a provision that grants the FDIC broad backup authority to place any G-SIB into an FDIC receivership process.

The FDIC can use this authority if (1) no reasonable private sector solution is available to avert the default of the G-SIB and (2) a resolution that could potentially be obtained through the bankruptcy process would have serious adverse effects on the financial system. This is not a blanket authority granted to the FDIC. Instead, the Dodd-Frank Act requires a two-thirds vote of the Federal Reserve Board and the board of the FDIC and a determination by the secretary of the Treasury to carry out this authority.

# Bank Regulation

Bank regulation has three components: (1) safety and soundness, (2) deposit insurance, and (3) systemic risk. We described the role of bank regulators with respect to systemic risk earlier in the chapter. Our focus here is on the first two components.

Safety and Soundness Regulation

In broad terms, safety and soundness regulation and supervision involve assessing a bank's likelihood of defaulting and, if a default does occur, assessing the magnitude of the losses that will be realized by the bank's creditors and stockholders.

Bank ratings To measure the safety and soundness of a bank, an examiner conducts on-site examinations with a focus on reviewing and rating a bank's performance, financial condition, and regulatory compliance with regulations. The result of the on-site examination is a bank rating. The use of a bank rating system increases the likelihood that bank examiners will be consistent in their examinations of banks while allowing for differences that exist among banks owing to bank size and the complexity and riskiness of a bank's revenue-generating activities. The system used to rate banks that has been adopted by federal bank regulators is the CAMELS rating system, which stands for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk. It has the elements shown in table 6.1.

Table 6.1 Elements of CAMELS bank ratings.

<table><tr><td>Element</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Capital adequacy</td><td>A capital adequacy assessment entails assessing a bank relative to its risks, such as credit risk, market risk, and other risks associated with the bank&#x27;s financial position on both balance sheet and off-balance-sheet items.</td></tr><tr><td>Asset quality</td><td>An asset quality assessment entails assessing existing and potential credit risk associated with a bank&#x27;s portfolio, as well as risks associated with the bank&#x27;s off-balance-sheet items. Included in this analysis are recent changes in a bank&#x27;s default rate on loans, exposure to counterparty risk, the performance of the portfolio, and changes in the marketability of assets.</td></tr><tr><td>Management</td><td>A management assessment involves assessing the corporate governance of a bank by its senior management team and board of directors. Management oversight and systems in place to deal with compliance and interaction with external auditors, for example, are examined.</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings</td><td>Current earnings and their sustainability are examined to rate a bank&#x27;s earnings quantity and quality.</td></tr><tr><td>Liquidity</td><td>A bank&#x27;s liquidity is assessed by looking at the bank&#x27;s ability to fulfill its expected funding needs in a timely manner without incurring excessive losses that could result if the bank were forced to sell assets at a significant discount from market prices. Other liquidity factors that examiners assess are economic factors, such as the trend of deposits and the stability of deposits.</td></tr><tr><td>Sensitivity to market risk</td><td>Because a bank&#x27;s assets and off-balance-sheet items are affected by changes in the factors that drive their values, bank examiners assess the market risk exposure to these factors. Also considered in assigning a rating is the ability of the bank&#x27;s management to manage the portfolio&#x27;s risk exposure to control a mismatch in the duration of assets and liabilities, as well as management&#x27;s ability to monitor and control permitted trading activities.</td></tr></table>

Capital adequacy and capital requirements Later in this chapter we discuss the various activities undertaken by banks. Of course, these activities can result in the realization of losses. To protect depositors, a bank must have adequate capital to absorb such losses, as well as to mitigate the potential risk that widespread banking losses may occur that would adversely affect the credit market and the real economy. As part of its safety and soundness regulation, the amount of capital that a bank needs to have on hand to absorb losses must be determined. That amount, referred to as a bank's capital requirement, is determined by regulators relative to the bank's total assets and the risk attributes associated with the assets in which the bank has invested.

Minimum capital requirements are established by regulators and then applied by them in their supervisory role. However, there is not just one minimum capital requirement, because regulators have established several categories of capital. To establish a bank's minimum capital requirement, regulators must evaluate the trade-off between imposing a level that is reasonable to reduce the risk of default and maintaining a bank's ability to remain solvent but at the same time is not so high that it would severely restrict the amount of capital available for credit to the different sectors of the economy.

For a business, the term "capital" refers to the amount of equity supplied by the stockholders of a firm, or in this case, a depository institution's stockholders. It is measured by the difference between the value of the assets and the value of the liabilities. When determining a bank's capital, the regulations mandate that total assets and liabilities be measured in different ways. This results in different definitions of capital.

Because the amount of capital required cannot be invested in higher-earning assets, capital requirements for a bank represent a cost of doing business. Capital requirements are constantly being revised. At one time, the rules were based solely on the view of U.S. regulators regarding capital adequacy. Since 1988, capital requirements have been established based on an international framework developed by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and referred to as the Basel Accords. Unlike the pre-1988 capital requirements, which in the United States were based on a bank's total assets, the various standards established by the Basel Accords (described later in this chapter) link capital requirements to the risks associated with a bank's assets, and hence the standards are referred to as risk-based capital requirements. The principle is simple: the riskier an asset is, the greater the capital required to protect against the risk of loss will be. Initially, the sole risk that was considered in the Basel Accords was credit risk. In later Basel Accords, capital requirements were based on market risk and operational risk in addition to credit risk.

The Basel Accords—referred to as Basel I (the first accord, published in 1988), Basel II, and Basel III—which establish a bank's capital requirements are constantly undergoing changes and modifications. It is impractical to delve into their nuances and calculations here. Instead, we will review some of the broader principles involved.

Under the Basel Accords, the calculation of risk-based capital requirements can be done in one of two ways. The first is based on an external assessment of the credit riskiness of a bank and is referred to as the standardized approach. In this approach, the assets held by a bank are grouped by type of financial instrument and are further grouped by the credit rating associated with the obligor. Examples of an external assessment would be the ratings assigned by the CRAs.

The second approach is based on a bank's internal credit risk models and internal rating system and accordingly is referred to as the internal rating-based approach. Banks that adopt this approach are permitted to apply their own internal measures for determining the key drivers of credit risk as primary inputs to the calculation of their capital requirement, with the stipulations that certain conditions must be satisfied and explicit supervisory approval is required. The credit risk models allow the bank to determine the probability of default of the borrowers in its portfolio and to construct an estimate of loss should a default occur. Once these risk measures are obtained from internal models, they are converted into risk weights, which are used to determine capital requirements using a formula set by the BIS.

The Basel Accords are built on what the BIS refers to as three "pillars": (1) minimum capital requirements, (2) supervisory review process, and (3) market discipline. Our focus here is on the first pillar, which deals with the calculation of the minimum capital requirement based on credit, market, and operational risk. The starting point is defining what is meant by "capital." At this stage of our understanding of capital markets, explaining the components is difficult. Suffice it to say that the BIS defines Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, the difference lying in what components make up each.

Tier 1 capital, also referred to as core capital or basic equity, includes two components. The first is permanent shareholders' equity. This is stock issued by the bank that is fully paid common stock and perpetual preferred stock. Perpetual preferred stock is preferred stock that does not mature and for that reason is considered permanent equity. The second component of Tier 1 capital is "disclosed reserves." This component is a little more difficult to grasp, but it is basically the amount of profits retained and any reserves that the bank has set aside for general or legal contingencies.

Tier 2 capital, also called supplementary capital, comprises several components; we mention only two here. The first is hybrid (debt/equity) capital instruments, a category that includes financial instruments that combine the characteristics of equity capital and debt. The second is subordinated debt, which includes conventional unsecured subordinated debt capital instruments with a minimum original fixed term to maturity exceeding five years and preferred stock that has a limited life (as opposed to perpetual preferred stock).

Regulatory capital is based on the liability/stockholders' equity side of the balance sheet. What must be determined next is how much weight to give to the different financial instruments in the bank's portfolio. This is needed because it is not the total assets of the bank but the risk-weighted assets that are considered in assessing regulatory capital. Thus, weights must be assigned to each financial instrument. The BIS determines what those weights should be for each asset. There are weights based on credit risk, market risk, and operational risk, and the weights also depend on the method the bank chooses for calculating its capital requirement, the standardized approach or the internal rating-based approach, which we discuss later in this chapter.

Based on the definition of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets, a capital ratio is calculated. A bank's total capital ratio may not be less than  $8\%$  of Tier 1 capital.

# Deposit Insurance

Because of the important economic role played by banks, the U.S. government sought a way to protect banks against depositors who, because of what they thought were real or perceived problems with a bank, sought to withdraw funds in a disruptive manner. Bank panics occurred frequently in the early 1930s, resulting in the failure of banks that might have survived economic difficulties except for the massive withdrawals they experienced.

The federal government created a backstop, devised in 1933, to prevent a run on the bank: federal deposit insurance. This insurance was provided through a new agency, the FDIC. A year later, federal deposit insurance was extended to S&Ls with the creation of the Federal Savings and Loan

Insurance Corporation. In 1933, federal deposit insurance covered accounts up to  $2,500. Today the standard maximum deposit insurance amount is$ 250,000. The maximum coverage applies per depositor, per insured depository institution, for each account ownership category. Since federal deposit insurance was established in 1933, no depositor has lost any money on an FDIC-insured deposit.

Even though federal deposit insurance achieved its objective of preventing runs on banks, it unfortunately created incentives that encouraged managers of depository institutions to take on excessive risks. If highly risky investments work out, the benefits accrue to the stockholders and management; however, if they do not, it is the depositors who are supposed to absorb the losses. Yet depositors feel little concern about the risk that a depository institution is assuming, because their funds are insured by the federal government. From a depositor's perspective, as long as the amount deposited does not exceed the insurance coverage, one depository institution is as good as another.

The pricing of premiums imposed by the FDIC for its first 50 years in operation differed significantly from the current system. Basically, during this 50-year period, all insured depository institutions paid a premium for insurance coverage based on the institution's size. More specifically, an annual premium rate of 3.3 to 8.3 cents was paid for every 100 of insured deposits. Legislation in the 1980s and 1990s altered this system, effectively turning such premiums into penalties for violating risk-based capital requirements or acts violating the supervisory process rather than for insurance coverage per se. In the absence of any violations, the FDIC charged no premiums for deposit insurance coverage, regardless of the risk profile of an institution.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 mandated that the FDIC establish a risk-based deposit insurance assessment system. The FDIC complied with the mandate by adopting a regulatory system that classified insured depository institutions into nine risk categories. The classifications were based on a combination of two factors. The first was a capital evaluation, and the second was a supervisory rating. The capital evaluation was based on data contained in an insured depository institution's Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, more commonly referred to as the Call Report. Based on these data, an insured depository institution was assigned a capital evaluation of either well capitalized (Group 1), adequately capitalized (Group 2), or undercapitalized (Group 3). A consolidation of the nine risk categories into just four risk categories was made by the FDIC in 2007, once again basing the categorization of an insured depository institution on capital evaluations and supervisory ratings.

In 2010, the FDIC was ordered by the Dodd-Frank Act to amend its methodology for assessing pricing for insured depository institutions. The final rules eliminated risk categories for large institutions; they also combined the CAMELS ratings described earlier in the chapter and forward-looking financial measures to obtain one of two scores. The first score was for what was classified as highly complex institutions. The second score was for all others classified as large institutions. For large and highly complex institutions, the two scores are (1) a performance-based score and (2) a loss severity score. These scores are then combined to obtain a total score.

The total assessment rate that determines the price of deposit insurance for an insured depository institution is obtained (after some adjustments) through calculations that convert the total score into the amount of the assessment obligation. However, these final amendments for assessing risk for the purpose of pricing deposit insurance are likely to be modified further to be more consistent with the standardized approach under the Basel III risk-based capital rules described earlier.

# Bank Activities

Commercial banks are involved in numerous income-generating activities, which can be broadly classified as follows: (1) individual banking, (2) institutional banking, and (3) global banking. Of course, different banks generate more activity in some areas than in others. For example, money center banks (defined later) are more active in global banking.

Individual banking encompasses consumer lending, residential mortgage lending, consumer installment loans, credit card financing, automobile and boat financing, brokerage services, student loans, and individual-oriented financial investment services (such as personal trust and investment services). Mortgage lending and credit card financing generate interest and fee income. Mortgage lending is often referred to as "mortgage banking." Brokerage services and financial investment services also generate fee income.

Loans to nonfinancial corporations, financial corporations (such as life insurance companies), and government entities (state and local governments in the United States and foreign governments) fall into the category of institutional banking. Also included in this category are commercial real estate financing, leasing activities, and factoring (i.e., purchasing of accounts receivable of a business). In the case of leasing, a bank may be involved in leasing equipment as a lessor,[6] as a lender to lessors, or as a purchaser of leases. Loans and leasing generate interest income, and other services that banks offer institutional customers generate fee income. These services include management of the assets of private and public pension funds, fiduciary and custodial services, and cash management services (such as account maintenance, check clearing, and electronic transfers).

In the area of global banking, banks now compete head-to-head with another type of financial institution—investment banking firms. Global banking covers a broad range of activities involving corporate financing and capital market and foreign exchange products and services. Most global banking activities generate fee income rather than interest income. At one time, some of these activities were restricted by federal legislation. More specifically, the Banking Act of 1933 contained four sections barring commercial banks from certain investment banking activities. These four sections are popularly referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act. After decades of debate regarding the need for such restrictions, the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed with the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999, which expanded the permissible activities for banks and bank holding companies.

Corporate financing involves two components. The first is the procuring of funds for a bank's customers, which can go beyond traditional bank loans to involve the underwriting of securities. When assisting their customers to obtain funds, banks also provide bankers' acceptances, letters of credit, and other types of guarantees for their customers. That is, if a customer borrows funds backed by a letter of credit or other guarantee, its lenders can look to the customer's bank to fulfill the obligation. The second area of corporate financing involves providing advice on such matters as strategies for obtaining funds, corporate restructuring, divestitures, and acquisitions.

Capital market and foreign exchange products and services involve transactions in which the bank may act as a dealer or broker in a service. For example, some banks are dealers in U.S. government or other securities. Customers who wish to transact in these securities can do so through the government desk of the bank. Similarly, some banks maintain a foreign exchange operation, buying and selling foreign currency. Bank customers in need of foreign exchange can use the services of the bank. In their role as dealers, banks generate income in three ways: (1) through the bid-ask spread; (2) from capital gains on the securities or foreign currency used in transactions; and (3) in the case of securities, through the spread between interest income earned by holding the security and the cost of funding the purchase of that security.

The financial products developed by banks to manage risk also yield income. These products include interest rate swaps, interest rate agreements, currency swaps, forward contracts, and interest rate options. We discuss each of these products in later chapters. Banks generate either commission income (i.e., brokerage fees) or spread income from selling such products.

# Bank Funding

When describing the nature of the banking business, we focused on how a bank can generate income. We now look at how a bank can raise funds. The three sources of funds for banks are (1) deposits, (2) nondeposit borrowing, and (3) common stock and retained earnings. Banks are highly leveraged financial institutions, which means that most of their funds come from borrowing—the first two sources. Included in nondeposit borrowing are borrowing from the Federal Reserve through the discount window facility, borrowing reserves in the federal funds market, and borrowing through the issuance of instruments in the money and bond markets.

# Deposits

Several types of deposit accounts are available. Demand deposits (checking accounts) not paying any interest or minimal interest can be withdrawn on demand. Savings deposits pay interest (typically below market interest rates), do not have a specific maturity, and usually can be withdrawn on demand.

Time deposits, also called certificates of deposit, have a fixed maturity date and pay either a fixed or a floating interest rate. Some certificates of deposit can be sold in the open market prior to their maturity if the depositor needs funds. Other certificates of deposit cannot be sold. If a depositor elects to withdraw the funds from the bank prior to the maturity date, the bank imposes an early withdrawal penalty. A money market demand account is one that pays interest based on short-term interest rates. The market for short-term debt obligations is called the money market, which is how these deposits get their name. They are designed to compete with money market mutual funds.

# Reserve Requirements and Borrowing in the Federal Funds Market

A bank cannot invest  $1 for every$ 1 it obtains in deposit. All banks must maintain a specified percentage of their deposits in a noninterest-bearing account at one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. These specified percentages are called reserve ratios, and the dollar amounts based on them that are required to be kept on deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank are called required reserves. The reserve ratios are established by the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed). The reserve ratio differs by type of deposit. The Fed defines two types of deposits: transactions and nontransactions deposits. Demand deposits and what the Fed calls "other checkable deposits" are classified as transactions deposits. Savings and time deposits are nontransactions deposits. Reserve ratios are higher for transactions deposits relative to nontransactions deposits.

To arrive at its required reserves, a bank does not simply determine its transactions and nontransactions deposits at the close of each business day and then multiply each by the applicable reserve ratio. The determination of a bank's required reserves is more complex. Here we give a rough idea of how it is done. First, to compute required reserves, the Federal Reserve uses an established two-week period called the deposit computation period. Required reserves are the average amount of each type of deposit held at the close of each business day in the computation period, multiplied by the reserve requirement for each type.

Reserve requirements in each period are to be satisfied by actual reserves, which are defined as the average amount of reserves held at the close of business at the Federal Reserve Bank during each day of a two-week reserve maintenance period, beginning on Thursday and ending on Wednesday two weeks later. For transactions deposits, the deposit computation period leads the reserve period by two days. For nontransactions deposits, the deposit computation period is the two-week period four weeks prior to the reserve maintenance period.

If actual reserves exceed required reserves, the difference is referred to as excess reserves. Because reserves are placed in noninterest-bearing accounts, an opportunity cost is associated with excess reserves. At the same time, the Fed imposes penalties on banks that do not satisfy the reserve requirements, giving banks an incentive to manage their reserves so as to satisfy reserve requirements as precisely as possible.

Banks temporarily short of their required reserves can borrow reserves from banks with excess reserves. The market where banks borrow or lend reserves is called the federal funds market. The interest rate charged to borrow funds in this market is called the federal funds rate. Because of the importance of this market, which is part of the interbank lending market, we discuss it further in chapter 25, where we cover the money market.

Borrowing at the Fed Discount Window

The Federal Reserve Bank is the banker's bank—or, to put it another way, the bank of last resort. Banks temporarily short of funds can borrow from the Fed at its discount window.

Collateral is necessary to borrow, but not just any collateral will do. The Fed establishes (and periodically changes) the types of eligible collateral. Currently it includes (1) Treasury securities, federal agency securities, and municipal securities, all with a maturity of less than six months, and (2) commercial and industrial loans with 90 days or less to maturity.

The interest rate that the Fed charges to borrow funds at the discount window is called the discount rate. The Fed changes this rate periodically to implement monetary policy. Bank borrowing at the Fed to meet required reserves is quite limited in amount, even though the discount rate generally is set below the cost of other sources of short-term funding available to a bank. The Fed views borrowing at the discount window as a privilege to be used to meet short-term liquidity needs and not as a device to increase earnings.

Continual borrowing for long periods and in large amounts is thereby viewed as a sign of a bank's financial weakness or as exploitation of the interest differential for profit. If a bank appears to be going to the Fed frequently to borrow relative to its previous borrowing pattern, the Fed will make an "informational" call to ask for an explanation for the borrowing. If no subsequent improvement in the bank's borrowing pattern occurs, the Fed then makes an "administrative counseling" call, in which it tells the bank that it must stop its borrowing practice.

# Other Nondeposit Borrowing

Most deposits have short maturities. Bank borrowing in the federal funds market and at the discount window of the Fed is short term. Other nondeposit borrowing can be short term (in the form of issuing obligations in the money market) or intermediate to long term (in the form of issuing securities in the bond market). An example of the former is the repurchase agreement (or "repo") market, which we discuss in chapter 26. Examples of intermediate or long-term borrowing are floating-rate notes and bonds.

Banks that raise most of their funds from the domestic and international money markets, relying less on depositors for funds, are called money center banks. In contrast, a regional bank is one that relies primarily on deposits for funding and makes less use of the money markets to obtain funds. In recent years, the mergers of larger regional banks with other regional banks have formed so-called "superregional banks." With their greater size, these superregional banks can compete in certain domestic and international financial activities that were once the domain of money center banks.

# Nonbank Depository Institutions: Thrifts

Thrifts are nonbank depository institutions; they include savings institutions and credit unions. As with banks, thrifts can operate under a federal or state charter and have their deposits insured by a federal agency. The federal insurer can be the FDIC for savings associations and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) for credit unions. All depository institutions are subject to periodic regulatory and federal insurance examination.

Although there are differences between banks and thrifts in terms of the activities in which they specialize and certain regulatory oversights, all depository institutions have become more like each other in the past two decades and their differences have become less distinct. The new regulatory structure as set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act and the slight expansion in the range of activities permitted for thrifts, as well as the adoption of the international capital standards required by the Basel Accords, have been the latest and most dramatic step toward blurring the distinction between thrifts and banks.

# Savings Institutions

Savings institutions include S&Ls and savings banks. These thrifts are either mutually owned or operate under corporate stock ownership. "Mutually owned" means no stock is outstanding, so technically the depositors are the owners. The provision of funds for financing the purchase of a home motivated the creation of savings institutions, and accordingly, residential mortgages typically compose the principal assets of savings institutions.

The Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 mandates that a federal savings association is required to be a qualified thrift lender. There is a test to qualify, the qualified thrift lender test, which requires that the thrift hold qualified thrift investments equal to at least  $65\%$  of its asset portfolio. The list of QTLs includes many home-related lending and other forms of retail lending (e.g., student loans, automobile loans). Examples of home-related lending are (1) loans to purchase, refinance, construct, improve, or repair domestic residential or manufactured housing; (2) home equity loans; and (3) securities backed by or representing an interest in mortgages on domestic residential or manufactured housing.

For funding, savings institutions offer accounts that look similar to demand deposits and that pay interest, called negotiable order of withdrawal accounts. They also offer money market deposit accounts, can borrow in the federal funds market, have access to the Fed's discount window, and can borrow from the Federal Home Loan Banks (which are called advances).

Larger S&Ls operate as holdings companies (SLHCs). According to the Home Owners' Loan Act, an SLHC includes any company that directly or indirectly controls either a savings association or any other company. As institutions, savings banks are similar to, although much older than, S&Ls..

With respect to regulation, the Dodd-Frank Act transferred regulatory responsibility for thrifts from the Office of Thrift Supervision to two federal banking agencies. More specifically, the OCC has enforcement authority over federal savings associations, but the FDIC has the same authority over state savings associations. The OCC and the FDIC have different enforcement policies from those that the Office of Thrift Supervision had. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, SLHCs are regulated in almost the same manner as bank holding companies. The OCC and FDIC have the supervisory authority to limit activities that are legally permissible for savings associations.

Although major legislation dealing with depository institutions came about as a result of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, prior substantial legislation followed the financial problems faced by S&Ls in the 1980s, referred to as the S&L crisis. The appendix to this chapter describes this crisis. It is worthwhile reading about the S&L crisis, because it provides an excellent example of a poorly designed financial institution that was from the outset likely to fail and impose substantial costs on U.S. taxpayers.

Credit unions are the smallest of the depository institutions. Credit unions can obtain either a state or a federal charter. The Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 authorized the formation of federally chartered credit unions in all states. Their unique aspect is the "common bond" requirement for credit union membership. According to the statutes that regulate federal credit unions, membership in a federal credit union "shall be limited to groups having a common bond of occupation or association, or to groups within a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district."

Credit unions are either cooperatives or mutually owned. No corporate stock ownership is permitted. The dual purpose of credit unions is therefore to serve their members' saving and borrowing needs. Technically, because credit unions are owned by their members, member deposits are called shares. The distribution paid to members is therefore in the form of dividends, not interest.

The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund insures the shares of all federally chartered credit unions. State-chartered credit unions may elect to have National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund coverage; for those that do not, insurance coverage is provided by a state agency.

Federal regulations apply to federally chartered credit unions and state-chartered credit unions that elect to become members of National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Most states, however, specify that state-chartered institutions must be subject to the same requirements as federally chartered ones. Effectively, therefore, most credit unions are regulated at the federal level. The principal federal regulatory agency is the NCUA.

Credit unions obtain their funds primarily from deposits of their members. With deregulation, they can offer a variety of accounts, including share drafts, which are similar to checking accounts but pay interest. The Central Liquidity Facility, which is administered by the NCUA, plays a role similar to the Fed's as the lender of last resort. The Central Liquidity Facility provides short-term loans to member credit unions with liquidity needs.

Credit union assets consist of small consumer loans, residential mortgage loans, and securities. Regulations 703 and 704 of the NCUA set forth the types of investments in which a credit union can invest. They can make investments in corporate credit unions. What is a corporate credit union? One might think that a corporate credit union is a credit union set up by employees of a corporation. It is not. Federal and state-chartered credit unions are referred to as "natural person" credit unions, because they provide financial services to qualifying members of the general public. In contrast, corporate credit unions provide a variety of investment services, as well as payment systems, only to natural person credit unions.

# Shadow Banking

What we have described above concerning depository institutions is referred to as the "traditional banking system" for providing credit. As explained, there is considerable regulation of the depository institutions because of the important role that credit plays in financial markets and the real economy. Moreover, public backstops are available to depository institutions to minimize risk to depositors and to the financial system in general.

An important contributor to the 2008-2009 financial crisis was a system that few market participants were aware of—the shadow banking system. We conclude this chapter with a discussion of shadow banks.

To put the shadow banking system into perspective, we can place it in the context of two common forms of credit intermediation:[7] (1) nonintermediated, direct lending, whereby borrower and lender interact directly, and (2) intermediated lending through traditional banking, whereby banks take in deposits and lend them to customers (consumers, businesses, and governments). Shadow banking is a form of credit intermediation, a market-based form of lending, that involves entities and activities that are outside the traditional banking system. It therefore lacks the regulation of and backstops available to banks.

As mentioned in chapter 3, financial intermediaries perform such functions as maturity intermediation and diversification. Traditional banks perform these functions and have been the primary form of credit intermediation. As explained in this chapter, this is done through a regulatory structure that examines banks for safety and soundness, allows for the control of credit, and provides a backstop for depositors when financial problems arise (through deposit insurance) and by providing a lender of last resort.

In the mid-1970s, new approaches to obtaining credit appeared that differed from both traditional banking and nonintermediated, direct lending. These new approaches, the result of the financial innovations occurring at that time, resulted in what has been referred to as shadow banking. The adjective "shadow" indicates that this form of credit intermediation was far less transparent to the public and to regulators than was traditional banking.[8] The legal entities created for the purpose of shadow banking transactions were called special-purpose vehicles (SPVs). As with traditional banking, shadow banking involved substantial leverage. In fact, because of the lack of regulation, the leverage available in shadow banking was much greater than that available in traditional banking. Despite the greater risks of liquidity and leverage associated with shadow banking compared to traditional banking, this form of credit intermediation took place in a system that lacked the public backstops that exist in traditional banking.

SPVs created for the purpose of shadow banking obtain their funding not through deposits, as is done by traditional banks, but through a chain of market-based transactions. It is difficult to explain these transactions for funding for shadow banks at this stage of our study of financial markets, because they make use of some of the financial innovations and participation by parties described in later chapters of this book. The chain of transactions typically involves an SPV issuing commonly used debt obligations, such as commercial paper and repurchase agreements (see chapter 26). However, funding is not limited to those two common forms of borrowing. There are also relatively new forms of debt obligations, referred to as structured credit instruments, that use the securitization technology described in chapter 27. The debt obligations issued by SPVs are acquired by such market participants as collective investment vehicles (e.g., mutual funds), insurance companies, and pension funds. Effectively, these participants are the equivalent of depositors, but they are not protected by depository insurance.

Although our description makes it seem as though shadow banking and traditional banking are independent (i.e., the parties involved in shadow banking are separate from traditional banks), that is not the case. The SPVs created for shadow banking transactions are linked not only to major banks but also to major investment banking firms and insurance companies. The major risk with shadow banks is that because of the absence of public backstops available to banks (such as deposit insurance and a lender of last resort), the SPVs involved in this form of credit intermediation are susceptible to greater funding risk (i.e., the risk that the SPV is unable to obtain funding at a favorable interest rate to make lending profitable). This situation then leads to the liquidation of an SPV by its lenders and is the equivalent of a run on a bank.

From the inception of shadow banking up to 2008, investors viewed the credit instruments issued by SPVs as having very little credit risk, as well as having little funding risk. SPVs created by traditional banks were supported by the bank with a line of credit. Moreover, the view was that in times of credit stress, there would be indirect credit and funding backstops available to bank-created SPVs, because a bank could draw on the public backstops available to it through the Fed.

How important, as measured by liabilities, was the shadow banking system? A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated that at its peak, in 2008, the liabilities were  $20 trillion. The traditional banking system at the time had liabilities totaling$ 11 trillion.[10] Consequently, shadow banking was not a minor sector of the financial system. In fact, the same study estimated that the shadow banking system's liabilities had surpassed those of the traditional banking system as early as 1996!

Difficulties regarding liquidity and asset valuations did occur at various points after the inception of shadow banking. However, the difficulties were resolved without impairing the growth of the shadow banking system. By 2008, however, several conditions in the financial market had precipitated a major collapse of the shadow banking system. Specifically, asset valuation declined for mortgage-related assets, and because a large portion of the assets in which the SPVs invested consisted of such assets, the value of SPVs declined. As a result, SPVs found it difficult to generate positive returns on their asset portfolios. The problems in the financial market also resulted in the tightening of credit, making it extremely difficult for SPVs to obtain new funding once their short-term debt matured. All these events underscored the vulnerability of the shadow banking system.

The conclusion of a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had the following to say about the shadow banking system:

The shadow banking system has its benefits. It serves the same function as traditional banking but in some areas maintains advantages due to superior market knowledge and specialization. Despite declining shadow banking system holdings following the crisis, these entities are unlikely to disappear soon. Given the continued presence, size, and risks, and the credit flows and economic growth benefits that shadow banking facilitates, the proper dose and measure of reform is crucial. Devising how to address vulnerabilities is no small task because of how the system has intertwined itself with traditional banking, particularly with the large global banks. Realigning incentives will not be easy.[11]

- Bank examiners conduct on-site examinations with a focus on reviewing and rating a bank's performance, financial condition, and regulatory compliance.
- The system used to rate banks that has been adopted by federal bank regulators is the CAMELS rating system, covering capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk.
- There are two types of holding company structures in the banking industry: (1) a bank holding company, in which the parent holding company has as part of its holdings a national bank and a state bank, and (2) a financial holding company, in which the parent holding company has as its holdings a national bank and a securities company.
- Financial holding companies are conglomerates that are allowed to engage in a wide range of financially related activities.
- The Federal Reserve is the primary regulator of all financial firms (bank and nonbanks) designated as systemically significant; it also has safety and soundness authority over the payment, clearing, and settlement systems that are systemically important and are not regulated by other government agencies.
- The Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters, regulates, and supervises both national banks and federal savings associations.
- The OCC examiners are responsible for analyzing loan and investment portfolios and funds management, rating banks, and determining compliance with consumer banking laws for national banks and federal savings associations with less than 10 billion in assets.
- The Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) is an independent federal agency that (1) insures deposits, (2) examines individual banks, (3) supervises banks, and (4) resolves both troubled or failed banks and any financial institution (bank or nonbank) that is designated as a systemically important financial institution.
- If the OCC makes a determination that there is systemic threat to the financial system, the FDIC has broad authority to utilize deposit insurance funds to assist depository institutions.
- An important role of the FDIC is to provide a resolution when a troubled FDIC-insured bank is about to fail.
- The FDIC assumes two roles in the resolution process: (1) as an insurer of deposits and (2) as a receiver and administrator of the receivership estate for all creditors.
- The FDIC basically can use one of three basic resolution methods: (1) purchase and assumption transactions, (2) deposit payoffs, and (3) open bank assistance transactions.
- The Dodd-Frank Act extended the FDIC's receivership power and authority to allow it to effect an orderly liquidation of troubled financial institutions (banks and nonbanks).
- As part of its safety and soundness regulation, the amount of capital that a bank needs to absorb losses must be determined. It is referred to as a bank's capital requirements.
- Minimum capital requirements are established by regulators and then applied by regulators in their supervisory role.
- A depository institution's capital is the amount of equity supplied by its stockholders and is measured as the difference between the value of the assets and the value of the liabilities.
- The various standards established by the Basel Accords link capital requirements to the risks associated with the assets; hence the standards are referred to as risk-based capital requirements.
- The underlying principle behind risk-based capital requirements is that the riskier an asset is, the more will be the capital required to protect against the risk of loss.
- Under the Basel Accords, the calculation of risk-based capital requirements can be determined using either the standardized approach or the internal rating-based approach.
- The Basel Accords are built on three pillars: minimum capital requirements, a supervisory review process, and market discipline.

- The major risk with shadow banks is that because of the absence of public backstops available to banks, such as deposit insurance and a lender of last resort, SPVs are susceptible to greater funding risk, which can lead to the liquidation of an SPV by its lenders and is the equivalent of a run on the bank.

# Questions

1. In a March 17, 2009, speech titled "Finance: A Return from Risk," delivered before the Worshipful Company of International Bankers in London, Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England and chair of its Monetary Policy Committee, stated:

Banks are dangerous institutions. They borrow short and lend long. They create liabilities which promise to be liquid and hold few liquid assets themselves. That though is hugely valuable for the rest of the economy. Household savings can be channelled to finance illiquid investment projects while providing access to liquidity for those savers who may need it.

13. The following passage appeared in the Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in The United States, submitted to Congress in January 2011:

In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections—the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, federal deposit insurance, ample regulations—to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued America's banking system in the 19th century. Yet, over the past 30-plus years, we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system—opaque and laden with short-term debt—that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system. Key components of the market—for example, the multitrillion-dollar repo lending market, off-balance-sheet entities, and the use of over-the-counter derivatives—were hidden from view, without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns. We had a 21st-century financial system with 19th-century safeguards.

Explain what this passage means.

# Appendix: The S&L Crisis

As indicated in main text of this chapter, although major legislation dealing with depository institutions came about as a result of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, prior substantial legislation followed the financial problems faced by S&Ls in the 1980s, referred to as the S&L crisis. This appendix describes this crisis. It is worthwhile reading about the S&L crisis, because it provides an excellent example of a poorly designed financial institution that was from the outset likely to fail and cause substantial costs to U.S. taxpayers.

The details of the growth of the S&L industry since the late 1960s and the ensuing S&L crisis would fill an entire book, so only the basics of the problems of this industry are presented here. Until the early 1980s, S&Ls and all other lenders financed housing through traditional mortgages at interest rates fixed for the life of the loan. The period of the loan was typically long, frequently up to 30 years. Funding for these loans, by regulation, came from deposits having a maturity considerably shorter than the loans. Such a situation creates the funding risk of lending long and borrowing short. It is extremely risky, although regulators took a long time to understand it.

No problem arises, of course, if interest rates are stable or declining. But if interest rates rise above the interest rate on the mortgage loans, a negative spread results, eventually leading to insolvency. Regulators at first endeavored to shield the S&L industry from the need to pay high interest rates without losing deposits by imposing a ceiling on the interest rate that would be paid by S&Ls and by their immediate competitors, the other depository institutions.

However, the approach did not and could not work.

With the high volatility of interest rates in the 1970s, followed by the historically high level of interest rates in the early 1980s, all depository institutions began to lose funds to competitors exempt from ceilings, such as the newly formed money market funds; this development forced some increase in ceilings. The ceilings in place since the middle of the 1960s did not protect the S&Ls, which began to suffer from diminished profits and increasingly from operating losses. A large fraction of S&Ls became technically insolvent as rising interest rates eroded the market value of their assets to the point where assets fell short of liabilities.

Regulators, anxious to cover up the debacle of their empire, let these S&Ls continue to operate, worsening the problem by allowing them to value their mortgage assets at book value. Profitability worsened with deregulation of the maximum interest rate that S&Ls could pay on deposits. Even though deregulation allowed S&Ls to compete with other financial institutions for funds, it also raised funding costs. Banks were better equipped to cope with rising funding costs, because bank portfolios were not dominated by old, fixed-rate mortgages, as S&Ls were. A larger portion of bank portfolios consisted of shorter-term assets and other assets whose interest rates reset to market interest rates after short periods.

The difficulty of borrowing short and lending long was only part of the problem faced by the industry. As the crisis progressed and the situation of many S&Ls became hopeless, fraudulent management activities were revealed. Many S&Ls facing financial difficulties also pursued strategies that exposed the institution to greater risk in the hope of recovering if these strategies worked out. What encouraged managers to pursue such high-risk strategies was that depositors were not concerned with the risks associated with the institution where they deposited funds, because the U.S. government, through federal deposit insurance, guaranteed the deposits up to a predetermined amount. Troubled S&Ls could pay existing depositors through attracting new depositors by offering higher interest rates on deposits than financially stronger S&Ls offered. In turn, to earn a spread on the higher cost of funds, troubled S&Ls had to pursue riskier investment policies.
