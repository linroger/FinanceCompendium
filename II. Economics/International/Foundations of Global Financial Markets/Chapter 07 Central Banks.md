In economies or groups of economies, the process by which the supply of money is created is a complex interaction among several economic agents that perform different functions at different times. The agents are business firms and households who both save and borrow, depository institutions that accept savings and make loans to firms, government entities, individuals and other institutions, and the nation's central bank, which also lends and buys and sells securities.

In this chapter, we explain the role of central banks in the complex process of creating the money supply. To do this, we use the example of the U.S. central bank (the Federal Reserve Bank or simply "the Fed") in the creation of the supply of money to highlight its interaction with banks and other units of the economy. We also explain the tools that the Fed can use to manage the rate of growth in the money supply. We then examine the goals of monetary policy; that is, the conditions in the economy that the Fed seeks to bring about. Although the Fed cannot directly cause these conditions to exist, it can follow policies to target variables that it can influence with its tools. We begin with a brief description of the role of central banks in general and then focus on the U.S. central bank. We conclude with a discussion of the issues related to global central banks.

# Central Banks and Their Purpose

The primary role of a central bank is to maintain the stability of the currency and money supply for a country or a group of countries. To be a little more specific, let's look at the central bank of the United Kingdom, the Bank of England. On its website, it identifies its role in financial stability as follows:

Risk assessment: monitoring current developments both in the United Kingdom and abroad—including links between financial markets and the wider economy and, within financial markets, between different participants—to identify key risks to the financial system. For example, the Bank examines the overall financial position of borrowers and lenders; the links between financial institutions; and the resilience and vulnerability of households, firms, financial institutions, and international financial systems to changes in circumstances. The Bank also conducts risk assessment and research on the major developed countries and the main emerging-market economies.

Risk reduction: reducing vulnerabilities and increasing the financial system's ability to absorb unexpected events. This can involve the promotion of codes and standards over a wide field, ranging from accounting to improving legal certainty, and management of countries' external balance sheets.

Oversight of payment systems: oversight of the main payment and settlement systems in the UK that are used for many types of financial transaction—from paying wages and credit card bills to the settlement of transactions between financial institutions.

Crisis management: developing and coordinating information sharing within the Bank, with the FSA and HM Treasury, and with authorities internationally to ensure future financial crises are handled and managed effectively. In undertaking this work, the Bank advises on and implements policy measures to mitigate risks to the financial system.

One of the major ways that a central bank accomplishes its goals is through monetary policy. For this reason, a central bank is sometimes referred to as a monetary authority (e.g., Monetary Authority of Singapore, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Bermuda Monetary Authority). In implementing monetary policy, central banks require private banks to maintain and deposit the required reserves with the central bank (we discuss reserve requirements later in this chapter). For this reason, a central bank is also referred to as a reserve bank (e.g., Reserve Bank of Australia, Reserve Bank of India, and South African Reserve Bank).

When discharging its responsibilities during a financial crisis or to avert a financial crisis, central banks perform the role of lending of last resort for the banking system. For example, the Bank of England states the following for its role as lender of last resort:

In exceptional circumstances, as part of its central banking functions, the Bank may act as "lender of last resort" to financial institutions in difficulty, in order to prevent a loss of confidence spreading through the financial system as a whole.

The central banks of the 19 member countries of the Group of Twenty (G20) countries are listed in table 7.1. Established in 1999 as an international forum for finance ministers and central bank governors of developing economies to discuss key issues of the global economy, the G20 includes 19 member countries plus the central bank of the European Union (the European Central Bank, ECB). The ECB, which came into being on January 1, 1999, is responsible for implementing the monetary policy for the member countries of the European Union. The European System of Central Banks consists of the ECB and the central banks of the member countries. Also listed in the second column of table 7.1 are the names of the 19 major central banks.

There is widespread agreement that the central bank should be independent of the government so that decisions of the central bank will not be influenced for short-term political purposes, such as pursuing a monetary policy to expand the economy but at the expense of inflation.[2] As stated in a speech by Frederic Mishkin, a former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on April 3, 2008: "Evidence supports the conjecture that macroeconomic performance is improved when central banks are more independent."[3] He provides examples from the Bank of England and Bank of Canada.[4] Moreover, this view is supported by several studies of central banks of industrialized countries.

In 1975, as a result of the oil crisis and economic recessions being faced throughout the world, the United States formed an informal meeting of senior financial officials from five countries in addition to the United States: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. The group, which became known as the Group of 6 (G6), decided to meet annually thereafter. The following year, Canada joined the group, which then became known as the Group of 7 (G7). In 1998, Russia joined the group and it became known as the Group of 8 (G8). In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8 and it once again became known as the G7. Although the G7 can concur on economic and financial policies and establish objectives, compliance is voluntary.

# The Central Bank of the United States: The Federal Reserve System

The most important agent in the money supply process is the Federal Reserve System, which is the central bank of the United States and is often called the Federal Reserve or "the Fed." Created in 1913, the Fed is the government agency responsible for the management of the U.S. monetary and banking systems. Most large commercial banks in the United States are members of the Federal Reserve System. The Fed is managed by a seven-member Board of Governors, who are appointed by the president and approved by the Congress. These governors have 14-year appointments (with one appointment ending every two years), and one governor is the board's chair. The Chairmanship of the Fed is a highly visible and influential position in the world economy. The Federal Reserve System consists of 12 districts covering the entire country; each district has a Federal Reserve Bank that has its own president.

An important feature of the Fed is that, by the terms of the law that created it, neither the legislative nor the executive branch of the federal government should exert control over it. From time to time, critics charge that the Fed guards this autonomy by accommodating either the White House or Congress (or both) far too much. The Fed has substantial regulatory power over the nation's depository institutions, especially commercial banks.

It is worth noting here, before we discuss the Fed's tools for monetary management, that financial innovations over the past two decades have made the Fed's task more difficult. The public's increasing acceptance of money market mutual funds has funneled a large amount of money into what are essentially interest-bearing checking accounts. (See chapter 32 for more information on mutual funds.) Another relevant innovation is the practice of asset securitization, which we discuss in chapter 27. Securitization permits commercial banks to change what once were illiquid consumer loans of several varieties into securities. Selling these securities in the financial markets gives the banks a source of funding that is outside the Fed's influence. The many hedging instruments to be analyzed in part VIII of this book have also affected banks' behavior and their relationship with the Fed. In general, that transformation amounts to reduced Fed control of banks and increased difficulty in implementing monetary policy.

# The Fed and the Supply of Money

Tools of Monetary Policy to Influence the Money Supply

The Fed has several tools by which it influences, indirectly and to a greater or lesser extent, the amount of money in the economy and the general level of interest rates. These tools are reserve requirements (whose use is somewhat constricted by congressional mandate), open market operations, open market repurchase agreements, and the discount rate. These instruments represent the key ways that the Fed interacts with commercial banks in the process of creating money. Our discussion of these tools explains the impact of their use on a generally specified money supply. Later in this chapter we describe the money supply in more detail.

Reserve requirements Bank reserves play an important role in the U.S. banking and monetary system and are directly linked to the growth in the money supply. Generally, the higher the growth rate in reserves, the higher the rate of change in the money supply. Later in this chapter, we discuss this linkage in some detail. At this point, we want to focus on the meaning and function of reserve requirements.

The United States has a fractional reserve banking system, which means that a bank must hold or "reserve" some portion of the funds that savers deposit in a form approved by the Fed. As a result, a bank may lend to borrowers only a fraction of what it takes in as deposits. The ratio of mandatory reserves to deposits is the required reserve ratio. For many years, the Fed had the authority to set this ratio. In the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA) of 1980,

Congress assumed much of that responsibility, establishing new rules regarding this ratio to be applied to all depository institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts of various types, and credit unions.

In a key provision of the DIDMCA, Congress adopted a basic ratio of  $12\%$  for what are termed checkable or transactional accounts, that is, demand deposits, or accounts on which checks may be written often. For nontransactional but short-term deposit accounts—known as time deposits—the required reserve ratio is  $3\%$ . The 1980 law also authorizes the Fed to change the required reserve ratio on checking accounts to any level between  $8\%$  and  $14\%$ , and to raise it to  $18\%$  under certain conditions. In early 1992, the Fed reduced the ratio to  $10\%$  for banks with total checkable accounts at or above $46.8 million. For banks with smaller totals in these accounts, the required reserve ratio is  $3\%$ . A bank must maintain the required reserves as either currency on hand (that is, cash in the bank) or deposits in the Federal Reserve itself. The more important form is the deposit, which serves as an asset for the bank and as a liability of the Fed.

A bank has excess reserves if its reserves amount to more than the Fed requires. A bank's total reserves equal its required reserves plus any excess reserves. A bank whose actual reserves fall short of required levels can borrow excess reserves from other banks (see chapter 25 for more on the federal funds market), or it can borrow reserves from the Fed itself, which we discuss later in this chapter.

Open market operations The Fed's most powerful instrument is its authority to conduct open market operations, which means that the Fed may buy and sell, in open debt markets, government securities for its own account. These securities may be U.S. Treasury bonds, Treasury bills, or obligations of federal agencies. The Fed prefers to use Treasury bills, because, in that large and liquid market, it can make its substantial transactions without seriously disrupting the prices or yields of bills. When it buys or sells, the Fed does so at prices and interest rates that prevail in these debt markets. The parties to the Fed's transactions may be commercial banks or other financial agents who are dealers in government securities.

The unit of the Fed that decides on the general issues of changing the rate of growth in the money supply, by open market sales or purchase of securities, is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC consists of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and presidents of some of the other district Fed banks. This committee meets approximately every six weeks to analyze economic activity and levels of key economic variables. The variables may include short-term interest rates (such as the federal funds rate), the U.S. dollar's rate of exchange with important foreign currencies, commodity prices, and excess reserves, among other things.[5] After this analysis, the committee sets the direction of monetary policy until the next meeting. This direction is summarized in a brief "directive" at the time of the announcement after the meeting. The minutes of these meetings are published at a later time.

The implementation of policy, through open market operations, is the responsibility of the trading desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The desk transacts, in large volume, with large securities firms or commercial banks that are dealers, or market makers, in Treasury securities. Although the desk does not buy and sell for profit, it functions as a rational investor, buying at the lowest prices and selling at the highest prices offered at the time of the transactions.

Fed purchases augment the amount of reserves in the banking system. If the seller is a commercial bank, it alters the composition, but not the total, of its assets by exchanging the securities for reserves at the Fed. If the seller is not a bank, much or all of the check with which the Fed pays will probably be deposited in a bank. The bank receiving the deposit would experience an increase in liabilities (the customer's deposit) and in assets (the growth in its reserve account at the Fed). In either case, the proceeds from selling the securities to the Fed raise the banking system's total reserves. Such an increase in reserves typically leads to an increase in the money supply. Individual banks whose reserves rise will generally make new loans, equal to the new deposit less required reserves, because loans earn interest whereas reserves do not. New loans represent growth in the money supply.

Conversely, the Fed's sale of Treasury securities reduces the money supply (or its rate of growth), because the funds that security dealers pay for the securities come from either deposits at banks or, if the dealers are banks, from the banks' own accounts. A reduction in deposits reduces reserves and leaves the banks less to lend.

Open market repurchase agreements The Fed often employs variants of simple open market purchases and sales, and these are called the repurchase agreement (repo) and the reverse repo. The Fed conducts these transactions, which are actually more common than the outright purchases or sales,[6] with large dealers in government securities and, occasionally, with central banks of other countries.

In a repurchase agreement, the Fed buys a particular amount of securities from a seller that agrees to repurchase the same number of securities for a higher price at some future time, usually a few weeks. The difference between the original price and the repurchase price is the return earned by the Fed for letting the dealer have the cash for the life of the agreement and, also, the cost to the dealer of borrowing from the Fed. In a reverse repo (also known as a matched sale or a matched sale-purchase transaction), the Fed sells securities and makes a commitment to buy them back at a higher price later. The difference in the two prices is the cost to the Fed of the funds and the return to the buyer for lending money.

An example illustrates some of the features in a Fed repurchase agreement. (A detailed analysis of repos appears in chapter 25.) Suppose the Fed wants to increase bank reserves for some reason over a short period of time, and it seeks out a financial institution that has  $20 million in Treasury securities but no excess reserves. Suppose further that the institution wants to lend$ 20 million for seven days to a borrower. After some discussions, the Fed agrees to "buy" the securities from the institution at a price that reflects the current repo rate, and to "sell" them back in seven days, when the institution's borrower pays off that loan. The current annualized rate is  $4.3\%$ . The transaction would look like this: The Fed would buy the securities for approximately $19,983,292 and sell them back, seven days later, to the institution at the principal value of $20 million. The difference of nearly 16,708 is the interest the institution pays for the seven-day financing and the return to the Fed for lending that money. And for those seven days, the financial institution and the entire banking system can enjoy an increase in reserves, if, of course, the bank keeps the roughly 20 million in its account at the Fed.

The Fed uses repos and reverse repos to bring about a temporary change in the level of reserves in the system or to respond to some event that the Fed thinks will have a significant but short-lived effect. A particularly good example of such an event is a large payment by the U.S. Treasury (as in tax refunds or Social Security benefits) that sharply but temporarily raises reserves at the banks. Of course, these temporary changes in the system's reserves alter the banks' ability to make loans and, ultimately, to prompt growth in the money supply for a short period.

Discount rate As mentioned in chapter 6, the Fed makes loans to banks that are members of the system. A bank borrowing from the Fed is said to use the discount window, and these loans are backed by the bank's collateral. The rate of interest on these loans is the discount rate, set at a certain level by the Fed's Board of Governors. As the rate rises, banks are understandably less likely to borrow; a falling rate tends to encourage them to borrow. Proceeds from discount loans are also reserves and increase the banks' capacity to make loans. Banks generally do not prefer to gain reserves in this way, because the loans cost money as well as invite increased monitoring of the borrowing banks' activities. Accordingly, the flow of this borrowing has a very slight impact on the money banks have and can lend and, therefore, on the supply of money.

There is general agreement that the discount rate is the least effective tool at the Fed's disposal, and its use in monetary policy has diminished over time. Today, changes in the discount rate function largely as the Fed's public signals about its intention to change the rate at which the money supply is growing.

# Different Kinds of Money

Until now, we have spoken in general terms about the money supply. But we can be more precise and identify several different meanings of the word "money" and several different types of money.

First of all, money is that item which serves as a numeraire, or unit of account—in other words, the unit that is used to measure wealth. In the

United States, the numeraire is the dollar; in Japan, it is the yen; and so on. Second, we call money any instrument that serves as a medium of exchange, that is, anything that is generally accepted in payment for goods, services, and capital transactions. In the United States, the medium of exchange encompasses currency, which is issued by the Treasury or the Fed, and demand deposits, which support payment by means of checks and are held at depository institutions, such as commercial banks. The medium of exchange also performs the function of being a store of value, which means that the exchange medium can be used to carry resources over from the present to the future. Obviously, this function is impaired in times of high and unpredictable inflation. Other accounts that resemble demand deposits include the NOW account (or Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account) and share drafts of credit unions.

Other assets that do not function in the role of medium of exchange have many properties in common with the numeraire. These properties include safety, divisibility, and high liquidity (which is the capacity to be transformed into the medium of exchange promptly and at negligible cost). Because of these properties, these assets are good substitutes for money, in particular, as stores of value. The assets of this type include time deposits at commercial banks or thrifts. These accounts earn interest over their specified lives, and the investor may not draw on the money in the account for a transaction, without incurring a penalty, until the deposit's maturity date. Other assets that are substitutes for money include balances in money market mutual funds.

# Money and Monetary Aggregates

Monetary policy and the actions of the Federal Reserve System often concentrate on what are called monetary aggregates. The purpose of the aggregates is to measure the amount of money available to the economy at any time.

The most basic monetary aggregate is the monetary base. Also termed "high-powered money," the base is defined as currency in circulation (or coins and Federal Reserve notes held by the public) plus the total reserves in the banking system. It is important to note that reserves make up the bulk of the base, which is under the control of the Fed. Thus, this aggregate is the one that the Fed is most able to influence with its various monetary tools.

The instruments that serve the role of medium of exchange—currency and demand deposits—are included in a monetary aggregate that is sometimes referred to as the narrow measure of the money supply and is labeled  $\mathbf{M}_1$ . Thus,  $\mathbf{M}_1$  measures the amount of the medium of exchange in the economy.  $\mathbf{M}_2$  is a more inclusive aggregate, because it takes into account all the instruments that substitute for money in the capacity of storing value. Therefore,  $\mathbf{M}_2$  is defined as  $\mathbf{M}_1$  plus all dollars held in time and savings accounts at banks and thrift institutions, plus all dollars invested in retail money market mutual funds, plus some additional accounts (such as overnight repurchase agreements). Some analysts also watch developments in two other monetary aggregates, which are labeled  $\mathbf{M}_3$  and  $\mathbf{L}$  (for liquid assets). These aggregates ( $\mathbf{M}_3$  and  $\mathbf{L}$ ) equal  $\mathbf{M}_2$  plus certain other financial assets, including long-term time deposits, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, and some Treasury securities.

The ratio of the money supply to the economy's income (as reflected by the gross national product or some similar measure) is known as the velocity of money in circulation. Velocity measures the average amount of transactions carried by a dollar. If the economy's velocity were stable, monetary policy could achieve any desired level of income by simply targeting the aggregate. Unfortunately, velocity is not a stable relationship, and in fact, the linkages between the economy's income and the various aggregates vary considerably over time.

Typically, the monetary aggregates move in somewhat similar patterns, rising and falling at roughly the same rates and at roughly the same times. A major question in Fed policymaking (which we discuss below) has revolved around choosing the most appropriate definition of the money supply.

The Money Multiplier: The Expansion of the Money Supply

Our discussion of how the supply of money is created focuses on the linkage between the banking system's reserves and the aggregate  $\mathbf{M}_1$ . The process we describe, the money multiplier, can be generalized to the other monetary aggregates, but the complexities involved in those processes are not relevant to our task now.

We begin by restating that the creation of the money supply and changes in it are the result of complex interactions of four parties: the Fed, banks, savers, and borrowers. The Fed provides reserves to banks and also requires banks to hold, as reserves, a portion of the deposits that the public holds at the banks. The banks, playing their key role in the money multiplier, lend the remainder of the deposits (or most of it) to borrowers at an interest rate that exceeds that of demand deposits. For any one bank, the remainder equals deposits less required reserves, which can be expressed as deposits times (1 - required reserve ratio). Clearly, the funds one bank lends to a borrower can become the borrower's deposits in another bank. The borrower's decision to hold wealth as deposits rather than cash also affects the money multiplier. Then, that second bank must keep a fraction of those new deposits as reserves and can lend out to other borrowers an amount equal to the deposits less required reserves.

We illustrate this process with an extended example. Suppose the Fed's required reserve ratio is 12\%, and deposits at Bank A are $100 million, and those at Bank B are $50 million. Bank A has reserves of $12 million and outstanding loans of $88 million, and Bank B has reserves of $6 million with loans to borrowers of $44 million. For Bank A, the loan amount to $88 million equals either $100 million of deposits less $12 million of reserves, or $100 million times (1 - 0.12). For Bank B, loans of $44 million equal $50 million minus the 12\% required reserves of $6 million. Thus, neither Bank A nor Bank B has any excess reserves (which equal total less required reserves). The level of reserves in the banking system has caused M₁ to reach the level of (let us say) $900 billion, which equals $250 billion in currency and $650 billion in demand deposits. For this example, we assume that the amount of currency in the system does not change.

The Fed can increase the reserves by either lending to the banks or by purchasing government securities from the banks or other investors. (We ignore here the Fed's authority to change the required reserve ratio.) In this example, suppose that the Fed buys 5 million of U.S. Treasury securities from a dealer who deposits the check, which is drawn on the Fed, with Bank

A. Bank A's reserve account with the Fed has increased by $5 million, and so have its (demand) deposits, its total reserves, and the overall level of M₁. But required reserves have risen only by $600,000. This leaves an additional 4.4 million that the bank is free and eager to invest in order to improve its income.

We continue by assuming that a machinery manufacturing firm borrows all of the  $4.4 million in a one-year loan, then buys equipment from a company that places all of that money in a checking account (or demand deposit) at another bank, which is Bank B. Bank A must transfer reserves for the amount of the loan to Bank B. The situation regarding Bank A is this: Its level of deposits remains unchanged at$ 105 million; its loans have increased by $4.4 million to $92.4 million; its reserves have fallen by $4.4 million (from $17 million to $12.6 million); so its ratio of reserves to deposits is again the required 12\%, and it has reached its capacity for making loans because Bank A's deposits are unchanged from their level of $900.005 billion.

After the transaction, Bank B's deposits have risen by $4.4 million, an increase that raises the amount by an additional $4.4 million (or $9.4 million altogether, so far) to $900.0094 billion. Bank B has total reserves of $10.4 million and excess reserves equal to 88\% of the $4.4 million in new deposits. Thus, Bank B can lend $3.87 million, keeping $528,000 as required reserves. If loans of 3.87 million are made to borrowers who place those loans as deposits with other banks, the process of creating money, in the form of M₁, will continue. Where will the process end, and what amount of new money, in the form of new demand deposits, will arise from the new reserves? In other words, what is the money multiplier?

In this example, the Fed's open market purchase of  $5 million of U.S. Treasury securities, along with the banks' incentive to make as many loans as they are permitted to, has created demand deposits of$ 9.4 million at the first two banks involved. Still more deposits can be created at other banks. This process will continue as long as other banks use the ever smaller increases in demand deposits to make loans, which become additional demand deposits and excess reserves at still other banks, and so on. Although the process has no set limit in terms of time, there is a maximum number of dollars in new demand deposits that will spring from the new reserves.

This process is a form of a multiplier series that can be expressed in an algebraic formula. If we let  $\Delta \mathrm{TDD}$  be the total demand deposits created,  $\Delta R$  be the reserves injected into the system by the Fed's purchase of Treasury securities, and  $\mathrm{REQ}$  be the required reserve ratio, then the total of new deposits generated by the expansion of the initial injection of reserves would equal:

$$
\begin{array}{r l} \Delta \mathrm {T D D} & = \Delta \mathrm {R} + (1 - \mathrm {R E Q}) \times \Delta \mathrm {R} + (1 - \mathrm {R E Q}) ^ {2} \times \Delta \mathrm {R} \\ & + (1 - \mathrm {R E Q}) ^ {3} \times \Delta \mathrm {R} + (1 - \mathrm {R E Q}) ^ {4} \times \Delta \mathrm {R} + \dots \end{array} \tag {7.1}
$$

Because there are many potential elements in this series, which can get cumbersome, it is best to use this simple version of it:

$$
\Delta \mathrm {T D D} = \Delta \mathrm {R} / \mathrm {R E Q}. \tag {7.2}
$$

In the example, REQ equals  $12\%$ , and  $\Delta R$  equals $5 million. Hence, new total demand deposits (if banks lend as much as they can and keep no excess reserves) amount to $5 million/0.12, or $41.67 million. The money multiplier is, therefore, 8.33 ($41.67/$5). As a result, total will reach $900.04167 billion when the process is completed, which equals the original $900 billion plus $41.67 million in new deposits. Equation (7.2) clearly shows that the eventual amount of the new demand deposits is negatively related to the required reserve ratio: As REQ falls, the change in TDD rises; and as REQ increases, the change in TDD declines. Thus, if everything in the example were the same, but REQ were  $10\%$  instead of  $12\%$ , the new demand deposits would reach 50 million.

Obviously, the process of reducing the money supply works in the opposite way. That is, if the Fed wants to drain reserves from the system and reduce the banks' lending ability, it sells securities. The reduction in reserves, as the public trades deposits for marketable securities, allows banks to make fewer new loans or to renew fewer old ones.

# The Impact of Interest Rates on the Money Supply

In chapter 15, we explain how changes in the money supply affect interest rates. We note here only that interest rates actually influence the change in the money supply. This point emerges from an evaluation of two key assumptions made above. $^{8}$  First, banks are assumed to want to make all the loans they can. If, however, banks were to keep some excess reserves, they would make fewer new loans and generate fewer deposits at other banks, which would affect the amount of  $\mathbf{M}_{1}$  that the Fed's purchase of securities would generate.

One of the important factors in a bank's decisions about excess reserves is the level of market interest rates. High rates make excess reserves costly, because they represent loans not made and interest not earned. If rates are low, banks may keep some excess reserves. Hence, the level of interest rates positively influences the amount of  $\mathbf{M}_1$  that any increase in reserves will create. Moreover, interest rates can also positively (but probably only slightly) affect the amount of reserves in the system: High market rates may prompt banks to borrow at the discount window in order to make loans, and these borrowed funds are part of reserves.

By the second assumption, borrowers retain none of their loans in cash, but rather deposit all cash flows—proceeds from sold securities, loans, and so on—into checking accounts. In contrast, if borrowers took some of their borrowings in cash, banks would receive fewer deposits and would have fewer reserves from which to make new loans. Accordingly, the public's demand for cash as a portion of its liquid wealth has an impact on the amount of  $\mathbf{M}_1$  that arises from the Fed's injection of new reserves.

The level of market rates shapes decisions about cash holdings. Many deposit accounts pay interest, so holding cash imposes an opportunity cost. The higher the rate is, the greater the cost will be, and the more money investors will shuttle into deposits. But the rate on deposits is not the only relevant interest rate. The desired amount of deposits, from which transactions can be easily made, also reflects the rates of return from other assets. As those returns rise, investors would hold more in deposit accounts. For these reasons, the level of interest rates positively affects the size of the money multiplier and, hence, the amount that any increase in reserves will produce.

An example illustrates this point about the impact of rates on the money multiplier and the change in the money supply arising from an infusion of reserves by the Fed. The money multiplier from the previous example was

8.33 or 1/REQ, where  $\mathrm{REQ}$  was 0.12. Let us now assume that the behavior of banks and depositors responds to interest rates. First, we will assume that the rate of return on bank loans is such that banks do not make all the loans they can but rather want to hold  $1\%$  of their deposits (TDD) in excess reserves (ER), with the result that the ratio ER/TDD equals 0.01. Second, let us suppose that the interest rate is at the level where the public will hold only  $75\%$  in checkable deposits (rather than  $100\%$  as before) and  $25\%$  in cash or currency. This means that the ratio C/TDD is 0.33. With these assumptions, the formula for the multiplier is now:

$$
\frac {1 + (\mathrm {C / T D D})}{\mathrm {R E Q} + (\mathrm {E R / T D D}) + (\mathrm {C / T D D})}.
$$

Plugging in the actual values, we have a much lower multiplier, which is:

$$
\frac {1 . 3 3}{0 . 1 2 + (0 . 1) + 0 . 3 3} = 2. 8 9.
$$

Remember, this multiplier is reduced because households and banks do not deposit or lend, respectively, all that they can, and these drains from the money creation process reduce the multiplier effect of any increase in reserves.

# The Money Supply Process in an Open Economy

Our discussion so far describes central bank activity in what economists call a closed economy. A closed economy is one in which foreign transactors—of either goods or financial assets—play a negligible role. In the modern era, almost every country has an open economy, where foreign firms and investors account for a large and increasing share of economic activity. This is especially true of the world's largest economy, that of the United States. An understanding of the money supply process therefore must include the influence of the foreign sector.

Monetarily, the crucial fact of significant foreign participation in the U.S. economy is that foreign central banks, firms, and individuals hold a substantial number of U.S. dollars. They do so for transactional reasons—buying and selling goods and services in the United States—and for investment purposes—treating the dollar as a financial asset. What makes the foreign holdings of dollars important is that the dollar's exchange rate with currencies of most developed countries floats according to demand and supply in the market. (As explained in this chapter, most central banks, including the Fed, try to keep exchange rates within politically acceptable ranges.)

Shifts in the dollar's exchange rates affect the prices of domestic and imported goods, the revenues of U.S. companies, and the wealth of all investors in the country. As a result, the Fed accepts responsibility for maintaining some stability in the exchange rates. A major way to discharge this duty is to intervene in the foreign exchange markets. (See chapter 19 for more detail on foreign currency markets.) The Fed intervenes by buying and selling foreign currencies for its own account. (Most central banks of large economies own, or stand ready to own, a large amount of each of the world's major currencies, which are considered international reserves.)

If the Fed thinks the dollar's value is too high and a foreign currency's is too low, it can purchase some of the foreign currency with its own supply of dollars. A purchase involves increasing the outstanding number of dollars and thereby the monetary base. If the Fed thinks the dollar has too low a value relative to some other currency, it might sell some of its holdings of that currency for dollars. Thus, selling foreign currency entails a reduction in the monetary base. Intervention in the currency market is often a response to a particular international event. Moreover, the intervention usually involves a transaction with other central banks, which consists of an immediate exchange of currencies and an agreement for a future offsetting exchange. Thus, this kind of action allows the Fed to know the terms by which the currency deal will terminate and the time when it will terminate.

Our discussion of the elements of monetary policy in this chapter makes it clear that the dollar's exchange rates with important foreign currencies function as a major goal of monetary policy. That is, when forging and implementing policy, the Fed considers the effect of a change in the money supply on the relative value of the dollar in the foreign exchange market.

Dramatic evidence of the growing importance of international policy coordination on monetary matters occurred in two meetings of central bankers of the large industrial nations in the mid-1980s. In 1985, central bank chairpersons and directors of the United States, Great Britain, France,

Germany, and Japan (known as the Group of Five) met at the Plaza Hotel in New York. This is known as the Plaza Agreement. They agreed to coordinate policies to bring down the value of the U.S. dollar and to stabilize international exchange rates and trade. In 1987, at the Louvre Museum in Paris, central bankers from these five countries and Canada agreed to work together to keep exchange rates at their current levels. These efforts at international cooperation on monetary and exchange issues are generally seen as successful.[9]

# Goals of Monetary Policy

By using such tools as open market operations (which change the reserves in the banking system), the Fed can prompt the banking system and depositors to implement desired changes in the money supply and in its rates of growth. The Fed manages the money supply to achieve certain economic goals. In this section, we identify some of the more commonly cited goals of Fed policy.[10]

Stability in prices is a major goal of the Fed. The standard way of measuring inflation is the change in a major price index. Based on the historical experience with inflation, policymakers and economists came to appreciate how unstable price levels retard economic growth, provoke volatility in interest rates, stimulate consumption, deter savings, and cause capricious redistribution of income and wealth with attendant social disturbances.

However, inflation in advanced economies is seldom (if ever) the result of excessive demand due to monetary or fiscal policy. A more important source of inflation is an economic shock in the supply of a crucial material, such as the oil shocks of the 1970s, which affected almost all countries. Evidence that the inflation at the end of the 1970s was not related to excessive demand for goods and services is that it occurred with high unemployment and gave the world a period of stagflation, which is a condition of both inflation and recession.

It is important to note that, when confronted with a supply shock, a central bank such as the Fed has two choices. First, the banking authorities can refuse to accommodate the higher price levels that follow the shock by matching them with an increase in the money supply. The results of nonaccommodation will initially tend to be higher interest rates and a decline in economic activity. For this reason, central banks and political authorities frequently have opted for the second choice, which is a policy of accommodation and increased growth in the supply of money. Unfortunately, this kind of policy permits the inflation to continue unchecked or possibly to accelerate.

High employment (or low unemployment) of the civilian labor force represents a second major goal of the Fed. Although politicians often speak of the U.S. government's commitment to promoting "full employment," most people understand that an unemployment rate of zero is not possible. The reason is that frictional unemployment—the temporary unemployment of those changing jobs or seeking new or better ones—is both unavoidable and helpful to an economy. It is unavoidable, because people do change jobs and are likely to do so more readily as employment levels rise, and because workers are always leaving or entering the labor market. Frictional unemployment is helpful, because it allows a constant reallocation of labor and leads to increased efficiency in the workforce.

Given that zero unemployment is not a feasible goal, the appropriate goal of the Fed and other governmental policymakers is actually a high level of employment. But economists and policymakers cannot agree on a suitable definition or specification of high employment. It does not help to specify a high level of employment as one that approaches  $100\%$  less the level of frictional unemployment, because there is also little agreement on the true rate of frictional unemployment. For practical purposes, many observers consider that a civilian unemployment rate between  $4\%$  and  $5\%$  indicates an economy operating at or near a level of high employment.

It is important to realize that high employment is one of the Fed's goals because, in certain circumstances, the Fed's policy can indirectly influence the level of employment. When the economy is operating sluggishly or below capacity, increases in the money supply can bring about economic expansion and employment, because those increases can reduce interest rates, stimulate investment, encourage consumption, and lead to the creation of new jobs. A policy of expansion of the money supply is frequently described as an "easy money policy," because the Fed is said to ease the way for banks to acquire reserves and extend loans. But when the economy's output is close to capacity (given its stock of productive assets and population), easy money policies can be disadvantageous, because they may kindle inflation and raise interest rates. Policymakers must often wrestle with the tough question of whether easing monetary policy will create higher employment or simply ignite inflation, or an undesirable combination of higher unemployment and higher inflation.

Economic growth, the third goal of the Fed, is the increase in an economy's output of goods and services. Clearly, this goal is closely related to the goal of high employment. As would be expected, there is little agreement about the exact rate of growth that policymakers should try to achieve. Variously described as "sustainable" or "steady" or "reasonable," the economy's appropriate rate of growth has to be substantial enough to generate high employment in the context of an expanding workforce but low enough to ward off inflation. The goal of stabilizing interest rates is directly related to the goal of growth and the Fed's responsibility for the health of the nation's financial and banking system.

Note that the goal is to stabilize rates, not to prevent changes in them. Interest rates move up and down with changes in economic conditions. Those movements can provide signals of important economic developments, and it would be a mistake for the Fed to try to prevent such changes in rates. However, the Fed may help economic conditions by trying to moderate the impact of large moves in rates. Some increases in rates may reflect temporary or reversible developments, and the Fed can appropriately respond to these changes in a way that eliminates or greatly reduces such increases.

Stability in foreign currency exchange rates is the final Fed goal that we will discuss. The foreign exchange market has become much more important in recent years, as the economies of the world have become more integrated, and foreign currency exchange rates have begun to affect ever larger segments of the economy. Because exchange rates are clearly dependent in some ways on the monetary policies of the major countries, the Fed has accepted the goal of stabilizing foreign exchange rates.[11] Of course, some fluctuations in exchange rates arise for economically sound reasons that monetary policy in one country cannot influence or control. A prime example is a pronounced difference in the fiscal policies between two countries. In general, an important explanation of unstable rates among most of the world's major currencies has been the failure of the large industrial economies to coordinate their fiscal and monetary policies.

A chief disadvantage of unstable foreign currency exchange rates is that volatility in the prices of currencies inhibits the international trade that offers a host of benefits to all participating countries. Furthermore, both high and low exchange rates for the dollar are considered detrimental to the U.S. economy. High exchange rates (i.e., a "strong" dollar or one with high value in terms of foreign currencies) reduce demand for U.S.-made products abroad and stimulate the import of foreign goods; the result is a trade imbalance. A "weak" dollar contributes to inflation, as U.S. buyers pay more for the many goods they do import. For these reasons, the Fed's goal of stability in the currency market often amounts to keeping the value of the dollar, in terms of the major foreign currencies, within some range that is considered politically acceptable and helpful for international trade, especially exports.

Trade-Offs and Conflicts among Policies

This account of the widely accepted goals of monetary policy reveals a profound problem in the conduct of monetary policy. The goals are numerous, but the Fed's capabilities are limited to the simple menu of (1) trying to raise the rate of growth in the money supply by providing more reserves to banks, and (2) trying to reduce the rate of monetary expansion by reducing the reserves in the banking system. As a result, often one goal may require a monetary policy that is inconsistent with some other goal. In other words, a monetary policy that furthers progress toward one goal may actually make attaining another either difficult or impossible.

For example, an easy money policy of expanding the money supply (that is, stimulating higher growth rates for one or more monetary aggregates) might appear to promote growth and low interest rates, but it might also raise the prospect of inflation, affect the exchange rate disadvantageously, and increase interest rates. Another example concerns the goal of price stability and the Fed's responsibility for the health of financial institutions. Suppose that, at a time of high inflation, many such institutions have invested according to inflationary expectations and have made many loans to firms dealing in real assets. Suppose, too, that the Fed decides it needs to take steps to curb current inflation. In such a situation, the tight monetary policy that accomplishes this goal—a policy of reducing the rate of growth in the money supply—actually may imperil the institutions, because the policy might well weaken the financial health of the firms that borrowed from the financial institutions.

Economists frequently describe this problem in this way: The Fed's policy necessarily represents trade-offs among its various goals, which have different levels of relative importance at different times, depending on the state of the economy. In other words, the Fed, like any monetary policymaker, has numerous goals, but at any given time, it focuses on the goal that is most in danger of not being achieved.

Goals and Types of Targets

A second problem in the implementation of monetary policy is that the Fed has no direct control over the goals that are the final objectives of its policies. The Fed cannot, with any of its monetary tools (open market operations, discount rates, etc.), directly influence such complex economic variables as the prices of goods and services, the unemployment rate, the growth in GDP, and foreign exchange rates. We know the Fed can affect the rate of growth in the money supply only by means of its control of reserves in the banking system. As discussed in chapter 6, the Fed cannot fully determine changes in the money supply. The growth in the money supply depends to a substantial degree on the preferences, actions, and expectations of numerous banks, borrowers, and consumers.

The Fed seeks to achieve its goals through a form of chain reaction, which has the following chronology and structure. The Fed first employs one or more of its tools to affect what are called operating targets, which are monetary and financial variables whose changes tend to bring about changes in intermediate targets. Intermediate targets, which may include interest rates or monetary aggregates, are variables that have a reasonably reliable linkage with the variables, such as output or employment, that constitute the Fed's goals or ultimate objectives. Thus, the Fed exerts whatever influence it has on the intermediate targets in an indirect way, by means of its control over the operating targets. So its power over the variables that make up its goals is quite indirect and dependent on the linkages among the various targets and goals.

Although economists have argued many years about the identity of appropriate operating and intermediate target variables, there is no dispute about the chief characteristics of a suitable operating or intermediate target.[12] The first characteristic is linkage: An operating target must have an expected connection with the intermediate target, which itself must eventually affect the economy in a way that is consistent with the Fed's goals. The second characteristic is observability: Both operating targets and intermediate targets must be readily and regularly observable economic variables, so that the Fed can monitor its success in influencing their levels or rates of change. The third and final characteristic is responsiveness: To function as an operating target, a variable must respond quickly and in an expected way to the Fed's use of one or more of its tools; and an appropriate intermediate target is one that reacts, in an anticipated way and a meaningfully short time, to changes in the operating target.

Choosing the operating target In some countries, a key foreign currency exchange rate may well function as an operating target. Although the Fed has become more conscious of foreign exchange developments in the past 15 years or so, it has not adopted the dollar's exchange rate with any currency or group of currencies as an operating target. Instead, the Fed's monetary policy has directly targeted either short-term interest rates or some measure of bank reserves.

An important point about the operating target is that the Fed must choose either a short-term rate or the level of some reserves and cannot choose to target both kinds of variables.[13] To understand why the Fed must make a choice, remember what the Fed's tools allow it to do. Those tools—whether the secondary ones of discount loans and management of reserve requirements, or the primary tool of open market operations—enable the Fed to change only the level of reserves in the banking system. Obviously, a change in reserves also changes short-term rates, because they are determined in the interbank market for excess reserves. Under most circumstances, the change in reserves is negatively related to the change in interest rates: As the Fed supplies more reserves and banks gain more ability to make more loans and buy other assets, the short-term rates fall; as the Fed withdraws reserves and reduces the banks' lending capacity, the short-term rates rise.

Because of this inverse relationship, it might seem possible for the Fed to view each of these variables as a target and to set them all simultaneously. But, in fact, that is impossible. The reason is that the Fed cannot know or predict the public's demand for money, which is the aggregate demand for holding some of its wealth in the form of liquid balances, such as bank deposits. The public's desire to hold money depends on many factors, especially preferences and anticipation about future income and price inflation, among other things. Unexpected changes in those factors may well shift the public's desired holdings in significant ways. Therefore, the Fed cannot be certain how much impact any change in reserves will have on short-term rates. Without knowledge of what the rate will be for a given change in reserves, the Fed cannot simultaneously determine both the rate and the level of reserves.

By choosing its operating target, then, the Fed makes the decision to let the other variable fluctuate in response to changes in the public's demand for money. When an interest rate is the target, the Fed must let the growth in reserves vary as it strives to keep that interest rate at a certain level or to smooth its transition to a new (higher or lower) level. When some aggregate of reserves is the target, the Fed is forced to allow interest rates to change substantially, so that it can try to bring the level of reserves to that dictated by the Fed's policy. Of course, the Fed can change its target from time to time in order to rein in the variable that has fluctuated while the Fed focused on the other. But however often the Fed might change targets, it remains a fact that, at any given time, the Fed cannot target both rates and reserves.

Choosing the intermediate target The best known of the intermediate targets is the money supply, measured by one of the more inclusive monetary aggregates that we described in chapter 6. In the 1970s, many countries began to target the growth rates of one or more aggregates. The policy, at least as publicly stated, was to supply reserves at a pace that would lead to a selected rate of growth in the aggregates. The idea behind this policy was that the goals of central bank activity—growth, stable prices, and so on—would be realized if the money supply were to grow at a known and steady rate. Over time, other intermediate targets have been specified, and they include foreign exchange rates, the level of national output (such as the gross domestic product), and the level of actual or expected inflation.[14] Furthermore, the array of interest rates—including rates available to consumers and investors—may also function as a target variable. We have said that a prime characteristic of a suitable intermediate target is that it is readily observable. Some of the candidates mentioned above do not fit that rule: Information on the GDP, for example, is available only on a quarterly basis, and measures of actual or expected inflation may be subject to considerable dispute.[15]

Interestingly, in recent years, many central banks have adopted inflation, despite certain problems in measurement, as a key intermediate variable. The reason is that the monetary aggregates have not had the kind of reliable and persistent relationship either with target variables or with goals that policymakers require. In most European countries, policymakers follow price indexes for sensitive commodities and make decisions about short-term rates and bank reserves on the basis of actual and expected inflation. In the United States, it is commonly said that former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan carefully monitored the price of gold, among other commodities. Thus, the purchasing power of the domestic currency and the foreign exchange rate of the currency have become far more typical intermediate targets than have monetary aggregates.

# Global Central Banks

We conclude this chapter with a brief description of several aspects of global central banks. The investigation of global bank regulation and supervision was motivated by the global banking crisis of 2008. These banking problems still plague many countries. Systemic banking crises have continued to destabilize global economies since 1990.[16]

Measuring bank regulation and supervision around the world is, however, difficult. Hundreds of laws and regulations, emanating from different components of national and local governments, define policies regarding bank capital standards, the entry requirements of new domestic and foreign banks, bank ownership restrictions, and loan provisioning guidelines.

Table 7.2 provides information on the global commercial banking system for four selected countries: Brazil, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The information provided is the number of banks, the proportion of assets in government-owned banks, the proportion of banking assets in foreign-owned banks, the number of official bank supervisors per bank in the country, and the percentage of the 10 largest banks in a country that are rated by one of the major international rating agencies. The high, low, and median values for each characteristic shown in the table's last three columns are for 180 countries. As can be seen, the range of these characteristics for the global banking is significant.

Among the major findings for the 180 countries covering the period from 1999 through 2011 is the substantial heterogeneity of bank regulatory and supervisory policies across countries. And, although there has been some convergence for some types of banking sector policies, bank regulatory and supervisory policies remain quite diverse. The diversity in regulatory regimes provides an excellent opportunity for research examining the causes of these policy differences, the impacts of banking policies on the performance of banks, and the related effects on the overall financial sector and real economy. The last column in table 7.1 provides the ratio of public debt to its GDP for the 19 countries whose central banks are shown in the table.

# Key Points
- The central bank of a country plays a key role in that country's economic and financial markets by implementing policies to stabilize the currency and controlling the money supply.
- The central bank may also act as a lender of last resort to the bank system in order to avert a financial crisis.
- Evidence suggests that a central bank can act more effectively by being independent of the government.
- The Federal Reserve System is the U.S. central bank.
- The Fed's tools of monetary policy include required reserves, open market operations and repurchases, and discount loans to banks.
- The Fed supplies reserves to the banking system, which participates, along with investors, in generating the money supply.
- The chief means of supplying reserves is open market operations: The Fed's purchase of government securities provides reserves, and the Fed's sale of securities reduces reserves.
- The money supply is composed of various types of money as well as demand and time deposits, which can be grouped into monetary aggregates.
- The fundamental aggregate is the monetary base, composed of currency plus total reserves in the banking system.
- $\mathrm{M}_{1}$  equals currency plus all checkable deposits; other aggregates include various time deposits.
- The money multiplier is the process by which changes in bank reserves generate larger changes in the money supply.
- Banks use added reserves to buy assets or to make loans; the seller or borrower redeposits these proceeds, which then support additional loans, and so on.
- The value of the multiplier depends on the required reserve ratio, the public's demand for cash, the banks' willingness to make loans, and the level of interest rates.
- The growing international integration of economies requires that the Fed, along with other central banks, consider the impact of its monetary operations on foreign currency exchange rates.
- The goals of monetary policy include a stable price level, economic growth, high employment, stable interest rates, and predictable and steady currency exchange rates.
- Monetary policies involve difficult trade-offs, and policies that help achieve one goal may make another goal less attainable.
- Because the Fed has no direct control or influence on the complex economic variables that constitute the goals, it must identify intermediate targets that influence these variables and are, in turn, influenced by operating targets that are variables the Fed can control to a substantial extent.
- The Fed's intermediate targets may be interest rates, monetary aggregates, or possibly exchange rates.
