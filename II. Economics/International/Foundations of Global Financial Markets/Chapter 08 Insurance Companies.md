Insurance companies provide (sell and service) insurance policies, which are legally binding contracts. According to the insurance contract, insurance companies (or simply, "insurers") promise to pay specified sums contingent on the occurrence of some specified future event or events, such as death or an automobile accident. Thus, insurers are risk bearers. They accept or underwrite the risk in return for a fee, referred to as an insurance premium, paid by the policyholder.

Insurers are key participants in a country's economy not only as suppliers of risk management products for a country's households, businesses, and governments, but also as major investors. With the funds available to invest from the premiums received, insurers are major buyers of the investment products described in later chapters, as well as participants in the financial derivatives markets described in part VIII of this book. They also provide investment-oriented products that we describe later in this chapter. In addition to their importance in a country, they are major players in the global financial markets with the concern that insurers pose a significant systemic risk and whether major insurers should be considered globally systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). We'll address this issue later in this chapter.

# Types of Insurance

Countries have different types of insurance policies that insurance companies may issue. The classification of insurance companies in the United States are life insurance, health insurance, property and casualty (P&C) insurance, liability insurance, umbrella insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance, and structured settlements.

# Life Insurance

For life insurance, the risk insured against is the death of the insured. The life insurance company pays the beneficiary of the life insurance policy in the event of the death of the insured. There are several types of life insurance policies, which will be examined later in this chapter.

# Health Insurance

In the case of health insurance, the risk insured is medical treatment of the insured. The health insurance company pays the insured (or the provider of the medical service) all or a portion of the cost of medical treatment by doctors, hospitals, or others. This type of insurance has undergone significant changes in the past two decades in many countries. As a result, the health industry has been significantly restructured, so that the largest health insurance companies specialize in health insurance rather than sell health insurance in addition to other products, such as life insurance.

# Property and Casualty Insurance

The risk insured against by a P&C insurance company is damage to various types of property. Specifically, it is insurance against financial loss caused by damage, destruction, or loss to property as the result of an identifiable event that is sudden, unexpected, or unusual. The major types of such insurance are (1) a house and its contents against such risks as fire, flood, earthquakes, and theft (homeowners insurance and its variants) and (2) a vehicle against collision, theft, and other damage (automobile insurance and its variants)

# Liability Insurance

With liability insurance, the risk insured against is litigation, or the risk of lawsuits against the insured due to actions by the insured or others. Liability insurance offers protection against third-party claims, that is, payment is usually made to someone who experiences a loss and who is not a party to the insurance contract, not to the insured.

# Umbrella Insurance

Typically, umbrella insurance is pure liability coverage over and above the coverage provided by all the policies beneath it, such as homeowner, automobile, and boat policies. The name "umbrella" refers to the fact that it covers liability claims of all the policies underneath it. In addition to providing liability coverage over the limits of the underlying policies, it provides coverage for claims that are excluded from other liability policies, such as invasion of privacy, libel, and false arrest. Typically, users of umbrella policies have a large amount of assets that would be placed at risk in the event of a catastrophic claim.

# Disability Insurance

Disability insurance insures against the inability of employed persons to earn an income in either their own occupation ("own occ" disability insurance) or any occupation ("any occ"). Typically, "own occ" disability insurance is written for professionals in white-collar occupations (often physicians and dentists) and "any occ" is for blue-collar workers. Another distinction in disability insurance is the sustainability of the policy, which can be of two types. The first is guaranteed renewable (or guaranteed continuable), whereby the issuer has to sustain the policy for the specified period of time, and the issuer cannot make any changes in the policy except to change the premium rates for the entire class of policy (but not for an individual policyholder). The other type is noncancelable and guaranteed renewable (or simply noncancelable), whereby the issuer has no right to make any change in any policy during the specified period. Disability insurance is also divided into short-term disability and long-term disability, with six months being the typical dividing time.

# Long-Term Care Insurance

As average life expectancies rise, older individuals have become concerned about outliving their assets and being unable to care for themselves as they age. In addition, custodial care for the aged has become very expensive and in many countries may not be covered by some form of government-provided insurance for the aged. Thus, demand has surged for insurance to provide custodial care for the aged who are no longer able to care for themselves. This care may be provided in either the insured's own residence or a separate custodial facility. Many types of long-term care insurance are available.

# Structured Settlements

Structured settlements are fixed, guaranteed periodic payments over a long period of time, typically resulting from a settlement on a disability policy or other type of insurance policy.

For example, suppose an individual is hit by an automobile and, as a result, is unable to work for the rest of his or her life. The individual may sue the P&C company for future lost earnings and medical care. To settle the suit, the P&C company may agree to make specified payments over time to the individual. The P&C company may then purchase a policy from a life insurance company to make the agreed-on payments.

# Fundamentals of the Insurance Industry

A major task for the insurers is deciding which applications for insurance they should accept and which ones to reject. The process of deciding which application to accept or reject is referred to as the underwriting process. The insurance company must also determine how much to charge for the insurance if it accepts the application. This activity is referred to as policy pricing.

Because insurance companies collect insurance premiums initially and make payments later when or if an insured event occurs, insurance companies maintain the premiums collected in an investment portfolio that generates a return. Thus, the two sources of income for insurance companies include the underwriting income (the insurance premium) and the investment income earned. The investment returns from the investment of the insurance premiums accumulate until the funds are paid out on the policy. The premium provides a fairly stable type of revenue. Investment returns may vary considerably with the performance of the investment strategy pursued by the insurer's management. Consequently, an insurance company's profits result from the difference between its revenue (i.e., insurance premiums collected plus investment returns) and its operating expenses and insurance payments or benefits. The type of risk insured against, which determines the level of premium collected and benefit paid, defines the insurance company.

A fundamental aspect of the insurance industry results from the relationship between its revenues and costs. A baker purchases ingredients, uses these ingredients to make assorted bakery products, and then sells those products, all in a fairly short time frame. Therefore, a bakery's profit margin can be relatively easily calculated. In contrast, an insurance company collects premium payments and invests them. The payments to a policyholder on the insurance policy occur later and, depending on the type of insurance, often in an unpredictable manner. Consequently, the payments are contingent on potential future events. For example, for life insurance, it is certain that everyone will die. However, it is not known when any specific individual will die. The timing of the payment on any specific insurance company that sells insurance on an individual's life is not known with certainty. Although the payments on any single life insurance policy are uncertain, actuaries can predict the pattern of deaths on a large portfolio of life insurance policies, making the aggregate much more predictable in terms of the patterns of death using standard actuarial tables.

At the other extreme, not only are payments on home insurance against hurricanes singularly uncertain, but the payments on a portfolio of homes remains uncertain as well. If one house in some geographical region is destroyed by a flood, it is likely that many other homes will also be destroyed. Thus, two important differences distinguish calculating the profitability of bread manufacturers and of insurance companies. The first is that the timing and magnitude of the payments are much less certain for an insurance company. The second is the long lag between the receipts and payments made by an insurance company, which introduces the importance of the investment portfolio and the generation of investment income.

These differences in the providers of a baked goods and insurance lead to differences in the way consumers of bread and insurance view their providers. Purchasers of baked goods are not harmed if the bakery goes bankrupt the day after they buy the baked goods. The purchaser of baked goods receives the product immediately, but the owner of an insurance policy receives a payment on the insurance policy in the future only if an insured event occurs, so the policy owner must be concerned about the continued viability of the insurance company. Therefore, the credit rating of an insurance company is important to a purchaser of insurance, especially for the types of insurance that may be paid well into the future.

# Structure of Insurance Companies

Based on the previous discussion, insurance companies are really a composite of three companies. First, there is the "home office" or actual insurance company. This company designs the insurance contract ("manufactures" the contract) and provides the backing for the financial guarantees on the contract, that is, assures the policyholder that the contract will pay off under the conditions of the contract. This company is called the manufacturer and guarantor of the insurance policy. Second, there is the investment component that invests the premiums collected in the investment portfolio. This is the investment company.

The third component of an insurance company is the distribution component or the sales force. Distribution forces come in different types. First, there are the agents who are associated with the company. Agents sell only or mainly the company's own manufactured products. These agents typically are not employees of the company (although some companies also use employees as salespeople) but are entrepreneurs financially associated with the company. There are also brokers who are not associated with any company but sell the insurance products of many companies. Brokers have traditionally operated individually but are increasingly operating in groups called producer groups. In many countries, changes in regulations have allowed commercial banks to become distributors of insurance products. We describe this bank insurance model later in this chapter. The Internet has also been used by some insurance companies to distribute insurance products directly to clients. Internet distribution is very new and has considerable potential but is still in its infancy. This mode of distribution has been most successful in the more commodity-like insurance products, such as term life insurance and automobile insurance.

These three components of insurance companies traditionally have been combined in one overall company, but they are increasingly being separated, and the three functions are being provided by different companies. First, as previously mentioned, many insurance companies use independent brokers or producer groups to distribute their products rather than use their own agents. Many companies no longer have their own agents and sell all their products exclusively through brokers, producer groups, or on the Internet. Second, insurance companies are increasingly outsourcing parts of their investment portfolio or even the entire portfolio to external independent investment managers. Investment managers are also increasingly diversifying, that is, not specializing in managing any one type of assets (such as pension fund assets, mutual funds, or insurance company assets) but are managing several or all of them. Third, although the home office component of an insurance company seems to be the core of the insurance company, some home offices use external actuarial firms to design their contracts. And, more importantly, they may reinsure some or all of the liabilities they incur in providing insurance.

# Reinsurance Companies

To reduce risk, insurance companies may reinsure some or all of the liabilities they incur in providing insurance. Companies established for that purpose are called reinsurance companies or reinsurers. According to the reinsurance transaction, the initial (primary) insurer transfers the risk of the insurance policy to the reinsurer. The guarantee on the insurance policy is thus provided by the reinsurer rather than by the primary insurance company.

The five largest reinsurers in the world are Munich Reinsurance Company; Swiss Reinsurance Company Limited; Hannover Re; Berkshire Hathaway Inc.; and Lloyd's. The two larger reinsurers in Asia are Korean Reinsurance Company and China Reinsurance (Group) Corporation.

# Captive Insurance Companies

In chapter 2, we described how a company may decide to retain certain risks. To insure against these risks, companies have established insurance companies that they wholly own. The insurance companies created for this purpose are referred to as captive insurance companies. These insurers provide their owners a form of self-insurance and can provide for insurance protection against any type of commercial risks that are provided for by P&C insurance companies, as well as life insurance. In the United States, the majority of Fortune 500 companies have established captive insurance companies. In recent years, smaller companies have also created captives. Worldwide there are about 5,000 captives. Even a government can set up a captive. For example, the government of China created captive and marine cargo specialties to establish captives for a few of its state-owned enterprises.

There are several types of captives. Some of the alternative captives are single-parent captives, association captives, industry captives, and diversified captives. Most captives are single-parent captives—the captives provide pure self-insurance for the parent company that created them. Association captives are created by a trade association or members of an industry to provide insurance coverage for their members. Typically, association captives insure against liability risks, such as medical malpractice lawsuits. When companies in the same industry jointly create a captive to deal with a specific insurance problem faced by the industry, the captives created are referred to as industry captives. Captives that underwrite unrelated risks in addition to the parent company's business are referred to as diversified captives.

There are legal jurisdictions where most captives have been domiciled outside of the home country of the company or association creating the captive. These legal jurisdictions offer favorable tax laws, as well as requirements regarding capitalization requirements, investment restrictions, fees, and financial reporting requirements. The major ones are Anguilla, Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Ireland (Dublin), Guernsey, Isle of Man, and Luxembourg. In the United States, states have developed their own regulations regarding captives for medical insurance as a result of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as "Obamacare").

Stock versus Mutual Insurance Companies

Focusing on the United States, the two major forms of insurance companies are stock and mutual. A stock company is similar in structure to any corporation or public company. Shares (of ownership) are owned by independent shareholders and are traded publicly. The shareholders care only about the performance of their shares (i.e., the stock appreciation and the dividends). Their holding period, and thus their view, may be short term. The insurance policies are simply the products or business of the company, and management is evaluated in terms of performance.

In contrast, a mutual company has no stock and no external owners. The policyholders are the owners. The owners, that is, the policyholders, care primarily or even solely about the performance on their insurance policies, notably the company's ability to pay on the policy. Because these payments may occur considerably into the future, the policyholders' view may be long term. Thus, whereas stock companies answer to two constituencies (their stockholders and policyholders), mutual companies deal with only one, because their policyholders and their owners are the same.

The reason for the existence of both forms of insurance structures has been examined by economists. Organizational theory is the field in management that tries to identify the organizational structure that provides the most effective solution to the risk that a firm's managers will seek to make decisions based on their own self-interest at the expense of the firm's owners. This is the principal-agent problem in financial economics: Agents in the form of managers act in their own interest rather than that of the principals in the form of owners of the company. One study that has looked at the reason for the existence of the two structures for life insurance companies notes the following:

The coexistence of stock and mutual companies in the property-casualty insurance industry suggests that at least one of three hypotheses is true: the two organizational forms have competing advantages; the market may be rich enough that different organizational forms can survive in different niches; and the market may not have reached its final equilibrium (or perhaps history may influence the equilibrium).

At one time in the United States, the largest insurers operated as mutual companies, but a number of mutual companies have converted to stock companies, a process referred to as demutualization. The motivation for demutualization is the need to obtain funding to support growth. When a mutual company converts to a stock company, shares can be sold to the public to raise funds, and stock can be used as currency to acquire or merge with other insurance companies.

# Types of Life Insurance Policies

Table 8.1 shows the five largest life companies in the United State, Europe, and Asia as measured by total assets. Although different types of life insurance policies are sold in different countries, we focus our description on policies sold in the United States. For this reason, it is important to understand the impact of the U.S. tax code on certain types of insurance production. The U.S. tax code allows for favorable tax treatment of certain types of life insurance policies that have an investment feature. Specifically, the buildup of investment income from certain types of policies is not taxed. Neither is the beneficiary of the death benefit of a life insurance policy subject to an income tax. Finally, the death benefit of the policy may or may not be subject to estate tax, depending on how the beneficiary status is structured. Consequently, life insurance products offer considerable tax advantages.

The two fundamentally different types of life insurance are term insurance and cash value life insurance. In addition, other investment-oriented products are sold by life insurers.

# Term Insurance

Term insurance is pure life insurance. If the insured dies while the policy is intact, the beneficiary of the policy receives the death benefit. If the insured does not die within the designated period, the policy is invalid and holds no value. No cash value or investment value accrues to a term insurance policy. In addition, the policyholder cannot borrow against the policy.

# Cash Value or Permanent Life Insurance

A broad classification of life insurance includes cash value or permanent or investment-type life insurance, usually called "whole life insurance."2 In addition to providing pure life insurance (as does term insurance), whole life insurance builds up a cash value or investment value inside the policy. This cash value can be withdrawn and can also be borrowed against by the owner of the policy. Or, if the owner wishes to let the policy lapse, he or she can withdraw the cash value. Growth in the cash value of the life insurance policy is referred to as the "inside buildup." A major advantage of this and other insurance products that offer a cash or investment value is that the inside buildup is not subject to taxation.

Life insurance products can be complex. Only an overview is provided in this chapter. The first of the two categories of cash value life insurance policies discretizes whether the cash value is guaranteed or variable. The second category deals with whether the required premium payment is fixed or flexible. The four possible combinations, shown in table 8.2, are discussed here.

Table 8.2 Classification of cash value insurance.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Guaranteed Cash Value Policies</td><td>Variable Life Policies</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed premium</td><td>Whole life insurance</td><td>Variable life insurance</td></tr><tr><td>Flexible premium</td><td>Universal life insurance</td><td>Variable universal life insurance</td></tr></table>

Guaranteed cash value life insurance Traditional cash value life insurance, whole life insurance, provides a guaranteed buildup of cash value based on the general account portfolio of the insurance company. The insurance company guarantees a minimum cash value at the end of each year. This guaranteed cash value is based on a minimum dividend paid on the policy. In addition, the policy can be either participating or nonparticipating policies, the dividend and the cash value on the policy are the guaranteed amounts. For participating policies, the dividend paid on the policy is based on the realized actuarial experience of the company and its investment portfolio.

The cash value may be above but not below the guaranteed level for participating policies. Thus, the actual performance of the policy can be substantially affected by the actual policy dividends over the guaranteed amount.

Variable life insurance Unlike the guaranteed or fixed cash value policies, which are based on the general account portfolio of the insurance company, variable life insurance policies allow the policy owners, within limits, to allocate their premium payments among separate investment accounts maintained by the insurance company and also to shift the policy cash value among the separate accounts. As a result, the amount of the policy cash value and the death benefit depend on the investment results of the separate accounts selected by the policy owner. Thus, this policy offers no guaranteed cash value or death benefit, which depends instead on the performance of the selected investment portfolio.

The types of separate account investment options offered vary by insurance company. Typically, the insurance company offers a selection of common stock and bond fund investment opportunities, managed by the company itself and other investment managers. If the investment options perform well, the cash value buildup in the policy will be significant. However, if the policyholder selects investment options that perform poorly, the variable life insurance policy will perform poorly, resulting in little or no cash value buildup, or, in the worst case, the termination of the policy.

Universal life and variable universal life insurance The key element of universal life insurance is the flexibility of the premium for the policyholder. This flexible premium concept separates pure insurance protection (term insurance) from the investment (cash value) element of the policy. The policy cash value is set up as the cash value fund (or accumulation fund), to which the investment income is credited and from which the cost of term insurance for the insured (the mortality charge) is debited. Expenses are also debited.

This separation of the cash value from the pure insurance is called the unbundling of the traditional life insurance policy. Premium payments for universal life are at the discretion of the policyholder, except for a minimum initial premium to begin the coverage and then at least enough cash value in the policy each month to cover the mortality charge and other expenses. If not covered, the policy will lapse. Both guaranteed cash value and variable life can be written on a flexibleor a fixed-premium basis.

Life insurers increasingly offer products with a significant investment component in addition to their insurance component: guaranteed investment contracts and annuities.

Guaranteed investment contracts Insurance companies have increasingly sold products that have a significant investment component in addition to their insurance component. The first major investment-oriented product developed by life insurance companies was the guaranteed investment contract (GIC). According to a GIC, a life insurance company agrees, in return for a single premium, to pay the principal amount and a predetermined annual crediting rate over the life of the investment, all paid at the maturity date of the GIC. For example, a 10 million, five-year GIC with a predetermined crediting rate of 10\% means that at the end of five years, the insurance company pays the guaranteed crediting rate and the principal. The risk to the customer is that the return of the principal depends on the ability of the life insurance company to satisfy the obligation, just as in any corporate debt obligation. The risk that the insurer faces is that the rate earned on the portfolio of supporting assets is less than the guaranteed rate paid to the customer.

The maturity of a GIC can vary from one year to 20 years. The interest rate guaranteed depends on market conditions and the rating of the life insurance company. The interest rate will be higher than the yield of the country's risk-free rate for the same maturity. These policies are purchased by individuals and by pension plan sponsors as a pension investment and, as explained in chapter 9, by one type of pension fund, a defined pension fund, to "derisk" their obligations.

A GIC is nothing more than the debt obligation of the life insurance company issuing the contract. The word "guarantee" does not mean that there is a guarantor other than the life insurance company. Effectively, a GIC is a zero-coupon bond issued by a life insurance company and, as such, exposes the investor to the same credit risk. This credit risk has been highlighted by the default of several major issuers of GICs. The two most publicized in the United States were Mutual Benefit, a New Jersey-based insurer, and Executive Life, a California-based insurer, which were both seized by regulators in 1991.

Annuity Another insurance company investment product is an annuity. In the United States, an annuity is often described as "a mutual fund in an insurance wrapper." (Mutual funds are discussed in chapter 32.) What does this mean? To answer this question, assume that an insurance company investment manager has two identical common stock portfolios, one in a mutual fund and the other in an annuity. For the mutual fund, all income (that is, the dividend) is taxable, and the capital gains (or losses) realized by the fund are also taxable, although at potentially different tax rates. The income and realized gains are taxable whether they are withdrawn by the mutual fund holder or reinvested in the fund. There are no guarantees associated with the mutual fund; its performance depends solely on the portfolio performance.

Because of the insurance wrapper, discussed below, an annuity in the United States is treated as an insurance product; as a result, it receives preferential tax treatment. Specifically, the income and realized gains are not taxable if not withdrawn from the annuity product. Thus, the "inside buildup" of returns is not taxable on an annuity, as it is also true for other cash value insurance products. At the time of withdrawal, however, all the gains are taxed at ordinary income rates.

The insurance wrapper on the mutual fund that makes it an annuity can be of various forms. The most common wrapper is the guarantee by the insurance company that the annuity policyholder will get back no less than the amount invested in the annuity (there may also be a minimum period before withdrawal to get this benefit). Thus, if an investor invests  \$100 in a common stock-based annuity, and at the time of withdrawal (or at the time of death of the annuity holder) the annuity has a value of only\$ 95, the insurance company will pay the annuity holder (or its beneficiary) 100. Many other types of protection or insurance features have also been developed.

Of course, insurance companies impose a charge for this insurance benefit—an insurance premium for the insurance component of the annuity.

Thus, whereas mutual funds have an expense fee imposed on the fund's performance, an annuity has a mortality and expense fee imposed. Therefore, annuities are more expensive to the investor than are mutual funds. In return, annuity policyholders get the insurance wrapper, which provides the tax benefit. Annuities can be either fixed annuities (similar to GICs) or variable annuities whose performance is based on the return of a common stock or bond portfolio.

# General Account and Separate Account Products

The general account of an insurance company refers to the investment portfolio of the overall company. Products "written by the company itself" generally carry a "general account guarantee," that is, they are a liability of the insurance company. When the credit rating agencies (e.g., Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch) provide a credit rating, they do so on products written or guaranteed by the general account. Such ratings are on the claims-paying ability of the company. Typical products written or guaranteed by the general account are whole life, universal life, and fixed annuities (including GICs). Insurance companies must support the guaranteed performance of their general account products to the extent of their solvency.

Other types of insurance products receive no guarantee from the insurer's general account, and their performance is not based on the performance of the insurance company's general account but solely on the performance of an account separate from the general account, often an account selected by the policyholder. These products are called separate account products. Variable life insurance and variable annuities are separate account products. The policyholder chooses specific portfolios to support these products. The performance of the insurance product depends almost solely on the performance of the portfolio selected, adjusted for the fees or expenses of the insuring company.

Participating policies The performance of separate account products depends on the performance of the separate account portfolio chosen and is not affected by the performance of the overall insurance company's general account portfolio. In addition, the performance of some general account products is not affected by the performance of the general account portfolio. For example, disability income insurance policies may be written on a general account, and even though their payoff depends on the solvency of the general account, the policy performance (e.g., its premium) does not participate in the investment performance of the insurance company's general account investment portfolio.

Other general account insurance products participate in the performance of the company's general account investment portfolio. For example, a life insurance company provides the guarantee of a minimum dividend on its whole life policies, but the policies' actual dividends may increase if the investment portfolio performs well. This "interest component" of the dividend exists in tandem with the expense and mortality components. Thus, the performance of the insurance policy participates in the overall company's performance. Such a policy is called a participating policy, in this case, a participating whole life insurance policy.

Captive Reinsurance Arrangements by Life Insurers

Earlier we described captive insurance companies. Although the original captives were created by noninsurance entities, life insurers have been creating captives to circumvent some recent regulatory requirements. In contrast to the use of captives by noninsurance entities for providing a form of self-insurance, captives owned by life insurers are simply risk transfer vehicles for a given life insurer. The structures created by life insurers are referred to as reinsurance captives, even though the risk is not transferred to an independent insurer. As a result, there has been considerable debate about such captives. In a report by the New York State Department of Financial Services published in June 2013, they are referred to as "shadow insurance" arrangements, because they hide the financial weakness of the sponsoring life insurer and increase the broader financial system's systemic risk.

There are two views on the use by life insurers of captive reinsurance arrangements. One view is that captive reinsurance arrangements are an efficient vehicle for a life insurer to manage statutory capital for some its products. The benefit to the consumer is that it results in lower premiums than would be possible in the absence of such an arrangement and more insurance protection without the insurer increasing the risk of insolvency. The other view is that insolvency risk is significantly higher for life insurers using a captive reinsurance arrangement than implied by the parent insurer's current credit ratings, producing a substantial expected cost of default for the industry. This view is supported by an empirical study by Koijen and Yogo. $^4$

# Regulation of Insurance Companies

Every country has its own system for regulating insurers. In fact, even within a country, regional regulators may have their own regulatory system. The United States is the prime example of this, with each state regulating insurance companies. In the European Union, every member country has its own regulatory system.

# International Association of Insurance Supervisors

Before describing the U.S. insurance regulatory system, it is worthwhile to describe global efforts to regulate the insurance industry. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors is a voluntary membership organization representing insurance regulators and supervisors from 140 countries that make up  $97\%$  of the world's insurance premiums. Formed in 1994, the two objectives of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors are to

- Promote effective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance industry in order to develop and maintain fair, safe and stable insurance markets for the benefit and protection of policyholders; and to
- Contribute to global financial stability.5

Three activities are undertaken by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors to achieve its objectives. The first activity is to establish principles, standards, and guidance for effective insurance supervision. The second is to promote the implementation of its supervisory principles and standards by international organizations, regional groups, and supervisors. The third is to play a key role in financial stability issues, which includes developing a methodology for the identification of global systemically important insurers and policy measures to address their systemic risks.

One of the principal objectives of regulation of insurers is to reduce the risk of insolvency. So we begin with a brief history of reasons for failures of insurers, limiting our discussion to U.S. insurers.

# Reasons for Failures of Insurers

For insurers, failure means to (1) default, (2) be liquidated, (3) be taken over by regulators, or (4) obtain external support to avoid the first three kinds of failure. The causes of failure were reported in a study by Standard & Poor's in an effort to improve on the way in which the rating company formulates its criteria for rating insurers.[6] The study, which looked at failure since the 1980s throughout the world, found that the following key factors were present:

- poor liquidity management, underpricing and underreserving,
- a high tolerance for investment risk, management and governance issues,
- difficulties related to rapid growth and/or expansion into noncore activities, and sovereign-related risks.7

The first two factors listed were the principal reasons for the failure of U.S. insurers.

Poor liquidity management led to the failure of some U.S. life insurance companies from 1991 to 1994, including First Executive Corporation, Executive Life Insurance Company of California, First Capital Holdings Corporation, Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, Monarch Life Insurance Company, Kentucky Central Life Insurance Company, and Confederation Life Insurance Company. The liquidity problem for these failed companies arose from an overconcentration in illiquid assets that could not be used to satisfy the insurer's liabilities.

The overconcentration in illiquid assets for some of the failed life insurers were:

- Mutual Benefit: real estate developments;
- Executive Life Insurance Company: illiquid high-yield bonds and hybrid capital securities;
- Monarch Life: Real estate equity investments; and
- Kentucky Central and Confederation: mortgage loans on commercial real estate, including construction loans on new developments and high loan-to-value mortgages.

The liquidity issue faced by these life insurers was much like the run-on-the-bank scenario faced by depository institutions.

Liquidity-driven problems were also faced in 1999 by life insurers that issued GIC policies, which we described earlier. As explained, most GIC products allow policyholders to surrender or cash out their policy. The surrender rate for GICs was so high in 1999 that it led to the failure of five life insurers: GenAmerica Financial Corporation, General American Life Insurance Company, ARM Financial Group Inc., Integrity Life Insurance Company, and RGA Reinsurance Company.

From 1984 to 1989, several U.S. insurers, mostly P&C insurers, became insolvent for the second reason listed: the loss reserves proved deficient following a period of inadequate pricing. The insurers included Mission Insurance Company and Transit Casualty Insurance Company.

Of course, there were also the "near misses"—instances in which external support prevented the collapse of an insurer. The best-known case of external support was the federal government's bailout of the American International Group (AIG). AIG had followed an overly aggressive investment strategy using the leverage provided by credit derivatives, a derivative product described in chapter 39. We described the 2008 federal government bailout of AIG in chapter 2.

# U.S. Regulatory System

Regulation of U.S. insurers is governed by the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, which grants states the right to regulate the business of insurance.

There is a state-based regulatory system of insurers. Insurance companies whose stock is publicly traded are also regulated by the SEC.

Although the primary insurance regulators are at the state level, the federal government is also involved. The main involvement relates to federal programs for dealing with risks that are difficult for private insurance companies to insure.

The current state-based regulatory system All states have an insurance department that is either part of a state financial regulatory department or an independent state agency. The head of the insurance regulatory department, typically referred to as the insurance commissioner, is either appointed by the state's governor or elected. For example, in the state of Michigan, the regulatory agency responsible for insurance (as well as for banking and securities markets) is the Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation, which is part of that state's Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth, and the commissioner is appointed by the governor. In the state of New York, the Insurance Division is part of that state's Department of Financial Services. Before October 2011, New York State had a stand-alone agency, the New York State Insurance Department. The state's Department of Financial Services was formed by combining the New York State Insurance Department and the New York State Banking Department.

Insurance regulation deals with solvency regulation and consumer protection. Solvency regulation is the same as what we discussed in chapter 6 with respect to bank regulation—safety and soundness regulation. State laws regarding solvency regulation deal with (1) capital requirements and reserves, (2) permissible investments, and (3) general and separate accounts. Licensing of and standards of conduct for participants in the insurance business and the approval of products developed by insurers are the focus of consumer protection regulation.

The relationship between the premium revenues and the eventual contingent contractual insurance policy payments bears on an important aspect of evaluating insurance companies. Accountants and auditors, credit rating agencies, and government regulators all monitor insurance companies. These monitors watch the financial stability of the insurance companies based on, among other things, the level of synchronicity between the premiums and insurance policy payments and also the volatility of the payments. To ensure an insurer's financial stability, these monitors require insurance companies to maintain reserves or surplus, consisting of the excess of assets over liabilities. Regulators and accountants define these reserves or surpluses differently and refer to them by different names. Because state statutes establish the treatment of both assets and liabilities for insurance companies, a surplus is also known as statutory surplus (or reserves), or STAT surplus. Generally accepted accounting principles surplus (or reserves) is defined by accountants for their purposes. Statutory and GAAP reserves are measured differently, but their purposes are similar, though not identical. Statutory surplus is important because regulators view it as the ultimate amount that can be drawn on to pay policyholders. The growth of this surplus for an insurance company also determines how much future business it can underwrite.

Defining assets is straightforward; defining liabilities is more difficult. The complication in determining the value of liabilities arises because the insurance company commits to making payments at some time in the future, and those future payments are recorded as contingent liabilities on its financial statement. The reserves are simply an accounting entry, not an identifiable portfolio.

Model laws and regulations are developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a private voluntary association composed of state insurance commissioners. Adoption of a model law or regulation by the NAIC is not binding on any state. However, states typically use these guidelines when writing their own laws and regulations. The NAIC seeks to foster uniformity of regulation, the lack of which in the current system has drawn major criticism and provided one of the arguments for moving primary regulation from the states to the federal government. Although the adoption of model laws is not binding, the NAIC does have some power granted to it by every state and by the federal government. For example, every state has adopted a law that requires insurers to file financial statements prepared on forms developed by the

NAIC and to use the NAIC's calculation methodology to compute risk-based capital requirements.

Insurance companies are typically rated by credit rating agencies (e.g., Moody's, Standard & Poor's, A. M. Best Company, Fitch) with respect to both their ability to pay claims and their outstanding debt, if any. Equity analysts who work at investment banks and broker-dealers also evaluate the attractiveness of the outstanding common stock of publicly traded insurance companies.

Current and potential regulation by the federal government As with depository institutions, regulators impose capital requirements on insurance companies. As just explained, in the case of insurers, capital requirements are set by state regulators; consequently, capital requirements vary by state. This is in stark contrast to the regulatory framework dealing with insurers in other countries, developed and emerging, where regulation takes place at the national level. Moreover, there is no actual authority or governmental power requiring states regulators to act on the NAIC model laws and regulations.

Proposals have been made to change the current system of regulation at the state level and to add greater regulation at the federal level, making a federal agency the lead insurance regulator. The argument for doing so is that it could eliminate regulatory inconsistencies across states. Proponents point out that this form of regulation would allow coordination with other federal agencies, such as the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC. Proponents of the current system of state regulations point to the stellar performance of insurers during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Whereas federally regulated banks required a bailout, with the exception of the American International Group, whose actions required a government bailout (described in chapter 2), the insurance industry fared well.

The need for regulatory reform of the insurance industry was recognized by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which took the first step toward federal oversight. Title V (Insurance) of this act established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) as a branch of the Treasury Department. The FIO is responsible for all insurance except health care and most long-term care. The FIO was given limited authority to eliminate duplicative state regulation, coordinate with international authorities on insurance matters, and to report to Congress on attributes of the current U.S. regulatory system and how it could be modernized.

In executing its charge to assess and recommend ways to modernize insurance regulations, the FIO drew on a 2011 study titled "Modernizing Insurance Regulation in the United States,"[8] popularly referred to as the Cluff Fund Report. The recommendations in that report dealt with the problems inherent in the current state-based system, which was described as "fragmented, inconsistent and inefficient" and something that could only be dealt with by regulation at the federal level. The near-term recommendations for changes in the regulatory structure are for a better coordinating role for the FIO and improvements to state regulations. The midto long-term recommendations for a regulatory framework for national standards are the following:

- Keep the existing state-based regulatory framework, but foster through state action more uniform national standards.
- Establish federally enforced state "passports," whereby states would be limited in their ability to refuse recognition of an insurer domiciled in another state.
- Establish direct federal oversight and regulation of insurance.

# EU Regulatory Approach

The first insurance regulations for members of the European Union were enacted in 1994. The primary concern of the regulation was protecting consumers by focusing on insurance products and pricing policies. Solvency was not officially addressed by the EU legislative program, Solvency I Directive, which sought to harmonize the insurance regulatory regime for EU members.

On January 1, 2016, the European Union adopted new regulations, Solvency II Directive, that replaced 14 insurance directives. The principal objectives of the Solvency II Directive (in addition to providing enhanced consumer protection) are to give policyholders greater confidence in the products of insurers, harmonize regulatory regimes, and modernize supervision. The "Supervisory Review Process" required by the Solvency II Directive shifts the focus of regulators from compliance monitoring and capital to evaluating the risk profiles and the quality of insurers' risk management and governance systems. Thus, the Solvency II Directive was not just about capital requirements for insurers but also about authorization, corporate governance, supervisory reporting, public disclosure, risk assessment and management, and solvency and capital reserves.

When comparing the EU and U.S. approaches to insurance regulations, the authors of one study argue that the EU approach is more "fluid and principles-based" than the approach taken by the United States.[9] By a "flexible" approach, the authors mean that risk-based capital standards imposed on insurers are used as guidelines for insurers rather than as absolute standards.[10] By providing greater flexibility, it is argued that insurers can develop strategies to deal with risk that can reduce the possibility of the insurance industry adding to systemic risk. Moreover, the authors of the study point out that the EU approach has been more successful in promoting an insurance industry that is financially strong according to empirical studies.

# Insurers and Global SIFIs

There has been a debate as to whether the importance of large insurers can cause systemic risk events that adversely impact a country's financial market or even the global financial market. The potential for insurers to create systemic risk events was brought to light by one major life insurer, America International Group (AIG), because of its losses in the financial derivatives markets, more specifically, credit default swaps (the subject of chapter 39).

A report by the Geneva Association consists of several papers on the differences between banks and insurers and what the differences mean for systemic risk and other implications for regulators.[11] Despite both banks and insurers being financial intermediaries willing to accept the transfer of risks from other market participants, the risks faced by banks and insurance companies differ. In discussing the role of banks and their activities in chapter 6, we will see that two of the major risks that banks accept are credit risk resulting from their lending activities and liquidity risk due to the mismatch between borrowing short term and lending long term. These two risks can result in difficulties for one major bank that can spill over to another bank, causing a "run on banks." Avoiding such runs is one of the motivations for bank deposit insurance and regulation of banks. This is not the nature of the risks faced by insurers in their core business activities. Hence the argument is that the insurance industry is not prone to systemic risk.

Support for this view is provided in a report of the Group of Thirty, an international body of leading experts in finance and economics, whose mission is to study economic and financial issues facing the global economy.[12] The authors of the study conclude that even under stress conditions, with respect to insurance companies, it would be "unlikely to cause widespread insolvencies in the primary insurance market and would have only a limited effect on the financial system and the real economy generally."[13] Harrington's study of the bailout of AIG by the federal government concluded that the financial problems of that insurer were not the result of the insurance products it sold but of its trading activities in a financial derivative product and its securities lending program.[14]

Several studies have investigated whether insurers pose systemic risk. None have found that to be the case. For example, investigating the issue of whether U.S. insurers have the potential to cause systemic risk for the U.S. economy, Cummins and Weiss looked at (1) the primary indicators that determine whether insurers are systemically risky and (2) the contributing factors that add to the vulnerability of the economy to systemic risk.[15] Although the principal conclusion reached by the authors is that no systemic risk is posed by U.S. insurers' core activities, the study did identify potential concerns. They find that both life insurers and property-casualty insurers are vulnerable to reinsurance crises and that life insurers are vulnerable to intrasector crises. Noncore activities, such as financial guarantees and derivatives trading, may cause systemic risk. Cummins and Weiss conclude that to reduce systemic risk that might result from noncore activities, efforts to strengthen mechanisms for insurance group supervision must be continued.

# Catastrophic Risk and Its Management

Insurers face extreme risks or catastrophic risk in their business, or what is also referred to as "tail risk." The types of events and the resulting payout by the insurer can threaten solvency. That is, the insurer may not have sufficient capital to satisfy the claims of all policyholders. For P&C insurers, catastrophic risk encompasses the potential damages associated with natural disasters (hurricanes, windstorms, and earthquakes). In the case of life insurers, the catastrophic risks are extreme mortality risk or longevity risk, depending on the life insurance product.

Extreme Mortality Risk and Longevity Risk

Extreme mortality risk is the risk of an extreme event leading to more deaths than predicted from a mortality table. Extreme mortality events include disease-related deaths, natural catastrophe-related deaths (e.g., earthquakes, floods), war-related deaths, or terrorism-related deaths.[16] Because of their impact on the global population, disease-related events appear to be the main extreme mortality event faced by life insurers. An influenza pandemic is considered the most serious disease-related event. Extreme mortality risk is a concern for pure life insurance products, because death benefits must be paid out sooner than expected when the insurer established the policy premium.

In contrast, longevity risk is the risk of policyholders living longer than expected when the cost of the insurance (the premium) was established. This occurs when mortality rates decrease. Longevity risk is the risk associated with investment products, such as annuities. The longer a policyholder lives, the greater the payout will be relative to what it was expected to be when the premium was determined. Longevity risk is a concern not only for annuity-type products offered by life insurers but also for defined benefit plans.

Although insurance companies are risk bearers, these institutional investors have pursued strategies to share risks using reinsurance. Other catastrophic risk management strategies involve structured finance technology, described in chapter 27, to create catastrophe bonds (nicknamed "cat bonds") issued by insurers that can provide them with a level of protection against catastrophic risk that may not be available in the reinsurance market.

The securities created by life insurance companies and P&C insurance companies to transfer catastrophic risk are called insurance-linked securities. These securities, which are issued by insurers, provide a good example of the convergence between the insurance industry and the financial markets using structured finance technology. We do not cover structured finance here. Instead, we just discuss one type of insurance-linked securities, catastrophe bonds.[17]

Cat bonds are issued by P&C insurers and reinsurers for the purpose of transferring catastrophic risk. In some ways, they are structured like standard bonds: they have a maturity value, a maturity date, and an interest rate. They differ from a standard bond in that if losses of the insurer (i.e., the bond issuer) exceed a specified amount, the amount paid to the bondholder at the maturity date is reduced. A formula specifies how much less the maturity value will be based on the excess loss. The incentive for investors to purchase cat bonds is that the interest rates they offer exceed those of otherwise similar bonds with the same credit rating.

Cat bonds were first issued in 1996, triggered by two super catastrophes in the United States: Hurricane Andrew (category 5), which struck South Florida and Louisiana in 1992, causing an estimated  \$26 billion in damage, and the 1994 earthquake (magnitude 6.7) in Northridge, California, which caused\$ 15 to 20 billion in damage. For the first cat bond issue, the interest rate was 400 basis points higher than that paid by otherwise comparable bonds. That is, for the risk of losing some or part of the principal at the maturity date, investors in the first cat bond received compensation of 4\% per year above what otherwise comparable bonds offered.

Life insurers issue catastrophe mortality bonds that are structured such that the payment depends on the change in a designated mortality index. For that mortality index, there is a base mortality index set. If at the maturity date the mortality index exceeds that base mortality index, then the principal amount paid at issuance is a reduced amount that is determined by a specified formula. The first catastrophe mortgage bond issued was in late 2003 by the reinsurer Swiss Reinsurance Group (Vita Capital Ltd.).

# Insurance Company Investment Strategies

In general, the characteristics of insurance company investment portfolios should reflect their liabilities, that is, the insurance products they underwrite. There are many differences among the various types of insurance policies. Among them are the following:

- the expected time at which the average payment will be made by the insurance company (technically, the "duration" of the payments); and
- the statistical or actuarial accuracy of estimates of when the event insured against will occur and the amount of the payment (that is, the overall risk of the policy).

In addition, the taxes vary across different types of insurance policies and companies.

The key distinction between life insurance and P&C insurance companies lies in the difficulty of projecting whether a policyholder will be paid off and how much the payment will be. Although this is no easy task for either a life or a P&C insurance company, it is easier from an actuarial perspective for a life insurance company. The amount and timing of claims on P&C insurance companies are more difficult to predict because of the randomness of natural catastrophes and the unpredictability of court awards in liability cases. This uncertainty about the timing and amount of cash outlays to satisfy claims has an impact on the investment strategies of the funds of P&C insurance companies compared to life insurance companies.

Without investigating the details for the differences in the portfolios of different types of insurance products, the major differences in the portfolios of life companies and P&C companies are as follows. Life companies on average have less common stock, more private placements, more commercial mortgages, fewer municipal bonds, and longer maturity bonds.

(These securities and financial assets are discussed in later chapters.) The difference in municipal bond holdings is due to the tax-exempt characteristic of these securities. The larger holdings of private placements and commercial mortgages indicate the yield orientation of life companies. This yield orientation is also consistent with the low holding of common stock for life insurance companies.

# Insurance Company Expansion into Other Financial Services

In many countries, the regulators of the insurance industry have given increased latitude to insurers to sell noninsurance products or provide financial services traditionally supplied by other financial institutions (such as banks and investment banks). Here we describe three ways that insurance companies have expanded into other financial services for individuals and businesses.

# Bank Insurance Model

As just explained, the distribution channels of insurance companies have been changing. One of the major changes involves some sort of relationship between a bank and an insurance company. Banks are averse to manufacturing insurance products because of their inexperience and regulatory issues; the risk borne by manufacturing insurance products; and the long payback period of some insurance products. However, insurance companies are attracted by the commercial bank customer base. As a result, commercial bank distribution of insurance company products has grown considerably. This bank insurance model is called "bancassurance."

The arrangements made between banks and insurance companies can be (1) a strategic alliance arrangement, (2) a mixed arrangement, or (3) a full integration model. With a strategic alliance, the relation involves solely the bank marketing a company's insurance products. The mixed arrangement calls for all marketing to be performed by the insurance company with the bank's only duty being to provide leads from its customer base. The full integration arrangement involves the bank using its own insurance brand and providing customized solutions to its customers for their financial needs. Banks would also require insurance regulatory approvals. The bank's activities associated with the full integration arrangement are the marketing of insurance and servicing of claims.

Depending on the type of bank insurance arrangement, the benefits to the bank are:[18]

- The potential to reduce reliance on interest rate spreads (particularly during low interest rate periods), increase income, and obtain a more stable stream of income by diversifying into insurance.
- Offer a wide range of financial services to current bank clients and by doing so increase customer retention.
- Improve integration of financial services provided to customers tailored to their life cycle.
- Capitalize on the bank's customer base.
- Get access to funds that would otherwise be invested with life insurers, who sometimes benefit from tax advantage.

From the perspective of an insurance company, the following are potential benefits, depending on the type of arrangement:

- Reduce reliance on the use of traditional agents to sell their products by making use of the channels owned by the bank partner.
- Obtain access to the bank partner's customer base.
- Jointly develop new financial products with the bank partner and market those products via the bank network rather than a network of agents.
- Share the cost of servicing policies with the bank partner.
- Use the partner bank's capital to improve the insurer's solvency and expand business.

From a regulatory perspective, the integration of banks and insurers is challenging. The favorable impact is that the diversification offered by the bank insurance model may lower systemic risk, because it potentially (1) reduces the volatility of bank income and (2) provides insurers with access to additional capital that improves solvency.

In the United States, the bank insurance model was permitted following the repeal in 1999 of a restriction on banks to use this model (i.e., the Glass-Steagall Act). In contrast, Bancassurance has long been a practice in Europe and by 2007 had made significant penetration in many European countries, particularly France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.[19] In such developing countries as Brazil and Malaysia, there has been significant use of Bancassurance. China had no restrictions on selling non-life policies but that was not the case for life insurance. The Chinese government removed several regulatory obstacles impeding the adoption of Bancassurance in 2003.

Pension Funds and Insurance Companies

At one time, three distinct types of products were available for individuals: insurance, savings/investment, and retirement. The specific products in each distinguishable category were as follows. Insurance products included term life and whole life. Savings/investment products included stocks, bonds, and collective vehicles (such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds). Private retirement products included defined benefit and defined contribution plans (provided by employers and the subject of chapter 4), and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) (provided by investment companies).

Over the past three decades, many products have been developed that fit into two or even three of these categories. Into which of these three categories, for example, does an IRA sold to a customer by a life insurance agent fit? Arguably, the correct answer to this question is all three categories. Figure 8.1 provides a summary of some of the products on the insurance/savings/retirement spectrum, which are really hybrids. We have discussed the various insurance products in this chapter. Retirement products are discussed in chapter 4. Mutual funds and other collective investment products are discussed in chapter 32. This section discusses products that are hybrid retirement and savings products but are often manufactured and distributed by insurance companies.

In the United States, the products that are a hybrid of retirement and investment products and are often distributed by insurance companies and agents are 401(k)s, Roth 401(k)s, and variable annuities. These products are also often distributed by many insurers, and the insurance companies often include some of their own products in these categories. Because these plans are retirement plans, they have tax advantages for the investor.

# Insurance-Based Investment Banking

As will be explained throughout this book, many of the financial risks faced by participants in the capital markets are being transferred from financial institutions to the public market. We will see in later chapters how this transfer has been done via the securitization mechanism. In the insurance industry, debt instruments (such as bonds) have been created allowing businesses and governments that need protection against the occurrence of certain events to go directly to the capital market to obtain that protection through the public issuance of securities rather than by purchasing traditional insurance. That is, rather than an insurance company absorbing the risk of some event, an entity that needs insurance protection can issue a bond whose payoff at the bond's maturity date depends on whether an adverse event occurs and the amount of the loss if it does. The compensation to investors who purchase the bond is a higher interest rate than on an otherwise comparable bond.

The area of finance in which publicly issued securities are used as a substitute for traditional insurance policies is referred to as insurance-based investment banking. Two examples help illustration how the public markets (here the bond market) can be used to circumvent traditional insurance.

For our first example, consider the operator of Tokyo Disneyland, Oriental Land Company. In 1999, the company issued  \$200 million of bonds to insure against the risk of a Tokyo earthquake. We have already discussed earlier cat bonds issued by a P&C insurer or reinsurers, which were the first such bonds issued by a noninsurance company. There were two issues of five-year bonds sold with a maturity value of\$ 100 million each. For investors in the first bond issue, the entire principal and interest would be lost if an earthquake occurred. The proceeds would then be used by Oriental Land to repair damages to the park resulting from the earthquake. Investors would pay off the holders of the second bond issue in full, even if an earthquake occurred. However, the maturity of the bond issue would increase from five years to 8.5 years if there were an earthquake. This second bond issue basically provided Oriental Land with emergency funding for 3.5 years should that entity have any difficulty obtaining financing. Thus, not only were investors in the bond market providing earthquake protection, they were also providing future financing protection.

For our second example, consider the use of securities by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) to provide protection against acts of terrorism that might have canceled the 2002 World Cup competition in Asia. Because of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, on the Pentagon in Washington, DC, and in midair over Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, insurance for events canceled as a result of acts of terrorism was becoming difficult to obtain. The insurance company that was supposed to provide cancellation insurance, AXA, decided against providing the insurance because of the attacks on September 11, 2001. Without the cancellation policy, the 2002 World Cup could not take place. To resolve this problem, FIFA, working with the investment banking firm Credit Suisse First Boston, created and then issued in September a bond (referred to as a "cancellation bond") that would be sold in the bond market, thereby transferring terrorism risk to investors in the financial market. The amount of the bonds issued was 260 million.

# Key Points
- In general, insurance companies bear risk from parties who wish to avert risk by transferring it to the insurance companies. The party seeking to transfer the risk pays an insurance premium to the insurance company. Insurance companies pay the insured if and when the insured event occurs.
- The types of insurance include life insurance, health insurance, property and casualty (P&C) insurance, liability insurance, umbrella insurance, disability insurance, and long-term health care insurance.
- An insurance company has three components: guarantor component, investment component, and distribution component.
- The revenue for insurers is derived from the premiums received and from investment returns when premiums are invested until a claim is paid out.
- To reduce risk, a primary insurer can transfer some of its risk to a reinsurance company.
- If an insurance company decides to retain certain risks, it can self-insure against these risks by establishing a captive insurance company that it wholly owns.
- Captive insurance companies are classified as single-parent captives, association captives, industry captives, and diversified captives.
- In the United States, an insurance company is structured either as a stock company (which is similar in structure to any corporation or public company) or as a mutual company (whose owners are the policyholders rather than external investors).
- Because of funding needs for growth, many mutual companies have converted to stock companies, a process referred to as demutualization.
- There are two fundamentally different types of life insurance: term insurance (pure insurance protection) and cash value life insurance (combined insurance protection and investment vehicle).
- Insurance companies increasingly offer products with a significant investment component in addition to their insurance component: guaranteed investment contracts and annuities.
- Insurance products are classified as general account and separate account products.
- The general account of an insurance company refers to the investment portfolio of the overall company, and products usually carry a "general account guarantee" (i.e., are a liability of the insurance company).
- Separate account products receive no guarantee from the insurer's general account, and are guaranteed based on the performance of an account that is separate from the general account of the insurance company, often an account selected by the policyholder.
- Insurance regulation deals with solvency regulation and consumer protection.
- The two principal reasons for the failure of an insurance company are poor liquidity management and underpricing and underreserving.
- In the United States, insurance companies are regulated at the state level, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiency in regulatory oversight.
- The arguments for making the federal government the lead insurance regulator are to eliminate any regulatory inconsistencies across states and to allow better coordination with other federal agencies, such as the Federal Reserve and the SEC.
- In the European Union, the Solvency II Directive has shifted focus from compliance monitoring and capital to evaluating the risk profiles and the quality of their risk management and governance systems.
- There has been considerable debate as to whether large insurers can cause systemic risk events that adversely impact a country's financial market and the global financial market.
- Valid arguments have been made that unlike large banks that are categorized as global SIFIs, the core products of insurers are sufficiently different from those of banks so that they should not be classified as global SIFIs.
- Several studies conclude that insurers do not pose systemic risk to national or global financial markets, although the insurers' noncore activities that may cause systemic risk.
- Insurers of extreme or catastrophic risks night face solvency-threatening events.
- Insurers have entered into other areas of finance: banking and pension funds.
- For P&C insurers, catastrophic risk encompasses the potential damages associated with natural disasters (for example, hurricanes, windstorms, and earthquakes). For life insurers, the catastrophic risks are extreme mortality risk and longevity risk, depending on the life insurance product.
- In addition to reinsuring, insurers have created insurance-linked securities to transfer risk through securitization from insurers to the investing public. These bonds include catastrophe bonds and catastrophe mortality bonds.
- Insurance-based investment banking involves the creation of bonds that can be used in lieu of traditional insurance by those seeking insurance.

9. New York Life, the largest mutual life insurance company in the United States (as well as one of the 100 largest U.S. corporations), explains on its website why it has not converted to a stock company:

The question really comes down to this: What's in the best interests of our policyholders and the company—remaining a mutual or becoming a stock company? The answer for us is absolutely clear: Being a mutual allows us to maintain our focus on serving our policyholders by delivering high performing whole life insurance policies through the best-trained financial professionals in the industry. Over the years we've made innovations in our products and investments in our people to ensure that we'll continue to meet the long-term needs and requirements of our policyholders. We believe this approach is in the best interests of both our clients and our company—today and for the years ahead.[21] a. What is the difference between a stock and a mutual insurance company?

17. In an article in Forbes, the following statement appeared, contrasting the management of stock insurance companies and mutual insurance companies:

With their survival on the line, publicly traded insurers are scrambling for cash by cutting dividends and issuing new shares (diluting existing investors), begging regulators for a relaxation of capital requirements and lobbying Washington for a cut of the 700 billion Wall Street bailout. Their mutually owned rivals haven't asked for a dime. Their statutory surpluses (the regulatory counterpart to book value) have held steady or even increased. Some are announcing plans to pay out near-record dividends to policyholders.[22]

What message is being conveyed in this statement, and how does it relate to the principal-agent problem?

18. What type of strategies have insurers employed to deal with catastrophic risk?
19. For what type of investment product are life insurers concerned with longevity risk?
20. The following statement is from an article by Christopher Kampa and Paul Siegert:

Insurance-linked securities, once considered to be an alternative form of risk transfer, have become a mainstream method of transferring risk from insurers to the capital markets. With greater attention being paid to risk at the institutional level and the search for portfolio diversification at the investment level, insurance-linked securities seem poised to further facilitate the convergence between the capital and insurance markets.[23]

Why do such products as insurance-linked securities represent the convergence of capital markets and insurance markets?

2. Most whole life insurance policies pay death benefits when one specified insured dies. An added dimension of whole life policies insures two people (usually a married couple) jointly and pays the death benefit not when the first person dies but when the second person (usually the surviving spouse) dies. This type of policy is called "survivorship insurance" or "second-to-die insurance." The survivorship feature can be added to standard cash value whole life, universal life, and variable universal life policies. Thus, each of the four policies in table 8.2 could also be written on a survivorship basis. Survivorship insurance is typically sold for estate planning purposes.
