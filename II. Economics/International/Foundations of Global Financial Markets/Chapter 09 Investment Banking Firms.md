Investment banking firms play a key role in capital markets by performing two general functions. For corporations, U.S. government agencies, state and local governments, and foreign entities (sovereigns and corporations) that need funds, investment banking firms assist in obtaining those funds. For investors who wish to invest funds, investment banking firms act as brokers or dealers in the buying and selling of securities. Thus, investment banking firms perform a critical role in the primary market and the secondary market that we describe in chapters 17 and 18.

Investment banking firms are highly leveraged companies, that is, the amount of borrowed funds relative to the amount of equity is high. The activities in which they are engaged dictate that this be the case. Historically, the increasing need for capital resulted in the consolidation of firms in the industry and a change in many firms from a partnership structure to a corporate structure, which gives firms easier access to public funds. Investment banking firms generate revenue from commissions, fee income, spread income, and principal activities. Specifically, these activities can be classified as follows: public offering of securities,

- private placement of securities, securitization of assets,
- mergers and acquisitions, merchant banking,
advising on financial restructuring, trading of securities,
- prime brokerage,
- trading and creation of derivative instruments, and
- asset management.

In this chapter, we describe each of these activities performed by investment banking firms, but before doing so, we describe the way investment banks are classified.

# Investment Banking Industry

In the United States, prior to 1999, federal legislation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act separated the activities of commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies. The Glass-Steagall Act restricted the types of securities that commercial banks in the United States could underwrite—an important investment banking activity, as explained in this chapter. This act had regulated the industry since the Great Depression. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 supplanted the Glass-Steagall Act and eliminated the restrictions on the activities conducted by companies in each financial sector. Now commercial banks as well as insurance companies can underwrite securities.

As a result, the firms that are involved in the activities of investment banking fall into two categories. The first category comprises investment banks that are affiliated with large financial services holding companies. Most such firms are affiliated with large commercial bank holding companies, which the Federal Reserve, the regulator of bank holding companies, refers to as "nonbanking investments." Examples of commercial bank holding companies that have an investment banking affiliate are Bank of America, Barclays Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and UBS. These investment banks are referred to as bank-affiliated investment banks. In the second category are investment banking firms that are independent of a large financial services holding company and for that reason are referred to as independent investment banks. Examples are the Blackstone Group, Greenhill & Company, Houlihan Lokey, Raymond James, and Morgan Keegan.

Investment banking firms are also classified according to the investment banking activities they perform into full-service investment banks and boutique investment banks. Full-service investment banks are basically involved in the wide range of activities described in this chapter. The bank-affiliated investment banks fall into this category. The larger full-service investment banking firms—which are viewed as the premier investment banking firms because of their size, reputation, presence in key markets, and customer base—are referred to as "bulge-bracket" firms. Boutique investment banks specialize in limited areas of investment banking.

Since the financial crisis of 2008, the market share of U.S. investment banks has been dominated by U.S. firms, and the market share of European investment banks has declined.[2] According to several commentaries, small, medium, and large European countries would find European-based global investment banking firms difficult to support and, should there be financial difficulties faced by such firms, it would cause major problems for any European country.[3] The expectation is that in the near future, it is likely that European-based global investment banks' role will continue to decline. Since 2015, the market share of Chinese investment banks in the Asia-Pacific region has surpassed the market share of both U.S. and European investment banks.

Goodhart and Schoenmaker believe that with the declining role of a European-based global investment banks, the result will be a four-tier investment banking system with the first tier being the U.S.-based bulge-bracket firms.4 Strong regional investment banks throughout the world will be in the second tier. In Europe, these firms would include Barclays Bank and NM Rothschild in the United Kingdom and Deutsche Bank in Germany. In the Asia-Pacific region, they would include CITIC in China. The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank (HSBC), the largest bank in Hong Kong, has roots in both the European and Asia-Pacific regions. The third tier, according to Goodhart and Schoenmaker, consists of bank-affiliated investment banking firms that support corporations and governments but are not involved in global investment banking activities. Examples would be Australian and Canadian banks. Finally, boutique firms that specialize in advisory and wealth management activities described later in this chapter represent the fourth tier.

# Public Offering of Securities

The traditional role associated with investment banking is the underwriting of securities. In the United States, the traditional process for issuing new securities involves investment bankers performing one or more of the following three functions: advising the issuer on the terms and the timing of the offering,

buying the securities from the issuer, and

- distributing the issue to the public.

The adviser role may require investment bankers to design a security structure that is more palatable to investors than a particular traditional instrument. Seeking to reduce the cost of borrowing for their clients, investment bankers have designed innovative security structures with characteristics that are more attractive to investors while not being onerous to issuers. We will give several examples of these financial innovations in later chapters.

When selling new securities, investment bankers need not undertake the second function of buying the securities from the issuer. An investment banker can merely act as an adviser or distributor of the new security. The function of buying the securities from the issuer is called **underwriting**. When an investment banking firm buys the securities from the issuer and accepts the risk of selling the securities to investors at a lower price, the firm is referred to as an **underwriter**. When the investment banking firm agrees to buy the securities from the issuer at a set price, the **underwriting** arrangement is referred to as a **firm commitment**. The risk that the investment banking firm accepts in a firm-commitment **underwriting** arrangement is that the price it pays to purchase the securities from the issuer may be less than the price it receives when it reoffers the securities to the public. In contrast, in a best-efforts underwriting arrangement, the investment banking firm agrees only to use its expertise to sell the securities; it does not buy the entire issue from the issuer.

The fee earned from underwriting a security is the difference between the price paid to the issuer and the price at which the investment bank then offers the security to the public. This difference is referred to as the gross spread, or the underwriter discount. Numerous factors affect the size of the gross spread. Two important factors are the size of the offering and the type of security. Generally, the larger the offering size is, the smaller the gross spread will be. In general, the gross spread on bonds is less than for common stock.

A new common stock offering is classified as an initial public offering or a secondary common stock offering. An initial public offering (IPO) is a common stock offering issued by companies that have not previously issued common stock to the public. A study Ritter on IPOs from 1999 to 2013 found that, with few exceptions, gross spreads for moderate-sized IPOs were about  $7\%$ , but megadeals had gross spreads of far less than  $7\%$ :5 Facebook, for example, had a  $1.1\%$  gross spread on a \$16 billion IPO in 2012, Twitter had a  $3.25\%$  gross spread on a \$10 billion IPO in 2013, General Motors had a gross spread of  $0.75\%$  on a \$15.8 billion IPO in 2010, and Visa had a gross spread of  $2.8\%$  on a \$17.9 billion IPO in 2008.

A secondary common stock offering is an offering of common stock that had been issued in the past by the corporation. The range for the gross spread as a percentage of the amount raised is  $3\%$  to  $6\%$ . Because of the risk associated with pricing and then selling an IPO to investors, the gross spread is higher than for a secondary common stock offering. For traditional bond offerings, the gross spread as a percentage of the principal is around 50 basis points. This smaller gross spread compared to that for common stock offerings reflects the lower risk associated with such underwritings.

The typical underwritten transaction involves so much risk of capital loss that for a single investment banking firm to undertake it alone would expose it to the danger of losing a significant portion of its capital. To share this risk, an investment banking firm puts together a group of firms to underwrite the issue. This group of firms is known as an **underwriting syndicate**. The gross spread is then divided among the lead underwriter(s) and the other firms in the **underwriting syndicate**. The lead underwriter manages the deal ("runs the books" for the deal). In many cases, more than one firm may act as lead underwriter, in which case the lead underwriters are said to "co-lead" or "co-manage" the deal. In a bond transaction, the lead underwriters customarily receive  $20\%$  of the gross spread as compensation for managing the deal.

To realize the gross spread, the entire securities issue must be sold to the public at the planned reoffering price, which usually requires a great deal of marketing muscle. Investment banking firms attempt to sell the securities to their investor client base (retail and institutional). To increase the potential investor base, the lead underwriter puts together a selling group. This group includes the underwriting syndicate plus other firms not in the syndicate. Members of the selling group can buy the security at a concession price (a price less than the reoffering price). The gross spread is thereby divided among the lead underwriter, members of the underwriting syndicate, and members of the selling group.

The underwriting of securities is not limited to offerings in the United States. An issuer can select among many foreign securities markets to identify the one in which to offer securities and so reduce its cost of funds. Indeed, some securities are offered simultaneously in several markets throughout the world.

Investment bankers also may assist in offering the securities of government-owned companies to private investors. This process is referred to as privatization. An example is the IPO of the U.S. government-owned railroad company Conrail in March 1987. More than 58 million shares were sold, raising a total of  \$1.65 billion. It was the largest IPO in the history of the United States. Other examples from outside the United States are the United Kingdom's British Telecom, Chile's Pacifica, and France's Paribas. In the case of British Telecom (the government-owned telephone company of the United Kingdom), the amount raised was\$ 4.7 billion. This global offering was offered simultaneously in several countries. In the 1990s, investment bankers increased their role in placing the securities of government-owned companies into the hands of private investors. Eastern Europe, for example, followed a major program of privatization.

In the industry, investment banking firms that underwrite securities in the different areas are ranked by some measure of market share, referred to as the "league tables." Investment bankers view this rating as a key indicator of their importance in a market sector. Market share can be measured by the number of deals done in a year or by the total dollar volume of all deals done in a year.[6]

# Private Placement of Securities

In addition to underwriting securities for distribution to the public, investment banking firms place securities with a limited number of institutional investors, such as insurance companies, investment companies, and pension funds.

Investment banking firms assist in the private placement of securities in several ways. They work with the issuer and potential investors on the design and pricing of the security. Investment bankers first design many of the new security structures in the private placement market. Field testing of the innovative securities described in this book most often occurs in the private placement market. For example, zero-coupon corporate bonds were first publicly issued by corporations in April 1981, and the first issue was by J. C. Penney. Prior to that time, a private offering was made by PepsiCo.

An investment banker may be involved with lining up investors as well as designing the issue. Or, if the issuer has already identified the investors, the investment banker may serve only in an advisory capacity. Work as an adviser generates fee income, as does arranging the placement with investors. An investment banker may also participate in the transaction through a best-efforts underwriting arrangement.

The fees for arranging a private placement vary, depending on the issuance amount and the complexity of the transaction. Moreover, when raising venture capital for clients, investment bankers are frequently offered the opportunity to share in the prosperity of the company. This opportunity typically comes in the form of an option to buy a specified number of shares at a price set at the time the funds are raised. An arrangement that allows the investment banking firm to benefit from the company's success is referred to as an "equity kicker."

# Securitization of Assets

The "securitization of assets" refers to the issuance of securities using a pool of assets as collateral. The securitization of home mortgage loans to create mortgage-backed securities was the first example of this process. After 1985, investment bankers worked with corporations to either securitize a wide range of loans and receivables or to buy loans and receivables in the market and issue securities backed by them.

Securities backed by a pool of loans or receivables are called asset-backed securities and are discussed in chapter 27. When an investment banker works with a corporation to issue an asset-backed security, the sale of the security generates revenue from the bid-ask spread. When an investment banker buys loans and receivables and then issues securities, a profit is generated on an asset-backed security transaction, derived as follows: the price that the security is sold for minus the price that the investment banker paid to purchase the collateral (i.e., the cost of buying the loans and receivables) minus the interest cost of "warehousing" the collateral purchased until the securities are sold.

# Mergers and Acquisitions

Investment banking firms are active in mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Also included under M&A activities are leveraged buyouts (LBOs), restructuring and recapitalization of companies, and reorganization of bankrupt and troubled companies.

Investment bankers participate in M&A activity in one of several ways: (1) by finding M&A candidates; (2) by advising acquiring companies or target companies with respect to price and nonprice terms of an exchange, or by helping target companies fend off an unfriendly takeover attempt; and (3) by assisting acquiring companies in obtaining the necessary funds to finance a purchase.

The fees charged by investment bankers in M&A work depend on the extent of their participation and the complexity of the activities they are asked to perform. An investment banker may simply receive an advisory fee or retainer. More likely, an investment banker will receive a fee based on a percentage of the selling price. The fee structure in this case may be one of three types: (1) the percentage may decline with increasing selling price; (2) the percentage may be the same regardless of the selling price; or (3) the percentage may be fixed, with addition of an incentive fee if the price is better than a specified amount. An example of the first fee structure is what is called the 5-4-3-2-1 "Lehman formula." In this fee structure, which some firms have adopted, the fee is set at  $5\%$  of the first  $\$ 1$  million,  $4\%$  of the second  $\$ 1$  million,  $3\%$  of the third  $\$ 1$  million,  $2\%$  of the fourth  $\$ 1$  million, and  $1\%$  for any excess amount. A typical flat percentage is  $2\%$  to  $3\%$  of the selling price.

Participating in an LBO can generate several fees. LBOs call for a firm to be acquired using mostly debt funds and taken private. The debt raised is from one of two sources: senior bank debt and unsecured junior debt (called subordinated debt, or mezzanine financing). An investment banking firm can earn fees from (1) proposing the acquisition, (2) arranging the financing, (3) arranging bridge financing (i.e., temporary funds lent until permanent debt financing is completed), and (4) other advisory fees.

An investment banking firm may provide its own capital for bridge financing. This type of merchant banking is discussed in the next section.

Under "other advisory fees" are the fees charged by investment banking firms for providing a valuation of a firm that is the subject of a takeover or a merger, and for rendering a "fairness opinion." The question of fairness arises in such a transaction based on the issue of whether the purchasers of the company might have had access to information that allowed them to acquire the firm at a price less than its true market value. This situation is of increasing concern in LBOs, particularly management-led LBOs (that is, where the current management of the firm makes an offer to purchase the company). An investment banking firm is typically engaged by the board of directors of the company that is the subject of the takeover to render an independent and expert opinion as to the fairness of the price being offered for the shares. The need for a fairness opinion, as well as advising, has increased as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The board of directors will want to have a third party review some of its major business transactions before it approves them. Fees for a fairness opinion range from  \$50,000 for a transaction involving a few million dollars to\$ 1 million or more for large transactions.

# Merchant Banking

When an investment banking firm commits its own funds by taking either an equity interest or a creditor position in companies, this activity is referred to as merchant banking. Investment banking firms have divisions or groups that undertake merchant banking through a series of private equity funds. As described by one boutique investment banking firm, Noble Capital Markets, merchant banking activities include:

- Targeting domestic companies within our areas of focus and expertise
- Analyzing a company's opportunities and assessing its risks within their respective industry
Structuring, negotiating and executing the transaction
- Work in assessing the appropriate time and manner in which to harvest the investment.

The work of the merchant banking team does not stop after the transaction. As noted by Noble Capital Markets, the firm assists the "management team and Board of Directors to create value and grow their businesses to facilitate long-term shareholder value."

# Advising on Financial Restructuring

Financial restructuring involves a significant modification of a corporation's capital structure, operating structure, or corporate strategy with the objective of improving efficiency. Financial restructuring may be undertaken to (1) avoid bankruptcy or problems with creditors or (2) reorganize the firm under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Investment bankers advise corporations on financial restructuring in order to generate fee income.

Here are two examples of financial restructuring situations advised by the boutique investment banking firm Greenhill & Co. as reported on the firm's website. In 2011, the firm advised a natural gas-fired power plant located in Texas, Bosque Power Company, on its negotiations with lenders and restructuring. In the same year, the firm advised a U.K. listed multichannel retailer, Findel plc, on the "restructuring of its balance sheet comprising an equity capital raising and refinancing of its debt and pension obligations."9

# Trading of Securities

A successful underwriting of a security requires a strong sales force. The sales force provides feedback on advance interest in the deal, and the traders (or market makers) provide input into pricing the deal as well. It would be a mistake to think that once all the securities are sold, the investment banking firm's ties with the deal are ended. In the case of bonds, those who bought the securities will look to the investment banking firm to make a market in the issue. Therefore, the investment banking firm must be willing to take a principal position in secondary market transactions. Revenue from this activity is generated through (1) the difference between the price at which the investment banking firm sells the security and the price paid for the securities (called the "bid-ask spread") and (2) appreciation of the price of the securities held in inventory. Obviously, if the securities depreciate in price, revenue will also be reduced.

To protect against a loss, investment banks engage in hedging strategies. The various strategies employed by traders to generate revenue from positions in one or more securities include riskless arbitrage, risk arbitrage, and speculation. Below we discuss the first two strategies.

# Riskless Arbitrage

In the finance industry, the term "arbitrage" is used to refer to two types of transactions: riskless arbitrage and risk arbitrage. The first type of arbitrage transactions, riskless arbitrage, calls for a trader to find a security or package of securities trading at different prices. For example, some common stocks of companies trade in more than one location in the United States. Also, the common stock of some multinational companies trades in both the United States and on an exchange in one or more foreign countries. If price discrepancies occur in the various markets, it may be possible to lock in a profit after transaction costs by selling the security in a market where it is priced higher and buying it in a market where it is priced lower. In the case of a security priced in a foreign currency, the price must be converted based on the exchange rate.

Traders do not expect such situations to occur, because they are rare. Although they do occur periodically in financial markets, riskless arbitrage opportunities of the type described are short lived. In some situations, however, packages of securities and derivative contracts, combined with borrowing, can produce a payoff identical to that of another security, even though the two are priced differently. The key point is that a riskless arbitrage transaction does not expose the investor to any adverse movement in the market price of the securities in the transaction.

Because the concept of riskless arbitrage provides the underlying process by which assets are priced, we will provide an example. The following table shows three securities, A, B, and C, that can be purchased today; one year from today, we assume they can experience only two possible outcomes, state 1 and state 2:

<table><tr><td>Security</td><td>Price ($)</td><td>Payoff in State 1 ($)</td><td>Payoff in State 2 ($)</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>35</td><td>25</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>30</td><td>15</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Z</td><td>40</td><td>19</td><td>66</td></tr></table>

In this example, we use the following notation. Let  $W_{\mathrm{A}}$  and  $W_{\mathrm{B}}$  be the quantity of security A and B, respectively, in the portfolio. Then the payoff (i.e., the terminal value of the portfolio) under the two states can be expressed mathematically as follows:

Payoff if state 1 occurs:  $\50W_{\mathrm{A}} + \$ 30W_{\mathrm{B}} ;

Payoff if state 2 occurs:  $100W_A +$ 120W_B.

Can we create a portfolio consisting of A and B that will reproduce the payoff of C regardless of the state that occurs one year from now? That is, we want to select  $W_{\mathrm{A}}$  and  $W_{\mathrm{B}}$  such that:

If state 1 occurs: $50W_A + $30W_B = 38;

If state 2 occurs:  $\ {100}{W}_{\mathrm{A}} + \$  {120}{W}_{\mathrm{B}} = \$ {112}  .

The dollar payoff on the right-hand side of the two equations is the payoff of C in each state.

We can solve these two equations algebraically, obtaining a value of 0.4 for  $W_{\mathrm{A}}$  and 0.6 for  $W_{\mathrm{B}}$ . Thus, a portfolio consisting of 0.4 of security A and 0.6 of security B will have the same payoff as security C. How much will it cost us to construct this portfolio? As the prices of A and B are \$70 and \$60, respectively, the cost is

$$
0. 4 0 (\$ 7 0) + 0. 6 0 (\$ 6 0) = \$ 6 4.
$$

Note that the price of C is \$80. Thus, for only \$64, an investor can obtain the same payoff as C. This riskless arbitrage opportunity can be exploited by buying A and B in the proportions given above and shorting (selling) C. (Short selling is discussed in chapter 23.) This action allows the investor to lock in a profit of \$16 today regardless of what happens one year from now. By selling C, the investor must pay \$38 if state 1 occurs and 112 if state 2 occurs. The investor will obtain the amounts necessary to make the payments in either state that occurs from the payoff resulting from A or B.

# Risk Arbitrage

Certain trading strategies are believed to carry a low level of risk. Because of the risk exposure, such trading strategies are unfortunately labeled risk arbitrage. Of the two types of risk arbitrage, the first arises in the case of exchange offers for securities of corporations coming out of a bankruptcy proceeding. For example, suppose that company A is being reorganized, and one of its bonds is now selling in the market for  \$200. If the trader believes that the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings will be the exchange of three securities with an estimated value of\$ 280 for the existing bond worth \$200, then the trader will buy the existing bond. The trader will realize a profit of \$80 if in fact the final exchange offer is as anticipated, and the value of the package is worth 280.

The spread between the  \$280 potential package and the\$ 200 price for the bond reflects two risks: the risk that the exchange will not take place on the terms that the trader believes, and the risk that the value of the package of three securities that will be received will be less than 200. The "risk" in this risk arbitrage transaction reflects these two risks.

The other type of risk arbitrage occurs when a merger or acquisition is announced, referred to as merger arbitrage. The merger or acquisition can involve a cash exchange, an exchange of securities, or a combination of both. We'll first consider a cash exchange. Suppose that company X announces that it plans to make an offer to buy company Y's common stock for \$100 per share at a time when company Y's common stock is selling for \$70. One would expect that the market price of Y's common stock would rise to about \$100. The risk, however, is that company X will, for whatever reason, withdraw its planned purchase of the stock. The price of company Y's common stock consequently may rise to, say, \$90 rather than \$100. The \$10 difference is the market's assessment of the likelihood of the planned purchase not being completed. An investor who buys the common stock of Y can lock in a profit of \$10 if the purchase occurs at \$100. The risk is that it will not occur and that the price will decline below 90.

The various attempts of UAL Corporation (the parent company of United Airlines) provide a classic example of the risk associated with this type of risk arbitrage. In September 1989, a group consisting of pilots and management made a  \$300 per share bid for UAL's stock. Even though the board of UAL approved the offer, the bidders could not obtain the necessary financing to complete the transaction. During this time, the stock reached a peak of\$ 296 per share. In mid-October, when the bidding group acknowledged that the transaction would not take place, the stock fell by almost 50\% in a matter of a few days. In January 1990, another bid for UAL Corporation for \$201 per share was made by the union. Once again, the financing for the takeover could not be obtained, resulting in a plunge in the market price. Industry experts estimated these failed takeover attempts resulted in losses to risk arbitrageurs of more than \$1 billion.

When a transaction involves the exchange of securities rather than cash, the announced terms of the exchange will not be reflected immediately in the price of the securities involved. For example, suppose that company B announces that it plans to acquire company T. Company B is called the "bidding" or "acquiring" firm, and company T is the target firm. Company

B announces that it intends to offer one share of its stock in exchange for one share of company T stock. At the time of the announcement, suppose that the prices of the stock of B and T are \$50 and \$42, respectively. If the acquisition does take place as announced, a trader who acquires one share of company T for \$42 can exchange it for stock worth \$50, a spread of 8. This spread reflects three risks: (1) the acquisition may not be consummated for one reason or another, and then T's stock may have to be sold, possibly at a loss; (2) the time delay means a cost is involved in financing the position in T's stock; and (3) the price of company B's stock can decline in value so that when T's stock is exchanged for B's, less of a spread is realized.

The way to protect against this last risk is for the trader to buy shares of T and sell short an equal number of shares of B (recall that the transaction is a one-for-one share exchange) so as to lock in a spread of 8 if the transaction is consummated. Let's look at what happens now if the price of company B's stock changes at the time the transaction is consummated. At that time, the price of the stock of company B and company T will be the same.

Suppose the price of company B's stock falls from $50 to $45. Then, when the trader exchanges one share of stock T for stock B, there will be a profit of \$3 at the purchase price of \$42 for stock T. The short sale of one share of stock B for \$50 can now be covered by buying it back for \$45, realizing a profit of \$5. The trader's overall profit will be \$8, the spread that the trader wanted to lock in.

Suppose instead that at the time the exchange is consummated, one share of stock B is worth \$60 per share. By exchanging stock T, which was purchased at \$42, for one share of stock B, which is now worth \$60, a trader can realize a profit of \$18 on this leg of the transaction. However, because stock B was sold short for \$50 and must now be purchased for \$60 to cover the short position, a loss of \$10 is realized on the second leg of the transaction. Overall, a profit of \$8 is still realized. Thus, risk arbitrage to lock in a spread, if the exchange is consummated on the announced terms, involves buying the shares of the target company and shorting the shares of the acquiring or bidding company. The number of shares depends on the exchange terms. Our example assumes a one-for-one exchange, so one share of company B was shorted for every share of company T purchased. Had the exchange been one share of company B for every two shares of company T, then one share of company B would have been shorted for every two shares of company T purchased.

The first risk remains: the risk that the deal will not be consummated. To reduce this risk, the trader or research department must carefully examine the likelihood of a successful takeover or merger.

# Proprietary Trading

Proprietary trading, or "prop" trading, occurs when the trader positions the capital of the investment banking firm to take advantage of a specific anticipated movement of prices or a spread between two prices. The benefits of being right, particularly with a highly leveraged position, are rewarding. We read in the popular press that some investment banking firms have reaped millions of dollars from some specific speculative position; it should be remembered, however, that just as often we read about large trading losses from speculative strategies.

Here are just a few notable examples of major financial debacles from prop trading:

- In April and May 2012, JPMorgan Chase lost approximately 6 billion from trades on complex derivatives in its London office.[10]
- The now bankrupt Lehman Brothers lost \$32 billion in 2008 from prop trading and other transactions when the bank acted as a principal. The company's common equity at the time was only \$18 billion.
- Merrill Lynch and Citigroup lost  \$20 and\$ 15 billion, respectively, in structured products known as collateralized debt obligations (see chapter 39).
- In the fourth quarter of 2007, Morgan Stanley lost 4 billion in prop trading.
- In February 1995, a derivatives trader for Barings Bank, Nick Leeson, speculated in Nikkei 225 stock index futures and Japanese government bonds, resulting in losses so great that it brought down the bank. Although the trades were unauthorized, it highlights that proprietary trading must be accompanied by risk control systems.

Economists, regulators, and market participants have argued that prop trading at bank-affiliated investment banks was a leading cause of the global financial crisis that began in 2007. Because of the financial debacle arising from prop trading by bank-affiliated investment banks, the Obama Administration proposed, as part of regulatory reform, prohibiting financial institutions that benefit from government support (such as the insuring of deposits by the federal government) from engaging in certain activities that would place the bank's capital at risk. One such activity is prop trading. This prohibition or limitation of prop trading by banks is popularly referred to as the Volcker Rule, so named after the adviser to President Obama and former Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker, who proposed it.

Subsequent to the proposal in 2011 of the Volcker Rule, debates followed as to its merits. One of the major concerns with implementing the Volcker Rule is drawing the line between prop trading and market making. That is, it may be difficult to define prop trading in some instances because of the similarity of that activity to the normal market-making activity of bank-affiliated investment banks. In his letter to the Fed, Volcker also warned regulators to be careful when defining market making. He said that holding "substantial securities in a trading book for an extended period obviously assumes the character of a proprietary position, particularly if not specifically hedged,"[11] and that is what the Volcker Rule tries to prevent.

Banks opposed any such restrictions, because historically, a significant share of their profits was generated from prop trading, as well as from other activities involving principal transactions. However, among the major supporters of the Volcker Rule were some who had formerly held key positions in the financial industry. For example, in a comment letter to the SEC, John Reed, the CEO of Citigroup from 1984 to 2000, described the rule as a "critical response" to prop trading, and went even further to state that the penalties for its violations were not severe enough. He noted, "When a firm is focused on market gain, it will employ every available device to achieve those gains—including taking advantage of clients and putting the firm at risk." It is interesting to note in that in the 1990s, Mr.

Reed was a key driver in passing legislation for the separation of commercial and investment banking (the Glass-Steagall Act).

In a *Wall Street Journal* editorial, Roger Vasey, who managed the global debt markets group at Merrill Lynch, disputed the claims of opponents of the Volcker Rule that it would impair the ability of the banks to generate profits.[12] He argued that based on his experience, banks could be successful without proprietary trading, noting that this was the case before Merrill Lynch became a bank-affiliated investment bank. After the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, banks that did have government-guaranteed deposits took on riskier positions.

In addition to officials of investment banking firms who attacked the Volcker Rule, others expressed concern regarding the rule's impact on market-making activities. A January 16, 2012, comment letter to the SEC by Darrell Duffie of Stanford University focused on the adverse impact on market making that would be an unintended consequence of the Volcker Rule:

[The] proposed implementation of the Volcker Rule would reduce the quality and capacity of market-making services that banks provide to U.S. investors. Investors and issuers of securities would find it more costly to borrow, raise capital, invest, hedge risks, and obtain liquidity for their existing positions. Eventually, non-bank providers of market-making services would fill some or all of the lost market-making capacity, but with an unpredictable and potentially adverse impact on the safety and soundness of the financial system.

The letter goes on to identify and then explain the two major unintended consequences of the proposed Volcker Rule:

1. Over the years during which the financial industry adjusts to the Volcker Rule, investors would experience higher market execution costs and delays. Prices would be more volatile in the face of supply and demand shocks. This loss of market liquidity would also entail a loss of price discovery and higher costs of financing for homeowners, municipalities, and businesses.
2. The financial industry would eventually adjust through a significant migration of market making to the outside of the regulated bank sector. This would have unpredictable and potentially important adverse consequences for financial stability.

Other important players in the financial market expressed concern about the Volcker Rule's impact on market making in non-U.S. government bonds. The Volcker Rule did exempt U.S. government bonds, but not the bonds of other countries. In an interview on Bloomberg Television on January 30, 2012, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of Canada (the central bank of Canada), expressed concern about how the failure to clearly distinguish between prop trading and market making could have an adverse impact on the market for foreign government bonds. Governor Carney, an important financial policymaker, pointed out that because the Volcker Rule did not exempt the government bonds of other countries, a market in which U.S.-based banks played a key role, "there is a potential for real liquidity change."[13] The same concern was expressed in a Bloomberg interview on January 25, 2012, with respect to Canada's federal and provincial government bonds, by Ontario's finance minister Dwight Duncan. Objections were also raised by the Japanese central bank that the cost of trading its country bonds would increase as a result of the Volcker Rule. The internal commissioner of the European Union, Mark Barrier, also expressed similar concern to the U.S. Treasury.

After two years of debate and fine-tuning of the Volcker Rule, initially proposed in November 2011, the final rule was approved in December 2013 with an effective implementation date of April 2014. In general, the Volcker Rule as adopted prohibits a banking entity from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading and (2) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund. A banking entity is defined as an insured depository institution and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions. The Volcker Rule does expressly permit certain trading activity, such as underwriting activities, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging activities, trading in government obligations, undertaking insurance company activities, and organizing and offering hedge funds or private equity funds. However, larger banks and bank affiliates (size being based on the amount of total assets) that conduct proprietary trading of the sort permitted by the Volcker Rule are subject to compliance reporting to ensure they are conforming to the rule.

As a result of the Volcker Rule, 1 bank-affiliated investment banks have closed down their prop trading desks, and some have spun off their prop trading desks as independent ventures (specifically, hedge funds, which are described in chapter 32). For example, Credit Suisse spun off its internal hedge fund (an entity that did prop trading) to create the entity Credit Value Partners. UBS created an Australian-based hedge fund, MST Capital, which does proprietary trading.

# Execution of Trades for Clients

Commissions are generated by executing trades for investors, both retail and institutional investors. Two common institutional trades that investment bankers are called on to execute are block trades and program (or basket) trades. These trades are discussed in chapter 23.

# Prime Brokerage

An investment banking firm can provide a package of services to hedge fund and large institutional investors. This package of services, referred to as prime brokerage, includes securities finance (i.e., securities lending and the financing of securities), global custody, operational support, and risk management systems. Prime brokerage is a fee-driven service, except in the case of securities finance, where interest income is earned.

With respect to securities lending, in the secondary market for securities and the various trading strategies employed by institutional investors, market participants may have to borrow funds to purchase securities or to borrow securities. Because some investors need to borrow securities, other investors who own securities may be willing to lend them. Institutional investors usually look to an investment banking firm that is operating in the secondary market to provide these services. Investment banking firms generate fee income and interest income for their participation in these activities.

# Trading and Creation of Derivative Instruments

Futures, options, swaps, caps, and floors are examples of instruments that can be used to control the risk of an investor's portfolio, or, in the case of an issuer, the risk associated with the issuance of a security. These instruments are referred to as derivative instruments and allow an investment banking firm to realize revenue in several ways. First, customers generate commissions from the exchange-traded instruments they buy and sell. This process is no different from the commissions generated by the brokerage service performed for customers when stocks are bought and sold.

Second, certain derivative instruments are created by an investment banking firm for its clients when it acts as a counterparty to the agreement. These products are called over-the-counter instruments or dealer-created derivative instruments. An example is a swap, which we describe in chapter 37. The risk of loss of capital is present when an investment banking firm is a counterparty, because the investment banker becomes a principal to the transaction. To protect against capital loss, an investment banking firm will seek another party to take the other side of the transaction. When this occurs, spread income is generated.

Derivative instruments are also used to protect an investment bank's own position in transactions. Here are just two examples. Suppose an investment banking firm underwrites a bond issue. The risk that the firm is exposed to is a decline in the price of the bonds purchased from the issuer, which are to be reoffered to the public. Using either interest rate futures or options (the subject of chapters 34 and 37), the investment banking firm can protect itself. As a second example, an investment banking firm has many trading desks with either long or short positions in a security. Derivative instruments can be used by the trading desks to protect the firm against an adverse price movement.

# Asset Management

Full-service investment banks have divisions that manage assets for various clients, such as insurance companies, endowments, foundations, corporate and public pension funds, and high-net-worth individuals. These asset management divisions may also manage regulated investment companies. Examples include Goldman Sachs Asset Management (a division of Goldman Sachs & Co.) and Morgan Stanley Investment Management (a division of Morgan Stanley). Money management activities generate fee income based on a percentage of the assets under management.

# Key Points
- Investment banking firms distribute newly issued securities and are involved in the secondary market as market makers and brokers.
- Before 1990, the Glass-Steagall Act separated the activities of commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies, thereby restricting the types of securities that commercial banks in the United States could underwrite, an important investment banking activity.
- The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 supplanted the Glass-Steagall Act and eliminated the restrictions on the activities conducted by companies in each financial sector, so that commercial banks as well as insurance companies can underwrite securities.
- Firms involved in the activities of investment banking fall into two categories: bank-affiliated investment banks and independent investment banks.
- Investment banking firms are highly leveraged companies.
- The services performed by investment banking firms include the public offering (underwriting) of securities, trading of securities, private placement of securities, securitization of assets, mergers and acquisitions, merchant banking, advising on financial restructuring, securities finance, prime brokerage, trading and creation of derivative instruments, and asset management.
- Full-service investment banking firms engage in many activities associated with investment banking; boutique investment banking firms specialize in one or a few of these activities.
- In the United States, the traditional process for issuing new securities involves (1) advising the issuer on the terms and the timing of the offering, (2) buying the securities from the issuer, and (3) distributing the issue to the public.
- Underwriting is the function of buying the securities from the issuer, with the investment banking firm accepting the risk of selling the securities to investors at a lower price.
- In a firm-commitment underwriting arrangement, the investment banking firm agrees to buy the securities from the issuer.
- In a best-efforts underwriting arrangement, the investment banking firm does not buy the entire issue from the issuer but instead agrees only to use its expertise to sell the securities.
- The gross spread earned by an investment banker is the difference between the price paid to the issuer and the price at which the investment bank then offers the security to the public.
- A new common stock offering is classified as an initial public offering (IPO) or as a secondary common stock offering.
- An IPO is a common stock offering issued by companies that have not previously issued common stock to the public. A secondary common stock offering is an offering of common stock that had been issued in the past by the corporation.
- To share the risk of capital loss that may be incurred by a single investment banking firm's underwriting of an issue, an investment banking firm puts together an underwriting syndicate.
- A selling group is put together for an underwriting to increase the potential investor base.
- Various strategies are employed by traders to generate revenue from positions in one or more securities: riskless arbitrage, risk arbitrage, and speculation.
- A riskless arbitrage trade calls for a trader to find a security or package of securities trading at different prices.
- Certain trading strategies are believed to carry a low level of risk, and because of the risk exposure, such trading strategies are unfortunately labeled risk arbitrage.
- Proprietary trading (prop trading) involves a trader positioning the firm's capital to take advantage of a specific anticipated movement of prices or a spread between two prices.
- The Volcker Rule as adopted prohibits a banking entity from (1) engaging in proprietary trading and (2) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund.
- Exceptions to the Volcker Rule are defined for certain trading activities, such as underwriting activities, market making-related activities, and risk-mitigating hedging activities.
- There is a concern that the Volcker Rule might have an unintended adverse impact on the liquidity of certain types of securities.
- Investment banking firms assist in the private placement of securities as opposed to the public offering of securities.
- Investment banking firms create asset-backed securities or work with clients to create such securities.
- Investment banking firms generate revenue from mergers and acquisitions (M&As), which include leveraged buyouts (LBOs), restructuring and recapitalization of companies, and the reorganization of bankrupt and troubled companies.
- Investment bankers may participate in M&A activity in one of several ways: (1) by finding M&A candidates; (2) by advising acquiring companies or target companies with respect to price and nonprice terms of an exchange, or by helping target companies fend off an unfriendly takeover attempt; and (3) by assisting acquiring companies in obtaining the necessary funds to finance a purchase.
- Merchant banking refers to an investment banking firm committing its own funds by either taking an equity interest or a creditor position in companies.
- Financial restructuring involves a significant modification of a corporation's capital structure, operating structure, or corporate strategy with the objective of improving efficiency.
- Securities lending is an activity whereby an investment banking firm puts together borrowers and lenders of securities.
- Securities lending is part of the more general area known as securities finance.
- Prime brokerage is a fee-driven activity whereby an investment banking firm provides a package of services to hedge fund and large institutional investors. The services may include securities finance (i.e., securities lending and the financing of securities), global custody, operational support, and risk management systems.
- Investment banking firms generate revenue from derivatives markets from (1) commissions on the trading of exchange-traded instruments by clients and (2) income from being counterparties to clients that want to take a position in an over-the-counter or dealer-created derivative instrument.
- Full-service investment banks have divisions that manage assets for various clients, such as insurance companies, endowments, foundations, corporate and public pension funds, and high-net-worth individuals.
