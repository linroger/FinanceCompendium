Read any publication dealing with a topic in finance, and undoubtedly you will see the term "risk" used. Listen to any business program on television or radio, and it is highly likely that you will hear the term "risk" used in different ways. The reason is that the term is a general concept that has different meanings in finance. As we will explain in this chapter, there are different types of risks that arise in different contexts. So unless one qualifies what type of risk one is referring to, what is meant by the term will be unclear. For example, we will see that financial markets have a wide range of market participants with varying tolerances for different types of risk. The risk one market participant is willing to accept is not necessarily the risk acceptable to another participant. The development of well-functioning financial markets involves the creation of risk-reducing instruments to transfer some form of risk from one market participant who wants to reduce or eliminate the exposure to that risk to another who is willing to accept that same risk.

In this chapter, we provide an overview of the different types of financial risk that will be referred to throughout this book and the general principles of managing risk, referred to as "risk management." This chapter covers a wide range of topics, some of which were mentioned earlier in this book and some of which will be taken up in more detail in later chapters.

# Defining Risk

There is no shortage of definitions of risk. The word "risk" is derived from the Italian verb riscare, which means "to dare." In Chinese, risk or venture (fēng xiǎn) is expressed as two symbols, the first meaning danger and the second meaning opportunity. In everyday parlance, risk is often viewed as something that is negative, such as a danger, a hazard, or a loss. But we know that some risks lead to economic gains, whereas others have purely negative consequences. For example, although the purchase of a lottery ticket involves an action that results in the risk of losing an amount equal to the cost of the ticket, it potentially has a substantial monetary reward. In contrast, the risk of death or injury from a random shooting is a purely negative consequence.

Businesses recognize that accepting risk is necessary to obtain the competitive advantage that leads to the generation of profits. Introducing a new product or expanding production facilities involves both return and risk. When a business is exposed to an event that can cause a shortfall to a targeted financial measure or value, this is a financial risk that it faces. The financial measure or value could be some measure of the company's profit, such as earnings per share or return on the amount invested by the company's owners. The financial goals for households are monetary objectives, such as accumulating a target dollar amount from saving and investing to purchase a car or home, financing the costs of a child's college education, or funding retirement at some target age. When seeking to achieve financial goals, households must accept the risk associated with the financial assets in which they invest and the risks associated with the investment strategies that they employ.

# Risk versus Uncertainty

When formulating theories about how assets are valued in the financial market, the assumption made is that when facing risk, investors pursue plausible decision rules to select assets. Theories in corporate finance likewise assume that when facing risk, management will follow rules that are plausible as it makes key financial decisions that have an impact on the firm's value. The rules that are applied in decision making by both investors and managers are based on their beliefs regarding the set of outcomes that can result from a decision. In formulating those beliefs about outcomes, theories in finance assume that investors and managers can draw on probabilities to quantify the risk associated with outcomes.

We often refer to risk as the uncertainty regarding what may happen in the future. But is risk equivalent to uncertainty? Economists have argued this question of "risk as uncertainty" or "risk versus uncertainty." The distinction between risk and uncertainty was first made in 1921 by two economists, Frank Knight and John Maynard Keynes. The distinction that Knight made between risk and uncertainty is as follows. He argued that "risk" applies to decision making in which the outcome of the decision is unknown, but the decision maker can fairly accurately quantify the probability associated with each outcome that may arise from that decision. Knight referred to this risk as "measurable risk" or "risk proper." In contrast, Knight viewed uncertainty as applying to decisions in which the decision maker cannot know all the information needed to determine all probabilities associated with the outcomes. This situation gives rise to what is referred to as Knightian uncertainty and what Knight referred to as "unmeasurable uncertainty" or "true uncertainty."

Knight provides the following example to help distinguish between risk and uncertainty. Consider an urn that includes red and black balls. Two individuals are drawing from the urn. The first individual has no information about the number of red and number of black balls in the urn and assumes there is an equal probability of drawing a ball of either color. In contrast, the second individual has information that the urn contains three red balls for each black ball. This means that the second individual knows that for every four balls in the urn, three are red and, therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball is  $75\%$  and the probability of drawing a black ball is  $25\%$ . According to Knight, the second individual faces risk, whereas the first individual faces uncertainty.

John Maynard Keynes made a similar distinction, arguing that there is risk that can be calculated and another sort of risk he labeled "irreducible uncertainty." Keynes recognized that in some decisions, the risks cannot be calculated, because attempting to do so would require relying on assumptions about the future that have no basis in probability theory.

In practice, is the distinction between risk and uncertainty made by Knight and Keynes of importance in decision making? This is a long-running debate among economists: Some have argued that the two concepts are the same, but others argue that the distinction is crucial. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009, however, provided support for the Knight-Keynes view of the distinction between risk and uncertainty. One of the major factors that contributed to the financial crisis was the failure of risk management models to warn about the financial problems leading to the financial crisis. It appears that the management of financial entities thought they had adequate risk models to prevent a major collapse in the financial system. That is, management of financial entities failed to recognize that they were dealing with situations that involved Knightian uncertainty or Keynes's irreducible uncertainty.

More recently, Nassim Taleb has popularized the term black swan event to characterize a high-impact, hard-to-predict, and rare event that is beyond the realm of normal expectations based on historical events in financial markets, technology, and the sciences. In the context of financial markets, a "high-impact event" means that the event has a large monetary impact. Basically, a black swan event is a surprise to the decision maker and after the event has occurred, the failure to consider such an event is inappropriately rationalized. Linking this to Knightian uncertainty, black swan events are presumed not to exist.

Systematic Risk versus Idiosyncratic Risk

In the study of financial markets, one of the key issues covered in this book is asset pricing. To determine the fair value of an asset and how an asset's value will change over time, the factors that drive (i.e., affect) asset valuation must be determined. Because the factors affect asset valuation, they are referred to as "risk factors." However, for simplicity in our discussion here, we will refer to them as simply "factors."

Because the factors are assumed to affect the valuation of all assets in an asset class, they are referred to as common risk factors or systematic risks. In addition to systematic risks, there are factors that may be unique to the issuer of a particular asset. This risk is referred to as idiosyncratic risk. For example, in later chapter 14 we discuss systematic factors for common stock. Examples of idiosyncratic risk for a company would be a prolonged strike by its employees, an uninsured natural disaster that destroys a principal manufacturing plant, the expropriation of major overseas manufacturing facilities by the government of the country in which the facilities are located, or a patent infringement by the company.

In chapter 14, we review theories about the pricing of assets. These theories tell us that in markets that operate efficiently when pricing assets, investors should only be compensated for accepting systematic risks. In other words, assets price only systematic risks. The reason is that, according to one of the major theories in finance, idiosyncratic risk can be eliminated through the proper selection of assets so as to create a diversified portfolio. In contrast, one cannot eliminate systematic risks by creating a diversified portfolio. Hence, systematic risks are referred to as nondiversifiable risks, and idiosyncratic risk is referred to as diversifiable risk.

# Financial Risk Management

Financial risk management involves the following activities: identifying financial risks,

- quantifying each identified risk, and
- evaluating how to deal with each identified risk.

# Identifying Financial Risks

Not all risks faced by households, financial entities, and businesses are easy to identify. Some risks, unfortunately, are identified only after a financial problem or financial crisis occurs. The three general categories of financial risk that businesses, financial entities, and households face are (1) investment risk, (2) funding risk, and (3) systemic financial risk. We describe each of these risks in later sections of this chapter.

# Quantifying Risks

Not all risks can be quantified. In finance, financial metrics have been used to quantify many of the risks described later in this chapter. These metrics draw on concepts in the fields of probability and statistics. This is the principal reason that it is critical for students interested in the study of finance to have a strong background in probability and statistics.

All models used in finance to measure risk are based on assumptions and estimated parameters. Some market observers argue that it was the failure of risk models used for quantifying risk of financial institutions that resulted in the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. This is why it is critical to understand the underlying assumptions of the risk measures and models discussed throughout this book. The Knight-Keynes distinction between risk and uncertainty should always be kept in mind when using and applying a risk measure when managing financial risk.

Evaluating How to Deal With Each Identified Risk

Once the relevant risks are identified, corporate and household risk management involves evaluating how to deal with each risk. This is the risk retention decision, because it involves determining which risks to retain. The choices for dealing with each risk are:

- retaining the risk, neutralizing the risk, or
- transferring the risk.

Of course, each identified risk can be treated differently. For each of the three choices—retention, neutralization, and transfer—there are in turn further decisions as to how the risk should be handled.

Retained risk The decision as to which identified risks a business or a household should retain is based on an economic analysis of the expected benefits versus expected costs associated with bearing that particular risk. Aggregating all the risks across any risk that a business or household has elected to bear produces what is called its retained risk. Any retained risk realized will have a potential adverse economic impact. In the case of a business, it may adversely impact earnings, cash flow, and the value of the business; for a household, it may have an adverse impact on income and net worth.

With respect to businesses, an unfunded retained risk is a retained risk for which potential losses are not financed until they occur. In contrast, a funded retained risk is one for which an appropriate amount is set aside up front (either as cash or as an identified source for raising funds) to absorb the potential loss. The management of retained risk is referred to as risk finance.

Risk neutralization If a business or household elects not to retain an identified risk, there are two alternatives: neutralize the risk or transfer the risk. Risk neutralization is a risk management policy whereby a business or household acts on its own behalf to mitigate the outcome of an expected loss from an identified risk without transferring that risk to a third party.

A risk neutralization strategy can involve mitigating the probability of the identified risk occurring or reducing the severity of the loss should the identified risk in fact occur. For a business, a risk neutralization strategy for some risks may be a natural outcome of the business itself or of financial factors affecting the business. For example, suppose that a company projects an annual loss of  \$100 million to\$ 150 million from returns because of product defects, and this amount is material relative to the company's profitability. A company could introduce improved manufacturing processes to reduce the probability of defect for each item produced. This would reduce both the variance of the number of defective products and the expected number of defective products. Alternatively, the company could implement an exchange policy to reduce the loss per defective product. Either strategy could reduce the upper range of the potential loss.

As an example involving a financial factor, a Japanese-headquartered company operating in both Japan and in countries in the Eurozone will likely have cash inflows and outflows in euros. As a result, the company faces one of the investment risks discussed later in this chapter, foreign exchange-rate risk: the risk that the exchange rate moves adversely to the company's exposure in that currency. But this risk has offsetting tendencies if there are both cash inflows and outflows in the same currency. Assuming that the currency is the euro, the cash inflows are exposed to a depreciation of the euro relative to the Japanese yen; the cash outflows are exposed to an appreciation of the euro relative to the Japanese yen. If the company projects future cash inflows over a certain period of €80 million and a cash outflow over the same period of €70 million, then the company's net currency exposure is a €10 million cash inflow. That is, €70 million exposure is hedged naturally.

Risk transfer For certain identifiable risks, a company may decide to transfer the risk to a third party. This can be done either by entering into a contract with another party willing to take on the risk or by embedding that risk in some type of security (i.e., creating a market instrument whose payoff depends on the outcome of the risk).

Let's consider households first. The most common risk transfer vehicle used is an insurance policy. For example, home and auto insurance sold by P&C companies are vehicles used by households to obtain both asset protection resulting from some event and protection of a household's wealth that potentially could be put at risk from a lawsuit in which a home or auto was involved. Life insurance policies are available to provide a guaranteed sum of money to the beneficiaries as a result of the loss of income due to the death of the household's principal wage earner; annuities, discussed in chapter 8, can be used to provide an income stream for retirement. There are other types of insurance, such as medical insurance and disability insurance. Basically, insurance policies transfer risks from households to insurance companies.

Businesses also use insurance companies to protect assets and mitigate the damage that can be done by those assets. There are capital market instruments called "financial derivatives" (or simply "derivatives") that provide for the efficient transfer of risk. Although derivatives are too often mischaracterized in the popular press as speculative vehicles that can cause havoc in the financial markets, when properly utilized by market participants, they can reduce the types of risks already mentioned and described later in this chapter.

In addition to derivatives, capital market instruments have been created using structured finance technology to transfer risk that was previously taken on by financial institutions (such as banks and insurance companies) to the investing public. A few examples will illustrate this type of instrument. At one time, depository institutions originated commercial loans to corporations and consumer loans to individuals to purchase a home (residential property); these institutions retained those loans in their portfolios. The risks associated with the loans were borne by the depository institution. Because the loans were held in the portfolio of depository institutions, they tied up much needed capital. It is expected that regulatory capital requirements for depository institutions (i.e., how much capital a depository institution must have) will increase over time due to changing regulations. As a result, it is expected that the world's depository institutions will not have sufficient capital to provide loans to governments, businesses, and consumers throughout the world. One of the solutions that depository institutions have adopted is to sell bonds that are backed by a pool (i.e., package) of loans that they originated. The investors in these bonds then look for their payment not from the depository institution that created the bonds but from borrowers whose loans are in the pool of loans. The bonds created are referred to as "securitized products" or "asset-backed securities," and the process of creating them is referred to as asset securitization.

The asset securitization process, which we describe in much more detail in chapter 27, transfers the risks associated with the pool of loans from the depository institution that created the asset-backed securities to the investors who purchase these securities. However, it has been argued that asset securitization was responsible for the financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007. As a result, asset securitization is viewed, much like derivatives, as an "evil" capital market mechanism that seeks to exploit the general public. We discuss the merits of this view in chapter 27. Here we only note that governments throughout the world have either adopted or proposed legislation that would foster the development of asset securitization.

Although asset securitization is often used by depository institutions, operating companies use this process to remove the risks associated with the loans they grant to customers. For example, automobile manufacturers make loans to customers for the purpose of purchasing an automobile. Automobile manufacturers can retain those loans and bear the risk associated with them. By pooling automobile loans to create asset-backed securities, automobile manufacturers transfer those risks to the investors who buy the securities.

Asset securitization is not the only type of capital market instrument for transferring risk. Asset securitization is a type of structured finance vehicle, which we describe in chapter 27. Here is one example of the type of capital market instruments that insurance companies have created to transfer specific risks.

P&C companies are concerned with catastrophic events that can cause major losses. For example, the heavy rainfalls in France at the beginning of June 2016 resulted in insured losses that were expected to be as much as €600 million (U.S.682 million). It is estimated that more than 1,000 natural catastrophes occurred in 2015, resulting in overall insured losses of 31 billion.5 To transfer the risk of such catastrophes to investors willing to accept this insurance risk by potentially earning a higher interest rate, P&C companies created catastrophe bonds (nicknamed "cat bonds"). The payoff to an investor in a cat bond depends on whether a qualifying catastrophe or event occurs. If it does, the bondholders will lose part or all of the principal they invested, and the P&C company that issued the cat bond can use the funds not paid to bondholders to recoup some or all of the losses from the event.

# Investment Risk

In very general terms, investment risk refers to the likelihood that an investment or an investment strategy will have a performance outcome that is less than what the investor expected. In the general category of investment risk are various types of risk that can result in below-expected performance. These risks include credit risk,

price risk, reinvestment risk,

- inflation risk, liquidity risk, and
- foreign exchange-rate risk.

# Credit Risk

Credit risk is a major risk in the financial system. This type of risk encompasses many forms of risk, and there is no standard definition as to what it means.

Most market participants refer to credit risk in the context of the failure of a borrower in a lending agreement to satisfy the contractual obligation to make timely payments of interest and repayment of principal. Lending agreements include loans and bonds. Used in this way, credit risk refers to default risk. For example, when an individual borrows money from a bank to purchase a home, the lending arrangement exposes the lending bank to default risk—the risk that the borrower will fail to repay the loan. When in April 2013, Apple issued 17 billion of bonds, the purchasers of those bonds were exposed to default risk—the risk that Apple would not be able to make the interest payments or repay the principal when it comes due.

Although the term "credit risk" is most commonly used in the context as just described, credit risk in a broader sense means the failure of a counterparty to a transaction to fulfill its obligation. This form of credit risk, referred to as counterparty risk, exists not only in financial market transactions but also in many transactions in everyday life. Here are two examples of such transactions. When an individual purchases a one-year subscription to a magazine and pays for that subscription fee upfront, there is the risk that the magazine publisher will go out of business and therefore not fulfill its obligation to deliver the magazine. When an individual pays for a service prior to its performance, there is the risk that the service provider will fail to perform. Service providers often request "advances" or "deposits" before undertaking a service.

Many transactions in financial markets involve counterparty risk. We will see this when we discuss private transactions throughout this book. For example, suppose that on May 1, 2014, an investor enters into a transaction with a financial institution in which the two parties agree to the following. For a sum of \$264,000 paid by the investor to the financial institution at the time the agreement is entered into, the financial institution agrees to allow the investor to purchase 10,000 shares of company X for \$200 per share on May 1, 2018. As explained in chapter 34, this transaction is a special type of derivative transaction called an "option." At the time of the transaction, suppose that on May 1, 2014, the price of a share of company X's stock was \$132. Hence, this agreement allows the investor to benefit from a rise in the price of company X's stock above \$200. No matter what happens to company X's stock four years later on May 1, 2018, the investor forgoes the \$264,000 payment. On May 1, 2018, suppose Company X's stock price was \$448 per share. This transaction would generate a profit for the investor as follows. The investor would purchase the company X's stock from the financial institution at the agreed-on price of \$200 per share. This would require the payment for 10,000 shares of \$2,000,000 (= 200 × 10,000). The total cost of acquiring the 10,000 shares would be  \$2,264,000, which is the\$ 2,000,000 needed to purchase the stock plus the \$264,000 to enter the agreement on May 1, 2014. The value of the 10,000 shares on May 1, 2018 would be $4,480,000 (= $448 × 10,000), resulting in a profit of \$2,216,000. However, suppose that when the investor requests that the financial institution perform its part of the agreement, this counterparty does not have the financial ability to do so. This is counterparty risk.

Derivative transactions of the sort described above are very common in financial markets, and there is a major concern about counterparty risk in the financial system. An extreme example of counterparty risk that underscores its critical importance was the bankruptcy of a major financial institution, Lehman Brothers Holding Inc., in September 2008. At the time, this firm was the counterparty in many private transactions involving derivative instruments, and its bankruptcy resulted in the failure to satisfy its obligations in these transactions. Moreover, the firm also borrowed funds so the firm's creditors realized default risk, because Lehman was unable to repay its debt obligations.

Admittedly, default risk and counterparty risk seem very much like the same type of risk, namely, the risk that one party to a transaction will fail to perform, and, in fact, many market participants do use the terms interchangeably. If one wanted a way to distinguish between the two risks, the examples above should serve. The term "default risk" is commonly used to describe a lending arrangement in which the borrower fails to perform. "Counterparty risk" is the term typically used when the failure occurs in a derivative transaction that is not a lending or a funding arrangement. Some market participants refer to counterparty risk as "counterparty default risk."

Credit risk encompasses one more type of risk, which might best be explained with an illustration. Let's consider once again the Apple bonds. At the time that they were issued, the price of those bonds reflected the default risk as perceived by market participants. As discussed in chapter 11, by "price," we mean the interest rate that Apple will have to pay to bondholders when it issues the bonds. The greater the perceived default risk, the higher the interest rate Apple will have to pay. That interest rate is made up of at least two components. The first component is the interest rate that investors want for holding a bond that has no default risk. The second component is compensation for the default risk perceived by investors. That additional compensation for default risk above the interest rate on a default-free bond is referred to as the credit spread. That credit spread is not constant over the life of the bond. The risk that an investor in Apple bonds faces is that sometime in the future, the market will view Apple as having a greater default risk and as a result will require a greater credit spread, which will have an adverse impact on the price of the bond. This aspect of credit risk is referred to as credit spread risk.

Measuring credit risk The measurement of default risk and counterparty risk requires an analysis of the ability of the issuer or counterparty to meet its obligations. Professional asset managers analyze an issuer's financial information and the specifications of the debt instrument itself to estimate the ability of the issuer to live up to its future contractual obligations. This activity is known as credit analysis. Most large institutional investors have their own credit analysis department not only to assess the credit risk of an issuer/counterparty but also to determine limits on how much exposure to that issuer or counterparty is acceptable. Banks maintain credit departments for assessing credit risk. The credit analysts in these departments develop internal ratings that are used when making lending decisions.

Investors who do not have access to their own credit analysis use, to different degrees, opinions about default risk as provided by the credit rating agencies who perform credit analysis and cast their opinion in the form of a credit rating. As explained in chapter 5, the three major rating agencies are S&P, Moody's, and Fitch, although more firms have entered the rating business over the past few years.

Criticism of the performance of credit rating agencies have led to service providers formulating credit scoring models and credit risk models for evaluating credit risk. Let's look first at credit scoring models.

A credit scoring model takes information about the attributes of a borrower and through statistical analysis derives a credit score. Based on the credit score, a lender may decide to grant a loan or to classify lenders into different credit risk classes. For individuals, the best-known credit scoring model is one used to construct the FICO score. The model assigns a percentage weight to such factors as length of credit history and amount owed, all information provided by credit bureaus, to derive the FICO score. The FICO score, which ranges from 300 to 850 (with higher scores indicating a better credit rating), is used to measure credit risk for consumer credit decisions, such as mortgage lending, auto loans, and credit card lines of credit. For corporations and governments, credit risk models have been developed to determine the probability of default and, if a default does occur, how much will be recovered.

Market instruments for controlling credit risk Because of the importance of controlling credit risk, several credit risk transfer vehicles are available in the market. Some of these vehicles are derivatives, referred to as "credit derivatives," with the type most commonly used by investors called "credit default swaps." In addition, securitized products (known as collateralized loan obligations) have been created that are issued by banks, and there are bonds (known as credit-linked notes) issued by corporations that use structured finance. These credit risk transfer vehicles are the subject of chapter 39.

# Price Risk

The price of an asset will change over time. That is, the price can increase or decrease. The concern to an investor who owns an asset is that the price will decrease. For example, suppose an investor purchased the stock of General Electric Company on November 12, 2015, for  \$30.41 per share. The price risk that this investor faces is that the price per share would decline below\$ 30.41. On August 1, 2018, the price for the stock was \$13.63, which would have resulted in a loss of \$16.78 per share.

One might be tempted to say that price risk is the risk of a decline in the price of an asset. However, that is not true because of a position that one can take in an asset. Buying an asset does in fact result in a loss if the price declines. When an investor buys an asset, the investor is said to be "long the asset," or to be in a long position for that asset. However, an alternative position is to be "short the asset," which means that the investor has sold an asset, even though the investor did not own the asset sold. This may sound like a criminal act. However, the ability to sell an asset that is not owned, referred to as "selling short," is a critical aspect of financial markets that allows asset prices to reflect their true values. We'll have more to say about the mechanisms available in the market for short selling and the economic role of short selling in later chapters. What is important here is that for a short position, price risk is the risk that the price will increase. Let's consider once again the stock of General Electric on November 12, 2015, for  \$30.41 per share. Now suppose that instead of buying that stock, the investor sold the stock short for\$ 30.41 per share. On April 19, 2016, the stock price was \$31.14. This means that if the investor had to produce the stock on that day (which is referred to as "covering the short position"), the investor would have had to pay \$31.14 to buy the stock. Because the investor sold the stock for \$30.41, this investor would have realized a loss of \$0.73 per share.

So now we see that price risk is the risk of an adverse movement in the price of a stock, which could result from either an increase or a decrease in an asset's price, depending on the investor's position. A long position's price risk is that the price will decline; a short position's price risk is that the price will increase. In general, we can say that price risk is the risk of an unfavorable movement in an asset's price.

What causes price risk? The starting point for answering this question is to understand what factors cause an asset's price to change. Basically, this means determining what drives an asset's price. So, to determine price risk, we must at least understand qualitatively what variables drive an asset's price. The variables that affect an asset's price are referred to as "risk factors" or simply "factors." In the case of a stock, one might believe that the price of the stock is affected by the earnings of a company, the growth of those earnings, and the level of interest rates. It is reasonable to expect that the factors driving the price of a bond are the level of interest rates in the market and the issuer's credit rating.

Measuring price risk Given the factors that one would expect to drive an asset's price, one must develop a model that links an asset's price sensitivity to the factors. Such models are referred to as "asset pricing models." Given an asset pricing model, one can measure an asset's price risk exposure to each factor. That is, there may not be one measure of price risk for an asset but one for each factor. The exposure of an asset to a factor is referred to as its factor beta. The factor beta is estimated using various statistical models incorporating historical returns for the asset.

In the case of debt obligations, such as bonds, the key drivers of the change in a bond's price are the level of interest rates and the issuer's credit risk. The level of interest rates is measured by the interest rate on what is viewed as a default-free security, securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As mentioned earlier, the component of the interest rate that reflects compensation for the issuer's credit risk is the credit spread

A mathematical relationship between the bond's price and these two factors (i.e., Treasury rates and credit risk) can be developed to estimate the exposure of a bond to each of these factors. In general, the term duration is used to quantify the exposure of a bond's price to changes in Treasury interest rates. We describe this measure in more detail in chapter 16. The exposure of a bond's price to changes in the issuer's credit risk is referred to as credit spread duration, because it refers to the exposure to changes in the credit spread.

Market instruments for controlling price risk There are many derivative instruments in the marketplace for controlling the price risk of an individual asset and a portfolio of assets. We describe derivatives to control price risk for common stock and derivatives to control exposure to interest rate risk in part VIII of the book.

# Reinvestment Risk

Reinvestment risk is the risk that when proceeds are received from an investment, they will have to be invested at an interest rate that is less than when the original investment was made.

Investors in bonds face reinvestment risk. First, when a bond is purchased, one can compute the potential yield for that bond, as explained in chapter 11. The yield calculated assumes that the bond is held to maturity and that any interest payments can be reinvested from the time the interest payment is received from the bond issuer until the bond matures. Here is an example. Suppose that in May 1984, an investor purchased a bond issued by the U.S. Treasury that matured in 30 years (i.e., it would have matured in May 2014). The yield on that bond would have been approximately  $13\%$ .

That is, if one of those bonds had been purchased for  \$1,000, the annual interest rate that would have been paid by the U.S. Department of the Treasury was\$ 130 per year or 65 every six months. An investor would typically say that a 13\% yield was being earned. However, as explained in chapter 11, this is the case only if (1) the interest received every six months can be reinvested at an annual interest rate of 13\%, and (2) the bond is held to maturity (May 2014 in our example). A little knowledge of the history of interest rates since the 1980s will make it clear why it is unlikely that the interest payments received from the U.S. Treasury would not have allowed for reinvestment at 13\%. For example, 10 years after the bond was purchased (i.e., in May 1994), the interest received would had to have been reinvested in 20 years Treasury bonds, which at the time offered 7.5\%, far less than the reinvestment rate needed to generate a 13\% yield. Moving forward another 10 years to May 2004, when the interest received would had to have been reinvested for another 10 years, the 10-year Treasury interest rates were about 3.5\%. Five years later, the interest received would have been reinvested at 2.13\%. Hence, one can see the reinvestment risk faced by an investor who purchased the U.S. Treasury bonds in May 1984. How serious is reinvestment risk? The amount of interest from the reinvestment of the bond's interest to generate the expected 13\% yield is substantial, as is demonstrated in chapter 11. In contrast, if an investor in May 2014 purchased a 30-year Treasury bond, the yield at that time was only 3.4\%, and expectations were that the interest rate would not fall far below that rate. Hence, the reinvestment risk would have been far less.

Another example of reinvestment risk faced by a bond investor arises when the bond has a feature that allows the issuer to repurchase the bond from the investor at some future date. This provision, referred to as a call provision, is a benefit to the issuer, because it allows the issuer to retire the bond issue if interest rates have declined since the time the bond was issued and then issue new bonds at the lower interest rate. This call provision results in reinvestment risk for the investor, who will then have to reinvest the proceeds received from the issuer at a lower interest rate than when the bonds were purchased.

Inflation occurs when the prices of most goods and services rise, resulting in a reduction in purchasing power. When income rises at a rate less than the inflation rate, then the standard of living of households declines. Failing to take into account inflation when planning for retirement can result in a retirement income supporting a lower standard of living than was expected. When an investor invests in assets to generate retirement income, the real return that the investor realizes is the return after adjusting for the inflation rate. Inflation risk, also referred to as purchasing power risk, is the risk that the nominal return earned (i.e., the return without considering inflation) will be less than the inflation rate. Put differently, inflation risk is the risk of earning a negative real return.

When investing in different asset classes, an investor is exposed to different degrees of inflation risk. For example, historically, stocks and real estate have been observed to expose investors to less inflation risk than do bonds. Given that each asset class has a different exposure to inflation risk, a portfolio composed of different asset classes will have an exposure to inflation risk that depends on the allocation to each asset class.

Although the typical bond may have greater inflation risk than common stock and real estate, there are bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, financial institutions, and nonfinancial corporations that have protection against inflation risk. These bonds are referred to as inflation-adjusted bonds (also called "linkers"). For such bonds, the interest rate or the principal is indexed to the inflation rate. In addition, some derivatives allow for the control of inflation risk.

# Liquidity Risk

Liquidity allows investors the flexibility to rebalance a portfolio (i.e., by buying and selling assets) in order to implement an investment strategy. Liquidity can be viewed in terms of the potential loss that an investor may realize if the investor wishes to sell immediately instead of engaging in a costly and time-consuming search to identify a buyer willing to pay a higher price. A financial asset's liquidity may depend on the quantity that the investor wishes to sell (or buy). Although an investor may wish to sell a small quantity of an asset that is liquid, there may be illiquidity if a large quantity of the asset is to be sold.

As explained in chapter 9, although an asset's liquidity serves an important function, there is no uniformly accepted definition of what liquidity is. Several studies have defined liquidity in terms of the ability of an investor to trade an asset at short notice at a low cost and without having a significant adverse impact on the asset's price. Liquidity risk for an asset can then be defined as the risk that when an investor executes a trade for that asset, prevailing market conditions will be such that the cost will be higher and there will be a significant adverse impact on the price at which the trade is executed.

Foreign Exchange-Rate Risk

When an investor acquires an asset whose cash flows are not denominated in the investor's domestic currency, the investor is really taking two positions—a position in the asset and a position in the currency. If the investor has a long position, there is the risk that the currency will change at the time of receipt of the cash flow such that fewer units of the domestic currency are realized. More specifically, the risk is that the currency in which a cash flow is paid (i.e., the foreign currency) will depreciate relative to the domestic currency. This risk is referred to as foreign exchange-rate risk or currency risk. Certain foreign exchange derivative products—the subject of chapter 38—can be used to control the degree of an investor's foreign exchange-rate risk exposure.

There is potentially another risk associated with investing in an asset whose cash flows are denominated in a foreign currency. A foreign government may prevent its currency from being fully converted into a convertible currency. (A convertible currency is one that can be freely exchanged into another currency.) The risk of loss associated with an action taken by a foreign government to make its currency inconvertible is called convertibility risk.

Funding Risk

Funding risk, also referred to as financing risk, is the risk associated with obtaining funds. There are four types of funding risk: leverage risk, funding liquidity risk, timing risk, and fixed-floating financing risk.

# Leverage Risk

When individuals or businesses borrow funds, they are said to be using financial leverage, or simply, "leverage." Benefits and risks are associated with the use of leverage by businesses. To understand them, we take as an example the chief financial officer (CFO) of a corporation who is considering borrowing \$400 million at a cost of 6\% per year. The corporation will deploy the proceeds received in various business activities with the purpose of generating a rate of return that exceeds the cost of borrowing (6\% per year). The corporation benefits in terms of adding to its profitability by the difference between the rate of return earned and the cost of borrowing. For example, if the corporation earns 8\% on the \$400 million borrowed, then the cost of the borrowed funds for the year is \$24 million (6\% × \$400 million), and the amount received from deploying the funds in the business is \$32 million (8\% × \$400 million). The difference of 8 million adds to the corporation's profit. If the CFO borrowed even more funds, the amount of profit added would have been even greater as long as the corporation earned more than 6\% per year.

What we have just described is the benefit of using leverage. The risk should be obvious: it is the risk that the corporation fails to earn a return on the amount borrowed greater than the cost of borrowing. In our illustration, suppose that the corporation earns only 2\% per year on the borrowed funds. It thus paid \$24 million for the borrowed funds but generates only \$8 million, reducing its profitability as a result of the borrowing by 16 million. If the amount of leverage employed is such that the cost of all the borrowed funds by the corporation results in the inability of the firm to pay its contractual debt obligations, creditors will force the firm into bankruptcy.

Leverage risk is the adverse financial impact resulting from the use of leverage. The degree of leverage of a corporation can be measured in two ways: the debt ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio. The debt ratio is the amount of funds provided by the corporation's creditors (referred to simply as "debt") divided by the total amount of funds that the corporation has available to invest (i.e., total assets). The basic financial accounting identity is:

Total assets = Equity + Debt.

Then total assets represent the amount of funds available for the corporation to invest. The debt-to-equity ratio is:

Debt ratio  $= \frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Total assets}}$ .

The higher the debt ratio is, the greater will be the leverage used by the corporation. For firms in the same industry, the higher the debt ratio is, the greater the leverage risk will be.

The second way to calculate the degree of leverage is by computing the debt-to-equity ratio:

Debt-to-equity ratio  $= \frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Equity}}$ .

The higher the debt-to-equity ratio is, the greater the leverage will be, and therefore for firms in the same industry, the greater the leverage risk will be.

The decision regarding the amount of debt relative to equity that a corporation should have (i.e., the degree of leverage) is referred to as its "capital structure decision." There are various financial theories that suggest the factors a corporation should consider when determining its optimal capital structure.

In chapter 6, we described depository institutions, which include banks. These financial institutions are highly leveraged. That is, the percentage of funds they invest represents predominantly borrowed funds relative to the equity raised from stockholders. The debt ratio for depository institutions is roughly  $92\%$  (expressed as a percentage). The profitability of depository institutions depends primarily on management's ability to invest in loans and other debt obligations so as to earn a higher return than its cost of borrowing.

Households also borrow funds and thereby create leverage and face leverage risk. The benefits associated with the use of leverage by households are not as easy to quantify as those for corporations and depository institutions. Households borrow to accelerate the purchase of goods and services rather than to postpone any purchase until sufficient funds are available for an outright purchase without borrowing. Certain purchases do have economic benefits that households believe will accrue by borrowing. Two examples are borrowing for college education and purchasing a home. In the former case, the expectation is that the cost of borrowing for college will generate lifetime future earnings that warrant the cost. In the case of the purchase of a residence using borrowed funds, the belief is that ownership of a home rather than renting will provide a benefit as a result of the potential price appreciation of the home purchased. This was a belief shared by many households prior to the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007.

Funding Liquidity Risk

It is not uncommon for participants in financial markets to be forced to settle financial obligations immediately at the request of the lender. For example, a bank's depositors for some reason may want to withdraw funds from a bank at the same time. The bank must have the ability to satisfy those obligations immediately. Another example is a highly leveraged investor whose borrowing agreement grants the lender the right to request the immediate payment of the amount borrowed. The ability of the borrower to settle its debt obligations immediately is referred to as funding liquidity. Funding liquidity risk is then the risk that over a specific horizon, an entity will not be able to settle its obligations with immediacy.

Timing Risk

Timing risk is the risk associated with the timing of raising capital. More specifically, it is the risk that the cost of obtaining funds will be higher than expected at some future date when the funds are needed.

As an example of timing risk, consider a corporation that wants to raise funds by borrowing in the marketplace. Suppose that in September 2008, a corporation with a credit rating of BBB (the meaning of which we explain in chapter 5) wanted to issue a  \$400 million 20-year bond. The person in a corporation responsible for determining how much to raise and when to raise those funds is the CFO. Suppose that the CFO has determined that the\$ 400 million is not needed immediately. Instead, the CFO was considering either issuing the bonds that day or sometime over the next five months. Let's look at this CFO's decision using actual market interest rates. According to interest rate data published by the Federal Reserve, the interest rate for such a corporation seeking to borrow for 20 years and whose credit rating was BBB would have been about  $7.31\%$  in September 2008. By issuing immediately, the CFO would have locked in a cost of  $7.31\%$  for the next 20 years. Here is what the Federal Reserve reported as interest rates for the next four months: October 2008,  $8.38\%$ ; November 2008,  $9.21\%$ ; December 2008,  $8.49\%$ ; and January 2009,  $8.19\%$ . This was a period of considerable interest rate volatility in the financial markets, as can be seen by the large movement in interest rates over this five-month period. The timing risk faced by the CFO was that by not issuing the bonds that day, the CFO placed the company at risk of having to issue the bonds over the next four months at a higher interest rate than it would have paid in September 2008. Indeed, that is what happened, because the interest rates were higher for each of the four months following September 2008.

Suppose the CFO decided not to issue the bond in September 2008, but seeing that interest rates rose from  $7.31\%$  to  $8.38\%$  in one month and then again in the following month (from  $8.38\%$  to  $9.21\%$ ), the CFO decided to issue the bonds in November 2008 at  $9.21\%$ . The timing risk that the CFO faced when the decision was made to issue the bonds in November 2008 was losing the opportunity to benefit from a decline in interest rates, which did in fact occur in the next two months ( $8.49\%$  and  $8.19\%$  in December 2008 and January 2009, respectively).

State and local governments share the same timing risk as businesses. They raise funds and are concerned with the interest rate that they must pay. Because interest rates fluctuate, the risk is that they may have to raise funds at a time when interest rates are higher than they currently are.

Although our illustration of timing risk involves raising funds in the form of borrowed money (bonds in our example), the CFO faces timing risk when a decision must be made to raise funds by issuing common stock. To understand this, suppose the CFO of a corporation wants to raise  \$200 million by issuing common stock at a time when the common stock is\$ 100 per share. The funds are not needed immediately but sometime over the next 60 days. Ignoring the cost of issuing the common stock, this means that if the CFO issues immediately, then two million shares ( \$200 million/\$ 100) would have to be issued. By postponing the issuance to take advantage of a rise in the price of the corporation's common stock, the CFO takes the risk that the stock's price will decline, forcing the corporation to issue more than two million shares of common stock. By issuing more shares, the corporation will have more shares outstanding, diluting corporate earnings more than if it issued the common stock today.

Households face timing risk, particularly with the purchase of a home. A household that has the capacity to purchase a home now with borrowed funds at prevailing interest rates faces two forms of timing risk. The first is that the interest rate at which it must borrow to purchase a home is known today (called the mortgage rate), but postponement of the purchase may result in having to pay a higher mortgage rate. The second is that if the purchase is postponed to a future date, housing prices may increase, resulting in the household having to borrow more to purchase a home.

Fixed-Floating Financing Risk

Another form of funding risk involves the decision to pay a fixed interest rate over the entire time period for which the funds are borrowed (referred to as fixed-rate borrowing) or to pay an interest rate that varies periodically (variable-rate borrowing or floating-rate borrowing). This form of funding risk is referred to as fixed-floating financing risk.

With floating-rate borrowing, the interest rate is reset (i.e., changes) at designated times and is reset according to a formula. The formula has two components: a reference rate plus a constant amount. The reference rate is some market interest rate that changes over time. For example, the most common reference rate is the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), a rate we discuss further in chapter 25. The constant amount is referred to as the margin. So, as an example, the interest rate formula on a floating-rate debt obligation that resets every year might be one-year LIBOR plus 150 basis points. In the formula, one-year LIBOR is the reference rate and the margin is 150 basis points. Because the one-year LIBOR changes every year, the rate that the borrower would pay varies every year while the debt obligation is outstanding.

Let's consider a CFO of a U.S. corporation deciding whether to issue a 400 million bond that pays a fixed interest rate of 6\% per year for the next 20 years. Alternatively, the CFO can issue a 400 million floating-rate bond whose interest rate resets every year based on the formula: one-year LIBOR plus 150 basis points. Suppose that for the first year, one-year LIBOR is 3\%. Then for the first year, the borrowing cost for the 400 million will be 4.5\% (3\% + 150 basis points). This would be a clear advantage to borrowing on a floating-rate basis. However, the risk is that over the next 19 years, one-year LIBOR might rise above 4.5\%, which would make borrowing on a fixed-rate basis more advantageous. If the CFO selects the fixed-rate borrowing alternative, then the risk is that one-year LIBOR will fall below 4.5\%, so that floating-rate borrowing would be more advantageous.

Fixed-floating financing is faced not only by businesses when determining the form of financing that they will use but also by households when they purchase a home with borrowed funds. When borrowing funds to purchase a home, a household can select a loan that has a fixed rate over its life or a floating rate over its life. A floating-rate loan to purchase a home is referred to as an "adjustable-rate loan" and is described in chapter 29.

# Systemic Financial Risk

In general, the term systemic risk refers to the probability that an entire system will collapse or fail. When applied to finance, systemic risk is referred to as systemic financial risk. The example typically given to illustrate systemic financial risk is a run on a bank (i.e., bank depositors simultaneously withdrawing their funds from a bank). Prior to the protection offered to bank depositors in the United States through federal deposit insurance, the inability of one bank to meet the demands for the withdrawal of deposits caused not only the failure of that bank but also triggered a chain reaction that produced runs on other banks, causing them to fail.

In 2007 the U.S. Congress, following the problems faced in certain sectors of the financial market in that year, held hearings under the title "Systemic Risk: Examining Regulators' Ability to Respond to Threats to the Financial System." Yet despite the concern about systemic financial risk threat to the global financial system, there is no universally accepted definition of what that risk is. In a 2007 speech, then governor of the Federal Reserve Board Frederic Mishkin defined systemic financial risk as follows:

When we speak of systemic risk, we mean the risk of a sudden, usually unexpected, disruption of information flows in financial markets that prevents them from channeling funds to those who have the most productive profit opportunities.

He then went on to say:

We have seen how systemic risk, when it becomes especially severe, can result in financial crises—the seizing up of financial markets—which can have potentially important economic consequences.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) provides the following definition of systemic financial risk:

The risk that the failure of a participant to meet its contractual obligations may in turn cause other participants to default with a chain reaction leading to broader financial difficulties.

Although there is no universally accepted definition of systemic financial risk, the basic notion is clear. The interconnectedness of financial institutions throughout the world can, by contagion, cause major disruptions to the global financial system. In chapter 2, we gave examples of this concern when we discussed government intervention in the financial market.

# Financial Innovation

Since the 1960s, there has been a surge in the number of significant financial innovations. Observers of financial markets categorize these innovations in different ways. Below we describe just two possible ways of classifying these financial innovations. With an understanding of the risks described in this chapter, the reasons for financial innovation should be clear.

The Economic Council of Canada classifies financial innovations in the following three broad categories:

- Market-broadening instruments, which increase the liquidity of markets and the availability of funds by attracting new investors and offering new opportunities for borrowers.
- Risk management instruments, which reallocate financial risks to those who are less averse to them or who have offsetting exposure, and who are presumably better able to shoulder them.
- Arbitrating instruments and processes, which enable investors and borrowers to take advantage of differences in costs and returns between markets, and which reflect differences in the perception of risks, as well as in information, taxation, and regulations.

Another classification system of financial innovations based on more specific functions has been suggested by the BIS: price risk-transferring innovations, credit risk-transferring instruments, liquidity-generating innovations, credit-generating instruments, and equity-generating instruments.[10] Price risk-transferring innovations provide market participants with more efficient means for dealing with price or exchange-rate risk. Reallocating the risk of default is the function of credit risk-transferring instruments. Liquidity-generating innovations do three things: (1) they increase the liquidity of the market; (2) they allow borrowers to draw on new sources of funds; and (3) they allow market participants to circumvent capital constraints imposed by regulations. Instruments to increase the amount of debt funds available to borrowers and to increase the capital base of financial and nonfinancial institutions are the functions of credit-generating innovations and equity-generating innovations, respectively.

As you read the chapters on the various sectors of the financial markets that we review in this book, it is important to understand the factors behind any innovations in that market.

# Key Points
- Many forms of risk are faced by participants in the financial markets.
- There is a difference between risk and uncertainty, as was first pointed out in 1921 by two economists, Frank Knight and John Maynard Keynes.
- Knight argued that risk applies in situations where the decision maker can fairly accurately quantify the probability associated with each outcome that may arise from that decision; he referred to this risk as "measurable risk" or "risk proper."
- Knightian uncertainty exists when the decision maker cannot know all the information needed to determine all the probabilities associated with the outcomes of a decision. This form of uncertainty was referred to by Knight as "unmeasurable uncertainty" or "true uncertainty."
- Keynes made a similar distinction between risk and uncertainty, referring to the latter as "irreducible uncertainty."
- The risks that affect the value of an asset can be classified as systematic risks and idiosyncratic risks.
- Systematic risks or common risk factors are those risks that affect the valuation of all assets in an asset class. Because they cannot be diversified away, they are also referred to as "nondiversifiable risks."
- Idiosyncratic risk is a risk that is unique to an issuer. Because it can be diversified away in a portfolio, it is referred to as "diversifiable risk."
- The financial risks faced by businesses, financial entities, and households are (1) investment risk, (2) funding risk, and (3) systemic financial risk.
- Broadly speaking, investment risk refers to the probability that the outcome realized by an investment or an investment strategy will be below what the investor expected.
- Financial risk management involves (1) identifying financial risks, (2) quantifying each identified risk, and (3) evaluating how to deal with each identified risk.
- Once the relevant risks are identified, risk management involves assessing which risks to retain, with the choices being (1) retaining a risk, (2) neutralizing a risk, or (3) transferring a risk.
- Retained risk is the aggregate of all risks that a business or household has elected to bear.
- An unfunded retained risk is a retained risk for which potential losses are not financed until they occur; a funded retained risk is a retained risk for which an appropriate amount has been set aside up front (either as cash or as an identified source for raising funds) to absorb the potential loss.
- There are two alternatives for dealing with risks that are not retained: neutralize the risk or transfer the risk.
- Risk neutralization is a risk management policy whereby a business or household acts on its own behalf to mitigate the outcome of an expected loss from an identified risk without transferring that risk to a third party.
- An entity may decide to transfer the risk to a third party by either entering into a contract with another party willing to take on the risk that an entity wishes to transfer or by taking a position in a market instrument whose payoff depends on the outcome of the risk that the entity wishes to transfer to the public.
- Capital market instruments have been created using structured finance technology to transfer risk that was previously taken by financial institutions, with asset securitization being one example.
- Investment risk includes price risk, credit risk, reinvestment risk, inflation risk, liquidity risk, and foreign exchange-rate risk.
- Credit risk encompasses default risk and credit spread risk.
- Several credit risk transfer vehicles are available in the market.
- Price risk is the risk of an adverse movement in the price of an asset that could result from an increase or decrease in an asset's price, depending on the investor's position: A long position's price risk is that the price will decline, and a short position's price risk is that the price will increase.
- Risk factors (or simply, "factors") are the variables that affect an asset's price. A model that shows how these factors affect an asset's price is called an "asset pricing model."
- Given an asset pricing model, one can measure an asset's price risk exposure to each factor, which is referred to as an asset's "beta factor."
- Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity to changes in the general level of interest rates. Credit spread duration is a measure of a bond's price exposure to changes in the credit spread.
- Many derivative instruments are available for controlling the price risk of an individual asset and a portfolio of assets.
- Reinvestment risk is the risk that when proceeds are received from an investment, they will have to be reinvested at an interest rate that is less than when the original investment was made.
- Inflation risk (also referred to as "purchasing power risk") is the risk that the nominal return earned will be less than the inflation rate; that is, inflation risk is the risk of earning a negative real return.
- An asset's liquidity risk is the risk that when an investor executes a trade for that asset, prevailing market conditions will be such that the cost will be higher and there will be a significant adverse impact on the price at which the trade is executed.
- Foreign exchange risk (also referred to as "currency risk") is the risk that the currency in which a cash flow is paid (i.e., the foreign currency) will depreciate relative to the domestic currency.
- Funding risk, or financing risk, is the risk associated with obtaining funds and includes leverage risk, funding liquidity risk, timing risk, and fixed-floating financing risk.
- Leverage risk is the adverse financial impact resulting from the use of leverage.
- The degree of leverage of a corporation can be measured by its debt ratio (the ratio of the debt to total assets) or its debt-to-equity ratio.
- Funding liquidity is the ability of a borrower to settle its debt obligations immediately. The risk that an entity cannot do so is called "funding liquidity risk."
- Timing risk is the risk associated with the timing of raising capital resulting in a funding cost higher than expected at some future date when the funds are needed.
- A funding risk associated with the decision as to whether to borrow on a fixed-rate or floating-rate basis is referred to as a "fixed-floating financing risk."
- In general, the term "systemic risk" refers to the probability that an entire system will collapse or fail. When applied to finance, it is referred to as "systemic financial risk."
- Financial innovations can be classified in terms of the type of financial instrument (market-broadening instruments, risk management instruments, and arbitrating instruments and processes) and according to more specific functions (price risk-transferring innovations, credit risk-transferring instruments, liquidity-generating innovations, credit-generating instruments, and equity-generating instruments).

# Questions

1. In an article, Pablo A. Guerron-Quintana explains the difference between risk and uncertainty as follows:

Consider the experiment of flipping a fair coin (Case A). In this experiment, the unknown is whether the coin will land heads or tails. Because we are dealing with a fair coin, we know that the odds of heads after each flip are 50-50. That is, if we were to flip the coin let's say 100 times, the coin would land, on average, 50 times heads and 50 times tails. The crucial insight from this experiment is the observation that we know exactly the odds of each of the possible events: 50 percent heads and 50 percent tails. Furthermore, we have this knowledge before starting the experiment….

Now let's consider an alternative experiment (Case B). As before, we are interested in learning the result of flipping a coin. The key difference is that we know the coin is no longer fair, but we do not know the odds of obtaining heads. Furthermore, the coin is replaced by a new (and unfair) coin after each flip. Under this scenario, the only thing we know is that the coin will land either heads or tails. If we were thinking about flipping the coin 100 times, we could not (before we start the experiment) tell how many times the coin will land on heads.[11] a. Which of the two experiments is an example of Knightian uncertainty? Explain why.

b. Which of the two experiments is an example of Knightian risk? Explain why.

2. The following quote is from Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2006:

Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know.

Discuss this quote in the context of risk and uncertainty.

3. The quote below is taken from a description of risks by and methods for dealing with risks faced by a financial entity, Goldman Sachs. The three blanks are intentional. In addition to liquidity risk, the quote below discusses another form of risk. What is that risk?

The Goldman Sachs ________ plan sets out the plan of action we would use to fund business activity in crisis situations and periods of market stress. The ________ plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The ________ plan also describes in detail the firm's potential responses if our assessments indicate that the firm has entered a liquidity crisis, which include funding our potential cash and collateral needs as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity.

4. Explain the risk management policy followed by an individual who purchases a home insurance policy that has a large deductible (i.e., an amount of loss that the homeowner absorbs before the insurance company makes a payment).
5. The following is from the University of British Columbia Board of Governors' Policy No. 125 regarding major capital projects:

The University manages risk on major capital projects through a variety of strategies incorporated into its project planning, delivery and procurement processes. Risk management strategies include the avoidance, reduction and transference of risk away from the University, as appropriate. However, some types of risk cannot be fully or economically managed through these means and in those cases, it is prudent and cost efficient to retain and self-insure against such risks.

The document then goes on to describe the establishment of funds for major capital projects to protect against overruns "to manage risk in a prudent and cost-efficient manner, including through the avoidance, reduction or transference of risk away from the University, as appropriate" and to explain how each fund is to be financed. Discuss the general elements of this risk management policy.

6. The following excerpt is taken from various filings of Kimberly-Clark Corporation (manufacturer of well-known products, such as Huggies, Kleenex, and Pull-Ups):

Selected insurable risks are retained, primarily those related to property damage, workers' compensation, and product, automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management's judgment of cost effective risk retention.

Describe this corporation's risk management policy.

7. Suppose that your car needs a major repair that will cost \$3,000. You sign an agreement with the car repair shop to perform the services. The repair shop must order the necessary parts and estimates that it will take one week for the parts to be acquired. The repair shop requires that you provide an upfront payment of \$1,500 as a deposit before the parts are ordered. What is the financial risk to which you are exposed?
8. "Because idiosyncratic risk cannot be diversified away, it is referred to as systematic risk." Explain whether you agree or disagree with this statement.
9. In a speech in 2009, Ben Bernanke, then chair of the Federal Reserve, concluded:

In the wake of the ongoing financial crisis, governments have moved quickly to establish a wide range of programs to support financial market functioning and foster credit flows to businesses and households. However, these necessary short-term steps must be accompanied by new policies to limit the incidence and impact of systemic risk.[12] a. What is meant by systemic risk?

b. Why does systemic risk impede the flow of credit available to businesses and households?

c. Why is government intervention needed to reduce systemic risk rather than relying solely on individual market participants to do so without intervention?

10. The following excerpt is from a paper by Neil Adrian S. Cabiles of the University of Bologna:

Bank engagement in securitization [re]lies on two rationales. One is that securitization provides the bank with an additional funding source and the other is that it can be a risk management tool.[13] a. What is securitization?

b. Why is asset securitization a risk management tool?

11. The following excerpt is from an article by Georges Dionne:

The creation of structured finance was mainly motivated by the transfer of credit risk, through the use of credit derivatives (e.g., CDSs) and banks' securitization of loans, to investors. For example, the selling of bank loans to trusts serves to transfer banks' credit risk via structured products to various groups of investors such as pension funds, industrial and service corporations, hedge funds or even other banks.[14] a. What is meant by "structured finance"?

b. Give two examples of applications of structured finance to risk management other than securitization.

12. What is the relationship between systematic risk and common risk factors?
13. Why is the duration of a bond a common risk factor?
14. a. What is credit spread risk?

b. Why might one expect that credit spread duration would be a quantitative measure of credit spread risk?

15. Mr. Bennett wants to invest 100,000 for the next 10 years with the following investment strategy. The amount will be invested in a defaultfree U.S. government security that matures every month. Every time the security matures, the investor will use the proceeds to invest in another government security with one month to maturity. Suppose further that one-month government securities today pay an interest rate of  $5\%$ . In Mr. Bennett's view, this investment strategy has little risk, because one-month securities have no price risk if held to maturity and he can lock in at least a  $5\%$  return over the next 10 years. Discuss this investment strategy and the risks associated with it.
16. Ms. Callan, a citizen of the United States who resides in the country, wants to invest in a U.K. government bond that matures in 10 years. The government bond in which she will invest pays interest once a year in British pounds, and the principal repayment is also in British pounds. The government bond she is considering pays  $4\%$ , and she believes that interest rates over the next 20 years in the United Kingdom will not fall below  $4\%$ . In the opinion of Ms. Callan, she will be able to earn at a minimum a  $4\%$  return on her investment. What is your opinion regarding the risks of realizing at least a  $4\%$  return?
17. In the early 1980s, when interest rates were at historic highs, investment banking firms introduced a security backed by U.S. government bonds that paid no annual interest (referred to as zero-coupon bonds) with all of the interest being paid at the bonds' maturity date. The securities were given such names as TIGRS (Treasury Income Growth Receipts, a Merrill Lynch product), CATS (Certificates of Accrual on Treasuries, a Salomon Brothers product), and LIONS (Lehman Investment Opportunity Notes, a Lehman Brothers product).

a. Why do you think securities with this feature were introduced at that time?

b. Too often it was stated that these securities had no risk. What risks does an investor face when purchasing these securities?

18. The following excerpt is from an article by Lucy Meakin and David Goodman:

Germany is planning to auction its longest-maturity inflation-linked bonds to date, a sign that the slowest pace of consumer-price increases in the euro region for more than four years isn't deterring investors.[15] a. What is an inflation-linked bond?

b. Why do you think that investors are not deterred from buying these bonds despite low rates of inflation in recent years?

c. What is meant by a "credit rating"?

d. What commercial entities provide credit ratings?

e. What is an internal credit rating?

19. What is the purpose of a credit scoring model?
20. What financial market instruments can be used to control credit risk?
21. a. What is meant by a "call provision" in a bond?

b. Why does a call provision in a bond increase reinvestment risk?

22. In 2006 and 2007, because of concerns about the South Korean currency (the won) appreciating, export companies in that country entered into a derivatives contract called a "knock-in, knock-out contract." Basically, this was an agreement to hedge against an appreciation of the won. Why would South Korean exporters want to hedge against the won appreciating?
23. The following excerpt is from a 2010 article by Shah Gilani:

In today's multinational corporations, managing foreign-currency exposure has evolved into one of the key responsibilities of the chief financial officer (CFO). Former Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) CFO John Conners recently lamented that foreign-currency management is one of the most-difficult and least-understood jobs in finance. If CFOs struggle with currency exposure, we're all in trouble.[16]

What can the CFO do to deal with foreign exchange risk?

24. The CFO of a corporation faces timing risk when raising funds, via the issuance of either bonds or common stock. Explain why.
25. Two corporate treasurers are arguing about the cheapest form of long-term debt financing: fixed-rate or floating rate. They ask for your opinion. Provide it.
26. The CFO of a U.S. corporation is considering borrowing £500 million at a cost of  $4\%$  per year. The corporation will deploy the proceeds received to expand its lines of business.

a. Explain what will happen to corporate earnings if the proceeds invested from the funds raised can earn  $7 \%$ per year.

b. Explain what will happen to corporate earnings if the proceeds invested from the funds raised can earn  $1\%$  per year.

c. Based on your answers to (a) and (b), describe the advantages and disadvantages of the use of financial leverage.

27. a. Banks are highly leveraged entities. Suppose that the debt ratio of a bank is  $92\%$  (expressed as percentage). What does this mean?

b. If a bank has a debt ratio of  $92\%$ , what is the debt-to-equity ratio?

28. A security has been created by pooling loans to individuals who will use the proceeds to purchase a home. The securities that are backed by the pool of loans are called "mortgage-backed securities." If the borrowers in the pool of loans have an impaired credit history (i.e., a poor credit history), then the mortgage-backed securities created are called "subprime mortgage-backed securities." Typically, each loan is for 30 years. One of the major risks faced by an investor in this security is credit risk. This risk is that the borrower will default on the loan, resulting in the loss by investors of principal and interest. To assess this risk, investors would have to forecast how many borrowers would default each year over the next 30 years, as well as how much will be recovered if the borrower defaults. The default and recoveries over the next 30 years depend on a myriad of factors. Two obvious ones are the state of the economy and conditions in the housing market. So forecasting what would be received by an investor over the next 30 years in order to value subprime mortgage-backed securities would require forecasting the state of the economy and the conditions in the housing market. Adding to this problem, the history of defaults of borrowers classified as subprime is limited, because these are relatively new types of loans. Despite the complexities of making the required forecasts and the limited information about default, the risks associated with subprime mortgage-backed securities were calculated by market participants and relied on when assessing the risks of institutional portfolios that contained them and of the trading desks of banks that held them in inventory.

Why does this type of risk modeling fall into the category of Knight's unmeasurable uncertainty and Keynes's irreducible uncertainty?

4. Although in later chapters we discuss "capital" for financial institutions (such as banks and insurance companies), the term is sometimes confused with the term "physical capital," which is used in the production of goods and services by a manufacturing firm (e.g., for machinery, equipment, facilities). Simply put, when referring to the "capital" of a financial institution, the term means the difference between the institution's assets and liabilities. Sounds simple to figure out, except that (as discussed in chapter 7) regulators of financial institutions have different ways in which they measure capital for regulatory purposes.
