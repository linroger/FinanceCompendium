Financial assets have certain properties that determine or influence their attractiveness to different classes of investors and issuers. This chapter introduces these properties in preparation for a more detailed exposition in later chapters. The chapter also provides the basic principles of the valuation or pricing of financial assets and illustrates how several of the properties of financial assets affect their value.

## Properties of Financial Assets

The 11 properties of financial assets are (1) moneyness, (2) divisibility and denomination, (3) reversibility, (4) cash flow, (5) term to maturity, (6) convertibility, (7) currency, (8) liquidity, (9) return predictability, (10) complexity, and (11) tax status.

Some financial assets are used as a medium of exchange or in settlement of transactions. These assets are called money. In the United States, money consists of currency and all forms of deposits that permit check writing. Other assets, although not money, are very close to money in that they can be transformed into money at little cost, delay, or risk. They are referred to as near money. In the case of the United States, these include time and savings deposits and a security issued by the U.S. government called a "Treasury bill."[2] Moneyness is clearly a desirable property for investors.

Divisibility and Denomination

Divisibility relates to the minimum size in which a financial asset can be liquidated and exchanged for money. The smaller the size, the more the financial asset is divisible. A financial asset (such as a deposit) is typically infinitely divisible (down to the penny), but other financial assets have varying degrees of divisibility depending on their denomination, which is the dollar value of the amount that each unit of the asset will pay at maturity. Thus, many bonds come in  \$1,000 denominations, commercial paper in\$ 25,000 units,[3] and certain types of certificates of deposit in 100,000 or more. In general, divisibility is desirable for investors but not for borrowers.

Reversibility

Reversibility refers to the cost of investing in a financial asset and then getting out of it and back into cash again. Consequently, reversibility is also referred to as turnaround cost or round-trip cost.

A financial asset (such as a deposit at a bank) is obviously highly reversible, because usually there is no charge for adding to or withdrawing from it. Other transactions costs may be unavoidable, but these are small. For financial assets traded in organized markets or with market makers (discussed in chapter 18), the most relevant component of round-trip cost is the so-called bid-ask spread, to which might be added commissions and the time and cost, if any, of delivering the asset. The spread charged by a market maker varies sharply from one financial asset to another, reflecting primarily the amount of risk the market maker is assuming by "making" a market.

This market-making risk, which is discussed in more detail in chapter 18, can be related to two main forces. One is the variability of the price as measured, say, by some measure of dispersion of the relative price over time. The greater the variability is, the greater the probability of the market maker incurring a loss in excess of a stated bound between the time of buying and that of reselling the financial asset. The variability of prices differs widely across financial assets. For example, Treasury bills have a very stable price for the reason explained at the end of this chapter, but a speculative stock will exhibit much larger short-run variations.

The second determining factor of the bid-ask spread charged by a market maker is what is commonly referred to as the thickness of the market: essentially, the prevailing rate at which buying and selling orders reach the market maker (that is, the frequency of transactions). A thin market is one that has few trades on a regular or continuing basis. Clearly, the greater the frequency of order flows, the shorter the time that the security will have to be held in the market maker's inventory, and hence the smaller the probability of an unfavorable price movement while held.

Thickness, too, varies from market to market. A three-month U.S. Treasury bill is easily the thickest market in the world. In contrast, trading in stock of small companies is not thick but thin. Because Treasury bills dominate other instruments both in price stability and thickness, their bid-ask spread tends to be the smallest in the market. A low turnaround cost is clearly a desirable property of a financial asset, and as a result, thickness itself is a valuable property. This explains the potential advantage of larger over smaller markets (economies of scale), along with a market's tendency to standardize the instruments offered to the public.

### Cash Flow

The return that an investor will realize by holding a financial asset depends on all the cash distributions that the financial asset will pay its owners; this includes dividends on shares and coupon payments on bonds. The return also considers the repayment of principal for a debt security and the expected sale price of a stock. When computing the expected return, noncash payments—such as stock dividends and options to purchase additional stock, or the distribution of other securities—must also be accounted for.

In a world of nonnegligible inflation, it is also important to distinguish between nominal expected return and real expected return. The expected return that we described above is the nominal expected return. That is, it considers the dollars that are expected to be received but does not adjust those dollars to take into consideration changes in their purchasing power. The net real expected return is the nominal expected return after adjustment for the loss of purchasing power of the financial asset as a result of anticipated inflation. For example, if the nominal expected return for a one-year investment of  \$1,000 is 6\%$ , then at the end of one year, the investor expects to realize 1,060, consisting of interest of \$60 and the repayment of the \$1,000 investment. However, if the inflation rate over the same period of time is  $4\%$ , then the purchasing power of \$1,060 is only $1,019.23 ($1,060 divided by 1.04). Thus, the return in terms of purchasing power, or the real return, is  $1.923\%$ . In general, the expected real return can be approximated by subtracting the expected inflation rate from the expected nominal return. In our example, it is approximately  $2\%$  (6\% minus  $4\%$ ).

### Term to Maturity

Term to maturity is the length of the period until the date at which the instrument is scheduled to make its final payment or the owner is entitled to demand liquidation. Instruments for which the creditor can ask for repayment at any time, such as checking accounts and many savings accounts, are called "demand instruments." Maturity is an important characteristic of financial assets (such as bonds) and can range from one day to more than a half of a century. Bonds with no maturity date, called "perpetual bonds," have been issued to lock-in law interest rates. In the United Kingdom, there is one well-known type of bond issued by the Bank of England called a "consul." Many other instruments, including equities, have no maturity and are thus a form of perpetual instrument.

Note that even a financial asset with a stated maturity might terminate before its stated maturity. This may occur for several reasons, including bankruptcy or reorganization, or because of call provisions entitling the debtor to repay in advance, usually at some penalty and only after a number of years from the time of issuance. Typically, perpetual bonds have a call provision, allowing the issuer to call the bond five years after issuance. Sometimes the investor may have the privilege of asking for early repayment. This feature is called a put option. Some assets have maturities that may be increased or extended at the discretion of the issuer or the investor. For example, the French government issues a six-year obligation renouvelable du Trésor, which allows the investor, after the end of the third year, to switch into a new six-year debt. Similar bonds are issued by the British government. All these features regarding maturity are discussed in later chapters.

Convertibility

As the preceding discussion shows, an important property of some assets is that they are convertible into other assets. In some cases, the conversion takes place within one class of assets, as when a bond is converted into another bond. In other situations, the conversion spans classes. For example, a corporate convertible bond is a bond that the bondholder can change into equity shares. Preferred stock may be convertible into common stock. It is important to note that the timing, costs, and conditions for conversion are clearly spelled out in the legal descriptions of the convertible security at the time it is issued.

Currency

We have noted throughout our discussion that the global financial system has become increasingly integrated. In light of the freely floating and often volatile exchange rates among the major currencies,[4] this fact gives added importance to the currency in which the financial asset will make cash flow payments. Most financial assets are denominated in one currency, such as U.S. dollars or yen or euros, and investors must choose among them with volatile exchange rates in mind.

Some issuers, responding to investors' wishes to reduce currency risk, have issued dual-currency securities. For example, some Eurobonds pay interest in one currency but principal or redemption value in a second. U.S. dollars and yen are commonly paired in these cases. Furthermore, some Eurobonds carry a currency option that allows the investor to specify that payments of either interest or principal be made in either one of two major currencies.

Liquidity

Liquidity is an important and widely used notion, although at present no universally accepted definition of liquidity exists. A useful way to think of liquidity and illiquidity, proposed by Professor James Tobin,[6] is in terms of how much sellers stand to lose if they wish to sell immediately as opposed to engaging in a costly and time-consuming search.

An example of a quite illiquid financial asset is the stock of a small corporation or the bond issued by a small school district. The market for such a security is extremely thin, and one must search for one of a very few suitable buyers. Less suitable buyers, including speculators and market makers, may be located more promptly, but they will have to be enticed to invest in the illiquid financial asset by an appropriate discount in price.

For many other financial assets, liquidity is determined by contractual arrangements. For example, ordinary deposits are perfectly liquid, because the bank has a contractual obligation to convert them at par on demand. In contrast, financial contracts representing a claim on a private pension fund may be regarded as totally illiquid, because they can be cashed only at retirement.

Liquidity may depend not only on the financial asset but also on the quantity one wishes to sell (or buy). Although a small quantity may be quite liquid, a large lot may run into illiquidity problems. Note that liquidity is again closely related to whether a market is thick or thin. Thinness always has the effect of increasing the turnaround cost, even of a liquid financial asset. But beyond some point, thinness becomes an obstacle to the formation of a market, and it has a direct effect on the illiquidity of the financial asset.

Return Predictability

Return predictability is a basic property of financial assets, in that it is a major determinant of their value. Assuming investors are risk averse, the riskiness of an asset can be equated with the uncertainty or unpredictability of its return. We will see in chapter 12 how the unpredictability of future returns can be measured and how it is related to the variability of past returns. But whatever measure of volatility is used, it is obvious that volatility varies greatly across financial assets. There are several reasons for this variability.

First, as illustrated later in this chapter, the value of a financial asset depends on the cash flow expected and on the interest rate used to discount this cash flow. Hence, volatility will be a consequence of the uncertainty about future interest rates and future cash flow. The future cash flow may be contractual, in which case the sole source of its uncertainty is the reliability of the debtor with regard to fulfilling the obligation. The cash flow may be in the nature of a residual equity claim, as is the case for the payments generated by the equity of a corporation. The cash flows from U.S. government securities are the only cash flows generally regarded as altogether riskless. Corporate debt and corporate stock cash flows are generally riskier than cash flows of U.S. government securities. Corporate equities represent a wide range of risk, from public utilities to highly speculative issues.

As for a change in interest rates, it will in principle affect all prices in the opposite direction, but the effect is much larger in the case of the price of a financial asset with a long maturity than one with a short remaining life, as illustrated later in this chapter. Thus, on this account also, short-term U.S. government securities, such as Treasury bills, tend to be the safest assets, except for cash (if properly insured). For individual stocks, the interest effect is generally swamped by cash flow uncertainty, although movements in interest rates have the characteristic of affecting all stocks in the same direction, whereas a change in expected cash flow is largely dependent on a firm's particular financial situation. In general, uncertainty about returns and future prices can be expected to increase as the investment horizon lengthens.

What has been said so far relates to the predictability of nominal returns, although the relevant measure, of course, is real returns—returns corrected for gains or losses of purchasing power attributable to inflation. Of course, if inflation is absent or small, the determinants of real and nominal uncertainty and risk coincide. But in the presence of highly unpredictable inflation

(which is usually the case with high inflation), real returns may be drastically harder to predict than nominal returns.

### Complexity

Some financial assets are complex in the sense that they are actually combinations of two or more simpler assets. To find the true value of such an asset, one must break it down into its component parts and price each separately. The sum of those prices is the value of the complex asset. A good example of a complex asset is the callable bond, that is, a bond whose issuer is entitled to repay the debt prior to the maturity date. When investors buy such a bond, they in effect buy a bond and sell to the issuer an option that allows the issuer to redeem the bond early.

A complex asset can be viewed as a bundle or package of cash flows and options belonging to either the issuer or the holder, or both. Other examples of a complex asset include a convertible bond, a bond that has payments that can be made in a different currency at the option of the bondholder, and a bond that can be sold back to the issuer at a fixed price (that is, a putable bond).

In some cases, the degree of complexity is high: Many convertible bonds are also callable, and some bonds give their issuers the right either to extend the asset's maturity or to redeem it early. Also, some Japanese firms have issued bonds that are convertible into Japanese stock (denominated in yen, of course) but that are sold for, and make coupon and principal payments in, another currency, such as U.S. dollars.

### Tax Status

An important feature of any asset is its tax status. Governmental regulations for taxing the income from the ownership or sale of financial assets vary widely, if not wildly. Tax rates differ from year to year, from country to country, and even among regional and local governments (states and municipalities in the United States) within a country. Moreover, tax rates may differ across financial assets, depending on the type of issuer, the length of time the asset is held, the nature of the owner, and so on. For example, in the United States, pension funds are exempt from income taxes (see chapter 4 for more details), and coupon payments on municipal bonds are generally free of taxation by the federal government (see chapter 21).

## Principles of Pricing Financial Assets

The fundamental principle of finance is that the true or correct price of an asset equals the present value of all cash flows that the owner of the asset expects to receive during its life. In general, the correct price for a financial asset can be expressed as follows:

$$
P = \frac{C F_{1}}{(1 + r)^{1}} + \frac{C F_{2}}{(1 + r)^{2}} + \frac{C F_{3}}{(1 + r)^{3}} + \dots + \frac{C F_{N}}{(1 + r)^{N}},
$$ where


$P =$  the price of the financial asset,

$CF_{t} =$  the cash flow in year  $t$ $(t = 1,\dots \dots ,N)$

$N =$  maturity of the financial asset, and

 $r =$  appropriate discount rate.

### The Appropriate Discount Rate

The appropriate discount rate,  $r$ , is the return that the market or the consensus of investors requires on the asset. A convenient (but approximate) expression for the appropriate discount rate is:

$$ r = R R + I P + D P + M P + L P + E P,
$$ where


$RR =$  the real rate of interest, which is the reward for not consuming and for lending to other users;

$IP =$  the inflation premium, which is the compensation for the expected decline in the purchasing power of the money lent to borrowers;

$DP =$  the default risk premium, which is the reward for taking on the risk of default in the case of a loan (or bond) or the risk of loss of principal for other assets;

$MP =$  the maturity premium, which is the compensation for lending money for long periods of time;

$LP =$  the liquidity premium, which is the reward for investing in an asset that may not be readily converted to cash at a fair market value; and

$EP =$  the exchange-rate risk premium, which is the reward for investing in an asset that is not denominated in the investor's home currency.

Obviously, the price of an asset is inversely related to its discount rate: If the discount rate rises, the price falls; and if the rate declines, the price increases.

### Illustration

Let us construct a simple example to illustrate the pricing of a financial asset. We can then use the hypothetical financial asset to illustrate some of the properties explained earlier in this chapter.

Suppose a bond has a maturity of four years and pays annual interest of \$50 at the end of each year plus a principal of \$1,000 at the conclusion of the fourth year. Because this bond pays $50 per $1,000 of principal, the periodic coupon rate is 5\%. This rate is commonly and simply referred to as the coupon rate. Thus, using the previous notation, we have

$$

N = 4 C F_{1} = \ 5 0 C F_{2} = \ 5 0 C F_{3} = \ 5 0 C F_{N} = \ 1, 0 5 0.

$$

Furthermore, assume that the market thinks the real rate is  $2.5\%$ , the inflation premium is  $3\%$ , the bond's default risk justifies a premium of  $2\%$ , the maturity premium is  $0.5\%$ , and the liquidity premium is  $1\%$ . Because the cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars, the foreign-exchange rate premium is zero. That is,

$$

R R = 2.5 \%, I P = 3.0 \%, D P = 2.0 \%, M P = 0.5 \%, L P = 1.0 \%, E P = 0 \%

$$

Thus, we have the following value for the discount rate:

$$ r = 2.5 \% + 3.0 \% + 2.0 \% + 0.5 \% + 1.0 \% + 0 \% = 9.0 \%, \text{or} 0.09.
$$

Using the formula for price, the price of this bond is

$$
\begin{array}{l} P = \frac{\mathbb {S} 5 0}{(1 . 0 9)^{1}} + \frac{\mathbb {S} 5 0}{(1 . 0 9)^{2}} + \frac{\mathbb {S} 5 0}{(1 . 0 9)^{3}} + \frac{\mathbb {S} 1 , 0 5 0}{(1 . 0 9)^{4}}. \\ = \$ 870.41 \\ \end{array}
$$

We can use this hypothetical financial asset to illustrate the effect of some of the properties of financial assets on price or asset value. First, it should be clear that the price of a financial asset changes as the appropriate discount rate,  $r$ , changes. More specifically, the price changes in the opposite direction to the change in the appropriate discount rate. An illustration of this principle appears in table 11.1, which shows the price of our hypothetical financial asset for various discount rates.

Table 11.1 Price of a four-year bond for various discount rates.

<table><tr><td colspan="4">Cash Flow:</td></tr><tr><td>CF1 = $50</td><td>CF2 = $50</td><td>CF3 = $50</td><td>CF4 = $1,050</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Appropriate Discount Rate (\%)</td><td>Price ($)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td>1,036.30</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td>1,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td></td><td></td><td>965.35</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td></td><td></td><td>932.26</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td></td><td></td><td>900.64</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td></td><td></td><td>870.41</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td></td><td></td><td>841.51</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>813.85</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td></td><td></td><td>787.39</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td></td><td></td><td>762.04</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td></td><td></td><td>737.77</td></tr></table>

Let's look at how reversibility affects an asset's value. Suppose a broker's commission of 35 is imposed by brokers to buy or sell the bond. The price of the four-year bond is then

$$
\begin{array}{l} P = - \$ 35 + \frac{\$ 50}{(1 . 0 9)^{1}} + \frac{\$ 50}{(1 . 0 9)^{2}} + \frac{\$ 50}{(1 . 0 9)^{3}} + \frac{\$ 1 , 0 5 0 - \$ 3 5}{(1 . 0 9)^{4}}. \\ = \$ 810.62 \\ \end{array}
$$

Notice that the initial commission of 35 is subtracted on an undiscounted basis, because that payment is made at the time of purchase.

Suppose also that a government entity imposes a transfer tax of 20 on each transaction. Because this rise in the cost of reversing an investment diminishes its reversibility to some extent, the present value of all cash flows associated with owning the bond now looks like:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P = - \$ 35 - \$ 20 + \frac{\$ 50}{(1 . 0 9)^{1}} + \frac{\$ 50}{(1 . 0 9)^{2}} + \frac{\$ 50}{(1 . 0 9)^{3}} + \frac{\$ 1 , 0 5 0 - \$ 3 5 - \$ 2 0}{(1 . 0 9)^{4}} \\ = \$ 7 7 6. 4 5. \\ \end{array}
$$

The change in price is significant and demonstrates why financial markets adjust so sharply (and rapidly) when governments impose restrictions on, or raise the cost of, capital market transactions.

To see how default risk affects the price of an asset, assume that, right before you bought the bond, a news story convinced investors that this bond is less risky than they had thought. So, the default risk premium falls from  $2\%$  to  $1\%$ , and the appropriate discount rate thus declines from  $9\%$  to  $8\%$ . Ignoring commissions and transfer fees, table 11.1 shows that the price would increase from  $870.41 to$ 900.64.

What about liquidity? Suppose immediately after the purchase of this bond, factors in the market for this bond cause its liquidity to decline. An investor buying this asset would plan for such a possibility by raising the liquidity premium. Assume that the liquidity premium increases from  $1\%$  to  $3\%$ . The appropriate discount rate then increases from  $9\%$  to  $11\%$ . Ignoring the commission and the transfer fee, table 11.1 shows that the price would be \$813.85. The fall in price, from the original \$870.41 to 813.85, shows how important liquidity can be.

Now, let's tackle the notion of complexity by assuming that the bond is convertible into a fixed number of shares of common stock of the company that issued the bond. The price of our four-year bond would then be greater than \$870.41 by an amount equal to the value that the market assigns to the right to convert the bond into common stock. For example, suppose we observe that the price of our hypothetical bond with the conversion privilege is \$1,000.41. This means that the conversion privilege is valued by the market at 130.

The unresolved question is whether 130 is a fair value for this conversion privilege. Valuation techniques to determine the fair value of any type of option (such as a conversion privilege) are available. It is sufficient to understand why a knowledge of how to value an option is important.

Because many financial assets have options embedded in them, failure to assess the options properly may lead to the mispricing of financial assets.

Now, let's turn our attention to currency. Suppose that this bond was issued by a German firm and that all payments are in euros. The cash flow in U.S. dollars that a U.S. investor will receive is uncertain, because the dollar-euro exchange rate will fluctuate over the four years. Suppose that the market assigns an exchange premium of  $3\%$ . As a result, the appropriate discount rate increases from  $9\%$  to  $12\%$ , and the price would be  $\$787.39$  (see table 11.1). To continue with the effect of currency risk, suppose that immediately after the purchase of this bond, the market expects that the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro will become more volatile. The market will adjust for this volatility by increasing the foreign currency risk premium, which, in turn, increases the appropriate discount rate and decreases the price.

It is easy to illustrate the impact of taxes. Suppose that our bond is granted a favorable tax treatment such that the interest and any capital gain from this bond would not be taxed. Suppose that the marginal tax rate on otherwise equivalent taxable bonds is  $33.33\%$ , and the appropriate discount rate is  $9\%$ . Then the after-tax discount rate would be approximately  $6\%$ , as shown below:

Pretax discount rate  $\times$  (1 - marginal tax rate) = 0.09  $\times$  (1 - 0.3333) = 6\%.

Because our hypothetical bond is free of taxes, the appropriate discount rate would be adjusted to compensate for this feature. The discount rate that would be used is  $6\%$ , because it is the equivalent of a  $9\%$  discount rate and a  $33.33\%$  marginal tax rate. From table 11.1, we see that the price of the bond would be 965.35.

Continuing with the importance of tax features to the price of a financial asset, suppose that immediately after the purchase of this bond, the market comes to expect that the U.S. Congress will raise the marginal tax rate. This expectation would increase the value of the tax-exempt feature by decreasing the discount rate based on the anticipated rise in the marginal tax rate. The opposite would occur if the market came to expect that the U.S. Congress would lower the marginal tax rate.

Although we have used a single discount rate to discount each cash flow, theoretical reasons suggest that this is inappropriate. Specifically, in chapter 18, we will look at the relationship between a bond's maturity and yield. In addition, a financial asset should be viewed as a package of cash flows. Each cash flow should be treated as if it were an individual asset with only one cash flow, and that cash flow has its own discount rate that depends on when it will be received. Consequently, a more general formula for pricing a financial asset is

$$
P = \frac{C F_{1}}{(1 + r_{1})^{1}} + \frac{C F_{2}}{(1 + r_{2})^{2}} + \frac{C F_{3}}{(1 + r_{3})^{3}} + \dots + \frac{C F_{N}}{(1 + r_{N})^{N}},
$$ where  $r_t$  is the discount rate appropriate for period  $t$ .


# Price Volatility of Financial Assets

As table 11.1 makes clear, a fundamental pricing principle is that a financial asset's price changes in the opposite direction of the change in the required rate of return. We refer to the required rate of return as the required yield. This principle follows from the fact that the price of a financial asset is equal to the present value of its cash flow. An increase (decrease) in the yield required by investors decreases (increases) the present value of the cash flow and, therefore, the financial asset's price.

The price sensitivity of a financial asset to a change in the required yield will not be the same for all assets. For example, an increase in the required yield of one percentage point may result in a decline in one asset's price of  $20\%$ , but only of  $3\%$  for another. In this section, we will see how the characteristics of a financial asset and the level of interest rates affect the price responsiveness of a financial asset to a change in the required yield. We also present a measure that can be used to gauge the approximate price sensitivity of a financial asset to changes in the required yield.

Note that the analysis in this section applies fully and directly to bonds and other financial assets that have known expected cash flows and known expected maturities. An analysis of the price sensitivity of other major financial assets, such as preferred stock and common stock (which are perpetuals and have uncertain cash flows), must be postponed to a later chapter.

In our discussion, we will refer to changes in the required yield. It is convenient to measure a change in yield in terms of what market participants refer to as a basis point rather than in terms of a percentage change. One basis point is defined as 0.0001, or equivalently,  $0.01\%$ . Therefore, 100 basis points is equal to one percentage point, and a yield change from  $9\%$  to  $10\%$  represents a 100 basis point change in yield. A yield change from  $7\%$  to  $7.5\%$  is a 50 basis point change, and a yield change from  $6\%$  to  $8.35\%$  is a 235 basis point change in yield.

# The Effect of Maturity

An asset's maturity is a factor that affects its price sensitivity to a change in yield. In fact, a bond's price sensitivity to a change in the discount rate is positively related to the bond's maturity. Consider the case of two bonds that have the same coupon rate and the same required yield but different maturities. If the required rate were to change, the price sensitivity of the bond with the longer maturity would be greater than that of the bond with the shorter maturity.

An illustration of this link between maturity and price change appears in table 11.2, which shows the price of a bond that pays  \$50 annually and\$ 1,000 at maturity—a 5\% coupon rate—for various maturities and discount rates. Table 11.3, which is based on table 11.2, shows the differences across maturities in a bond's dollar price decline and percentage price decline for an increase in the discount rate of 100 basis points. For example, if the discount rate rises from 9\% to 10\%, the price of a four-year bond falls from  $870.41 to$ 841.51, which represents a price decline of  \$28.90 and a percentage price decline of 3.32\%. In contrast, a similar rise in the discount rate causes the price of a 20-year bond to fall considerably more, from$ 634.86 to $574.32, which represents a price decline of \$60.54 and a percentage price decline of 9.54\%.

A bond's coupon rate also affects its price sensitivity. More specifically, for two bonds with the same maturity and required yield, the lower the coupon rate is, the greater the price responsiveness will be for a given change in the required yield.

To illustrate this, consider a 5\% coupon bond and a 10\% coupon bond, each of which has a maturity of 15 years and a principal of \$1,000. If the required yield for both bonds is 9\%, the price of the 5\% coupon bond would be \$677.57, and the price of the 10\% coupon bond would be \$1,080.61. If the required yield increases by 100 basis points, from 9\% to 10\%, the price of the 5\% coupon bond would fall to \$619.70, whereas the price of the 10\% coupon bond would fall to \$1,000. Thus, the 5\% coupon bond's price declines by \$57.87 or 8.5\% ($57.87/$677.57), and the 10\% coupon bond's price declines by \$80.61 or by 7.5\% (\$80.61/1,080.61). Although the dollar price change is greater for the higher-coupon bond, the percentage price change is less.

In later chapters, we will discuss a special type of bond, one with no coupon rate. This is called a zero-coupon bond. The investor who purchases a zero-coupon bond receives no periodic interest payment. Instead, the investor purchases the bond at a price below its principal and receives the principal at the maturity date. The difference between the principal and the price at which the zero-coupon bond is purchased represents interest earned by the investor over the bond's life. For example, consider a zero-coupon bond with a principal of  \$1,000 and a maturity of 15 years. If the required yield is 9\%$ , then the price of this bond would be 274.54. $^{8}$  The difference between the principal of \$1,000 and the price of \$274.54 is the interest that the investor realizes at the maturity date.

A zero-coupon bond will have greater price sensitivity than a bond with a coupon rate selling at the same required yield and with the same maturity. For example, consider once again the 15-year zero-coupon bond. If the required yield increases from 9\% to 10\%, the price of this bond would fall to \$239.39, a percentage price decline of 12.8\% (\$35.15/274.54). This percentage change is greater than the declines in price for the 15-year maturity 5\% coupon and 15-year 10\% coupon bonds.

Tables 11.2 and 11.3 also bring out another interesting property about asset prices. Notice that, for a given maturity, the dollar price change and the percentage price change are higher for the lower initial discount rates than for the higher initial discount rates. For example, consider the 15-year bond when the discount rate is 5\%. The price of the bond falls from $1,000 to $902.88 when the discount rate increases from 5\% to 6\%, a price decline of \$97.20 and a percentage price decline of 9.72\%. In contrast, a rise in the discount rate of 100 basis points from 13\% to 14\% reduces the same bond's price by \$35.81 (from $483.01 to $447.20) and by the percentage of 7.41\%.

The implication is that the lower the level of yields is, the greater the effect a change in interest rates will have on the price of a financial asset.

Measuring Price Sensitivity to Interest Rate Changes: Duration

From our discussion thus far, we see that three factors affect the price sensitivity of an asset to changes in interest rates: the maturity, the coupon rate, and the level of interest rates. When managing the price sensitivity of a portfolio, market participants seek a measure of the sensitivity of assets to interest rate changes that encompasses all three factors.

A useful way to approximate an asset's price sensitivity to interest rate changes is to examine how the price changes if the yield changes by a small number of basis points. To do this, we use the following notation:

$\Delta y =$  change in yield (in decimal),

$P_{0} =$  initial price of the asset,

$P_{-} =$  asset's price if the yield is decreased by  $\Delta y$ , and

$P_{+} =$  asset's price if the yield is increased by  $\Delta y$ .

Then, for a small decrease in yield, the percentage price change is

$$

\frac{P_{-} - P_{0}}{P_{0}}.

$$

The percentage price change per basis point change is found by dividing the percentage price change by the number of basis points ( $\Delta y$  times 100). That is,

$$

\frac{P_{-} - P_{0}}{P_{0} (\Delta y) 1 0 0}.

$$

Similarly, the percentage price change per basis point increase in yield is  $\frac{P_0 - P_+}{P_0(\Delta y)100}$ .

The percentage price change for an increase and decrease in interest rates will not be the same. Consequently, the average percentage price change per basis point change in yield can be calculated. This is done as follows:

$$

\frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{P_{-} - P_{0}}{P_{0} (\Delta y) 1 0 0} + \frac{P_{0} - P_{+}}{P_{0} (\Delta y) 1 0 0} \right],

$$ or equivalently,


$$

\frac{P_{-} - P_{+}}{2 P_{0} (\Delta y) 1 0 0}.

$$

The approximate percentage price change for a 100-basis-point change in yield is found by multiplying the previous formula by 100:

$$

\frac{P_{-} - P_{+}}{2 P_{0} (\Delta y)}.

$$

For example, the price of a 5\% coupon bond with a principal of \$1,000 and a maturity of 15 years is \$677.57. If the yield is increased by 50 basis points from 9\% to 9.5\%, the price would be \$647.73. If the yield is decreased by 50 basis points from 9\% to 8.5\%, the price would be \$709.35. Thus, we have the following values:

$$

\Delta y = 0. 0 0 5,

$$

$$

P_{0} = \$ 6 7 7. 5 7,

$$

$$

P_{-} = \$ 709.35, a n d

$$

$$

P_{+} = \$ 647.73.

$$

The application of the foregoing formula provides this number:

$$

\frac{\mathbb {S} 7 0 9 . 3 5 - \mathbb {S} 6 4 7 . 7 3}{2 (\mathbb {S} 6 7 7 . 5 7) (0 . 0 0 5)} = 9. 0 9.

$$

This measure of price sensitivity is popularly referred to as duration—a concept we introduced in chapter 6 when discussing the interest rate risk of a depository institution. Table 11.4 shows how the duration is determined for a  $5\%$  coupon bond with different maturities when the interest rate is initially at  $9\%$ .


Table 11.4 Determination of duration for a  $5 \%$ coupon bond with a principal of \$1,000 and an initial required yield of  $9 \%$

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="4">Number of Years to Maturity</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Price at 9\% (P0)</td><td>$870.41</td><td>$743.29</td><td>$677.57</td><td>$634.86</td></tr><tr><td>Price at 9.5\% (P+)</td><td>$855.80</td><td>$717.45</td><td>$647.73</td><td>$603.44</td></tr><tr><td>Price at 8.5\% (P-)</td><td>$885.35</td><td>$770.35</td><td>$709.35</td><td>$668.78</td></tr><tr><td>Duration</td><td>3.40</td><td>7.12</td><td>9.09</td><td>10.29</td></tr><tr><td>Duration = P- - P+ / 2(P0)(0.005)</td><td>3.40</td><td>7.12</td><td>9.09</td><td>10.29</td></tr></table>

Table 11.5 shows the duration for three coupon bonds with different maturities, assuming different initial yields. As can be seen from this table, the relative magnitude of duration is consistent with the properties described earlier. Specifically, (1) for bonds with the same coupon rate and the same yield, the longer the maturity is, the greater the duration will be; (2) for bonds with the same maturity and at the same yield, the lower the coupon rate is, the greater the duration will be; and (3) the lower the initial yield is, the greater the duration will be for a given bond. Thus, duration picks up the effect of all three factors: maturity, coupon rate, and initial level of yield.

Duration is related to the price sensitivity as follows:

Approximate percentage change in a financial asset's price  $= -\text{Duration} \times (\text{Yieldchangeindecimalform}) \times 100$ .

For example, suppose that the required yield on the  $5\%$  coupon, 15-year bond increases from  $9\%$  to  $10\%$  (0.01 in decimal form). Then, because this bond's duration is 9.09:

Approximate percentage change in price  $= -9.09 \times (0.01) \times 100 = -9.09\%$ .

We showed earlier that the actual percentage change in price if the required yield increases from  $9\%$  to  $10\%$  would be a fall of  $8.5\%$ . Thus, duration is a close approximation of the percentage price change. The approximation is better for smaller changes in the required yield. For example, if the required yield changes by 20 basis points (0.002 in decimal form) from  $9\%$  to  $9.20\%$  rather than 100 basis points, then based on duration, the approximate percentage change in price would be  $-1.82\%$ . The actual price if the required yield increased by 20 basis points is  \$665.41, a decline of\$ 12.16 from the price of $677.57 at  $9\%$ . The actual percentage price change is therefore  $-1.79\% (-\$ 12.16 / \$677.57)$ . Duration does an excellent job of approximating the percentage price change in this case.

In general, one can interpret duration as follows: the approximate percentage change in price for a 100-basis-point change in interest rates around the prevailing yield. Duration does a good job of approximating the price change for a small change in yield (on the order of 50 basis points in either direction). The larger the yield change is, the poorer will be the approximation that duration provides.


Although we have developed duration in the context of bonds, note that the basic principle applies equally to other financial assets. For example, consider a financial asset whose cash flow is as follows:

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Cash Flow</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>$30</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>$75</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>$140</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>$200</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>$250</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>300</td></tr></table>

Suppose that the appropriate discount rate is  $7\%$ . Then the price of this financial asset would be \$794.31. If the yield were decreased by 50 basis points to  $6.5\%$ , the price would be \$812.82. If the yield were increased by 50 basis points to  $7.5\%$ , the price would be 776.36. Thus, for this financial asset, we know that

$$

\Delta y = 0. 0 0 5,

$$

$$

P_{0} = \$ 7 9 4. 3 1,

$$

$$

P_{-} = \$ 812.82, a n d

$$

$$

P_{+} = \$ 7 7 6. 3 6.

$$

The duration is then 4.59, calculated as follows:

$$

\frac{\mathbb {S} 8 1 2 . 8 2 - \mathbb {S} 7 7 6 . 3 6}{2 (\mathbb {S} 7 9 4 . 3 1) (0 . 0 0 5)} = 4. 5 9.

$$

Although we have focused on the price sensitivity of individual financial assets to changes in interest rates, we can extend the principle to a portfolio of financial assets. The duration of a portfolio of assets is simply the weighted average of the duration of the individual assets. The weight used for each asset is its market value in the portfolio.

Moreover, the principle can be extended to a liability stream. A liability can be viewed as a financial asset with a negative cash flow. The present value of the cash outlays is equal to the value or price of the liability stream. When interest rates change, the value of the liability stream changes. A duration of a liability stream can be calculated in the same way as the duration of a financial asset.

Importance of Measuring Price Sensitivity to Interest Rate Changes

The importance of being able to measure the sensitivity of an individual asset, a portfolio of assets, and a liability cannot be overemphasized. To control interest rate risk, it is necessary to be able to measure it. An investor with a portfolio of assets wants to be able to measure her exposure to interest rate changes in order to assess whether the exposure is acceptable. If it is not, she can alter the exposure. Various instruments that we describe later in this book provide a means for doing so. Financial institutions manage assets against liabilities. The interest rate risk exposure of a financial institution is the difference between the duration of its assets and the duration of its liabilities.

From our discussion, it may seem simple to calculate the duration of an asset. Unfortunately, this is not the case, because for most assets, the cash flow can change when interest rates change. In our illustrations, we have assumed that when interest rates change, the cash flows are unchanged. However, as we describe the various financial instruments in later chapters, we will see that as interest rates change, either the issuer or the investor can alter the cash flow. Consequently, if a change in the cash flow is not considered when interest rates change, the duration calculation can be misleading.

When a duration is calculated under the assumption that the cash flows do not change when interest rates change, the resulting duration is called modified duration. In contrast, a duration calculated assuming that the cash flow changes when interest rates change is called effective duration. For some assets, the difference between modified duration and effective duration can be quite dramatic. For example, with some of the more complex financial instruments discussed later in this book, the modified duration could be four, whereas the effective duration could be 25! In this case, an investor might believe that the price of the asset will change by approximately  $4\%$  for a 100 basis point change in interest rates (modified duration) when, in fact, it would change by approximately  $25\%$  for a 100-basis-point change in interest rates (effective duration).


# Macaulay Duration

The term "duration" was first used in 1938 by Frederick Macaulay as a measure of the weighted average time to maturity of a bond. It can be shown that the measure Macaulay developed is related to the price sensitivity of a bond to interest rate changes. Unfortunately, too many market participants interpret duration as some measure of average life instead of a measure of price sensitivity to interest rate changes. This misinterpretation has been a key factor in several financial blunders. For example, for some complex financial assets, the effective duration is greater than the Macaulay duration. Market participants who interpret duration as a measure of the average life of an asset find this difficult to believe.

Consequently, when you hear the term "duration" used, interpret it as a measure of price sensitivity to rate changes, not some measure of the asset's average life. In addition, understand what type of duration measure is being used, effective duration or modified duration. Effective duration is the appropriate measure. Finally, if someone you know thinks that Macaulay duration means something for managing a portfolio or the asset/liability position of a financial institution, photocopy this page and tell them to review this discussion!

# Key Points
- A financial asset has many properties, and each affects the asset's value in a distinctive and important way.
- Some properties are intrinsic to the asset, such as its maturity or promised cash flow.
- Other properties are features of the market for the asset, such as the costs of trading the asset.
- Still other properties reflect decisions by government about the asset's tax status.
- A complex asset is one that provides options for the issuer or the investor, or both, and so represents a combination of simpler assets.
- An asset's price is the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted at an appropriate rate.
- The appropriate discount rate for an asset's cash flows depends on the properties of the asset.
- The appropriate discount rate can often be approximated as the sum of rewards for the various risks an asset poses to its buyer.
- The price of an asset moves in the opposite direction of a change in its discount rate.
- The price of a complex asset is the sum of the prices of its component parts.
- Assets have different degrees of price sensitivity to a change in the discount rate or required yield.
- Factors that influence an asset's price sensitivity include its maturity, its coupon rate, and the initial level of the required yield.
- The longer an asset's maturity is, the greater will be its price sensitivity to a change in the discount rate, other things being equal.
- The larger an asset's coupon rate is, the lower will be its price sensitivity to a change in the discount rate, other things being equal.
- The lower the initial discount rate is, the greater will be the price sensitivity of most assets to a change in that rate.
- Duration is a measure of price sensitivity that incorporates maturity, coupon, and level of yield; it provides an approximation of the percentage price change for small changes in yield.
- It is important to be able to measure the price sensitivity of an asset or liability to interest rate changes, and the appropriate measure is the effective duration.

1. Your broker is recommending that you purchase U.S. government bonds. Here is the explanation: "Listen, in these times of uncertainty, with many companies going bankrupt, it makes sense to play it safe and purchase long-term government bonds. They are issued by the U.S. government, so they are risk free."

How would you respond to the broker?

2. You just inherited 30,000 shares of a company you have never heard of, ABD Corporation. You call your broker to find out whether you have finally struck it rich. After several minutes, she comes back on the telephone and says: "I don't have a clue about these shares. It's too bad they are not traded in a financial market. That would make life a lot easier for you." What does she mean?
 3. Suppose you own a bond that pays \$75 yearly in coupon interest and is likely to be called in two years (because the firm has already announced that it will redeem the issue early). The call price will be \$1,050. What is the price of your bond now, in the market, if the appropriate discount rate for this asset is 9\%?
 4. Your broker has advised you to buy shares of Hungry Boy Fast Foods, which has paid a dividend of \$1.00 per year for 10 years and will (according to the broker) continue to do so for many years. The broker believes that the stock, which now has a price of \$12, will be worth 25 per share in five years. You have good reason to think that the discount rate for this firm's stock is 22\% per year, because that rate compensates the buyer for all pertinent risks. Is the stock's present price a good approximation of its true financial value?
 5. You have been considering a zero-coupon bond, which pays no interest but will pay a principal of \$1,000 at the end of five years. The price of the bond is now \$712.99, and its required rate of return is 7.0\%. This morning's news contained a surprising development. The government announced that the rate of inflation appears to be 5.5\% instead of the 4\% that most people had been expecting. (Suppose most people had thought the real rate of interest was 3\%). What would be the price of the bond, once the market began to absorb this new information about inflation?

6. State the difference in basis points between each of the following: a.  $5.5\%$  and  $6.5\%$

b.  $7\%$  and  $9\%$ c.  $6.4\%$  and  $7.8\%$
d.  $9.1\%$  and  $11.9\%$

7. a. Does a rise of 100 basis points in the discount rate change the price of a 20-year bond as much as it changes the price of a four-year bond, assuming that both bonds have the same coupon rate and offer the same yield?

b. Does a rise of 100 basis points in the discount rate change the price of a  $4\%$  coupon bond as much as it changes the price of a  $10\%$  coupon bond, assuming that both bonds have the same maturity and offer the same yield?
c. Does a rise of 100 basis points in the discount rate change the price of a 10-year bond to the same extent if the discount rate is  $4\%$  as it does if the discount rate is  $12\%$ ?

8. During the early 1980s, interest rates for many long-term bonds were above  $14\%$ . In the early 1990s, rates on similar bonds were far lower. What do you think this dramatic decline in market interest rates means for the price volatility of bonds in response to a change in interest rates?
 9. a. What is the cash flow of a 6\% coupon bond that pays interest annually, matures in seven years, and has a principal of 1,000?

b. Assuming a discount rate of  $8\%$ , what is the price of this bond?
c. Assuming a discount rate of  $8.5\%$ , what is the price of this bond?
d. Assuming a discount rate of  $7.5\%$ , what is the price of this bond?
e. What is the duration of this bond, assuming that the price is the one you calculated in part (b)?
f. If the yield changes by 100 basis points, from  $8\%$  to  $7\%$ , by how much would you approximate the percentage price change to be, using your estimate of duration in part (e)?
g. What is the actual percentage price change if the yield changes by 100 basis points?

10. Why is it important to be able to estimate the duration of a bond or bond portfolio?
11. Explain why you agree or disagree with the following statement: "Determining the duration of a financial asset is a simple process."
12. Explain why the effective duration is a more appropriate measure of a complex financial instrument's price sensitivity to interest rate changes than is modified duration.
