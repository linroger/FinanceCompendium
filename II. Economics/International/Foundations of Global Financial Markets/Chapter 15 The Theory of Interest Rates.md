An interest rate is the percentage of the amount loaned that the borrower agrees to pay the lender in a loan agreement each year. For example, suppose that a bank agrees to loan a consumer 20,000 for four years and the lending arrangement calls for an interest rate of 5\% per year and repayment of the loan amount (20,000) at the end of the four years. Then each year, the consumer pays interest to the bank of 5\% times the 20,000, or 1,000, per year. Basically, an interest rate is the cost of borrowing money from a lender and the compensation to the lender for loaning money. This concept of an interest rate is not new to modern economies. Interest rates have a long history. Here is a sample of estimated interest rates over the past 5,000 years: 20\% in Mesopotamia (around 3000 BC), Babylon (1772 BC), and Italian cities (about AD 1150); about 8\% in Rome in 443 BC, Athens and Rome ca. 300–200 BC, Holland in the 1570s, and the United States in the 1870s. Since 2008 (the beginning of the global financial crisis), interest rates around the world have been at historically low levels. In fact, in some countries, interest rates have been negative! That is, the borrower is charging the lender for holding money.

In this chapter, we describe a theory of interest rates that offers an explanation of what determines the level of interest rates. In doing so, we focus on the one interest rate that can be said to provide the anchor for other rates—the short-term, riskless, real rate. By real rate, we mean the rate that would prevail in the economy if price levels remained constant and were expected to be constant indefinitely. We then look at three important issues. The first is what is meant by a riskless interest rate. Is there a financial instrument that provides a positive interest rate without any risk? Second, we look at negative interest rates and discuss whether there is a lower bound on that rate. Finally, we look at alternative interest rates measures that can be used as the benchmark interest rate in the economy. In chapter 16, we describe the structure of interest rates. There is no single interest rate for all loan arrangements in an economy. The interest rate offered on a particular loan depends on a myriad of factors related to the type of borrower (the issuer in the case of a bond), the characteristics of the loan arrangement, and the state of the economy.

To understand what determines the basic rate, we must inquire why some people might decide not to consume all their current resources (i.e., to save) and why others want to invest. Those desirous of borrowing might want to use the proceeds either to make further loans (i.e., acquire financial assets) or to invest (i.e., acquire income-yielding physical assets, such as a plant, equipment, or residential structures). In our discussion, we abstract from financial intermediaries and assume that all loans directly or indirectly end up being transferred to an investor.

Economists have developed theories of interest rates. The major theories were formulated in the books written by two economists: an Austrian economist, Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, in 1884, $^{1}$  and an American economist, Irving Fisher, in 1930. $^{2}$  We'll start with the theory of interest rates as set forth by Fisher and then explain Böhm-Bawerk's theory. $^{3}$

To begin, let's define what is meant by "saving." Saving reflects primarily the choice between current consumption and future consumption. To understand that choice (and all consumer choices), we need to consider two fundamental concepts: preference and opportunity.

Preferences for Current versus Future Consumption

Consider first the representation of preferences. Suppose that our consumer is to choose among a variety of "baskets" (or "bundles"), where each basket consists of a certain quantity of current consumption and a certain quantity of future consumption.

Preferences (or tastes) can then be described fully by a complete preference ranking of all the relevant baskets. Insofar as the amount of current and future consumption can vary by any small dose, some choices among the possible baskets will be ranked equally; that is, the consumer will be indifferent as to certain choices among baskets.

This consideration makes it possible to obtain an effective representation of preference, as shown in figure 15.1. The figure measures current consumption  $(C_1)$  along the horizontal axis and future consumption  $(C_2)$  along the vertical axis. Hence, any point in the diagram represents a commodity basket, such as  $H$ . Some other points,  $H^*$ , represents an indifferent choice to  $H$ ; more generally, a curve from  $H$  to  $H^*$  and beyond consists of baskets indifferent to both  $H$  and  $H^*$ . Such a curve is called an indifference curve. The indifference curve in figure 15.1 is labeled  $u$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/23669622-4e61-4759-9866-61562641cd84/baa0c75e449991f91f5b62bbfcc2a503713c92198fc9c396ce51ca13ab3b264d.jpg)

Figure 15.1 Indifference curve between current and future consumption.

Note that an indifference curve goes through every point in the diagram, although the indifference curves cannot intersect, because that would imply that a given basket is ranked both higher and lower than another—a clear inconsistency. The indifference curve  $u$  here falls from left to right, because both consumption now and consumption later can be taken to be desirable. As basket  $H$  in figure 15.1 includes more current consumption than basket  $H^*$ , for it to be indifferent from basket  $H^*$ , basket  $H$  must have less future consumption,  $C_2$ .

The reason the curve is drawn convex with respect to the origin is the assumption that, as the consumer gives up successive equal amounts of current consumption, more future consumption will be needed to make up for the loss of an additional unit. This assumption appears reasonable, although a complete justification of it is beyond the scope of this chapter

At any point on an indifference curve, we can draw a tangent to the curve. Fisher refers to the slope of this tangent as the marginal rate of time preference. It measures how much additional consumption next period is needed to compensate the consumer for the loss of a unit of consumption now. That is, the slope of the tangent measures the marginal rate of substitution between current and future consumption.

We might conjecture that a particular person would be impatient to consume now rather than later, and therefore it would take more than one unit tomorrow to induce that person to give up the enjoyment of one unit today. In other words, the marginal rate of time preference, or the slope of the indifference curve, would be larger than 1. For this reason, Fisher proposed labeling the excess of the slope over unity a "measure of impatience."

It turns out, however, that this conjecture about the slope is wrong. It is easy to verify that the slope of the indifference curve changes as we move along it, and therefore that it is most unlikely to be everywhere greater than unity. On the left side of the diagram, where today's endowment is small, the slope can be counted on to be larger than unity. However, as we move to the right, and the current endowment grows larger relative to the future one, the slope must become smaller than 1, meaning that the consumer may be willing to give up a unit of today's abundant supply for less than one unit to add to tomorrow's scarce supply. This insight is important for understanding why interest rates can in principle be negative.

# Opportunity in the Loan Market

To understand saving behavior, we need to look at how preferences interact with opportunities. Let's first consider a case in which the opportunities (or baskets among which a person can choose) are defined by (1) an initial endowment of the commodity now and later and (2) a loan market where individuals are free to exchange this initial or current endowment for a different one by lending or borrowing at a fixed exchange rate of  $R = 1 + r$  units of the commodity in the next period (i.e., the future in our illustration) per unit of the commodity loaned in the current period.  $R$  is the gross return (principal plus interest), and  $r$  is the net return, or interest rate. For example, if a unit of current consumption is loaned at  $5\%$ , then  $r = 0.05$  and  $R = 1.05$ .

We represent this opportunity locus in figure 15.2 by means of the negatively sloped straight line  $mm$  going through the endowment basket at point  $B$  (with current endowment as  $Y_{1}$  and future endowment as  $Y_{2}$ ). We refer to the opportunity locus in the loan market as the "market line." It slopes downward, because to get more  $C_{1}$ , you must reduce  $C_{2}$ . It is a straight line, because at any point on it, by giving up one unit of current consumption, we can get the same additional amount,  $R$ , of future consumption. And it goes through  $B$ , because if no lending made current consumption equal to the current endowment of  $Y_{1}$ , then future consumption would equal the future endowment of  $Y_{2}$ . Thus, the opportunity locus must include point  $B$ .

Figure 15.2 Representation of opportunity locus in the loan market (the market line).

Now let us add to the diagram a family of indifference curves, as shown in figure 15.3. One curve in the diagram is tangent to the market line, such as curve  $u_4$  at point  $D$ . The consumption basket corresponding to point  $D$  can be shown to be the preferred one among all those available, given the market line; hence it will be the chosen basket.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/23669622-4e61-4759-9866-61562641cd84/f9be3842112514a41fb7cbbb7ce21b92b9572b3d1df03a805581831a3546a591.jpg)

Figure 15.3 Family of indifference curves and the market line.

Following this logic, suppose the consumer started by considering point  $H$  on indifference curve  $u_{2}$ , where current consumption is greater than at  $D$ . Suppose next he considered giving up some current consumption in favor of more future consumption along his market opportunity line. He would first reach point  $F$  and would find it a preferable choice, being on a higher indifference curve,  $u_{3}$ . Continuing, he would reach point  $D$  on  $u_{4}$ , offering yet higher utility. But beyond  $D$ , he would immediately start reaching lower and lower utility curves, such as curves  $u_{2}$  and  $u_{3}$ . We see that the point of tangency of the market line to an indifference curve provides the best of all feasible choices.

Recalling that the slope of an indifference curve at any point measures the marginal rate of substitution between current and future consumption, we see that at the chosen point, the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the market rate  $R$  (or the marginal rate of impatience, equal to  $r$ ). It is an important property of a perfect market that, because everybody is confronted with the same market rate  $r$ , everybody at the chosen point must exhibit the same degree of impatience. In particular, if  $r$  is positive (as it generally is in our type of economy), everybody will be impatient; that is, everybody will be willing to give up a unit of current consumption to lend more only if they can get  $1 + r$  units later, with  $r > 0$ , because that opportunity is offered by the market.

Economic Forces Affecting the Market Rate

So far, we have assumed that the market rate  $r$  is a given. But what in fact determines  $r$  in this simple economy? The answer, of course, is demand and supply. For any given market rate,  $R$ , each person will decide how much to consume now and how much to save or dissave (the difference between the current endowment and consumption). In this simple economy, saving or dissaving is the same as lending or borrowing. By summing up the net lending of each participant, for each  $R$ , we obtain a supply curve for loans, such as the one graphed in figure 15.4. We draw it as initially rising from left to right, on the commonly held assumption that net lending will rise as  $R$  rises. For sufficiently low  $R$ , net lending is negative, because borrowing would exceed lending. We'll suppose zero investment at the outset. Then market equilibrium requires that net lending be zero. It therefore occurs at point  $E$ , where the curve cuts the horizontal axis. (Note that we draw the net lending curve as declining in the rightmost section. We discuss the reason for this behavior later.)

Figure 15.4

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/23669622-4e61-4759-9866-61562641cd84/4b165b029474fbc75d62cd730cf4a2f9bb5e646d03aa6355b61b660d5c24af94.jpg)

Supply curve for loans.

The market rate  $R$  reflects two major forces: the time preferences of participants and their endowments. More impatience tends to make for a smaller supply of loans (saving) at any given  $R$  and to lower the supply curve in figure 15.4, thereby shifting  $E$  to the right. A large endowment of the current commodity relative to the future makes people more eager to lend, raises the curve, and thus reduces  $R$ . If the curve is raised sufficiently,  $E$  may be pushed to the left until it is less than unity, and therefore  $r$  will become negative. This point may seem paradoxical, but it is important to understand that no opportunity of transferring resources to the future through investment (or money, which is disregarded) exists outside of lending and borrowing.

# Carryover through Investment

We now enlarge the model to allow for the possibility of investments—a productive process through which, by using current resources as an input, we obtain an output of future commodities. An investment opportunity locus might look something like the curve  $tt$  in figure 15.5, which is referred to as the transformation curve or the production function. It rises from left to right on the assumption that as more is invested, more future output will result. It is convex from below on the customary assumption of decreasing returns to scale (although increasing returns are possible in some regions without changing the argument). The slope of the transformation curve measures the marginal productivity of capital.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/23669622-4e61-4759-9866-61562641cd84/222e9066bab53a22351fc27c3f5fb20858905270fb36ea446ad2ec565efa2a88.jpg)

# Consumer Choices

The consumer faces several decisions regarding (1) how much to invest, (2) how much to lend (or borrow), and (3) how much to consume now and later. But only two of these choices are independent: Because current resources are given, once a person has decided how much to consume and invest, net lending will be determined uniquely by income minus the two other expenditures. Similarly, net borrowing and investment, together with the future endowment, uniquely fix future consumption.

Let's consider first the decision as to how much to invest. As the consumer's "income" (or what she has available to spend on consumption now and later) is limited by the sum of her endowment and any profits she may derive from her production opportunity, a necessary condition to achieve the best feasible consumption is to ensure for herself as large a profit as possible. To see how this result can be achieved, look again at figure 15.5. Recall that profit at any output (or input) is the difference between the output produced with the input (or investment) and the cost of the input. The output for any investment is given by the curve  $tt$  in figure 15.5.

What about the cost? Let us suppose initially that the owner of a firm must borrow the entire amount needed to finance the investment. In that case, clearly the cost of any given investment will be what is to be repaid next period, namely, the amount borrowed times the gross market rate  $R$ . This cost can be represented in figure 15.6 by a straight line with slope  $R$  going through the origin, and as shown in figure 15.6 by the line  $MM$ . Thus, the profit for any output is the difference between the curve  $tt$  and the line  $MM$ , which is illustrated in figure 15.6 for an assumed investment of  $X_{1}^{*}$ . We refer to the line  $MM$  in the figure as the "cost line." Because it represents the cost of borrowing, however, it has the same slope (in absolute value) as the market line in figure 15.2.

Figure 15.6

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/23669622-4e61-4759-9866-61562641cd84/86c8a7452937926f8fa7dee9a6d9d37242d8d638cc9932758a2f996b34ff8180.jpg)

Measuring the profit from investing.

As the consumer increases investment from an investment of zero (at the origin), we can see from the graph that profits initially rise (provided there are profits at all). The additional profit attributable to increased investment gets smaller and smaller, though, until it reaches a point in the figure of no more incremental profit. This point is shown as point  $A$  in figure 15.7. If the consumer continues to expand investment still further, the profit (as measured by the vertical distance between the cost line  $MM$  and the transformation curve  $tt$ ) becomes smaller and smaller. Point  $A$ 's one distinguishing characteristic is that it is where the curve  $tt$  has precisely the same slope  $R$  as the cost curve  $MM$ , as shown in figure 15.8. We draw through  $A$  a line  $mm$  with the same slope as  $R$  (and hence parallel to  $MM$ ). This line is tangent to  $tt$  at  $A$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/23669622-4e61-4759-9866-61562641cd84/b383e72b5360f009a7ac69d528686e4126b3317c4fbc658e1811fea32b573204.jpg)

Profit maximization and the cost line.

Because the slope of  $tt$  represents the marginal productivity of capital, we can conclude that the optimum rate of investment for the firm is where the marginal productivity of capital  $M$  equals the market gross rate  $R$  or, equivalently, where the additional output that can be obtained from an additional unit of input is just equal to the cost of borrowing that additional unit of input (and the amount obtained by further increases in investment is less than the cost of borrowing).

We can now proceed to examine the consumption decision and its interaction with the investment decision. To this end, we first show in figure

15.9 how the transformation curve, curve  $tt$  in figure 15.5, would be represented if graphed on the earlier figures 15.1 through 15.3. We obtain the transformation curve (production function), curve  $tt$ , in figure 15.9 by rotating the curve  $tt$  in figure 15.5 by 180 degrees and shifting the origin to point  $B$ , which represents the initial endowment as in figure 15.2. The resulting curve is the locus of all achievable baskets of current and future commodity available to the person through a combination of the initial endowment and the transformation opportunity.

Figure 15.9 Transformation curve imposed on current and future consumption graph.

The amount invested is shown in figure 15.9 along the horizontal axis by the difference between the current endowment  $Y_{1}$  and the point on the horizontal axis corresponding to any point on the transformation curve, which is illustrated in figure 15.10. At point  $W$ , the corresponding value on the horizontal axis is  $I^{W}$ , and the amount of the investment is the difference between  $Y_{1}$  and  $I^{W}$ . Future consumption corresponding to the point  $W$  on the transformation curve is  $C_2^W$ , which consists of the future endowment  $Y_{2}$  plus the profit from the investment as measured by the difference between  $C_2^W$  and  $Y_{2}$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/23669622-4e61-4759-9866-61562641cd84/3a6b04dc19aabfad6348532a49d1b3a08bb7d38c6b5473db480a83f6208d619b.jpg)

Figure 15.10 Measuring investment and profit from investment.

Suppose for a moment that no market permitted an exchange of  $C_1$  with  $C_2$ . Then the curve  $tt$  in figure 15.10 would represent the household opportunity locus. The person's best choice, the basket  $(C_1, C_2)$ , would then be found at a point of tangency of that curve with an indifference curve. But in a market economy, the budget constraint does not come from the initial endowment  $B$  in figure 15.2, or from the initial endowment enlarged by the transformation function, as in figure 15.9, but instead from the endowment plus the profit that can be earned through the production and sale of  $C_2$ . It follows that to maximize satisfaction, the individual's should, to begin with, maximize the profits obtained from the transformation activity. This maximization will yield a new budget equation that includes the best choice of basket  $(C_1, C_2)$ .

This optimal decision is shown graphically in figure 15.11. Point  $A$  on the transformation function curve  $tt$  is such that the slope is equal to the slope of the market line  $mm$ . We know that this point (which corresponds to point  $A$  in figure 15.8) represents the amount of investment  $(Y_1 - X_1^0)$  and output  $(X_2^0)$  that will maximize profits. Through point  $A$ , a new budget line  $mm$  (again tangent to  $tt$  at  $A$ ) represents the outcome of adding maximum profits to the endowment in figure 15.11. The utility-maximizing basket will then be at a point of tangency of this profit-augmented budget line to an indifference curve, such as point  $C^0$ .

Figure 15.11 Optimal investment and borrowing decisions.

A most important property resulting from the existence of a perfect loan market, together with a transformation, is that it separates the current consumption decision from current income by opening up the possibility of saving and dissaving through transformation and net lending. Similarly, it frees the investment from the saving decision, as the person can bridge the gap between saving and investment through lending and borrowing. In the specific case graphed in figure 15.11, we find that the chosen consumption  $C_1^0$  is less than the initial endowment  $Y_1$ , so the person saves an amount shown in the figure. But that amount is not sufficient to finance an optimal investment equal to the distance between  $Y_{1}$  and  $I_{A}$  of the chosen production. Hence the difference  $(C_1^0 - I_A)$  is made up by borrowing, as indicated in the figure.

Figure 15.11 illustrates how a rational person can both save and borrow. Many other combinations can work out by varying the position of the chosen points  $A$  and  $C^0$  relative to each other and to the endowment basket  $B$  as well. For example, if  $A$  falls between  $C^0$  and  $B$ , the person ends up saving more than she needs for her investment, and thus she will save, invest, and lend. However, if  $C^0$  falls to the right of  $B$ , the person will dissave, but she can invest at the same time by borrowing the sum of her investment and dissaving.

Incidentally, it should be apparent by now that we can drop our initial assumption that the investment is financed entirely by borrowing, because, if it were financed by the owner's own saving, the cost to the investor of the funds would still be  $R$  per unit, which is the amount of interest that would have to be forgone to shift funds from making loans in the market to financing the investment (the opportunity cost).

# Market Equilibrium

So far, we have discussed how a person responds in terms of saving, investing, and borrowing to a given market  $R$ . But what determines  $R$  itself? The answer once again is demand and supply; that is, the price must be such as to clear the market. The situation we described needs to clear two markets. The first market for loans  $R$  must be such that gross lending equals gross borrowing, or, equivalently, that net borrowing is zero. The second market is the market for the current commodity. The two sources of demand for it are consumption and investment, and  $R$  must be such that aggregate consumption ( $C$ ) plus aggregate investment ( $I$ ) equals the given endowment ( $Y$ ). Thus,  $C + I = Y$ , or, equivalently,  $I = Y - C = S$ .

Consequently,  $R$  must be such that the demand for investment equals the economy's net saving, denoted by  $S$ . But how can  $R$  clear two markets at the same time? One variable cannot satisfy two equations at the same time, unless one is redundant in the sense that the two provide identical solutions. Indeed, it happens that the two market-clearing conditions here are redundant. To see why, recall that the decisions of each individual must satisfy a "budget constraint"; that is, a person's net lending must equal the excess of her saving over her investment. If we sum up this constraint over the entire market, we get  $L = S - I$ , where  $L$  is net lending.

It is apparent from this equation that if an interest rate clears the commodity market by making  $S = I$ , then that same rate makes  $L = 0$ , or clears the loan market. Thus, we can conclude that the equilibrium  $R$  must equate the supply of saving and the demand for investment, or, equivalently, the demand for and supply of loanable funds. If we want to graph the mechanism determining  $R$ , it will be more enlightening to use the commodity market (i.e., saving equals investment).

Equilibrium in this market is represented graphically in figure 15.12, where the rising curve plots the supply of saving, analogous to  $LL$  in figure 15.4. The investment function is drawn to decline uniformly with  $R$ . The justification for this choice can be found in figure 15.8. We have shown that the investment chosen is at the point where the transformation curve has slope  $R$ . If  $R$  rises to  $R_{1}$ , then the investment must shift to a point where the slope is  $R_{1}$ ; and because  $R_{1}$  is larger than  $R$ , the transformation curve at  $R_{1}$  must be steeper. But because of the convexity of the transformation curve, it can occur only if investment is to the left of the initial level, that is, smaller. The market-clearing interest rate is then at the intersection of the saving and investment functions, where the two are equal.

Market equilibrium.

It is also apparent from figure 15.12 that, as long as the intersection occurs in a region where the saving rises with  $R$ , the market-clearing interest rate will be higher, the higher the investment function is. As can be seen in figure 15.13, a shift of the investment function up and to the right (meaning more demand for investment at any given  $R$ ) will raise the interest rate and result in increased saving and investment. Similarly, an increased propensity to save—a shift of the saving curve up and to the left, as shown in figure 15.14—will reduce the interest rate and result in saving and investment, although by less than the shift, because the lower  $R$  will have a depressing effect on saving.

The basic conclusion is that the interest rate reflects a complex set of forces that controls the demand for investment and the supply of saving. These forces are discussed extensively elsewhere, and we do not examine them here except for setting out a representative catalog of relevant factors: the rate of growth of population and productivity; fiscal policy, including incentives to save and invest; demographic variables; the role of bequests; the nature of technological progress; and the openness of international capital markets.

# The Loanable Funds Theory of Interest Rates

Fisher's theory is a general one and obviously neglects certain practical matters, such as the power of the government (in concert with depository institutions) to create money and the government's often large demand for borrowed funds, which is frequently immune to the level of the interest rate. Also, Fisher's theory does not consider the possibility that individuals and firms might invest in cash balances. Expanding Fisher's theory to encompass these situations produces the loanable funds theory of interest rates.

This theory proposes that the general level of interest rates is determined by the complex interaction of two forces. The first is the total demand for funds by firms, governments, and households (or individuals), which carry out a variety of economic activities with those funds. This demand is negatively related to the interest rate (except for the government's demand, which frequently may not depend on the level of the interest rate). If income and other variables do not change, then an increase in the interest rate will reduce the demand for borrowing on the part of many firms and individuals, as projects become less profitable, and consumption and holding cash grow more costly. The second force affecting the level of the interest rate is the total supply of funds by firms, governments, banks, and individuals. Supply is positively related to the level of interest rates, if all other economic factors remain the same.

With rising rates, firms and individuals save and lend more, and banks are more eager to extend more loans. (A rising interest rate probably does not significantly affect the government's supply of savings.) In an equilibrium, the intersection of the supply and demand functions sets the interest rate level and the level of loans. In equilibrium, the demand for funds equals the supply of funds. In this case, all agents are borrowing what they want, investing to the desired extent, and holding all the money they wish to hold. In other words, equilibrium extends through the money market, the bond market, and the market for investment assets.

As in Fisher's theory of interest rates, shifts in the demand and supply curves may occur for many reasons: changes in the money supply, government deficits, changed preferences by individuals, new investment opportunities, and so on. These shifts affect the equilibrium level of the interest rate and of investment in predictable ways. Finally, the expectation of inflation can affect the equilibrium rate through the supply of funds curve, as savers demand higher rates (because of inflation) for any level of savings. Note that this analysis has excluded the question of default on loans: the rate discussed is the risk-free rate, either in its nominal rate or real rate (nominal and real rates are discussed below).

# The Liquidity Preference Theory of Interest Rates

The liquidity preference theory, originally developed by John Maynard Keynes,[4] analyzes the equilibrium level of the interest rate through the interaction of the supply of money and the public's aggregate demand for holding money. Keynes assumed that most people hold wealth in only two forms: "money" and "bonds." For Keynes, "money" is equivalent to currency and demand deposits, which pay little or no interest but are liquid and can be used for immediate transactions. Bonds represent a broad Keynesian category and include long-term, interest-paying financial assets that are not liquid and that pose some risk, because their prices vary inversely with the interest rate level. Bonds may be liabilities of governments or firms. (Default risk is not considered here, and the rate is the risk-free rate, in real or nominal form.)

The public (consisting of individuals and firms) holds money for several reasons: ease of transactions, precaution against unexpected events, and speculation about possible rises in the interest rate. Although money pays no interest, the demand for money is a negative function of the interest rate. At a low rate, people hold a lot of money, because they do not lose much interest by doing so and because the risk of a rise in rates (and a fall in the value of bonds) may be large. With a high interest rate, people desire to hold bonds rather than money, because the cost of liquidity is substantial in terms of lost interest payments and because a decline in the interest rate would lead to gains in the bonds' values. The negative linkage between the interest rate and the demand for money appears as curve  $D$  in figure 15.15, which relates the interest rate to the amount of money in the economy, given the level of income and expected price inflation.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/23669622-4e61-4759-9866-61562641cd84/8482bae628f803633d5f7066dd5a59c19f01bb7dfeeafcec40bad1f7e11b1b3d.jpg)

Figure 15.15 Equilibrium in Keynes's market for money.

For Keynes, the supply of money is fully under the control of the central bank (the Fed in the United States). Moreover, the money supply is not affected by the level of the interest rate. Thus, the supply of money appears, in figure 15.15, as the vertical line,  $MS$ , and the line above the  $MS$  indicates a quantity that does not vary with the interest rate. Of course, equilibrium in the money market requires that the total demand for money equals total supply. In figure 15.15, equilibrium implies an interest rate of  $i$ . Furthermore, equilibrium in the money market implies the equilibrium of the bond market.

The equilibrium rate of interest can change if there is a change in any variable affecting the demand or supply curves. On the demand side, Keynes recognized the importance of two such variables: the level of income and the level of prices for goods and services. A rise in income (with no other variable changing) raises the value of money's liquidity and shifts the demand curve to the right, increasing the equilibrium interest rate. Because people want to hold amounts of "real money" (or monetary units of specific purchasing power), a change in expected inflation would also shift the demand curve to the right and raise the level of interest.

The money supply curve can shift, in Keynes's view, only by actions of the central bank. The central bank's power over interest rates arises because of its ability to buy and sell securities (open market operations), which can alter the amount of money available in the economy. Generally, Keynes thought that an increase in the money supply would, by shifting the supply curve to the right, bring about a decline in the equilibrium interest rate. Similarly, he reasoned that a reduction in the money supply would raise rates. However, there is now widespread recognition that the question of linkage between the money supply and the level of the interest rate is rather more complex than that.

In a comprehensive analysis of this theory, it can be shown that the impact of a change in the money supply can affect the level of interest rates through a liquidity effect, an income effect, and a price expectations effect. Their impact on interest rates will depend on relative magnitudes, based on the level of economic activity at the time of the change in the money supply.

# Böhm-Bawerk's Positive Theory of Capital

Forty years before Irving Fisher formulated his theory of interest rates as described in this chapter, the Austrian economist Eugen Böhm von Bawerk set forth his theory of interest rates and why interest rates must be positive. It would seem to make sense that his theory should be presented first. However, in the almost 500 pages of his book *Positive Theory of Capital*, only two figures appear, and both have limited value in understanding his theory. This is the reason that Robert Shiller, when describing the Böhm-Bawerk's theory, wrote: "This was not Mathematical Economics. It was Literary Economics." And when contrasting the theory by Böhm-Bawerk and Fisher, Paul Samuelson wrote that Böhm-Bawerk "was not quite able to formulate his intuitive vision in terms that would satisfy today's persnickety jury of theorists.[6]

We will now describe Böhm-Bawerk's theory of the determinants of interest rates and why they must be positive.7 The theory set forth by Böhm-Bawerk, as with the theory by Fisher, emphasizes the importance of time as the primary factor affecting interest rates. Böhm-Bawerk offered three reasons. His first two reasons have to do with what economists refer to as positive time preference. The first reason Böhm-Bawerk offers is that over time, an individual's marginal utility declines because an individual expects higher income in the future. Appealing to psychology, his second reason is that the marginal utility of a product/good declines over time. Taken together, positive time preference—according to Böhm-Bawerk—results in individuals who want to borrow to pay a positive interest rate and for those who are willing to lend to require compensation in the form of a positive interest rate. This idea of positive time preference is consistent with the theoretical framework of Fisher.

In addition to time preference, like Fisher, Böhm-Bawerk recognized the importance of technology and argued that technology is the third reason for positive interest rates. His explanation of technology, which may be a little more difficult to understand, is what he refers to as the "roundabout" nature of production or what he simply refers to as "roundaboutness," which involves a time-consuming production process.

To understand what Böhm-Bawerk meant by "roundaboutness," we can use the concept of "goods of higher order," a term originated by Carl Menger, another Austrian economist. He begins with "goods of lowest order," which are goods that can be directly consumed. Crops produced by a farmer would be an example of goods of lower order. Then there are the tools that are used in production, and those tools would be of higher order than goods that can be directly consumed. So, a hoe and tractor would be examples of such goods. Going up an order higher, we have capital goods, which are used to produce tools. The manufacturing of steel that is needed to produce a hoe or a tractor and the manufacturing of rubber for the tires of a tractor would be an example of capital goods. The further those goods that are of higher order are from the production of the goods of lowest order, the more time is needed.

Now let's return to Böhm-Bawerk's theory. The production process begins with the production of capital goods, and then once those capital goods are produced, they are used to help produce goods of lower order desired by the economy. As a result, for the same amount of input, a roundabout production process will generate a greater amount of output. In other words, productivity can be increased if some production is allocated to create goods of higher order that can be used to more efficiently create goods of lower order.

Böhm-Bawerk illustrates roundaboutness with an example of a person who is seeking to obtain water from a spring. The simplest way to obtain the water is to go to the spring each time water is desired. A more efficient production process, however, would be to either use a pail to carry water from the spring to that person's home or use a pipe to draw water from the spring to the person's home. The manufacturing of a pail or the creation of a conduit system to get water from the spring to the person's home are examples of roundaboutness. The creation of the pail and the pipe involves the creation of capital goods, but such creation takes times time. One could think of other examples, such as the production of steel or wood products that a farmer can use to create tools to make farming more efficient.

The implication of roundaboutness is that it not only increases capital goods but also affects interest rates. If capital goods generate higher levels of output for a given level of inputs, there must be a reward for doing so. This increase in output takes the form of a rate of return, which is referred to as "net productivity," and it can be measured terms of a percentage per year. It is a "net" measure, because it is net of the costs of producing capital goods. Producers of capital goods will create them only if doing so is expected to result in a positive net productivity (and therefore will lead to a positive interest rate) and will do so even if the two positive-time preference theories do not hold.

The equilibrium achieved with the intermediation of the loan markets contributes an important property from the point of view of the efficiency of the economy in producing and allocating resources. Economists refer to this property as Pareto optimality. Instinctively we think of economic efficiency as implying the absence, or minimization, of waste. Pareto optimality makes that notion precise and conceptually operational: An allocation is Pareto optimal if it is not possible to reallocate the goods (inputs and outputs) in such a way that some will be better off while nobody will lose.

Clearly, if an allocation is not Pareto optimal, some slack or waste is present; conversely, if slack is present, the allocation cannot be Pareto optimal. In our simplified economy, Pareto optimality is ensured by profit maximization plus the fact that, at market equilibrium, both the marginal productivity of capital and the marginal rate of time preference equals  $R$  for every firm and for every consumer. Thus, it is impossible to increase output by reshuffling inputs among firms; the additional output by those who would gain inputs is offset precisely by the output lost by those losing inputs. By similar reasoning, we can infer that no welfare gain can come from reshuffling the given output among consumers.

Although this result is logically important, it turns out we cannot make too much of it with respect to existing free market economies. First, the result presupposes a perfectly competitive market, which free competition may fail to ensure because of restrictive practices. Second, it ignores transaction costs, information costs, and the consequences of incomplete information. Third, it presents an issue of externalities or effects—negative or positive—that production may have on people other than the buyer of the product. Finally, society may value things other than efficiency, such as the distribution of welfare. Therefore, some non-Pareto optimal solution may trade efficiency for some other property. All these considerations are incentives to make markets more perfect and allow valuing externalities through the price mechanism.

# Real and Nominal Interest Rates: Fisher's Law

The interest rate we have used in our discussion so far is the real rate, which would prevail in the absence of inflation. This rate measures the amount of the commodity next period that can be exchanged for one unit of the commodity now. It generally differs from the nominal rate, which measures the amount of money to be repaid next period per unit borrowed now. The two rates are connected by a simple relation known as Fisher's law. It rests on the principle that an exchange of money now for money later must imply the same rate of exchange between the commodity now and the commodity later, as implied by the real rate.

Suppose the real rate is  $1 + r$ . Then by delivering one unit of the commodity now, we can obtain  $(1 + r)$  units next period. Alternatively, we could sell the commodity now at the spot price,  $p_1$ , and invest the proceeds in a loan at the nominal rate  $(1 + i)$ , obtaining  $p_1(1 + i)$  units of money next period.

How many units of the next-period commodity does that equation represent? To find the answer, we must divide by the second-period price of the commodity,  $p_2$ . Thus, the second-period quantity is  $p_1(1 + i) / (p_2)$ . This quantity must equal the real rate  $(1 + r)$ :

$$
(1 + r) = \frac {1 + i}{1 + p ^ {*}}, \tag {15.1}
$$ where the denominator of equation (15.1) is from


$$

\frac {p _ {1}}{p _ {2}} = \frac {1}{p _ {2} / p _ {1}} = \frac {1}{1 + \left[ \left(p _ {2} - p _ {1}\right) / p _ {1} \right]},

$$ and  $(p_{2} - p_{1}) / p_{1} = p^{*} =$  the percentage rise in the price level over the period of the loan.

Equation (15.1) can be restated in the form

$$
(1 + i) = (1 + r) (1 + p ^ {*}).
$$

Therefore, the nominal gross rate is the product of the gross real rate and 1 plus the rate of inflation. The equation, in turn, implies that

$$ i = r + p ^ {*} + r p ^ {*}.
$$

For the most common values of  $r$  and  $p$ , the product of  $r$  and  $p$  is small enough to be neglected, and the equation can be written as

$$ i \approx r + p ^ {*},
$$ or


$$ r \approx i - p ^ {*}. \tag {15.2}
$$

Equation (15.2) is the formula commonly used to compute the ex post real rate of interest, which cannot be observed directly in the market. It is equally common to measure the anticipated or ex ante real rate of interest by replacing  $p$  by anticipated inflation. The ex ante rate differs from the ex post rate because of errors of expectation. It should be clear that the real rate so computed is not necessarily the same as the rate that would clear markets in the economy without inflation, because market imperfections (including taxation and possibly inflation illusion) can alter the real rate. For instance, in the early phase of unanticipated inflation, the real rate typically falls. In other words, besides reflecting fundamental forces (such as saving and productivity), the real rate may also be affected by other forces (such as inflation), especially in the short run.

# Estimating the Market's Expected Inflation Rate

Economists often make forecasts of the future rate of inflation over some period of time. Prior to 1997, these forecasts were often used by market professionals to estimate what interest rate adjustment should be made to compensate for inflation when considering the purchase of a bond or making a loan. Since 1997, however, it is far more common for market professionals to use the yield on certain U.S. government securities to obtain an estimate of the market's consensus of the expected rate of inflation.

The U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are used for this purpose. These securities are a specific type of inflation-adjusted securities or inflation-linked bonds that are issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. They are described in more detail in chapter 20. For our purpose here, the details about the mechanics of TIPS are unimportant. Basically, TIPS are issued via an auction process, in which their yield is determined. The investor in a TIPS receives the yield, which is determined through the bidding process plus an adjustment for the rate of inflation lagged by two months. The rate of inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The yield that the investor bids for is the real interest rate, which (as explained earlier) is the difference between the nominal yield and the expected rate of inflation. So, if an investor bids  $0.50\%$ , then the investor receives  $0.50\%$  plus the rate of inflation measured by the CPI with a two-month lag.

To estimate the expected inflation rate, an investor compares the yield on a TIPS with that of the yield on a traditional Treasury security with the same maturity. That yield is a nominal interest rate. Because we know from Fisher's law that the nominal yield minus the expected rate of inflation is the real yield, we can back out the expected rate of inflation. This is done by subtracting the real yield for the TIPS of the same maturity from the nominal yield of a Treasury security with a given maturity. On August 29, 2017, the yield quote on a traditional 10-year Treasury note was  $2.17\%$ , and the yield quote for a 10-year TIPS was  $0.42\%$ . Thus, the expected annual inflation rate over the next 10 years would be  $1.75\%$  (i.e.,  $2.17\% - 0.42\%$ ).

# Natural Rate of Interest

The natural rate of interest (also called the "neutral rate of interest") is the real short-term interest rate that would prevail if there were no transitory financial disturbances. That is, it is interest rate that would prevail for stable economic output and a constant inflation rate. The natural interest rate provides a benchmark for the conduct of monetary policy. Monetary policy would be judged to be expansionary if the short-term real rate were below the natural rate, and contractionary in the opposite case. The natural rate of interest is used in policy discussions and decisions.

Closely related to the natural interest rate is the natural rate of unemployment. The unemployment rate is also of paramount importance to policymakers, such as the Fed. The "natural rate of employment"—technically, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)—is the rate of unemployment arising from all sources except fluctuations in aggregate demand. Even in good times, a healthy, dynamic economy will have at least some unemployment as workers switch jobs (called "frictional unemployment") and as new workers enter the labor force and other workers leave it. The Fed makes monetary policy decisions to foster the lowest level of unemployment consistent with stable prices. In June 2017, the Federal

Open Market Committee (FOMC) estimated that the long-run normal rate of unemployment was between  $4.5\%$  and  $5.0\%$ .

There have been four major findings on the natural rate of interest covering four advanced economies (the United States, Canada, the Eurozone, and the United Kingdom). The findings are consistent across the four economies studied. The first major finding is evidence of time variation in the natural rate of interest. The second finding is a downward trend in the natural rate of interest, with the natural rates of all four economies being at historically low levels. The third finding is a substantial co-movement in the natural rate of interest across the four economies. Finally, the estimates of the natural rates of interest are very imprecise.

# Risk-Free Interest Rate and the Existence of a Safe Asset

The risk-free interest rate is the theoretical interest rate an investor would require from a risk-free investment over a specified time. Here "risk free" means that all the risks described in chapter 10 do not exist in an investment that is classified as riskless.

For example, a three-month Treasury bill has often been referred to as a "risk-free investment" and therefore as a safe security for investors who want to avoid any risk, assuming that investors hold it for three months. However, it would have price risk if it were held for either one month or six months. If the investment was for a one-month holding period, the three-month Treasury bill would have to be sold before maturity at an initial unknown price, thus exposing the investor to price risk. With a six-month holding period, at the end of three-months, the investor would have to invest in a new three-month investment at an initially unknown yield. In either case, the investor is faced with an unknown risk over a three-month holding period. Thus, many investors would consider a three-month U.S. Treasury bill to be risk-free rate for U.S. investors who plan to hold it over a three-month holding period. However, two implicit assumptions are made when classifying a three-month Treasury bill as a risk-free security. First, it is assumed that the U.S. government will not default on its obligations (i.e., no credit risk). Second, it is assumed that inflation is insignificant (i.e., no inflation risk). Moreover, for an investor whose home currency is not the

U.S. dollar, an investment in a three-month Treasury bill would expose the investor to foreign-exchange rate risk.

There is an ongoing controversy—the safe asset controversy—that in real-world financial markets there is a shortage or absence of a risk-free asset offering a meaningful positive riskless rate. There are several definitions of what a safe asset is. Gary Gorton defines a safe asset as "an asset that is (almost always) valued at face value without expensive and prolonged analysis."[11] Safe assets play several critical roles in a financial market. First, safe assets are used by certain financial entities to satisfy regulatory requirements. Second, they are used as a pricing benchmark. Third, they are used as collateral in financial transactions. Finally, the development of asset pricing theory and derivatives pricing relies on the existence of a safe or riskless asset. However, as Peter Fisher, former undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury, states in an article about the meaning of the riskless rate: "The idea of risk-free sovereign bonds is best thought of as an oxymoron or as an anomaly of recent history. It is not a useful, necessary or an enduring feature of the financial landscape."[12]

Several studies have focused on the challenges for monetary policy and global financial stability when there is a shortage of a safe asset.[13] Other studies have investigated how asset pricing (discussed in chapter 14) would be impacted when either there is no meaningful riskless asset offering a positive interest rate or if for some reason market participants (such as investors and traders) elect not to invest in a riskless asset. One of the earlier investigations of the role of a riskless asset in financial theory is by Fischer Black, who confirmed that the CAPM holds even in the absence of a risk-free asset (referred to as "Black's zero-beta CAPM").[14]

# Negative Interest Rates

In recent years, some countries have realized nominal negative interest rates for some periods. The economic reason for the realization of negative nominal interest rates is as follows. When weak economies cause deflation (a decline in price levels), investors tend to conserve spending and save, instead of spending and investing. They plan to spend in the future when prices are lower due to inflation. This leads to a further decrease in aggregate demand, leading to further deflation. An expansionary monetary policy—that is, lower interest rates—is often used to combat what economists refer to as "stagnation." Monetary easing by the Fed (in the case of the United States) is accomplished by the Fed buying outstanding debt securities to reduce Treasury yields, which is the standard way of dealing with deflation. According to this method, the Fed funds rate is the interest rate target. This method is called qualitative easing. However, if deflationary pressure is sufficiently weak, even reducing the Fed's interest rate to zero may not provide sufficient stimulus to the economy. A negative interest rate may therefore be necessary. When the Fed employs this method, it is referred to as a negative interest rate policy.

With a negative interest rate, the Fed and, subsequently, individual commercial banks charge negative rates to their lenders. That is, depositors in banks, instead of receiving money on deposits, pay to keep their money in the bank. This provides an incentive for depositors to spend the money rather than pay interest for keeping it as deposits. For example, according to a negative interest rate policy, if the negative interest rate were  $-0.2\%$ , bank depositors would have to pay  $0.2\%$  on their deposits instead of receiving a positive interest rate.

When the financial crisis of 2008-2009 struck, the central bank of the United Kingdom (the Bank of England) and other large central banks cut their overnight rate for bank borrowing to almost zero. When their economies still did not recover, they began to experiment with other tools. One of these tools was quantitative easing, to be explained shortly. A negative interest rate policy has also been used by several other countries. The European Central Bank (ECB) introduced negative rates in 2014 on behalf of its member countries, to prevent the Eurozone from falling into a deflationary spiral. Non-Eurozone countries, such as Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland, have also used negative rates for different purposes.

After 2008, the Fed found that even very low or negative interest rates were insufficient to stimulate the economy, so rather than decreasing interest rates to manage monetary policy, the Fed began to increase its balance sheet holdings by buying outstanding long-term bonds. This type of easing was called "quantitative" easing (QE). According to QE, the focus is on the size of the Fed's balance sheet that results from the Fed purchasing U.S. government and other securities, rather than Fed-influenced interest rates, which is the focus of qualitative easing monetary policy. QE in the U.S. began on November 25, 2008, when the Fed announced that it would purchase up to 600 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and agency debt. The Fed initiated a second round of quantitative easing, QE2, in the fourth quarter of 2010, and subsequently conducted several other rounds of QE. The Bank of Japan and the ECB also eased in this way.

In addition, in 2007, the U.S. economy was further weakened by federal government budgetary problems, which involved cutbacks. Specifically, no stimulative fiscal policy was in place, further weakening the economy. By September 2017, the economy had strengthened, and the Fed began unwinding the QE plan implemented in 2008 by then-Fed chairman Bernanke to stimulate the weak economy. During this QE period, the Fed had more than quadrupled the size of its balance sheet to 4.5 trillion. This plan for unwinding was a sign of confidence in the economic recovery.

# Historical Interest Rates in the United States

Thus far we have described two types of what is referred to as "interest rates": nominal interest rates and real interest rates. Here we take a brief look at historical nominal and real interest rates in the United States based on yields on U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Treasury bills are short-term instruments issued by the U.S. government with a maturity of no more than one year. U.S. Treasury notes and bonds have a maturity in excess of one year. Treasury notes have a maturity of up to 10 years, and bonds have a maturity greater than 10 years. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are guaranteed by the U.S. government.

From 1870 until 1978, the yields on U.S. Treasury securities varied between  $2\%$  and  $7\%$  most of the time. Therefore, the historical yields on U.S. Treasury securities were quite simple during this 109-year period. But from 1970 to 1979, the economy experienced stagnation, which is a combination of slow economic growth and accelerating inflation. This stagnation was induced by the 1973 oil crises and the 1979 energy crisis. The resulting inflation was of significant concern to federal government policymakers, including the Fed and then-president Jimmy Carter. This concern was the basis for what was referred to as the "Volcker tightening." Paul Volcker became the Fed chairman during August 1979 and remained until August 1987. Volcker instituted a series of Fed tightenings of the Fed funds rate beginning in 1979 to eliminate inflation. Under Volcker, the Fed funds rate reached highs of  $20\%$  during 1979 and 1980. This series of tightenings also caused two recessions in 1980 (six months) and 1981–1982 (16 months). In addition, during 1981, the 30-year Treasury bond yield increased to more than  $14\%$ .

Although that was the bad news at the time, the good news resulting from these tightenings and recessions was that they unleashed a period of economic growth, reduction in the inflation rate, and a decline in bond yields. They also induced a stock market rally, which continued into mid-2018 (but also included two major equity bear markets in 2000–2002 and 2007–2009, discussed below). Ten-year Treasury yields declined to approximately  $1.50\%$  in 2015 and remained slightly over  $2\%$  in 2017.

Returning to the Fed tightening period during 1979-1981, prior to this period, during 1979, inflation was  $13.31\%$ , and long-term corporate bonds returned  $-4.18\%$ . After the Fed tightening began, the Fed funds rate exceeded  $19\%$ , the one-year Treasury bill yield exceeded  $10\%$ , the 10-year Treasury note yield exceeded  $15\%$ , and the inflation rate was more than  $11\%$  (in early 1980).

The economy recovered quickly from the two recessions. Inflation, which had annual rates of  $13.3\%$  and  $12.4\%$  in 1979 and 1980, respectively (it peaked at  $14.8\%$  in March 1980), declined to  $8.9\%$  in 1981 and  $3.9\%$  in 1982. After real GDP growth rates of  $-0.04\%$ ,  $1.29\%$ , and  $-1.40\%$  in 1980, 1981, and 1982, respectively, real GDP growth grew by  $7.83\%$  (1983),  $5.63\%$  (1984), and  $4.28\%$  in 1983 (1985). The rest of the 1980s and the beginning of the first half of the 1990s exhibited moderate growth—with the exception of 1991, which experienced a short (8-month), mild  $(-0.17\%)$  real GDP growth) recession due to a real-estate based recession.

Then from 1995 to 1999, one of the strongest stock market periods in U.S. history occurred. This was a large-cap growth, technology sector-led rally and ended in what was called the tech "bubble." The years 2003-2006 constituted a period of economic and financial moderation—in fact, it was called the "Great Moderation" due to its low macroeconomic volatility.

In 2007-2008, another speculative period—this time due mainly to subprime mortgages—called the Great Recession (as opposed to the Great Depression in 1929) followed. This was the most severe recession since the Great Depression. The Great Recession has had a continuing effect on the bond market. In 2008, yields on U.S. Treasury bills fell from slightly over  $3.0\%$  at the beginning of the year to almost zero by the end of the year. In the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, investors' behavior could be described as an extreme flight to safety—investors were willing to accept little (if anything) risk in return for the assurance that they would get their principal back. In other words, the return of capital took precedence over the return on capital.[16] From 2009 to 2017, 10-year Treasury note yields remained near historical lows at  $2.3\%$ . From 2009 to 2015, the yield on 90-day Treasury bills did not exceed  $0.12\%$ .

These movements have led to a current conundrum in the bond market as of year-end 2017. Many bond market observers ask when bond yields will return to their "normal" higher yields of  $5\%$  and more, using the period of 1970-2000 as the basis for what is normal in the bond market. In contrast, many bond market observers look at the period after 1970-2000 and conclude that 10-year Treasury bond yields are currently normal at slightly more than  $2\%$ , where they have been for more than a decade. The proponents of the post-2000 low yield as being normal argue that the 1970-2000 period was an anomalous period and therefore does not represent what market participants should expect for future interest rates.

# Key Points
- Interest is the price paid for the temporary use of resources, and the amount of a loan is its principal.
- Irving Fisher's theory of interest analyzes the equilibrium level of the interest rate as the result of the interaction of savers' willingness to save and borrowers' demand for investment funds.
- In Fisher's terms, the interest rate reflects the interaction of savers' marginal rate of time preference and borrowers' marginal productivity of capital.
- The loanable funds theory is an extension of Fisher's theory and proposes that the equilibrium rate of interest reflects the demand and supply of funds, which depend on savers' willingness to save, borrowers' expectations regarding the profitability of investing, and the government's action regarding money supply.
- The liquidity preference theory is Keynes's view that the rate of interest is set in the market for money balances.
- In the liquidity preference theory, the demand for money reflects the liquidity of money by comparison with long-term financial instruments; demand depends on the interest rate, income, and the price level.
- In the liquidity preference theory, changes in the money supply can affect the level of interest rates through the liquidity effect, the income effect, and the price expectations effect; their relative magnitudes depend on the level of economic activity at the time of the change in the money supply.
- Eugen Böhm von Bawerk set forth his theory of interest rates and why interest rates must be positive: positive time preference, declining marginal utility of a product/service over time, and technology (roundaboutness).
- Fisher's law states that the observable nominal rate of interest is composed of two unobservable variables: the real rate of interest and the premium for expected inflation.
- The real rate of interest is the interest rate that would prevail in the absence of inflation.
- It can be shown that the nominal rate of interest is approximately equal to the real rate of interest plus anticipated inflation, a relationship referred to as "Fisher's law."
- The yield offered on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) is the market's real rate.
- The expected annual rate of inflation can be estimated from the yield on TIPS and the yield on traditional Treasury securities of the same maturity.
- The natural rate of interest (or neutral rate of interest) is the real short-term interest rate that would prevail if there were no transitory financial disturbances.
- Safe assets play four critical roles in a financial market: (1) they are used by certain financial entities to satisfy regulatory requirements; (2) they are used as a pricing benchmark; (3) they are used as collateral in financial transactions; and (4) the development of asset pricing theory and derivatives pricing relies on the existence of a safe or riskless asset.
- Negative interest rates can exist in an economy, and central bank policies can produce that outcome.

17. Actually, Böhm-Bawerk's writings on the theory of interest rates appear in two books. His 1884 book, *Geschichte und Kritik der Kapitalzins-Theorieen*, translated by William Smart as *Capital and Interest* (North Charleston, SC: Createspace, 1989) described the various practical and theoretical opinions about interest rates. The book laid the foundation for his book (translated by William Smart in 1989), *The Positive Theory of Capital* (North Charleston, SC: Createspace, 1989). The 1989 translated book is available at https://mises.org/system/tdf/The\%20Positive\%20Theory\%20of\%20Capital.pdf?file=1&type=document.
