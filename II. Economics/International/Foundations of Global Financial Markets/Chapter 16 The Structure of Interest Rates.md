In chapter 15, we explained interest rate determination in a simple economy. However, no economy has just one interest rate; instead, there is a structure of interest rates. The interest rate that a borrower must pay depends on a myriad of factors, which we describe in this chapter. We begin with a discussion of the structure of interest rates, explaining the factors that affect the yield spread or risk premium for non-U.S. Treasury securities (i.e., why debt obligations not issued by the U.S. Treasury offer a higher potential yield than U.S. Treasury securities offer). We then focus on one particular relationship: the relationship between the yield offered on a debt obligation and its maturity. This relationship is referred to as the "term structure of interest rates."

# The Structure of Interest Rates

The numerous debt obligations issued by public and private entities throughout the world offer different interest rates. When an entity agrees to pay an interest rate on a debt obligation that it has issued, the interest rate is not randomly determined. Instead, certain factors affect the interest rates that determine what interest rate an entity will have to pay if it wants to borrow money. We refer to these factors that determine the interest rate that borrowers must pay as the "structure of interest rates." The starting point in determining the interest rate that a borrower must pay is the base interest rate.

# The Base Interest Rate

The securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, popularly referred as to Treasury securities, or simply Treasuries, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Consequently, market participants throughout the world view them as having no credit risk. As a result, historically the interest rates on Treasury securities served as the benchmark interest rates throughout the U.S. economy, as well as in international capital markets. Other important benchmarks have developed in the international capital markets, and we will discuss one of these.

Treasury securities are used to develop benchmark interest rates. The two categories of U.S. Treasury securities are discount securities and coupon securities. The fundamental difference between the two types results from the form of the stream of payments that the holder receives, which in turn reflects the prices at which the securities are issued. Coupon securities pay interest every six months, plus principal at maturity. Discount securities pay only a contractually fixed amount at maturity. Treasury securities are typically issued on an auction basis according to regular cycles for securities of specific maturities. The current Treasury practice is to issue all securities with maturities of one year or less as discount securities, called Treasury bills. All securities with maturities of two years or longer are issued as Treasury coupon securities.

The most recently auctioned Treasury issues for each maturity are referred to as on-the-run issues or current coupon issues. Issues auctioned prior to the current coupon issues are typically referred to as off-the-run issues; they are not as liquid as on-the-run issues and therefore offer a higher yield than the corresponding on-the-run Treasury issue. Note that every day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury estimates the yield for Treasury securities based on the yield for on-the-run and off-the-run issues.

The minimum interest rate or base interest rate that investors demand for investing in a non-Treasury security is the yield offered on a comparable maturity for an on-the-run Treasury security. So, for example, if an investor wanted to purchase a 10-year bond on a particular day at the time that the 10-year on-the-run Treasury is  $4.49\%$ , then the minimum yield the investor would want is  $4.49\%$ . The base interest rate is also referred to as the benchmark interest rate.

# The Risk Premium

Market participants talk of interest rates on non-Treasury securities as "trading at a spread" to a particular on-the-run Treasury security (or at a spread to any particular benchmark interest rate selected). For example, if the yield on a 10-year non-Treasury security is  $5.89\%$  when the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield is  $4.49\%$ , then the spread would be 140 basis points. This spread reflects the additional risks the investor faces by acquiring this security that is not issued by the U.S. government, and therefore the spread can be called a risk premium. Thus, we can express the interest rate offered on a non-Treasury security as

Base interest rate + Spread, or equivalently,

Base interest rate + Risk premium.

We have already discussed the factors that affect the base interest rate in chapter 15. One of the factors is the expected rate of inflation. That is, the base interest rate can be expressed as

Base interest rate  $=$  Real rate of interest + Expected rate of inflation.

How can the real rate of inflation required by market participants be estimated? The U.S. Department of the Treasury issues securities indexed to the CPI. These securities are called Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), and we discuss them in chapter 20.

There are factors that affect the interest rate by which a security offers above an otherwise comparable benchmark security. This additional interest rate is referred to as the yield spread or simply spread. The factors that drive the yield spread include

1. the type of issuer,
2. the issuer's perceived creditworthiness,
3. the term or maturity of the instrument,
4. provisions that grant either the issuer or the investor the option to do something,
5. the taxability of the interest received by investors, and
6. the expected liquidity of the issue.

Typically, the benchmark interest rate used is a U.S. Treasury security. However, it is important to emphasize that yield spreads must be interpreted relative to the benchmark interest rate used, particularly in relation to the second and last factors, which affect the spread when the benchmark interest rate is other than the yield on U.S. Treasury securities.

Types of issuers A key feature of a debt obligation is the nature of the issuer. The bond market is classified by the type of issuer, and groups of securities of the various kinds of issuers are referred to as market sectors. The spread between the interest rates offered in two sectors of the bond market on obligations with the same maturity is referred to as an intermarket sector spread.

Excluding the Treasury market sector, the other market sectors include a wide range of issuers, each with different abilities to satisfy their contractual obligations. For example, in the corporate market sector, issuers are classified as follows: (1) utilities, (2) industrials, (3) finance, and (4) banks. The spread between two issues in a market sector is called an intramarket sector spread.

Perceived creditworthiness of issuer As explained in chapter 10, credit risk encompasses two forms of risk: default risk and credit spread risk. The risk that the issuer of a bond may be unable to make timely principal or interest payments is called "default risk" and is gauged by the issuer's credit rating, as assigned by credit rating agencies (the three major ones being Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's Corporation, and Fitch Ratings).

In all systems, the term high grade means low credit risk, or conversely, a high probability of future payments. The highest-grade bonds are denoted by Moody's by the symbol Aaa, and by S&P and Fitch by the symbol AAA. The next highest grade is denoted by the symbol Aa (Moody's) or AA (S&P and Fitch). For the third grade, all rating systems use A. The next three grades are Baa or BBB, Ba or BB, and B, respectively. There are also C grades. Moody's uses 1, 2, or 3 to provide a narrower credit quality breakdown within each class, and S&P and Fitch use plus and minus signs for the same purpose.

Bonds rated triple A (AAA or Aaa) are said to be prime, double A (AA or Aa) are of high quality, single-A issues are called upper medium grade, and triple-B issues are medium grade. Lower-rated bonds are said to have speculative elements or to be distinctly speculative.

Bond issues assigned a rating in the top four categories are referred to as investment-grade bonds. Issues that carry a rating below the top four categories are referred to as noninvestment-grade bonds, or more popularly as high-yield bonds or junk bonds. Thus the bond market can be divided into two sectors, the investment-grade and noninvestment-grade markets.

Another form of credit risk that we did not describe in chapter 10 (because we did not discuss credit ratings) is the risk that the issuer's credit rating will be lowered. This risk is referred to as downgrade risk.

The spread between Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities that are identical in all respects except for credit quality is referred to as a credit spread. For example, suppose that the yield for corporate bonds with 10 years to maturity on a particular day is  $5.39\%$  for AAA-rated bonds and  $5.66\%$  for AA-rated bonds. Suppose also that the 10-year on-the-run Treasury rate is  $4.49\%$ . Hence, the yield spread for 10-year AAA-rated corporate bonds is 90 basis points  $(5.39\% - 4.49\%)$ , and for AA-rated corporate bonds the yield spread is 117 basis points  $(5.66\% - 4.49\%)$ . In this illustration, we see that the lower the credit quality is, the larger the yield spread will be. This is the typical relationship observed in real-world debt markets.

Term to maturity As explained in chapter 11, the price of a financial asset fluctuates over its life as yields in the market change. As we demonstrated, the volatility of a bond's price depends on its maturity. More specifically, holding all other factors constant, the longer the maturity of a bond is, the greater will be its price volatility resulting from a change in market yields. The spread between any two maturity sectors of the market is called a maturity spread, or yield curve spread. (The graphical relationship between the yield and maturity for a sector of the market is called the "yield curve" and is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.) Although this spread can be calculated for any sector of the market, it is most commonly calculated for the Treasury sector.

In the corporate bond market, a maturity spread can be similarly calculated, but the issues must have the same credit quality. For example, suppose that on a given day the following yields are observed for AA-rated corporate bonds:

2-year AA corporate bonds:  $4.67\%$

5-year AA corporate bonds:  $5.07\%$

10-year AA corporate bonds:  $5.66\%$

The maturity spreads are then:

2-year/5-year maturity spread:  $5.07\% - 4.67\% = 0.40\% = 40$  bps

2-year/10-year maturity spread:  $5.66\% - 4.67\% = 0.99\% = 99$  bps

5-year/10-year maturity spread:  $5.66\% - 5.07\% = 0.59\% = 59$  bps

The relationship between the yields on comparable securities but different maturities is called the term structure of interest rates. The term-to-maturity topic is of such importance that we devote the last section of this chapter to it.

Inclusion of options It is not uncommon for a bond issue to include a provision that gives either the bondholder or the issuer an option to take some action against the other party. An option that is included in a bond issue is referred to as an embedded option.

The most common type of option in a bond issue is a call provision. This provision grants the issuer the right to retire the debt, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The inclusion of a call feature benefits issuers by allowing them to replace an old bond issue with a lower-interest-cost issue should interest rates in the market decline. Effectively, a call provision allows the issuer to alter the maturity of a bond. A call provision is detrimental to the bondholder, because the bondholder will be uncertain about maturity and might have to reinvest the proceeds received at a lower interest rate if the bond is called and the bondholder wants to keep his or her funds in issues with a similar risk of default.

An issue may also include a provision that allows the bondholder to alter the maturity of a bond. An issue with a put provision grants the bondholder the right to sell the issue back to the issuer at par value on designated dates. Here the advantage to the investor is that, if interest rates rise after the issue date and result in a price that is less than the par value, the investor can force the issuer to redeem the bond at par value.

A convertible bond is an issue giving the bondholder the right to exchange the bond for a specified number of shares of common stock. This feature allows the bondholder to take advantage of favorable movements in the price of the issuer's common stock.

The presence of these embedded options affects the spread of an issue relative to a Treasury security and the spread relative to otherwise comparable issues that do not have an embedded option. In general, market participants require a larger spread over a comparable Treasury security for an issue with an embedded option that is favorable to the issuer (e.g., a call option) than for an issue without such an option. In contrast, market participants require a smaller spread over a comparable Treasury security for an issue with an embedded option that is favorable to the investor (e.g., a put option or a conversion option). In fact, for a bond with an option that is favorable to an investor, the interest rate on an issue may be less than that on a comparable Treasury security!

A major part of the bond market is the mortgage market. A wide range of mortgage-backed securities is discussed in chapters 30 and 31. But as explained in chapter 10, these securities expose an investor to a form of call risk known as "prepayment risk." Consequently, a yield spread between a mortgage-backed security and a comparable on-the-run Treasury security reflects this call risk. To see how, let's consider a basic mortgage-backed security called a "Ginnie Mae pass-through security." This security is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Consequently, the yield spread between a Ginnie Mae pass-through security and a comparable Treasury security is not to the result of credit risk. Instead, it is primarily the result of call risk.

Taxability of interest Unless exempted under the federal income tax code, interest income is taxable at the federal level. In addition to federal income taxes, state and local taxes may apply to interest income.

The U.S. federal tax code specifically exempts the interest income from qualified municipal bond issues from taxation at the federal level. Municipal bonds are securities issued by state and local governments and by their creations, such as "authorities" and special districts.

The large majority of outstanding municipal bonds are tax-exempt securities. Because of the tax-exempt feature of municipal bonds, the yield on municipal bonds is less than that on Treasuries with the same maturity. The difference in yield between tax-exempt securities and Treasury securities is typically measured not in basis points but in percentage terms. More specifically, it is measured as the percentage of the yield on a tax-exempt security relative to the yield of a comparable Treasury security.

The yield on a taxable bond issue after federal income taxes are paid is:

After-tax yield  $=$  Pre-tax yield  $\times$  (1 - Marginal tax rate).

For example, suppose a taxable bond issue offers a yield of  $3\%$  and is acquired by an investor facing a marginal tax rate of  $35\%$ . The after-tax yield would then be:

After-tax yield  $= 0.03 \times (1 - 0.35) = 0.0195 = 1.95\%$ .

Alternatively, we can determine the yield that must be offered on a taxable bond issue to give the same after-tax yield as a tax-exempt issue. This yield is called the equivalent-taxable yield and is determined as follows:

Equivalent-taxable yield  $= \frac{\text{Tax-exempt yield}}{(1 - \text{Marginal tax rate})}$ .

For example, consider an investor facing a  $35\%$  marginal tax rate who purchases a tax-exempt issue with a yield of  $1.95\%$ . The equivalent-taxable yield is:

Equivalent-taxable yield  $= \frac{0.0195}{(1 - 0.35)} = 0.03 = 3\%$ .

Note that the lower the marginal tax rate is, the lower the equivalent-taxable yield will be. Thus, in our previous example, if the marginal tax rate were  $25\%$  rather than  $35\%$ , the equivalent-taxable yield would be  $2.6\%$  rather than  $4\%$ , as shown here:

Equivalent-taxable yield  $= \frac{0.0195}{(1 - 0.25)} = 0.026 = 2.6\%$

In the United States, state and local governments may tax interest income on bond issues that are exempt from federal income taxes. Some municipalities exempt interest income paid on all municipal issues from taxation; others do not. Some states exempt interest income from bonds issued by municipalities in the state but tax the interest income from bonds issued by municipalities outside the state. The implication is that two municipal securities of the same quality rating and the same maturity may trade at some spread because of different tax policies and hence the relative demand for bonds of municipalities in different states. For example, in a high-income-tax state, such as the State of New York, the demand for bonds of municipalities drives down their yield relative to the yield of bonds issued by municipalities in low-income-tax states, such as the State of Florida.

In the United States, municipalities are not permitted to tax the interest income from securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. Thus, part of the spread between Treasury securities and taxable non-Treasury securities of the same maturity reflects the value of the exemption from state and local taxes.

Expected liquidity of an issue Bonds trade with different degrees of liquidity. The greater the expected liquidity with which an issue trades, the lower will be the yield that investors require.

As noted earlier, Treasury securities are the most liquid securities in the world. The lower yield offered on Treasury securities relative to the yield on non-Treasury securities reflects, to a significant extent, the difference in liquidity. Even in the Treasury market, however, some differences in liquidity occur, because on-the-run issues have greater liquidity than do off-the-run issues. An important factor that affects the liquidity of an issue is the size of the issue. One of the reasons U.S. Treasury securities are highly liquid is the large size of each individual issue.

An Alternative Benchmark Interest Rate: The Swap Rate

Let us return to the interpretation of the yield spread on a non-U.S. Treasury security that is used as the benchmark interest rate. Because the U.S. Treasury securities are viewed by market participants as having minimal credit risk, the yield spread between a non-U.S. Treasury security and that on a U.S. Treasury security reflects credit risk, as well as liquidity risk and the risk associated with any embedded options. Several alternative benchmarks have been suggested. The attributes of a benchmark interest rate are that (1) the market for the financial instrument should be viewed as having minimal credit risk, and (2) it should be highly liquid.

Of the several alternative benchmarks suggested, the one that has been used most frequently is the interest rate swap rate. We describe an interest rate swap and the swap rate in more detail in chapter 37. Here we briefly explain a generic interest rate swap, which is a derivative instrument.

The parties to an interest rate swap exchange interest rate payments on specified dates: One party pays a fixed rate and the other party a floating rate over the life of the swap. In a typical swap, the floating rate is based on a reference rate, and the reference rate is typically LIBOR. LIBOR is the interest rate at which prime banks in London pay other prime banks on U.S. dollar certificates of deposits.

The fixed interest rate that is paid by the fixed-rate counterparty is called the swap rate. Dealers in the swap market quote swap rates for different maturities. For example, the fixed interest rate may be the 10-year Treasury rate. So a 10-year treasury rate would be " swapped for" the LIBOR. The relationship between the swap rate and the maturity of a swap is called the swap rate yield curve, or more commonly, the swap curve. Because the reference rate is typically LIBOR, the swap curve is also called the LIBOR curve.

There is a swap curve for most countries. For euro interest rate swaps, the reference rate is the euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), which is the rate at which bank deposits in EU countries that have adopted the euro currency are offered by one prime bank to another prime bank.

The swap curve is used as a benchmark in many countries outside the United States. Unlike a country's government bond yield curve, however, the swap curve is not a default-free yield curve. Instead, it reflects the credit risk of the counterparty to an interest rate swap. Because the counterparty to an interest rate swap is typically a bank-related entity, the swap curve reflects the average credit risk of representative banks that provide interest rate swaps. More specifically, a swap curve is viewed as the interbank yield curve. It is also referred to as the AA-rated yield curve, because the banks that borrow money from one another at LIBOR have credit ratings of Aa/AA or above. In addition, the swap curve reflects liquidity risk. However, the liquidity of the interest rate swap market has increased to the point where it is now a more liquid market than the market for some government bonds.

One would expect that if a country has a government bond market, the yields in that market will be the best benchmark. That is not necessarily the case. Using a swap curve has several advantages over using a country's government securities yield curve.[2] First, it may be advantageous for technical reasons: In a government bond market, some of the interest rates may not be representative of the true interest rate but instead be biased by some technical or regulatory factor unique to that market. For example, market participants may need to cover a short position in a particular government bond, and the actions to cover a short position would push up the demand for that particular government bond and drive down its yield. In the swap market, nothing has to be delivered, so technical market factors have less of an impact. Also, there may be government bonds selling above or below their par value. As explained earlier, government tax authorities might tax such bonds differently if they are purchased and held to maturity. As a result, the yields at which these bonds trade in the marketplace will reflect any tax advantage or disadvantage.

Although it may be difficult to appreciate these factors at this point in our study of financial markets, the key is that the observed interest rate on government securities may not reflect the true interest rate because of these factors. This is not the case for swap rates. This market is not regulated, and hence swap rates represent true interest rates. However, swap rates do reflect credit risk and liquidity risk.

Second, to create a representative government bond yield curve, a large number of maturities must be available. However, in most government bond markets, securities with only a few maturities are issued. For example, as will be seen when we discuss U.S. Treasury securities in chapter 20, the U.S. government issues only four securities with a maturity of two years or more (2, 5, 10, and 30 years). Although plenty of off-the-run issues are available from which to construct a government bond yield curve, the yields on such issues may not be true interest rates for the reasons just noted. In contrast, in the swap market, a wide range of maturities is quoted. In fact, in the United States, the issuance of 30-year bonds was suspended for a time, and as a result, 30-year Treasury rates were unavailable. Yet swap dealers quoted 30-year swap rates.

Finally, the ability to compare government yields across countries is difficult because of differences in the credit risk for every country. In contrast, as explained earlier, the swap curve is an interbank yield curve, which facilitates cross-country comparisons of benchmark interest rates.

Now we will look at the relationship between the yield on a bond and its maturity. Because the maturity of a bond is referred to as its term to maturity or simply its term, the relationship between yield and maturity is referred to as the term structure of interest rates. Here we explain the various theories about the determinations of the term structure of interest rates.

The graphic that depicts the relationship between the yield on bonds of the same credit quality but different maturities is known as the yield curve. Market participants tend to construct yield curves from observations of prices and yields in the Treasury market. Two reasons account for this tendency. First, Treasury securities are free of default risk, and differences in creditworthiness do not affect yield estimates. Second, as the largest and most active bond market, the Treasury market offers the fewest problems of illiquidity or infrequent trading.

Figure 16.1 shows the general shape of three hypothetical Treasury yield curves observed from time to time in the United States. Daily yield curve information is available from a variety of sources on a real-time basis. Historical information about daily yield curves from 1990 on can be obtained from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's website.

As we explained in chapter 15, from a practical viewpoint, the Treasury yield curve functions mainly as a benchmark for pricing bonds and setting yields in many other sectors of the debt market—bank loans, mortgages, corporate debt, and international bonds. More recently, market participants have come to realize that the traditionally constructed Treasury yield curve is an unsatisfactory measure of the relationship between required yield and maturity. The key reason is that securities with the same maturity may actually provide different yields. As we will explain, this phenomenon reflects the role and impact of differences in the bonds' coupon rates. Hence, it is necessary to develop more accurate and reliable estimates of the Treasury yield curve. In what follows, we show the problems posed by traditional approaches to the Treasury yield curve and offer an innovative and increasingly popular approach to building a yield curve. The approach consists of identifying yields that apply to zero-coupon bonds and therefore eliminates the problem of nonuniqueness in the yield-maturity relationship.

# Spot Rates

As explained in chapter 11, the price of any financial asset is the present value of its cash flow. However, in our illustrations and discussion to this point in the book, we have assumed that one interest rate should be used to discount all cash flows from a financial asset. In chapter 15, we indicated that the appropriate interest rate is the yield on a Treasury security with the same maturity as the financial asset, plus an appropriate yield premium or spread.

As just noted, however, there is a problem with using the Treasury yield curve to determine the appropriate yield at which to discount the cash flow of a bond. To illustrate this problem, we'll use the following two hypothetical five-year Treasury bonds, A and B. The difference between these two Treasury bonds is the coupon rate, which is  $12\%$  for A and  $3\%$  for B. The cash flow for these two bonds per 100 of par value for the 10 six-month periods to maturity would be:

<table><tr><td>Period</td><td>Cash Flow for A ($)</td><td>Cash Flow for B ($)</td></tr><tr><td>1–9</td><td>6.00</td><td>1.50</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>106.00</td><td>101.50</td></tr></table>

Because of the different cash flow patterns, it is not appropriate to use the same interest rate to discount all cash flows. Instead, each cash flow should be discounted at a unique interest rate that is appropriate for the time period in which the cash flow will be received. But what should the interest rate be for each period?

The correct way to think about bonds A and B is not as bonds but as packages of cash flows. More specifically, they are packages of zero-coupon instruments. A zero-coupon instrument is one that is purchased at an amount below its maturity value and pays no interest periodically. Instead, the interest is earned at the maturity date, when the investor receives the maturity or principal value. Thus, the interest earned is the difference between the maturity value and the price paid. For example, bond A can be viewed as 10 zero-coupon instruments: one with a maturity value of  $6 maturing six months from now, a second with a maturity value of$ 6 maturing one year from now, a third with a maturity value of $6 maturing 1.5 years from now, and so on. The final zero-coupon instrument matures 10 six-month periods from now and has a maturity value of $106.

Likewise, bond B can be viewed as 10 zero-coupon instruments: one with a maturity value of  $1.50 maturing six months from now, one with a maturity value of$ 1.50 maturing one year from now, one with a maturity value of $1.50 maturing 1.5 years from now, and so on. The final zero-coupon instrument matures 10 six-month periods from now and has a maturity value of $101.50. Obviously, in the case of each coupon bond, the value or price of the bond is equal to the total value of its component zero-coupon instruments.

In general, any bond can be viewed as a package of zero-coupon instruments. That is, each zero-coupon instrument in the package has a maturity equal to its coupon payment date or, in the case of the principal, the maturity date. The value of the bond should equal the value of all the component zero-coupon instruments. If this does not hold, it is possible for a market participant to generate riskless profits. Because no one can pass up riskless and certain profits, the market must drive these two prices to equality, and our discussion here assumes that equality.

To determine the value of each zero-coupon instrument, it is necessary to know the yield on a zero-coupon Treasury with that same maturity. This yield is called the spot rate, and the graphical depiction of the relationship between the spot rate and its maturity is called the spot rate curve. As demonstrated next, this curve is derived from theoretical considerations of the yields of the actually traded Treasury securities. Such a curve is called a theoretical spot rate curve.

Constructing the theoretical spot rate curve Let's see how the theoretical spot rate curve is constructed from the yield curve that is based on the observed yields of Treasury bills and Treasury coupon securities.

The process of creating a theoretical spot rate curve in this way is referred to as bootstrapping. To explain this process, we'll use the data for the hypothetical price, annualized yield (yield to maturity), and maturity of the 20 Treasury securities shown in table 16.1.

Throughout the analysis and illustrations to come, it is important to remember that the basic principle underlying bootstrapping is that the value of the Treasury coupon security should be equal to the value of the package of zero-coupon Treasury securities that duplicates the coupon bond's cash flow.

Let's start by considering the six-month Treasury bill in table 16.1. As we explained earlier in this chapter, a Treasury bill is a zero-coupon instrument. Therefore, its annualized yield of  $8\%$  is equal to the spot rate. Similarly, for the one-year Treasury, the cited yield of  $8.3\%$  is the one-year spot rate.[5] Given these two spot rates, we can compute the spot rate for a theoretical 1.5-year zero-coupon Treasury. The price of a theoretical 1.5-year zero-coupon Treasury should equal the present value of the three cash flows from an actual 1.5-year coupon Treasury, where the yield used for discounting is the spot rate corresponding to the cash flow. Using $100 as par, the cash flow for the 1.5-year Treasury with the  $8.5\%$  coupon rate is computed as follows:

0.5 years: 0.085 × $100 × 0.5 = $4.25.
1.0 years:  $0.085 \times \100 \times 0.5 = \$ 4.25 .
 1.5 years: 0.085 × $100 × 0.5 + 100 = $104.25.

The present value of the cash flow is then:

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 2 5}{(1 + z _ {1}) ^ {1}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 2 5}{(1 + z _ {2}) ^ {2}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 0 4 . 2 5}{(1 + z _ {3}) ^ {3}},
$$ where


$z_{1} =$  one-half the annualized six-month theoretical spot rate,
$z_{2} =$  one-half the one-year theoretical spot rate,
$z_{3} =$  one-half the 1.5-year theoretical spot rate.

Because the six-month spot rate and the one-year spot rate are  $8.0\%$  and  $8.3\%$ , respectively, we know these facts:

$$ z _ {1} = 0. 0 4 \text {a n d} z _ {2} = 0. 0 4 1 5.
$$

We can compute the present value of the 1.5-year coupon Treasury security as follows:

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 2 5}{(1 . 0 4 0 0) ^ {1}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 2 5}{(1 . 0 4 1 5) ^ {2}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 0 4 . 2 5}{(1 + z _ {3}) ^ {3}}.
$$

Because the price of the 1.5-year coupon Treasury security (from table 16.1) is 99.45, the following relationship between the market price and the present value of the cash flow must hold:

$$
\$ 99.45 = \frac{\$ 4.25}{(1.0400) ^ {1}} +\frac{\$ 4.25}{(1.0415) ^ {2}} +\frac{\$ 104.25}{(1 + z _ {3}) ^ {3}}.
$$

We can solve for the theoretical 1.5-year spot rate to obtain a value of  $z_{3}$  of 0.04465.

Doubling this yield, we obtain the bond-equivalent yield of 0.0893 or  $8.93\%$ , which is the theoretical 1.5-year spot rate. That rate is the rate that the market would apply to a 1.5-year zero-coupon Treasury security if, in fact, such a security existed.

Given the theoretical 1.5-year spot rate, we can obtain the theoretical two-year spot rate. The cash flow for the two-year coupon Treasury in table 16.1 is

0.5 years: 0.090 × $100 × 0.5 = $4.50.
1.0 year:  $0.090 \times \100 \times 0.5 = \$ 4.50 .
 1.5 years: 0.090 × $100 × 0.5 = $4.50.
2.0 years:  $0.090 \times \100 \times 0.5 + 100 = \$ 104.50 .

The present value of the cash flow is then:

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 5 0}{(1 + z _ {1}) ^ {1}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 5 0}{(1 + z _ {2}) ^ {2}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 5 0}{(1 + z _ {3}) ^ {3}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 0 4 . 5 0}{(1 + z _ {4}) ^ {4}}
$$ where  $z_{4}$  is half of the two-year theoretical spot rate. Because the six-month spot rate, the one-year spot rate, and the 1.5-year spot rate are  $8.0\%$ ,  $8.3\%$ , and  $8.93\%$ , respectively, then


$$ z _ {1} = 0. 0 4, z _ {2} = 0. 0 4 1 5, \text {a n d} z _ {3} = 0. 0 4 4 6 5.
$$

Therefore, the present value of the two-year Treasury security is

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 5 0}{(1 . 0 4 0 0) ^ {1}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 5 0}{(1 . 0 4 1 5) ^ {2}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 5 0}{(1 . 0 4 4 6 5) ^ {3}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 0 4 . 5 0}{(1 + z _ {4}) ^ {4}}.
$$

Because the price of the two-year coupon Treasury security is 99.64, the following relationship must hold:

$$
\$ 99.64 = \frac {\$ 4 . 5 0}{(1 . 0 4 0 0) ^ {1}} + \frac {\$ 4 . 5 0}{(1 . 0 4 1 5) ^ {2}} + \frac {\$ 4 . 5 0}{(1 . 0 4 4 6 5) ^ {3}} + \frac {\$ 1 0 4 . 5 0}{(1 + z _ {4}) ^ {4}}.
$$

Solving for the theoretical two-year spot rate, we would find that  $z_{4}$  is 0.046235. Doubling this yield, we obtain the theoretical two-year spot rate bond-equivalent yield of  $9.247\%$ .

One can follow this approach iteratively to derive the theoretical 2.5-year spot rate from the calculated values of  $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}$ , and  $z_{4}$  (the six-month, one-year, 1.5-year, and two-year rates, respectively), and the price and coupon of the bond with a maturity of 2.5 years. Furthermore, one could derive the theoretical spot rates for the remaining 15 half-yearly rates. The spot rates thus obtained are shown in table 16.2. They represent the term structure of interest rates for maturities up to 10 years, at the particular time to which the bond price quotations refer.

Column 2 of table 16.2 reproduces the calculated yield to maturity for the coupon issue listed in table 16.1. A comparison of this column with the last column giving the yield to maturity of a zero-coupon bond is instructive: It confirms that bonds of the same maturity can have different yields to maturity. That is, the yield of bonds of the same credit quality does not depend on their maturity alone. Although the two columns do not change much at the beginning, they diverge more after the third year, and by the ninth year, the zero-coupon yield is nearly 100 basis points higher than that of the same maturity with a coupon of  $13\%$  and selling at a premium.

Using spot rates to value a bond Given the spot rates, the theoretical value of a bond can be calculated by discounting a cash flow for a given period by the corresponding spot rate for that period. This is illustrated in table 16.3.

The bond in our illustration is a 10-year,  $10\%$  coupon Treasury bond. The second column of table 16.3 shows the cash flow per $100 of par value for a  $10\%$  coupon bond. The third column shows the theoretical spot rates. The fourth column is simply one-half of the annual spot rate of the previous column. The last column shows the present value of the cash flow in the second column when discounted at the semiannual spot rate. The value of this bond is the total present value,  $85.35477$ .

# Forward Rates

Thus far we have seen that we can extrapolate the theoretical spot rates from the Treasury yield curve. In addition, we can extrapolate what some market participants refer to as the "market's consensus regarding future interest rates." To see the importance of knowing the market's consensus regarding future interest rates, let's consider the following two investment alternatives for an investor who has a one-year investment horizon:

Alternative 1: Investor buys a one-year instrument.

Alternative 2: Investor buys a six-month instrument; when it matures in six months, the investor buys another six-month instrument.

With alternative 1, the investor will realize the one-year spot rate, and that rate is known with certainty. In contrast, with alternative 2, the investor will realize the six-month spot rate, but the six-month rate six months from now is unknown. Therefore, for alternative 2, the rate that will be earned over one year is not known with certainty. This is illustrated in figure 16.2.

Figure 16.2

Two alternative one-year investments.

Suppose that this investor expected that six months from now, the six-month rate will be higher than it is today. The investor might then feel alternative 2 would be the better investment. However, this expectation is not necessarily true. To understand why, and to appreciate why it is necessary to know what the market's consensus regarding future interest rates is, let's continue with our illustration.

The investor will be indifferent to the two alternatives if they produce the same total dollars over the one-year investment horizon. Given the one-year spot rate, there is some rate on a six-month instrument six months from now that will make the investor indifferent between the two alternatives. We denote that rate by  $f$ .

The value of  $f$  can be readily determined given the one-year spot rate and the six-month spot rate. If an investor places 100 in a one-year instrument (alternative 1), the total amount in dollars that will be generated at the end of one year is:

Total dollars at the end of year for alternative 1 = \ 100(1 + z_{2})^{2}, where  $z_{2}$  is the one-year spot rate. (Remember, we are working in six-month periods, so the subscript 2 represents two six-month periods, or one year.)

The proceeds from investing at the six-month spot rate will generate the following total dollars at the end of six months:

Total dollars at the end of six months for alternative 2 = \ 100(1 + z_{1}) where  $z_{1}$  is the six-month spot rate. If this amount is reinvested at the six-month rate six months from now, which we denoted by  $f$ , then the total dollars at the end of one year will be:

Total dollars at the end of year for alternative 2 = \ 100(1 + z_{1})(1 + f).

The investor will be indifferent between the two alternatives if the total dollars are the same. Setting the two equations for the total dollars at the end of one year for the two alternatives equal, we get:

$$
\$ 100 (1 + z _ {2}) ^ {2} = \$ 100 (1 + z _ {1}) (1 + f).
$$

Solving the preceding equation for  $f$ , we get:

$$ f = \frac {(1 + z _ {2}) ^ {2}}{(1 + z _ {1})} - 1.
$$

Doubling  $f$  gives the bond-equivalent yield for the six-month rate six months from now that we are interested in.

We can illustrate the calculation of  $f$  using the theoretical spot rates shown in table 16.2. From that table, we know that:

Six-month spot rate  $= 0.080$ ; therefore,  $z_{1} = 0.0400$ .

One-year spot rate  $= 0.083$ ; therefore,  $z_{2} = 0.0415$ .

Substituting into the formula, we have:

$$ f = \frac {(1 . 0 4 1 5) ^ {2}}{(1 . 0 4 0 0)} = 0. 0 4 3.
$$

Therefore, the forward rate on a six-month security, quoted on a bond-equivalent basis, is

$$
8.6 \% (= 0.043 \times 2).
$$

Here is how we use this rate of  $8.6\%$ . If the six-month rate six months from now is less than  $8.6\%$ , then the total dollars at the end of one year would be higher by investing in the one-year instrument (alternative 1). If the six-month rate six months from now is greater than  $8.6\%$ , then the total dollars at the end of one year would be higher by investing in the six-month instrument and reinvesting the proceeds six months from now at the six-month rate at the time (alternative 2). Of course, if the six-month rate six months from now is  $8.6\%$ , the two alternatives give the same total dollars at the end of one year.

Now that we have the rate  $f$  in which we are interested and we know how that rate can be used, let's return to the question posed at the outset. From table 16.2, the six-month spot rate is  $8\%$ . Suppose that the investor expects that six months from now, the six-month rate will be  $8.2\%$ . That is, the investor expects that the six-month rate will be higher than its current level. Should the investor select alternative 2 because the six-month rate six months from now is expected to be higher? The answer is no. As explained in the previous paragraph, if the rate is less than  $8.6\%$ , then alternative 1 is the better alternative. Because this investor expects a rate of  $8.2\%$ , then he or she should select alternative 1, even though he or she expects the six-month rate to be higher than it is today.

This result is somewhat surprising for some investors. But the reason is that the market prices its expectations of future interest rates into the rates offered on investments with different maturities. Knowing the market's consensus regarding future interest rates is critical. The rate that we determined for  $f$  is the market's consensus for the six-month rate six months from now. A future interest rate calculated from either the spot rates or the yield curve is called a forward rate or an implied forward rate.

Similarly, borrowers need to understand what a forward rate is. For example, suppose a borrower must choose between a one-year loan and a series of two six-month loans. If the forward rate is less than the borrower's expectations of six-month rates six months from now, then the borrower would be better off with a one-year loan. If instead the borrower's expectations are that six-month rates six months from now will be less than the forward rate, the borrower would be better off by choosing a series of two six-month loans.

The forward rate consists of two elements. The first is when in the future the rate begins. The second is the length of time for the rate. For example, the two-year forward rate three years from now means a rate three years from now for a length of two years. The notation used for a forward rate,  $f$ , will have two subscripts, one before  $f$  and one after  $f$ , as shown:  $f_{m}$ .

The subscript before  $f$  is  $t$  and is the length of time that the rate applies. The subscript after  $f$  is  $m$  and is when the forward rate begins. That is, the length of time of the forward rate  $f$  when the forward rate begins.

Remember our time periods are still six-month periods. Given the preceding notation, here is what the notation means:

<table><tr><td>Notation</td><td>Interpretation for the Forward Rate</td></tr><tr><td>1f12</td><td>six-month (1-period) forward rate beginning six years (12 periods) from now</td></tr><tr><td>2f8</td><td>one-year (2-period) forward rate beginning four years (8 periods) from now</td></tr><tr><td>6f4</td><td>three-year (6-period) forward rate beginning two years (4 periods) from now</td></tr><tr><td>8f10</td><td>four-year (8-period) forward rate beginning five years (10 periods) from now</td></tr></table>

It can be demonstrated that the formula to compute any forward rate is

$$
{ } _ { t } f _ { m } = \left[ \frac { ( 1 + z _ { m + t } ) ^ { m + t } } { ( 1 + z _ { m } ) ^ { m } } \right] ^ { 1 / t } - 1 .
$$

Notice that if  $t = 1$ , the formula reduces to the one-period (six-month) forward rate.

To illustrate, for the spot rates shown in table 16.2, suppose that an investor wants to know the two-year forward rate three years from now. In terms of the notation,  $t = 4$  and  $m = 6$ . Substituting for  $t$  and  $m$  into the equation for the forward rate, we have:

$$
{ } _ { 4 } f _ { 6 } = \left[ \frac { ( 1 + z _ { 6 + 4 } ) ^ { 6 + 4 } } { ( 1 + z _ { 6 } ) ^ { 6 } } \right] ^ { 1 / 4 } - 1 .
$$

This expression means that the following spot rates are needed:  $z_{6}$  (the three-year spot rate) and  $z_{10}$  (the five-year spot rate). From table 16.3, we know:

$z_{6}$  (the three-year spot rate)  $= 9.9787\% /2 = 4.894\% = 0.04894,$

$z_{10}$  (the five-year spot rate)  $= 13.623\% / 2 = 6.812\% = 0.06812$

Then we have

$$
{ } _ { 4 } f _ { 6 } = \left[ \frac { ( 1 . 0 6 8 1 2 ) ^ { 1 0 } } { ( 1 . 0 4 8 9 4 ) ^ { 6 } } \right] ^ { 1 / 4 } - 1 .
$$

Therefore,  ${}_{4}{f}_{6}$  is equal to  ${9.755}\%$  ,and doubling this rate gives  ${19.510}\%$  ,the forward rate on a bond-equivalent basis.

We can verify this result. Investing 100 for 10 periods at the semiannual spot rate of 6.812\% will produce the following value:

$$
\$ 100(1.06812) ^ {1 0} = \$ 193.2 8 6.
$$

Investing 100 for six periods at 4.894\% and reinvesting the proceeds for four periods at the forward rate of 9.755\% gives the same value:

$$
\$ 100 (1. 0 4 8 9 4) ^ {6} (1. 0 9 7 5 5) ^ {4} = \$ 1 9 3. 2 8 6.
$$

Relationship between spot rates and short-term forward rates Suppose an investor purchases a five-year, zero-coupon Treasury security for $58.48 with a maturity value of $100. The investor could instead buy a six-month Treasury bill and reinvest the proceeds every six months for five years. The number of dollars that will be realized will depend on the six-month forward rates. Suppose that the investor can actually reinvest the proceeds maturing every six months at the implied six-month forward rates.

Let us see how many dollars would accumulate at the end of five years. The implied six-month forward rates were calculated for the yield curve given in table 16.2. Letting  $f_{t}$  denote the six-month forward rate beginning  $t$  six-month periods from now, the semiannual implied forward rates using the spot rates shown in table 16.2 are:

$$
\begin{array}{l} f _ {1} = 0. 0 4 3 0 0 0, \quad f _ {2} = 0. 0 5 0 9 8 0, \quad f _ {3} = 0. 0 5 1 0 0 5, \quad f _ {4} = 0. 0 5 1 7 7 0, \\ f _ {5} = 0. 0 5 6 9 4 5, f _ {6} = 0. 0 6 0 9 6 5, f _ {7} = 0. 0 6 9 3 1 0, f _ {8} = 0. 0 6 4 6 2 5, \\ f _ {9} = 0. 0 6 2 8 3 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

By investing the 58.48 at the six-month spot rate of 4\% (8\% on a bond-equivalent basis) and reinvesting at the foregoing forward rates, the number of dollars accumulated at the end of five years will be

$$
\begin{array}{l} \$ 58.48(1.04)(1.043)(1.05098)(1.051005)(1.05177)(1.056945)(1.069310) \\ (1. 0 6 4 6 2 5) (1. 0 6 2 8 3) = \$ 1 0 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore, we see that if the implied forward rates are realized, the 58.48 investment will produce the same number of dollars as an investment in a five-year, zero-coupon Treasury security at the five-year spot rate. From this illustration, we can see that the five-year spot rate is related to the current six-month spot rate and the implied six-month forward rates.

In general, the relationship between a  $t$ -period spot rate, the current six-month spot rate, and the implied six-month forward rates is:

$$ z _ {t} = \left[ \left(1 + z _ {1}\right) \left(1 + f _ {1}\right) \left(1 + f _ {2}\right) \left(1 + f _ {3}\right) \dots \left(1 + f _ {t - 1}\right) \right] ^ {1 / t - 1}.
$$

To illustrate how to use this equation, let's look at how the five-year (10-period) spot rate is related to the six-month forward rates. Substituting into the preceding equation the relevant forward rates just given and the one-period spot rate of  $4\%$  (half of the  $8\%$  annual spot rate), we obtain:

$$
\begin{array}{l} z _ {1 0} = [ (1. 0 4) (1. 0 4 3) (1. 0 5 0 9 8) (1. 0 5 1 0 0 5) (1. 0 5 1 7 7) (1. 0 5 6 9 4 5) (1. 0 6 0 9 6 5) \\ (1.069310) (1.064625)(1.06283)]^{1 / 10} - 1 = 5.51\%. \\ \end{array}
$$

Doubling  $5.51\%$  gives an annual spot rate of  $11.02\%$ , which agrees with the spot rate given in table 16.2.

Forward rate as a hedgeable rate A natural question to ask about forward rates is: How well do they predict future interest rates? Studies demonstrate that forward rates do not do a good job of predicting future interest rates. $^{6}$  So why do we emphasize understanding forward rates? The reason, as we demonstrated in our illustration of how to select between two alternative investments, is that the forward rates indicate how an investor's expectations must differ from the market consensus for the investor to make the correct decision.

In our illustration, the six-month forward rate may not be realized, which is irrelevant. What is important is that the six-month forward rate indicated to the investor that if expectations about the six-month rate six months from now are less than  $8.6\%$ , the investor would be better-off with alternative 1.

For this reason, as well as for others explained later, some market participants prefer not to talk about forward rates as being market consensus rates. Instead, they refer to forward rates as hedgeable rates. For example, by buying the one-year security, the investor was able to hedge the six-month rate six months from now.

Historical Shapes Observed for the Treasury Yield Curve

If we plot the term structure—the yield to maturity, or the spot rate, at successive maturities against maturity—what is it likely to look like? Figure 16.1 shows three generic shapes that have appeared for the U.S. Treasury yield curve with some frequency over time. Table 16.4 shows five selected daily Treasury yield curves in tabular form.

Sources: The data for 4/23/2001, 4/10/1992, 1/3/1990, and 1/4/2001 are from the daily yield curves provided by the U.S. Treasury. The data for 8/14/1981 are from various Treasury yield tables published by the U.S. Treasury.

Panel A of figure 16.1 shows an upward-sloping yield curve; that is, the yield rises steadily as maturity increases. This shape is commonly referred to as a positively sloped yield curve. Market participants differentiate positively sloped yield curves based on the steepness or slope of the curve.

The slope is commonly measured in terms of the maturity spread, where the maturity spread is the difference between long-term and short-term yields. Although there are many maturity candidates to use as proxies for long-term and short-term yields, we'll use the maturity spread between the six-month and the 30-year yield in our example.

The first two daily yield curves shown in table 16.4 are positively sloped yield curves. The threeand six-month yields are roughly the same for both dates. However, the steepness of the slope is different. The maturity spread between the 30-year and six-month yield (i.e., the three-month/six-month spread) was 195 basis points  $(5.73\% - 3.78\%)$  on April 23, 2001, and 401 basis points  $(7.89\% - 3.88\%)$  on April 10, 1992. The convention in the marketplace is to refer to a positively sloped yield curve whose maturity spread as measured by the six-month and 30-year yields as a normal yield curve when the spread is 300 basis points or less; when the maturity spread is more than 300 basis points, the yield curve is said to be a steep yield curve.

When a yield curve's maturity spread increases (or in the parlance of the market, it "widens"), the yield curve is said to steepen; when the maturity spread decreases (i.e., "narrows"), the yield curve is said to flatten.

Panel B of figure 16.1 shows a downward-sloping or inverted yield curve, where yields in general decline as maturity increases. There have not been many instances in the recent history of the U.S. Treasury market of the yield curve exhibiting this characteristic. The most notable example occurred in August 1981. Table 16.4 shows the daily yield curve for one day in that month, on August 14. Treasury yields at the time were at historical highs. The yield on the two-year was  $16.91\%$  and declined for each subsequent maturity until it reached  $13.95\%$  for the 30-year maturity.

Finally, panel C of figure 16.1 shows a flat yield curve. Although the figure suggests that for a flat yield curve, the yields are identical for each maturity, that is not what is observed. Instead, the yields for all maturities are similar. The yield curve on January 3, 1990, reported in table 16.4, is an example. Notice the very small six-month/30-year maturity spread: 10 basis points. A variant of the flat yield is one in which the yields on short-term and long-term Treasuries are similar but the yield on intermediate-term Treasuries is lower.

Determinants of the Shape of the Term Structure

Two major theories evolved to account for these observed shapes of the yield curve: expectations theory and market segmentation theory.

The expectations theory includes several forms: pure expectations theory, liquidity theory, and preferred habitat theory. All share a hypothesis about the behavior of short-term forward rates, and they also assume that the forward rates in current long-term contracts are closely related to the market's expectations about future short-term rates. These three theories differ, however, on whether and how other factors also affect forward rates.

The pure expectations theory postulates that no systematic factors other than expected future short-term rates affect forward rates; the liquidity theory and preferred habitat theory assert that other factors are also involved. Accordingly, the last two forms of the expectations theory are sometimes referred to as biased expectations theories.

Pure expectations theory According to the pure expectations theory, the forward rates exclusively represent the expected rates. Thus, the entire term structure at a given time reflects the market's current expectations of the family of future short-term rates. According to this view, a rising term structure, as in panel a of figure 16.1, must indicate that the market expects short-term rates to rise throughout the relevant future. Similarly, a flat term structure reflects an expectation that future short-term rates will be mostly constant, whereas a falling term structure must reflect an expectation that future short rates will decline steadily.

We can illustrate this theory by considering how an expectation of a rising short-term future rate would affect the behavior of various market participants so as to result in a rising yield curve. Assume an initially flat term structure, and suppose that economic news subsequently leads market participants to expect interest rates to rise.

1. Those market participants interested in a long-term investment would not want to buy long-term bonds, because they would expect the yield structure to rise sooner or later, resulting in a price decline for the bonds and a capital loss on the long-term bonds purchased. Instead, they would want to invest in short-term debt obligations until the rise in yield occurred, permitting them to reinvest their funds at the higher yield.
2. Speculators expecting rising rates would anticipate a decline in the price of long-term bonds and therefore would want to sell any long-term bonds they own and possibly to "short sell" some they do not now own.[7] (Should interest rates rise as expected, the price of longer-term bonds will fall. If the speculator sells these bonds short and then purchases them at a lower price to cover the short sale, a profit is earned.) The proceeds received from the selling of long-term debt issues that the speculators now hold or the shorting of longer-term bonds will be invested in short-term debt obligations.
3. Borrowers wishing to acquire long-term funds would be pulled toward borrowing now, at the long end of the market, by the expectation that borrowing at a later time would be more expensive.

All these responses would tend either to lower the net demand for, or to increase the supply of, long-maturity bonds, and two of the responses would increase the demand for short-term obligations. Clearing of the market would require a rise in long-term yields in relation to short-term yields; that is, these actions by investors, speculators, and borrowers would tilt the term structure upward until it was consistent with expectations of higher future interest rates. By analogous reasoning, an unexpected event leading to the expectation of lower future rates would result in the yield curve sloping downward.

Unfortunately, the pure expectations theory suffers from one shortcoming, which, qualitatively, is quite serious. It neglects the risks inherent in investing in bonds and similar instruments. If forward rates were perfect predictors of future interest rates, then the future prices of bonds would be known with certainty. The return over any investment period would be certain and independent of the maturity of the instrument initially acquired and of the time at which the investor needed to liquidate the instrument. However, with uncertainty about future interest rates and hence about future prices of bonds, these instruments become risky investments in the sense that the return over some investment horizon is unknown.

Similarly, from a borrower's or issuer's perspective, the cost of borrowing for any required period of financing would be certain and independent of the maturity of the instrument initially sold if the rate at which the borrower would have to refinance debt in the future were known. But with uncertainty about future interest rates, the cost of borrowing is uncertain if the borrower must refinance at some time over the periods in which the funds are initially needed.

In the following section, we examine more closely the sources and types of risk that the pure expectations theory ignores.

Risks associated with bond investment Two risks cause uncertainty about the return over some investment horizon. The first is the uncertainty about the price of the bond at the end of the investment horizon. For example, an investor who plans to invest for five years might consider the following three investment alternatives: (1) invest in a five-year bond and hold it for five years, (2) invest in a 12-year bond and sell it at the end of five years, or (3) invest in a 30-year bond and sell it at the end of five years. The return that will be realized for the second and third alternatives is not known, because the price of each long-term bond at the end of five years is not known. In the case of the 12-year bond, the price will depend on the yield on seven-year debt securities five years from now, and the price of the 30-year bond will depend on the yield on 25-year bonds five years from now. Because forward rates implicit in the current term structure for a future 12-year bond and a future 25-year bond are not perfect predictors of the actual future rates, the price for both bonds five years from now remains uncertain.

The risk that the price of the bond will be lower than currently expected at the end of the investment horizon is called price risk. An important feature of price risk is that it is greater the longer the maturity of the bond. The reason should be familiar from our discussion in chapter 15: the longer the maturity is, the greater will be the price volatility of a bond when yields rise. Thus, investors are exposed to price risk when they invest in a bond that will be sold before the bond's maturity date.

The second risk has to do with uncertainty about the rate at which the proceeds from a bond that matures before the end of the investment horizon can be reinvested until the investment horizon. For example, an investor who plans to invest for five years might consider the following three alternative investments: (1) invest in a five-year bond and hold it for five years; (2) invest in a six-month instrument and, when it matures, reinvest the proceeds in six-month instruments over the entire five-year investment horizon; and (3) invest in a two-year bond and, when it matures, reinvest the proceeds in a three-year bond. The risk in the second and third alternatives is that the return over the five-year investment horizon is unknown, because the rates at which the proceeds can be reinvested until maturity are unknown. This risk is referred to as reinvestment risk.

Interpretations of pure expectations theory Several interpretations of the pure expectations theory have been put forth by economists. These interpretations are not equivalent; nor are they consistent with one another, in large part because they offer different treatments of the two risks associated with realizing a return that we have just explained.[8]

The broadest interpretation of the pure expectations theory suggests that investors expect the return for any investment horizon to be the same, regardless of the maturity strategy selected. To illustrate, let's consider an investor with a five-year investment horizon. According to the pure expectations theory, it makes no difference whether a five-year, 12-year, or 30-year bond is purchased and held for five years because the investor expects the return from all three bonds to be the same over five years. A major criticism of this broad interpretation of the theory is that, because of price risk associated with investing in bonds with a maturity greater than the investment horizon, the expected returns from these three different bond investments should differ in significant ways.

A second interpretation, referred to as the local expectations form of the pure expectations theory, suggests that the return will be the same over a short-term investment horizon starting today. For example, if an investor has a six-month investment horizon, buying a five-year, 10-year, or 20-year bond will produce the same six-month return. Studies demonstrate that the local expectations formulation, which is narrow in scope, is the only one of the interpretations of the pure expectations theory that can be sustained in equilibrium.[11]

The third and final interpretation of the pure expectations theory suggests that the return that an investor will realize by rolling over short-term bonds to some investment horizon will be the same as the return from holding a zero-coupon bond with a maturity identical to the investment horizon. (A zero-coupon bond has no reinvestment risk, so future interest rates over the investment horizon do not affect the return.) This variant is called the return-to-maturity expectations interpretation. For example, let's once again assume that an investor has a five-year investment horizon. By buying a five-year zero-coupon bond and holding it to maturity, the investor's return is the difference between the maturity value and the price of the bond, all divided by the price of the bond. According to return-to-maturity expectations, the same return will be realized by buying a six-month instrument and rolling it over every six months for five years. The validity of this interpretation is subject to considerable doubt.

Liquidity theory We explained that the drawback of the pure expectations theory is that it does not consider the risks associated with investing in bonds. Nonetheless, we have just shown that risk is indeed involved in holding a long-term bond for one period, and that risk increases with the bond's maturity, because maturity and price volatility are directly related.

Given this uncertainty, and the reasonable consideration that investors typically do not like uncertainty, some economists and financial analysts suggest a different theory. This theory states that investors will hold longer-term maturities if they are offered a long-term rate higher than the average of expected future rates by a risk premium that is positively related to the term to maturity.[12] Put differently, the forward rates should reflect both interest rate expectations and a "liquidity" premium (really a risk premium), and the premium should be higher for longer maturities.

According to this theory, which is called the liquidity theory of the term structure, the implicit forward rates will not be an unbiased estimate of the market's expectations of future interest rates, because they embody a liquidity premium. Thus, an upward-sloping yield curve may reflect expectations that future interest rates either (1) will rise or (2) will be flat or even fall, but with a liquidity premium increasing fast enough with maturity so as to produce an upward-sloping yield curve.

Preferred habitat theory Another theory, known as the preferred habitat theory, also adopts the view that the term structure reflects the expectation of the future path of interest rates as well as a risk premium. However, the habitat theory rejects the assertion that the risk premium must rise uniformly with maturity.[13] Proponents of the habitat theory say that the latter conclusion could be accepted if all investors intend to liquidate their investment at the first possible date, and all borrowers are eager to borrow long, but that assumption can be rejected for two reasons.

First, it is obvious that many investors wish to carry resources forward for appreciable periods of time—to buy a house, for example, or to provide for retirement. Such investors are concerned with the amount available at the appropriate time and not the path by which that goal is reached. Hence, risk aversion dictates that they should prefer an instrument with a maturity matching the period for which they wish to invest over shorter-term investment vehicles. If these investors buy a shorter-term instrument, they will bear reinvestment risk—the risk of a fall in the interest rates available for reinvesting the proceeds of the shorter-term instrument. Investors can avoid that risk only by locking in the current long rate through a long-term contract. Similarly, if they buy an instrument with a maturity longer than the time they wish to invest for, they will bear the risk of a loss in the price of the asset (price risk) when liquidating it before its maturity, because of a rise in interest rates. Entirely analogous considerations apply to borrowers: Prudence and safety call for borrowing for a maturity by matching the length of time for which funds are required.

Second, a lot of the demand for and supply of securities these days come from financial intermediaries, which have liabilities with specified maturities. These institutions seek to match as closely as possible the maturity of their liabilities with the cash flow of a portfolio of assets. When constructing such a portfolio, a financial institution will restrict its investments to certain maturity sectors.

To illustrate this preference for maturity sectors, let's consider a life insurance company that issues a five-year guaranteed investment contract. $^{14}$  The insurance company will not want to invest in six-month instruments because of the associated reinvestment risk. As another example, assume a thrift borrows funds at a fixed rate for one year with the proceeds from the issuance of a one-year certificate of deposit. The thrift is exposed to price (or interest rate) risk if the borrowed funds are invested in a bond with 20 years to maturity. Clearly, then, either of these institutions faces some kind of risk if it invests outside its preferred maturity sector.

The preferred habitat theory asserts that, to the extent that the demand and supply of funds in a given maturity range do not match, some lenders and borrowers will be induced to shift to maturities showing the opposite imbalances. However, they need to be compensated by an appropriate risk premium whose magnitude reflects the extent of aversion to either price or reinvestment risk.

Thus, this theory proposes that the shape of the yield curve is determined by both expectations of future interest rates and a risk premium, positive or negative, to induce market participants to shift out of their preferred habitat. Clearly, according to this theory, yield curves sloping up, down, flat, or humped are all possible.

Market segmentation theory The market segmentation theory also recognizes that investors' preferred habitats dictate saving and investment flows. It also proposes that the major reason for the shape of the yield curve lies in asset/liability management constraints (either regulatory or self-imposed) and/or creditors (borrowers) restricting their lending (financing) to specific maturity sectors.[15] However, the market segmentation theory differs from the preferred habitat theory in that it assumes that neither investors nor borrowers are willing to shift from one maturity sector to another to take advantage of opportunities arising from differences between expectations and forward rates.

Thus, for segmentation theory, the shape of the yield curve is determined by the supply of and demand for securities within each maturity sector. This formulation seems untenable: It presupposes the prevalence of absolute risk aversion, but the evidence does not support that proposition. Thus, market participants must be expected to shift away from their habitat when sufficiently large discrepancies occur between market and expected rates. This potential shifting ensures that the differences between market and expected rates will not grow too large, and this consideration leads back to the preferred habitat theory.

# Key Points
- Every economy operates not just with one interest rate but rather with a structure of interest rates.
- The yield spread is the difference between the yield on any two bonds and reflects the difference in their risks.
- A country's government bond market can be used as the base or benchmark interest rate for that country.
- The base interest rate is equal to the real rate of interest plus the expected rate of inflation.
- The risk premium is the yield spread between a nongovernment security and a comparable government security.
- The factors that affect the yield spread include (1) the type of issuer (agency, corporation, or municipality), (2) the issuer's perceived creditworthiness as measured by the rating system of credit rating agencies, (3) the term or maturity of the instrument, (4) the embedded options in a bond issue (e.g., call, put, or conversion provisions), (5) the taxability of interest income at the federal and municipal levels, and (6) the expected liquidity of the issue.
- The swap rate yield curve also provides information about interest rates in a country.
- The swap rate yield curve, or simply "swap curve," is not a default-free yield curve but rather reflects interbank credit risk.
- In many countries, market participants use the country's swap curve as the benchmark interest rate rather than the country's government bond yield curve.
- The term structure of interest rates refers to the relationship between yield and maturity for comparable bonds.
- The yield curve is the graphical depiction of the relationship between the yield on bonds of the same credit quality but different maturities.
- Historically, the yield on Treasury securities is the benchmark rate used for the yield on nongovernment bonds; consequently, the most commonly constructed yield curve is the Treasury yield curve.
- A problem arises with using the Treasury yield curve to determine the one yield at which to discount all the cash payments of any bond.
- Each cash flow in a bond's total pattern of cash flows should be discounted at a unique interest rate that is applicable to the period when the cash flow is to be received.
- Any bond can be viewed as a package of zero-coupon instruments, so its value should equal the value of all the component zero-coupon instruments.
- The spot rate is the rate on a zero-coupon bond.
- The rate on a zero-coupon security can be estimated from the Treasury yield curve using a method known as bootstrapping.
- Under certain assumptions, the market's expectation of future interest rates can be extrapolated from the theoretical Treasury spot rate curve. The resulting forward rate is referred to as the implicit forward rate.
- The spot rate is related to the current six-month spot rate and the implicit six-month forward rates.
- A knowledge of the forward rates implicit in the current long-term rate is relevant when formulating both investment strategies and borrowing policies.
- Several theories have been proposed as to the determination of the term structure.
- The pure expectations theory hypothesizes that the one-period forward rates simply represent the market's expectations of future actual rates; thus, the long-term spot rate would itself be explained fully by the market expectations of future short rates.
- According to the pure expectations theory, the term structure might be positive, negative, or flat, depending on whether the market expects rising, falling, or unchanged short-term rates, respectively.
- The pure expectations theory fails to recognize the risks associated with investing in bonds—price risk and reinvestment risk—when investors buy bonds whose maturity is different from the time for which they plan to hold the bond.
- The price risk of investing in long-term bonds, and the fact that the risk increases with maturity, gives rise to an alternative: the liquidity theory of the term structure.
- According to the liquidity theory of the term structure of interest rates, forward rates are the sum of expected future rates and a risk premium that increases for increasingly distant future rates and, hence, rises with the maturity of a bond.
- The liquidity theory of the term structure of interest rates has shortcomings, because it presupposes that all lenders want to lend short and all borrowers want to borrow long; if so, long borrowers must offer lenders a premium, rising with maturity, to accept the risk of going long.
- In reality, both lenders and borrowers vary substantially in their maturity preferences, with each market participant being able to eliminate risk not by borrowing or lending short but by lending (or borrowing) for a period coinciding with his or her preferred habitat. But at the same time, agents could presumably be induced to depart from their preferred habitat with the availability of a risk premium.
- Although the preferred habitat version of the expectations theory suggests, like the liquidity theory, that forward rates are the sum of a component reflecting expected future rates and a risk premium, that premium will not rise continuously with maturity but will materialize in any maturity neighborhood where supply exceeds demand.
- According to the preferred habitat theory, a negative premium or discount would be expected if supply exceeded demand.
- One theory of the term structure explains the shape of the term structure by the concept of market segmentation.
- In common with the preferred habitat theory, the market segmentation theory recognizes that participants in the bond market have maturity preferences; however, it postulates that these preferences are absolute and cannot be overcome by the expectation of a higher return from a different maturity, no matter how large the return.
- Proponents of the market segmentation theory argue that each maturity is a separate market and that the interest rate in every such market is determined by the given demand and supply; consequently, the interest rate at any maturity is totally unrelated to expectations of future rates.
- This market segmentation theory is of doubtful use in reality, because it implies highly irrational, implausible, and counterfactual behavior.

b. What should the price of the six-year Treasury security be?

c. What is the implicit six-month forward rate starting in the sixth year?

15. a. Using the theoretical spot rates in table 16.2, calculate the theoretical value of a  $7\%$ , six-year Treasury bond.

b. Using the theoretical spot rates in table 16.2, calculate the two-year forward rate four years from now.

Verify your answer to part b by assuming an investment of 100 is invested for six years.

16. "Forward rates are poor predictors of the actual futures rates that are realized. Consequently, they are of little value to an investor." Explain why you agree or disagree with this statement.
17. An investor is considering two alternative investments. The first alternative is to invest in an instrument that matures in two years. The second alternative is to invest in an instrument that matures in one year and at the end of one year, reinvest the proceeds in a one-year instrument. The investor believes that one-year interest rates one year from now will be higher than they are today and therefore is leaning in favor of the second alternative. What would you recommend to this investor?
18. a. What is the difference between a normal yield curve and a steep yield curve?

b. What is meant by a "humped" yield curve?

19. What is the common hypothesis about the behavior of short-term forward rates that is shared by the various forms of the expectations theory?
20. a. What are the types of risks associated with investing in bonds, and how do these two risks affect the pure expectations theory?

b. Give three interpretations of the pure expectations theory.

c. What are the two biased expectations theories about the term structure of interest rates?

d. What are the underlying hypotheses of the two biased expectations theories of interest rates?

4. In practice, the Treasury securities that are used to construct the theoretical spot rate curve are the most recently auctioned Treasury securities of a given maturity (i.e., the on-the-run Treasury issues). As we explain in chapter 20, there are actual zero-coupon Treasury securities with a maturity greater than one year that are outstanding in the market. These securities are not issued by the U.S. Treasury but are created by certain market participants from actual coupon Treasury securities. It would seem logical that the observed yield on zero-coupon Treasury securities could be used to construct an actual spot rate curve, but this approach has problems. First, the liquidity of these securities is not as great as that of the coupon Treasury market. Second, some maturity sectors of the zero-coupon Treasury market attract specific investors who may be willing to trade off yield in exchange for an attractive feature associated with that particular maturity sector, thereby distorting the term structure relationship.
5. The U.S. Treasury no longer issues a one-year Treasury bill. We will assume its existence for the purpose of this illustration.
