With an initial investment from various private investors, in September 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin raised 1 million to start Google Inc., that is, they did not offer Google's common stock to the public. On April 29, 2004, Google Inc. filed an initial public offering (IPO) (a first-time offering of a private company of its common stock to the public) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On August 19, 2004, shares were sold to the public, making Google a public corporation. As explained in chapter 1, financial markets can be categorized as those dealing with financial claims that are newly issued, called the primary market, and those for exchanging financial claims previously issued, called the secondary market, or the market for seasoned securities. It was in the primary market that Google, as well as other startup companies, raised funds through an IPO. The primary market involves the distribution to investors of newly issued securities or seasoned securities issues issued by a corporation to the public. This market also includes the offering of securities of government-owned companies to private investors, a process referred to as privatization.

The participants in the marketplace that work with issuers to distribute newly issued securities are investment bankers, entities described in chapter 9. In that chapter, we described the traditional process of underwriting of securities and how investment bankers perform at least one of three functions: (1) advising the issuer on the terms and the timing of the offering, (2) buying the securities from the issuer, and (3) distributing the issue to the public.

In this chapter, we explain primary markets, focusing on the regulations followed by many developed countries and the various ways in which new securities are issued. In chapter 28 we describe the various financial instruments that can be used by start-up companies to raise funds. We begin with a description of the regulation of the primary market in the United States and then discuss regulation in other countries. In chapter 18, we cover the secondary market.

# Regulation of the Primary Market

Entities seeking to raise funds in every developed country are required to comply with that country's securities laws. In the United States, for example, there are two principal pieces of federal legislation regarding securities, the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). Subsequent legislation has amended various regulations of both acts, with major amendments with respect to fundraising resulting from the major financial crises that have occurred in the intervening years. These amendments include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), and the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act).

In Japan, the Securities and Exchange Law of 1948 is the counterpart to the U.S. Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act. This act and Japan's Commercial Code and Civil Codes are the principal regulations dealing with securities in Japan.

The U.S. federal agency responsible for administrating federal securities laws as set forth in these 1933 and 1934 acts is the SEC. State laws, also referred to as "blue sky laws," are administered by a designated agency responsible for regulating the sales of securities in the state. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is the self-regulating entity in the United States, which in 2007 replaced the National Association of Securities Dealers. In Japan, the Ministry of Finance is the key regulator; the Securities Dealer's Association, an entity composed of member security companies, is the second most powerful regulator. The Canadian Securities Administrators (Canada), Financial Services Authority (United Kingdom), Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Australia), and Commission Nacional del Mercado de Valores (Spain) are examples of the principal regulators in other countries.

In all countries, securities laws dealing with the primary market cover three critical issues: how a "security" is defined,

- disclosure requirements when securities are issued, and
- the solicitation of funds.

# Defining a Security

The securities law of all countries begins with defining what a security is. It is natural to think of the financial products that we describe in later chapters in this book as securities (stocks and bonds). Although the term "security" has been used throughout this book interchangeably with "financial instrument," in terms of security law, it has a far broader meaning than just stocks and bonds. The decision in a 1946 landmark Supreme Court case (SEC v. W. J. Howey Co.) involving land sales contracts has been used to determine whether a transaction falls in the realm of a "securities" transaction. The court ruled that "an investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party." It does not make a difference whether there is a formal certificate or nominal interests in the physical assets that may be used by the entity obtaining funds.

The definition of a security as provided by the Supreme Court in the Howey decision has been applied in the analysis of whether a transaction is a security transaction in matters involving shares in fishing boats, sale of franchises, sale of cemetery lots, and housing cooperative shares. In fact, a 2004 Supreme Court decision in a matter involving the public sale of pay phones by ETS Payphones Inc. found the arrangement to be a security transaction. The transaction involved the sale and leaseback arrangement for pay phones. Although lower courts indicated that this type of transaction was not a security transaction, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that it was, thereby reaffirming the Howey decision. The U.S. courts have ruled that when an investment is made in an entity for a reason other than for profit or financial gain, the investment instrument is not a security. For example, in a 1975 case involving an investment by certain individuals in a cooperative housing project (United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Foreman), the court ruled that the investment by the individuals was for the purpose of obtaining a residence and not for financial gain or profit.

# Disclosure Requirements

There are two basic objectives of the U.S. Securities Act, and they are typically also the objectives in other countries. The first objective deals with the disclosure of information about the securities that an entity is planning to issue. Disclosure is accomplished by the issuance of a prospectus that provides "full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails." The second objective of the Securities Act is to prevent the sale of securities as a result of deceit, misrepresentation, and other fraud. These two objectives of the Securities Act deal with the initial distribution of securities and the registration of those securities, whereas the Exchange Act deals with the secondary market for securities by mandating ongoing periodic reporting of financial information to investors.

In other countries, the securities laws dealing with the primary market regarding disclosure are similar to those of the United States. The prospectus for a new offering is required for entities seeking to issue securities in the European Union (EU), for example. Under the EU rules, when an issuer obtains approval of its prospectus by a member country in the EU, it is valid for the issuance of securities in all EU countries. This is popularly referred to as a "single passport for issuers," and the rationale is that it ensures at least minimum protection of investors regardless of the EU country where the securities are purchased.

Regulators of the primary market throughout the world periodically revise their prospectus requirements. In fact, many countries have regulations for simplified and "plain language" disclosure rules that should be followed by issuers (i.e., the creation of a plain language prospectus). The SEC adopted plain English disclosure rules in 1998 in public offerings by domestic and foreign issuers. Specifically, the SEC expects that issuers comply with six principles of plain English when preparing the summary and factor sections provided on the front and back cover pages of a prospectus: use short sentences; use definite, concrete, and everyday language; use an active voice; use when possible a tabular presentation or bullet points; avoid using legal jargon or business terms that are highly technical; and avoid double negatives. For the prospectus as a whole, the rules require that the issuer be "clear, concise and understandable." There are much more detailed rules than described here, but the key is just better communication about the company, its business, and its risks.

In the same year that the United States adopted its plain language prospectus rules, several other countries followed suit. For example, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission published "Project on the Use of Plain Language: How to Create a Clear Prospectus" that contained sample prospectuses.

A study conducted by the European Commission in 2015 (referred to as a "consultation") identified the shortcomings of the EU prospectus requirements. For issuers, the study reported that the rules constitute a considerable amount of legal paperwork and, particularly for smaller firms, it was costly to prepare a prospectus. The study also indicated that investors found it difficult to read through the hundreds of pages of a prospectus that followed these rules. As a result, in June 2017, the EU adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 to mitigate these problems.

SEC filing requirements Unless an exemption can be obtained or special rules apply (such as for smaller reporting companies), the SEC requires that a company file the documents described in box 17.1. The Securities Act provides for penalties in the form of fines, imprisonment, or both if the information provided is inaccurate or material information is omitted. Moreover, investors who purchased the security are entitled to sue the issuer to recover damages if they incurred a loss as a result of misleading information. The underwriter may also be sued if it can be demonstrated that the underwriter did not conduct a reasonable investigation of the information reported by the issuer.

Box 17.1

Required Filings with the SEC

Registration statement: The initial registration filing with the SEC, Form S-1, must contain financial accounting information, as well as a description of the business, the securities, the risk factors faced by investors, and how the proceeds received will be used. The financial statements that are required to be included are audited balance sheets for each of the two most recent fiscal years, audited statements of income and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance sheet being filed or such shorter period as the company has been in existence, and interim financial statements.

10-K report: Form 10-K must be filed on an annual basis with the SEC within 90 days after the end of the company's fiscal year. Form 10-K consists of the following three sections: (1) a business summary, (2) management discussion and analysis, and (3) audited financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flow, and statement of changes in stockholders' equity).

10-Q report: Form 10-Q is similar to Form 10-K but must be filed quarterly, not just annually, and much less detailed information is required. The financial statements are unaudited but subject to a review.

8-K report: Form 8-K is an occasional filing; it must be filed if a certain event occurs. Examples of such events are entering bankruptcy or receivership, completion of an acquisition or disposition of assets, the departure of directors or principal officers, election of directors or the appointment of principal officers, and changes in control. Form 8-K must be filed within four business days of the event.

Proxy statement: Information about the issues to be voted on by shareholders and management's recommendation are provided in the proxy statement issued by a company.

Forms 3, 4, and 5: Forms 3, 4, and 5 are filings with the SEC that contain information on the ownership of securities by corporate insiders (i.e., officers and directors) and any beneficial owners (i.e., owners of more than  $10\%$  of the company's equity securities), and how that ownership changes over time.

Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G reports: The "beneficial owner" of a company is defined by the SEC as any person who directly or indirectly shares voting power or investment power (the power to sell the security). Schedule 13D, commonly referred to as the "beneficial ownership report," must be filed when a person or group of persons acquires beneficial ownership of more than  $5\%$  of a voting class of a company's equity registered within 10 days after the purchase. Schedule 13G is similar to Schedule 13D but requires less information when the person acquiring the shares is only a passive investor with no intention of altering or influencing the control of the issuer.

One of the most important duties of an underwriter is to perform due diligence. The following excerpt is taken from a court decision that explains the obligation of an underwriter to perform due diligence:

An underwriter by participating in an offering constructively represents that statements made in the registration materials are complete and accurate. The investing public properly relies upon the underwriter to check the accuracy of the statements and the soundness of the offer; when the underwriter does not speak out, the investor reasonably assumes that there are no undisclosed material deficiencies. The representations in the registration statement are those of the underwriter as much as they are those of the issuer.[2]

The filing of a registration statement with the SEC does not mean that the security can be offered to the public. The registration statement must be reviewed and approved by the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance before the security can be offered to the public. Typically, the staff of this division will find a problem with the registration statement. The staff then sends a "letter of comments" or "deficiency letter" to the issuer explaining the problem it encountered. The issuer must then remedy any problem by filing an amendment to the registration statement. If the SEC staff is then satisfied, it will issue an order declaring that the registration statement is "effective," and the underwriter can solicit sales. The approval of the SEC, however, does not mean that the securities have investment merit or are properly priced or that the information is accurate. It merely means that the appropriate information appears to have been disclosed.

The time interval between the initial filing of the registration statement and the time the registration statement becomes effective is referred to as the "waiting period." During the waiting period, the SEC does allow the underwriters to distribute a preliminary prospectus. Because the prospectus is not effective, the cover page of the prospectus states this status in red ink, and as a result, the preliminary prospectus is commonly referred to as a "red herring." During the waiting period, the underwriter cannot sell the security, nor may it accept written offers from investors to buy the security.

A closely related concept is the "quiet period." The SEC prohibits management teams or their marketing staff from making forecasts or expressing opinions about the value of the company prior to an IPO. In addition, for publicly traded stocks, for four weeks before the close of the business quarter, corporate insiders cannot speak to the public about the company's business, usually to avoid the appearance of inside information.

Self-registration rule In 1982, the SEC approved Rule 415, which permits certain issuers to file a single registration document indicating that it intends to sell a certain amount of a certain class of securities at one or more times in the next two years. Rule 415 is popularly referred to as the shelf registration rule, because the securities can be viewed as sitting on a "shelf" and can be taken off that shelf and sold to the public without obtaining additional SEC approval.

In essence, the filing of a single registration document allows the issuer to come to market quickly, because the sale of the security has been preapproved by the SEC. Prior to the establishment of Rule 415, a lengthy period was required before a security could be sold to the public. As a result, in a fast-moving market, issuers could not come to market quickly with an offering to take advantage of what it perceived to be attractive financing opportunities. For example, if a corporation felt that interest rates were attractive and wanted to issue a bond, it had to file a registration statement and could not issue the bond until the registration statement became effective. The corporation then took the chance that during the waiting period, interest rates might rise, making the bond offering more costly.

U.S. exemption rules In most countries, unless an exemption is set forth in a country's securities law, an entity seeking to raise funds through a transaction that is defined as a security must register that security with regulators. Even if an entity can find an exemption to registering the security with regulators, the country's securities law still will have restrictions with respect to general solicitation or general advertising in connection with the offering of securities.

In the United States, the JOBS Act facilitated raising funds by requiring that the SEC amend Rule 144A of the Securities Act, which is a private offering exemption for a nonpublic offering of securities. This exemption from registration applies to the resale of securities to what the SEC classifies as qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). The SEC defines a QIB as a large, sophisticated organization with the primary responsibility of managing large investment portfolios with at least 100 million in securities and that is recognized by regulators as needing less protection from issuers than the typical public investor. Prior to the JOBS Act, Rule 144A required that securities be offered for resale only to QIBs. With the JOBS Act, Rule 144A was amended so that offers of securities can be made to investors who are not QIBs as long as the securities are sold only to persons whom the seller reasonably believes are QIBs.

In the United States, two other exemptions are provided for in the Securities Act: the intrastate offering exemption and the private offering exemption. The Securities Act allows an exemption for securities sold within a state (i.e., intrastate), which is accordingly referred to as the "intrastate offering exemption." The three conditions that must be satisfied to qualify for the intrastate offering exemption are (1) the issuer must be incorporated in the state where the securities are to be offered; (2) the issuer must do a significant amount of its business in the state where the securities are to be offered; and (3) the securities must be offered and subsequently sold only to bona fide residents of the state. The private offering exemption, also referred to as the "nonpublic offering exemption" or the "private placement exemption," exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. Three requirements must be satisfied by the buyers. They must (1) either be capable of evaluating the investment risks and attributes of the security or be able to bear the economic risks associated with the security, (2) have access to the type of information typically provided in a prospectus for a registered security, and (3) agree not to resell or distribute the security to the public.

Private placement of securities Public and private offerings of securities differ in terms of the regulatory requirements that must be satisfied by the issuer. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 require that all securities offered to the general public be registered with the SEC, unless given a specific exemption. The securities acts allow three exemptions from federal registration. First, intrastate offerings—that is, securities sold only within a state—are exempt.

Second, a small-offering exemption (Regulation A) specifically applies if the offering is for 1 million or less, in which case the securities need not be registered. Finally, Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act exempts from registration "transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering." However, the 1933 act does not provide specific guidelines to identify what is a private offering or placement.

In 1982, the SEC adopted Regulation D, which sets forth the specific guidelines that must be satisfied to qualify for exemption from registration under Section 4(2). The guidelines require that, in general, the securities not be offered through any form of general advertising or general solicitation that would prevail for public offerings. Most important, the guidelines restrict the sale of securities to "sophisticated" investors. Such "accredited" investors are defined as those (1) with the capability to evaluate (or who can afford to employ an adviser to evaluate) the risk and return characteristics of the securities and (2) with the resources to bear the economic risks.

The exemption of an offering does not mean that the issuer need not disclose information to potential investors. The issuer must still furnish the same information deemed material by the SEC. This information is provided in a private placement memorandum, as opposed to a prospectus for a public offering. The distinction between the private placement memorandum and the prospectus is that the former does not include information deemed by the SEC to be "non-material," whereas such information is required in a prospectus. Moreover, unlike a prospectus, the private placement memorandum is not subject to SEC review.

In the United States, one restriction imposed on buyers of privately placed securities is that the securities may not be resold for two years after acquisition. Thus, the market contains no liquidity for that time period. Buyers of privately placed securities must be compensated for the lack of liquidity, which raises the cost to the issuer of the securities.

In April 1990, however, SEC Rule 144A became effective. This rule eliminates the two-year holding period by permitting large institutions to trade securities acquired in a private placement among them without having to register these securities with the SEC. Under Rule 144A, a large institution is defined as one holding at least 100 million of the security.

Private placements are now classified as Rule 144A offerings or non-Rule 144A offerings. The latter are more commonly referred to as "traditional private placements." Rule 144A offerings are underwritten by investment bankers.

Rule 144A encourages foreign corporations to issue securities in the U.S. private placement market for two reasons. First, it will attract new large institutional investors into the market who were unwilling previously to buy private placements because of the requirement to hold the securities for two years. Such an increase in the number of institutional investors may encourage foreign-based entities to issue securities. Second, foreign entities had been unwilling to raise funds in the United States prior to the establishment of Rule 144A, because they had to register their securities and furnish the necessary disclosure set forth by U.S. securities laws. Private placement requires less disclosure. Rule 144A also improves liquidity, reducing the cost of raising funds.

# Solicitation of Funds

When an issuer seeks to raise funds, it must use one or more methods for soliciting potential investors, such as direct mailing, advertising, or Internet postings. Securities laws typically cover the methods that may be used by issuers for the solicitation of funds.

In the United States, for example, SEC Rule 502(c) provides guidance on what types of activity constitute general solicitation and advertising; they include placing advertisements in newspapers and magazines, advertising on television and radio broadcasts, and sponsoring seminars to which attendees have been invited by general solicitation. Even with the general guidance provided by the SEC, it is still not simple to determine what constitutes general solicitation and advertising, and it is the SEC's position that what constitutes general solicitation is a matter of particular facts and circumstances.

In the United States, a common exemption that may be used by an entity to avoid the ban on general soliciting and advertising is Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act. This rule allows an issuer to raise an unlimited amount of capital from up to 35 accredited investors and up to 35 nonaccredited investors. The term "accredited investor" has a specific meaning, defined in Regulation D. There are individual accredited investors and institutional accredited investors. An individual accredited investor is an individual who meets certain annual income and/or net worth thresholds. An institutional accredited investor includes such entities as banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and venture capital funds.

In July 2013, the SEC was forced to adopt a new set of rules that removed, under special circumstances, the ban on general solicitation and advertising. This was the result of the JOBS Act of 2012, which was passed by Congress to stimulate economic recovery in the United States by making it easier for small companies and startups to find investors, with the expectation that employment opportunities would increase. Although the JOBS Act directed the SEC to remove the ban on general solicitation and advertising for securities offerings, it still placed two obligations on entities seeking to raise funds. First, sales had to be limited to accredited investors. Second, the issuer of the security had to undertake "reasonable steps" to verify that all buyers of the security were, in fact, accredited investors. This second responsibility of the issuer sounds simple, but its implementation was not, because it came with a complicated set of principles established by the SEC to determine what constitutes "reasonable steps" to ensure that one is soliciting an accredited investor. Despite the difficulty of implementation in practice, the JOBS Act removed restrictions on the soliciting of investors so long as those investors are accredited investors.

# Variations in the Underwriting of Securities

In our discussion in chapter 9 of the role of investment bankers, we described the traditional syndication process; however, not all deals are underwritten using this process. Variations include the "bought deal" for the underwriting of bonds, the auction process for both stocks and bonds, and a rights offering for common stock.

# Issuance via a Bought Deal

A bought deal refers to the offering of a security (stock or bond) whereby an underwriter agrees to purchase all of the security from the issuer at a fixed price without premarketing the deal before purchasing it from the issuer. The bought deal was introduced in the Eurobond market in 1981, when Credit Suisse First Boston (now Credit Suisse) purchased from General Motors Acceptance Corporation a 100 million issue. Although initially used for public bond offerings, the bought deal is now also commonly used for the public offering of equity.

The mechanics of a bought deal are as follows. The lead manager, or a group of managers, offers a potential issuer of a security a firm bid to purchase the entire offering of the security. The issuer is given a short period of time to accept or reject the bid. If the bid is accepted, the underwriting firm has "bought the deal." It can in turn sell the securities to other investment banking firms for distribution to their clients or distribute the securities to its own clients. Typically, the underwriting firm that buys the deal will have presold most of the issue to its institutional clients.

When used in the case of common stock, it is not for an IPO. Instead it is for the public offering of a seasoned equity offering. That is, the company already has common stock outstanding and seeks to raise funds. One method is the marketing of the common stock prior to its offering, which involves a marketing process that can be quite lengthy. The bought deal, which is referred to as an "accelerated seasoned common stock offering," is now the predominate issuance method in North America, and the traditional firm commitment for seasoned offerings of common stock is rare.[5] Studies also indicate that it has become the predominate issuance method in Europe.[6]

For example, in June 2017, Cantor Fitzgerald Canada Corporation, a subsidiary of the U.S. investment banking firm Cantor Fitzgerald, agreed to buy on a bought deal basis 31,250,000 common shares of the Canadian company Prometic Life Sciences for a price  $1.70 per share for gross proceeds of$ 53,125,000.

# Issuance of a Security via an Auction Process

Another variation for the issuance of securities is the auction process, in which the issuer announces the terms of the issue, and interested parties submit sealed bids to receive an allotment or all of the securities auctioned. The U.S. Department of the Treasury uses an auction system for the allocation of its massive offering of securities. The auction process is also used by state and local governments in the issuance of bonds and by public utilities. This process is referred to as a "competitive sale." In the case of bonds, the bidders are individual underwriters and underwriter syndicates. The winning underwriter (syndicate) is the one that bids the lowest interest cost and, on winning the entire offering, reoffers the bonds to its client base.

Use of auction for an IPO The auction process has also been used for an IPO offering. In a traditional IPO offering, an investment banking firm uses its team of equity analysts and its sales force to determine from its institutional client base at what price a firm going public can sell its shares. For example, the Twitter IPO on November 7, 2013, was priced at 26 per share, as determined by investment bankers, Twitter's lead underwriters (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America). An alternative for an IPO is an auction. Starting in the mid-1990s, several firms in the technology sector used this form of IPO issuance, among them Yahoo, Overstock.com, and Google Inc.

Let's first discuss the mechanics of an auction and how the price that winning bidders must pay is determined, and then look at the relative merits of a traditional issuance of an IPO versus an auction. Suppose there are 30 million shares to be issued for an IPO, and the bids and the number of shares are as in table 17.1.

The first column in the table shows all the bids, with bid price shown in the second column. So, "A" represents all investors who bid $50.00, and the number of shares they bid for in the aggregate is three million. Because there are 30 million shares to be allotted, the remaining number of shares (shown in the last column) is 27 million. Looking now at Investors I, at a bid price of $34.00, only two million shares remain to be allocated. Investors J bid at $32.00 for three million of the remaining two million shares. So at a price of $32.00, the market has cleared (i.e., the total number of shares will be sold).

The question then is what price the winning bidders (Investors A through J) will pay. The price will be that of the lowest winning bidder, $32.00. That is, a single price will be paid by all bidders. This type of auction is called a Dutch auction. So, even though Investors A bid for three million shares at $50.00 per share, they will pay only $32.00 per share. Investors K through N will receive no shares. How much will be allocated to Investors J, who bid for three million of the two million remaining shares? All those who bid $32.00 will receive a proportionate allocation. For example, if Mrs. Chen bid for 3,000 shares at 32.00, she will be allocated only 2,000 shares.

For our hypothetical IPO issuer, the amount that will be raised before any fees is 960 million.

In August 2004, Google Inc. used a Dutch auction for its IPO, raising $2.7 billion. The question is: What is the best method for an IPO: traditional issuance using the underwriting process with investment bankers or a Dutch auction? Let's consider the Twitter IPO on November 7, 2013, priced at $26 per share as determined by the firm's investment bankers. The valuation for the firm based on $26 per share was $15.2 billion. The opening price at which it traded on the New York Stock Exchange was $45.00 per share, and the closing price was $44.90 per share. At a share price of $45.00, the valuation of the company was $31.8 billion. Thus, the investment bankers felt the company was worth $15.2 billion and the market thought it was worth $31.8 billion. Somebody's valuation model was off!

Of course, investment bankers argue that their direct purchase of the stock in an IPO offering as intermediaries adds value, because they search their institutional client base, making it likely that the issuer will get the highest price (proceeds) after adjusting for the underwriting fees. However, since the 1990s, the measure of a good underwriting seems not to be the proceeds received by the firm for its IPO but rather the jump in the stock price at the time of issuance. For example, in the case of Twitter, the pricing considerably below what the market suggested on the opening day (about 45) resulted in substantially less proceeds to Twitter. The beneficiaries were those who were fortunate enough to get an allocation of shares from their broker—primarily institutional investors. One of the reasons Google Inc. selected the Dutch auction was because it was viewed as more "democratic": It allowed retail investors to participate in the IPO offering.

One argument put forth by investment bankers as to the advantage of the traditional underwriting process is that the syndicate involved in the underwriting process can support the market price for a period of time after issuance. This is because in most such underwritings, the investment banking firm agrees to stabilize the price in the secondary market to keep it from falling below the price at which it was sold to the public. One might think that this constitutes market manipulation. However, it is permitted by SEC Rule 10b-7, where the SEC sets forth the activities it considers to constitute market stabilization of a new issue and what it considers market manipulation.

A corporation can issue new common stock directly to existing shareholders through a preemptive rights offering. A preemptive right grants existing shareholders the right to buy some proportion of the new shares issued at a price below market value. The price at which new shares can be purchased is called the subscription price. A rights offering ensures that current shareholders can maintain their proportionate equity interest in the corporation. In the United States, the practice of issuing common stock by means of a preemptive rights offering is uncommon. In other countries, it is much more common; in some countries, it is the only means by which a new offering of common stock may be sold.

For the shares sold through a preemptive rights offering, the underwriting services of an investment banker are not needed. However, the issuing corporation may use the services of an investment banker for the distribution of common stock that is not subscribed to. A standby underwriting arrangement will be used in such instances. This arrangement calls for the underwriter to buy the unsubscribed shares. The issuing corporation pays a standby fee to the investment banking firm.

# World Capital Markets Integration and Fundraising Implications

An entity may seek funds outside its local capital market with the expectation of doing so at a lower cost than if its funds were raised in its local capital market. Whether lower costs are possible depends on the degree of integration of capital markets. At the two extremes, the world capital markets can be classified as either completely segmented or completely integrated.

In the former case, investors in one country are not permitted to invest in the securities issued by an entity in another country. As a result, in a completely segmented market, the required return on securities of comparable risk traded in different capital markets throughout the world will be different even after adjusting for taxes and foreign exchange rates. An entity may be able to raise funds in the capital market of another country at a lower cost than raising funds in its local capital market.

At the other extreme, a completely integrated market contains no restrictions to prevent investors from investing in securities issued in any capital market throughout the world. In such an ideal world capital market, the required return on securities of comparable risk will be the same in all capital markets after adjusting for taxes and foreign exchange rates. This situation implies that the cost of funds will be the same regardless of where in the capital markets throughout the world a funds-seeking entity elects to raise funds.

Real-world capital markets are neither completely segmented nor completely integrated but fall somewhere in between. A mildly segmented market or mildly integrated market implies that world capital markets offer opportunities to raise funds at a lower cost outside the local capital market.

Motivation for Raising Funds Outside the Domestic Market

A corporation may seek to raise funds outside its domestic market for four reasons. First, in some countries, large corporations seeking to raise a substantial amount of funds may have no other choice but to obtain financing in either the foreign market sector of another country or the Euromarket, because the fundraising corporation's domestic market is not sufficiently developed to be able to satisfy the fundraiser's demand for funds on globally competitive terms. Governments of developing countries use these markets when seeking funds for government-owned corporations in the process of privatizing.

The second reason is the opportunity to obtain a reduced cost of funding (taking into consideration issuing costs) compared to that available in the domestic market. As we explained in chapter 16, in the case of debt, the cost will reflect two factors: (1) the risk-free rate, which is accepted as the interest rate on a U.S. Treasury security with the same maturity or some other low-risk security (called the base rate), and (2) a spread to reflect the greater risks that investors perceive as being associated with the issue or issuer.

A corporate borrower who seeks reduced funding costs is seeking to reduce the spread. The integration of capital markets throughout the world diminishes such opportunities. Nevertheless, imperfections in capital markets throughout the world prevent complete integration and thereby may permit a reduced cost of funds. These imperfections, or market frictions, occur because of differences in security regulations in various countries, tax structures, restrictions imposed on regulated institutional investors, and the credit risk perception of the issuer. In the case of common stock, a corporation seeks to gain a higher value for its stock and to reduce the market impact cost of floating a large offering.

The third reason to seek funds in foreign markets is a desire by corporate treasurers to diversify their source of funding in order to reduce reliance on domestic investors. In the case of equities, diversifying funding sources may encourage foreign investors who have different perspectives on the future performance of the corporation. Two additional advantages of raising foreign equity funds, from the perspective of U.S. corporations, are the following: (1) some market observers believe that certain foreign investors are more loyal to corporations and look at long-term performance rather than short-term performance as do investors in the United States,[7] and (2) diversifying the investor base reduces the dominance of U.S. institutional holdings and its impact on corporate governance.

The fourth reason is that a corporation may issue a security denominated in a foreign currency as part of its overall foreign currency management. As an example, consider a U.S. corporation that plans to build a factory in a foreign country where the construction costs will be denominated in the foreign currency. Assume that the corporation plans to sell the output of the factory in the same foreign country. Therefore, the revenue will be denominated in the foreign currency. The corporation then faces exchange rate risk: The construction costs are uncertain in U.S. dollars, because during the construction period, the U.S. dollar may depreciate relative to the foreign currency. Also, the projected revenue is uncertain in U.S. dollars, because the foreign currency may depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar. Suppose that the corporation arranges debt financing for the plant, in which it receives the proceeds in the foreign currency and the liabilities are denominated in the foreign currency. This financing arrangement can reduce exchange rate risk, because the proceeds received will be in the foreign currency and will be used to pay the construction costs, and the projected revenue can be applied to service the debt obligation.

Corporate Financing Week asked the corporate treasurers of several multinational corporations why they used nondomestic markets to raise funds. The treasurers' responses reflected one or more of the reasons just cited. For example, the director of corporate finance of General Motors said that the company used the Eurobond market with the objective of "diversifying funding sources, attract[ing] new investors and achieving [ing] comparable, if not cheaper, financing." A managing director of Sears, Roebuck stated that the company "has a long-standing policy of diversifying geographical [funding] sources and instruments to avoid reliance on any specific market, even if the cost is higher." He stated further that "Sears cultivates a presence in the international market by issuing every three years or so."

# Key Points
- The primary market involves the distribution to investors of newly issued securities and seasoned offerings.
- Entities seeking to raise funds in every developed country are required to comply with that country's securities laws.
- In the United States, there are two principal pieces of federal legislation regarding securities: the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).
- The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the U.S. federal agency responsible for administering federal securities laws as set forth in the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
- In all countries, securities laws dealing with the primary market cover three critical issues: (1) how a "security" is defined, (2) disclosure requirements when securities are issued, and (3) the solicitation of funds.
- There are typically two basic objectives of the securities laws in countries: (1) the disclosure of information about the securities that an entity is planning to issue and (2) the prevention of the sale of securities as a result of deceit, misrepresentation, and other fraud.
- Disclosure information is accomplished by the issuance of a prospectus that provides "full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails."
- Unless an exemption is allowed, an issuer of a new security must file certain documents with regulators. In the United States, the following documents must be filed with the SEC: 10-K report; 10-Q report; 8-K report; proxy statement; Forms 3, 4, and 5; and Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G reports.
- In the United States, SEC Rule 415, the shelf registration rule, permits certain issuers to file a single registration document indicating that it intends to sell a certain amount of a certain class of securities at one or more times in the next two years.
- Variations in the underwriting process include the bought deal for the underwriting of bonds and seasoned equity offerings, the auction process, and preemptive rights offering for underwriting common stock.
- A private placement is different from the public offering of securities in terms of the regulatory requirements that must be satisfied by the issuer. Certain provisions in federal securities law allow issuers to be exempt from registering a new issue with the SEC.

2. Why is it critical for the securities law of a country to set forth what a public offering of securities is?
3. "In the United States, the federal government—not the states—regulate the issuance of securities." Explain whether you agree or disagree with this statement.
4. What is the purpose of a prospectus?
5. In the Eurozone, the public offering of securities are carried out under the European Prospectus Directive and allows an issuer that has had a prospectus approved in an European Union member state to use the same prospectus for the securities in any other European Union member state. What is the rationale for the European Union allowing this—which is referred to as the "passport" mechanism?
