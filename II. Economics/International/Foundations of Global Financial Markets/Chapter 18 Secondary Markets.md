In chapter 1, we described the various functions of financial markets. We noted in that chapter that financial markets can be divided into primary and secondary markets. In the secondary market, already issued financial assets are traded. The key distinction between a primary market (as described in chapter 1) and a secondary market is that, in the secondary market, the issuer of the asset does not receive funds from the buyer. Instead, the existing issue changes hands in the secondary market, and funds flow from the buyer of the asset to the seller.

In this chapter, we explain the various features of secondary markets. These features are common to the trading of any type of financial instrument. We take a closer look at individual markets in later chapters.

# Function of Secondary Markets

It is worthwhile to review once again the function of secondary markets. In the secondary market, an issuer of securities—whether it is a corporation or a governmental unit—can obtain regular information about the value of the asset. The periodic trading of the asset reveals to the issuer the consensus price that the asset commands in an open market. Thus, firms can discover what value investors attach to their stocks, and firms or noncorporate issuers can observe the prices of their bonds and the implied interest rates investors expect and demand from them. Such information helps issuers assess how well they are using the funds acquired from earlier primary market activities, and it also indicates how receptive investors would be to new offerings.

The other service that a secondary market offers issuers is the opportunity for the original buyer of an asset to reverse the investment by selling it for cash. Unless investors are confident that they can shift from one financial asset to another as they deem necessary, they would naturally be reluctant to buy any financial asset. Such reluctance would harm potential issuers in one of two ways: Either issuers would be unable to sell new securities at all, or they would have to pay a higher rate of return, because investors would increase the discount rate in compensation for the expected illiquidity in the securities.

Investors in financial assets receive several benefits from a secondary market. Such a market obviously offers them liquidity for their assets as well as information about the assets' fair or consensus values. Furthermore, secondary markets bring together many interested parties and thereby reduce the costs of searching for likely buyers and sellers of assets. Moreover, by accommodating many trades, secondary markets keep the cost of transactions low. By keeping the costs of both searching and transacting low, secondary markets encourage investors to purchase financial assets.

# Architectural Structure of Secondary Markets

Different architectural structures can be used when establishing a secondary market for a financial asset. The two general architectural structures are order-driven and quote-driven markets. Real-world financial markets use a blend of these structures for different types of financial assets. To understand the difference between an order-driven and a quote-driven market, we must make clear who the potential parties are.

The potential parties to a trade include (1) natural buyers, (2) natural sellers, (3) brokers, and (4) dealers. The natural buyers and natural sellers want to take a position for their own portfolios. They can be retail investors or institutional investors.

A broker is a third party in a trade that acts on behalf of a buyer or seller who wishes to execute an order. In economic and legal terms, a broker is said to be an "agent" of one of the parties to the trade. The brokerage activity does not require the broker to buy and hold in inventory or sell from inventory the financial asset that is the subject of the trade. Instead the broker receives, transmits, and executes a customer's orders. In exchange for this service, the broker receives an explicit commission.

A dealer is an entity that acts as an intermediary in a trade by buying and selling for its own account. Basically, a dealer buys a financial asset to place in its inventory or sells a financial asset from its own inventory. A dealer is said to "take a position" in an asset. Notice the distinction between a dealer buying and selling for its own account, which is acting as an intermediary in a trade, and a natural buyer and natural seller purchasing or selling for their own accounts. When acting in this capacity, a dealer commits its own capital to accommodate a trade sought by other parties. Hence, in contrast to a broker, a dealer acts as a principal in a trade. The potential income earned from this intermediary activity is the difference between the price at which a dealer is willing to offer a financial asset to investors (the ask price) and the price at which a dealer is willing to buy a financial asset from investors (the bid price). The difference is referred to as the bid-ask spread.

A special type of dealer is called a market maker. This term describes a dealer that has a special obligation in the secondary market. That special obligation is to use its capital to make an orderly market for designated financial assets.

Order-Driven Markets and Quote-Driven Markets

Now let's explore what is meant by an "order-driven market" and a "quoted-driven market." The difference is based on how trading takes place and how the price is determined. In its purest sense, an order-driven market is one in which all of the participants in the trade are natural buyers and natural sellers—no dealer is acting as an intermediary. The clearing price is determined by the flow of buy and sell orders. Another term used to describe an order-driven market is an auction market.

In a quote-driven market, rather than the price being determined by the interaction of natural buyers and natural sellers, it is determined by the dealer and is based on prevailing market information. The dealer then stands ready to buy and sell a financial asset at the prices it quotes. Because of the role played by the dealer in a quote-driven market, this market structure is also is also referred to as a dealer market or dealership market.

Types of Order-Driven Markets

An order-driven market can be further classified as a continuous order-driven market or a periodic call auction.

In a continuous order-driven market, prices are determined continuously throughout the trading day as buyers and sellers submit orders. For example, given the order flow at 10 a.m., the market-clearing price of a financial asset may be $70; at 11 a.m. of the same trading day, the market-clearing price of the same financial asset, but with different order flows, may be $70.75. Thus, in a continuous market, prices may vary with the pattern of orders reaching the market and not because of any change in the basic situation of supply and demand. We return to this point later in this chapter.

The other type of order-driven market structure is the periodic call auction, in which orders are batched or grouped together for simultaneous execution at preannounced times. For example, a periodic call auction can occur at the opening of the trading day, at the close of the trading day, or at designated times during the trading day. The auction may be oral or written. In either case, the auction will determine or "fix" the market-clearing price at a particular time of the trading day. This use of the word "fix" is traditional and is not pejorative or suggestive of illegal activity. The price obtained for a periodic call auction can be determined through a price scan auction or a sealed bid auction.

In a price scan auction, an auctioneer announces tentative prices and the participants physically present respond indicating how much they would be willing to buy and sell at each tentative price. The market-clearing price is then determined by the price that will balance the buy and sell orders. In a sealed bid/ask auction, the bid price/ask price and the quantities a participant is willing to transact are submitted. Information about the order of a party who participates in the auction is not disclosed to the other participants involved in the auction. Buy and sell orders are then cumulated by price: from the highest bid price to the lowest bid price for buyers and from the lowest ask price to the highest ask price for sellers. The market-clearing price is the price at which the cumulated buy orders equal the cumulated sell orders.

# Trading Locations

In chapter 22, we describe the different types of trading venues for stocks, bonds, and derivative instruments. Trading venues can be divided into exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and off-exchange markets, which mean trading venues that are not exchanges or OTC. Here we briefly describe the first two venues.

In all countries, there are secondary markets that are legally established as national securities exchanges, which we will refer to simply as exchanges. The products traded on an exchange are approved by the directors of the exchange and are referred to as "listed products." For example, in the case of common stock, the product is the stock of a company. However, not all companies' common stock in a country is listed on a stock exchange. The stock exchange will specify requirements for a company to be traded on that exchange. Such a company is said to be a "listed company." Other products that can be traded on an exchange are certain types of derivative products, such as options and futures. In fact, as explained in chapter 33, by definition, a futures contract is an exchange-traded product. Only those who are members of an exchange are permitted to trade on the exchange. The general public cannot trade on an exchange and must trade through an exchange member. The rules for trading on an exchange are set forth by the exchange. Exchanges used to be physical, in-person locations but have evolved to be electronic forums.

The OTC market is simply the market where non-exchange-traded products are traded.

Trading in the OTC market is done by geographically dispersed traders linked to one another by telecommunications systems. In the case of common stock, unlisted stocks are traded in the OTC market. Non-exchange-traded derivatives are traded in the OTC market. (We explain OTC derivatives in chapter 37.) Although some bonds are traded on an exchange, such trading of bonds is extremely rare. Bonds are a good example of a product that can be traded on an exchange but for which the majority of trading is in the OTC market. Foreign exchange (currency) is primarily traded in the OTC market. Derivatives are traded on both exchanges and the OTC market.

The architectural structure of an exchange market can be either order driven or quote driven. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is an order-driven market and is a hybrid continuous order-driven/periodic call auction market. In contrast, the Nasdaq is an exchange that is a quote-driven market but has an element of an order-driven market. This is because the opening of the Nasdaq is a periodic call auction. All OTC markets are quote-driven markets.

# Theoretically Perfect Market Characteristics

To explain the ideal characteristics of secondary markets, we first describe a perfect market for a financial asset. Then we can show how common occurrences in real markets keep them from being theoretically perfect.

In general, a perfect market results when the number of buyers and sellers is sufficiently large, and all participants are small enough relative to the market so that no individual market agent can influence the commodity's price. Consequently, all buyers and sellers are price-takers, and the market price is determined where there is equality of supply and demand. This condition is more likely to be satisfied if the commodity traded is fairly homogeneous (for example, corn or wheat). But a market is not perfect only because market agents are price-takers. A perfect market is also free of transactions costs and any impediment to the interaction of supply and demand for the commodity. Economists refer to these various costs and impediments as frictions. The costs associated with frictions generally result in buyers paying more (or sellers receiving less) than in the absence of frictions.

In the case of financial markets, frictions include:

- commissions charged by brokers;
- bid-ask spreads charged by dealers;
- order handling and clearance charges;
- taxes (notably on capital gains) and government-imposed transfer fees;
- costs of acquiring information about the financial asset;
- trading restrictions, such as exchange-imposed restrictions on the size of a position in the financial asset that a buyer or seller may take;
- restrictions on market makers; and
- halts to trading that may be imposed by regulators where the financial asset is traded.

Short Selling and Its Importance in Financial Markets

An investor who expects the price of a security to increase can benefit from buying that security. However, suppose that an investor expects the price of a security to decline and wants to benefit if the price actually does decline. What can the investor do? The investor may be able to sell the security without owning it. Various institutional arrangements allow an investor to borrow securities so that the borrowed security can be delivered to satisfy the sale.

This practice of selling securities that are not owned at the time of sale is referred to as selling short. The security is purchased subsequently by the investor and returned to the party that lent it. When the security is returned, the investor is said to have "covered the short position." A profit will be realized if the purchase price is less than the price at which the investor sold short the security.

The ability of investors to sell short is an important mechanism in financial markets. In the absence of an effective short-selling mechanism, security prices will tend to be biased toward the view of more optimistic investors, causing a market to depart from the standards of a perfect price-setting situation. In fact, many large and developed securities markets allow short selling, although regulatory bodies tend to monitor this practice more closely than other features of markets. Nonetheless, the prevalence of short selling is clear evidence of its usefulness to the price-setting function of securities markets.

Below we first explain the importance of a having a mechanism for selling short to the functioning of financial markets and then describe the mechanics of short selling.

Theoretical and empirical rationales for short selling Let's first look at the theoretical arguments in favor of short selling. When restrictions are imposed on short selling a security, the price of that security is then set by the most optimistic investors. There are limited trading opportunities for investors who are less optimistic about the issuer's future prospects, which impacts the security's future price. For those investors who are less optimistic about the security's price, in the absence of (or restrictions on) short selling, they would have to sell their holdings. The result is potential overpricing of some securities. The opportunity to short sell such overpriced securities is exploitable only when the overpricing is due to factors that are likely to be revealed in the relatively near future.

Edward Miller builds on this principle by arguing that a substantial divergence of investor opinion about a stock implies a negative expected return. This is because restrictions on short selling prevent unfavorable opinions from being fully reflected in stock prices. Therefore, with restricted short selling, divergence of opinion tends to raise prices, and profits can be improved by avoiding securities with a high divergence of opinion, especially those that analysts disagree about. Miller further demonstrates that because risk correlates with divergence of opinion, the return to risk is less than what investors would otherwise require. This reasoning led Miller to suggest that typical investors should overweight the less risky stocks in their portfolio.

The description of the short selling of common stock in chapter 23 shows that in real-world markets, constraints are imposed on investors who want to sell short. These constraints include transaction costs and the legal and institutional constraints. When such constraints are imposed on certain securities, these securities can be overpriced and thus have low future returns until the overpricing is corrected. Focusing on stocks, Lamont and Jones provide empirical evidence of such overpricing by showing that stocks with high short-sale constraints tend to experience particularly low returns in the future. They also present specific cases where extremely high short-sale constraints led to extremely high prices.

Mechanics of short selling To illustrate short selling with an example, suppose Ms. Stokes believes that Wilson Pharmaceuticals common stock is overpriced at $20 per share and wants to be in a position to benefit if her assessment is correct. Ms. Stokes calls her broker, Mr. Yats, indicating that she wants to sell 100 shares of Wilson Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Yats will do two things: sell 100 shares of Wilson Pharmaceuticals on behalf of Ms. Stokes, and arrange to borrow 100 shares of that stock. Suppose that Mr. Yats is able to sell the stock for $20 per share and arrange to borrow the stock from Mr. Jordan. The shares borrowed from Mr. Jordan will be delivered to the buyer of the 100 shares. The proceeds from the sale (ignoring commissions) will be 2,000. However, the proceeds will not be given to Ms. Stokes, because she has not given her broker the 100 shares.

Now, suppose that one week later, the price of Wilson Pharmaceuticals stock declines to  $15 per share. Ms. Stokes may instruct her broker to buy 100 shares of Wilson Pharmaceuticals. The cost of buying the shares (once again ignoring commissions) is$ 1,500. The shares purchased are then delivered to Mr. Jordan, who loaned the original 100 shares to Ms. Stokes. At this point, Ms. Stokes has sold 100 shares and bought 100 shares, so she no longer has any obligation to her broker or to Mr. Jordan—she has "covered her short position". She is entitled to the funds in her account that were generated by the selling and buying activity. She sold the stock for

$2,000 and bought it for$ 1,500. Thus, she realizes a profit of  $500 before commissions and fees. The broker's commission and a fee charged by the lender of the stock are then subtracted from the$ 500. Furthermore, if any dividends were paid by Wilson Pharmaceuticals while the stock was borrowed, Ms. Stokes must return them to Mr. Jordan, who still owned the stock at the time.

Instead of falling, suppose that the price of Wilson Pharmaceuticals stock rises. Ms. Stokes will realize a loss when she is forced to cover her short position. For example, if the price rises to  $27 per share, Ms. Stokes will lose$ 700, to which must be added commissions and the cost of borrowing the stock.

Note the downside risk for a short seller versus a long buyer. When an investor purchases a stock (i.e., takes a long position), the most that the investor can lose is the purchase price. In contrast, when an investor sells short a stock, the maximum amount of the loss can be significant and not known at the time the stock is sold short. For example, in our illustration, if the price of Wilson Pharmaceutical increases to $50 per share, then loss would be $3,000. A price increase to $100 would result in a loss of $8,000. This is the reason that short selling is a very risky transaction.

# Role of Brokers and Dealers in Real Markets

Common occurrences in real markets keep them from meeting the theoretical standards of being perfect. Because of these occurrences, brokers and dealers are necessary to the smooth functioning of a secondary market.

# Brokers

One way in which a real market might not meet all the exacting standards of a theoretically perfect market is that many investors may not be present at all times in the marketplace.

Furthermore, a typical investor may not be skilled in the art of the deal or completely informed about every facet of trading in the asset. Clearly, even in smoothly functioning markets, most investors need professional assistance. Investors need someone to receive and keep track of their orders for buying or selling, to find other parties wishing to sell or buy, to negotiate for good prices, to serve as a focal point for trading, and to execute the orders. The broker performs all these functions. Obviously, these functions are more important for complicated trades, such as for exceptionally small or large trades, than for simple transactions or those of typical size.

A broker is an entity that acts on behalf of an investor who wishes to execute orders rather than trading for his or her own account. That is, the risks associated with the transaction (long or short) belong to the client (i.e., the investor), not the broker. These functions are performed by brokers or agents of the investor. It is important to realize that the brokerage activity does not require the broker to buy and sell or hold in inventory the financial asset that is the subject of the trade. (Such activity is termed "taking a position" in the asset, and it is the role of the dealer, another important financial market participant discussed in the following text.) Instead, the broker receives, transmits, and executes investors' orders with other investors. The broker receives an explicit commission for these services, and the commission is a transactions cost of the securities markets. If the broker also provides other services, such as research, recordkeeping, or advising, investors may pay additional charges.

# Dealers as Market Makers

A real market might also differ from the perfect market because of the possibly frequent event of a temporary imbalance in the number of buy and sell orders that investors may place for any security at any given time. Such unmatched or unbalanced flow causes two problems. One is that the security's price may change abruptly, even if there has been no shift in either supply or demand for the security. Another problem is that buyers may have to pay higher than market-clearing prices (or sellers accept lower ones) if they want to make their trades immediately.

An example can illustrate these points. Suppose that the consensus price for ABC security is 50, which was determined in several recent trades. Now suppose that a flow of buy orders from investors who suddenly have cash arrives in the market, but there is no accompanying supply of sell orders. This temporary imbalance could be sufficient to push the price of ABC security to, say, $55. Thus, the price has changed sharply, even though nothing has changed in any fundamental financial aspect of the issuer. Buyers who want to buy immediately must pay $55 rather than 50, and this difference can be viewed as the price of immediacy. By "immediacy," we mean that buyers and sellers do not want to wait for the arrival of sufficient orders on the other side of the trade, which would bring the price closer to the level of recent transactions.

As explained earlier, the existence of imbalances explains the need for the dealer or market maker, who stands ready and willing to buy a financial asset for its own account (to add to an inventory of the financial asset) or sell from its own account (to reduce the inventory of the financial asset). At a given time, dealers are willing to buy a financial asset at a price (the bid price) that is less than what they are willing to sell the same financial asset for (the ask price). In the 1960s, two economists, George Stigler and Harold Demsetz, analyzed the role of dealers in securities markets. They viewed dealers as the suppliers of immediacy—the ability to trade promptly—to the market. The bid-ask spread can be viewed in turn as the price charged by dealers for supplying immediacy together with short-run price stability (continuity or smoothness) in the presence of short-term order imbalances. Dealers play two other roles: providing reliable price information to market participants, and, in certain market structures, providing the services of an auctioneer in bringing order and fairness to a market.

The price stabilization role follows from our earlier example of what may happen to the price of a particular transaction in the absence of any intervention when there is a temporary imbalance of orders. By taking the opposite side of a trade when there are no other orders, the dealer prevents the price from materially diverging from the price at which a recent trade was consummated.

Investors are concerned not only with immediacy but also with being able to trade at prices that are reasonable, given prevailing conditions in the market. Although dealers do not know with certainty the true price of a security, they do have a privileged position in some market structures with respect not only to the flow of market orders but also to limit orders, which are special orders that can be executed only if the market price of the asset changes in a specified way. (See chapter 23 for more on limit orders.) For example, the dealers of the organized markets, called specialists and discussed in chapter 22, have just such a privileged position, from which they get special information about the flow of market orders.

Finally, the dealer acts as an auctioneer in some market structures, thereby providing order and fairness in the operations of the market. For example, as explained in chapter 22, the market maker on organized stock exchanges in the United States performs this function by organizing trading to make sure that the exchange rules for the priority of trading are followed.

The role of a market maker in a call market structure is that of an auctioneer. The market maker does not take a position in the traded asset, as a dealer does in a continuous market.

What factors determine the price that dealers should charge for the services they provide? Or equivalently, what factors determine the bid-ask spread? One of the most important is the order processing costs incurred by dealers. The costs of equipment necessary to do business and a dealer's administrative and operations staff are examples. The lower these costs are, the narrower the bid-ask spread will be. With the reduced cost of computing and better-trained personnel, these costs have declined since the 1960s.

Dealers also have to be compensated for bearing risk. A dealer's position may involve carrying inventory of a security (a long position) or selling a security that is not in inventory (a short position). In markets where shorting is common, positions are often referred to as "long only" or "short only." Three types of risks are associated with maintaining a long or short position in a given security. First, there is the uncertainty about the future price of the security. A dealer who has a net long position in the security is concerned that the price will decline in the future; a dealer who is in a net short position is concerned that the price will rise. In short, dealers trade for their own account, while brokers trade for someone else's account, their customer.

The second type of risk has to do with the expected time it will take the dealer to unwind a position and its uncertainty. And this, in turn, depends primarily on the number of buyers and sellers in the market for the security. In a thin market, there is a low number of buyers and sellers seeking transactions in the security, while in thick market there is a large number of buyers and sellers. Finally, even though a dealer may have access to better information about order flows than the general public does, there are some trades where the dealer takes the risk of trading with someone who has better information. This results in the better-informed trader obtaining a better price at the expense of the dealer. Consequently, when establishing the bid-ask spread for a trade, a dealer will assess whether the trader might have better information.

# Market Efficiency

The term "efficient capital market" has been used in several contexts to describe the operating characteristics of a capital market. There is a distinction, however, between an operationally (or internally) efficient market and a pricing (or externally) efficient capital market.[10]

# Operational Efficiency

In an operationally efficient market, investors can obtain transaction services as cheaply as possible, given the costs associated with furnishing those services. The cost of transacting is critical to investors and professional asset managers. Moreover, the SEC has continued to amend the Securities Exchange Act so that investors can obtain the best execution possible. Below we provide a brief explanation of trading costs.[11]

Transaction costs are more than merely brokerage commissions—they consist of commissions, fees, execution costs, and opportunity costs. Commissions are the fees paid to brokers to execute orders, and the commission is negotiable between the investor and the broker. Other types of fees include custodial fees and transfer fees. Custodial fees are the those charged by the financial entity that holds securities in safekeeping for an investor.

Beyond fees, there are hidden costs of trading. Execution costs represent the difference between the execution price of a security and the price that would have existed in the absence of the trade. Execution costs can be further decomposed into market (or price) impact and market timing costs. Market impact cost (or simply impact cost) is the result of the bid-ask spread and a price concession extracted by dealers to mitigate their risk that an investor's demand for liquidity is information motivated. (By a "price concession," we mean the investor will have to pay a higher price when buying and a lower price when selling.) Market timing cost arises when an adverse price movement of the security during the time of the transaction can be attributed in part to other activity in the security and is not the result of a particular transaction. Execution costs, then, are related to both the demand for liquidity and the trading activity on the trade date.

A distinction can be made between information-motivated trades and informationless trades.[12] Information-motivated trading occurs when investors believe they possess pertinent information not currently reflected in the security's price. This style of trading tends to increase market impact, because it emphasizes the speed of execution, or because the market maker believes a desired trade is driven by information and increases the bid-ask spread to provide some protection. It can involve the sale of one security in favor of another. Informationless trades result from either a reallocation of wealth or the implementation of an investing strategy that depends only on existing public information. An example of the former is a pension fund's decision to invest cash in the stock market. Other examples of informationless trades include portfolio rebalancing, the investment of new money, or liquidations. In these circumstances, the demand for liquidity alone should not lead the market maker to demand the significant price concessions associated with new information.

The problem with measuring execution costs is that the true measure—which is the difference between the price of the security in the absence of the investor's trade and the execution price—is not observable. Furthermore, the execution prices depend on supply and demand conditions at the margin. Thus, the execution price may be influenced by competitive traders who demand immediate execution or on other investors with similar motives for trading. Then the execution price realized by an investor is the consequence of the structure of the market mechanism, the demand for liquidity by the marginal investor, and the competitive forces of investors with similar motivations for trading.

The cost of not transacting represents an opportunity cost.[13] Opportunity costs may arise when a desired trade fails to be executed. This component of costs represents the difference in performance between an investor's desired investment and the same investor's actual investment after adjusting for execution costs, commissions, and fees.

Opportunity costs are characterized as the hidden cost of trading. Some analysts suggest that the shortfall in performance of many actively managed portfolios is the consequence of failing to execute all desired trades.[14] Measurement of opportunity costs is subject to the same problems as measurement of execution costs. The true measure of opportunity costs depends on knowing the resulting performance of a security if all desired trades were executed at the desired time across an investment horizon. Because these desired trades were not executed, the benchmark is inherently unobservable.

# Pricing Efficiency

Pricing efficiency refers to a market where prices at all times fully reflect all available information that is relevant to the valuation of securities. That is, relevant information about the security is quickly integrated into the price of securities.

In his seminal review article on pricing efficiency, Eugene Fama pointed out that to test whether a market is price-efficient, two definitions are necessary. First, it is necessary to define what it means that prices "fully reflect" information. Second, the "relevant" set of information that is assumed to be "fully reflected" in prices must be defined.[15] Fama, as well as others, defines "fully reflects" in terms of the expected return from holding a security. The expected return over some holding period is equal to expected cash distributions plus the expected price change, all divided by the initial price. The price formation process defined by Fama and others is that the expected return one period from now is a random variable that already takes into account the "relevant" information set.

When defining the "relevant" information set that prices should reflect, Fama classified the pricing efficiency of a market into three forms: weak, semi-strong, and strong. The distinction between these forms lies in the relevant information that is hypothesized in the price of the security. Weak efficiency means that the price of the security reflects the past price and trading history of the security. Semi-strong efficiency means that the price of the security fully reflects all public information, which includes but is not limited to historical price and trading patterns. Strong efficiency exists in a market where the price of a security reflects all information, regardless of whether it is publicly available.

A price-efficient market carries certain implications for the investment strategy that investors wish to pursue. Throughout this book, we refer to various active strategies employed by investors. In an active strategy, investors seek to capitalize on what they perceive to be the mispricing of a security or securities. In a market that is price efficient, active strategies will not consistently generate an abnormal return after taking into consideration transaction costs and the risks associated with a strategy that is actively managed rather than simply buying and holding securities. In certain markets that empirical evidence suggests are price efficient, investors may pursue a strategy of indexing, which simply seeks to match the performance of some financial index. We look at the pricing efficiency of the stock market in chapter 23.

# Electronic Trading

Traditionally, securities trading has historically occurred mainly in person (e.g., on stock exchange trading floors) or via the telephone (typically in the bond market, as explained in chapter 26). Currently, however, securities buyers and seller are mainly brought together electronically (that is, through electronic trading platforms), which is referred to as etrading, Electronic trading provides virtual trading platforms. Often systems for clearing and settlement of trades are integrated in trading systems. This is referred to as straight-through processing. There are many types of equity and bond electronic trading systems.

- A secondary market in financial assets is one where existing or outstanding assets are traded among investors.
- A secondary market serves several needs of the firm or governmental unit that issues securities in the primary market.
- The secondary market provides the issuer with regular information about the value of its outstanding stocks or bonds, and it encourages investors to buy securities from issuers, because it offers them an ongoing opportunity for liquidating their investments in securities.
- Investors get services from the secondary market, because the market supplies them with liquidity and prices for the assets they are holding or want to buy, and the market brings interested investors together, thereby reducing the costs of searching for other parties and of making trades.
- In general, secondary market structures can be classified as order driven or quote driven, with real-world financial markets using a combination of these market structures.
- Quote-driven markets do not require a dealer, and the prices are determined by the interaction of natural buyers and natural sellers rather than being set by a dealer.
- Order-driven markets can be further classified as continuous order-driven and periodic call auction markets.
- Markets are classified as exchange markets and over-the-counter (OTC) markets.
- Secondary markets may be continuous or call markets or a combination of the two.
- In a continuous market, trading and price determination go on throughout the day as orders to buy and sell reach the market.
- In a call market, prices are determined by executions of batched or grouped orders to buy and sell at a specific time (or times) in the trading day.
- A market can be perfect, in a theoretical sense, only if it meets many conditions regarding number of participants, flow of information, freedom from regulation, and freedom from costs that hinder trading.
- An investor who expects that the price of a security to decline can benefit by selling that security short.
- A mechanism to allow investors to sell short is critical in financial markets, because in the absence of such a mechanism, security prices will tend to be biased toward the view of more optimistic investors.
- Even the most developed and smoothly functioning secondary market falls short of being perfect in the economically theoretical meaning of the term.
- Actual markets tend to have numerous frictions that affect prices and investors' behavior.
- Some key frictions are transactions costs, which include commissions, fees, and execution costs.
- Because of imperfections in actual markets, investors need the services of two types of market participants: dealers and brokers.
- Brokers assist investors by collecting and transmitting orders to the market, bringing willing buyers and sellers together, negotiating prices, and executing orders; the fee for these services is the broker's commission.
- Dealers perform three functions in markets: (1) they provide the opportunity for investors to trade immediately rather than waiting for the arrival of sufficient orders on the other side of the trade (immediacy), and they do this while maintaining short-run price stability (continuity); (2) they offer price information to market participants; and (3) in certain market structures, dealers serve as auctioneers by bringing order and fairness to a market.
- Dealers buy for their own account and maintain inventories of assets, and their profits come from selling assets at higher prices than the prices at which they purchased them.
- A market is operationally efficient if it offers investors reasonably priced services related to buying and selling.
- Execution costs represent the difference between the execution price of a security and the price that would have existed in the absence of the trade; these costs arise out of the demand for immediate execution through both the demand for liquidity and the trading activity on the trade date.
- Opportunity costs arise when a desired trade fails to be executed.
- A market is price efficient if at all times prices fully reflect all available information that is relevant to the valuation of securities.
- Three forms of pricing efficiency are based on the relevant information set: weak form, semi-strong form, and strong form.
- In a price-efficient market, active strategies pursued will not consistently produce superior returns after adjusting for risk and transactions costs.
- Electronic trading (or etrading) brings buyers and sellers together electronically, replacing personal and telephone contact in most markets.
