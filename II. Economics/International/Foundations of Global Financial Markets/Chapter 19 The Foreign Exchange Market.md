- what foreign exchange risk is.

The fundamental fact of international finance is that different countries issue different currencies, and the relative values of those currencies may change quickly, substantially, and without warning. Moreover, the change may either reflect economic developments or be a response to political events that make no economic sense. As a result, the risk that a currency's value may change adversely, which is called foreign exchange risk or currency risk, is an important consideration for all participants in the international financial markets. Investors who purchase securities denominated in a currency different from their own must worry about the rate of return on those securities after adjusting for changes in the exchange rate. Firms that issue obligations denominated in a foreign currency face the risk of the uncertain value of the cash payments they owe to investors.

In this chapter, we provide a review of foreign exchange rates and the foreign exchange rate market. The foreign exchange rate market includes the cash market (or spot market) and the derivatives market. The cash market or spot market is the market for settlement of a foreign exchange transaction within two business days. The derivatives market includes currency futures and forward contracts, currency options, and currency swaps. All these derivatives are described in chapter 38.

# Foreign Exchange Rates

An exchange rate is defined as the amount of one currency that can be exchanged for a unit of another currency. In fact, the foreign exchange (FX) rate is the price of one currency in terms of another currency. And, depending on circumstances, one could define either currency as the price for the other. So FX rates can be quoted "in either direction." For example, the FX rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro could be quoted in one of two ways:

1. The number of U.S. dollars necessary to acquire one euro; this is the dollar price of one euro.
2. The number of euros necessary to acquire one U.S. dollar; this is the euro price of one dollar.

# FX Rate Quotation Conventions

FX rate quotations can be either direct or indirect. The difference lies in identifying one currency as a local currency and the other as a foreign currency. For example, from the perspective of a U.S. participant, the local currency would be U.S. dollars, and any other currency, such as the Swiss franc, would be the foreign currency. From the perspective of a Swiss participant, the local currency would be the Swiss franc, and other currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, would be the foreign currency. A direct quotation is the number of units of a local currency exchangeable for one unit of a foreign currency.

An indirect quotation is the number of units of a foreign currency that can be exchanged for one unit of the local currency. Looking at it from a U.S. participant's perspective, we see that a quotation indicating the number of dollars exchangeable for one unit of a foreign currency is a direct quotation. An indirect quotation from the same participant's perspective would be the number of units of the foreign currency that can be exchanged for one U.S. dollar. Obviously, from the point of view of a non-U.S. participant, the number of U.S. dollars exchangeable for one unit of a non-

U.S. currency is an indirect quotation; the number of units of a non-U.S. currency exchangeable for a U.S. dollar is a direct quotation.

Given a direct quotation, we can obtain an indirect quotation (which is simply the reciprocal of the direct quotation) and vice versa. For example, on October 25, 2013, a U.S. investor received a direct quotation of 1.3805 U.S. dollars for one euro. That is, the price of a euro was  \$1.3805. The reciprocal of the direct quotation is 0.7244, which would have been the indirect quotation for the U.S. investor; that is, one U.S. dollar could be exchanged for\$ 0.7244 euros, which was the euro price of a U.S. dollar.

If the number of units of a foreign currency that can be obtained for one dollar—the price of a dollar in that currency, or the indirect quotation—rises, the dollar is said to appreciate relative to the currency, and the currency is said to depreciate. Thus, appreciation means a decline in the direct quotation.

Although quotations can be either direct or indirect, the problem is defining from whose perspective the quotation is given. FX conventions in fact standardize the ways quotations are given. Because of the importance of the U.S. dollar in the international financial system, currency quotations are all relative to the U.S. dollar. When dealers quote, they either give U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency (a direct quotation from the U.S. perspective) or the number of units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar (an indirect quotation from the U.S. perspective). Quoting in terms of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency is called American terms, whereas quoting in terms of the number of units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar is called European terms. The dealer convention is to use European terms when quoting FX, with a few exceptions. The British pound, the Irish pound, the Australian dollar, and the New Zealand dollar are exceptions that are quoted in American terms.

International Organization for Standardization Currency Code

Currencies are typically identified by reference to their ISO 4217 currency code, as established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The code consists of two parts. The first two characters of the currency code are the country's two-character Internet country code. The third character is the currency unit. The currency code for selected countries is shown in table 19.1. For example, the Internet country codes for the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom (Great Britain) are US, JP, and GB, respectively, and the currency unit for each is the dollar (D), yen (Y), and pound (P), respectively. Hence the ISO 4217 currency codes for these three countries are USD, JPY, and GBP, respectively. The ISO 4217 currency code for members of the Eurozone is EUR.

# FX Rate Determination

Since the early 1970s, exchange rates among major currencies have been free to float, with market forces determining the relative value of a currency. Thus, each day a currency's price relative to that of another freely floating currency may stay the same, increase, or decrease.

A key factor affecting the expectation of changes in a country's exchange rate with another currency is the relative expected inflation rate of the two countries. Spot exchange rates adjust to compensate for the relative inflation rate. This adjustment reflects the so-called purchasing power parity relationship, which posits that the exchange rate—the domestic price of the foreign currency—is proportional to the domestic inflation rate and inversely proportional to foreign inflation.

Let's look at what happens when the spot exchange rate changes between two currencies. Suppose that on day 1, the spot exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and country X's currency is  \$0.7966, and on the next day (day 2), it changes to\$ 0.8011. Consequently, on day 1, one currency unit of country X costs \$0.7966. On day 2, it costs more U.S. dollars (\$0.8011) to buy one currency unit of country X. Thus, the currency unit of country X appreciated relative to the U.S. dollar from day 1 to day 2, or, what amounts to the same thing, the U.S. dollar depreciated relative to the currency of country X from day 1 to day 2. Suppose further that on day 3, the spot exchange rate for one currency unit of country X is 0.8000. Relative to day 2, the U.S. dollar appreciated relative to the currency of country X, or, equivalently, the currency of country X depreciated relative to the U.S. dollar.

# Cross Rates

Barring any government restrictions, riskless arbitrage will ensure that the exchange rate between two countries will be the same in both countries. The theoretical exchange rate between two countries other than the United States can be inferred from their exchange rates with the U.S. dollar. Rates computed in this way are referred to as theoretical cross rates. They would be computed as follows for two countries, X and Y:

$$
\text {T h e o t e r i c a l c r o s s r a t e} = \frac {\text {Q u o t e i n A m e r i c a n t e r m s o f c u r r e n c y X}}{\text {Q u o t e i n A m e r i c a n t e r m s o f c u r r e n c y Y}}
$$

To illustrate, let's calculate the theoretical cross rate between Japanese yen and British pound on August 11, 2018. The spot exchange rate for the two currencies in American terms was 1.27691 per British pound and 0.00902 per Japanese yen. Then the number of units of yen (currency Y) per unit of British points (currency X) is

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 1 . 2 7 6 9 1}{\mathbb {S} 0 . 0 0 9 0 2} = 1 4 1. 5 6 4 3 \text {y e n p e r B r i t h i p o u n d}.
$$

That is, it would take 141.5643 yen to obtain one British pound. Taking the reciprocal gives the number of British pounds exchangeable for one Japanese yen. In our example, it is 0.0071.

In the real world, it is rare that the theoretical cross rate, as computed from actual dealer dollar exchange rate quotations, will differ from the actual cross rate quoted by dealers. When the discrepancy is large compared to the transaction costs of buying and selling the currencies, a riskless arbitrage opportunity arises. Arbitrating to take advantage of cross-rate mispricing is called triangular arbitrage, so named because it involves positions in three currencies—the U.S. dollar and the two foreign currencies. The arbitrage keeps actual cross rates in line with theoretical cross rates.

# FX Turnover

Trading volume (or market turnover) statistics for the FX market is reported every three years by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in its Triennial Survey on Foreign Exchange and OTC Derivatives. The 2016 survey found that the average daily market turnover in the FX market (spot and derivatives) as of April 2016 was US5.067 trillion. Of that amount, spot market trading was 1.652 trillion per day or 33\% of all trading. The balance, 3.415 trillion or 67\%, was therefore turnover attributable to FX derivative instruments.

Table 19.2 shows the currency distribution of global FX market turnover as reported in the 2016 survey for the top eight currencies. The dominate role of the U.S. dollar can be seen by its significant share.

The top eight currency pairs turnover from the 2016 BIS survey are shown in table 19.3. As can be seen, the three most heavily traded currency pairs were the U.S. dollar with the euro, the Japanese yen, and the U.K. sterling (British pound). In fact, the data reported by the BIS indicated that these three currency pairs have been the top three since 2001.

# Market Participants in the FX Market

The FX market is an OTC market that operates 24 hours a day. Market participants in the FX market include the central banks of governments, dealers, nondealer private market entities, and clearinghouses for FX trading.

Although major currencies are allowed to float, in practice, national monetary authorities can intervene in the foreign market for their currency for a variety of economic reasons. Consequently, the current FX system is sometimes referred to as a "managed" floating-rate system.

In the United States, currency-related activities are the responsibility of the Federal Reserve System and the U.S. Treasury. This is because the primary responsibility for international financial policy was delegated by the U.S. Congress to the U.S. Treasury. However, it is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) that actually carries out those activities when managing U.S. foreign current reserves. The FRBNY intervenes periodically after monitoring and analyzes market developments throughout the world.

In 1978, the FRBNY formed the Foreign Exchange Committee (FXC). Individuals from financial institutions that are actively involved in the FX markets in global financial markets are members of the FXC. The three objectives that the FXC seeks to accomplish are (1) serving as a working group to discuss best practices and technical issues in the FX market, (2) providing recommendations and guidelines that can be used for risk management in the FX market, and (3) supporting activities that reduce counterparty risk in FX transactions. This last objective involves clearinghouses for the settlement of transactions described later in this section.

Other countries have entities that play the same role as the FXC. For example, in 1973, the United Kingdom formed The London Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee, which is chaired and administered by the Bank of England.

# Dealers

Because the FX market is an OTC market that operates 24 hours a day, market participants who want to buy or sell a currency must search among different dealers to get the best exchange rate on a specific currency. Alternatively, market participants who want to transact can refer to various widely available bank/broker screens, such as Bloomberg Financial Markets and Reuters. The prices cited on those screens are for indicative pricing only (i.e., a quote which is neither a firm bid nor a binding bid).

FX dealers do not quote one price. Instead, they quote an exchange rate at which they are willing to buy a foreign currency (bid) and one at which they are willing to sell a foreign currency (offer or ask). For example, on September 4, 2017, the following was the bid and offer reported by Reuters for one euro in terms of the U.S. dollar: 1.1883 bid and 1.1884 offer. What this means is that one could exchange one euro for 1.1883 U.S. dollars or pay 1.1884 U.S. dollars to purchase one euro. The bid-offer spread is 0.0001 in terms of euros.

FX dealers are large international banks and other financial institutions that specialize in making markets in FX. Commercial banks dominate the market. There is no organized exchange where foreign currency is traded, but dealers are linked by telephone and cable and by various information transfer services. Consequently, the FX market can best be described as an interbank OTC market. Most transactions between banks are done through FX brokers. Brokers are agents that do not take a position in the foreign currencies involved in the transaction. The normal size of a transaction is 1 million or more.

FX dealers realize revenue from one or more sources: (1) the bid-ask spread (bid-offer), (2) commissions charged on FX transactions, and (3) trading profits (appreciation of the currencies that dealers hold a long position in, depreciation of the currencies that they hold a long position in, or appreciation of the currencies that they have a short position in).

The geographical distribution of FX trading by dealers has been concentrated in the global financial centers in the five countries responsible for  $75\%$  of market activity, according to the Triennial Central Bank Surveys. As of 2016, by far the dominant financial center is in the United Kingdom with a share of  $36.9\%$ , followed by the United States  $(19.5\%)$ , Singapore  $(7.9\%)$ , Hong Kong  $(16.7\%)$ , and Japan  $(6.1\%)$ .

# Nondealer Private Entities

FX dealers in the FX market are acting on behalf of clients for their own accounts. It is the clients who drive the supply and demand for a country's

FX. So let's look closely at who these clients are.

Clients can be divided into two categories. The first category includes any entity that imports or exports goods and services and seeks FX to execute the associated transactions. Importers and exporters include businesses and individuals. Importers need the FX of the country from which the products are received. Exporters need to exchange the seller's currency into the domestic currency. Individuals also need a foreign currency when they travel to other countries. The supply and demand for FX by importers and exporters prior to the 1970s were the dominant factors impacting FX rates.

After the 1970s, by far the dominant factor in the determination of FX rates has been financial transactions by institutional investors.2 Although it is macroeconomic fundamental factors that are the major influence on FX rates, typically, short-term FX rate fluctuations reflect the impact of financial transactions. When a country's FX rate increases (falls) in the short run, it is often due to the belief by investors buying (selling) financial assets denominated in that country's currency expecting a further increase (decrease) in the FX rate.

Appreciation of the U.S. dollar may reflect investors in other countries seeking a safe haven for their investments, which results in non-U.S. investors purchasing the U.S. dollar. A recent example was in the second quarter of 2016, where in general the U.S. dollar had been appreciating relative to other major currencies. Safe haven investing in the United States that quarter resulted from international developments, specifically, the June 23 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union. This investing resulted in appreciation of the U.S. dollar.

The shift from nonfinancial participants seeking currency for imports and exports can be seen from the 2016 Triennial Central Bank Survey, which reports currency trading with counterparties. As noted earlier, daily annual turnover as of April 2016 was US5.067 trillion. Of that amount, about 39\% was with reporting dealers, 52\% was with other financial institutions, and only 9\% was with nonfinancial customers (i.e., exporters and importers).

A risk in transactions is the failure of the counterparty to fulfill its commitment. This risk is reduced by the presence of a reliable settlement system. In the case of financial instruments and FX, there are such systems used by banks.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications is a cooperative society that is a communications network for international financial market transactions that link financial institutions throughout the world. Owned by a group of banks in North America and Europe, the Society allows the member banks nearly instantaneously to transact via messages among themselves international payments and other communications regarding banking transactions. The speed of communications is important because it allows counterparties to respond instantaneously and settle transactions using one of the electronic clearing houses discussed below.

The major clearinghouses include Clearing House Interbank Payment System (CHIPS) and Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS). CHIPS is owned by the 12 commercial banks constituting the New York Clearing House Association. Started in 1971, CHIPS is the world's largest electronic payment system (including FX transactions) for settlement among banks in New York; that is, there is no need for physical exchange of checks or funds to settle transactions. The funds are then transferred via the Fedwire, a communication network linking more than 7,000 banks to the Federal Reserve Banks. Similar to CHIPS, CHAPS is a mechanism for clearing in London.

# FX Risk and Derivative Instruments

Our major focus in this chapter has been on one sector of the FX market: the spot market. Yet, as emphasized in this chapter when describing FX trading activities, transactions in the FX market involve FX derivatives because of the need for market participants to protect against adverse movements in the FX rate. FX derivatives are used to control FX risk. Consequently, to appreciate the need for FX derivatives, we describe FX risk.

Let us consider a financial transaction that needs to control FX risk, because as mentioned, the dominant form of FX transactions is now financial transactions. From the perspective of a U.S. investor, the cash flows of assets denominated in a foreign currency expose the investor to uncertainty as to the actual level of the cash flow measured in U.S. dollars. The actual number of U.S. dollars that the investor eventually receives depends on the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currency at the time the nondollar cash flow is received and exchanged for U.S. dollars. If the foreign currency depreciates (declines in value) relative to the U.S. dollar (i.e., the U.S. dollar appreciates), the dollar value of the cash flows will be proportionately less, leading to FX risk.

Any investor who purchases an asset denominated in a currency that is not the medium of exchange in the investor's country faces FX risk. For example, a French investor who acquires a yen-denominated Japanese bond is exposed to the risk that the Japanese yen will decline in value relative to the euro.

FX risk is a consideration for the issuer, too. Suppose that IBM issues bonds denominated in euros. IBM's FX risk is that, at the time the coupon interest payments must be made and the principal repaid, the U.S. dollar will have depreciated relative to the euro, requiring that IBM pay more dollars to satisfy its obligation.
