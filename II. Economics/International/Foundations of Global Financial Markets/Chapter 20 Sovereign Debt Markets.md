Sovereign debt refers to the debt issued by the highest level of government in a particular country. Sovereign governments occupy a central place in the financial market. Not only are they among the largest single group of borrowers in most countries, but the marketable debt issued by central governments is considered to be the debt in a country that has the lowest default risk. The reason is that central governments borrow in a currency whose value they control. To pay off their nominal debt, governments can simply print more money to pay off these claims. A notable exception is the European Union, where member nations cede control of monetary policy to the European Central Bank. Table 20.1 shows the amount of central bank debt securities outstanding for 18 countries as of year-end 2016. Of the total amount outstanding of almost US20.5 trillion, 59\% was issued by the U.S. government.

Governments generate revenue to service their debt from two primary sources. First, the government has, more or less, the unlimited power to tax its citizens. This power can be exercised in the short run only. In the long run, for governments that must face an electorate in fair and legitimate elections, the electorate has the final say on the legitimacy of any tax policy.

The second source is the perception of unused capacity for additional borrowing. The prospect of additional borrowing depends on the productive capacity of the economy as well as the government's reputation for management of its liabilities.

According to the World Bank, various benefits accrue to a country that has a well-developed securities market. First, a government securities market provides a channel for the transmission and implementation of monetary policy, especially monetary targets and inflation objectives. Second, it provides another avenue to finance budget deficits other than the central bank. Third, the existence of a sovereign debt market can enable authorities to smooth consumption and investment expenditures in response to macroeconomic shocks. Finally, a liquid and well-developed market can almost certainly reduce the interest cost of debt over the medium and long term.

Investors can be domiciled in the country where the central government has issued the bond, or they can be foreign investors. In each of these groups, we distinguish between financial entities—banks, contractual savings entities, and collective investment funds—and nonfinancial entities—nonfinancial firms and individual retail investors. Financial entities are key players in the sovereign debt market. Commercial banks invest in government securities for a variety of reasons. They use these securities to meet liquid asset requirements, manage their interest rate risk, and provide collateral for certain transactions (repurchase agreements described later in this chapter). The contractual savings entities include pension funds and life insurance companies. Their mission is to fund a liability structure. Because their liabilities are long term, they are important buyers of longer-term maturity government securities. Collective investment funds—including bond mutual funds and money market funds—are active participants across the entire yield curve.

In this chapter, we describe sovereign debt instruments and the markets in which they trade. We explain who participates in this market and how the securities are distributed to investors in the primary market and the role of primary dealers in the process. Once securities are issued, they trade in the secondary market. We highlight the role of an efficient and liquid secondary market in financing governments. Important markets related to efficient functioning of the sovereign debt market are also covered. Another important aspect of a well-functioning sovereign debt market is interest rate derivative contracts on sovereign bonds. We postpone discussion of these instruments until chapter 37.

## Types of Securities Issued

Central governments typically issue marketable and nonmarketable securities. Our focus here is on marketable securities. Most sovereign borrowers issue bonds with a fairly wide range of maturities. By doing so, they move toward a benchmark yield which can aid in the pricing of other debt instruments. Governments routinely issue two types of securities—discount and coupon. A discount security pays a single cash flow at the end of its life. The difference between the maturity value and the purchase price is the interest that the investor receives. An example of this type of security is a three-month discount instrument sold by several governments, including the United States and Switzerland. Most sovereign debt issued with an original maturity of one year or less is issued as discount securities. Table 20.2 lists the various maturities routinely issued as short-term securities for selected countries.

In contrast to discount securities, coupon securities are issued with a stated rate of interest, make interest payments periodically, and have a terminal payment equal to their principal value. In some countries, such as the United States, the interest payments are made semiannually. In others, such as in many European countries, interest payments are made annually. Sovereign debt with an original maturity of greater than one year is generally issued as coupon securities. For example, securities issued by the government of Singapore with maturities of two years or longer are coupon securities where the interest payments are paid semiannually, and on the maturity date, a principal payment is made. Table 20.3 lists the coupon securities offered by selected countries. As can be seen from table 20.1, the largest sector of the government bond market is that of fixed-rate bonds.

Note: "Strip" indicates whether the government permits coupon stripping.

In addition to discount instruments and fixed-rate coupon securities, sovereigns issue two types whose payments are not fixed: inflation-adjusted securities and floating-rate securities. Inflation-adjusted securities adjust the payments (either coupon or principal) to investors for some measure of the country's rate of inflation. Floating-rate securities are securities whose interest payments change periodically according to a predetermined coupon formula. The coupon formula includes a reference rate (benchmark interest rate) adjusted with a spread. Developed countries that issue sovereign floating-rate securities include Germany, Spain, Belgium, and the United States. The United States only began issuing floating-rate securities in January 2014. Developing countries that issue floating-rate debt include Brazil, Turkey, Poland, and Indonesia. Two of the largest issuers of sovereign debt, Japan and the United Kingdom, have never issued floating-rate debt. For selected countries, table 20.2 shows whether the government issues floating-rate debt or inflation-indexed bonds. Floating-rate securities and inflation-adjusted securities are described next.

Governments around the world issue floating-rate securities. This type of security, also referred to as a "floater," has a coupon rate that resets periodically according to a predetermined formula, known to as the coupon formula. The coupon formula for a basic floater consists of two parts: a reference rate and a quoted margin.

A reference rate is some benchmark interest rate, such as 3-month LIBOR. The quoted margin, commonly referred to as the "spread," can be added to the reference rate or subtracted from the reference rate. The quoted margin is a function of the level of rates as well as the floater's risk exposure. For example, a floater's coupon formula could be 3-month LIBOR plus 50 basis points. The reference rate is 3-month LIBOR, and the spread is 50 basis points. So for each period, the coupon rate is reset according to the current level of 3-month LIBOR. In January 2014, the U.S. Treasury issued floating-rate notes for the first time. Interest rates rise and fall on these securities, based on the rate on of 13-week U.S. Treasury bills. The Republic of Argentina issued a floater in 2014 that matures on January 25, 2024, with a coupon formula of BADLAR plus 200 basis points. (BADLAR is the average interest paid by Argentine public or private banks for deposits in excess of 1 million.) Another example is the floater issued by the Polish government in 2014 that matured March 28, 2017, with a coupon formula of 6-month WIBO flat. Flat means that the spread is zero. WIBO is the ACPI Polska Poland Warsaw Interbank bid rate.

# Inflation-Adjusted Securities

Sovereign governments, as well corporations, offer securities whose interest rate is tied to the rate of inflation. These debt instruments, referred to as inflation-linked bonds, or simply "linkers," have been issued by sovereign governments since 1945. The earlier issuers of linkers were the governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Israel. The modern linker is attributed to the U.K. government's index-linked gilt issued in 1981, followed by Australia, Canada, and Sweden.

The United States introduced an inflation-linked security in January 1997, calling those securities Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). These securities carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Shortly after the introduction of TIPS in 1997, U.S. government-related entities began issuing linkers.

Different designs can be used for linkers. The reference rate that is a proxy for the inflation rate is changed according to some CPI. In the United Kingdom, for example, the index used is the Retail Prices Index (All Items), or RPI. In France, there are two linkers with two different indexes: the French CPI (excluding tobacco) and the Eurozone's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) (excluding tobacco). In the United States, the index used is CPI—Urban, Nonseasonally Adjusted (denoted by CPI-U), as calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.[2]

Given the reference rate, the design of a linker can be such that over time, the principal or the coupon income is adjusted for inflation between the date of issuance and the payment date of a cash flow. The most commonly used design for a linker today calls for adjusting both the principal and the coupon interest. Before maturity, prices for trades in the secondary market are adjusted similarly. The inflation adjustment is usually done with a lag. This structure is used in the United States for its linker (TIPS), with a three-month lag in the CPI-U.

To highlight the differences between inflation-indexed bonds and traditional bonds, consider two eight-year annual pay bonds—one traditional bond and one inflation-indexed bond. The inflation-indexed bond has a real coupon rate of 2\% annually. Inflation is assumed to be a constant 1\% per year for the next eight years. The traditional bond has a coupon rate of 3\% annually. Both bonds have a principal value of \$100. Payments of the two bonds are presented side-by-side in table 20.4. Note that for the traditional bond, the nominal values for principal and coupon payments remain constant, but their real values decline with inflation. To be sure, nominal values are deflated by 1\% per year with inflation. For the inflation-indexed bond, just the opposite occurs. The real values remain constant, but the nominal values for the principal and coupon payments increase with inflation. Notice the coupon rate in the inflation-indexed bond remains constant, but the coupon payments increase and coincide with the increase in the inflation-adjusted principal. Nominal values are inflated by 1\% per year so as to keep real values constant.

The relationship between nominal interest rates, real interest rates, and expectations of future inflation is thought to be governed by the Fisher hypothesis. As explained in chapter 15, the Fisher hypothesis states that nominal yield is approximately equal to the real yield plus the market's expectation of future inflation. This relationship is an approximation, because it does not include a term for the potential interaction between inflation and the real economy. An implication of this relationship is that the differential maturity-matched yields on nominal Treasury securities and TIPS are often viewed as a proxy for the market's inflationary expectations.

# Exchange Rate-Linked Securities

As can be seen from table 20.1, a small part of the central government securities markets is exchange rate-linked government debt, also referred to as principal exchange rate-linked government debt. The structure of this debt instrument is that the principal depends on the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and some other currency, typically the exchange rate of the issuing country. The two major issuers of this type of bond are Argentina and Germany.

# Primary Markets for Sovereign Debt

In chapter 17, we discussed primary markets. In the case of bond issuance, the primary market is the market where securities are issued for the first time. According to the World Bank, the structure of the primary market for government bonds should accomplish the following five objectives: (1) ensure cost effectiveness; (2) encourage participation from a wide range of investors, including foreign institutions; (3) maximize competition; (4) minimize placement risk; and (5) foster transparency. $^{3}$  The infrastructure of the distribution channel must be well designed to meet these objectives.

The two key issues in structuring a primary market are the type of distribution method and whether primary dealers necessary.

# Distribution Methods

Various distribution methods are used in the primary sovereign debt markets. The three primary distribution methods are (1) auctions; (2) syndications/underwriting; and (3) tap sales. For countries with well-developed markets, the primary distribution method is an auction. Indeed, auctions have proven to be more transparent and cost effective than other selling methods. In developing markets, other methods, such as syndication, underwriting, and tap sales, are used.

Auctions Many sovereigns use either a single-price auction (also called a uniform-price auction) or a multiple-price auction (also called a "discriminatory auction") for all marketable securities issued. In a multiple-price auction, competitive bidders (e.g., primary dealers) state the amount of the securities desired and the yields they are willing to accept. The yields are then ranked from lowest to highest. This ranking is equivalent to arranging the bids from the highest price to the lowest price. Starting from the lowest yield bid, all competitive bids are accepted until the amount to be distributed to the competitive bidders is completely allocated. The highest yield accepted by the sovereign is called the "stop yield," and bidders at that yield are awarded a percentage of their total tender offer. The single-price auction proceeds in the same fashion, except that all accepted bids are filled at the highest yield of accepted competitive tenders (i.e., the stop yield).

To highlight the differences between these two types of auctions, let us work a simple example. Assume a government has €500 million of 10-year bonds to auction off. Bidders submit bids that include a yield and a quantity. The information on the four bids is presented in the table 20.5. Starting at the lowest yield, bids are accepted until the amount to be distributed is exhausted. In our illustration, bids 1, 2, and 3 shown in table 20.5 would be accepted. Bid 4 is shut out of the market and does not receive any securities. The stop yield is  $2.52\%$ , and it is the highest accepted yield (the lowest accepted price). In a multiple-price auction, all accepted bidders would pay the price they bid for the quantity they bid. In contrast, in a single-price auction, all accepted bids will pay the same price at the stop yield, and that price is the lowest accepted bid. In our illustration, the stop yield is  $2.62\%$ , so this the price all accepted bidders will pay.

Table 20.5 Price auction illustration.

<table><tr><td>Bid</td><td>Yield (\%)</td><td>Quantity (millions euro)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2.60</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2.61</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2.62</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>2.64</td><td>200</td></tr></table>

In the United States, the Treasury moved to single-price auctions for all Treasury securities in 1998 after conducting single-price auctions for monthly sales of twoand five-year notes since September 1992. Paul Malvey and Christine Archibald conducted a study of the relative performance of the two auction mechanisms.[5] Their empirical results suggest that single-price auctions broaden participation and accordingly reduce the concentration of securities at issuance. (By "concentration," we mean too many securities owned by too few investors.) Moreover, they also present somewhat weaker evidence that the single-price auctions reduce the Treasury's financing costs. In principle, single-price auctions reduce financing costs by encouraging more aggressive bidding relative to multiple-price auctions. Multiple-price auctions suffer from the so-called winner's curse problem.[6] Conversely, in a single-price auction, all successful bidders pay the same price and have less incentive to bid conservatively. Multiple-price auctions for a given quantity tend to shift the demand curve down and to the left.

The frequency of auctions is a function of the debt management practices of the government and the desire to promote a liquid secondary market. Short-term securities, such as bills, are usually auctioned weekly. In most countries, the day of the week for the auction is fixed. Longer-term coupon securities, such as notes and bonds, are typically auctioned less frequently, usually monthly or quarterly. A well-defined schedule announced in advance is believed to lead to a lower effective borrowing cost.

Syndication In less-well-developed markets with few bidders, auctions may not be the best distribution channel. Instead, governments appoint a group of financial institutions that, for a negotiable fee, will subscribe to the entire bond issue and sell it to other investors. This process is usually referred to as syndication. The key advantage of syndication is that it reduces placement risk when demand for the securities is very uncertain. Syndication also adds value if the government is trying to introduce a new debt instrument. The main disadvantage of syndication is the lack of transparency compared to an auction. Price and fees must be negotiated with the financial institutions that will subscribe to the issue. Auctions are more transparent, because such negotiation is not required.

An alternative method for selling government securities is called **underwriting**. The government establishes a minimum price for a debt issue to be sold. For a commission, the underwriter subscribes to the entire issue at the minimum price. The underwriter can then retain the portion of the issue it desires and sells the rest to other investors.

Tap sales A tap sale is a method of distributing securities that allows issuers to sell additional bonds from past issues. The bonds are sold at their current market price but retain their original face value, coupon rate, and maturity. The British and French governments have issued additional securities using this method. Advantages to the issuer include avoiding some of the fixed costs of auctioning off new securities. This method is used for issuing a small principal amount of a security when the cost of a new issue is prohibitive.

A key component of the primary market for any government's securities is the participation of a group of primary dealers. A primary dealer is a designated intermediary who, in exchange for special status, is obligated to be a meaningful participant in the primary market and an active market maker in the secondary market. A primary dealer is usually designated by the central bank. By "active market maker," we mean a dealer willing and able to quote two-way prices (bids and offers) for some or all securities. The risk of endowing a small group of financial institutions special status is that it might encourage collusion. This prospect is more likely when fewer primary dealers are involved and the markets are less well developed. To preclude this possibility, how primary dealers are selected, organized, and monitored becomes an important policy decision.

In the United States, primary dealers are specially designated banks and investment banks that are selected and regulated by the Federal Reserve. They are invariably large and well capitalized. Being a primary dealer has benefits as well as obligations. Primary dealers have the exclusive right to trade with the Federal Reserve when it is conducting open market operations. Primary dealers are expected to be active participants in the Treasury primary and secondary markets and to quote two-sided markets. The Federal Reserve actively monitors the participation of primary dealers, and if their performance is found to be wanting, the firm risks removal from the primary dealer list.

As another example, Italy established a primary dealer system of 16 dealers or specialists in 1994 under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. The specialists consist of both investment and commercial banks, including foreign institutions. They are obligated to bid at government securities auctions and quote two-way prices in the secondary market. In exchange, the specialists garner exclusive access to tap sales and buybacks.[7] Specialist status is reviewed every two years.

# Secondary Markets

As explained in chapter 18, secondary markets are where previously issued securities are traded among investors. Securities can be traded directly from investor to investor, or through a broker or primary dealer to facilitate the transaction. The major participants in secondary government bond markets globally are large institutional investors and central banks. The presence of retail investors in secondary government securities market is small.

The secondary market for government securities must provide for the immediate purchase and sale of securities. According to the World Bank, transactions in the secondary market should possess the following characteristics: (1) low transaction costs, (2) continuous and widely disseminated price information, (3) immediate execution of trades, (4) a safe and rapid settlement system, and (5) efficient custodial and safekeeping services.

A hallmark of a liquid, well-developed market is how it handles spot transactions. A spot transaction is the immediate purchase and sale of a security. An important gauge of a market's efficiency is the amount of time between trade execution and settlement. The shorter the gap is, the more cash-like securities become. Settlement is the process that occurs after the trade is made. The bonds are delivered to the buyer for payment received from the seller. Secondary market settlement for government bonds typically takes place on a  $\mathrm{T} + 1$  basis—that is, the day after the transaction date. Cash settlement, in which trading and settlement occur the same day, is standard for most governments in developed secondary markets. Trades clear in either (or both) of the two main clearing systems, Euroclear and Clearstream. Settlement occurs by means of a simultaneous exchange of bonds for cash on the books of the clearing system. An electronic bridge connecting Euroclear and Clearstream allows transfer of bonds from one system to the other.

In Japan, the Bank of Japan oversees the payment and settlement systems and provides settlement accounts on those systems. For securities settlement, the Bank of Japan is responsible for settling all Japanese government bond transactions. Japanese government bond transactions are settled on a real time delivery-versus-payment basis through BOJ-NET JBG Services, an online system for transferring Japanese government bonds between financial institutions.

Secondary markets are mainly structured in one of two ways: as an organized exchange or as an OTC market. An organized exchange provides a place where buyers and sellers can meet to arrange their trades. Although buy or sell orders may come from anywhere, the transaction must take place at the exchange according to the rules imposed by the exchange. In contrast, with OTC markets, buy and sell orders initiated from various locations are matched through a communications network. Thus, OTC markets need electronic trading platforms, through which users submit buy and sell orders. Bloomberg Fixed Income Electronic Trading platform is an example of such a platform, through which dealers stand ready to trade in multiple bond markets globally. Although there is some trading of government bonds and very active corporate bonds on many stock exchanges around the world, nearly all bonds are traded in OTC markets.

The secondary market for U.S. Treasuries is an OTC market where a group of U.S. government securities dealers offers continuous bid and ask prices on outstanding Treasuries for a virtual 24-hour trading of Treasury securities. The three primary trading locations are New York, London, and Tokyo. The normal settlement period for Treasury securities is the business day after the transaction day ("next day" settlement).

The most recently auctioned issue of a particular maturity Treasury is referred to as the on-the-run issue or the current issue. For example, the most recently issued 10-year Treasury notes is called the on-the-run 10-year or the current 10-year. Securities that are replaced by the on-the-run issue are called off-the-run issues. Sometimes traders use the terms "one-off-the-run" and "two-off-the-run" to indicate how recently a Treasury was issued. Issues replaced by several on-the-run issues are said to be "well-off-the-run issues."

Despite the huge volume of trading in the secondary market for government securities, the reporting of trades (i.e., the transparency of the market) is not at the level of that of U.S. common stocks. However, the reporting of government securities transactions has made some major strides since 1991. These developments came from the private sector. The prominent example is GovPX. This firm, created in 1990 by primary dealers and interdealer brokers (described below) in the government securities market, provides 24-hour, worldwide distribution of government securities information as transacted by market participants through interdealer brokers. The information reported by GovPX consists of the price and size of the best bid and offer, and current repo rates and volume (intraday updates) for repo transactions. The information reported by this firm is primarily distributed as an optional service through the major market data vendors (Bloomberg, Reuters, and Telerate) and to client sites.

Treasury dealers trade with the investing public and with other dealer firms. When they trade with each other, it is through intermediaries known as interdealer brokers. Dealers use interdealer brokers because of the speed and efficiency with which trades can be accomplished. Interdealer brokers do not trade for their own account, keeping the names of the dealers involved in the trades confidential. Interdealer brokers match buyers and sellers of Treasury securities (anonymously) and receive a brokerage fee if a match can be obtained. The quotations provided on the government dealer screens represent prices in the "inside" or "interdealer" market.

Stripping and Reconstitution

Longer-term zero-coupon securities are not typically issued by sovereign governments. Instead, they are created by market participants using a process called "stripping and reconstitution." Market participants have the ability to separate the bond's individual coupon payments and trade them as separate zero-coupon securities. This process is called stripping. Moreover, dealers can recombine the appropriate individual zero-coupon securities and reproduce the underlying coupon sovereign debt instrument. To do so, the entity that seeks to reconstitute a security must obtain the appropriate principal strip and all unmatured interest components for the security being reconstituted. This process is called reconstitution.

To illustrate this process, consider a  $2\%$  coupon U.K. gilt issued by the British government that matures on September 7, 2025. There are two series of gilts that are strippable. The first series, those coupon-paying instruments whose coupon dates are June 7 and December 7, became strippable in December 1997. The second series, those paying coupons on March 7 and September 7, became strippable in April 2002. Only gilt-edged market makers, the British Treasury, and The Bank of England may strip and reconstitute gilts. All stripping and reconstituting of gilts is done through the Gilt Strips Facility.

Table 20.6 is a representation of the 21 remaining payments—20 coupon payments of £10,000 and a maturity value payment of £1,000,000. Each one of these payments can trade separately from the whole as a zero-coupon bond that matures on the day it is due. A distinction is made between zero-coupon securities derived from coupon payments and those derived from principal payments. Zero-coupon securities created from coupon payments are called "coupon strips." Zero-coupon securities created from principal payments are called "principal strips."

Table 20.6 Total payments of a  $2\%$  gilt to be stripped.

Note: The table entries list the date of payment followed by the amount of the payment.

In many countries, a disadvantage of a taxable entity investing in government strips is that accrued interest is taxed each year, even though interest is not paid. Thus, these instruments are negative cash flow instruments until the maturity date. They are negative cash flows, because tax payments on interest earned but not received must be made. One reason for distinguishing between strips created from the principal and those created from the coupon is that some non-U.S. buyers have a preference for strips created from the principal (i.e., principal strips) because of the tax treatment of the interest in their home country. Some country's tax laws treat the interest as a capital gain if the principal strip is purchased. The capital gain receives a preferential tax treatment (i.e., lower rate) compared to ordinary income.

# Repurchase Agreements

A repurchase agreement (or simply "repo") is the sale of a security with a simultaneous agreement by the seller to buy the same security back at a future date from the purchaser at an agreed-on price. $^{8}$  In practical terms, a repurchase agreement can be viewed as a collateralized loan where the security sold and subsequently repurchased represents the collateral posted. One party is borrowing money and providing collateral for the loan at an interest rate. The interest rate, referred to as the repo rate, is typically lower than the rate on an otherwise similar bank loan. The other party is lending money while accepting a security as collateral for the loan. Therefore, the seller in a repo is effectively a secured lender.

Repos are a common source of funding for dealer firms in many countries around the world. An active market in repos underpins every liquid bond market. Financial and nonfinancial institutions participate actively in the market as both sellers and buyers of collateral, depending on their circumstances. Central banks are also active users of repurchase agreements in their daily money market operations, to either lend to the market to increase the supply of funds or withdraw surplus funds from the market.

Structure of repo and reverse repurchase agreements Consider a dealer that has a forecast on the direction of interest rates in a country and this forecast is expected to materialize over the next 24 hours. The dealer decides to take a long position in that country's 10-year government security.

How will the dealer finance the position in the government security? Suppose the dealer wants to fund the position overnight and through the next business day. The dealer has two basic choices—use its own funds or borrow the funds. Dealers usually opt to employ leverage to fund the position. The dealer could borrow the money from a bank. However, in these circumstances, the dealer chooses to enter into a repo to fund the position. As noted above, a repo is a collateralized loan where one party is providing collateral and borrowing money and the counterparty is accepting collateral and lending money. A repurchase agreement may be constructed as follows: The dealer sells the 30-year government security to a counterparty for cash today. At the same time, the dealer makes a promise to buy the same 30-year government security on the next business day for an agreed-on price. The price at which the dealer repurchases the gilt is known as the repurchase price. The date when the 30-year government security is repurchased, the next business day in this example, is called the repurchase date. When the term of a repurchase agreement is one day, it is called an "overnight repo," which can be rolled over. When the agreement is for more than one day, it is called a term repo.

Just as there is no single interest rate, there is no one repo rate. The rate varies from agreement to agreement owing to various factors: quality of the collateral, term of the repo, delivery requirement, availability of the collateral, and the prevailing rates on alternative fund sources. In the United States, the alternative funding sources would be the federal funds rate for some institutions. The repo rate is inversely related to the quality of the collateral. Rates differ by maturity and the current shape of the benchmark yield curve. If delivery of the collateral is required, the repo rate will be lower. The more difficult it is to obtain the collateral, the lower the repo rate will be. The more difficult it is to obtain the collateral, the lower the repo rate will be. To understand why this is so, remember that the borrower (or equivalently, the seller of the collateral) has a security that lenders of cash want, for whatever reason. Such collateral is referred to as hot collateral or special collateral. Collateral that does not have this characteristic is referred to as general collateral. The party that needs the hot collateral will be willing to lend funds at a lower repo rate to obtain the collateral.

In the example above, a dealer is using a repurchase agreement to fund a long position in a 30-year government security. Simply put, the dealer is borrowing money. A repurchase agreement can also be used to borrow securities to establish a short position. In this case, the dealer is lending money and accepting securities the dealer wants as collateral. The counterparty is borrowing money and providing securities as collateral. This transaction is called a reverse repurchase agreement or simply a "reverse." In market parlance, what distinguishes a repo from a reverse repo is always viewed from the perspective of the dealer. If the dealer is borrowing money, it is a repo. If the dealer is borrowing securities, it is a reverse. Both types of transaction are otherwise structured the same.

# Sovereign Credit Risk

Sovereign debt exposes investors to credit risk as varied as that observed in other debt markets discussed in this book. Sovereign ratings are credit ratings for countries as assigned by the credit rating agencies that we described in chapter 5. Specifically, sovereign ratings are assessments of the relative likelihood that a borrower (i.e., a central government) will default on its obligations. Governments seek these credit ratings to increase their access to international capital markets. Sovereign ratings matter to investors, because other things being equal, investors prefer rated issues to unrated ones. They matter to borrowers as well, because the rating agencies are reluctant to assign a credit rating to a lower level of government or corporation that is higher than that of the issuer's home country.

Two sovereign debt ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies: a local currency debt rating and a foreign currency debt rating. The two general categories of risk analyzed when assigning ratings are economic risk and political risk. The former category is an assessment of the ability of a government to satisfy its obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses are used when assessing economic risk. Political risk is an assessment of the willingness of a government to satisfy its obligations. A government may have the ability but may be unwilling to pay. Political risk is assessed based on qualitative analysis of the political factors that influence a government's economic policies.

The reason for distinguishing between local debt ratings and foreign currency debt ratings is that historically, the default frequency differs by the currency denomination of the debt. Specifically, defaults have been greater on foreign currency-denominated debt. The reason for the difference in default rates for local currency debt and foreign currency debt is that if a government is willing to raise taxes and control its domestic financial system, it can generate sufficient local currency to meet its local currency debt obligation. This is not the case with foreign currency-denominated debt. A national government must purchase foreign currency to meet a debt obligation in that foreign currency and therefore has less control with respect to its exchange rate. Thus, a significant depreciation of the local currency relative to a foreign currency in which a debt obligation is denominated will impair a national government's ability to satisfy such obligations. This distinction is not observed with the 17 countries of the European Union's

Eurozone, where there is only a single credit rating for a sovereign's issues, irrespective of what currency the country is issuing.

Those borrowers perceived to have the lowest default risk receive the coveted AAA/Aaa rating from the three credit rating agencies. As of year-end 2015, only nine sovereign issuers are rated at this (theoretically) risk-free level (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland). The 2007-2009 global financial crisis resulted in many sovereign issuers taking on potentially unsustainable debt loads when they took over the liabilities of their country's failed banks. Subsequently, many sovereigns suffered downgrades from the AAA/Aaa level, including Ireland in 2009 and Spain in 2010. In August 2011, one rating agency, S&P, lowered the AAA credit rating of the United States for the first time since assigning sovereign credit ratings in 1917.

A country whose domestic currency is a liquid currency, and which boasts a sizeable domestic institutional savings base, has the capacity to fund its debt in local currency. However, where there is a demand for it, either from foreign investors or for issues in another currency, a sovereign may also issue in a foreign currency. When this occurs, it will usually swap the proceeds into its local currency. A demand for a particular sovereign name from different investors may cause the issuer to raise debt in a foreign currency; this is common for highly rated borrowers, such as Switzerland, Finland, and Sweden, which issue U.S. dollar and euro debt.

The factors analyzed when assessing the creditworthiness of a national government's local currency debt and foreign currency debt will differ to some extent. When assessing the credit quality of local currency debt, for example, one rating agency, S&P, emphasizes domestic government policies that foster or impede timely debt service.

When assigning a rating for a country's foreign currency debt, credit analysis by S&P focuses on the interaction of domestic and foreign government policies. S&P analyzes a country's balance of payments and the structure of its external balance sheet. The areas of analysis with respect to its external balance sheet are the net public debt, total net external debt, and net external liabilities.

Moody's, another major rating agency, focuses on the following four factors as the foundation of its sovereign bond ratings methodology: (1) economic strength—wealth, size, diversification, and long-term potential; (2) institutional strength—governance, quality of institutions, and policy predictability; (3) government financial strength—ability to deploy resources to face current and expected liabilities; and (4) susceptibility to event risk—risk of sudden change in risk migration.[10]

# Key Points
- Sovereign debt refers to the debt issued by the highest level of government in a particular country.
- There are two types of government securities issued—discount and coupon.
- A discount security pays a single cash flow at the end of its life; the difference between the maturity value and the purchase price is the interest that the investor receives.
- Coupon securities are issued with a stated rate of interest, make interest payments periodically, and have terminal payments equal to their principal value.
- Floating-rate securities are securities whose interest payments change periodically according to a predetermined coupon formula.
- The coupon formula for a basic floater consists of two parts: a reference rate and a quoted margin.
- Inflation-adjusted securities adjust the payments (either coupon or principal) to investors for some measure of the country's rate of inflation.
- The U.S. inflation-linked securities are referred to as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS).
- Different designs can be used for inflation-adjusted securities.
- Given the reference rate, the design of an inflation-adjusted security can be such that over time, the principal and/or the coupon income are adjusted for inflation between the date of issuance and the payment date of a cash flow.
- A small part of the central government securities markets is exchange rate-linked government debt. The structure of this debt instrument is that the principal depends on the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and some other currency, typically that of the issuing country.
- The structure of the primary market for government bonds should accomplish five objectives: (1) ensure cost-effectiveness; (2) encourage participation from a wide range of investors, including foreign institutions; (3) maximize competition; (4) minimize placement risk; and (5) foster transparency.
- The three distribution methods used in the primary sovereign debt markets are (1) auctions; (2) syndications/underwriting; and (3) tap sales.
- For countries with well-developed markets, the primary distribution method is an auction.
- Many sovereigns use either a single-price auction or a multiple-price auction to distribute marketable securities at issue.
- A primary dealer is a designated intermediary who is obligated to be an active participant in both the primary and secondary markets.
- Secondary markets are where previously issued securities are traded among investors.
- The process of breaking apart coupon securities to create zero-coupon securities is called "stripping."
- The process of reassembling coupon securities from a portfolio of strips is called "reconstitution."
- Repurchase agreements (repos) are a primary source of financing for government securities dealers.
- Sovereign ratings are assessments by credit rating agencies of the relative likelihood that a borrower (i.e., a central government) will default on its obligations.
- Two sovereign debt ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies: a local currency debt rating and a foreign currency debt rating.
- The two general categories of risk analyzed by credit rating agencies when assigning ratings are economic risk and political risk.
