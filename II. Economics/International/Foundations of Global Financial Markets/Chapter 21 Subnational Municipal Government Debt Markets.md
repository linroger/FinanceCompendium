Subnational governments include states, regions, provinces, counties, and municipalities, as well as local utilities companies either owned or regulated by these entities. In the United States, the SEC has reported that there are about 44,000 state and local entities that issue securities. Dexia reports that the number of subnational governments in the European Union is 90,380, which included 89,149 municipalities, 981 entities referred to as "intermediary entities" (which includes departments and provinces), and 250 regions. For the 27 member countries in the European Union, $80\%$ of the 89,149 municipalities are located in five countries: France ($41\%$), Germany ($13\%$), Spain ($9\%$), Italy ($9\%$), and Czech Republic ($7\%$).

Subnational governments need to obtain proceeds to fulfill their delegated responsibilities. They traditionally derive their revenue from one or more of the following sources: (1) tax revenue (income taxes, property taxes, and sales taxes); (2) share of revenue from the central government; (3) fees and charges on local services provided; (4) asset sales; (5) investment income; and (6) grants from nongovernmental organizations.

To obtain the necessary funding to operate a subnational government, the revenue sources of funding are combined with some debt arrangement (bank borrowing or the issuance of bonds). With the rapid industrialization and urbanization in developing countries has come the need for funding large-scale investments in infrastructure. For developed countries, the aging of its infrastructure will require a substantial commitment of capital. Although in both developed and developing economies, some financing will come from central governments and multilateral financial institutions, the rest must come from the subnationals themselves and any debt funding that they can obtain. Estimates for what the global need will be for infrastructure financing is provided by McKinsey, a consulting firm. McKinsey estimates that between 2012 and 2030, $57$ trillion will be needed globally for infrastructure. For this reason, central governments in many countries are seeking ways to improve their municipal debt market.

In this chapter, we describe the issues concerning the development of subnational or municipal debt markets, including the two types of models for obtaining debt. These structures include the bank lending model and the bond issuance model. The first model mentioned has severe limitations, and therefore the major push in many countries is to develop the municipal bond market. Because the U.S. municipal bond market is an example of a well-developed bond issuance market, we describe this market in considerable detail in this chapter.

## Central Government Control of Municipal Borrowing

A key issue that arises regarding the raising of funds in the financial markets by subnational governments is whether central governments should regulate subnational borrowing. The argument has been made that such regulation is unnecessary, because investors in financial markets will discipline subnational borrowing. Excessive borrowing as perceived by market participants would be discouraged as borrowing costs rise. Bank borrowing would become too expensive.

This view, however, is based on assumptions that if not true would require central government control over subnational borrowers. The assumptions include (1) lenders have sufficient information about the subnationalals that they are providing funding for; (2) local governments respond in an appropriate manner to private market signals, thus avoiding being shut out of the credit market; and (3) lenders believe that there will be a central government bailout should the subnational default. Given that it is not likely that these assumptions will hold in real world markets, it is argued that the development of a credit market for subnationalals would benefit from some central government regulations and control.[2]

## Structure of a Municipal Credit Market

Central governments have two models from which to develop their subnational debt markets. The first is via bank lending, and the second is the issuance of municipal bonds. Bank lending to subnationalals is the primary source for funding subnationalals today in Europe and Asia, but in North America, the primary source is municipal bonds. Of course, a hybrid of the two can be used.

## Bank Lending Model

Some banks specialize in lending to subnationalals. The largest one is Credit Local de France, which is now part of the Dexia Group. These banks have offered loans for investment projects of from 15 to 30 years. Municipal banks seek to establish a permanent partnership with subnationalals. The typical services that they provide to supplement their lending include preparing and structuring budgets, planning and designing investment projects that a subnational is considering financing, managing the subnational's finances, and serving as an intermediary between the subnational and central government in matters related to tax-sharing arrangements and grant allocations.

Municipal banks often are granted certain advantages in performing their role of providing loans for subnationalals. The banks in some countries are given a legal monopoly for lending to subnationalals. Municipal banks have access to some form of below-market interest rate funds not available to other types of banks. Municipal banks often benefit from laws that require that municipalities deposit accounts with them. The interest paid on those deposits is a below-market interest rate.

The environment has been changing for municipal banks due to financial sector deregulation. Legal monopolies are disappearing, forcing municipal banks to compete with other financial institutions to borrow funds. As a result of financial sector deregulation, municipal banks have lost access to below-market interest rates, again requiring that they complete with financial institutions (in particular, commercial banks). The type of relationship banking that existed when municipal banks dominated has disappeared, and subnationalals now must compete with corporate and consumer borrowers for available funding. Commercial banks traditionally have been less likely sources for funding long-term infrastructure projects. For this reason, central governments have fostered the development of a municipal bond market.

## Bond Issuance Model

Raising funds via the issuance of bonds is quite a different avenue for fund raising than is borrowing from municipal banks. Although investment bankers do seek to establish long-term relationships with a subnational, each time a subnational comes to market with a bond offering, competition among investment bankers dictates who would be the underwriter of that issue. This type of competition, particularly for subnationals who frequently come to market with a bond offering, is likely to result in a lower funding cost.

For small subnationalists that do not come to market frequently, the lower-cost funds may not be realized. This can be partially overcome by bond banks that are quasi-government entities. These banks purchase bonds from smaller subnationalals that are infrequent issuers in the bond market, pool the bonds to create another bond issue backed by the pooled bonds, and resell them to the public. Because the pooled bonds can be issued at a higher credit rating than that of the bonds issued by individual subnationalals, the interest rate that must be paid on pooled bonds will be less than what must be paid for individual subnationalals. The benefits of the lower cost can be passed through to the individual subnationalals. In the United States, examples of bond banks are the Maine Municipal Bond Bank and the Indiana Bond Bank, both established by their respective states.

The development of the municipal bond market in any country requires the introduction of credit ratings by credit rating agencies (CRAs), the entities that were the subject of chapter 5. As explained later in this chapter, CRAs evaluate various factors pertaining to the entity that they are rating. One of the major factors is the entity's financial condition. A rating will not be assigned if reliable financial information is not available. In the case of rating the bond of a subnational, CRAs need information about its local budget, all financial obligations outstanding, and its arrangements with the central government. These ratings are necessary for certain investors in the country to purchase the subnational bond and, in many countries, a minimum rating is needed before the central government will permit the subnational to issue the bond. Recall from our discussion of CRAs in chapter 5 that because the rating is an issuer-pay model, there is concern that CRAs may give in to economic pressure to give the rating necessary for the subnational to obtain approval from the central government.

The U.S. municipal bond market is the model that has proved to be highly successful in facilitating funding for states, counties, and townships. Later in this chapter, we focus on the U.S. municipal bond market, which is a highly successful municipal debt market.

## Multilateral Financial Institution Arrangements

Multilateral financial institutions, which are also referred to as supranationals, include the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Global

Environmental Fund. It has been argued that the greatest need for infrastructure financing in developing markets is Asia because of its rate of urbanization. The Asian Development Bank estimated that \$8 trillion worth of infrastructure projects would be needed in Asia simply to maintain the region's economic growth rates. Recognizing this growing need for infrastructure financing, in 2015 China led the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. This bank has 57 founding member countries that committed \$100 billion in capital to fund infrastructure projects in the region. China contributed \$30 million. Japan has committed to inject a significant amount.

The experience of multilateral institutions in fostering the development of a sustainable bond municipal debt market is sort of a puzzle. Take the case of Brazil, which has used loans from multilateral institutions for more than 30 years to develop a municipal debt market. Despite the many successes of this type of financing in terms of low rates of nonperforming municipal loans and investment projects that have been successful, market observers believe that Brazil "is as far away as ever from having a functioning local credit market."4 Brazil's subnationalals are not allowed to issue bonds, and because private banks view lending to subnationalals as too risky, they do not make intermediate- and long-term loans. To obtain any other type of borrowing, central government approval is required on a case-by-case basis.

To foster infrastructure financing in developing economies, multilateral institutions use public-private partnerships and project finance initiatives, which we discuss next.

## Infrastructure Financing via Project Finance and Public-Private Partnerships

The substantial worldwide need for financing infrastructure projects and the constraints on the budgets of subnationalals has resulted in some countries turning to the private sector. This is done by either a public-private partnership or direct financing of projects (referred to as project finance initiatives). These alternative funding arrangements are attractive, because they typically do not appear as part of a subnational's budget. For this reason, they are referred to as "off-budget" mechanisms.

A public-private partnership (PPP) is an agreement between a public agency or government department and a private sector entity (or entities) that calls for the procurement, building, or development of a facility or service and that shares risks and rewards between the public and private sector partners. This is very often in the form of a concession agreement, which is a contract between a private sector entity and a government entity to operate a specific service within that government entity's jurisdiction, subject to certain restrictions. However, this may sometimes take the form of a privately funded project known as a private finance initiative (PFI).[6]

The key distinction between a PPP and a PFI is that a PPP describes the overarching approach used to assist in more efficient procurement or management of projects that may be only partly privatized. Consequently, some or all of the ownership of the project remains in the hands of the government entity that has partnered with the private sector entity, and the project is set up to operate the facilities through a concession agreement. In contrast, PFIs include fund raising for the project and usually a shift in ownership—even if only during the lifetime of the finance—to the private sector. Despite this distinction, sometimes the terms PPP and PFI are used interchangeably.

Although there are many reasons for a subnational using PPP and PFI to finance infrastructure projects, one of the major ones is that these arrangements will lower interest cost compared with the same project financed through the public sector.

The largest PPP in the United States is the \$4 billion LaGuardia Airport Terminal B redevelopment project in New York. The partnership is between the LaGuardia Gateway Partners, and the subnational entity is the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The purpose of the PPP is to build a new state-of-the-art 1.3 million square foot LaGuardia Airport Central Terminal B and manage the terminal operations to better meet the needs of the 15 million passengers who use the terminal each year and the four airlines who use the terminal as their home (American Airlines, United, Southwest, and Air Canada). The LaGuardia Gateway Partners include

Vantage Airport Group, Skanska, Meridiam, and JLC Infrastructure, which are responsible for the development of the terminal and providing the equity investment. Vantage Airport Group is responsible for managing the terminal's operations.

## Municipal Green Bond Issuance

Green bonds are issued by supranationals, development banks, governments, and corporations. The largest issuers are the European Investment Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the African Development Bank, and the International Finance Corporation.

A "green project" refers to a project or activity that promotes climate or other environmental sustainability goals. Green bonds are financial instruments whose proceeds are used solely to finance new and existing green projects. The catalysts for the introduction and growth of the green bond market are the World Bank Group and the European Development Bank. The World Bank has issued green bonds since 2008; through mid-2013, it had 67 transactions in 17 currencies totaling more than \$6.4 billion. In 2014, a local government agency in Norway, Kommunalbanken AS, issued a \$550 million green bond.

The bonds are issued in response to specific investor demand for a triple-A-rated product that supports projects to mitigate climate change or to help those people affected by climate change adapt to it. The first green bond investors were a group of Scandinavian pension funds seeking "investment opportunities for the fixed income portion of their portfolios that would help them support climate mitigation and adaptation projects."10

Voluntary transparency and disclosure guidelines, referred to as the Green Bond Principles, have been formulated for the purpose of promoting the integrity and development of the green bond market.[11] The broad categories of potentially eligible green projects to which the bond proceeds can be applied, as suggested by the Green Bond Principles, include (but are not limited to) renewable energy, energy efficiency (including energy-efficient buildings), sustainable waste management, sustainable land use (including sustainable forestry and agriculture), biodiversity conservation, clean transportation, and clean water or drinking water. Green bonds are classified, mostly by intended use, into four types: green proceeds bonds, green revenue bonds, green project bonds, and green securitized bonds.[12]

## U.S. Municipal Securities Market

U.S. municipal securities are issued by state and local governments and by the entities that they establish. All states issue municipal securities. Local governments include cities and counties. Political subdivisions of municipalities that issue securities include school districts and special districts for fire prevention, water, sewer, and other purposes. Public agencies or instrumentalities include authorities and commissions.

Municipal bonds are issued for various purposes. Short-term notes typically are sold in anticipation of the receipt of funds from taxes or proceeds from the sale of a bond issue, for example. The proceeds from the sale of short-term notes permit the issuing municipality to cover seasonal and temporary imbalances between outlays for expenditures and tax inflows. Municipalities issue long-term bonds as the principal means for financing both (1) long-term capital projects (such as the construction of schools, bridges, roads, and airports) and (2) long-term budget deficits that arise from current operations.

The municipal bond market includes two sectors: the tax-exempt bond sector and the taxable bond sector. The attractiveness of tax-exempt municipal securities is due to their tax treatment at the federal income tax level. Most municipal securities are tax exempt, which means that interest on the security is exempt from federal income taxation. The exemption applies to interest income, not capital gains. The exemption may or may not extend to the state and local levels. Each state has its own rules as to how interest on municipal securities is taxed.[13] The taxable municipal bond sector, by far the smaller sector, includes bonds whose interest is taxed at the federal income tax level.

Historically, investors in municipal securities have included retail investors, mutual funds, closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, bank trust departments, and property and casualty insurance companies. These investors are interested in the tax-exempt feature of municipal securities.

Retail investors either directly or indirectly through their ownership of collective investment vehicles (i.e., mutual funds, closed-end funds, or exchange-traded funds) own  $75\%$  of the municipal securities outstanding. More recently, hedge funds, arbitrageurs, life insurance companies, and foreign banks have become important participants. These investors are not interested in the tax-exempt feature. Instead, their primary interest is in opportunities to benefit from leveraged strategies that seek to generate capital gains.

## Types and Features of Municipal Bonds

The two basic types of municipal security structures are tax-backed debt and revenue bonds. Other securities share characteristics of tax-backed debt and revenue bonds.[14]

Tax-backed debt: Debt issued by states, counties, special districts, cities, towns, and school districts and secured by some form of tax revenue is called tax-backed debt. This type of debt includes general obligation debt, appropriation-backed obligations, and debt obligations supported by public credit enhancement programs.

The broadest type of tax-backed debt is general obligation debt. The two types of general obligation pledges are unlimited and limited. An unlimited tax general obligation debt is the stronger form of general obligation pledge, because it is secured by the issuer's unlimited taxing power. Tax revenue sources include corporate and individual income taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes. Unlimited tax general obligation debt is said to be secured by the full faith and credit of the issuer. A limited tax general obligation debt is a limited tax pledge because of a statutory limit on the tax rates the issuer may levy to service the debt.

Certain general obligation bonds are secured not only by the issuer's general taxing powers to create revenues accumulated in a general fund but also by certain identified fees, grants, and special charges, which provide additional revenues from outside the general fund. Such bonds are considered to be double-barreled in security because of the dual nature of the revenue sources. For example, the debt obligations issued by special purpose service systems may be secured by a pledge of property taxes, a pledge of special fees/operating revenue from the service provided, or a pledge of both property taxes and special fees/operating revenues. In the last case, they are double barreled.

Agencies or authorities of several states issue bonds that carry a potential state liability for making up shortfalls in the issuing entity's obligation. This type of debt is called an appropriation-backed obligation. The appropriation of funds from the state's general tax revenue must be approved by the state legislature. However, the state's pledge is not binding. Debt obligations with this nonbinding pledge of tax revenue are called moral obligation bonds. Because a moral obligation bond requires legislative approval to appropriate the funds, it is classified as an appropriation-backed obligation. The purpose of the moral obligation pledge is to enhance the creditworthiness of the issuing entity. However, the investor must rely on the best efforts of the state to approve the appropriation. Another type of appropriation-backed obligation is lease-backed debt.

Even though a moral obligation is a form of credit enhancement provided by a state, it is not a legally enforceable or legally binding obligation of the state. Some entities issue debt that carries some form of public credit enhancement that is legally enforceable. This type of credit enhancement occurs when the state or a federal agency guarantees or takes on an obligation to automatically withhold and deploy state aid to pay any defaulted debt service by the issuing entity. Typically, the latter form of public credit enhancement is used for debt obligations of a state's school systems.

Revenue bonds: The second basic type of security structure is found in a revenue bond. Such bonds are issued for either project or enterprise financing where the bond issuers pledge to the bondholders the revenues generated by the operating projects financed. A feasibility study is performed before the endeavor is undertaken to determine whether it will be self-supporting.

Examples of revenue bonds include airport revenue bonds, college and university revenue bonds, hospital revenue bonds, single-family mortgage revenue bonds, multifamily revenue bonds, public power revenue bonds, resource recovery revenue bonds, seaport revenue bonds, sports complex and convention center revenue bonds, student loan revenue bonds, toll road and gas tax revenue bonds, and water revenue bonds.

Hybrid and special bond structures: Some municipal securities create special security structures that share characteristics of tax-backed debt and revenue bonds. They include insured bonds, prerefunded bonds, and structured/asset-based bonds.

Insured bonds, in addition to being secured by the issuer's revenue, are also backed by insurance policies written by commercial insurance companies. Insurance on a municipal bond is an agreement by an insurance company, referred to as a "monoline insurer," to pay the bondholder any bond principal or coupon interest due on a stated maturity date that is not paid by the bond issuer. Once issued, this municipal bond insurance usually extends for the term of the bond issue, and it cannot be canceled by the insurance company. Municipal bond insurance is just one form of credit enhancement used by municipal bond issuers, although the most commonly used form.

Because municipal bond insurance reduces credit risk for the investor, the marketability of certain municipal securities can be greatly expanded. Municipal securities that benefit most from the insurance would include lower-quality bonds; bonds issued by smaller governmental units not widely known in the financial community; bonds that have a sound, though complex and difficult-to-understand security structure; and bonds issued by infrequent local government borrowers who do not have a general market following among investors. Of course, a major factor for an issuer in obtaining bond insurance is that its creditworthiness without the insurance is substantially lower than what it would be with the insurance. That is, the interest cost savings are only of sufficient magnitude to offset the cost of the insurance premium when the underlying creditworthiness of the issuer is lower.

Municipal bond insurance was first introduced in 1971 and until 2008 was a common form of credit enhancement. From 2000 to 2007, more than half of municipal securities issues were insured bonds or had some other form of credit enhancement. As a result of the financial crisis that began in 2007 that resulted in substantial payouts for insured mortgage-backed securities (not municipal securities), the issuance of insured bonds fell dramatically as the credit ratings of the monoline insurers were downgraded. For a monoline insurer to insure a municipal bond so that it receives the highest investment-grade rating, triple A (AAA by S&P and Fitch; Aaa by Moody's), the insurer must have a triple A rating. Because they were all downgraded to below triple A, insured municipal securities ceased. The Bond Buyer reports that in 2005, $57\%$ municipal securities were insured, but in 2010 and 2011, that figure was only $5.2\%$ and $6.2\%$, respectively.[15] In fact, for the years 2009, 2010, and 2011, only $17\%$ of municipal securities had some form of private credit enhancement.[16] Although private credit enhancement has declined, public credit enhancement has increased.

Although originally issued as either revenue or general obligation bonds, municipalities are sometimes prerefunded and are called prerefunded municipal securities. (They are also called refunded bonds.) A prerefunding usually occurs when the original bonds are escrowed or collateralized by direct obligations guaranteed by the U.S. government. A portfolio of securities guaranteed by the U.S. government is placed in a trust. The portfolio is assembled so that the cash flows from the securities match the obligations that the issuer must pay. For example, suppose that a municipality has a $5\%$ \$100 million issue with 12 years remaining to maturity. The municipality's obligation is to make payments of \$2.5 million every 6 months for the next 12 years and \$100 million 12 years from now. If the issuer wants to prerefund this issue, it purchases a portfolio of U.S. government obligations with cash flows of \$2.5 million every 6 months for the next 12 years and \$100 million 12 years from now.

Once this portfolio of securities whose cash flows match those of the municipality's obligation is in place, the prerefunded bonds are no longer secured as either general obligation or revenue bonds. The bonds are now supported by cash flows from the portfolio or securities held in an escrow fund. Such bonds, if escrowed with securities guaranteed by the U.S.

government, have little, if any, credit risk. They are the safest municipal securities available.

The escrow fund for a prerefunded municipal bond can be structured so that the bonds to be refunded are to be called at the first possible call date or a subsequent call date established in the original bond indenture. Although prerefunded bonds are usually retired at their first or subsequent call date, some are structured to match the debt obligation to the maturity date. Such bonds are known as escrowed-to-maturity bonds.

Some state and local governments issue bonds where the debt service is paid from so-called dedicated revenues, such as sales taxes, tobacco settlement payments, fees, and penalty payments. These structures, referred to as asset-backed securities, will be discussed in chapter 27. Asset-backed securities are also referred to as dedicated revenue bonds and structured bonds.

## Municipal Notes

Municipal securities issued for periods of up to three years are considered to be short term in nature. They include tax anticipation notes, revenue anticipation notes, grant anticipation notes, bond anticipation notes, tax-exempt commercial paper, variable-rate demand obligations, and commercial paper/variable-rate demand obligations.

Tax anticipation notes (TANs), revenue anticipation notes (RANs), grant anticipation notes (GANs), and bond anticipation notes (BANs) are temporary borrowings by states, local governments, and special jurisdictions. Usually the notes are issued for a period of 12 months, although it is not uncommon for notes to be issued for periods as short as three months or as long as three years. TANs and RANs (also known as TRANs) are issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes or other expected revenues. The purpose of these borrowings is to even out irregular flows into the treasuries of the issuing entity. BANs are issued in anticipation of the sale of long-term bonds.

We will discuss commercial paper issued by corporations in chapter 25. Tax-exempt commercial paper is used by municipalities to raise funds on a short-term basis ranging from 1 to 270 days. The dealer sets interest rates for various maturity dates, and the investor then selects the desired date. Tax regulations restrict the issuance of tax-exempt commercial paper. Specifically, tax regulations limit the amount of new issuance of municipal obligations that is tax exempt. As a result, every maturity of a tax-exempt municipal issuance is considered a new debt issuance. Consequently, very limited issuance of tax-exempt commercial paper exists. Instead, issuers use one of the next two products to raise short-term funds.

Variable-rate demand obligations (VRDOs) are floating-rate obligations that have a nominal long-term maturity but have a coupon rate that is reset either daily or every 7 days. The investor has an option to put the issue back to the trustee at any time with 7 days' notice. The put price is par plus accrued interest.

The commercial paper/VRDO hybrid is customized to meet the cash flow needs of an institutional investor. As with tax-exempt commercial paper, the maturity is flexibly structured, because the remarketing agent establishes interest rates for a range of maturities. Although the instrument may have a long nominal maturity, there is a put provision, as with a VRDO. Put periods can range from one day to more than 360 days. On the put date, the investor can put back the bonds, receiving principal and interest, or the investor can elect to extend the maturity at the new interest rate and put date posted by the remarketing agent at that time. Thus, the investor has two choices when initially purchasing this instrument: the interest rate and the put date.

## Default Risk

Investors in municipal securities are exposed to default risk—the risk that the issuer fails to meet its contractual obligations. Default rates are less than for corporate bonds of the same maturity and with the same initial credit rating. For example, a study by Moody's of default rates through 2012 found that the cumulative default rate after 10 years for municipal and corporate bonds was as follows:[17]

| Initial Rating | Municipal Securities (%) | Corporate Bonds (%) |
| :------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------ |
| AAA            | 0.00                     | 0.50                |
| AA             | 0.01                     | 0.92                |
| A              | 0.05                     | 2.48                |
| BBB            | 0.30                     | 4.74                |

Moody's also looked at the default rate by the different sectors of the municipal market from 1970 to 2012. General obligations had lower default rates than did revenue bonds. The default rate was about $7\%$. The revenue bond that had the highest default rate was the housing sector with a default rate of $40\%$, followed by the hospital and health care sector with a $30\%$ default rate.

As will be explained in chapter 26, default rates alone do not indicate a debt obligation's default risk. Moody's reported that for 1970-2012, the ultimate recovery for municipal securities averaged about $62\%$. In the case of senior unsecured corporate bonds (which provide a better comparison than all corporate bonds), the ultimate recovery rate was much lower ($49\%$) for 1987-2012. The range of recovery rates for municipal securities was from $2\%$ to $100\%$.

Spiotto provides a history of municipal bond defaults as well as the causes and nature of defaults.[18] These include:

- Economic conditions: Defaults are caused by downturns in the economy and high interest rates.
- Nonessential services: Revenue bonds were issued for services that are no longer needed.
- Feasibility of projects and industries: Revenue bonds are issued after a feasibility study for a project is completed. The feasibility study may have been too optimistic with respect to the demand for the project or the cost of completing the project.
- Fraud: Municipal officials fail to comply with the terms of the relevant documents.
- Mismanagement: A municipality is unable to successfully manage a project.
- Unwillingness to pay: A municipality may simply be unwilling to pay (i.e., repudiation of the debt obligation).
- Natural disasters: The impairment of a municipality's budget (reduction in revenue and increase in costs) may be the result of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane.

Bear in mind that a default does not mean a municipal bankruptcy, nor does a bankruptcy mean a default. That is, a municipality can default on an issue but the default may not result in a bankruptcy filing; a municipal bankruptcy filing may not result in a default of the municipality on its debt. In fact, historically, very few municipalities that have filed for bankruptcy have actually defaulted.

Many institutional investors in the municipal bond market rely on their own in-house municipal credit analysts for determining the creditworthiness of a municipal issue; other investors rely on the CRAs. The assigned rating system is the same as that used for corporate bonds that we will discuss in chapter 26. The credit rating for the central government acts as a ceiling for the rating on the credit rating of its subnationalals. Although it is not unprecedented, it is rare to see a subnational with a higher rating than its sovereign.

To evaluate general obligation bonds, the CRAs assess information in four basic categories. The first category includes information on the issuer's debt structure and overall debt burden. The second category relates to the issuer's ability and political discipline to maintain sound budgetary policy. The focus of attention here usually is on the issuer's general operating funds and whether it has maintained balanced budgets over three to five years. The third category involves determining the specific local taxes and intergovernmental revenues available to the issuer, as well as obtaining historical information both on tax collection rates (which are important when looking at property tax levies) and the dependence of local budgets on specific revenue sources. The fourth and last category of information necessary for the credit analysis is an assessment of the issuer's overall socioeconomic environment. The determinants for this category include trends in local employment distribution and composition, population growth, real estate property valuation, and personal income, among other economic factors.

Although numerous security structures can be used for revenue bonds, the underlying principle for rating is whether the project being financed will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy the obligation due bondholders.

## Municipal bankruptcy

We have referred to municipal bankruptcy. The provision in the U.S. bankruptcy code dealing with bankruptcy protection for municipalities is Chapter 9. This provision is much like a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in that it provides for a reorganization plan. There is no equivalent for municipalities of what is provided for in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, which pertains to the liquidation of a corporation. This is because a municipality cannot be liquidated, because that would violate the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution granting states sovereignty over their internal affairs.[19] Effectively, Chapter 9 grants a municipality more power over its creditors than a corporation has over its creditors. A municipality's creditors cannot compel a municipality to liquidate its assets.

States are not permitted to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Hence only nonstate municipal entities (cities, counties, townships, school districts, public improvement districts, and authorities of revenue-producing entities) can file. This action is not a simple process, explaining why historically the number of municipal entities filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection is low. For example, according to data from the American Bankruptcy Institute,[20] for the period 1980 through the second quarter of 2011, there were only 159 filings. Chapter 11 bankruptcies for any single year are far greater than that.

Municipality entities must overcome a major obstacle to file for bankruptcy. Title 11 of Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code requires that the state in which the municipal is located must grant approval to that entity to file for bankruptcy protection. This allows individual states to assess the trade-off of the adverse economic impact of the municipal entity seeking to obtain bankruptcy protection against the needs of the municipality entities that need protection offered by a Chapter 9 filing. Twenty-two states do not allow municipal entities access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy, 16 states impose conditions that must be satisfied by a municipality to file, and the remaining 12 states provide blanket authorization to file.[21]

Because of the Tenth Amendment, a U.S. bankruptcy judge does not have the same power in a municipal bankruptcy as in a corporate bankruptcy. As a result, a U.S. bankruptcy judge is not as active in Chapter 9 bankruptcy filings as he or she is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After determination of whether a municipal entity is entitled by state law to file for bankruptcy, a bankruptcy judge is responsible for approving the plan for how the municipal entity is going to pay its creditors and ensuring that the municipal entity executes that plan.

As of 2017, the four largest municipal Chapter 9 bankruptcies are:

- City of Detroit, Michigan, filed in 2013 due to its inability to satisfy unfunded pension obligations: \$18 billion.
- Jefferson City, Alabama, filed in 2011 because of a failed investment strategy (bets on interest rate) leading to losses: \$4 billion.
- Orange County, California, filed in 1994 due to losses of more than \$1 billion on leveraged investments in exotic mortgage-backed security products: \$2 billion.
- Stockton, California, filed in 2012 due to difficulties satisfying pension obligations: \$1 billion.

## Secondary Market for Municipal Bonds

Municipal securities are traded in the OTC market supported by more than 1,500 municipal bond dealers. Markets for the debts of smaller issuers (referred to as local credits) are maintained by regional brokerage firms, local banks, and some of the larger Wall Street firms. Markets for the bonds of larger issuers (referred to as generic names) are supported by the larger brokerage firms and banks, many of whom have investment banking relationships with these issuers.

In the municipal bond market, an "odd lot" of bonds is  \$25,000 or less in par value for retail investors. For institutions, anything below \$100,000 in par value is considered an odd lot. Dealer spreads depend on several factors. For the retail investor, the spread can range from as low as 0.25 points ($12.50 per $5,000 par value) on large blocks of actively traded bonds to four points ($200 per $5,000 of par value) for odd-lot sales of an inactive issue. For institutional investors, the dealer spread rarely exceeds 0.5 points ($25 per $5,000 of par value). The convention for both corporate and Treasury bonds is to quote prices as a percentage of par value with 100 equal to par. However, municipal securities generally are traded and quoted in terms of yield (yield to maturity or yield to call). The price of the bond in this case is called a "basis price." The exception is certain long-maturity revenue bonds. A bond traded and quoted in dollar prices (actually, as a percentage of par value) is called a dollar bond.

As noted earlier, more than  $75\%$  of the outstanding principal amount of municipal securities is held directly or indirectly by retail (individual investors). Historically, the market has been viewed as one where investors tended to buy a municipal security and then hold it to maturity. Thus, after the initial sale of a municipal security, there is infrequent trading. However, a significant volume of secondary market trading does occur. According to trade data compiled by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), annual trading in municipal securities for the years 2010-2013 averaged 3.4 trillion in principal value; the average number of trades per year over the same period averaged 10.3 million.[22] The number of trades for revenue bonds during those years was approximately double the number for general obligation bonds. For the three years ending 2013, trading in tax-exempt bonds was almost 10 times greater than taxable bonds in terms of the number of trades.

Investors typically have limited access to pretrade information. Generally, municipal bond dealers do not make available firm bid and ask quotations available to the public. Pretrade information might be available to investors from alternative trading systems, such as electronic communication networks made available to municipal bond dealers. Trades are typically executed for customers on a principal basis (i.e., the municipal bond dealer buys and sells from its own inventory). For customer trades not executed in that way, the dealer will either search the OTC market to execute the trade or use an alternative trading system. In general, particularly for retail investors, the cost of transacting is higher than in other investment-grade bond markets due to the lack of market transparency.

Roughly $43\%$ of the trading in the municipal securities in 2012 and 2013 was executed through five bond dealers, according to data compiled by the MSRB.[23] Roughly two-thirds of all trades were executed by 20 bond dealers.

The SEC study of the municipal securities market made several recommendations for improving the secondary market and providing greater investor protection. The two major areas where improvements have been suggested are ongoing disclosure and improving market structure.

## Yields on Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds

Because of the tax-exempt feature of municipal securities, their yield is less than that on Treasuries with the same maturity. The difference in yield between tax-exempt securities and Treasury securities is typically measured not in basis points but in percentage terms. More specifically, it is measured as the percentage of the yield on a municipal security relative to a comparable Treasury security and is called the yield ratio. Historically, the yield ratio has varied not just by credit rating and maturity but over time. The range for the yield ratio has been from 0.80 to more than 1.0.

In the municipal bond market, several benchmark curves exist. In general, a benchmark yield curve is constructed for AAA-rated state general obligations. In the Treasury and corporate bond markets, it is not unusual to find at different times shapes for the yield curve described in chapter 16 (see figure 16.1). In general, the municipal yield curve is positively sloped.

Participants in the municipal securities market calculate a yield to approximate what yield would have to be earned on a taxable bond to net the same yield after taxes as buying a taxable bond. That yield is referred to as a taxable-equivalent yield. We described this yield measure and its calculation in chapter 16.

## Chinese Municipal Bond Market

The People's Republic of China is making a major push to create a sustainable municipal debt market that has relied on banks to provide infrastructure finance to bond issuance. For example, in 2011, three cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen) and the province of Zhejiang were allowed to issue bonds directly to the capital markets. These bonds are issued without a sovereign guarantee. On September 1, 2014, the Chinese parliament passed changes in the budget law that allows local governments to issue bonds directly. Local governments may issue bonds to fund projects that promote the public good (investments in infrastructure) but may not use borrowed money for day-to-day operations. In recent years, the Chinese government has made a major push to develop the country's municipal debt market. Prior to 2010, subnational government entities borrowed through the Urban Development and Investment Corporation, which is the investment and financing platform for subnationals in China. This corporation borrows directly from financial markets, and the subnational is responsible for servicing the debt.

Another important financing vehicle that has been used in China since the global financial crisis is the "local government-backed unit." These units are used to fund infrastructure projects. A local government-backed unit is a state-owned enterprise with a local government as the only shareholder. To create a unit, the local government transfers land, utilities, or infrastructure to the unit in exchange for equity ownership. Just like regular corporations, the local government-backed unit raises capital from bank loans or the sale of debt instruments. Local governments service the debt through the sale of land. They are not permitted to use tax revenue to fund the debt.[24]

## Key Points

- Subnational governments include states, regions, provinces, counties, municipalities, as well as local utilities companies either owned or regulated by these entities.
- To obtain the necessary funding to operate a subnational government, revenue sources of funding are combined with some debt arrangement (bank borrowing or the issuance of bonds).
- A major issue faced by subnationalals in developing and developed countries is how to obtain debt funding for large-scale investments in infrastructure.
- Although some financing for infrastructure comes from central governments and multilateral financial institutions, the rest must come from the subnationalists themselves and any debt funding that they can obtain; for this reason, central governments are seeking to strengthen the debt market for their subnationalists.
- Central governments have two models from which to develop their subnational debt markets: bank lending and bond issuance.
- Bank lending is via municipal banks that have been established in a country.
- The development of the municipal bond market in any country requires the introduction of credit ratings by credit rating agencies.
- For small subnationalists that are infrequent issuers of bonds, issuance is made possible through municipal bond banks.
- Multilateral financial institutions work with developing countries when seeking to create a sustainable municipal debt market.
- The substantial need for financing throughout the world for infrastructure projects and the constraints on the budgets of subnationalals have resulted in some countries turning to the private sector via public-private partnerships and project finance initiatives.
- Funding arrangements via public-private partnerships and project finance initiatives are attractive to subnationalists, because they typically do not appear as part of a subnational's budget.
- Green bonds are bonds whose proceeds are restricted to fund green projects, which are projects that promote climate or other environmental sustainability goals.
- In the United States, municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments and their authorities.
- Although there are both tax-exempt and taxable municipal bonds in the United States, most municipal securities are of the tax-exempt variety.
- The interest received from a tax-exempt municipal security is exempt from federal income taxation.
- Investors in municipal securities attracted by their tax advantage are retail investors, collective investment vehicles, and property and casualty insurance companies.
- Because of the tax-exempt feature of municipal securities, the yield on tax-exempt municipal securities is less than that on Treasuries with the same maturity.
- The yield ratio measures the yield on a municipal security relative to a comparable Treasury security.
- The two basic types of municipal bond structures are tax-backed debt and revenue bonds.
- Tax-backed debt obligations are instruments issued by states, counties, special districts, cities, towns, and school districts that are secured by some form of tax revenue.
- Tax-backed debt includes general obligation debt (the broadest type of tax-backed debt), appropriation-backed obligations, and debt obligations supported by public credit enhancement programs.
- A general obligation bond is said to be double-barreled when it is secured not only by the issuer's general taxing powers to create revenues accumulated in a general fund but also by certain identified fees, grants, and special charges, which provide additional revenues from outside the general fund.
- Revenue bonds are issued for enterprise financings secured by the revenues generated by the completed projects themselves, or for general public-purpose financings in which the issuers pledge to the bondholders the tax and revenue resources that were previously part of the general fund.
- Prerefunded bonds are no longer secured as either general obligation or revenue bonds but are supported by a portfolio of securities held in an escrow fund. If escrowed with securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, prerefunded bonds are the safest municipal securities available.
- A prerefunded municipal bond is one in which the escrow fund is structured so that the bonds are to be called at the first possible call date or a subsequent call date established in the original bond indenture.
- Municipal securities structured as asset-backed securities are backed by "dedicated" revenues, such as sales taxes and tobacco settlement payments.
- Municipal notes are issued for shorter periods (one to three years) than are municipal securities.
- Investing in municipal securities exposes investors to credit risk and tax risk.
- Default rates are lower and recovery rates are higher for municipal securities compared to otherwise comparable corporate bonds.
- Historically, the causes and nature of defaults have been economic conditions, nonessential services, feasibility of projects and industries, fraud, mismanagement, unwillingness to pay, and natural disasters.
- To evaluate general obligation bonds, the credit rating agencies assess information in four basic categories: (1) issuer's debt structure and overall debt burden, (2) issuer's ability and political discipline to maintain sound budgetary policy, (3) issuer's access to specific local taxes and intergovernmental revenues, and (4) issuer's overall socioeconomic environment.
- The provision in the U.S. bankruptcy code dealing with bankruptcy protection for municipalities is Chapter 9 and provides for a reorganization plan.
