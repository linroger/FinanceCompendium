Equity securities represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Holders of equity securities are entitled to the earnings of the corporation when those earnings are distributed in the form of dividends. They are also entitled to a pro rata share of the remaining equity if a corporation is liquidated. The two types of equity securities are common stock and preferred stock. The key distinction between these two forms of equity securities lies in the degree to which they may participate in any distribution of earnings and capital and the priority given to each in the distribution of earnings. Typically, preferred stockholders are entitled to a fixed dividend, which they receive before common stockholders may receive dividends, and they also have priority over common stockholders in a claim on assets in a liquidation. We therefore refer to preferred stock as a senior corporate security.

In the secondary market for common stock, the opinions of investors about the economic prospect of a company are expressed through the trades they execute. Taken together, these trades establish the market consensus opinion about the price of the stock. In turn, the company's estimated cost of common stock is determined.

In this chapter and the two that follow, we cover the world's equity markets. In this chapter, our focus is on the venues for the secondary trading of equities in the United States. In chapter 23, we describe trading arrangements in the U.S. secondary market, explain the costs of transacting, and review the pricing efficiency of the equities market, along with its implications for equity strategies. In chapter 24, we examine global non-U.S. equity markets.

# Evolution of Stock Markets and Their Institutionalization

Stocks throughout the world have traditionally been transacted or traded on venues, or exchanges (bours), which are physical locations. The nature of stock exchanges, however, has changed considerably since 1980. Table 22.1 summarizes these major changes. (Many of the terms and entities listed in the table are described in this and later chapters.) The table shows the evolution of stock exchanges from a market that was characterized as single country, limited product, mutually owned, floor trading exchanges to international, multiproduct, publicly owned, electronic trading exchanges.

Four general interacting factors contributed to significant changes experienced by the equity markets throughout the world over the past 40 years:

1. institutionalization of the stock market as a result of a shift away from traditional small individual investors to large institutional investors;
2. change in trading from mutual member-owned floor trading exchanges to publicly owned computer-based trading exchanges together with automated trading systems;
3. automation of settlement systems; and
4. changes in government regulation of the market.

The institutionalization of the common stock market has important implications for the design of equity trading systems, because the demands made by institutional investors differ from those made by traditional small investors. Moreover, the role of the equity market in facilitating capital formation for public corporations means designing a market structure that considers not just large corporations but also small corporations and startup companies seeking to raise equity capital, a market sector that we describe in chapter 28.

The nature of equity trading is currently dominated by the use of computers to generate orders as a result of advances in computer technology, through what is referred to as algorithmic trading. Because of this dominance of computer trading, the equity market has been referred to as an algorithmic marketplace, in contradistinction to how equity markets previously operated, which is called a manual market. These topics are discussed throughout this chapter.

# Electronic Trading

Traditionally, equities have been traded globally on "exchanges," which are physical locations at which individual traders conduct transactions with one another. The nature of exchanges has changed considerably over the past few decades in the United States, as summarized in table 22.1. Globally, exchanges have followed similar trends. The current overall approach to equity trading, as summarized in figure 22.1, consists of a combination of exchange trading venues and off-exchange trading systems (called "alternative trading systems" (ATS)) of equities. Consider a recent advance in trading, called electronic trading.

Structure of U.S. stock markets.

Electronic trading is a method of trading securities whereby traders are brought together via electronic trading platforms or networks that create a "virtual marketplace," rather than via a physical trading floor. Electronic trading has to a large extent replaced "floor trading" and telephone trading, as discussed below, wherein traders are brought together physically on a trading floor or by telephone contact, respectively.

Now let us consider U.S. trading venues. Floor trading was used exclusively until recently by the major stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) described later in this chapter, and is now used only for a small portion of its trading. Nasdaq was formed in 1971 as the world's first electronic stock market.

Electronic trading provides several advantages over floor trading:

- Lower transaction costs: Automating the entire process (including trade processing, position keeping, clearing and settlement, referred to as "straight-through processing") has further reduced costs.
- Increased transparency: It is easier to track prices that are maintained in an electronic system.
- Increased liquidity: By more efficiently connecting all buyers and sellers, the market becomes more liquid.
- Smaller spreads: Automation has lowered costs, increased transparency, and increased liquidity, which results in smaller spreads.
- Expanded trading hours.

Later we will discuss trading venues in the United States. Of these trading venues, both the NYSE and Nasdaq use electronic trading. The NYSE is an auction market (discussed below), which has a specialist assigned to each stock, although independent floor traders do most of the trades. In addition, NYSE has an electronic Super Designated Order Turnaround system (SuperDOT system) for "small" trades of less than 100,000 shares (with priority given to trades of less than 2,100 shares) and transmits the orders (both market and limit) directly to the specialist for this stock. This system provides more efficient transactions, because the orders go directly to the specialist rather than to a floor trader and then to manually transaction. Executed orders are also reported to the broker through the SuperDOT system. The DOT and SuperDOT systems began in 1976. NYSE's recent Arca market, which is discussed below, is completely electronic.

# Regulation of U.S. Equity Markets

The regulation of the securities markets around the globe, including stock exchanges, has three primary objectives: (1) to protect investors, (2) to ensure the smooth functioning of the market, and (3) to reduce systemic risk.

To protect investors, regulation must address informational asymmetries between the issuers of securities and investors. This can be achieved through disclosure regulation. The equities markets in most countries are highly regulated to ensure that investors are protected against fraudulent practices that might be followed by corporations when issuing stock or by brokers and dealers when executing transaction orders by investors. The smooth functioning of the market requires trading and settlement rules to minimize the risk of market disruptions. Systemic risk has been discussed in chapter 10 and touched on in several other chapters in this book.

In the United States, there are three types of regulations: federal regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, regulation by a self-regulatory organization (the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority), and regulation by state regulators. Here we briefly describe each type.

Securities and Exchange Commission The primary regulator of U.S. securities markets is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Two important pieces of legislation were passed by Congress following the stock market crash of October 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. The first was the Securities Act of 1933, which required that investors receive financial information—in the form of a "prospectus"—before going public (the primary market for securities). The second was the Securities Act of 1934, which created the SEC, whose goal was to protect investors and maintain the fair and orderly functioning of the securities markets. Among the SEC's responsibilities are to promote full public disclosure and to protect investors from fraudulent and manipulative markets. Briefly, the Securities Act of 1933 covered the primary markets, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 covered the secondary markets for U.S. securities.

The purpose of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was to restore the confidence of investors in the stock market. The two ways that Congress sought to do so were by specifying: (1) the information (as well as the timing of that information) that companies offering securities to the public must furnish to investors (the primary markets); and (2) the practices that brokers, dealers, and trading venues must follow when executing orders on behalf of investors (the secondary markets).

The five general areas where the SEC has responsibility are:

- interpreting and enforcing federal securities laws passed by Congress;
- issuing new rules and amending of existing rules;
- overseeing and monitoring the major players in the securities markets (i.e., securities firms, brokers, investment advisers, and ratings agencies);
- overseeing private self-regulatory organizations in the securities, accounting, and auditing fields; and
- coordinating U.S. securities regulation with other federal entities (e.g., Congress, the Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve), state regulators, and foreign authorities.

To carry out its responsibilities, the SEC relies on its five divisions:

- Division of Corporation Finance: Executing the SEC's duty for overseeing corporate disclosure of important information to investors when securities are publicly offered is this division's responsibility.
- Division of Trading and Markets: This division is responsible for executing the SEC's duty to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.
- Division of Investment Management: The responsibility of this division is to provide investor protection and promote capital formation by using its oversight and regulatory authority over the investment management industry.
- Division of Enforcement: This division is responsible for law enforcement function by recommending investigations of securities law violations, recommending the SEC bring civil actions in federal court or an administrative proceeding before an administrative law judge, and prosecuting these cases.
- Division of Economic and Risk Analysis: This division provides sophisticated and data-driven economic and risk analyses to inform the SEC in its policymaking, rulemaking, enforcement, and examinations.

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is an independent, not-for-profit organization authorized by Congress with a dual mission objective: to protect investors and to foster market integrity. FINRA is referred to as a self-regulatory organization. Created in 2007 when the National Association of Securities Dealers merged with the regulatory functions of the NYSE, FINRA writes and enforces rules governing the activities of securities firms, examines securities firms for compliance with those rules, and fosters market transparency.

To accomplish its dual mission, FINRA does the following:2

1. Deters misconduct by enforcing the rules. To safeguard investors against fraud and bad practices, FINRA writes and enforces rules and regulations for all U.S. brokerage firms and brokers, and it examines broker-dealers for compliance with its own rules and also with federal securities laws and rules. FINRA licenses all brokers. FINRA financial examiners perform on-site examinations to assess how brokerage firms are operating, focusing on major risks to the markets and investors.
2. Disciplines those who break the rules. If brokers fail to comply with the rules, FINRA may impose a fine or penalty, suspend a violator from the industry for a specified period of time, or bar a violator from the industry.
3. **Detects and prevents wrongdoing.** FINRA monitors trades in the U.S. listed equity market (about six billion shares traded) using data-gathering and analysis technology that has the capability of detecting potential abuses.
4. Educates and informs investors. The FINRA website provides investors with tools and resources that can aid them when making investment decisions.
5. Resolves securities disputes. Through arbitration and mediation, FINRA resolves securities-related disputes that arise between investors and securities firms or individual brokers.

State regulation In addition to federal securities laws, there are state securities laws. The focus of state laws, referred to as "blue sky laws," is on the issuance of securities and periodic disclosure, as opposed to market regulation. Each state has a regulatory agency responsible for regulating the sale of securities in the state. Every state is a member of the North American Securities Administrators Association, which, although lacking the authority to enforce laws, formulates and recommends model securities laws. What most states use as the basis for their securities laws is the

Uniform Securities Act of 1956. Because this act is written broadly, and because the laws may vary from state to state, state securities laws will not be discussed here.

# Stock Trading Market Structures

An exchange is often defined as a market where intermediaries meet to deliver and execute customer orders. This description, however, also applies to many dealer networks. In the United States, an exchange is an institution that performs this function and is registered with the SEC as an exchange. Some off-exchange markets also perform this function.

There are two overall market models for trading stocks. The first model is order driven, in which buy and sell orders of those public participants who are the holders of the securities establish the prices at which other public participants can trade. These orders can be either market orders or limit orders, which we describe in chapter 23. The second model is quote driven, in which intermediaries (i.e., market makers or dealers) quote the prices at which the public participants trade. Market makers provide a bid quote (to buy) and an offer quote (to sell), and they realize revenues from the spread between these quotes. Thus, market makers derive a profit from the spread and the turnover of their stocks.

# Order-Driven Markets

Participants in a pure order-driven market are referred to as "naturals" (the natural buyers and sellers). No intermediary participates as a trader in a pure order-driven market. Instead, the investors supply the liquidity themselves. That is, the natural buyers are the source of liquidity for the natural sellers, and vice versa. The naturals can be either buyers or sellers, each using market or limit orders.

Order-driven markets can be structured in two different ways: as a continuous market or as a call auction at a specific point of time. In a continuous market, a trade can be made at any moment in continuous time during which a buy order and a sell order meet at a specific time. In this case, trading is a series of bilateral matches. In the call auction, orders are batched together for a simultaneous execution in a multilateral trade at a specific point in time. All buy orders at this price and higher and all sell orders at this price and lower are executed.

Continuous trading is better for customers who need immediacy. However, for markets with very low trading volume, an intraday call may focus liquidity at one (or a few) times of the day and permit the trades to occur. In addition, very large orders—block trades—may be facilitated by the feasibility of continuous trading.

Nonintermediated markets involve only naturals; that is, such markets do not require a third party. However, a market may not have sufficient liquidity to function without the participation of intermediaries, who are third parties in addition to the natural buyers and sellers. This leads to the need for intermediaries and quote-driven markets.

Quote-Driven Markets

Quote-driven markets permit intermediaries to provide liquidity. Intermediaries may be brokers (who are agents for the naturals); dealers or market makers (who are principals in the trade); or specialists, as on the NYSE (who act as both agents and principals). Dealers are independent, profit-making participants in the process. Dealers operate as principals, not agents. Dealers continually provide bid and offer quotes to buy for or sell from their own accounts and profit from the spread between their bid and offer quotes.

Dealers compete with one another in their bids and offers. Obviously, from the customer's perspective, the "best" market is the highest bid and lowest offer among the dealers. This highest bid/lowest offer combination is referred to as the "inside market" or the "top of the book." For example, assume that dealers A, B, and C have the bids and offers (also called asking prices) for hypothetical stock Alpha as shown in table 22.2.

Table 22.2 Quote-driven/dealer market.

<table><tr><td colspan="5">Stock Alpha</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Bids</td><td colspan="3">Offers</td></tr><tr><td>Dealer</td><td>Bid ($)</td><td>Dealer</td><td>Offer ($)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>40.50</td><td>C</td><td>41.00</td><td>Top of the Book:</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>40.35</td><td>B</td><td>41.10</td><td>40.50 (A) / 41.00 (C)</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>40.20</td><td>A</td><td>41.20</td><td></td></tr></table>

The best (highest) bid is by dealer A of \$40.50; the best (lowest) offer is by dealer C of \$41.00. Thus, the inside market is the \$40.50 bid (by A) and \$41.00 offer (by C). Note that A's spread is \$40.50 bid and \$41.20 offer for a spread (or profit margin) of 0.70. A has the highest bid but not the lowest offer. C has the lowest offer but not the highest bid. B has neither the highest bid nor the lowest offer. For a stock in the U.S. market, the highest bid and lowest offer across all markets is called the national best bid and offer (NBBO).

Dealers add value to the transaction process by providing capital for trading and facilitating order handling. With respect to providing capital for trading, they buy and sell for their own accounts at their bid and offer prices, respectively, thereby providing liquidity. With respect to order handling, they provide value in two ways. First, they assist in the price improvement of customer orders; that is, the order is executed within the bid/offer spread. Second, they facilitate the market timing of customer orders to achieve price discovery. Price discovery is a dynamic process that involves customer orders being translated into trades and transaction prices. Because price discovery is not instantaneous, individual participants have an incentive to "market-time" the placement of their orders. Intermediaries may understand the order flow and may assist the customer in this regard. The intermediary may be a person or an electronic system.

The over-the-counter (OTC) markets are quote-driven markets. The OTC markets began during a time when stock quotes were passed over the counter. A customer may choose to buy from or sell to a specific market maker to whom they wish to direct an order. Directing an order to a specific market is referred to as "preferencing."

Overall, nonintermediated, order-driven markets may be less costly due to the absence of profit-seeking dealers. But the markets for many stocks are not inherently sufficiently liquid to operate in this way. For this reason, intermediated, dealer markets are often necessary for inherently less liquid markets. The dealers provide dealer capital, participate in price discovery, and facilitate market timing.

Because of the different advantages of these two approaches, many equity markets are now hybrid markets. For example, the NYSE is primarily a continuous auction order-driven system based on customer orders, but the specialists enhance the liquidity by their market making to maintain a fair and orderly market, and market makers also enhance liquidity. Overall, the NYSE is primarily an auction, order-driven market that has specialists (who often engage in market making), other floor traders, call markets at the open and close, and upstairs dealers who provide proprietary capital to facilitate block transactions. Thus, the NYSE is a hybrid combination of these two models. Another hybrid aspect of the NYSE is that it opens and closes trading with a call auction. The continuous market and call auction market are combined. Thus, the NYSE is a continuous market during the trading day and a call auction market to open and close the market and to reopen after a stop in trading.

Nasdaq, which we describe later in this chapter, began as a descendant of the OTC dealer network and is a dealer quote-driven market. It remains primarily a quote-driven market but has added some order-driven aspects, such as its limit order book, called SuperMontage, which made it a hybrid market.

Figure 22.1 provides an overview of the non-intermediated, auction, order-driven markets and the intermediated, dealer, quote-driven markets in the United States.

Another structural change that has occurred in exchanges is their evolution from membership-owned, floor-traded organizations to publicly owned, electronically traded (that is, no trading floor) organizations. The nature of this evolution (or revolution) was discussed earlier.

# U.S. Equity Trading Venues

Broadly speaking, equity trading in the United States occurs mainly through either: (1) national securities exchanges or (2) alternative trading systems. These methods are summarized in figure 22.2. Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a securities exchange must be registered with the SEC under Section 6 of the Act. An alternative trading system (ATS), also referred to as an off-exchange trading venue, involves the trading of stocks off an exchange which are listed on an exchange, or for the trading of stocks in the after-hours market (when the national exchanges are closed). Under U.S. securities law, an ATS is given the option to register as a registered exchange or as a broker-dealer. For this reason, an ATS can also be classified as a registered securities exchange if it elects to register with the SEC as such.

Figure 22.2

U.S. equity trading venues.

In the United States, there are 14 SEC registered securities that trade equities. As explained below, some of the SEC registered exchanges are in fact ATSs that elected to be registered and regulated as national securities exchanges.

When discussing the different types of venues for trading, it is useful to think of the classification of traded stocks in terms of their listing on an exchange. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 defines two categories of traded stocks. The first is exchange-traded stocks, also called "listed" stocks. The second is what is called OTC stocks, or non-exchange-traded stocks and thus, by inference, "unlisted." We will therefore refer to non-ATS venues as exchanges for trading listed stocks or exchanges for trading unlisted stocks. There is some overlap (and ambiguity) in the use of trading of listed and OTC stocks and the trading of these on exchanges and ATS. Although this is helpful for classifying non-ATS exchanges, it should be pointed out that there are requirements for stocks to be traded on exchanges for unlisted stocks.

Information provided by trading venues is important for market transparency. Pre-trade transparency is the disclosure by the trading venue of a stock's supply and demand as measured in terms of bid-ask prices. That information, provided in what is called the order book, indicates the liquidity and depth of the market for that stock. Post-trade transparency is the disclosure of trades that have been executed on the trading venue.

Transparency is provided by reporting on the Consolidated Quote System and Consolidated Tape System (CTS). Pre-trade transparency is provided by the display of the stock's national best bid and offer (NBBO) on the Consolidated Quote System. The CTS provides post-trade transparency by providing post-trade data, which include the transaction prices and the quantities traded. These topics are considered further below.

# Exchange Markets for Listed Stocks

Traditionally, exchange markets have been physical locations that are populated by "members" that use the exchange facilities and systems to exchange or trade listed stocks. Stocks traded on an exchange are said to be listed stocks. To be listed, a company must apply and satisfy requirements established by the exchange for minimum capitalization, shareholder equity, average closing share price, and other criteria. Even after being listed, exchanges may delist a company's stock if it no longer meets the exchange requirements.

Some stocks are traded on regional as well as national stock exchanges. Two kinds of stocks are listed on a regional stock exchange: (1) stocks of companies that either could not qualify for listing on one of the major national exchanges or could qualify for listing but chose not to list there; and (2) stocks, known as dually listed stocks, that are also listed on a major national exchange. A company may be motivated to dual list, for example, if a local brokerage firm that purchases a membership on a regional exchange can trade the company's listed stocks without having to purchase a considerably more expensive membership on the national stock exchange where the stock is also listed. Alternatively, a local brokerage firm could use the services of a member of a major national stock exchange to execute an order, but it then gives up part of its commission. The regional stock exchanges compete with the major national exchanges for the execution of smaller trades. Major national brokerage firms route such orders to regional exchanges because of the lower cost they charge for executing orders or better prices.

New York Stock Exchange The major exchange that trades its own listed stocks is the traditional NYSE. A more recent electronic version of the NYSE stock exchange, NYSE Arca, is discussed below. Members trade stocks listed on the traditional NYSE in a centralized continuous auction market at a designated location on the trading floor, called a "post," with brokers representing their customers' buy and sell orders. A single specialist is the market maker for each stock. A member firm may be designated as a specialist for the common stock of more than one company, that is, several stocks can trade at the same post. But only one specialist is designated for the common stock of each listed company.

Prior to 2006, the NYSE was a pure continuous-order market. Such a market is also called a "continuous market" or "continuous auction market." In this type of order-driven market, prices are determined continuously throughout the trading day as buyers and sellers submit orders. The other type of market structure is the order-driven market, characterized by a periodic call auction, or an auction market, in which orders are batched or grouped together for simultaneous execution at preannounced times. Today, the NYSE uses both types of market structures, continuous auction and call auction. More specifically, the NYSE is a continuous auction market during the trading day and a call auction market to open and close the market (as well as to restart trading if a stock has stopped trading). Hence the NYSE can be described as a hybrid market.

A specialist for each stock stands at a trading position around one of the NYSE posts. Each post is essentially an auction site where orders, bids, and offers arrive. In addition to the single specialist market maker on an exchange, member firms of an exchange can trade for themselves or on behalf of their customers. NYSE member firms, which are broker-dealer organizations that serve the investing public, employ brokers on the trading floor who serve as fiduciaries in the execution of customer orders.

Specialists are required to conduct the auction process and maintain an orderly market in one or more designated stocks. Specialists may act as both a broker (agent) and a dealer (principal). In their role as a broker, or agent, specialists transact customer orders in their assigned stocks, which arrive at their post electronically or are entrusted to them by a floor broker to be executed if and when a stock reaches a price specified by a customer (i.e., a limit or stop order, as discussed in chapter 23). As a dealer or principal, specialists buy and sell shares in their assigned stocks for their own account as necessary to maintain an orderly market. Specialists must always give precedence to public orders over trading for their own account.

Certain types of orders not immediately executed on the trading floor are known as limit orders and stop orders (which are discussed in chapter 23). If the order is a limit or stop order, the member firm's floor broker can wait in the trading crowd or give the order to the specialist in the stock, who enters the order in that specialist's limit order book (or simply the "book") for later execution based on the relationship between the market price and the price specified in the limit or stop order. The book lists the limit and stop orders, arranged by size and nearness to the current market price. The book used to be an actual physical paper book but is now maintained electronically. Traders can see the total limit-order volume at every bid and offer price, allowing for market transparency.

NYSE-assigned specialists have four major roles:

1. As dealers, they trade for their own accounts in any temporary absence of public buyers or sellers, and only after executing all public orders in their possession at the specified price;
2. As agents, they execute market orders entrusted to them by brokers, as well as orders awaiting a specific market price;
3. As catalysts, they help bring buyers and sellers together; and
4. As auctioneers, they quote current bid-ask prices that reflect total supply and demand for each of the stocks assigned to them.

When carrying out their duties, specialists may act as either an agent or a principal. When acting as an agent, the specialist simply fills customer market orders or limit or stop orders (either new orders or orders from the limit order book) by opposite orders (buy or sell). When acting as a principal, the specialist assumes responsibility for maintaining a fair and orderly market. Regulations prohibit specialists from engaging in transactions in securities unless such transactions are necessary to maintain a fair and orderly market. Specialists profit only from those trades in which they are involved; that is, they realize no revenue for trades in which they act as agent.

The term fair and orderly market means that a market is characterized by price continuity and reasonable depth. Thus, specialists are required to maintain a reasonable spread between bids and offers and small changes in price between transactions. Specialists are expected to bid and offer for their own account if necessary to promote such a fair and orderly market. They cannot put their own interests ahead of public orders and are obliged to trade on their own account against the market trend to help maintain liquidity and continuity as the price of a stock goes up or down. They may purchase stock for their investment account only if such purchases are necessary to create a fair and orderly market.

Specialists balance buy and sell orders at the opening of the trading day to arrange an equitable opening price for the stock. They participate in the opening of the market only to the extent necessary to balance supply and demand. Although trading throughout the day is conducted as a continuous auction-based system, as explained earlier, the opening is conducted as a single-priced call auction system, as determined by the specialists.

If an imbalance between buy and sell orders either at the opening or during the trading day results in inability to maintain a fair and orderly market, a specialist may, under restricted conditions, close the market in that stock (i.e., discontinue trading) until the specialist is able to determine a price that reestablishes a balance of buy and sell orders. Such closings of trading can occur either during the trading day or at the opening, which is more common, and can last for minutes or days. Closings of a day or more may occur when, for example, one firm acquires another or when a corporation makes an unexpected announcement. (For this reason, many announcements are made after the close of trading.)

NYSE trading officials oversee the activities of the specialist and trading-floor brokers. Approval from these officials must be sought for a delay in trading at the opening or to halt trading during the trading day when unusual trading situations or price disparities develop. Because of their critical public role and the necessity of capital in performing their function as a market maker, specialists are subject to capital requirements imposed by the exchanges.

The description of the NYSE so far might leave the impression that the U.S. market is composed of a specialist-based NYSE; however, the NYSE made considerable strides toward electronic trading by internal development, specifically, the electronic DOT and SuperDOT systems beginning in 1976. But, the greatest changes have been more recent and are due to acquisitions.

The Pacific Exchange was a regional stock exchange based in San Francisco until 2001. In 1999, it became the first U.S. stock exchange to demutualize. Its trading floor in San Francisco was closed in 2002. In 2003, it initiated an electronic options trading platform. In 2005, the Pacific Exchange was bought by Archipelago Holdings, the first all-electronic stock exchange in the United States—this was a significant advancement in stock trading (Archipelago Holdings began in 1996 in Chicago). In

February 2006, the NYSE (actually, NYSE Euronext) merged with (through a reverse merger) Archipelago Holdings and changed its name to NYSE Arca. (The NYSE demutualized and became the for-profit NYSE Group just before this merger was accomplished.) Thus, NYSE had the first all-electronic stock trading platform in the United States. NYSE Arca is now NYSE's electronic trading platform and has significant trading volume. Arca is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange and is based in Chicago, where Archipelago, its founder, was located. Arca trades options and exchanged-traded funds in addition to stocks.

The NYSE continues to explore new markets. The NYSE is noted for its position with large listed companies and large investors. However, during 2017, it began changing its listing standards and its rule book to attract listings from IPOs by startups. The mechanism for doing this is "direct listing." The large IPO listings they are trying to attract are called "unicorns," which are startups valued 1 billion or more. Direct listings permit companies to trade without raising money (as in the typical IPO), and also no restrictions are imposed regarding when insiders can sell shares.[5]

The NYSE permits unicorns that want to be publicly traded but have sufficient cash to dispense with raising funds, so they do not need an investment banker to do an underwriting.

In a direct listing, a company transfers its shares to an exchange and lets them trade publicly without being underwritten by a Wall Street bank, as is the usual case in an IPO. The approach is often used by companies that are traded in the lightly regulated OTC markets but want to switch to the NYSE or Nasdaq. But it is a rare move for private firms, which typically use IPOs to go public.

Direct listings would allow unicorns to avoid hefty underwriting fees, which can amount to millions of dollars. The listings also could make it easier for existing shareholders of these companies to cash out more quickly. That is because they don't necessarily involve lockup periods, which are rules designed to protect new investors from a deluge of selling by making insiders wait before they can unload shares. Executives can also discuss the company publicly. In a typical IPO, the SEC mandates a quiet period before the offering.

Nasdaq Stock Market: Exchange Market for Unlisted Stocks

An OTC stock market is known as a market for unlisted stocks. There are two such markets. The first is the Nasdaq Stock Market, a national securities exchange registered with the SEC that trades unlisted stocks. The second is the collection of unrelated dealers who make markets in unlisted stocks. With respect to Nasdaq, although this market is referred to as a market for unlisted stocks, certain "listing requirements" must be maintained for a stock to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Nevertheless, exchange-traded stocks—such as the NYSE stocks—are called listed, and stocks traded in the Nasdaq Stock Market are called unlisted. Another part of the OTC market, referred to generally as the "third market," is for truly unlisted stocks (i.e., stocks not traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market).

The Nasdaq Stock Market is composed of three market tiers: (1) the Nasdaq Global Select Market; (2) the Nasdaq Global Market; and (3) the Nasdaq Capital Market. Each market tier has its own financial, liquidity, and corporate governance requirements that must be satisfied to be approved for listing. The corporate governance requirements for all tiers are the same. The most stringent financial and liquidity requirements are for the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the requirements for the Nasdaq Global Market are next, and the requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market are the least stringent. The market capitalization requirement is such that the Nasdaq Global Select Market includes large market capitalization stocks, the Nasdaq Global Market includes mid-market capitalization stocks, and the Nasdaq Capital Market includes small capitalization stocks.

Nasdaq is essentially a telecommunications network that links thousands of geographically dispersed market-making participants. Its electronic quotation system provides price quotations to market participants on Nasdaq-listed stocks. Although it maintains no central trading floor, Nasdaq functions as an electronic "virtual trading floor." More than 4,100 common stocks trade in the Nasdaq system. More than 500 dealers, known as market makers, representing some of the world's largest securities firms, provide competing bids to buy and offers to sell Nasdaq stocks to investors. Market makers must: (1) continuously post firm two-sided quotes good for most stocks; (2) report trades promptly; (3) be ready for automatic execution against their quotes; (4) integrate customer limit orders into their proprietary quotes; and (5) give precedence to customer limit orders and not place a quote on any system different from their Nasdaq quote unless that system is linked backed into Nasdaq. Many trades are "internalized," which means that a broker-dealer firm acts as market maker when executing on a principal basis the trade of one of its customers. Although not traded on an exchange, these trades must be reported through regular means, as discussed below.

# Alternative Trading Systems

As mentioned earlier, ATS are off-exchange trading venues that serve as an alternative to trading on exchanges and for after-hours trading. There are two types of ATSs, electronic communication networks and crossing networks.

Electronic communications networks Electronic communications networks (ECNs) display quotes that reflect actual orders and provide members with an anonymous way to enter orders. Essentially, an ECN is a limit order book that is widely disseminated and open for continuous trading to subscribers, who may enter and access orders displayed on the ECN. ECNs offer transparency, anonymity, automated service, and reduced costs; they are therefore effective for handling small orders. Because ECNs provide for pre-trade transparency about orders and post-trade transparency about executed trades, they are referred to as light pool markets, as opposed to venues known as dark pools that do not provide pre-trade transparency (we discuss them shortly). It important to note that some ECNs are now going "dark"—that is; they have dark pools. Similarly, some dark pools are being "lit"—they are now providing pre-trade transparency.

ECNs are used to disseminate firm commitments to trade (firm bids or offers) to participants, or subscribers, which typically have either purchased or leased hardware for the operation of the ECN or have built a custom connection to the ECN. In general, ECNs use the Internet to link buyers and sellers, bypassing brokers and trading floors. Examples of ECNs are Bloomberg Tradebook, Track ECN, and LavaFlow.

An ECN's subscribers include institutional and retail investors, market makers, and broker-dealers. In chapter 23, we describe the different types of orders. ECN subscribers can enter such orders into the ECN, and the orders will then be posted by the ECN on the system for other subscribers to view. The listing of the buy and sell orders that subscribers may view is the ECN's order book. The ECN will then electronically match orders to complete the execution. The buyer and seller typically remain anonymous to each other, with the publicly disclosed trade execution reports identifying the ECN as the counterparty to the trade.

The fee structure an ECN charges depends on the type of order. Orders either add to or remove liquidity from the ECN's order book. The fee structure involves a rebate to the party in the transaction that adds liquidity to the ECN's order book and a fee charged to the counterparty. Incentives in the form of higher rebates or lower fees may be offered to subscribers based on trade volume.

Brokers may allow customers direct market access to an ECN, with the fee and the rebate passed through from the broker to the customer.

Crossing networks ATSs allow institutional investors to "cross" trades, typically matching traders directly by computer buyers and sellers.7 Crossing networks are batch processes that aggregate orders for execution at specified times. Pre-trade transparency varies with the type of crossing network. Crossing networks that do not provide pre-trade transparency are called "dark pools."

For dark pools, post-trade transparency is required, but because the executed transactions are treated as OTC trades, less information is required than for trades on the NYSE. Because there is no pre-trade transparency (i.e., no public displaying of orders), dark pools provide institutional investors with several benefits, including less leakage of information contained in an order, the avoidance of front-running on large orders, and reduced market impact costs (a cost we discuss in chapter 23). With respect to information leakage, the order may be part of a proprietary trading strategy pursued by an intuitional investor, and a displayed order might provide information about such strategies to competitors. There is a concern that other market participants (such as broker-dealers and traders) could front-run the order, with the result that trading costs would be higher than in the absence of a public display of an order.

Some dark pools are either moving in the direction of pre-trade transparency or have done so already. For example, some dark pools use electronic messages to reveal an indication of interest, which is like a firm quotation, to a subset of subscribers.

Dark pools are classified based on the minimum size of transactions that can be traded for each order. Block-oriented dark pools set a minimum size for each order, such as 5,000 shares. Streaming liquidity pools have no minimum size for any order. Other characteristics of dark pools in addition to trade size are the ownership of the dark pool, who is permitted to trade in a dark pool (i.e., constituencies), price and order discovery, liquidity levels and types, accessibility, and the existence of liquidity partners. Based on the common characteristics of dark pools, Hitesh Mittal has identified five general categories (which are not necessarily mutually exclusive):8

- Public crossing networks: The traditional dark pools are the public crossing networks started by brokerage firms. Because of the reduction in commissions realized by brokerage firms, these dark pools sought to generate revenue to offset lost commissions. Examples of public crossing networks are POSIT, POSIT Now, BLOCKalert, Liquidnet, NYFIX Millennium, Pipeline, and Instinet CBX. A key feature of public crossing networks that distinguishes them from the other types of dark pools is that there is no proprietary flow from the operator of the dark pool.
- Internalization pools: Dark pools that are referred to as "internalization pools" seek primarily to internalize the operator of the dark pool's trade flow. Internalization pools were initially established by the major dealers to generate revenue by executing orders within the trading platform rather than sending those orders to other venues for execution. The constituents of internalization pools are institutional and retail investors and the dark pool operator's trading desk; internalization pools can restrict access to competitors (i.e., other sell-side firms). That is, unlike public crossing networks, not all the liquidity is obtained from external constituents but rather could come from the dark pool operator's market-making arm or its proprietary trading desk. However, because of a concern about the potential lack of liquidity, operators have partnered with other entities to provide liquidity. These liquidity partners have a special status as constituents that may have an adverse impact on the dark pool's regular customers.[9]
- Ping destinations: Two features of ping destinations distinguish them from other dark pools. The first is that if the order placed is not fulfilled immediately, the order is canceled. Such orders are referred to as "immediate or cancel" (IOC) orders and, therefore, unlike in other dark pools, which accept different types of orders, only IOC orders are accepted. The second distinguishing feature is that customers interact only with the dark pool operator's flow. Typically, this type of dark pool is operated by either a hedge fund or an electronic market maker. Customers are typically sell-side firms, not buy-side firms. The decision by the dark pool operator as to whether to accept an IOC order is based on a quantitative model developed by the operator.
- Exchange-based pools: Because they are similar in terms of pricing, dark pools classified as exchange-based pools include two types of dark pools. The first are dark pools that are registered with the SEC as national securities exchanges. (Recall that an ATS may elect to be regulated as a national securities exchange or as a broker-dealer.) The second type consists of ECNs and exchanges that create pools of liquidity resulting from hidden orders, where, unlike in other dark pools, the hidden order usually interacts with regular displayed orders. Unlike the other categories of dark pools, which charge a fee on a per share basis, exchange-based pools follow the ECN pricing policy, which provides fees and rebates depending on whether the transacting party is a supplier or a taker of liquidity.
- Consortium-based pools: A consortium-based pool is one that is started by several broker-dealers. Unlike an internalization pool operated by one broker-dealer that may not permit access to other sell-side firms (i.e., other broker-dealers), consortium-based pools provide access to their competitors that are sell-side firms. Broker-dealers that are partners in a consortium-based pool typically have an internalization pool for crossing trades so as to generate fee income before they route a trade to the consortium.

# Execution of an Order

With the considerable number of venues for the secondary trading of common stock, the processing of an order should be simple. However, that is not at all the case. The large number of alternative venues has created fragmented market making. It is important to understand the process by which an order is executed once it is placed with a broker. The reason is that how the broker ultimately executes the order affects the price at which the trade is executed and therefore the overall effective cost of the trade.

On receiving an order from a customer, a broker must decide how to execute the order. That is, the broker must decide which of the venues described earlier to use to execute the order. When deciding on the venue, the broker has an obligation to find the "best execution" that is reasonably available for customer orders. To do so, the broker considers all customer orders and makes an evaluation of which venue gives the most favorable terms.

When evaluating the alternative venues to obtain the best execution for customer orders, the broker will look for (1) a better price than quoted in the market when the order is placed (referred to as "price improvement"), (2) the likelihood that the order will be executed, and (3) the speed of execution. The speed of execution is important when a market order is placed, because in a fast-moving market, any delays in the execution of an order can result in an inferior price than at the time the order was received. Although the SEC does not set forth any rules that require the execution of an order be completed within a specific time after the order is placed, a brokerage firm that advertises about the speed at which it can execute an order would be expected to execute accordingly.

A customer does have the right to direct the broker to use a particular venue to execute an order, but a cost may be associated with doing so. A fee may be charged by the broker. Assuming that the customer does not specify a venue, the broker's decision as to which venue to direct the order to is as follows. For a stock that is listed on an exchange, the broker has three choices: (1) direct the order to the exchange where the stock is listed, (2) direct the order to a regional exchange, or (3) direct the order to a firm that stands ready to execute the order at publicly quoted prices. For this last alternative, such firms are referred to as third market makers. If instead of an exchange-listed stock, the order involves an unlisted stock traded on Nasdaq, the broker may send the order to a market maker on Nasdaq.

To induce brokers to route an order to their venue, regional exchanges, third market makers, and many Nasdaq market makers will pay brokers a fee based on the number of shares directed. This practice is referred to as payment for order flow. The broker cannot do this without the approval and knowledge of the customer. When an account is opened, the brokerage firm must inform the customer by written notification whether they receive payment for order flow. This notification must also be provided annually. Moreover, on a trade confirmation, the customer must be told whether the broker received a payment for order flow. If the customer desires, more information about the payment for a trade can be obtained by requesting the information from a broker.

Two other choices are available to a broker for routing an order: (1) a division of the broker's firm that can execute the order or (2) an ECN. When an order is routed internally (i.e., within the brokerage firm), the firm will fulfill the order from its own inventory. This is referred to as internalization of an order.

# Market Trading Regulation in the United States

Regulation of securities markets, such as the stock market, has three primary objectives: (1) to protect investors, (2) to ensure the smooth functioning of the market, and (3) to reduce systemic risk. When seeking to protect investors, regulation must address information asymmetries between the issuers of securities and investors. This can be achieved through disclosure regulation. The smooth functioning of the market involves trading and settlement rules that minimize the risk of market disruptions. Systemic risk has been discussed in several earlier chapters in this book.

Here our discussion of stock market regulation in the United States focuses on secondary market trading regulation. Recent regulations in this area were the result of financial crises in the stock market that required a major market regulatory overhaul or of high-profile market disruptions that necessitated plugging a regulatory gap. We begin with a brief description of stock market regulation in the United States since the 1960s and then turn to the current regulators. Finally, we look at several key regulations concerned with market volatility. We continue with our review of certain stock market trading regulations in chapter 23, because they require an understanding of trading strategies that regulators have found can cause market disruption.

# Regulatory Background

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. secondary markets for stocks became increasingly fragmented. In a fragmented market, some orders for a given stock are handled differently from other orders, as explained earlier in this chapter. Thus, the treatment of the order differs, depending on where it is ultimately executed. A differential treatment of orders may also arise if those orders vary in size, even if they pertain to the same stock and are executed in the same trading venue.

Regulators were concerned that investors did not uniformly receive the best execution, that is, that transactions were not necessarily being executed by a broker on behalf of a customer at the most favorable price available. Another concern with the increased fragmentation of the secondary market for stocks had to do with the growing number of completed transactions in listed stocks that were not reported to the public. This lapse in reporting happened because transactions in the third market and on the regional exchanges were not immediately disclosed on the major national exchange ticker tapes where the stock was listed.

Because of these concerns, Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1975. The most important and relevant provision of this legislation is Section 11A(a)(2), which amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and directed the SEC to "facilitate the establishment of a national market system for securities." The SEC, in its efforts to implement a national market system (NMS), targeted six elements, described as follows by N. S. Posner:[10]

1. A system for public reporting of completed transactions on a consolidated basis (consolidated tape).
2. A composite system for the collection and display of bid and asked quotations (composite quotation system).
3. Systems for transmitting from one market to another both orders to buy and sell securities and reports of completed transactions (market linkage systems).
4. Elimination of restrictions on the ability of exchange members to effect OTC transactions in listed securities (off-board trading rules).
5. Nationwide protection of limit price orders against inferior execution in another market.
6. Rules defining the securities that are qualified to be traded in the NMS.

These six elements required changes in technology, legislative initiative, or both. For example, a consolidated tape, composite quotation system, market linkage system, and system for nationwide protection of limit price orders required changes in technology. The elimination of off-board trading rules and the specification of securities to be included in a national market system required legislative initiative. In fact, changes of both types occurred.

In 2005, various relevant rules were consolidated into Reg. NMS, including the Order Protection Rule (also known as "trade-through rule"), which provides intermarket price priority for quotations that are immediately and automatically accessible (Rule 610). The Order Protection Rule has been controversial, because it requires that trades on a trading venue be transacted at the lowest price rather than on a venue offering the quickest or the most reliable execution.

Reg. NMS is intended to ensure that investors receive the best price executions for their orders by encouraging competition in the markets.

Reg. NMS consists of four different rules:

- "Order Protection Rule" requires trading centers to establish and enforce written policies designed to prevent the execution of trades at prices inferior to protected quotations displayed by automated trading centers;
- "Access Rule" requires fair and nondiscriminatory access to quotations, establishes a limit on access fees to harmonize the pricing of quotations across different trading centers, and requires each national securities exchange and association to adopt and enforce rules that prohibit their members from displaying quotations that lock or cross automated quotations;
- "Sub-Penny Rule" prohibits market participants from accepting, ranking, or displaying orders, quotations, or indications of interest in a pricing increment smaller than a penny, except for orders priced at less than 1.00 per share; and
- "Market Data Rules" update the requirements for consolidating, distributing, and displaying market information.

Overall, the general issue that the SEC has faced is how to design the NMS. Should it be structured as an electronic linkage of existing exchange floors? Or should it be an electronic trading system that is not tied to any existing exchange? After experimenting with several pilot programs, the SEC developed a set of arrangements for listed stocks.

As explained earlier in this chapter, although the market has evolved to an electronic trading platform since 1978, market fragmentation continues.

# Market Regulation

Here we describe regulation involving three activities: market volatility, short selling, and insider trading. More on market regulation is provided in the next chapter after we describe the various types of trading arrangements used by investors.

Market volatility rules Market volatility rules involve trading limit rules and circuit breakers.

Trading limit rules Trading limit (also referred to as a price limit) specifies a minimum price limit below which the market price index level may not decline because of an institutionally mandated termination of trading, at least at prices below the specified price (the price limit), for a specified period of time. For example, suppose that a market index was trading at 11,000 and its price limit was 500 points below that: Then no trades could occur below 10,500. This pause in trading is intended to "give the market a breather" to at least calm emotions. Two different types of price limits are circuit breakers and trading collars. We discuss each here.

Circuit-breaker rules A circuit breaker is a temporary halting of trading during a severe market decline. The key to instituting circuit breakers is coordination and infrequency. Coordination across markets is important because of the interrelationship among the stock market, stock index futures market, and stock index options market. We discuss this relationship in chapter 35. The infrequency with which trading was temporarily suspended was emphasized by several governmentand exchange-sponsored studies after Black Monday. These studies noted that too frequent halting of trading other than in the case of extreme movements impedes price discovery and does not allow the efficient implementation of portfolio strategies by investors.

Two types of circuit breakers have been adopted to deal with significant market volatility: market-wide circuit breakers and single-stock circuit breakers. The regulations deal with market-wide circuit-breaker rules that would be implemented depending on the level of market volatility. The trading could halt temporarily, or, in the case of extreme market volatility, the market could close before the normal close of the trading session. The stock market indicator selected to measure market volatility for determining trading halts is the S&P 500. The three circuit-breaker thresholds are  $7\%$

(Level 1),  $13\%$  (Level 2), and  $20\%$  (Level 3), with the triggers based on levels that are computed daily from the previous day's closing price of the S&P 500 index. Here is what the three levels mean. If a market decline that is either Level 1 or Level 2 occurs before 3:25 p.m., a market-wide suspension of trading activity will be imposed for 15 minutes; in contrast, if that trigger occurs on or after 3:25 p.m., no market-wide trading halt is required. In the extreme case of a market decline that occurs any time during the trading day triggered by a Level 3 circuit breaker, a market-wide trading halt is required for the balance of the trading day.

Single-stock circuit-breaker rules were adopted by the SEC in response to extreme movements in the prices of many individual stocks that did not result in the triggering of the market-wide circuit breakers. In May 2012, however, the SEC replaced the single-stock circuit-breaker rules with what is referred to as the "limit up-limit down" rule. The previous single-stock circuit-breaker rules were triggered after a trade occurred and at times could be triggered by erroneous trades. The intention of the limit up-limit down rule is to prevent trades in individual stocks from being executed outside a specified price band. The price band is established as a percentage level above and below the stock's average price, where the average price is computed over the immediately preceding five-minute trading period. Failure of the price of a stock trading outside the price band to return to a price in the band within 15 seconds results in a five-minute trading halt.

Short selling rules In chapter 18, we described short selling and the mechanism for selling a security short. A short sale is the sale of a security not owned by an investor. The expectation of an investor who shorts a security is that the price will decline, so that the investor can purchase the security at a future date at a price less than the price at which the security was sold. Short selling is illegal only if it done by an investor with an intent to manipulate the market. An example of such a manipulative practice would be an investor entering into a series of transactions with the intent of depressing a security's price so as induce the purchase or sale of the security by others.

Rules adopted by the SEC to deal with short sales include the alternative uptick rule and rules applied to naked short selling. The current short sale price test restriction for stocks, commonly referred to as the alternative uptick rule,[12] restricts short selling from further driving down a stock's price that has fallen more than  $10\%$  in a single trading day, with the drop being calculated based on the closing price on the previous trading day. If this short-sale-related circuit breaker is triggered, short selling is permitted only if the security's price exceeds the current national best bid.

Although the mechanism for selling short involves borrowing the shorted security to cover the sales, there are short sales where no borrowing occurs or no arrangement is made for borrowing in time for the settlement of the shorted security to the buyer. This is referred to as naked short selling. It may result in the short seller not being able to deliver the shorted security. A failure to deliver at the required settlement date is referred to as a "fail." Naked short selling is not a violation of SEC regulations. In fact, the practice of short selling may add liquidity to the market. A good example is the liquidity provided by a market maker who stands ready to sell a security continuously throughout the day. The market maker would effectively be pursuing a naked short selling if the market maker did not have the security in inventory and there were no sellers of the security in the market. In its objective of making a market for the security in a fast-moving market, the market maker may not have the time to arrange to cover the security sold through some borrowing arrangement or by the purchase of the security. The SEC adopted rules to deal with the problems associated with failed trades.

Insider trading rules An activity that undermines the confidence that investors have in the fairness and integrity of the stock market is trading in a stock by an insider using material nonpublic information. In general terms, the SEC describes illegal insider trading activity as the trading in a security that is "in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the security."[13] This is not a legal definition, because the laws dealing with insider trading are shaped by judicial opinions. That is, although

Congress gave the SEC responsibility and the enforcement powers (both criminal and civil) to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the market, what constitutes insider trading has been developed on a case-by-case basis under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (principally Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, described shortly).

Examples of insiders and illegal insider trading are corporate officers, directors, and employees who trade their corporation's stock following the acquisition of information that is a significant, confidential corporate development. Insider trading violations extend to others who may have received a tip ("tippees") from a person (the "tipper") who had access to material, nonpublic information. Examples of tippees are family members, friends, and business associates of such officers, directors, and employees who trade the securities after receiving such information.[14]

Not all trading by insiders is illegal. That is, corporate insiders can legally buy or sell the stock of their corporation provided the trading activity is not based on material, nonpublic information. Of course, when bringing any legal action against a corporate insider who buys or sells a stock prior to a major movement in the stock, the SEC must demonstrate that the trading activity was based on insider information. Trading their own corporation's stock by corporate insiders must be reported to the SEC within a specified time of the incident.

The federal securities laws covering insider trading are set forth in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which makes it illegal for individuals to use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe.

The SEC adopted Rule 10b-5 to implement Section 10(b). This rule defines when a trade is done on the basis of material nonpublic information. The SEC has two rules that make up Rule 10b-5: Rule 10b-5-1 and Rule 10b-5-2. The former applies to a person who trades on the basis of material nonpublic information if that person at the time of the trade knows that the information in his or her possession is in fact material nonpublic information. Conditions under which permissible trading may be done by an insider are described. For example, an insider is allowed to trade if that information is not a factor in the decision to trade. An example would be an executive who has an established investment plan that specifies the automatic purchase of the corporation's stock at designated time intervals.

The second part of Rule 10b-5, Rule 10b-5-2, applies to nonbusiness relationships' (e.g., family members' and friends') use of material nonpublic information when trading. The rule provides circumstances in which such nonbusiness relationships create what the SEC refers to as a "duty of trust or confidence" that if used by a person would be breached by the disclosure of material nonpublic information and would be considered illegal.[15]

# Other Types of Common Stock Trading

Other types of common stock trading vehicles and security types are available to investors.

# Offshore Trading

Broker-dealers may trade exchange-listed and Nasdaq equities offshore on foreign exchanges (e.g., the Bermuda Stock Exchange) or OTC through foreign trading desks (e.g., a broker-dealer's London office). In general, such transactions must be reported to a U.S. marketplace (typically the third market) during the next trading day.

# Rule 144A Securities

Rule 144A, adopted by the SEC in April 1990, is designed to facilitate secondary market trading in nonfungible unregistered securities among qualified institutional buyers by providing a "safe harbor" from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Qualified institutional buyers are institutions with 100 million invested in the securities of issuers not affiliated with the qualified buyer. Basically, Rule 144A permits the issue of nonregistered securities and their purchase by qualified institutions.

American depository receipts (ADRs) are negotiable certificates in registered form, issued in the United States by a U.S. bank, which certify that a specific number of foreign shares have been deposited with an overseas branch of the bank (or another financial institution) that acts as a custodian in the country of origin.

ADRs provide an opportunity for investors who want to invest in the shares of a foreign corporation to buy, hold, and sell their interests in these foreign securities without having to take physical possession of the securities, and while receiving dividends and exercising voting rights conveniently. A holder of an ADR can at any time request the underlying shares. Conversely, ADRs enable foreign corporations with shares that have not been admitted to a U.S. stock exchange to obtain access to the U.S. public capital market. Usually, only shares traded on a recognized foreign stock exchange are represented by ADRs. ADRs are discussed in greater detail below.

When a corporation's equities are traded in a foreign market, they are typically in the form of a global depository receipt (GDR), regardless of whether they were issued in the foreign market. GDRs are issued by banks as evidence of ownership of the underlying stock of a foreign corporation that the bank holds in trust. Each GDR may represent ownership of one or more shares of common stock of a corporation. The advantage of the GDR structure to the corporation is that the corporation does not have to comply with all the regulatory issuing requirements of the foreign country where the stock is to be traded. GDRs are typically, but not always, sponsored by the issuing corporation. That is, the issuing corporation works with a bank to offer its common stock in a foreign country through the sale of GDRs.

As an example, consider the U.S. version of the GDR, the ADR, just discussed above. The combination of GDRs and ADRs for a given company is called simply a "depository receipt." The initial success of the ADR structure in the United States resulted in the rise of GDRs throughout the world. ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars and pay dividends in U.S. dollars, but the basis for these payments is the local currency of the underlying stock. Thus, a change in the exchange rate between the local currency of the underlying corporation and the U.S. dollar will affect the ADR's U.S. dollar price and dividend.

ADRs can be created in one of two ways. First, one or more banks or brokerage firms can assemble a large block of the shares of a foreign corporation and issue ADRs without the participation of the foreign corporation, in which case the ADRs are called unsponsored ADRs. The Bank of New York is the leading U.S. depository bank for ADRs. More typically, however, with sponsored ADRs, the foreign corporation seeks to have its stock traded in the United States. In these instances, only one depository bank issues the ADRs. Periodic financial reports in English are provided by the issuing corporation to the holders of an ADR.

By construction, ADRs are not a direct holding in the company but a derivative created by a financial institution that holds the underlying securities. The holder of an ADR typically does not have voting or preemptive rights. The decision to treat ADR holders differently from direct stockholders, however, is at the discretion of the company. This distinction sometimes may not be applied.[16]

ADRs can either be traded on one of the exchanges or traded in the OTC market. The unsponsored ADR is typically traded in the OTC market. Because ADRs can be continuously created to meet investor demand, they provide the same trading liquidity as the home market securities they represent.

A U.S. investor who buys an ADR of an international company rather than hold the international stock directly can realize several advantages. First, the investor can trade the stock in a U.S. market (on an exchange or OTC) during U.S. hours and according to U.S. trading practices. Second, the investor makes and receives payments in U.S. dollars rather than foreign currency, although as already mentioned, the investor is subject to foreign exchange risk. Finally, the U.S. investor can use a U.S. custodian rather than a global one, which can be easier and save costs, and in some cases, can avoid some country-specific taxes.

Corporations may issue equities outside their home market to finance subsidiaries in other countries or to reduce the cost of raising equity capital. In fact, new equity issues may be offered in more than one country simultaneously. The term euro equity applies to a stock issue offered simultaneously in several countries by an international syndicate.

U.S. corporations engage in equity offerings that, in addition to the primary U.S. component, include a portion of the issuance reserved for sale in the Euromarkets. This portion of a newly issued stock is referred to as a euro-equity tranche. Similarly, European firms offer equity securities with a U.S. tranche. The innovation of the euro-equity markets was not a matter of new equity securities or structures. Instead, the innovation consisted of an efficient international system for selling and distributing equity offerings to various markets in different countries at the same time.

# Key Points
- Equity securities represent an ownership interest in a corporation, giving the investor the right to receive the earnings of the corporation when those earnings are distributed in the form of dividends.
- The two types of equity securities are common stock and preferred stock, the latter being a senior corporate security, because it has priority over the common stock in a claim on assets in a liquidation and receives a fixed dividend before common stock holders receive their dividends.
- The equity market has changed dramatically over the past 50 years because of (1) the institutionalization of the stock market as a result of a shift away from traditional small investors to large institutional investors, (2) changes in government regulation of the market, and (3) innovation owing largely to advances in computer technology.
- Important consequences of the shifting of the market from one dominated by retail investors to one dominated by institutional investors have included the redesign of equity trading systems to accommodate the types of trading required by institutional investors.
- To ensure that investors are protected against fraudulent practices that might be followed by corporations when issuing stock and by brokers and dealers when executing orders by investors, the equity market is highly regulated.
- Regulation is carried out by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC, a federal regulator), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA, a self-regulatory organization), and state regulators.
- The SEC is responsible for (1) interpreting and enforcing federal securities laws; (2) issuing new rules and amending existing rules; (3) overseeing and monitoring market participants; (4) overseeing private self-regulatory organizations involved in the securities field, including accounting and auditing organizations; and (5) coordinating regulation with other federal and state regulators and foreign authorities.
- FINRA is an independent, not-for-profit organization authorized by Congress.
- FINRA's dual objective is to protect investors and to foster market integrity.
- FINRA writes and enforces rules governing the activities of securities firms, examines securities firms for compliance with those rules, and fosters market transparency.
- State securities laws focus on the issuance of securities and periodic disclosure as opposed to market regulation.
- Equity trading in the United States typically occurs either on a national securities exchange or on an alternative trading system.
- The different types of trading venues can be classified in terms of their listing on an exchange: exchange-traded stocks (also called "listed" stocks) and OTC (unlisted) stocks.
- Information provided by trading venues is important for market transparency.
- Disclosure of a stock's supply and demand by a trading venue is referred to as "pre-trade transparency" and is measured by the bid-ask prices for a stock.
- The order book shows a stock's pre-trade transparency information, providing an indication of the liquidity and depth of the market for that stock.
- Pre-trade transparency is provided by the display of the stock's national best bid and offer (NBBO) on the Consolidated Quote System. The Consolidated Tape System provides post-trade transparency by providing post-trade data, including the transaction price and the quantity traded.
- Regional stock exchanges compete with the major national exchanges for the execution of smaller trades. Major national brokerage firms route such orders to regional exchanges because of the lower cost they charge for executing orders or better prices.
- The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the major exchange on which listed stocks are traded.
- On the NYSE, trading is done in a centralized continuous auction market at a designated location by a single specialist who is the market maker for each stock.
- Although at one time, the NYSE was a pure continuous-order market, today it uses both a continuous auction during the trading day and a call auction to open and close the market.
- Specialists are required to conduct the auction process and maintain an orderly market in one or more designated stocks.
- Specialists may act as both a broker (agent) and a dealer (principal).
- A specialist conducts activities so as to maintain a fair and orderly market, which means a market that is characterized by price continuity and reasonable depth.
- The OTC market has two components: (1) the national securities exchange, which is registered with the SEC and trades unlisted stocks, and (2) the third market.
- The national securities exchange registered with the SEC is the Nasdaq Stock Market, which has listing requirements that must be maintained for a stock to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
- The Nasdaq Stock Market is composed of three market tiers: (1) the Nasdaq Global Select Market, (2) the Nasdaq Global Market, and (3) the Nasdaq Capital Market.
- Nasdaq is essentially a telecommunications network that links thousands of geographically dispersed market-making participants.
- Nasdaq market makers must continuously post firm two-sided quotations good for most stocks.
- Many Nasdaq trades are "internalized," which means that a broker-dealer firm acts as market maker when executing on a principal basis the trade of one of its customers.
- An alternative trading system (ATS) is a trading venue that serves as an alternative to trading on exchanges and for after-hours trading.
- There are two types of ATSs: electronic communication networks (ECNs) and crossing networks.
- ECNs display quotations that reflect actual orders and provide subscribers (which include institutional and retail investors, market makers, and broker-dealers) with an anonymous way to enter orders.
- ECNs provide both pre-trade transparency about orders and post-trade transparency about executed trades and are referred to as "light pool markets."
- The fee structure imposed by an ECN depends on whether the order adds liquidity to or removes liquidity from the ECN's order book.
- Crossing networks are an ATS where orders are aggregated for execution at specified times, with pre-trade transparency varying by crossing network.
- Crossing networks that do not provide pre-trade transparency are called "dark pools." Post-trade transparency is required, but because the executed transactions are treated as OTC trades, less information is required than for a trade on the NYSE.
- When there is no public displaying of orders (i.e., no pre-trade transparency) in crossing networks, dark pools provide institutional investors several benefits: they reduce information leakage contained in an order, avoid front-running of large orders, and lower market-impact costs.
- Dark pools are sorted into five general categories: public crossing networks, internalization pools, ping destinations, exchange-based pools, and consortium-based pools.
- When deciding where to execute a customer's order, a broker has an obligation to find the "best execution" that is reasonably available for customer orders.
- When evaluating alternative trading venues to obtain the best execution, a broker will consider (1) a better price than quoted in the market when the order is placed, (2) the likelihood that the order will be executed, and (3) the speed of execution.
- A broker may route an order to a division of his or her firm for execution. This is referred to as "internalization" of an order.
- Federal regulation of securities markets has three primary objectives: (1) to protect investors, (2) to ensure the smooth functioning of the market, and (3) to reduce systemic risk.
- The U.S. equity market is referred to as a "fragmented market," because some orders for a given stock are handled differently from other orders.
- Trading or price limits specify a minimum price limit, below which the market price index level may not decline because of an institutionally mandated termination of trading, at least at prices below the specified price (the price limit), for a specified period of time.
- A circuit breaker is a condition precipitating a temporary halting of trading during a severe market decline. There are market-wide circuit breakers and single-stock circuit breakers.
- The two rules that the SEC has adopted to deal with short sales are the alternative uptick rule and a rule to deal with naked short selling.
- The purpose of the alternative uptick rule is to restrict short selling from further driving down the price of a stock that has fallen by more than  $10\%$  in a single trading day from the closing price on the previous trading day.
- Naked short selling refers to a short sale where no borrowing of the stock occurs or no arrangement with the buyer is made for borrowing in time for the settlement of the shorted security.
- The risk with naked short selling is that the short seller is not able to deliver the shorted security.
- Although there is no legal definition of insider trading, the SEC describes illegal insider trading activity as trading in a security that is "in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the security."
- What constitutes insider trading has been developed on a case-by-case basis under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
- Not all trading by corporate insiders is illegal, because they can legally buy or sell the stock of their corporation as long as the trading activity is not based on material nonpublic information.
- The SEC adopted Rule 10b-5-1 and Rule10b-5-2 to implement federal securities law dealing with insider trading.
- Other types of common stock trading vehicles and security types are available to investors: offshore trading, Rule 144A securities, and American depository receipts (ADRs).
- A company may want to list its shares on the exchanges of other countries in order to diversify its sources of capital across national boundaries and tap various funds available globally for investment in new issues. Management may believe that an internationally varied ownership diminishes the prospect of takeover by other domestic concerns, or it may expect foreign listings to boost the company's name awareness and, as a result, the sales of the company's products.
- When a corporation's equities are traded in a foreign market, they are typically in the form of a global depository receipt (GDR), regardless of whether they were issued in the foreign market. GDRs are issued by banks as evidence of ownership of the underlying stock of a foreign corporation that the bank holds in trust.
- The advantage of the GDR structure to the corporation is that the corporation does not have to comply with all the regulatory issuing requirements of the foreign country where the stock is to be traded.
- New equity issues may be offered in more than one country simultaneously. The term "euro equity" is used to describe a new stock offering that is offered simultaneously in several countries by an international syndicate.
