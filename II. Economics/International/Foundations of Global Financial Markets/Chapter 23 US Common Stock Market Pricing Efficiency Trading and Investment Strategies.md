# Equity Asset Classes

As explained in chapter 1, market participants talk about asset classes. Common stock or equity is one of the major asset classes. Based on studies of the performance of different categories of common stock, the market practice is to treat categories of stocks based on market capitalization and style. We discuss each category below.

# Asset Classes Based on Market Capitalization

In the second half of the 1970s, many academic studies suggested that simple categorization of stocks should be based on size as measured by market capitalization, because these size categories produced different performance patterns. A company's market capitalization (referred to simply as "market cap") is equal to the total market value of its common stock. It is calculated as follows:

Market cap = Price per share × Number of shares.

The calculation seems straightforward enough, except that "Number of shares" must be defined.

Two methods are used to calculate a company's market cap: the full-market cap method and free(float cap method. In the full market cap method, the number of shares used to calculate a company's market cap is all shares outstanding. In the free(float cap method, the number of shares used is the number of shares available in the market. The reason the number of shares available in the market differs from the free float is that there are shares given to, for example, top management, board members, and key employees. Thus, market cap based on the free(float cap method will produce a lower market cap than that using the full-market cap method.

Many services that calculate market caps for purposes of constructing a stock market index use the free-flat market cap method. The reason for using this method to construct a stock market index is that it provides a better indication of the stock market trends, because only those shares available for trade are considered. That is, only the shares of stocks that are available for trading are included.

The following are classified as asset classes for stocks based on market capitalization:

- mega-capitalization stocks (greater than 200 billion),
- large-capitalization stocks ( \$10 billion to\$ 200 billion),
- mid-capitalization stocks (\$1 billion to \$10 billion),
- small-capitalization stock ( \$300 million to\$ 1 billion),
- micro-capitalization stocks (\$50 million to \$300 million), and
- nano-capitalization stocks (less than 50 million).

In the early 1970s, academic studies found that there were categories of stocks that had similar characteristics and performance patterns. Moreover, the returns of these stock categories performed differently than did those of other categories of stocks. That is, the returns of stocks in a given category were highly correlated, and the returns between different categories of stocks were relatively uncorrelated. Practitioners began to view these categories of stocks with similar performance as a "style" of investing. Today, the notion of an equity investment style is widely accepted in the investment community. The acceptance of equity style investing can also be seen from the proliferation of style indexes published by several vendors, as well as the introduction of futures and options contracts based on some of these style indexes.

There are many ways to classify stocks based on style. The most common is in terms of one or more measures of "growth" and "value." These value/growth style categories have garnered ample empirical support. The most commonly used measure for classifying stocks as growth or value is the price-to-book value per share (P/B) ratio. The use of this measure is justified as follows. A company's earnings growth will increase the book value per share. Assuming that there is no change in the company's P/B ratio, its stock price will increase if earnings grow. Thus, the lower the P/B ratio is, the more the stock looks like a value stock; the higher the P/B ratio is, the more the stock looks like a growth stock.

When classifying stock as value and growth, the notion of "lower P/B" and "higher P/B" is relative. The way in which the stocks comprising a universe of stocks (say, the S&P 500) is placed in one of these two categories is done as follows:

Step 1: Calculate the total market capitalization of all the stocks in the universe.

Step 2: Calculate the P/B ratio for each stock in the universe.

Step 3: Sort the stocks from the lowest P/B ratio to the highest P/B ratio.

Step 4: Calculate the accumulated market capitalization starting from the lowest P/B ratio stock to the highest P/B ratio stock.

Step 5: Select the lowest P/B stocks up to the point where half of the total market capitalization computed in Step 1 is found.

Step 6: Classify the stocks found in Step 5 as value stocks.

Step 7: Classify the remaining stocks from the universe as growth stocks.

Any given growth and value style has a substyle based on some measure of size (market cap), as discussed above. The combinations of style and size are often displayed as in the following grid:

Large value

Large growth

Small value

Small growth

The four cells shown in the above grid have different risk/return combinations. In addition to book value (B), style is often calculated as a ratio to earnings (E); that is, the style ratio is  $\mathrm{P / E}$ , the price-to-earnings ratio.

# Stock Market Indexes

Stock market indexes perform a variety of functions, from serving as benchmarks for evaluating the performance of professional money managers to answering the question, "How did the market do today?" Thus, stock market indexes (or averages) are a part of everyday life. In general, stock market indexes rise and fall in fairly similar patterns. However, the various indexes do not move in exactly the same way at all times. The differences in movement reflect the different methods used for the construction of the indexes. Common stock indexes that are popularly cited in the media, and which are discussed below, are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq Index.

Now let us consider how stock indexes are created. To begin with, every stock index needs a sponsor, whose job it is to define the stocks in the index, collect the prices of these stocks on a daily basis, calculate the index from these prices, and distribute the index to users.

There are two different types of sponsors. The first type of sponsor is the exchange on which the stocks in the index are traded. The New York Stock Exchange Index and the Nasdaq Index are examples of this type of sponsor.

The second type is an independent financial organization that defines, calculates, and distributes the index. The Standard & Poor's Indexes and the Dow Jones Industrial Averages are examples of indexes having this type of sponsor.

A sponsor must make three decisions when developing an index from the individual stock prices. The first decision is how to define the general category or universe of the stocks to be included in the index. For example, the S&P 500 is intended to capture large capitalization (cap) U.S. stocks, the Russell 2000 captures small cap U.S. stocks, and the MSCI Developed Country Index captures the non-U.S. stocks from developed countries. Also, among the other categories represented in indexes besides size (large cap and small cap) are style (value and growth) and sector (financial, industrial).

Given the stocks included in the general category, the second decision that must be made is the selection of the specific stocks to be included in the index. The sponsors of some indexes choose the individual stocks in this universe in a transparent, rules-based methodology. The Russell indexes and the MSCI indexes are of this type. For example, the Russell 3000 is composed on an annual basis (on June 30 of each year) of the 3,000 largest stocks (by market cap). Other indexes are chosen by subjective decisions by the organization sponsoring the index. The S&P indexes and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes are based on such an ad hoc basis.

The third decision that must be made is the method used for weighting the individual stocks in the overall index, which we discuss next.

# Stock Weighting Methods

Three weighting methods have been traditionally used. The first method is price weighting; that is, using one share of each stock chosen (or the same number of shares). The second method is equal weighting; that is, using equal dollar values (e.g., 100) of each stock in the index. The third method is market capitalization weighting (price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding), that is, equal "cap weighting" values of each stock in the index.

Consider an example where two stocks are chosen to be in an index. Each of these three weighting methods is used to construct a weighted average of these two stock prices. Only the variables used as the weights differ. In our example, we will use two hypothetical stocks, A and B, with prices  \$5 and\$ 25, respectively, and market caps of \$20 billion and \$50 billion, respectively, as shown in table 23.1. The weights calculated according to each method are shown in the table in parentheses. The asset allocations (the percentage of each stock in the index) of A and B for each of the three weighting methods are also shown in the table. These numbers represent the fraction of the index in stocks A and B (i.e., the weight assigned to each stock). There is a considerable range of weights for A and B, depending on the weighting method used: from 16.7\% (for price weighted) to 50\% (for equal weighted) for Stock A.

Table 23.1 Stock weights by index weighting methods—hypothetical data.

<table><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Price Weighted</td><td>Equal Weighted</td><td>Market Cap Weighted</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>16.7\% (5/30)</td><td>50\%</td><td>28.6\% (20/70)</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>83.3\% (25/30)</td><td>50\%</td><td>71.4\% (50/70)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td></tr></table>

Table 23.2 provides an example of actual data for calculating these indexes for a stock universe consisting of only two stocks—Alphabet (formerly Google) and Ford Motor—which, let's assume, represent the entire stock market. The data are from May 21, 2016. Again, the three different indexes can be calculated from the data for these two stocks using the three different weighting methods. Note that the weight for Alphabet varies from  $98.2\%$  to  $89.0\%$  to  $50\%$  for the three weighting methods. The weights for Ford Motor vary from  $0.098\%$  to  $50\%$ . This example shows the very significant changes in the assigned weights for portfolios using these different weighting methods.

Table 23.2 Stock index weighting methods—actual data.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Price Weight</td><td>Equal Weight</td><td>Market Cap(in billions)</td><td>Earnings (Net Income)(in billions)</td><td>Book Value(in billions)</td></tr><tr><td>Alphabet</td><td>$715.31 (98.2\%)</td><td>1.00 (50\%)</td><td>$425.0 (89.0\%)</td><td>\$16.35 (68.9\%)</td><td>120.33 (80.8\%)</td></tr><tr><td>Ford</td><td>\$13.09 (1.8\%)</td><td>1.00 (50\%)</td><td>52.4 (11.0\%)</td><td>7.37 (31.1\%)</td><td>28.64 (19.2\%)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>$728.40</td><td>2.00</td><td>$477.4</td><td>$23.72</td><td>$148.97</td></tr><tr><td>Ratio (Alphabet\% / Ford\%)</td><td>54.6×</td><td>1.0×</td><td>8.11×</td><td>2.2×</td><td>4.20×</td></tr></table>

Note: Index weights are listed in parentheses.

Consider the metric for the "size" of a stock that we used in the illustration above—market capitalization. Although other measures of size are considered, the common metric is market capitalization, that is, the number of shares outstanding of the stock times the price of each share.

Historically, the earliest weighting methodology was the price weighted index, adopted for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), first published on May 26, 1896. This method involves simply buying one share of each stock in the index. Accordingly, to calculate the value of the index, the index provider simply adds the prices of the stocks and then divides by the number of stocks in the index. This method is still used for the DJIA (it now includes 30 stocks chosen by Dow Jones & Company, not all of which are currently industrials, despite the name given to the index). Thus, the price weighted average index would be tilted toward high priced stocks regardless of their market capitalization.

The equal-weighted method means that an investor selects the same value of each stock in the index. Thus, for an S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index,  \$1.00 of each of the 500 stocks would be included, for a total portfolio of\$ 500.00 with each stock holding 0.2\% (that is, $1.00/$500.00) of the total portfolio. Thus, the biggest and smallest (by market cap) stocks in the S&P 500 would have the same weights in the portfolio, obviously a "tilt" away from large stocks and toward small stocks. There are several equal-weighted S&P 500 mutual funds and exchange-trade funds (ETFs).

Both price weighted and equal-weighted indexes have significant limitations. The only justification for a price weighted index is that when the DJIA was developed in the 1890s, the only data readily available were stock prices. This index remains popular due to its simplicity and history. But the relationship between a stock's price and anything fundamental about the stock is spurious. In this regard, consider the data for ExxonMobil and FedEx on May 20, 2016:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Price</td><td>Market Cap</td></tr><tr><td>ExxonMobil</td><td>$89.74</td><td>$372.12 billion</td></tr><tr><td>FedEx</td><td>$161.63</td><td>$43.39 billion</td></tr></table>

It seems inappropriate to have an index in which FedEx has a weight  $80\%$  higher than that of ExxonMobil ( $161.63/$ 89.74 = 1.80) due simply to the fact that its price is  $80\%$  higher and even though ExxonMobil has a market cap that is more than eight times larger than that of FedEx (373.12/43.39 = 8.6).

The equal-weighted index also has a strong small-cap bias, which would cause confounding problems for an investor during a large-cap stock rally. As a result, it is not surprising that most indexes currently employ the third method—the market cap method—as the metric for size, and thus are market cap-weighted indexes.

Let us return to table 23.2, which shows the index weights for Alphabet and Ford Motor for May 21, 2016, for the three weighting methodologies. Note that the resultant weights vary widely for the price weighting, equal weighting, and market cap-weighting calculations. The market cap-weighted index appears to be more reasonable than either the equal-weighted or price-weighted index.

There are also theoretical arguments favoring market cap weighting. First, market cap-weighted portfolios are "macro consistent," meaning that if all investors invested in such a portfolio, all available shares in its universe would be held, and none would be left over, and so the prices would be stable equilibrium prices. With the other weighting methods, it is mathematically impossible for all investors to hold the stocks in this index portfolio at the initial prices. Thus, changes in portfolio holdings would be necessary, and security prices would change for all other weighting methods. Thus, if an investor holds a market cap-weighted portfolio and some market prices change, it is not necessary to rebalance the portfolio weights for the portfolio to continue to replicate the index—that is, the portfolio remains

"indexed." Not needing to rebalance to maintain index weights is a major practical and operational advantage of market cap weighting. It also conserves transaction costs. As a result, it is not surprising that most equity portfolio families employ primarily market cap weighting. These families include S&P, Russell, MSCI, and Morningstar.

But there is a major concern about market cap weighting. As mentioned, equal weighting has a small-cap bias. Recently, it has been pointed out that market cap weighting has a large-cap growth bias with, perhaps, some resulting investment disadvantages.

Given its theoretical advantage (macro consistency), operational advantage (no need for rebalancing), intuitive sense that securities should be weighted by size when forming an index, and given that market cap is the common measure of size for equities, it is not surprising that market cap weighting has become the dominant index weighting mechanism.

Recently, however, a limitation of the market cap-weighting method has been recognized. Consider portfolios that were indexed to or just followed generally the S&P 500 index as a benchmark during the tech bubble of 1995 to March 2000. During this period, significant appreciation was realized by large cap growth stocks, primarily due to the technology sector, at the expense of other sectors of the stock market. As this mania for large cap growth technology stocks continued, it became self-propelling because of the indexation process. As investments in large cap growth stocks continued, their prices increased, and as they became a component of the S&P 500 Index, they became overvalued. These investments were funded by the liquidation of large cap value and small cap value stocks. These purchases of larger cap growth stocks occurred due to either strict indexing or using indexing as a general benchmark.

As a result, this process led to large growth stocks becoming more expensive (higher price) due to buying as part of the index, and large and small value stocks becoming cheaper due to their lack of demand (because they were not part of the index). In essence, investors were buying expensive large cap growth technology stocks and selling—or not buying—cheap small cap value stocks. That is, they were "buying high and selling low," hardly an ideal investment strategy. Of course, bubbles always eventually burst, as this one did during 2000–2002. Note in the table below the sharp reversal of the returns of large cap growth and small cap value stocks from 1998, the core of the tech bubble, to 2001 after the bubble burst.

In the bubble year of 1998, large growth stocks significantly outperformed small value stocks. In the bubble-bursting year of 2001, this pattern reversed.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Returns</td></tr><tr><td>Large Growth</td><td>Small Value</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>0.3464</td><td>-0.0863</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>-0.1559</td><td>0.4024</td></tr></table>

These results indicate that market cap-weighted index strategies promote overbuying and overselling and thus cause volatile markets. Proponents of this view also proposed an alternative to market cap-weighted indexes. These proponents agree that size is a correct metric for weighting stocks in an index. They assert, however, that market cap is the wrong measure of size. It is the price variable in the market cap metric for size that promotes overbuying and subsequent overselling, basically providing self-fulfilling prophecies. These critics instead assert that the measure of size used should be a "fundamental" variable from corporate financial statements (income statement and balance sheet), rather than a price-based measure. It is the price variable in the size measure that causes the extreme overreactions. These alternate variables include net income, dividends, sales, cash flow, book value, among others. Such indexes weight stock prices by a measure of size, but that measure does not have a self-perpetuating feature, because it does not include the stock price variable. This approach has come to be known as "fundamental indexing." Many mutual funds and ETFs based on fundamental factors have become available. The most common fundamental factors used are net income and dividends. However, market cap-weighted indexes still dominate institutional and individual markets.

Although market cap weighting gives indexes a large-cap and growth bias, weighting by fundamental factors (such as net income and dividends) gives indexes a value tilt.

As mentioned earlier, stock market indicators can be classified into two groups: those produced by stock exchanges based on all stocks traded on the respective exchange, and those produced by other financial organizations that subjectively select the stocks to be included in an index.

The first group includes the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, which reflects the market value of all stocks traded on the exchange. The NASDAQ Composite Index also falls into this category, because the index represents all stocks tracked by the Nasdaq system. The second group includes the Dow Jones Composite Index and the S&P's stock indexes, which are produced by other financial organizations.

Some indexes represent a broad segment of the overall stock market, whereas others represent a particular sector, such as technology, energy, or financials. In addition, because the notion of an equity investment style is widely accepted in the investment community, some indexes are based on either of the two equity styles: growth or value. As for growth versus value, growth is the appellation applied to the stock of companies with high earnings growth expectations. That is, the stock is expected to appreciate as the company continues to generate future cash flow increments. In contrast, a value strategy involves investing in stocks that have low expected earnings growth and that the market has somehow undervalued. Other indexes have separate indexes based on size (that is, on small, medium, or large market capitalization stocks).

NYSE Composite Index The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index includes more than 2,000 stocks, of which approximately 1,600 are from the United States and approximately 360 are foreign. These include American depositary receipts (ADRs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and foreign listings. The NYSE also provides subindexes on tech/media/telecom, energy, financial, and healthcare. The NYSE uses a free-float market cap-weighting method. These indexes are not widely used in practice.

NASDAQ Composite Index The NASDAQ Composite Index also falls into the second group of stock market indicators. It includes all the stocks traded by Nasdaq. The index includes ADRs, tracking stocks, and limited partnership interests, but is heavily weighted toward information technology stocks. It is market cap weighted. It is one of the most commonly followed indexes in the U.S.

Nasdaq also provides the Nasdaq100 Index, which is based on 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies traded on Nasdaq. Since the tech bubble in 1995-1999, this index has come to be known as the "technology index." Nasdaq also provides less commonly used indexes based on industrials, banks, insurance, other finance, telecommunications, and computers. The Nasdaq100 and other subindexes are modified market cap-weighted indexes (they use rules capping the influence of the largest stocks).

Dow Jones Industrial Average The DJIA originally included 30 large and widely held industrial stocks. The companies included in the average are those selected by Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. The index now also includes technology, financial, and other sector stocks. The company now also provides the Dow Jones Transportation Average (20 stocks) and the Dow Jones Utility Average (15 stocks). The most controversial aspect of the DJIA is that it is price weighted (it is the only major index that is price weighted), most likely due to its early development (in the 19th century). Although price weighted, the price is adjusted for stock splits and other changes.

Standard & Poor's 500 Index Also in the second group, the S&P 500 Index represents 500 large—not necessarily the 500 largest—stocks chosen from the listings of the two major national stock exchanges (NYSE and NASDAQ) and the OTC market. The stocks in the index at any given time are determined by a committee of Standard & Poor's Corporation, which may occasionally add or delete (on no prespecified schedule) individual stocks or the stocks of entire industry groups. The committee has considerable discretion in its choice. A free float market cap-weighted index is used. (The float is the number of shares available for public trading, not the total number of shares outstanding.)

The S&P 500 is one of the most widely followed U.S. stock indexes and is commonly used as an indicator of the stock market. Standard & Poor's also provides indexes based on size and style. Their size indexes are the Mid-Cap 400 and Small-Cap 600, which along with the large cap S&P 500, provide the S&P Composite 1500, representing the entire stock market. S&P also provides style indexes (growth and value) for each size category. These subindexes are commonly used by investment professionals.

Neither the DJIA nor the S&P indexes have specific rules regarding which stocks must be included in their indexes or the timing of changes; that is, the composition of the indexes is not rules based. Thus, the composition of the indexes is determined by the discretion of the sponsor.

MSCI indexes MSCI Inc., formerly Morgan Stanley Capital International (called "MSCI"), provides a family of U.S. and global stock indexes (as well as fixed income and hedge fund indexes). The U.S. equity indexes are provided in the following categories: Investible Market (2,500 stocks), Prime Market Index (750 stocks), Large-Cap Index (300 stocks), Mid-Cap 450 Index (450 stocks), Small-Cap 1750 Index (1,750 stocks), and Micro-Cap Index.

Russell indexes Another family of nonexchange-sponsored U.S. stock indexes is the Russell Family, Russell Inc. In this family of equity indexes, the broad-based index is the Russell 3000, which is based on the largest 3000 stocks in the United States. The Russell 3000 index is divided into the large cap Russell 1000 and the remaining small cap Russell 2000 Index. These indexes are rebalanced annually, typically scheduled for the closing prices on the last Friday in June. These market caps determine the largest 3,000 stocks and the break-up into the 1,000 and 2,000 stocks. This process is called "reconstitution." This stock selection process is thus completely rules based, unlike the discretionary Standard & Poor's and DJIA processes. There are also growth and value versions of the Russell indexes. These indexes are widely used in practice.

Wilshire indexes The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index (the Wilshire 5000), sponsored by Wilshire Associates (in Santa Monica, California), is also a market cap-weighted index of most of the common stocks (including REITs) actively traded on the NYSE and Nasdaq. As of year-end 2016, the index had 3,618 stocks. This index has moderate use. Another Wilshire index, the Wilshire 4,500 Completion Index, includes the stocks in the Wilshire 5000 with the stocks in the S&P 500 removed.

In this regard, the number of publicly listed stocks has declined by approximately  $50\%$  from 7,322 in 1996 to 3,671 in 2016. The major reasons for this are that the delistings due primarily to mergers, acquisitions, and private equity activity have exceeded initial public offerings.

CBOE Volatility Index Another index which has become very popular in the equity markets is the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX, which stands for "volatility index"). The VIX is not a stock index, but it is a stock-related index. The VIX is a measure of the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index option, which is calculated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and used by stock traders. The VIX provides a measure of this option's market expectation of the S&P 500 stock market volatility over the next 30-day period. The VIX is quoted as a percentage, which is consistent with its being a volatility. A high VIX measure indicates that the stock market is expected to be very volatile and is regarded as a bearish signal. For this reason, the VIX is regarded as a "fear index." Futures and options contracts on the VIX are available from the CBOE.

# Pricing Efficiency of the Stock Market

As explained in chapter 18, a price-efficient market is one in which the security prices at all times fully reflect all available information relevant to their valuation. When a market is price efficient, investment strategies pursued to outperform a broad-based stock market index will not consistently produce superior returns after adjusting for risk and transaction costs.

Numerous studies have examined the pricing efficiency of the stock market. Although it is not our intent in this chapter to provide a comprehensive review of these studies, we can summarize their basic findings and their implications for investment strategies.

# Forms of Efficiency

The three different forms of pricing efficiency include (1) a weak form, (2) a semi-strong form, and (3) a strong form. The distinctions among these forms lie in the relevant information assumed to be taken into consideration in the price of the security at all times. Weak efficiency means that the price of the security reflects the past price and trading volume of the security. Semi-strong efficiency means that the price of the security fully reflects all public information, which includes (but is not limited to) historical price and trading patterns. This information includes, importantly, the financial information provided by the corporation to the SEC. Strong efficiency exists in a market where the price of a security reflects all information, whether it is publicly available or is known privately only to insiders, such as the firm's managers or directors. Of course, using inside information may be illegal.

The preponderance of empirical evidence supports the claims that the common stock market is efficient in the weak form. The evidence emerges from sophisticated tests that explore whether historical price movements can be used to project future prices in such a way as to produce returns above what one would expect from market movements and the risk class of the security. Such returns are known as positive abnormal returns. The implications are that investors who follow a strategy of selecting stocks solely on the basis of price patterns or trading volume—such investors are often referred to as technical analysts or chartists—should not expect to do better than the market. In fact, they may fare worse because of higher transaction costs associated with frequent buying and selling of stocks.

The evidence is mixed on whether the stock market is price efficient in the semi-strong form. Some studies support the proposition of efficiency when they suggest that investors who select stocks on the basis of fundamental security analysis—which consists of analyzing financial statements, the quality of management, and the economic environment of a company—will not outperform the market. This result is certainly reasonable: so many analysts use the same approach, with the same publicly available data, that the price of the stock remains in line with all the relevant factors that determine value. In contrast, a sizable number of other studies have produced evidence indicating instances and patterns of pricing inefficiency in the stock market over long periods. Economists and financial analysts often label these examples of inefficient pricing anomalies in the market, that is, phenomena that cannot be easily explained and often persist. Semi-strong efficiency remains controversial.

Empirical tests of the strong form of pricing efficiency fall into two groups: (1) studies of the performance of professional money managers and (2) studies of the activities of insiders (persons who are company directors, major officers, or major stockholders). Studies of the performance of professional money managers to test the strong form of pricing efficiency are based on the belief that professional managers have access to better information than is available to the general public. Whether this point is true is moot, because the empirical evidence suggests professional managers do not outperform the market consistently. In contrast, evidence based on the activities of insiders generally reveals that this group often achieves higher returns than does the stock market. Of course, insiders could not get those high abnormal returns if the stock prices fully reflected all relevant information about the values of the firms. Thus, the empirical evidence on insider trading argues against the notion that the market is efficient in the strong form sense. This activity is referred to insider trading and is not legal.

Efficient market hypothesis and the random walk hypothesis The efficient market hypothesis states that the market incorporates new information completely and quickly. In an efficient market, stock prices behave as if they followed a random walk (sometimes called a "drunken sailor's walk"). According to the random walk hypothesis, at any time, it cannot be determined whether prices will increase or decrease during the next period.

Expressed mathematically, the next period's price, denoted by  $P_{t+1}$ , can be expressed as the current period's price, denoted by  $P_t$ , plus a random error term denoted by  $e_{t+1}$ :

$$
P _ {t + 1} = P _ {t} + e _ {t + 1}.
$$

The serial correlation coefficient is the correlation coefficient between  $P_{t+1}$  and  $P_t$ . Statistically, the serial correlation coefficient (also called the "autocorrelation coefficient") is the extent to which the price in one period is related to the next period's price.

If the serial correlation coefficient is zero, the returns exhibit a random walk relationship and are random. If the serial correlation is positive or negative, the returns exhibit a relationship and have positive or negative momentum, respectively. Based on annual returns for large cap and small cap stocks, the serial correlation coefficients over the period 1926 to 2016 are both approximately zero (0.02 and 0.06, respectively).

The efficient market hypothesis and the random walk hypothesis are related but not identical. To be efficient, market prices must exhibit a random walk as prices grope toward the efficient level. But prices could exhibit a random walk without being efficient. A pricing model, in addition, is necessary to determine the efficiency of a market. Thus, a random walk is a necessary but not sufficient condition for market efficiency. Calculating the degree of randomness in a series is simple, but determining the efficiency of a market is difficult and remains a controversial topic.

Overall, if a market is highly price efficient, it is impossible to outperform the market consistently and, as a result, a passive strategy is ideal. For active strategies to be appropriate, there must be inefficiencies in market prices that can be exploited. Of course, these active strategies would also have to cover transaction costs to be successful.

Micro versus Macro Stock Market Efficiency

Professor Paul Samuelson, the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic Science, made the following comment about stock market efficiency:

Modern markets show considerable micro efficiency (for the reason that the minority who spot aberrations from micro efficiency can make money from those occurrences and, in doing so, they tend to wipe out any persistent inefficiencies). In no contradiction to the previous sentence, I had hypothesized considerable macro inefficiency, in the sense of long waves in the time series of aggregate indexes of security prices below and above various definitions of fundamental values.2

Basically, Samuelson argued that the efficient market hypothesis is likely to work better for individual stocks than for the aggregate stock market. That is, the stock market, according to Samuelson, is "micro efficient" but not necessarily "macro inefficient." This view, referred to as "Samuelson's dictum," has considerable empirical support. Studies have looked for efficiency in the aggregate stock market and in various components of the stock market, such as industries. Inefficiencies in terms of pricing were measured in these studies on the basis of excess volatility (i.e., volatility that should not be excessive in an efficient market). The studies found that inefficiencies existed at the aggregate stock market level (thereby providing support for macro inefficiency) but not at the industry sector or the individual security level (thereby providing support for micro efficiency).

Implications of Market Efficiency for Investing in Common Stock

Common stock investment strategies can be classified into two general categories: active strategies and passive strategies. Active investment strategies attempt to outperform the market by one or more of the following methods: timing the selection of transactions, such as in the case of technical analysis; identifying undervalued or overvalued stocks using fundamental security analysis; and selecting stocks according to market anomalies. Obviously, the decision to pursue an active strategy rests on the belief that some type of gain can be made from such efforts, even after costs, but gains are possible only if pricing inefficiencies exist. The particular strategy chosen depends on what pricing inefficiencies the investor believes are occurring.

Investors who believe that the market is pricing stocks efficiently should accept the implication that attempts to outperform the market cannot be systematically successful, except by luck. This implication does not mean that investors should shun the stock market but instead suggests that they should pursue a passive investment strategy, which is one that does not attempt to outperform the market. Is there an optimal investment strategy for someone who holds this belief in the pricing efficiency of the stock market and thereby captures the risk premiums in the stock market? There is. Its theoretical basis is modern portfolio theory and capital market theory, which we discussed in chapter 13. According to modern portfolio theory, the market portfolio offers the highest level of return per unit of risk in a market that is price efficient. A portfolio of financial assets with characteristics similar to those of a portfolio consisting of the entire market—the market portfolio—will capture the pricing efficiency of the market.

But how can such a passive strategy be implemented? More specifically, what is meant by a "market portfolio," and how should that portfolio be constructed? In theory, the market portfolio consists of all financial assets, not just common stock. The reason is that investors compare all investment opportunities, not just stock, when committing their capital. Thus, our principles of investing must be based on capital market theory, not just stock market theory. When the theory is applied to the stock market, the market portfolio consists of a large universe of common stocks. But how much of each common stock should be purchased when constructing the market portfolio? Theory states that the chosen portfolio should be an appropriate fraction of the market portfolio; hence the weighting of each stock in the market portfolio should be based on its relative market capitalization. Thus, if the aggregate market capitalization of all stocks included in the market portfolio is T and the market capitalization of one of these stocks is A, then the fraction of this stock that should be held in the market portfolio is $A/$T.

The passive strategy just described is called indexing. As evidence mounted about the inability of many investment managers to outperform the stock market on a risk-adjusted basis after transaction costs and fees, the amount of funds managed using an indexing strategy grew substantially. However, index funds still account for a relatively large and still-growing fraction of institutional stock investments.

Traditionally, the benchmarks for indexing strategies have been one of the broad-based market indexes designed around market capitalization weighting, as described earlier in the chapter. However, there has been increasing interest in the use of alternative benchmarks as a low-cost strategy to capture the risk premiums in the stock market. This strategy is referred to as a smart beta strategy. The underlying assumption of those who support a smart beta strategy is that, in contrast to indexing, which seeks to replicate the risk premiums embedded in an overall stock market index, a smart beta strategy seeks to capture a risk premium of subsets of the overall stock market by means of a low-cost investment process. To do so, a smart beta strategy requires the identification of systematic risk drivers of stock returns to construct a benchmark (which is referred to as "smart beta") that may offer a better risk/return profile than one of the traditional market cap-weighted stock market indexes.

A hybrid of the pure passive and pure active approaches is the core-satellite strategy, wherein the overall portfolio has a core of large holdings in passive, low-cost energy holdings in efficient asset classes and satellites around the core consisting of small holdings of more expensive, active noncore holdings.

# Common Stock Investment Strategies

Investment strategies pursued by professional money managers can be organized in several different ways. The most common method is to divide strategies into two categories: passive and active, as introduced above.

To begin simply, assume that an investor's portfolio has  $N$  stocks,  $S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{N}$ . The investor wants to develop a portfolio of these  $N$  stocks with weights  $WS_{1}, WS_{2}, \ldots, WS_{N}$ . Assume also that the investor has selected an index  $I$ , which is used as a basis for the portfolio—the index has weights  $IS_{1}, IS_{2}, \ldots, IS_{N}$ .

A passive portfolio—also called an index portfolio—relative to the index  $I$ —is one in which:  $WS_{1} = IS_{1}$ ,  $WS_{2} = IS_{2}$ , …,  $WS_{N} = IS_{N}$ . That is,  $WS_{i} = IS_{i}$  for all  $i$ . The weight of each stock in the portfolio is identical to its weight in the index.

If this is the definition of a passive strategy, what is the definition of an active strategy? The answer is "anything else." That is, at least two of the weights in the portfolio must be different than the weights in the index (obviously, one difference cannot occur alone). As a result, for a given set of  $N$  stocks, there is only one passive strategy, but there are an infinite number of active strategies. For  $WS_{i} \neq IS_{i}$  (for any two or more  $i$ ), the strategy is active.

Note that the return on a pure passive portfolio must equal the return on the index (excluding expenses, which are considered below). Note also that the return on any individual active portfolio may be greater or less than the return on the index; that is, an individual active managed portfolio may outperform or underperform its index, respectively. As stated by William Sharpe, the original findings on this topic are:

If "active" and "passive" management styles are defined in sensible ways; it must be the case that:

(2) after costs, the return on the average actively managed dollar will be less than the return on the average passively managed dollar.

These assertions hold for any time period.5

Basically, "passive" has a singular meeting—it means to match an index exactly, both in composition and weights of the securities therein. But there are many different types of active portfolios.

Traditionally, the two dominant active strategies have been "stock picking" and "market timing." Stock picking means overweighting and/or underweighting (including zero weights) some stocks relative to their index. Equity analysts determine which stocks to overweight or underweight by fundamental analysis. Market timing refers to shifting between high expected return assets and low expected return assets, depending on the degree of bullish and bearish beliefs of the investor, often shifting between stocks and cash.

Between the polar extremes of passive and active strategies, there are developments on a continuum of strategies based on their "degree of activeness." Some portfolios may deviate from their indexes significantly; others only slightly.

The strategies addressed thus far have had only long positions, that is, where stocks are purchased with cash. These are called "long-only" strategies. Beginning with hedge funds, however, investors have also used short positions. Short positions are achieved by borrowing a company's stock from another party (for example, a broker), selling the stock, and then using the cash from the sale to purchase additional stocks or let it remain in cash. These are called long-short strategies. Overall, a long positon is a bullish position; that is, the position profits if the stock price increases. A short position is a bearish position; that is, a short position profits if the stock price decreases. Consequently, long-short strategies can be either bullish or bearish, depending on the identities and weights of the long and short positions.

# Common Stock Trading Arrangements

Trading arrangements involve the types of orders placed by investors. We begin with the types of orders, margin transactions, trading priority rules, and transaction costs. We then discuss trading arrangements for retail trading and those for institutional investors (block trades and program trades) for coping with the trading needs of institutional investors.

# Types of Orders

When an investor wants to buy or sell a share of common stock, the price and conditions under which the order is to be executed must be communicated to a broker. As explained in chapter 18, the simplest type of order is the market order, an order to be executed at the best price available in the market. If the stock is listed and traded on an organized exchange, the best price is ensured by the exchange rule that when more than one order on the same side of the buy/sell transaction reaches the market at the same time, the order with the best price is given priority. Thus, buyers bidding a higher price are given priority over those bidding a lower price, and sellers offering a lower price are given priority over those offering a higher price.

Another priority rule of exchange trading is needed to handle the receipt of more than one order at the same price. Most often, the priority in executing such orders is based on the time of arrival of the order—the first orders in are the first orders executed—although higher priority is given to certain types of market participants over other types of market participants seeking to transact at the same price. For example, on exchanges, orders may be classified as either public orders or orders of those member firms dealing for their own accounts (both nonspecialists and specialists). Exchange rules require that public orders be given priority over orders of member firms dealing for their own accounts.

The danger of a market order is that an adverse price movement may take place between the time the investor places the order and the time the order is executed. To avoid this danger, the investor can place a limit order that designates a price threshold for the execution of the trade. A buy limit order indicates that the stock may be purchased only at the designated price or lower. A sell limit order indicates that the stock may be sold at the designated price or higher. The key disadvantage of a limit order is that it offers no guarantee that it will be executed at all; the designated price may simply not be obtainable. A limit order that is not executable at the time it reaches the market is recorded in a limit order book, as mentioned in the chapter 22.

The limit order is a conditional order: It is executed only if the limit price or a better price can be obtained. Another type of conditional order is the stop order, which specifies that the order is not to be executed until the market moves to a designated price, at which time it becomes a market order. A buy stop order specifies that the order is not to be executed until the market rises to a designated price, that is, until it trades at or above, or is bid at or above, the designated price. A sell stop order specifies that the order is not to be executed until the market price falls below a designated price, that is, until it trades at or below, or is offered at or below, the designated price. A stop order is useful when an investor cannot watch the market constantly. Profits can be preserved or losses minimized on a stock position by allowing market movements to trigger a trade. In a sell (buy) stop order, the designated price is lower (higher) than the current market price of the stock. In a sell (buy) limit order, the designated price is higher (lower) than the current market price of the stock. The relationship between the two types of conditional orders, and the market movements that trigger them, appear in table 23.3.

Table 23.3 Conditional orders and the direction of triggering security price movements.

<table><tr><td>Price of Security</td><td>Limit Order</td><td>Market-If-Touched Order</td><td>Stop-Limit Order</td><td>Stop Order</td></tr><tr><td>Higher than initial price</td><td>Price specified for a sell limit order</td><td>Price specified for a sell market-if-touched order</td><td>Price specified for a buy stop-limit order</td><td>Price specified for a buy stop order</td></tr><tr><td>Lower than initial price</td><td>Price specified for a buy limit order</td><td>Price specified for a buy market-if-touched order</td><td>Price specified for a sell stop-limit order</td><td>Price specified for a sell stop order</td></tr><tr><td>Comment</td><td>Can be filled only at price or better; does not become a market order until price is reached</td><td>Becomes a market order when price is reached</td><td>Does not become a market order when price is reached; can be executed only at price or better</td><td>Becomes a market order when price is reached</td></tr></table>

Two dangers are associated with stop orders. Stock prices sometimes exhibit abrupt price changes, so the direction of a change in a stock price may be quite temporary, resulting in the premature trading of a stock. Also, once the designated price is reached, the stop order becomes a market order and is subject to the uncertainty of the execution price noted earlier for market orders.

A stop-limit order, a hybrid of a stop order and a limit order, is a stop order that designates a price limit. In contrast to the stop order, which becomes a market order if the stop is reached, the stop-limit order becomes a limit order if the stop is reached. The stop-limit order can be used to cushion the market impact of a stop order. The investor may limit the possible execution price after the activation of the stop. As with a limit order, the limit price may never be reached after the order is activated, which therefore defeats one purpose of the stop order—to protect a profit or limit a loss.

An investor may also enter a market-if-touched order. This order becomes a market order if a designated price is reached. A market-if-touched order to buy becomes a market order if the market falls to a given price, whereas a stop order to buy becomes a market order if the market price rises to a given price. Similarly, a market-if-touched order to sell becomes a market order if the market rises to a specified price, whereas the stop order to sell becomes a market order if the market falls to a given price. We can think of the stop order as an order designed to get out of an existing position at an acceptable price (without specifying the exact price) and the market-if-touched order as an order designed to get into a position at an acceptable price (also without specifying the exact price).

Orders may be placed to buy or sell at the open or the close of trading for the day. An opening order indicates a trade to be executed only in the opening range for the day, and a closing order indicates a trade is to be executed only within the closing range for the day.

An investor may enter orders that contain order cancellation provisions. A fill-or-kill order must be executed as soon as it reaches the trading floor or it is immediately canceled. Orders may designate the period for which the order is effective—a day, week, or month, or perhaps by a given time within the day. An open order, or good until canceled order, is good until the investor specifically terminates the order.

An important type of order that is key in a trading strategy discussed later (high-frequency trading) is a flash order. With a flash order, the trade must be executed immediately or withdrawn if not executed immediately.

Orders are also classified by their size. One round lot is typically 100 shares of a stock. An odd lot is defined as less than a round lot. For example, an order of 75 shares of Microsoft is an odd lot order. An order of 350 shares of Microsoft includes an odd lot portion of 50 shares. A block trade is defined on the NYSE as an order of 10,000 shares of a given stock or a total market value of 200,000 or more.

# Margin Transactions

As explained in chapter 18, investors can borrow cash to buy securities and use the securities themselves as collateral. A transaction in which an investor borrows to buy shares using the shares themselves as collateral is referred to as buying on margin. The funds borrowed to buy the additional stock will be provided by the broker, and the broker gets the money from a bank. The call money rate or broker loan rate is the interest rate that banks charge brokers for funds for this purpose. The broker charges the borrowing investor the call money rate plus a service charge.

A brokerage firm is not free to lend as much as it wishes to the investor to buy securities. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") prohibits brokers from lending more than a specified percentage of the market value of the securities. The initial margin requirement is the proportion of the total market value of the securities that the investor must pay as an equity share, and the remainder is borrowed from the broker. The Exchange Act gives the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the Fed) the responsibility to set initial margin requirements, which it does under Regulations T and U. The Fed changes margin requirements as an instrument of economic policy. The initial margin requirement was previously below  $40\%$ ; it is  $50\%$  as of this writing. Initial margin requirements vary for stocks and bonds.

The Fed also establishes a maintenance margin requirement, which is the minimum proportion of the equity in the investor's margin account to the total market value. If the investor's margin account falls below the minimum maintenance margin (which would happen if the share's price fell), the investor is required to put up additional cash. The investor receives a margin call from the broker specifying the additional cash to be put into the investor's margin account. If the investor fails to put up the additional cash, the broker has the authority to sell the securities for the investor's account.

Let us illustrate maintenance. Assume that an investor buys 100 shares of stock at \$60 per share for \$6,000 of stock on 50\% margin, and the maintenance margin is 25\%. By purchasing \$6,000 of stock on 50\% margin, the investor must put up \$3,000 in cash (or other equity) and thus borrows \$3,000 (referred to as the debit balance). The investor, however, must maintain 25\% of margin. To what level must the stock price decline to hit the maintenance margin level? The price is \$40. At this price, the stock position has a value of $4,000 ($40 × 100 shares). With a loan of \$3,000, the equity in the account is $1,000 ($4,000 - \$3,000), or 25\% of the account value ($1,000/$4,000 = 25\%). If the price of the stock decreases below 40, the investor must deposit more equity to bring the equity level up to 25\%. In general, the account level has to decrease to 1.333 times the amount borrowed (the debit balance) to hit the minimum maintenance margin level.

Margin practices also apply in short selling. Let's consider a similar margin example for a short position. An investor shorts (borrows and sells) 100 shares of stock at  \$60 for a total stock value of\$ 6,000. With an initial margin of 50\%, the investor must deposit \$3,000 (in addition to leaving the \$6,000 from the sale in the account). So the investor has a credit balance of \$9,000 (which does not change with the stock price, because it is in cash). However, the investor owes 100 shares of the stock at the current market price. To what level must the stock price increase to hit the maintenance margin level, assumed to be 30\% (which is the equity in the account as a percentage of the market value of the stock)? The answer is \$69.23, for a total stock value of \$6,923. If the stock is worth \$6,923, the account contains \$2,077 of equity ($9,000 - $6,923), which represents 30\% of the market value of the stock ($2,077/$6,923 = 30\%). The value of the stock that triggered the maintenance level is calculated by multiplying the credit balance by 10/13 (10/13 × \$9,000 = 6,923).

# Trading (Transaction) Costs

Investment managers must meet performance standards, which are typically based on the total rate of return of their portfolios. The returns on their portfolios are net of transaction (or trading) costs. One-half of one percentage point in return can substantially affect a manager's record. Therefore, an important aspect of an investment strategy is controlling the transaction costs necessary to implement the strategy. The measurement of trading costs, although important, is difficult.[8]

Institutional investors have developed computer-automated programs to enter trading orders to minimize the costs associated with trading, which we discuss below. The use of computer programs for this purpose is known as algorithmic trading. Once an institutional investor makes a decision to buy or sell a large stock position, the program partitions the trade into several smaller orders to minimize transaction costs.

We begin by defining trading costs. Trading costs can be decomposed into two major components: explicit costs and implicit costs. Explicit trading costs are the direct costs of trading, such as broker commissions, fees, and taxes. Implicit trading costs represent such indirect costs as the price impact of the trade and the opportunity costs of failing to execute in a timely manner or at all. Whereas explicit costs are associated with identifiable accounting charges, no such reporting of implicit costs occurs.

Explicit costs The main explicit cost is the commission paid to the broker for execution. Commission costs are fully negotiable and vary systematically by broker type and market mechanism. The commission may depend on both the price per share and the number of shares in the transaction. In addition to commissions, other explicit costs include custodial fees (the fees charged by an institution that holds securities in safekeeping for an investor) and transfer fees (the fees associated with transferring an asset from one owner to another).

Competition and computer technology have driven down the bid-ask spread for stocks to as little as one penny per share. The decline in explicit trading costs began with the elimination of fixed commissions by the SEC on May 1, 1975, commonly called "May Day." After this date, trading fees were set by market competition. Prior to 2001, stock prices were quotes in increments of one-eighth of a dollar, or 12.5 cents. In 2001, the SEC eliminated this pricing practice and moved to decimalization, which resulted in the spreads declining to as little as one penny per share. In the opinion of some analysts, the impact of decimalization compares to that of the end of fixed commissions.

Implicit costs Implicit trading costs include impact costs, timing costs, and opportunity costs.

The impact cost of a transaction is the change in market price resulting from supply/demand imbalances caused by the presence of the trade. Bid-ask spread estimates, although informative, fail to capture the fact that large trades—those that exceed the number of shares the market maker is willing to trade at the quoted bid and ask prices—may move prices in the direction of the trade. That is, large trades may increase the price for buy orders and decrease the price for sell orders. The resulting market impact or price impact of the transaction can be thought of as the deviation of the transaction price from the "unperturbed price" that would prevail if the trade did not occur. Crossing networks, discussed in chapter 22, are designed to minimize impact costs.

Timing cost is measured as the price change between the time the parties to the implementation process assume responsibility for the trade and the time they complete the trade. Timing costs occur when orders sit on the trading desk of a buy-side firm (e.g., an investment management firm) but are not yet released to the broker, because the trader fears that the trade may swamp the market.

Opportunity cost is the "cost" of securities not traded. This cost results from missed or only partially completed trades. These costs are the natural consequence of the release delays. For example, if the price moves too much before the trade can be completed, the manager will not make the trade. In practice, this cost is measured on shares not traded, based on the difference between the market price at the time of decision and the closing price 30 days later.

Although commissions and impact costs are actual and visible out-of-pocket costs, opportunity costs and timing costs are the costs of forgone opportunities and are invisible. Opportunity costs can arise for two reasons. First, some orders are executed with a delay, during which the price moves against the investor. Second, some orders incur an opportunity cost, because they are only partially filled or are not executed at all.

Research on trading costs Overall, although the trading commission is the most obvious, measurable, and discussed trading cost, it is only one of the four types of trading costs and, in fact, may be the smallest. The implicit trading costs, however, are much more difficult to measure.

Studies about transaction costs allow us to draw several conclusions:

1. Although considerable debate still surrounds how to measure trading costs, the consensus is that implicit trading costs are economically significant relative to explicit costs (and also relative to realized portfolio returns).
2. Equity trading costs vary systematically with trade difficulty and order-placement strategy.
3. Differences in market design, investment style, trading ability, and reputation are important determinants of trading costs.
4. Even after researchers control for trade complexity and trade venue, trading costs vary considerably across managers.
5. The accurate prediction of trading costs requires more detailed data on the entire order-submission process than are available, especially information on pre-trade decision variables.

Trading Arrangements for Institutional Investors

With the increase in trading by institutional investors, trading arrangements more suitable to these investors have developed. Institutional investors' needs include trading in large size and trading groups of stocks, both at a low commission and with low market impact. These requirements resulted in the evolution of special arrangements for the execution of certain types of orders commonly sought by institutional investors: (1) orders requiring the execution of a trade of many shares of a given stock and (2) orders requiring the execution of trades in many different stocks as simultaneously as possible. The former types of trades are called block trades; the latter are called program trades. An example of a block trade would be a mutual fund that seeks to buy 15,000 shares of Apple Inc. stock. An example of a program trade would be a pension fund that wants to buy shares of 200 companies at the end of a trading day.

The institutional arrangement that accommodates these two types of institutional trades is a network of trading desks of the major securities firms and other institutional investors that communicate with one another by means of electronic display systems and telephones. This network is referred to as the "upstairs market." Participants in the upstairs market play a key role (1) by providing liquidity to the market so that such institutional trades can be executed and (2) through arbitrage activities that help integrate the fragmented stock market.

Block trades On the NYSE, Rule 72 defines a block as either trades of at least 10,000 shares of a given stock or trades of shares with a market value of at least 200,000, whichever is less. For institutional investors, because the execution of large numbers of block orders places strains on the specialist system, the NYSE implemented special procedures to handle them. Typically, an institutional customer contacts its salesperson at a brokerage firm, indicating that it wishes to place a block order. The salesperson then gives the order to the brokerage firm's block execution department. It should be noted that the salesperson does not submit the order to be executed to the exchange where the stock might be traded or, in the case of an unlisted stock, try to execute the order on the Nasdaq system.

The sales traders in the block execution department then contact other institutions to attempt to find one or more institutions that would be willing to take the other side of the order. That is, they use the upstairs market in their search to fill the block trade order. If the sales traders cannot find enough institutions to take the entire block (e.g., if the block trade order is for 30,000 shares of Apple Inc., but only 25,000 can be "crossed" with other institutions), then the balance of the block trade order is given to the firm's market maker. The market maker must then decide how to handle the balance of the block trade order. The brokerage firm can take a position in the stock and buy the shares for its own account. Or the unfilled order can be executed by using the services of competing market makers. In the former case, the brokerage firm is committing its own capital.

NYSE Rule 127 states that if a member firm receives an order for a large block of stock that might not be readily absorbed by the market, the member firm should nevertheless explore the market on the floor, including, where appropriate, consulting the specialist as to the specialist's interest in the security. If a member firm intends to cross a large block of stock for a public account at a price that is outside the current quotation, it should inform the specialist of its intention.

NYSE block volume is facilitated by upstairs traders, but it is not the case that all block trades are facilitated by upstairs trading desks and then brought to the floor to be printed. There is a difference between upstairs-facilitated trades and block trades. A block trade is defined by its size, not by the method of execution. Although negotiation in the informal upstairs market provides better execution than does execution in the downstairs market (i.e., on the NYSE trading floor) for large trades, these differences are economically small.

Program trades Program trades involve the buying or selling large numbers of stocks simultaneously. Such trades are also called basket trades, because effectively, a "basket" of stock is being traded. The NYSE defines a program trade as any trade involving the purchase or sale of a basket of at least 15 stocks with a total value of 1 million or more.

The two major applications of program trades are asset allocation and index arbitrage. With respect to asset allocation trades, some examples of why an institutional investor may want to use a program trade are to deploy new cash into the stock market; to implement a decision to move funds invested in the bond market to the stock market, or vice versa; and to rebalance the composition of a stock portfolio because of a change in investment strategy. For example, a mutual fund money manager can move funds quickly into or out of the stock market for an entire portfolio of stocks through a single program trade. All these strategies relate to asset allocation.

Program trading is also used for a strategy called index arbitrage. In chapter 33, we will discuss futures contracts traded on stock indexes, called "stock index futures." In chapter 35, we will discuss how the price of a futures contract derives from the underlying cash product. In the case of a stock index futures contract, the underlying cash product includes all of the stocks making up the stock index. Specifically, a mathematical relationship exists between the price of the stock index and the value of the stocks included in the index, taking into account transaction costs and the cost of borrowing funds. This relationship establishes bounds for the price of the stock index futures contract. When the price of the stock index futures contract moves outside these bounds, an opportunity arises for riskless profits to be obtained by trading the stocks in the index and the futures contract.

Unfortunately, the popular press often uses the terms "program trading" and "index arbitrage" interchangeably, which is incorrect. One is an investment strategy (index arbitrage), and the other is an institutional trading arrangement (program trading), even though a program trade is necessarily employed to implement an index arbitrage.

Another confusion is worth noting. Because computers are used to execute a program trade, the popular press often wrongly characterizes program trading as computerized trading. Program trading does not have to be, and generally is not, computer initiated. Sometimes computer algorithms facilitate the decision process, and almost always computers help route the trade to each individual stock in the program, but traders make the decisions and implement them.

High-Frequency Trading

One of the most significant market developments in recent years, according to the SEC, is high-frequency trading (HFT). HFT is a form of trading that leverages high-speed computing, high-speed communications, tick-by-tick data, and technological advances to execute trades in as little as milliseconds. High-speed trading strategies use computerized quantitative models (i.e., algorithms) that identify which stocks to buy or sell, as well as the quantity, price, timing, and location of the trades. HFT was first applied to the stock market. Today, however, it is also used in the bond market and the derivatives markets. Our focus here is on its use in the stock market. The SEC estimates that HFT is typically more than  $50\%$  of the total volume in U.S.-listed equities, concluding that "by any measure, HFT is a dominant component of the current market structure and likely to affect nearly all aspects of its performance."

There is no universally accepted definition of HFT. Martin Wheatley, chief executive officer of the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong and former deputy chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, defines HFT as "the execution of trading strategies based on computer programmes or algorithms to capture opportunities that may be small or exist for a very short period of time."1 Four characteristics that Wheatley identifies as being associated with HFT are (1) a high volume of trades on a daily basis, with a low level of profits per trade; (2) an extremely short stock holding period; (3) the submission of numerous orders; and (4) no significant open position overnight. How to quantify these characteristics is a matter of debate. One proposed definition is to define high-frequency traders (HFTers) as those traders who hold positions between 10 milliseconds and 10 seconds.12 Execution times are often expressed in microseconds. However, the SEC adopts a somewhat less precise definition, defining HFTers as professionals acting in a proprietary capacity and able to generate many trades per day.

There is considerable controversy over HFT's impact on financial markets in terms of the cost of trading to investors. Two events brought the issue of HFT to the forefront of the investing public's and regulators' attention. The first was the severe market disruption that occurred on May 6, 2010, as a result of HFT, known as the "flash crash." On the afternoon of that trading day, the major stock market indexes (as well as the stock index futures contracts, described in chapter 33) had declined by  $4\%$  relative to their closing price on the prior trading day. This decline came about because of the news at the opening of trading about the European debt crisis. In a matter of minutes, the stock market index dropped by  $5\%$  to  $6\%$ . But that loss was not sustained. Almost as quickly, the market rebounded, ending the trading day with a loss of  $3\%$  from the prior trading day.[13] The descriptor "flash" used to describe the crash refers to the fact that the orders placed were flash orders (i.e., orders that are executed immediately or withdrawn if not executed immediately).

The second was the publication in March 2014 of Michael Lewis's book *Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt*, dealing with HFT, which concluded that the stock market is rigged by HFT investors. This set off a barrage of criticisms of Lewis and other opponents of HFT because of their failure to understand the wide range of trading activities in which HFT is used. This is not to say that the concerns over certain types of trading strategies used by HFTers were not legitimate. However, a blanket statement about the adverse market impacts of HFT per se reflected a failure to understand the various uses of HFT. As noted by BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset management firm, in a position paper on HFT, some of these uses are constructive in the market: They have a legitimate purpose and provide benefits to market participants. Other users of HFT deploy it "to manipulate the market or disadvantage end-investors." BlackRock refers to such use as "predatory" HFT, stating that these "practices constitute market abuse and should be treated as such in law."[14]

How does HFT differ from what we referred to as "program trading," discussed earlier? Both use algorithmic trading with no human intervention.

The difference lies in the use of algorithmic trading by an institutional investor for orders that are so large that, if executed at one time, they would have an excessive price impact. That is a legitimate use of rapid, algorithmic trading. A computer algorithm in that case merely breaks up the order into many smaller orders, which are fed into the marketplace over time. The SEC recognizes that "these large order algorithms should not be classified as HFT because they typically enable institutional investors to establish or liquidate positions with time horizons far beyond the primarily intraday horizons characteristic of HFT."

HFT is engaged in by a wide variety of entities, including electronic market makers, proprietary desks, hedge funds, and institutional investors. Many of these firms are privately held proprietary trading firms or hedge funds. The biggest players in HFT reportedly include the electronic market makers and the proprietary trading desks of large banks. The technology goal of HFTers is to reduce latency (i.e., delay) in placing, filling, confirming, or canceling orders; the business goal is typically to profit from small arbitrage opportunities present at short time horizons.

The SEC classifies HFT strategies according to strategy:

- Passive market-making strategy: A passive market-making strategy primarily involves the submission of orders by electronic market makers that cannot be executed immediately, because the order seeks a price better than that available in the market. Such orders provide liquidity to the marketplace at specified prices. As such, they are quite different from flash orders and do not depend on the direction of the market.
- Arbitrage strategies: Arbitrage strategies generally seek to capture pricing disparities between related products or markets. An example is index arbitrage, described earlier, in which an investor seeks to capture pricing discrepancies between the cash equity market and stock index futures market. These strategies depend on the convergence of prices rather than on directional price movements.
- Structural trading strategies: Structural trading strategies seek to exploit structural vulnerabilities in the market. An example is a trader who has access to lowto lowest-latency market data and computer algorithms and who can profit by trading with market participants on a trading venue that is offering executions at stale prices.
- Directional trading strategies: Such strategies generally entail taking a long or a short position in the market in anticipation of a directional price movement (i.e., either an up or a down movement). There are two types of directional strategies: (1) an order anticipation strategy, which seeks to uncover the existence of large buyers or sellers in the marketplace and then front-run those trades in anticipation that those large orders will move market prices, and (2) a momentum ignition strategy, which seeks to create a rapid price movement by initiating a series of orders and trades.

BlackRock, for example, regards the use of HFT for passive market making a type of HFT that "brings tangible benefits to our clients through tighter spreads and by delivering intermediation in a fragmented trading landscape."[16] In this chapter, we have already described the need for arbitrage activities to maintain an efficient market. The concerns surrounding HFT have mostly to do with directional trading and structural trading strategies. A structural trading strategy in which HFTers use information advantages obtained from special access to market data is the best example of a predatory HFT strategy. Many of the directional trading strategies, as the SEC notes, are not new. Instead, it is the technology that gives HFTers pursuing directional trading strategies the opportunity to better identify and execute trading strategies. Even prior to HFT, front-running (using order-anticipation strategies) and market manipulation (using momentum-ignition strategies) were illegal.

The failure of lawmakers to understand the various types of HFT strategies and program trading strategies has led to proposals to impose regulations to limit the impact of HFT. One such proposal that is most often suggested as an effective way to limit the impact of HFT entails the imposition of a financial transaction tax. The problem with such a tax is that by attempting to mitigate the potential impact of predatory HFT, it would significantly reduce trading volume, liquidity, and price discovery, thereby dramatically affecting all market participants. Some have argued that one effective way to reduce the adverse impact of predatory HFT already exists: the use of circuit breakers, which we discussed in chapter 22.

One way to address the speed-advantage issue available to HFTers relative to other investors is by providing access to data centers and co-location at a reasonable cost. Co-location is one of the tools used by proprietary firms that engage in HFT. To further reduce latency, HFTers place their trading servers at the trading venues to be close to the exchange matching engines. This is commonly referred to as "co-location." Carol Clark, a financial markets and payments system risk specialist in the Chicago Federal Reserve's financial market group, remarks that it is estimated that for each 100 miles the server is located away from the matching engine, 1 millisecond of delay is added to the time it takes to transmit trade instructions and execute matched trades or to access the central order book, where information on buy/sell quotations and current market prices is warehoused. A trading venue that operates its own data centers, as well as third parties that host matching engines of trading venues, offer co-location as a service. For example, the NYSE completed a nearly 400,000-square-foot data center facility in Mahwah, New Jersey, to attract in co-location large Wall Street banks, traditional brokerages, and hedge funds. The center's 40 gigabyte per second standard hardware will allow it to handle up to a million messages a second; new trading technology will reduce latency to 10 microseconds. The SEC is undertaking an analysis of the impact of co-location on long-term investors and market quality.

A survey paper by Charles Jones at the Columbia Business School delivered the following conclusion about HFT:

Based on the vast majority of the empirical work to date, HFT and automated, competing markets improve market liquidity, reduce trading costs, and make stock prices more efficient. Better liquidity lowers the cost of equity capital for firms, which is an important positive for the real economy. Minor regulatory tweaks may be in order, but those formulating policy should be especially careful not to reverse the liquidity improvements of the last twenty years.[17]

# Key Points
- Common stock is typically classified based on market capitalization; the three most common classes are small, medium, and large market capitalizations.
- In addition to market capitalization, a universe of common stocks can be classified as either value or growth stocks based on their price-to-book value ratio.
- Stock market indexes can be classified into two groups: (1) those produced by stock exchanges and include all stocks to be traded on the exchange, and (2) those for which a committee subjectively selects the stocks to be included in the index.
- Some indexes represent a broad segment of the stock market, whereas others represent a particular sector, such as technology, energy (oil and gas), and financials.
- Three forms of pricing efficiency follow according to what is hypothesized to be the relevant information embodied in the price of a stock at all times: (1) weak form, (2) semi-strong form, and (3) strong form.
- Most of the empirical evidence appears to suggest that markets are efficient in the weak form.
- The evidence for the semi-strong form of market efficiency is mixed because of observed pockets of inefficiency. Empirical tests of strong-form pricing efficiency also produce conflicting results.
- Paul Samuelson's dictum asserts that the stock market is "micro efficient" but not necessarily "macro inefficient."
- Common stock investment strategies can be classified into two general categories: active strategies and passive strategies.
- Active strategies attempt to outperform the market by one or more of the following: timing the selection of transactions, such as in the case of technical analysis; identifying undervalued or overvalued stocks using fundamental security analysis; or selecting stocks according to market anomalies.
- The optimal strategy to pursue when the stock market is perceived to be price efficient is passive indexing, because it allows the investor to capture the efficiency of the market.
- Smart beta is an alternative low-cost passive strategy that has been suggested for capturing the risk premiums in the stock market that cannot be captured by market capitalization-weighted indexes.
- A core-satellite strategy is a hybrid of the pure passive and pure active approaches.
- According to the random walk hypothesis, at any time, it cannot be determined whether prices will increase or decrease during the next period.
- Different types of orders may be submitted to the stock markets.
- The most common type of order is a market order—an order that must be filled immediately at the best price.
- Other types of orders, such as stop and limit orders, are filled only if the market price reaches a price specified in the order.
- For a flash order, the trade must be executed immediately or withdrawn if not executed immediately. These orders are used by certain types of high-frequency traders.
- Several components of costs are associated with trading.
- Although a brokerage commission is the most obvious type of trading cost and the object of competition among broker-dealers for both institutional and retail investors, other types of trading costs may exceed the brokerage commission. Such costs include impact costs and opportunity costs.
- Block trades are trades of 10,000 shares or more of a given stock or trades with a market value of 200,000 or more.
- Program trades, or basket trades, involve the buying or selling of large numbers of names (stocks) simultaneously. The institutional arrangement developed to accommodate these needs is the upstairs market, which is a network of trading desks of the major securities firms and institutional investors that communicate with one another by means of electronic display systems and telephones.
- Buying on margin is a transaction in which an investor borrows to buy shares using the shares themselves as collateral.
- In a margin transaction, the funds borrowed to buy the additional stock are provided by the broker, and the investor is charged the call money rate or broker loan rate to borrow the funds.
- Institutional investors have developed automated computer programs to enter trading orders to minimize the costs associated with trading. The use of computer programs for this purpose is known as algorithmic trading.
- Trading costs can be decomposed into explicit costs and implicit costs.
- Explicit trading costs are the direct costs of trading, such as broker commissions, fees, and taxes.
- Implicit trading costs represent such indirect costs as the price impact of the trade and the opportunity costs of failing to execute in a timely manner or at all.
- The main explicit cost is the commission paid to the broker for execution.
- Implicit trading costs include impact costs, timing costs, and opportunity costs
- The impact cost of a transaction is the change in market price resulting from supply/demand imbalances caused by the trade.
- Timing cost is measured as the price change between the time the parties to the implementation process assume responsibility for the trade and the time they complete the trade; it is the result of orders remaining on the trading desk of an investor that have not yet been released to the broker because the trader fears that the trade may swamp the market.
- Opportunity cost is the "cost" of securities not traded as a result of missed trades or only partially completed trades.
- Explicit trading costs are often the smallest components of trading costs.
- Because of the significant increase in trading by institutional investors, trading arrangements more suitable to these investors developed: block trading and program trades.
- Block trading and program trades allow institutional investors the opportunity to trade in large size and trading groups of stock at a low commission and with low market impact.
- Block trades allow for orders requiring the execution of a trade of many shares of a given stock.
- Program trades allow for orders requiring the execution of trades in many different stocks as simultaneously as possible.
- High-frequency trading (HFT) is a form of trading that leverages high-speed computing, high-speed communications, tick-by-tick data, and technological advances to execute trades in as little as milliseconds using computerized quantitative models (i.e., algorithms) that identify which stocks to buy or sell, as well as the quantity, price, timing, and location of the trades.
- Four characteristics of HFT are (1) a high volume of trades on a daily basis with a low level of profits per trade, (2) an extremely short stock holding period, (3) the submission of numerous orders, and (4) no significant open position overnight.
- There is considerable controversy over HFT's impact on financial markets in terms of the cost of trading to investors.
- The SEC classifies HFT strategies into four categories: passive market-making strategies, arbitrage strategies, structural trading strategies, and directional trading strategies.
- Latency means "speed" and refers to the time it takes to complete an execution. HFTers refer to latency in milliseconds and even microseconds.

12. The following quotation is taken from Wayne H. Wagner:

When a trader decides how to bring an order to the market, he or she must deal with some very important issues; to me, the most important is: What kind of trade is this? It could be either an active or a passive trade. The type of trade will dictate whether speed of execution is more or less important than cost of execution. In other words, do I want immediate trading (a market order); or am I willing to forgo the immediate trade for the possibility of trading less expensively if I am willing to "give" on the timing of the trade (a limit order)?

a. What is meant by a "market order"?

b. Why would a market order be placed when an investor wants immediate trading?

c. What is meant by a "limit order"?

d. What are the risks associated with a limit order?

18. The following statements are taken from Greta E. Marshall's article in the proceedings of a conference held in New York City on December 3, 1987:

There are three components of trading costs. First there are direct costs which may be measured—commissions. Second, there are indirect—or market impact—costs. Finally, there are the undefined costs of not trading.[19] a. What are market impact costs, and what do you think the "undefined costs of not trading" represent?

Market impact, unlike broker commissions, is difficult to identify and measure.

b. Why is market impact cost difficult to measure?

19. The following statement appears in a report to the Joint Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues, September 30, 2010:

Generally, a customer has a number of alternatives as to how to execute a large trade. First, a customer may choose to engage an intermediary, who would, in turn, execute a block trade or manage the position. Second, a customer may choose to manually enter orders into the market. Third, a customer can execute a trade via an automated execution algorithm, which can meet the customer's needs by taking price, time or volume into consideration. Effectively, a customer must make a choice as to how much human judgment is involved while executing a trade.[20]

Explain each of these alternatives for executing a large trade.

20. Charles Schwab, chairman of the brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corporation, came out with the following statement in support of the conclusion in Michael Lewis's book Flash Boys that markets are rigged because of high-frequency trading: "High-frequency trading is a growing cancer that needs to be addressed." He concluded that HFT "is a technological arms race designed to pick the pockets of legitimate market participants," and "a scam … that [regulators] should simply make illegal." Explain whether you agree or disagree with this statement.
21. In an invited editorial appearing in The Journal of Portfolio Management, the founder of Vanguard, John Bogle, made the following two statements about Michael Lewis's book Flash Boys.

a. Explain whether you agree or disagree with the following statement.

Flash Boys, by best-selling author Michael Lewis, regaled the financial community with its polemic on the rise of HFT. "The stock market is rigged," Lewis told the huge television audience watching 60

Minutes, without explaining precisely what that meant. "Wall Street has gone insane," he intoned to the Guardian, which described his view that his calling is "a moral crusade." But he seems to have largely ignored the vital role of HFT in reducing the frictional costs of trading to minuscule levels. Lewis is particularly strident on the harm HFT does to ordinary individual investors. But it is here that he seems most clearly wrong. Yes, he sees lots of smoke in HFT, but finds the most fire is where that smoke is virtually absent. Retail investors who trade for themselves are beneficiaries of the new trading environment, with lower trading costs and faster market access.[21]

# b. What are the "well-founded concerns" that Mr. Bogle refers to in the following statement?

HFT is a long way from perfection. There are well-founded concerns—and heated arguments pro and con—about front-running by insiders (based largely on knowledge of pending transactions); huge volumes of cancelled orders (from HFT firms, as well as others); those mysterious dark pools; and outlandish profits earned by HFT firms.

A recently developed concept, "active share," is a metric that is the percentage difference between the individual holdings of a portfolio and its benchmark; it has been used to measure the degree of difference from the index.
