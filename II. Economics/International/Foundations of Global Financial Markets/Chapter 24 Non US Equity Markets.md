## Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

- The motivation for investors investing outside their domestic stock market;
- What the major changes in global exchanges in the past two decades have been;
- The major non-U.S. stock market indexes;
- The U.K. and European stock market regulatory systems;
- The implications of the United Kingdom's Big Bang;
- The structure and regulation of the Chinese stock market;
- The three major stock exchanges in China—Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong—and their differences;
- The role of state-owned enterprises in the development of the Chinese economy and in the Chinese stock market; and
- The differences between A-shares, B-shares, and H-shares traded on the Chinese stock exchanges.

In the previous two chapters, our focus was on the various aspects of the U.S. equity markets. We complete this three-chapter suite with a treatment of the non-U.S. equity markets. This chapter begins with a review of the non-U.S. equity markets—developed, emerging (developing), and frontier (pre-emerging) markets. Because the Chinese equity markets are relatively young but are very large, growing quickly, and quite complicated, we discuss the Chinese equity markets in more detail.

Although non-U.S. equities have become a large component of the investment portfolio of many institutional investors, retail (individual) investors can also invest in these markets. As can be seen in table 24.1 below, North America (the United States and Canada) represented approximately 44\% of the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) Global All Cap Index as of April 30, 2017. Most individual investors do not typically trade non-U.S. stocks directly but instead obtain exposure via collective vehicles that invest in individual countries or regions (such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) and depositary receipts (ADRs and GDRs).

## Rationale for Investing Outside the Home Equity Market

Investors have a choice of investing solely in their home equity market or expanding their portfolio to include the stocks of companies outside their home market. For example, a French investor can invest solely in stocks of French companies and traded in the French stock market or can invest in not only French companies but also in companies trading in other European countries, Asian companies, and North American companies. Why do investors bother to invest outside their home equity market? There are several reasons for doing so.

The major reason that is often cited is that investing in the companies outside their home market is diversification. Recall our discussion in chapter 13, where we described the Markowitz efficient frontier and how that efficient frontier impacted the correlation between assets. The argument for investing outside the home market is that the stock market return correlations are less than one and therefore, there is the opportunity to "push out" the efficient frontier. "Pushing out the efficient frontier" means that a given level of expected return can be achieved at a lower level of risk. Economists have argued that this is a "free lunch." Whether they are right is an empirical question. Some studies support correlation levels between country stock market returns that can produce this outcome. However, other studies show that as the world has become more integrated, correlations have approached one, particularly during a financial crisis.

The second rationale is that there are different levels of market efficiency in different countries. Hence, although the home equity market may or may not offer the opportunity to obtain superior returns due to market inefficiency, there are countries that may be far less efficient.

However, investing outside one's home market opens an investor to other issues that must be considered, such as liquidity, taxation, and other types of risk (specifically, different credit risks, country risk, and currency risk).

## Non-U.S. Equity Markets

Table 24.1 shows the composition of the global equity markets according to a well-known global stock market index, the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) Global All Cap Index, as of April 30, 2017.

As explained in chapter 1, countries and their equity markets are typically divided into three categories: developed, emerging (developing), and frontier (pre-emerging). The differences among these three types are based mainly on two factors: the development of their economies and the development of their capital markets. Their economic development refers mainly to their per capita income and their potential growth. Developed countries have higher levels of per capita income but lower potential growth. The development of their capital markets refers to the size of their market capitalization, the level of liquidity, and the development of their supporting regulatory and legal bodies. These characteristics affect the growth potential, risk, and liquidity of investments in their markets. Developed countries are found mostly in North America, Western Europe, and Australasia, including the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.

An emerging (developing) market is a country that has some of the characteristics of a developed market but not all of them. Developing countries include the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China); and the PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain). As shown in table 24.1, emerging market companies comprise $8.9\%$ of the FTSE Global All Cap Index, with $2.2\%$ in China, $1.5\%$ in Taiwan, $1.2\%$ in India, and $4.0\%$ in other emerging markets. Notice that North America (the United States and Canada) represents $56.1\%$ of the global equity market, the other developed countries (Europe and the Pacific) represent $34.8\%$, and emerging market countries represent $8.9\%$. The Middle East represents the final $0.22\%$.

A frontier or pre-emerging market is one that is too small and undeveloped to be considered an emerging market. These markets are smaller, less liquid, and less accessible than emerging markets, but nevertheless "investable." These markets tend to have high expected long run returns and low correlations with other markets. There are 21 markets that MSCI considers frontier markets, as shown in table 24.2.

Overall, less-developed countries have higher risks and higher potential returns, not an unusual trade-off when investing in financial markets.

There are several methods for classifying stock markets. In this chapter, we use the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) market classification, which is a family of indexes constructed and maintained by that organization. Its structure and current data are provided in table 24.2. MSCI's broadest index is the MSCI ACWI Index (ACWI stands for "All Country World Index"). As shown, this broad index is divided into the categories of developed markets, emerging markets, frontier markets, and standalone markets. Each is further divided into geographical regions. In general, the emerging market sector has been grouped in several different ways. The most commonly used grouping is the BRIC group. These four countries were thought to be of similar levels of development. Subsequently, South Africa was added to this group to form the BRICS. Interestingly, as of year-end 2017, China was the second largest global stock market but remains a developing market.

Table 24.3 provides basic data on the 20 largest global equity exchanges.. Global equity data on a frequent basis (daily or weekly) are found for many countries, exchanges, and sectors in the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, The Economist, and Bloomberg.

## Stock Market Indexes

Stock market indexes are provided in all global countries and exchanges. In every country where stock trading takes place, at least one index measures general share price movements on the domestic exchange. If a country has more than one stock exchange, each exchange usually has its own index. Non-exchange financial institutions also provide stock market data as explained in chapter 22 News organizations and financial advisory services create and distribute indexes.

Here we review exchange-provided stock indexes for four countries: Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Chinese stock indexes are described later in this chapter.

Japan has two major stock indexes. The Tokyo Stock Exchange produces the Tokyo Stock Price Index, or TOPIX. This composite index is based on all shares in the Tokyo market's First Section, a designation reserved for established and large companies whose shares are most actively traded and widely held. The TOPIX is computed based on the included firm's market cap. The second major Japanese index is sponsored by the financial information firm, Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc., which also calculates and publishes the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. This average, computed in the same way as the Dow Jones 30, is based on the prices of 225 of the largest companies in the First Section.

The U.K.'s London Stock Exchange (LSE) is covered by several widely followed indexes, all created by the Financial Times. The Financial Times is a daily international newspaper based in London and owned by Nikkei Inc. in Tokyo, Japan. The most popular is the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100 Index), often called the "Footsie," which is a market value index that commonly includes the shares of the largest 100 U.K. firms, whose market value makes up most of the market value of all U.K. equities. The other indexes are the FTSE 350 Index (which combines the 350 largest U.K. firms), the FTSE Small Cap Index, and the FTSE All-Share Index (which is the aggregation of the largest U.K. stocks plus the stocks in the FTSE Small Cap Index).

The primary German stock index is the DAX, which stands for Deutscher Aktienindex, produced by the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The German name for this exchange is the Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse. Some financial services regularly refer to the exchange by its initials, FWB. The DAX is based on the 30 most actively traded shares listed on the Frankfurt exchange. The FAZ index is another popular German index. Compiled by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which is a daily newspaper, the FAZ index is computed from the share prices of the 100 largest companies listed on the Frankfurt exchange.

In France, a national association of stockbrokers and the Paris Bourse produce an index based on the shares of 40 large and prominent firms traded on the exchange. The index is known as the CAC 40 Index after the name of the bourse's electronic trading system. Given the increasing economic integration of Europe, the CAC 40, the FTSE 100, and the DAX are all regarded as reliable indicators of the overall performance of European stocks and markets.

## Non-Exchange Sponsors of International Indexes

To meet the increased interest in global equity investing, global non-exchange financial institutions have developed several respected international stock indexes.

The MSCI provides families of U.S. and international stock indexes. The international global equity indexes followed by most institutional investors is the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and Far East) Index. The MSCI is divided into the MSCI Global Standard Indexes, MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes, and MSCI Value and Growth Indexes. The components in the MSCI database have been used to create more than 28,000 indexes. The MSCI World Index is a common benchmark for the global stock market. They are market-cap weighted. Table 24.2 lists the equity indexes provided by MSCI, divided into developed markets, emerging markets, frontier markets, and standalone markets. These indexes are widely used by institutional investors. There are also growth and value versions of these indexes.

The Financial Times has also created a series of global stock market indices: FTSE All-World Index Series, FTSE Emerging Markets, FTSE Global Equity Index Series, FTSE Global Sector Index Series, FTSE Global Small Cap Index Series, FTSE Global Style Index Series, FTSE Gold Mines Index Series, FTSE Multinationals Index Series, FTSE Shariah Global Equity Index Series, and FTSE Watch List Index Series. This series of indexes is also widely used.

### Regulation of the U.K. and European Stock Markets

It is not possible here to provide a detailed discussion of the regulation of the equity markets in the United Kingdom and Europe. Here we simply provide a brief discussion of the major events and legislation.

### Market in Financial Instruments Directive

The Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), promulgated in November 2007, provided significant changes in the European Union (EU) securities market regulatory infrastructure. Note that during 2007-2009, the period during which the global Great Recession occurred, significant reform also took place in the U.S. equities markets.

There are currently both similarities and differences between the U.S. (described in chapter 22) and EU financial regulations.[5] Both regulatory systems attempt to maintain fair and orderly markets, protect investors, and provide price transparency, although MiFID rules do not apply to dark pools. There are two major differences. First, investor protection rules for the European Union are two-tiered between retail and professional investors; in the United States, the same regulatory scheme protects all investors (with some carve-outs for institutional investors). Second, in the United States, quotes and transaction data reported by the national exchanges are consolidated into a single system and disseminated to market participants. In contrast, in the European Union, quotes and trades are fragmented among multiple trading venues, and no consolidation is required.

On January 3, 2018, the European Union revised its MiFID rules to include MiFID II, which ensures that asset managers obtain value for trade research by unbundling what asset managers pay for investment research. According to these rules, asset managers will either have to pay for the research themselves or charge their customers for the research. U.S. investors who do business in the European Union or the United Kingdom will also be affected. The effects of these changes are projected to be significant.

Competition in the securities markets has increased in the European Union, but trading has become more fragmented, and liquidity has moved from the exchanges, raising the concern of "fragmented liquidity" that led to the adoption of Reg. NMS in the United States, as discussed in chapter 22.

In both regions, consolidation among exchanges has increased, and it seems that an increasing share of equity trading has moved to dark pools.

### The Big Bang

A strong impetus for regulatory change in Europe was the "Big Bang," which occurred in London in 1986. The Big Bang caused significant permanent changes in the U.K. market structure and mechanics. The changes included terminating fixed commissions and ending the distinction between stockbrokers and stockjobbers. Stockbrokers acted as agents for their clients on a commission basis. Stockjobbers ("jobbers") made markets; that is, they engaged in the purchase and sale of stocks for their own "books" and were, thus, principals in the markets. Jobbers thus provided liquidity to the markets. Prior to this change, brokers and jobbers had to be independent and not be part of a broader financial group. These restrictions were removed by the Big Bang.

These regulatory changes immediately changed the LSE from floor-based, open-outcry markets to screen-based, electronic trading markets. The LSE's rules went into effect on October 27, 1986. A surge in trading activity followed, but quickly thereafter, there was a complete change in market structure regarding electronic trading, and the LSE floor became empty as all the trading moved "upstairs," which means into offices off of the exchange floor. These changes pre-dated similar changes that occurred in many other global exchanges and eventually in the NYSE.

## Chinese Equity Markets

The Chinese equity markets are relatively young, and China is not currently considered a developed country, but rather a developing country. The Chinese stock market is very different from most other developed country global stock markets. It is driven by retail rather than institutional investors. According to NBC, roughly $85\%$ of trades are by retail investors.[6]

Chinese retail investors also tend to be very sensitive to risk—they sell on bad news and buy on good news more quickly than do institutional and retail investors in the United States. Retail investors are often considered to be "noise investors;" that is, they make buy and sell decisions without using fundamental data and often overreact to both good and bad news. Overall, China's retail investors are very active traders/speculators, not long-term investors. In addition, in China, most of the large-cap companies are owned by large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the retail investors gravitate to the smaller companies, making these smaller markets even more volatile. These factors account for the Chinese stock market being much more volatile than the U.S. market. For these reasons, market observers refer to the Chinese stock market as a "casino," with the price of companies bearing little connection to their underlying economic fundamentals.[7]

In general, it is commonly regarded that the following are major disadvantages of the Chinese equity markets. The first disadvantage is the short-term, speculative orientation of the investors. This results in substantial volatility of the Chinese equity markets, especially the unlisted markets (as discussed below) and its investors. The second is the absence of financial advisors to counsel retail investors. Retail transactions are conducted by banks, which do not provide financial advice. The third drawback is the lack of longer term institutional investors; that is, there are very few mutual funds (including index funds). Fourth is the opaque nature of the unlisted markets—which adds to volatility. The fifth disadvantage is the poor quality of the accountability-oriented policies for shareholder protection coupled with weak business practices, such as limited financial disclosure and insider transactions. Finally, Chinese government market intervention policies are not well developed and not well understood by investors. With respect to government intervention policies, for example, during the significant Chinese stock market decline of 2015, the major Chinese stock index, the CSI 300 (discussed below), declined from over 5,000 to below 3,000. In response, the Chinese government became more interventionist to contravene declining prices. Among the actions of the Chinese government took were actively encouraging investors to buy stock on margin and prohibiting institutions holding more than $5\%$ stakes in Chinese companies from selling their positions.

On the other hand, among the advantages of the Chinese equity markets are (1) its large size, (2) its rapid growth, and (3) the low correlation of the

Chinese equity markets with other international markets. Investors find these advantages compelling.

As the Chinese equity markets mature, the abovementioned disadvantages may moderate. Because the Chinese equity markets are very large, are growing rapidly, and have already have become major parts of many global portfolios, we conclude this chapter with a discussion of these markets.

### Chinese Stock Market Structure

The structure and workings of the Chinese equity markets are quite different from those of other international exchanges. This structure is shown in figure 24.1. As shown in the figure, about $30\%$ of Chinese stocks are listed on one of the three stock exchanges (Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen exchanges), and $70\%$ are not listed on an exchange. Stocks not listed on any of these exchanges are referred to as "unlisted," that is, not traded on any exchanges and traded only on private markets. The private markets are very active. Of the $30\%$ of listed stocks, about half are government-owned companies, referred to as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the other half are private companies. This mix between SOEs and private companies has changed over time. SOEs are discussed further below.

A unique aspect of the Chinese stock market is the SOEs. SOEs are legal entities that are fully or partially owned by the state and conduct commercial activities on behalf of the state. At the birth of the People's Republic of China in 1949, all businesses were SOEs. The Chinese government has sold many of its SOEs since the turn of the century. As of 2011, $35\%$ of business activity and $43\%$ of the profits in the People's Republic of China was due to companies in which the government had a majority ownership.[8] These SOEs are typically extremely large and most are located in Beijing.

SOEs have played an important role in the development of the Chinese economy. In the 1980s, SOEs (the state sector) accounted for 80\% of the Chinese economy. However, due to the rapid increase in the private economy, by 2017, SOEs accounted for only 20\% of the economy.

The Chinese stock market indexes capture only the listed markets, which are heavily state owned. The unlisted market is very large but is not represented in any of the indexes. This structure causes a concern about transparency.

Table 24.4 shows the Chinese stock exchanges. The Chinese stock exchanges collectively represent the second largest stock market in the world. China's market comprises the fifth, sixth, and eight largest stock exchanges in the world. Stocks traded on these exchanges are referred to as "listed" and "mainstream" stock exchanges.

<table><tr><td>Exchange</td><td>Size (by market cap; billion U.S. $)</td><td>World Ranking (in market cap)</td><td>Founded</td><td>Index</td></tr><tr><td>Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)</td><td>3,986</td><td>5</td><td>11/26/90</td><td>Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SH Comp)</td></tr><tr><td>Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK)</td><td>3,325</td><td>6</td><td>1891/1986</td><td>Hang Seng Index (His)</td></tr><tr><td>Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE)</td><td>2,285</td><td>8</td><td>12/1/90</td><td>Shenshen Stock Exchange Component Index (SZSE Component Index)</td></tr><tr><td>ChiNext (part of Shenzhen Exchange)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>10/23/09</td><td>----</td></tr></table>

The Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) also owns a technology exchange, ChiNext, founded on October 23, 2009. The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) is in general considered to be similar to the NYSE, which lists many large stocks, whereas the SZSE specializes in small cap and technology stocks and is considered to be similar to the Nasdaq.

The two mainland exchanges, Shanghai and Shenzhen, opened in 1990 as part of Deng Xiaoping's privatization program. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK) was formally set up in 1891, and a number of important developments occurred beginning in 1986. The two mainland Chinese stock exchanges, SSE and the SZSE, were founded in 1990.

The last column in table 24.4 shows the designations for the Chinese stock market indexes, which are discussed below. As explained above, only stock exchange-traded stocks are included in these indexes. This raises a concern about transparency.

Chinese currency China's official currency is called the renminbi (denoted by RMB). Renminbi translates to "the people's currency" in Mandarin. It was first issued in December 1948 with the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Although its official abbreviation is ¥, the common abbreviation is RMB.

The yuan is the base unit of account of the currency, which means that the currency is denominated in 1 yuan, 2 yuan, and so on. The yuan is denoted by ¥. An analogy with the U.S. would be between the unit of value of the Federal Reserve Note (a unit of value akin to the yuan) and the U.S. dollar (a currency akin to the renminbi). Prices are referred to in dollars, not Federal Reserve Notes.

In practice, however, they are fungible. The yuan is commonly used for international applications. The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times report the Chinese currency versus the U.S. dollar in yuan rather than RMB.

### Chinese Stock Market Regulations

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is an institution of the People's Republic of China. It is the main regulator of the securities industry in China. China's Securities Law, which became effective July 1, 1999, was the nation's first securities legislation. The responsibilities of the CSRC are mandated in the Securities Law, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Securities Investment Funds, and a series of related laws that have expanded the duties and powers of the CSRC. Several regulatory reforms have been enacted to support the movement toward a more market-based financial sector.

The CSRC's authorization to implement a centralized and unified regulation of China's securities market to ensure its lawful operation is granted by Chinese law. The CSRC oversees China's nationwide centralized securities supervisory system, with the power to regulate and supervise securities issuers, as well as to investigate and impose penalties for "illegal activities related to securities and futures." Its functions are similar to those of the SEC in the United States.

The CSRC's responsibilities include: (1) formulating policies, laws, and regulations concerning markets in securities and futures contracts; (2) overseeing issuing, trading, custody, and settlement of equity shares, bonds, and investment funds; and (3) supervising listing, trading, and settlement of futures contracts; futures exchanges; and securities and futures firms.

The CSRC performs a unified regulatory function over the securities and futures market of China, maintains an orderly securities and futures market, and ensures a legal operation of the capital market. CSRC is located in Beijing, China.

Split-share-structure reform Prior to April 2005, companies traded on China's stock markets followed a split share structure, whereby one-third of the shares were public stocks, which were freely traded, and two-thirds were SOEs, which were nontradable shares (NTS). The NTS contributed to both significant corporate governance problems and to a lack of incentives and manager responsibilities for the state-ownership structure of many enterprises, which it was believed contributed to the inefficiency and low productivity of the SOEs. These two types of shares had the same dividends and voting rights; they were distinguishable only by whether they could be traded and thus, by their liquidity.

The original reason for the existence of the NTS structure was that the main goal of the Chinese government in forming the stock market was to raise capital for its SOEs and yet retain control of these enterprises. Achieving these goals jointly required secondary market trading. The tradable shares were called "floating" shares; and the nontradable shares were called "nonfloating," state-owned, or "legal" shares. One-third of the shares were freely traded public stocks, and two-thirds were SOEs, which were not publicly traded.

This so-called split-share structure did not achieve its goals. The NTS did not trade efficiently. So, in April 2005, the CSRC adopted a reform called the "Split Share Structure Reform" (SSSR), whereby all NTS became tradable on the listed stock markets, that is, they became floating shares.

Due to these differences in liquidity, tradable shares had a greater value than the otherwise identical NTS. Thus, before the NTS began trading according to the SSSR, the holders of the tradable shares had to be compensated by the holders of the previous NTS for their differences in value. For this reason, nontradable shareholders negotiated a settlement with tradable shareholders which would apply when the NTS became tradable. Specifically, according to the reform proposal, the shareholders of the NTS compensated the tradable shareholders with approximately three additional shares per ten original shares when all their NTS shares became tradable.

In retrospect, the SSSR has provided a significant positive effect on the Chinese stock market. The quality and dependability of stock market pricing has improved significantly since the implementation of the SSSR. Specifically, an empirical study by the European Central Bank confirmed that the SSST benefited small stocks, stocks issues with poorer governance, and stocks with less liquidity. Neglected stocks also saw an increase in trading volume and prices.[10]

Overall, the SSSR implemented a reform which eliminated the NTS shares typically held by the state or by politically connected institutional investors. China's A-share market efficiency—liquidity and pricing—improved significantly after the SSSR was adopted. These SSSR reforms applied only to A-shares, not Band H-shares, as discussed below.

Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor Program The Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) is a program that permits certain licensed international investors to participate in China's mainland stock exchanges. The QFII program was launched by the People's Republic of China in 2002 to allow foreign investors access to its stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Prior to QFII, foreign investors were not able to buy or sell shares on China's stock exchanges because of China's tight capital controls. With the launch of the QFII program, licensed investors can buy and sell RMB-denominated "A" shares. Foreign access to these shares is limited by specified quotas that determine the amount of money that the licensed foreign investors are permitted to invest in China's capital markets. Thus, foreign investors benefit from an opportunity to invest in onshore China, which is otherwise often insulated from the rest of the world, and are subject to capital controls governing and movement of assets in and out of the country.

As of April 2012, the combined quota for the QFII program was set at 80 billion. The quotas are granted by China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and the quotas can be adjusted to reflect and respond to the country's economic and financial situation. The types of investments include listed A-share stocks (excluding foreign-oriented B-shares). To be approved as a licensed investor, certain qualifications must be met (qualifications depend on the type of investor, such as fund management companies and insurance companies). For example, fund management companies are required to have a minimum of five years of experience in assets management and must have managed at least 5 billion in securities assets.

The QFII program was instrumental in including A-shares in U.S. stock indexes by MSCI, as discussed below. MSCI is moving slowly to include A-shares in its indexes, because an investor has to be part of the QFII program to invest in A-shares, which sets limits on the amount investors can invest.

As indicated, QFII permits foreign investors to invest in China. The obverse of this is the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) program, which permits certain Chinese institutional investors (such as banks, funds, and investment companies) to invest in securities outside China. The QDII program in China was set up to provide the growing number of Chinese investors with a larger market where they could invest their funds. The Chinese stock markets were not always deep enough to provide sufficient investment markets. As an example, an institutional investor could be approved, according to QDII, to invest up to $50\%$ of its net assets into allowable foreign securities, as long as not more than $5\%$ was invested in any single security.

### Chinese Stock Exchanges

There are three major exchanges in the Chinese stock market: the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK), the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). The last two exchanges are often referred to as the "mainland" or "on-shore" stock exchanges. Figure 24.1 provides the designations for the Chinese stock exchanges and their corresponding indexes.

The SEHK is the sixth largest global stock exchange and Asia's third largest stock exchange, after the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange. The exchange has been very aggressive in introducing electronic trading. After introducing a computer-assisted trading system in 1986, it introduced its complete system in October 2000. A small physical trading floor still exists, but it accounts for less than $1\%$ of total trading volume. SEHK is entirely open to foreign investors.

The SSE is the fifth largest global stock exchange and the largest stock exchange in mainland China. It is a nonprofit organization operated by the CSRC. Stocks, funds, and bonds are all traded on the exchange, which has listing requirements including that a company must be in business and be earning a profit for at least three years before joining the exchange. SSE was established in 1990. SSE has a total of approximately 870 listed companies, 1,351 listed stocks (A-shares and B-shares) with \$2.78 trillion in market capitalization and a \$5.22 trillion stock turnover. The trading system is capable of processing and executing 180 million orders for A-share trading and four million orders for B-share trading on a daily basis.

The SZSE is the eighth largest global exchange, the third largest exchange in China, and the fourth largest exchange in Asia. The SZSE lists more than 1,500 companies, most of which are controlled by the Chinese government. The SZSE opened the ChiNext board, a Nasdaq-type exchange for technology start-ups, during October 2009. Founded in 1990, the SZSE operates a Main Board, a Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Board, a Growth Enterprise Board, and a stock transfer agent system. Recently, there have been 467 companies on the Main Board, 327 companies on the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Board, and 36 companies on the Growth Enterprise Board, with market capitalizations of approximately \$0.6 trillion, \$0.25 trillion, and 24.1 million, respectively.

### Chinese Stock Market Share Classes (A, B, and H)

Stock trading in China is often thought to be complicated, mainly due to its multiple classes and the rules for permitted types of investors for each class. Overall, as indicated above, Chinese stock trading occurs on three exchanges, the SEHK, SSE, and the SZSE. In addition, many Chinese stocks are unlisted: They do not trade on the exchanges but are traded on private markets (see figure 24.1). Listed companies (on these exchanges) in China fall into three primary share class categories: A-shares, B-shares, and H-shares.

For every stock listed on either the SSE or the SZSE, two share classes are listed: A-shares and B-shares. In general, A-shares are traded by mainland Chinese investors and B-shares by international investors.

A-shares are traded in yuan (RMB) and are available to all mainland Chinese investors; they are also available to foreign investors but only through a QFII program. A-shares were only available to mainland Chinese investors, but this restriction ended in 2013. Since then, QFII-licensed foreign institutions that have received a special permission by the Chinese government, can also participate in this A-share market, as discussed above.

B-shares are traded mainly among international investors. They are also available to mainland Chinese investors who have a legal foreign currency account. B-shares are quoted in U.S. dollars on the SSE and in Hong Kong dollars on the SZSE. B-shares are based on local Chinese companies. They have a face value in RMB. They are listed for trading primarily by international investors. However, B-shares are also open to domestic investors, provided that these investors set up a foreign currency account. B-shares are traded in U.S. dollars on the SSE and in Hong Kong dollars on the SZSE. Many companies list and trade their shares simultaneously on the SEHK and the mainland Chinese stock exchanges and thus offer two share classes, called "dual listing," as discussed below.

H-shares are shares of companies incorporated in mainland China, which are listed on the SEHK. Although they are regulated by the Chinese legal system, H-shares are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and are traded in the same way as the other stocks on the SEHK. Many companies list their shares on both the SEHK and one of the two mainland Chinese stock exchanges (dual listing), as discussed below.

The top part of table 24.5 summarizes the characteristics of A-, B-, and H-share classes. The bottom part of the table summarizes the availability of the three share classes to Chinese and U.S. investors.

### A-Shares versus H-Shares

Prior to 2013, A-shares were available only to mainland Chinese investors and were traded by Chinese investors (on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges). However, since 2013, QFII investors can also trade A-shares. H-shares can be traded freely by anyone (including mainland Chinese investors) with legal foreign currency accounts. Prior to 2007, Chinese investors could trade only A-shares (on the two mainland exchanges), not H-shares, even for stocks for which both A-shares and H-shares were listed.

Since 2007, China has allowed Chinese investors to invest in either A-shares or H-shares of companies that have H-shares listed on the SEHK. Different types of investors can own the A-shares (which trade on the two mainland exchanges) and the H-shares (which trade on the SEHK) of the identical, mainland stocks. As a result, very large price differences may occur between the two markets for two otherwise identical stocks. Spreads of $30\%$, $80\%$, and even $100\%$ between the two shares are observed. That is, A-shares may trade at large premiums to H-shares for these dual-listed stocks.

Despite these large spreads, there is no channel for arbitrage between the two markets. Among the reasons for the existences of these spreads are (1) large institutional foreign investors invest in H-shares, and the institutions are better at assessing value and are not as speculative; (2) there is a large imbalance between the supply of and demand for high quality stocks in China due to market segmentation; and (3) restrictions/regulations combined with high demand increase the premiums for A-shares.

The number of dual listings (that is, the same stock being listed on a mainland exchange and on SEHK) is small. There were less than 100 dually listed stocks in early 2017.

Red chips A red chip company is a company based in mainland China that is incorporated internationally and listed on the SEHK. Red chip stocks are expected to maintain the filing and reporting requirements of the SEHK, which makes them a main outlet for foreign investors who wish to participate in the rapid growth of the Chinese economy. Red chips may be issued in addition to A-shares of the same companies, although only Chinese citizens can invest in the A-shares (unless the investor is part of a QFII program).

Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect Stock Connect is an investment channel that connects SSE and SEHK, so that investors in each market can trade shares on the other's market using their local brokers and clearing houses. This "connection" was the first link between the mainland and Hong Kong for a broad range of investors. This program began in November 2014. A similar link, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, began in December 2016 and connects SZSE and SEHK. These links are used mostly by institutions. For individuals to use these links they must demonstrate that they are sophisticated investors by having a minimum level of assets and passing a test. It may be necessary, however, for individuals to go to Hong Kong and open an account with a local broker. Only A-shares are included in these stock connects, not B-shares.

### Chinese Stock Market Indexes

The Chinese stock market indexes are based entirely on listed stocks, that is, stocks listed on one of the exchanges. The listed stocks are approximately 50\% based on SOEs and 50\% based on private stocks. Unlisted stocks are traded in very active markets and are not traded on any exchange. The major stock indexes in China are the Hang Seng Index, the Shanghai Composite Index, the Shenzhen Component Index, and the CSI 300 Index.

The Hang Seng Index (His) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted stock market index traded on the SEHK. The 50 constituent companies of the His represent about 58\% of the capitalization of the SEHK. The index is used to record and monitor daily changes of the largest companies. The His was started in November 1969 and is currently compiled and maintained by Hang Seng Indexes Company Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hang Seng Bank. The 50 His stocks are also divided into four subindexes: finance, utilities, properties, and commerce and industry

The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE Comp) is a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the price performance of all the A-shares and B-shares listed on the SSE. The index was developed on December 19, 1990 with a base value of 100.

The Shenzhen Composite Index (SZSE Composite Index), the major index of SZSE, is an index of 500 stocks traded on this exchange. It is a capitalization weighted index that was developed on April 3, 1991.

The CSI 300 is free-flat market cap-weighted index of 300 A-share stocks that are listed on the two mainland stock exchanges. The index was established in April 2005. It is compiled by the China Securities Index Company Ltd. It is divided into 10 subindexes: energy, materials, industrials, consumer discretionary, consumer stables, health care, financial, information technology, telecommunications, and utilities.

A recently constructed Chinese stock index is the S&P China 500, which is based on 500 of the largest, most liquid Chinese companies. Its composition approximates the sector composition of the broader Chinese equity market. The Chinese A-share classes and offshore listings are eligible for inclusion. The index is calculated via weighting by the float-adjusted market cap. This index is one of a family of S&P Dow Jones Indexes.

U.S. stock index sponsors are increasingly including stocks traded on Chinese exchanges in their indexes. For example, in July 2017, MSCI began including China A-shares in the relevant MSCI indexes (MSCI China Index, MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and others), which includes A-share stocks listed on the Shanghai-listed and Shenzhen-listed shares in this index. This change added 222 Chinese A-shares from both the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. Prior to this, MSCI Emerging Markets Index and other related indexes included only Chinese stocks which were not A-shares: for example, Alibaba (which trades on the NYSE) and China Mobile (which trades on the Hong Kong exchange). The inclusion of A-shares in the MSCI Indexes supports a greater institutional investor base for these Chinese stocks. To be included in U.S. indexes, non-Chinese investors have to be eligible to buy A-shares by being eligible through the QFII, as discussed above.

### Chinese vs U.S. Equity Markets

Let's compare the Chinese equity market to the U.S. equity market. Both have quite a long history. The year each Chinese stock exchange was established is shown in table 24.4. The Shanghai Stock Exchange dates back to the 1860s and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange began in 1891 and then reopened in 1986. In the United States, the New York Stock Exchange was founded in 1792.

A large share of stock trading in the United States is by institutions, while most trading in the Chinese stock market is done by retail traders. As noted earlier, Chinese exchanges are often likened to casinos. While U.S. companies are heavily dependent on equity financing, Chinese companies are much more dependent on bank loans and retained earnings.

The U.S. equity markets are much more open to foreign investors than Chinese equity markets. As discussed earlier, on Chinese equity exchanges A-shares are primarily traded among Chinese investors on the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges; B-shares are primarily traded by non-Chinese investors; and H-shares are open to both Chinese and non-Chinese investors.

With respect to investor participation, the Chinese equity market structure is much more complicated than the U.S. market structure.
