As we have seen, financial markets can be classified in various ways. For example, there is the classification into equity markets versus debt markets according to the nature of the claim of the holder of the financial instrument. The cash market and the derivative markets differ, as explained in earlier chapters. As explained in chapter 1, for debt obligations, a distinction is made based on the maturity of the financial instrument. The two markets based on a maturity classification are the money market and the capital market. Financial instruments that at the time of issuance have a maturity of one year or less are referred to as money market instruments and the market they trade in is called the money market. In contrast, the capital market is the market where financial instruments with a maturity in excess of one year trade. Because equity has a perpetual maturity, it is part of the capital market.

Our focus in this chapter is on the money market. This market plays the following three vital roles in the financial system. First, it provides investors who want to invest in liquid assets a market where they can do so. Second, it provides those entities in need of liquidity a market where they can borrow. Third, the money market provides central banks globally an avenue through which they can implement monetary policy by influencing the availability and cost of liquidity.

In this chapter, we describe the various private money market instruments traded in the money market. By "private money market instruments," we mean instruments issued by nongovernmental entities: nonfinancial and financial corporations. Private money market instruments include unsecured loans made between banks, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, large-denomination negotiable certificates of deposit, banker's acceptances, and money market funds.

What is important in reviewing private money market instruments is not just the first role cited above—that is, the appeal of the various instruments from the perspective of an investor—but also the last two roles. As we have mentioned frequently in this book, liquidity is an important issue for financial and nonfinancial corporations. When we described in chapter 2 government bailouts during the recent financial crisis as well as historically, the problem encountered by the entity needing assistance was liquidity. Indeed, liquidity was the chief culprit in the financial crisis that began in 2007, which then caused a global recession in 2008–2009. Private money market instruments must be purchased by investors willing to accept the associated credit risk. Since the recent financial crisis, major shifts have occurred in the structure and regulation of the money market. These changes are highlighted in this chapter.

## Interbank Funding Market

Prior to the financial crisis that began with the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007, the most immediate liquidity source for banks was the interbank funding market (also referred to as the interbank lending market). As the name indicates, this is the market where banks lend funds to one another, although there is some participation in this market by nondepository institutions. Two types of lending take place between banks in this market: unsecured and secured lending. In the unsecured sector of the market, lending is done through the federal funds market. In the secured sector, lending is done through repurchase agreements that we describe later in this chapter; this sector is referred to as the repo market.

In the financial market, the interbank funding market was the most liquid sector during normal market conditions. Certain events have stressed this market. For example, the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, resulted in disruptions in communications and reporting systems such that demand by banks for liquidity increased substantially. However, within a few days, the market had returned to its normal functioning. In contrast, the 2008-2009 global recession caused such disruptions in the interbank funding market that questions arose about the future viability of parts of this market. In fact, one of the key problems that characterized the financial crisis from 2007 on was the problems faced in the interbank funding market. Understanding the reasons for these problems is important for understanding the growing importance of other sectors of the money market (i.e., the private money market instruments) that we describe in this chapter. This is because the entire structure of the money market has changed as a result of the changes in the interbank funding market since the financial crisis.

The eurocurrency market is the market for deposits operating under a different regulatory apparatus than for deposits used for making domestic transactions. One prominent example is bank deposits denominated in British pounds sterling in banks outside the United Kingdom. The "euro" in "eurocurrency" is a misnomer. These markets have origins in Europe. Today the term refers to any currency held in deposits offshore. Another example is an international banking facility. These facilities allow depository institutions in the United States to provide banking services to nonresidents and are not be subject to the U.S. regulations that restrict the behavior of banks. International banking facilities are free from some Federal Reserve requirements (see chapter 6).

There is a parallel structure in the provision of banking services—onshore and offshore. Onshore refers to the traditional domestic market. Offshore refers to eurocurrency. As noted, eurocurrency is any currency on deposit in banks outside their country of origin. These deposits are traded in the eurocurrency market. The source of these deposits is large financial institutions and corporations. Interbank interest rates are rates that large financial institutions charge one another for loans.

Interbank Lending Rates

Federal funds rate and central bank interest rates In the United States, transactions of depository institutions with either another depository institution or an eligible nondepository entity that involve one party making an unsecured loan to the other party takes place in the federal funds market (or fed funds market). The average interest rate at which these fed funds transactions take place in the market is referred to as the federal funds rate or fed funds rate. Using daily data on federal funds transactions voluntarily supplied by major brokers in the fed funds market to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (New York Fed), a measure of the overnight fed funds rate is computed each day. This rate is called the daily federal funds effective rate.

As explained in chapter 6, banks must maintain reserves at their local Federal Reserve Bank. At one time, no interest was paid by the Federal Reserve Banks on the reserves deposited with them. These deposited reserves have two components. The first is required reserves and the second is excess reserves (i.e., the amount of reserves that exceeds required reserves). In 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks began paying interest on reserves because of the ongoing financial crisis. The Federal Reserve Banks pay a different interest on required reserves and excess reserves. The rate paid on required reserves is called the interest on reserves, and the rate paid on excess reserves is called the interest on excess reserves (IOER). The Fed's objective in paying interest on reserves was to eliminate the opportunity cost faced by banks when funds were tied up in the form of reserves. The purpose of paying IOER was linked to the Fed's ability to control the daily federal funds effective rate. In the fed funds market, excess reserves are traded (i.e., lent) to those banks that do not have sufficient deposits to satisfy required reserves. Before the payment of IOER by the Federal Reserve Bank, banks with excess reserves could lend those reserves at a market rate. With the Fed paying IOER, it became less appealing for a bank with excess reserves to lend those funds at a rate below the IOER.

The mechanism used by the Fed to influence the overnight fed funds rate so that the rate set in the market was close to the target level for the overnight fed funds rate that was established by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is as follows. Through open market operations, the Fed changes the supply of reserves in the market and, in combination with

IOER, the overnight fed funds rate is affected such that it is within the range of the target level established by the FOMC.

The federal funds reserve rate is the rate the Federal Reserve establishes. Central banks in other countries establish a similar interest rate. Table 25.1 lists the names of various central banks and their interest rates.

Unsecured interbank offered rate benchmarks The U.S. fed funds rate is not a market-determined rate that reflects unsecured borrowing by banks in the interbank funding market. Instead, the fed funds rate is an artificial rate whose target level is determined by the Federal Reserve. In contrast, there is an interbank funding rate at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis outside the United States in the London money market. That rate is the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR).

LIBOR is not derived directly from actual unsecured loan transactions in the interbank funding market. Instead, LIBOR is calculated based on responses to a daily market survey by an administrator of this interest rate. Prior to 2014, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) was the administrator of this rate. In early 2014, the responsibility of administrating LIBOR was shifted to the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and LIBOR is now referred to as "ICE LIBOR."

To calculating LIBOR, a panel of large banks estimates the interest rate at which it could borrow on the interbank market for seven different maturities: overnight (one day), one week, one month, two months, three months, six months, and 12 months. Moreover, LIBOR is calculated for five different currencies: the U.S. dollar (USD LIBOR), the British pound sterling (GBP LIBOR), euros (EUR LIBOR or Euribor), the Japanese yen (JPY LIBOR), and the Swiss franc (CHF LIBOR). ICE's official LIBOR values for each maturity and each currency, abbreviated as shown here, are announced by Thomson Reuters once a day.

The Euro Overnight Index Average is the average overnight Euribor. It is compiled as an average of rates charged by 35 contributing banks on overnight unsecured loans denominated in euros. The contributing banks include EU banks and large international banks from non-EU countries that are part of the Eurozone.

Understanding how the official LIBOR for each maturity and currency is calculated is important. Every panel bank reports to Thomson Reuters at 11 a.m. London time every working day the interest rate at which it would expect to be able to raise a substantial loan in the interbank money market at that time. Because not every panel bank borrows a substantial amount for each maturity (or any maturity, for that matter) every day, the calculation is not based on actual loan transactions. From the rates reported by the panel banks, Thomson Reuters eliminates the lowest and highest $25\%$ and then averages the remaining reported rates to obtain the official LIBOR for a given maturity and currency.

LIBOR is a key interest rate, because it is used as a reference interest rate for an estimated 360 trillion of derivative contracts. Moreover, it is used to set rates on commercial business loans, consumer loans, and mortgage loans for residential and commercial property. Consequently, LIBOR is viewed as the most important benchmark interest rate in the global financial market. As such, its calculation is extremely important for all participants in the financial market.

The current issue regarding LIBOR is whether this survey-based borrowing cost truly reflects interbank funding costs, particularly during periods of market distress, such as the 2008-2009 financial crisis. During this period, little trading took place in the interbank funding market in London. Consequently, many market participants questioned the official suite of rates reported by the BBA when it was the administrator for LIBOR.

In 2012, several stories in the press reported that some panel banks had submitted false information used to calculate LIBOR. It was alleged that certain panel banks had intentionally underestimated the rate at which they estimated they could borrow funds overnight from other banks. The reason for underestimating the borrowing rate is that had this not been done, it would have increased the cost for overnight loans, signaling that the financial condition of the bank submitting the information was deteriorating. Subsequent investigations of the survey process for computing LIBOR by regulators in several countries confirmed the manipulation of LIBOR by some panel banks. This LIBOR-rigging scandal led to the filing of lawsuits against the panel banks alleged to have been involved. Several banks have settled these suits. In the United Kingdom, the BBA agreed to transfer oversight of LIBOR to regulators in that country based on the recommendation of an independent review committee headed by Martin Wheatley, managing director of the U.K. Financial Services Authority.

The interest rate on unsecured lending plays an important role in global financial markets. For this reason, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) prepared a report in 2014 titled Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks. The report made two recommendations. The first recommendation involved enhancing prevailing interest rate benchmarks for key interbank offered rates in the unsecured lending markets. These key interbank offered rates are referred to as the "IBORs." The second recommendation was for promoting the development and adoption of interest rates that reflected nearly risk-free benchmark rates. In July 2015, the FSB published a report titled Progress in Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks as an interim report describing the implementation of the recommendations that were made in the 2014 report. After the July 2015 interim report, the group responsible for IBOR took further steps toward implementing the recommendations in the 2014 FSB report, which was to improve the interest rate benchmarks for unsecured lending. It did so by adopting a methodology to obtain whenever possible rates based on transaction data to avoid the problems discussed earlier with LIBOR.

Future of the interbank funding market During the financial crisis that began with the subprime mortgage crisis in mid-2007, severe disruptions took place in the interbank funding market. Some observers have argued that the market froze, and furthermore, some believe the market will not recover.

The 2008-2009 financial crisis caused an increase in the demand for highly liquid assets. U.S. bank managers preferred to pursue a strategy of maintaining liquid assets that might be needed if the crisis worsened rather than make loans that would be illiquid assets on their balance sheets.[7] In addition, bank management preference shifted to very short-term, high-credit-quality secured loans. The preference for the type of collateral for secured loans changed from the pre-crisis period. In lending transactions with other banks and financial institutions, bank management preferred liquid assets. That is, in a lending arrangement such as a repurchase agreement (to be discussed later in the chapter), collateral could be, for example, a short-term financial instrument of high credit quality or a pool of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with impaired credit history. Banks preferred the former types of loans to the latter.

Consequently, the economic and financial conditions resulted in an environment in which banks were conservative in the amount they lent in order to maintain highly liquid assets on their balance sheets, and when secured loans were made, collateral that was of high credit quality with high liquidity was preferred. Moreover, loans with a short maturity were preferred. Because of the reduction in the supply of interbank loans, borrowing costs increased significantly. This resulted in a vicious cycle, leading to further conservative policies by bank management that increased the demand for liquidity, a reduction in the amount of loans, and a further increase in borrowing costs. For example, prior to the month when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, loans between U.S. commercial banks reached a peak of  \$494 billion in September 2008. After the bankruptcy filing, loans between U.S. banks fell to\$ 153 billion.[8] It was not until the federal government took the actions we described in chapter 2 that the cycle was broken, but concerns remained that the interbank funding market might not be relied on to provide liquidity in the future.

Several studies have provided empirical support for the freezing of the interbank funding market globally. For example, Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick found that in the repo market, bank policies that involved increasing the amount of collateral required effectively caused a run in the repo market, particularly for loans involving low-credit-quality assets.[9] A different conclusion about the survival of the interbank lending market is provided in a study by Gara Afonso, Anna Kovner, and Antoinette Schoar, who investigated the response of the fed funds market to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.[10] They found that the average amount of borrowing was stable, even though the fed funds rate increased significantly and the terms of the lending agreements became more sensitive to the risk characteristics of the borrowing bank. They argue that the market did not freeze, but also that it did not expand to meet the increased demand by banks needing liquidity.

## Repo Market

A repurchase agreement (or simply repo) is the sale of a security with a commitment by the seller to buy the security back from the purchaser at a specified price at a designated future date. Basically, a repurchase agreement is a collateralized loan where the collateral is a security or a pool of assets. The collateral in a repo can be money market instruments, Treasury securities, federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, or a pool of loans. As noted in our discussion of the interbank funding market, repurchase agreements were used by banks to make loans to other banks.

A repo agreement is best explained with an illustration. Suppose a securities dealer purchases \$10 million of a particular bond issue. Where does the dealer obtain the funds to finance that position? Of course, the dealer can finance the position with its own funds or by borrowing from a bank. Typically, however, the dealer uses the repo market to obtain financing. In the repo market, the dealer can use the \$10 million of the bond issue as collateral for a loan. The term of the loan and the interest rate that the dealer agrees to pay (referred to as the repo rate) are specified. When the term of the loan is one day, it is called an overnight repo; a loan for more than one day is called a term repo.

The transaction is referred to as a repurchase agreement because it calls for the sale of the security and its repurchase at a future date. Both the sale price and the repurchase price are specified in the agreement. The difference between the purchase (repurchase) price and the sale price is the dollar interest cost of the loan.

In our illustration, the dealer needs to finance \$10 million par value of the bond that it purchased and plans to hold overnight. Suppose that a customer of the dealer has excess funds of \$10 million. The dealer would agree to deliver (i.e., sell) \$10 million of the bond to the customer for an amount determined by the repo rate and buy (i.e., repurchase) the same bond from the customer for \$10 million the next day. Suppose that the overnight repo rate is 3.5\%. Then (as explained below), the dealer would agree to deliver the bond for \$9,999,027.78 and repurchase the same bond for \$10 million the next day. The \$972.22 difference between the sale price of \$9,999,027.78 and the repurchase price of 10 million is the dollar interest on the financing. From the customer's perspective, the agreement is called a reverse repo.

The following formula is used to calculate the dollar interest on a repo transaction:

Dollar interest = Dollar principal × Repo rate × Repo term/360.

Notice that the interest is computed on a 360-day basis. In our example, at a repo rate of $3.5\%$ and a repo term of one day (overnight), the dollar interest is $\$972.22$, derived as follows:

Dollar interest = 10,000,000 \times 0.035 \times 1/360 = \$972.22

The advantage to the dealer of using the repo market for borrowing on a short-term basis is that the rate is less than the cost of bank financing. We explain why later in this section. From the customer's perspective, the repo market offers an attractive yield on a short-term secured transaction that is highly liquid.

The example illustrates financing a dealer's long position in the repo market, but dealers can also use the repo market to cover a short position. For example, suppose a government dealer sold 10 million of Treasury securities two weeks ago and must now cover the position—that is, deliver the securities. The dealer can do a reverse repo (agree to buy the securities and sell them back). Of course, the dealer eventually would have to buy the Treasury security in the market to cover its short position.

A good deal of Wall Street jargon is used to describe repo transactions. To understand it, it is useful to remember that one party is lending money and accepting a security as collateral for the loan; the other party is borrowing money and providing the lender collateral for the loan. When someone lends securities in order to receive cash (i.e., borrows money), that party is said to be "reversing out" securities. A party that lends money with the security as collateral is said to be "reversing in" securities. The expressions "to repo securities" and "to do repo" are also used. The former means that someone is going to finance securities using the security as collateral; the latter means that the party is going to invest in a repo. Finally, the expressions "selling collateral" and "buying collateral" are used to describe a party financing a security with a repo, on one hand, and lending on the basis of collateral on the other.

Despite the high-quality collateral typically underlying a repo transaction, both parties to the transaction are exposed to credit risk (i.e., counterparty risk). Even prior to the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the failure of a few small government securities dealer firms who were parties to repo transactions in the 1980s made market participants more cautious about the creditworthiness of the counterparty to a repo.[11]

Why does credit risk occur in a repo transaction? Let's consider our illustration in which the dealer uses 10 million of government securities as collateral for this borrowing. If the dealer cannot repurchase the government securities, the customer may keep the collateral. If interest rates on government securities increase subsequent to the repo transaction, the market value of the government securities declines, and the customer owns securities with a market value less than the amount it lent to the dealer firm. If the market value of the security rises instead, the dealer firm will be concerned with the return of the collateral from the counterparty, which then has a market value higher than the loan.

Repos are now more carefully structured to reduce credit risk exposure. The amount lent is less than the market value of the securities used as collateral, which provides the lender with some cushion should the market value of the securities decline. The amount by which the market value of the securities used as collateral exceeds the value of the loan is called the "margin" or "haircut." The amount of margin varies with the type of collateral, such as its liquidity and the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Another practice used to limit credit risk is to mark the collateral to market on a regular basis. Recall that the practice of marking to market means recording the value of a position at its market value. When the market value changes by a certain percentage, the repo position is adjusted accordingly. Suppose that a dealer firm borrows  \$20 million using collateral with a market value of\$ 20.8 million, so that the margin is 4\%. Suppose further that the market value of the collateral drops to \$20.1 million. A repo agreement can specify either a margin call or repricing of the repo. In the case of a margin call, the dealer firm is required to put up additional collateral with a market value of \$700,000 to bring the margin up to 800,000. If repricing is agreed on, the parties to the transaction adjust the amount of the collateral in the transaction to the correct margin level. The dealer then sends the customer sufficient funds so that the loan's new amount is in line with the collateral's market value.

One concern in structuring a repo is delivery of the collateral to the lender. The most obvious procedure is for the borrower to deliver the collateral to the lender. At the end of the repo term, the lender returns the collateral to the borrower in exchange for the principal and interest payment. This procedure may be too costly, though, particularly for short-term repos, because of the costs associated with delivering the collateral.

The cost of delivery is factored into the transaction in the form of a lower repo rate offered by the borrower. The risk of the lender not taking possession of the collateral is that the borrower may sell the security or use the same security as collateral for a repo with another party.

As an alternative to delivering the collateral, the lender may agree to allow the borrower to hold the security in a segregated customer account. Of course, the lender still faces the risk that the borrower may use the collateral fraudulently by offering it as collateral for another repo transaction.

Another method is for the borrower to deliver the collateral to the lender's custodial account at the borrower's clearing bank. The custodian then takes possession of the collateral, which it holds on behalf of the lender. This practice reduces the cost of delivery, because it is merely a transfer within the borrower's clearing bank. If, for example, a dealer enters into an overnight repo with customer A, the next day the collateral is transferred back to the dealer. The dealer can then enter into a repo with customer B for, say, five days without having to redeliver the collateral. The clearing bank simply establishes a custodian account for customer B and holds the collateral in that account. This arrangement is called a tri-party agreement.

With this understanding of repos, we can appreciate the run in the repo market that Gorton and Metrick report occurred in the interbank funding market during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. During the crisis, banks raised the amount of the haircut on repos, particularly when the collateral was illiquid, low-credit-quality assets, such as a pool of subprime mortgage loans. To see the impact of increasing the haircut, consider once again a dealer firm that borrows \$20 million using collateral with a market value of \$20.8 million and a margin of 4\%. The proceeds received by the borrower come to \$20 million. Suppose that at the end of the term, the lender wants a 10\% margin rather than 4\%. Then for collateral of \$20.8 million, the margin or haircut would be $18,909,091 ($20.8 million/1.10) instead of \$20 million. That is, \$1,090,909 less in proceeds will be received by the dealer firm from the repo agreement. Now suppose that the dealer firm in our illustration is a bank and is using the repo market to obtain funds. Hence, the bank will receive 1,090,909 less in proceeds as a result of a higher haircut, which, as argued by Gorton and Metrick, is effectively a run on the repo market.

## Participants in the Market

Because it is used by dealer firms (investment banking firms and money center banks acting as dealers) to finance positions and cover short positions, the repo market represents one of the largest sectors of the money market. Financial and nonfinancial firms participate in the market as both sellers and buyers of collateral, depending on the circumstances they face. Depository institutions (commercial banks and thrifts) are typically net sellers of collateral (i.e., net borrowers of funds); money market funds (MMFs), bank trust departments, municipalities, and corporations are typically net buyers of collateral (i.e., providers of funds).

Even though banks and dealer firms use the repo market as the primary means for financing inventory and covering short positions, they also use the repo market to run a matched book by taking on repos and reverse repos with the same maturity. A dealer firm uses a matched book to capture the spread at which it enters into the repo and reverse repo agreements. For example, suppose that a dealer firm enters into a term repo of 10 days with an MMF and a reverse repo with a thrift for 10 days in which the collateral is identical. In this transaction, the dealer firm borrows funds from the MMF and lends money to the thrift. If the repo rate is $3.5\%$ and the reverse repo rate is $3.55\%$, the dealer firm borrows at $3.5\%$ and lends at $3.55\%$, locking in a spread of $0.05\%$ (five basis points).

Another participant is the repo broker. To understand the role of the repo broker, suppose a dealer firm shorts 50 million of a security. It then surveys its regular customers to determine whether it can borrow by means of a reverse repo the security it shorted. Suppose that it cannot find a customer willing to do a repo transaction (a repo from the customer's point of view, a reverse repo from the dealer's). At that point, the dealer firm uses the services of a repo broker.

The Federal Reserve is also involved in the repo market. The Fed influences short-term interest rates through its open market operations, that is, by the outright purchase or sale of government securities. This practice is not commonly followed by the Fed, however. Instead it uses the repo market to implement monetary policy by purchasing or selling collateral. By buying collateral (i.e., lending funds), the Fed injects money into the financial markets, thereby exerting downward pressure on short-term interest rates. When the Fed buys collateral for its own account, it is called a system repo. The Fed also buys collateral on behalf of foreign central banks in repo transactions referred to as customer repos. It is primarily through system repos that the Fed attempts to influence short-term rates. By selling securities from its own account, the Fed drains money from the financial markets, thereby exerting upward pressure on short-term interest rates. This transaction is called a matched sale.

Note the language used to describe the transactions of the Fed in the repo market. When the Fed lends funds based on collateral, we call it a "system" or "customer repo," not a "reverse repo." Borrowing funds using collateral is called a "matched sale," not a "repo." The jargon is confusing, which is why we used the terms "buying collateral" and "selling collateral" to describe what parties in the market are doing.

## Determinants of the Repo Rate

Repo rates vary from transaction to transaction, depending on the following factors:

- Quality. The higher the credit quality and liquidity of the collateral are, the lower the repo rate will be.
- Term of the repo. The effect of the term of the repo on the rate depends on the shape of the yield curve.
- Delivery requirement. As noted earlier, if delivery of the collateral to the lender is required, the repo rate will be lower. If the collateral can be deposited with the bank of the borrower, a higher repo rate is paid.
- Availability of collateral. The more difficult it is to obtain the collateral, the lower the repo rate will be. To understand why, remember that the borrower (or equivalently, the seller of the collateral) may have a security that is a hot or special issue. The party that needs the collateral will be willing to lend funds at a lower repo rate to obtain the collateral. Collateral is classified as generic collateral and special collateral. Generic collateral refers to collateral that is readily available to borrow in the market. When the collateral is difficult to acquire, it is said to be special collateral (or hot collateral). The repo rate is less for special collateral than for generic collateral.

Although these factors determine the repo rate on a particular transaction, the federal funds rate determines the general level of repo rates. The repo rate will be below the federal funds rate, because a repo involves collateralized borrowing, whereas a federal funds transaction is unsecured borrowing.

Negative repo rates We discuss negative interest rates in chapter 16. Negative repo rates can occur in so-called normal markets, especially in Europe. When collateral becomes special collateral, this is an indication of exceptionally high borrowing demand in the repo market and, as a result, repo rates can become negative. This is more common in countries where the general level of interest rates is at or near zero. Another set of conditions that can induce negative repo rates is financial distress, which serves as a prime breeding ground for negative repo rates. During episodes of financial distress, even general collateral rates can turn negative due to high demand for these securities as safe havens. A negative repo rate means the cash lender pays repo interest to the cash borrower, because the repurchase price is less than the purchase price.

Suppose a customer has excess cash of €10,000,000 with no immediate use for the funds for two weeks. Also suppose a dealer wants to finance a €10,000,000 par value position in sovereign debt for two weeks. The repo margin is 2\%, and the repo rate is -0.25\%. The amount lent in this transaction is €10,000,000/1.02 or €9,803,921.57. This value is the purchase price. The repurchase price is the purchase price plus repo interest for two weeks. Repo interest is given by €9,803,921.57 × (-0.0025) × 14/360, or—€953.16. The repurchase price is €9,802,968.41. The following summarizes this repo when there are negative repo rates:

Purchase price €9,803,921.57 (€10,000,000/1.02)

Purchase date Day 1

Repurchase date Day 15

Repurchase price €9,802,968.41

Repo rate -0.25

Repo interest -€953.16 = €9,803,9212.57 × (-0.0025) × 14/360.

When repo rates are positive, there is an incentive for the dealer (i.e., the seller) to deliver collateral on the purchase date. A dealer failing to deliver the collateral will not receive the purchase price until the collateral is delivered. The dealer—regardless of whether the collateral is delivered—is obligated to pay the full amount of the repo interest to the customer (i.e., the buyer) on the repurchase date. Paying interest on cash not available for use provides a strong incentive to deliver the collateral. When repo rates are negative, the incentive to deliver the collateral on the purchase date is gone. In fact, negative repo rates reward failure of delivery, because the repurchase price is less than the purchase price.

## Commercial Paper Market

Commercial paper (CP) is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued in the open market that represents the obligation of the issuing corporation. The issuers of CP typically have a high credit rating. Both domestic and foreign corporations issue CP in the United States. CP issued by foreign entities is called a Yankee CP. MMFs purchase roughly one-third of all CP issued. Pension funds, state and local governments, and nonfinancial corporations seeking short-term investments purchase the balance. Little secondary trading of CP takes place. Typically, an investor in CP is an entity that plans to hold it until maturity, which is understandable, because an investor can purchase CP in a direct transaction with the issuer, who sells paper with the specific maturity that the investor desires.

The issuance of CP is an alternative to bank borrowing for large corporations with strong credit ratings. It is the largest short-term debt instrument issued in the financial market. The original purpose of CP was to provide short-term funds for seasonal and working capital needs, but companies use this instrument for other purposes. It has been used for bridge financing. For example, suppose that a corporation needs long-term funds to build a plant or acquire equipment. Rather than raising long-term funds immediately, the corporation may elect to postpone the offering until more favorable capital market conditions prevail. The funds raised by issuing CP are used until longer-term securities are sold. In the United States, the maturity of CP is typically less than 270 days, with most maturing in less than 90 days. Several reasons explain this pattern of maturities. First, the Securities Act of 1933 requires that securities be registered with the SEC. Special provisions in the 1933 act exempt CP from registration as long as the maturity does not exceed 270 days. Hence, to avoid the costs associated with registering issues with the SEC, firms rarely issue CP with maturities exceeding 270 days. Another consideration when determining the maturity is whether the CP would be eligible collateral for a bank borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window. To be eligible, the maturity of the paper may not exceed 90 days. Because eligible paper trades at a lower cost than paper that is not eligible, firms prefer to issue paper whose maturity does not exceed 90 days.

To pay off holders of maturing CP, issuers generally use the proceeds obtained by selling new CP. This process is often described as "rolling over short-term paper." The risk that the investor in CP faces is that the issuer will be unable to sell new CP at maturity and, as a result, unable to obtain financing to pay off the investors in the maturity CP. This risk is referred to as rollover risk. As a safeguard against rollover risk, CP issued in the United States is typically backed by unused bank credit lines. The commitment fee that the bank charges for providing a credit line increases the effective cost of issuing CP.

Credit rating agencies evaluate the credit risk of CP and assign a letter rating based on the likelihood of default. The ratings assigned to CP by Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch are shown in table 25.2.

## Issuers in the CP Market

The CP market is categorized by sector according to the type of issuer: financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). As shown in the following table, as of October 2017, in the United States there was U.S.  \$1,009.5 trillion of CP outstanding, according to the Federal Reserve. The breakdown between the various categories of commercial paper both domestic and foreign was (in billions of U.S. dollars):$ [13]

<table><tr><td colspan="3">Nonfinancial</td><td colspan="5">Financial</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>Domestic</td><td>Foreign</td><td>Total</td><td>Domestic</td><td>Foreign</td><td>Asset-Backed</td><td>Other</td></tr><tr><td>290.4</td><td>228.6</td><td>61.8</td><td>476.6</td><td>213.4</td><td>263.2</td><td>242.0</td><td>0.4</td></tr></table>

As we can see from the table above, financial entities are the dominant issuers of CP. Three types of financial companies issue CP: bank-related finance companies, captive finance companies, and independent finance companies. A bank holding company may have a subsidiary finance company that provides loans to enable individuals and businesses to acquire a wide range of products. Captive finance companies are subsidiaries of equipment manufacturing companies. Their primary purpose is to secure financing for the customers of the parent company. Independent finance companies are not subsidiaries of equipment manufacturing firms or bank holding companies.

The appendix to this chapter describes the asset-backed commercial paper market.

Although financial entities now dominate the issuance of CP, nonfinancial corporations dominated the CP market in the early years of its development. The major issuers were utility and transportation companies. By 1992, the financial sector dominated the market. At the beginning of the financial crisis, in mid-2007, the financial sector accounted for more than $92\%$ of CP issuance.[14]

Identifying the reasons for the shift in dominance from nonfinancial sector issuers to financial sector issuers has been the focus of several studies. One study found that the shift could be attributed to three factors.[15] The first factor was nonfinancial companies' aggressive pursuit of policies to reduce their holdings in inventory. As holdings declined, there was less need to obtain short-term borrowing (such as CP) to fund inventory positions. The second factor was an increased tendency of nonfinancial companies to take advantage of relatively low interest rates to issue long-term bonds. This corporate management financial strategy removed the uncertainty about the risk of having to refinance at future interest rates that might be higher. Finally, the credit quality of issuers decreased, and the tolerance of investors for credit risk also decreased.

This shift from nonfinancial issuers to financial issuers has important implications, particularly in light of the discussion of the future of the interbank funding market earlier in this chapter. In fact, some now argue that the CP market is the new interbank funding market.

Directly Placed versus Dealer-Placed Paper

CP is classified as either directly placed paper or dealer placed paper. Directly placed paper is sold by the issuing firm directly to investors without the help of an agent or an intermediary. (An issuer may set up its own dealer firm to handle sales.) Most issuers of direct paper are financial companies. These entities require continuous funds to enable them to provide loans to customers. As a result, they find it cost effective to establish a sales force to sell their CP directly to investors. General Electric Capital Corporation (GE Capital) is an example of a direct issuer, having issued CP for more than 50 years. GE Capital is the principal financial services arm of General Electric Company and is the largest and most active direct issuer in the United States.

Dealer-placed CP requires the services of an agent to sell an issuer's paper. CP agents are large securities dealer firms and subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Typically, nonfinancial companies and smaller financial companies use this avenue for issuing CP, because the amount and frequency at which they need to borrow cannot justify maintaining a sales force. The agent distributes the paper on a best-efforts underwriting basis (for more on best-efforts underwriting, see chapter 9) by investment banking firms.

## Tier 1 and Tier 2 Paper

A major investor in CP is MMFs, which we describe later. The SEC imposes restrictions on the investments made by these entities. Specifically, Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 limits the credit risk exposure of money market mutual funds by restricting their investments to "eligible" paper. Eligibility is defined in terms of the CP credit ratings shown in table 25.2. To be eligible paper, the issue must carry one of the two highest ratings (1 or 2) from at least two of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. Tier 1 paper is defined as eligible paper that is rated 1 by at least two of the rating organizations; Tier 2 paper security is defined as eligible paper that is not a Tier 1 security.

MMFs may hold no more than $5\%$ of their assets in the Tier 1 paper of any individual issuer and no more than $1\%$ of their assets in the Tier 2 paper of any individual issuer. Furthermore, holdings of Tier 2 paper may not represent more than $5\%$ of the fund's assets.

From its beginnings until 1970, the CP market grew continuously, with no real crisis. In June 1970, a major issuer of CP at the time, Penn Central Railroad, with 84 million outstanding, faced financial difficulties, which raised concerns in the CP market. Because of the importance of the CP market, the federal government provided assistance that permitted Penn Central to repay maturing CP. The plan failed, and one year, later Penn Central filed for bankruptcy.

Despite recessionary periods, the years that followed the Penn Central episode saw the market grow in terms of issuance, fostered by the growth in MMFs, which were the major investors in CP. It was not until 1982 that the market saw its first default since Penn Central, the default by Johns Manville Corporation.[16] That was followed by three defaults in 1989 and three more in 1990.[17] The defaults in 1989 prompted federal legislation to tighten the rules for the purchasing of CP by MMFs that we described earlier (i.e., SEC Rule 2a-7). Fast-forward to the fall of 2007: The subprime mortgage crisis in the United States brought down the growth of the ABCP market. As explained in the appendix to this chapter, this sector of the CP market provided funding for the issuance of securitized products, particularly subprime mortgage-backed securities that we describe in chapter 30. Failures in this market by issuers of ABCP closed down this market sector. Another key event in the CP market was the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. As a result of these events, by fall 2008, market participants were concerned about the ability of the CP market to survive, given the demands placed on it. Investors reallocated their short-term investments from the CP market to MMFs that held only government securities.

Because of the importance of this market, federal programs were enacted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Fed to address two potential problems caused by the failures in the CP market. The first problem was the concern that financial issuers of CP would not make timely payments to investors on their obligation at the maturity date and would thereby extend the maturity date. To deal with this concern, the Fed instituted several lending programs during the financial crisis, but the two principal ones dealing with the CP market were the Commercial Paper

Funding Facility and the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility, both created in September 2008. The programs involved the purchase by the Fed of CP, the first time in the Fed's history that it had been a purchaser of this type of asset. The Fed's participation, which began at the end of October 2008, stabilized the CP market. As a result of the Fed's participation, it became the largest single investor in CP by January 2009. The Fed held $22\%$ of outstanding CP at that time, but it subsequently reduced its holdings to $3.4\%$ by October 2009.[18]

The second problem lay in the potential impact on the major holders of commercial MMFs. As explained later, these collective investment vehicles are designed to maintain a net asset value (NAV) of 1. The concern was that these funds would suspend redemption of shares as a consequence of problems with their CP holdings. When we discuss MMFs later in the chapter, we will describe what the federal government did to address the second concern.

## Yields on CP

CP may be issued in either a discount form or an interest-bearing form. In a discount form, the investor buys the paper at less than face value and when it matures receives the face value. The difference between the face value and the purchase price is the interest. When the paper is issued in interest-bearing form, it is purchased from the issuer at face value and a specified interest rate. At maturity, the investor receives the face value plus the accrued interest based on the specified interest rate.

The yield offered on CP tracks that of other money market instruments. There are three reasons that the yield on CP is higher than that on short-term U.S. Treasury securities for the same maturity. First, the investor in CP is exposed to credit risk. Second, interest earned from investing in Treasury bills is exempt from state and local income taxes; as a result, CP must offer a higher yield to offset this tax disadvantage relative to Treasury bills. Finally, CP is less liquid than Treasury bills. The liquidity premium demanded may be small, however, because investors typically follow a buy-and-hold strategy with CP and so are less concerned with liquidity.

Non-U.S. corporations issue CP in the U.S. market, which, as noted earlier, is referred to as "Yankee CP." Other countries have developed their own CP markets for companies domiciled in their country and for foreign companies. For example, in Japan, CP can be issued by Japanese corporations in Japan's domestic market and yen-dominated CP can be issued by non-Japanese entities. The latter CP is referred to as Samurai CP. According to the Asian Development Bank, other Asian countries that issue CP are Malaysia and the Philippines. Although domestic commercial paper has developed in some European countries (especially in France, Spain, and the United Kingdom), the eurocommercial paper (ECP) market is the market of choice for many European CP issuers. ECP is short-term unsecured debt issued in Euromarkets with maturities of 1 to 360 days. As of June 2016, financial ECP was U.S.  \$325.73 billion, and corporate ECP stood at\$ 21.99 billion, according to the European Central Bank.

ECP is issued and placed outside the jurisdiction of the currency of denomination. U.S. CP and ECP differ with respect to the characteristics of the paper and the structure of the market. First, CP issued in the United States usually has a maturity of less than 270 days, with the most common maturity ranging from 30 to 50 days or less. The maturity of ECP can be considerably longer. The average maturity of ECP is about twice as long as U.S. commercial paper. Second, although an issuer in the United States must have unused bank credit lines, it is possible to issue ECP without such backing in the ECP market. Third, ECP sports a wider distribution of issuer credit quality. Unlike most U.S. CP, most ECP is not rated. Fourth, in the United States, CP can be directly placed or dealer placed, but ECP is almost always dealer placed. ECP is issued on a best-efforts basis through a syndicate of dealers. The fifth distinction is that numerous dealers participate in the ECP market, whereas only a few dealers dominate the market in the United States. Finally, because of the longer maturity of ECP, it is traded more often in the secondary market than is U.S. CP. Investors in CP in the United States typically buy and hold to maturity, and the secondary market is thin and illiquid.

A certificate of deposit (CD) represents a financial obligation issued by a depository institution that indicates a specified sum of money deposited at the issuing depository institution. Depository institutions issue CDs to raise funds for financing their business activities. A CD bears a maturity date and a specified interest rate. It can be issued in any denomination. CDs issued by a depository are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), but only for amounts up to 250,000 per account. CDs are not subject to any limit on the maximum maturity, but by Federal Reserve regulations, CDs cannot have a maturity of less than seven days.

A CD may be nonnegotiable or negotiable. In the former case, the initial depositor must wait until the maturity date of the CD to obtain the funds. If the depositor chooses to withdraw funds prior to the maturity date, an early withdrawal penalty is imposed. In contrast, a negotiable CD allows the initial depositor (or any subsequent owner of the CD) to sell the CD in the open market prior to the maturity date. The negotiable CDs purchased by institutional investors are large-denomination negotiable CDs that typically have a denomination of 10 million or more.

Our focus here is on the large-denomination negotiable CDs, and we refer to them simply as "CDs." The largest group of investors in such CDs consists of MMFs.

## CD Issuers

CDs can be classified into four categories, according to the issuing institution. First are CDs issued by domestic banks. Second are CDs denominated in U.S. dollars but issued outside the United States. These CDs are called Eurodollar CDs, or euro CDs. A third category of CD is the Yankee CD, a CD denominated in U.S. dollars and issued by a foreign bank with a branch in the United States. Finally, thrift CDs are issued by S&Ls and savings banks.

Money center banks and large regional banks are the primary issuers of domestic CDs. Most CDs are issued with a maturity of less than one year. Those issued with a maturity greater than one year are called term CDs.

Unlike Treasury bills, commercial paper, and banker's acceptances (discussed later), the yields on domestic CDs are quoted on an interestbearing basis. CDs with a maturity of one year or less pay interest at maturity. For purposes of calculating interest, a year is treated as having 360 days. Term CDs issued in the United States normally pay interest semiannually, again with a year taken as 360 days.

With a floating-rate CD, the interest rate changes periodically in accordance with a predetermined formula that indicates the spread (or margin) above some index at which the rate will reset periodically. Floating-rate CDs may reset the coupon daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or semiannually. Typically, floating-rate CDs have maturities of 18 months to five years.

Euro CDs are U.S. dollar-denominated CDs issued primarily in London by U.S., Canadian, European, and Japanese banks.

CD Yields

The yields posted on CDs vary, depending on three factors: (1) the credit rating of the issuing bank, (2) the maturity of the CD, and (3) the supply of and demand for CDs. With respect to the third factor, banks and thrifts issue CDs as part of their liability management strategy, so the supply of CDs will be driven by the demand for bank loans and the cost of alternative sources of capital to fund these loans. Moreover, bank loan demand depends on the cost of alternative funding sources, such as CP. When loan demand is weak, CD rates decline. When demand is strong, the rates rise. The effect of maturity depends on the shape of the yield curve, a topic we covered in chapter 16.

Credit risk is an important consideration, as the amount of the deposit of a large-denomination negotiable CD far exceeds the maximum FDIC insurance. At one time, domestic CDs issued by money center banks traded on a "no-name basis" (i.e., they offered a uniform yield regardless of the issuing money center bank). Recent financial crises in the banking industry, however, caused investors to take a closer look at issuing banks. Prime CDs (those issued by highly rated domestic banks) trade at a lower yield than nonprime CDs (those issued by lower-rated domestic banks). Because of investors' unfamiliarity with foreign banks, generally Yankee CDs trade at a higher yield than do domestic CDs.

Euro CDs offer a higher yield than domestic CDs for three reasons. First, the Federal Reserve imposes reserve requirements on CDs issued by U.S. banks that do not apply to issuers of euro CDs. The reserve requirement effectively raises the cost of funds to the issuing bank, because it cannot invest all the proceeds it receives from the issuance of a CD, and the amount that must be kept as reserves will not earn a return for the bank. Because it earns less on funds raised by selling domestic CDs, the domestic issuing bank pays less on its domestic CD than on a euro CD. Second, the bank issuing the CD must pay an insurance premium to the FDIC, which again raises the cost of funds. Finally, euro CDs are dollar obligations payable by an entity operating in a foreign jurisdiction, exposing the holders to a risk (referred to as "sovereign risk") that their claim may not be enforced by the foreign jurisdiction. As a result, a portion of the spread between the yield offered on euro CDs and domestic CDs reflects what can be termed a "sovereign risk premium." This premium varies with the degree of confidence in the international banking system.

CD yields are higher than yields on Treasury securities of the same maturity. The spread is due mainly to the credit risk that a CD investor is exposed to and the fact that CDs offer less liquidity. The spread resulting from credit risk varies with both economic conditions and confidence in the banking system, increasing during a "flight to quality" (which means investors shift their funds in significant amounts to debt of high quality or little risk) or a crisis in the banking system.

## Banker's Acceptances

A banker's acceptance (BA) is a financial instrument created to facilitate commercial trade transactions. This financial instrument is referred to as a BA because the issuing bank accepts the ultimate responsibility to repay a loan to the holder of the financial instrument. The use of BAs to finance a commercial transaction is referred to as acceptance financing, and BAs are accordingly sometimes referred to as "acceptances."

The transactions in which BAs are created include (1) the importing of goods into the United States, (2) the exporting of goods from the United States to foreign entities, (3) the storing and shipping of goods between two foreign countries where neither the importer nor the exporter is a U.S. firm,[19] and (4) the storing and shipping of goods between two entities in the United States. As demonstrated in the following illustration, maturities are typically arranged to cover the time required to ship and dispose of the goods being financed.

BAs are sold on a discounted basis, just as Treasury bills and CP are. To calculate the rate to be charged the customer for issuing a BA, a bank determines the rate for which it can sell its BA in the open market. To this rate it adds a commission.

Illustration of the Creation of a BA

The best way to explain the creation of a BA is by an illustration. Several entities are involved in our hypothetical transaction:

- Car Imports Corporation of American (Car Imports), a firm in New Jersey that sells automobiles;
- Germany Fast Autos Inc. (GFA), a manufacturer of automobiles in Germany;
- First Hoboken Bank (Hoboken Bank), a commercial bank in Hoboken, New Jersey;
- Berlin National Bank (Berlin Bank), a bank in Germany; and
- High-Caliber Money Market Fund, a mutual fund in the United States that invests in money market instruments.

Car Imports and GFA are considering a commercial transaction. Car Imports wants to import 15 cars manufactured by GFA. GFA is concerned with the ability of Car Imports to make payment on the 15 cars when they are received. Acceptance financing is suggested as a means for facilitating the transaction. Car Imports offers \$300,000 for the 15 cars. The terms of the sale stipulate payment to be made to GFA 60 days after it ships the 15 cars to Car Imports. GFA determines whether it is willing to accept the \$300,000. When considering the offering price, GFA must calculate the present value of the 300,000, because it will not be receiving payment until 60 days after shipment. Suppose that GFA agrees to these terms.

Car Imports arranges with its bank, Hoboken Bank, to issue a letter of credit. The letter of credit indicates that Hoboken Bank will make good on the payment of \$300,000 that Car Imports must make to GFA 60 days after shipment. The letter of credit, or time draft, will be sent by Hoboken Bank to GFA's bank, Berlin Bank. On receipt of the letter of credit, Berlin Bank will notify GFA, which will then ship the 15 cars. After the cars are shipped, GFA presents the shipping documents to Berlin Bank and receives the present value of \$300,000. GFA is now out of the picture.

Berlin Bank presents the time draft and the shipping documents to Hoboken Bank. The latter will then stamp "accepted" on the time draft. By doing so, Hoboken Bank creates a BA and agrees to pay the holder of this BA 300,000 at the maturity date. Car Imports receives the shipping documents so that it can procure the 15 cars once it signs a note or some other type of financing arrangement with Hoboken Bank.

At this point, the holder of this BA is the Berlin Bank. It has two choices. It can continue to hold the BA as an investment in its loan portfolio, or it can request that Hoboken Bank make a payment of the present value of  \$300,000. Let's assume that Berlin Bank requests payment of the present value of\$ 300,000.

Now the holder of this BA is Hoboken Bank. It has two choices: retain the BA as an investment as part of its loan portfolio or sell it to an investor. Suppose that Hoboken Bank chooses the latter, and that High-Caliber Money Market Fund is seeking a high-quality investment with the same maturity as that of the BA. Hoboken Bank sells the BA to the MMF at the present value of  \$300,000. Rather than sell the instrument directly to an investor, Hoboken Bank could sell it to a dealer, who would then resell it to an investor, such as an MMF. In either case, at the maturity date, the MMF presents the BA to Hoboken Bank, receiving\$ 300,000, which the bank in turn recovers from Car Imports.

## Accepting Banks

Banks that create BAs are called accepting banks. Banker's acceptances can be distributed through a dealer market, which involves 15 to 20 large firms, most of which are headquartered in New York City. The larger regional banks maintain their own sales forces to sell the BAs they create but will use dealers to distribute those they cannot sell.

## Eligible BAs

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve classifies a BA as either an eligible or an ineligible BA. The classification is important. There are two types of eligible BAs. The first is an eligible BA that a bank uses as collateral for a loan at the Fed's discount window. Regulation A of the Fed sets forth the eligibility requirements. The second type of eligible BA is one that the Federal Open Market Committee is permitted to purchase. Regulation B sets forth the eligibility requirements.

One requirement for eligibility is maturity, which, with a few exceptions, cannot exceed six months. Although the other requirements for eligibility are too detailed to review here, the basic principle is simple.[20] The candidate BA should be financing a self-liquidating commercial transaction.

Eligibility is also important because the Fed imposes a reserve requirement on funds raised by means of BAs that are ineligible. BAs sold by an accepting bank are potential liabilities of the bank, but no reserve requirements are imposed for eligible BAs. Consequently, most BAs satisfy the various eligibility criteria. Finally, the Federal Reserve also imposes a limit on the amount of eligible BAs that may be issued by a bank.

Although the Fed no longer purchases BAs as part of its open market operations, this has not always been the case. There is a history of the Fed's participation in the BA market dating back to the beginning of the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1916 with the goal of developing this sector of the money market to compete with the banks in London. At that time, the Fed actively discounted BAs and purchased eligible BAs. In fact, during one period in U.S. history, the Fed's open market policy involved the purchase of only BAs.[21]

## Credit Risk

Investing in BAs exposes the investor to the credit risk that neither the borrower nor the accepting bank will be able to pay the principal due at the maturity date. The market interest rates that BAs offer investors reflect this risk, because BAs have higher yields than risk-free Treasury bills. A yield may also include a premium for relative illiquidity. The yield on a BA has such a premium because its secondary market is far less developed than that of a Treasury bill. Hence, the spread between rates on BAs and rates on Treasury bills represents a combined reward to investors for bearing the higher risk and relative illiquidity of a BA. That spread is not constant over time. The change in the spread reveals shifting investor valuation of the risk and illiquidity differences between the assets.

## Money Market Funds

Now that we have described money market instruments, we conclude this chapter by discussing a major institutional investor that participates in the money market: MMFs. In chapter 32, we explain mutual funds (open-end funds), a type of registered investment vehicle and one type of collective investment vehicle. In the category of mutual funds is one type that invests only in financial instruments that have a maturity of one year or less. These mutual funds are called money market funds and are approaching 3 trillion under management.

Although we have mentioned the role of MMFs as investors many times throughout this chapter, because MMFs are viewed as cash equivalents, they appeal to retail and institutional investors seeking highly liquid short-term investment vehicles. The portfolio managers of MMFs have an investment objective of obtaining the highest potential return consistent with the restrictions on the types of money market instruments in which they may invest and maintain an NAV of \$1 at all times. Historically, it has been the \$1 stable NAV objective that MMFs maintain under Rule 2a-7 that has appealed to investors and resulted in the dramatic growth in MMFs. The concern of investors is that the portfolio might include money market instruments whose market value declines significantly such that the NAV declines below 1 (referred to as "breaking the buck"). A typical warning given to potential investors about the risk associated with investing in an MMF which appears in the prospectus of an MMF is: "An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at 1.00 per share. However, it is possible to realize a loss of capital by investing in the fund. This is because interest rate increases can cause the price of money market securities and hence the fund's value to decrease."

MMFs are regulated by the SEC because of their crucial role in the financial system. For example, earlier we described SEC Rule 2a-7, which restricts the types of CP that can be purchased by MMFs. Because of the problems that occurred with MMFs in the 2008–2009 financial crisis, legislation has been adopted and other legislation proposed for regulating MMFs, as we discuss later in this section.

## Types of MMFs

MMFs are classified according to the types of money market instruments in which the fund manager may invest. The first classification is based on the tax treatment of the money market instruments that may be included in the portfolio. Taxable MMFs invest in the private money market instruments described earlier in this chapter, as well as in Treasury securities and federal agency securities. Tax-free MMFs invest in the money market instruments issued by state and local governments, which are described in chapter 32.

Taxable and tax-free MMFs are classified further, again based on the types of money market instruments in which they are permitted to invest. Taxable MMFs fall into three categories: those that invest only in Treasury securities, those that invest in Treasury and agency securities, and those that invest in Treasury and agency securities and the private money market instruments described in this chapter.

Taxable MMFs that invest in Treasury securities, agency securities, and the private money market instruments described in this chapter are referred to as prime money market funds. With respect to credit risk, prime MMFs carry greater risk than taxable MMFs that invest in Treasury securities only or those that invest in Treasury securities and agency securities. Accordingly, the potential yield is higher for prime MMFs.

Tax-free MMFs are categorized as national municipal MMFs and state municipal MMFs. National municipal MMFs invest in high-quality, short-term municipal money market instruments that are typically exempt from federal income taxes. State municipal MMFs restrict the holdings to instruments of the designated state.

SEC MMF Rules Adopted and Proposed as a Result of the Financial Crisis

Because of the importance of the money market to the financial market and, in turn, the critical role of MMFs as suppliers of capital to the money market, MMFs are highly regulated by the SEC so as to reduce the interest rate risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk faced by investors in this collective investment vehicle. Before the financial crisis that began in 2007, only one MMF had ever broken the buck (i.e., the NAV fell below 1). That track record since the development of the MMF made investors confident about the safety of MMFs as a short-term investment vehicle. Events since the financial crisis, coupled with recent reports on how other MMFs would have broken the buck had it not been for support by the MMF's sponsor, prompted further regulation.

In 2008 one prime MMF, the Reserve Primary Fund, a  \$65 billion fund, became the second MMF to break the buck. The reason for this was the investment of this fund in CP by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. We recall here that reserve funds can invest in CP in addition to Treasury and federal agency financial instruments. Reserve Primary Fund, which had a\$ 785 million position in Lehman's CP when that firm failed on September 15, 2008, did not have sufficient assets to ensure that holders of their shares could redeem them at \$1 per share. The failure of Lehman Brothers resulted in a share price (NAV) of \$0.97, a loss of 3\%. As a result, there were massive redemptions, the equivalent to a run on a bank. To meet the demand for redemptions, the fund's portfolio manager liquidated investments in a money market that was already in a panic mode. The problem faced by the Reserve Primary Fund then spread to other MMFs, resulting in redemptions of about 310 billion from prime MMFs (primarily by institutional investors) during the week of Lehman Brothers' failure.[22]

However, at least two studies have reported that many more MMFs were in danger of breaking the buck were it not for the support of the MMF's sponsors. In a 2012 Staff Report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the authors of the report found that in September and October 2008, the losses for at least 29 MMFs were large enough to cause them to break the buck without the support of the sponsor of the MMF.[23] The average loss would have been $2.2\%$. They found that at least five MMFs experienced losses of $3\%$ of assets. The Prime Reserve Fund, as noted above, lost $3\%$. A 2012 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston that examined 341 prime MMFs from 2007 to 2011 found that at least 21 funds were spared breaking the buck because of sponsorship support.[24] Each of the 21 MMFs received support of about $0.5\%$ of the fund's assets to maintain an NAV of 1.

Because of the important role of MMFs as suppliers of capital to financial and nonfinancial corporations, the money market froze, and corporations that relied on the issuance of CP faced funding problems. The rippling impact of the failure of the Reserve Primary Fund on the MMF industry and the money market itself resulted in government intervention. The announcement of the U.S. Department of the Treasury of its Temporary Treasury Money Market Guarantee Program in September 19, 2008, which would temporarily provide a guarantee for all MMFs, halted the run on MMFs.

As a first step to addressing regulatory concerns identified from the financial crisis, the SEC adopted several rule changes for MMFs. The key reforms that were adopted in February 2010 to better protect investors in MMFs during periods of financial distress were

- rules to enhance risk-limiting constraints on MMF portfolios,
- procedures for facilitating the orderly redemption of MMF shares, and
- the imposition of constraints on repo agreements.

The rules to enhance risk-limiting constraints involved tightening credit standards for MMF portfolio holdings, shortening the weighted average maturity of holdings, and adopting liquidity requirements. The procedure for orderly redemption was a new rule introduced with the goal of mitigating systemic risk caused by breaking the buck. Under the new rule, the portfolio manager of an MMF that is at risk for breaking the buck is permitted to promptly suspend redemptions and liquidate its portfolio in an orderly manner.

Because of the importance of MMFs in repo agreements, the new rules place more stringent constraints on the type of collateral that can be used. As we noted earlier, in a repo agreement, the collateral can be cash or securities (government securities or private debt instruments). The greater constraints involve repurchase agreements where the collateral is a private debt instrument.

To further improve safeguards for investors in MMFs, the Report of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets: Money Market Fund Reform Options (hereafter the PWG report), published on October 21, 2010, identified features of MMFs that made them susceptible to runs and discussed issues related to systemic risk for prime MMFs.[25] Although it endorsed the new rules adopted in February 2010, the PWG report acknowledged that further reforms were needed to prevent the types of market disruptions that had occurred in September 2008. More specifically, the PWG report "undertook a study of possible further reforms that, individually or in combination, might mitigate systemic risk by complementing the SEC's changes to MMF regulation."[26]

The PWG report identified several policy options for further reducing the risks of a run on an MMF, and it sought public comment on these suggestions. The key policy options suggested in the PWG report include the following:

- Allow the NAV to float rather than be maintained at 1 per share. It is the vulnerability to breaking the buck that caused the run on MMFs during the financial crisis.
- Adopt a two-tier system of MMFs: (1) a stable-value NAV MMF and (2) a floating-rate NAV MMF.
- Require that MMFs establish a capital cushion.
- Establish a private emergency liquidity facility.

In July 2014, the SEC adopted its new MMF rules in an 869-page release. The two critical rules are (1) institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt MMFs are required to value their portfolio securities at market value and sell and redeem shares based on a floating NAV, and (2) government MMFs and retail MMFs are permitted to continue to seek to maintain a stable NAV at 1.

## Key Points
- Money market instruments are debt obligations that at issuance have a maturity of one year or less.
- The interbank funding market (interbank lending market) is the market where unsecured and secured loans are made between banks.
- Unsecured lending in the interbank funding market is done in the federal funds market.
- In the secured sector, lending is done by means of repurchase agreements in the repo market.
- In London, unsecured lending in the interbank funding market is used to estimate the cost of borrowing by banks. The rate in this market is the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR).
- Eurocurrency is any currency on deposit in banks outside their country of origin.
- LIBOR is calculated by the British Bankers' Association based on rates reported by a panel of large banks for actual and estimated borrowings.
- The official LIBOR, reported for seven maturities and five currencies, is the most important global interest rate benchmark because of its use as a reference rate for interest rate derivatives and the setting of business and consumer loan rates.
- Manipulation of LIBOR by the panel banks resulted in investigations by regulators and lawsuits filed by parties that claimed financial damages as a consequence of the manipulation.
- In the federal funds market, depository institutions borrow (buy) and sell (lend) excess reserves held in the form of deposits in a Federal Reserve Bank.
- The interest rate for overnight loans of excess reserves as determined in the fed funds market is the funds rate. The Fed establishes a target level for this rate, and so it is not truly a market-determined rate.
- The Federal Reserve Bank pays interest on required reserves and a higher interest rate on excess reserves.
- Disruptions in the interbank funding market during the financial crisis raised the issue of whether this market will be viable in the future.
- A repurchase agreement (or repo agreement) is a lending transaction in which the borrower uses a security as collateral for the borrowing. The transaction is referred to as a "repurchase agreement," because it specifies the sale of a security and its subsequent repurchase at a future date.
- For a repo agreement, the difference between the purchase (repurchase) price and the sale price is the dollar interest cost of the loan.
- An overnight repo is for one day; a loan for more than one day is called a "term repo."
- The collateral in a repo may be a Treasury security, money market instrument, federal agency security, or mortgage-backed security.
- The parties to a repo are exposed to credit risk, limited by margin and the market-to-market practices included in the repo agreement.
- The Fed uses the repo market to implement monetary policy.
- Factors that determine the repo rate are the federal funds rate, the credit quality and liquidity of the collateral, the term of the repo, the delivery requirement, and the availability of the collateral.
- Repo rates can be negative in times of market stress and in normal conditions when rates are near zero.
- Commercial paper (CP) is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued in the open market that represents the obligation of the issuing entity.
Generally, CP has a maturity of less than 90 days.
- Financial and nonfinancial corporations issue CP, with most issued by financial corporations.
- Directly placed CP is sold by the issuing firm directly to investors without using an agent as an intermediary. For dealer-placed CP, the issuer uses the services of an agent to sell its paper.
- Asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) has been used to fund assets using the securitization process. Unlike traditional securitization, the special-purpose vehicle had to roll over the CP issued and was also permitted to obtain additional assets financed by the issuance of additional CP.
- Eurocommercial paper is issued and placed outside the jurisdiction of the currency of denomination; it differs from dollar-denominated paper issued in the United States in several ways.
- Certificates of deposit (CDs) are issued by banks and thrifts to raise funds for financing their business activities. Unlike other bank deposits, CDs are negotiable in the secondary market. CDs can be classified into four types: domestic CDs, Eurodollar CDs (or euro CDs), Yankee CDs, and thrift CDs.
- A banker's acceptance is a vehicle created to facilitate commercial trade transactions, particularly international transactions.
- The term "banker's acceptance" arises because a bank accepts the responsibility to repay a loan to the holder of the vehicle created in a commercial transaction in case the debtor fails to perform.
- Eligible banker's acceptances have an advantage in that they can be used as collateral when borrowing from the Fed at its discount window, and no reserves are required.
- Money market funds (MMFs) are major investors in money market instruments. They are designed to maintain a 1 NAV.
- There are two types of MMFs: taxable and tax-free.
- The three types of taxable MMFs are those that invest in (1) only Treasury securities, (2) Treasury and federal agency securities, and (3) Treasury, federal agency securities, and private money market instruments (these are referred to as "prime MMFs").
- Tax-free MMFs are categorized as national municipal MMFs and state municipal MMFs.
- The concern with MMFs is that the portfolio selection could result in the NAV falling below 1 per share. Such an occurrence is referred to as "breaking the buck."
- Because of the importance of MMFs to the financial markets, additional safeguards have been adopted by the SEC to enhance the credit and liquidity of their portfolios.
- New rules adopted by the SEC to improve the safety of MMFs are based on whether the fund is an institutional prime, an institutional tax-exempt, a government, or a retail MMF.
- Institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt MMFs must be valued at a floating-rate NAV. Government and retail MMFs are still required to maintain a constant NAV of 1.

27. In the SEC release setting forth the new rules adopted in July 2014 requiring a floating NAV for certain types of MMFs, the SEC explained that the intent of the new requirement was not to deter redemptions that constitute "rational risk management by shareholders or that reflect a general incentive to avoid loss." Instead, the SEC said that the purpose of the new rule was to reduce the first-mover advantage inherent in a stable NAV fund by removing the incentive for redemption activity that could result from investors seeking to exploit an opportunity to redeem shares at a stable share price even if the portfolio suffered a loss.

a. What types of MMFs are required to have a floating NAV?

b. Explain what is meant by a "first-mover advantage," and why a floating NAV reduces the likelihood of redemption activity that the SEC indicates is harmful to investors.

In chapter 27, we will discuss the securitization process and the asset-backed securities (ABSs) that corporations can use to obtain debt funding. When CP is issued as part of a securitization that has a short-term maturity, then the CP is referred to as ABCP.[27] As in the case of corporate debt obligations, the distinction between ABSs and ABCP is primarily the tenure of the financial instrument. The former is a mediumto long-term asset, whereas the latter has a short-term maturity.

In our description of ABSs in chapter 27, we explain that a pool of short-term receivables (e.g., credit card receivables) can be purchased by a special-purpose vehicle (SPV), and to fund the purchase of that pool of short-term receivables, the SPV will issue ABSs that are mediumto long-term in maturity. In contrast, securitization can be used by an SPV to finance a pool of longer-term receivables by issuing ABCP. The SPV's objective in a securitization by issuing CP to fund the purchase of the receivables pool is to generate a spread between the yield that can be earned on the pool of receivables and the cost of the funds paid to the holders of the ABCP. Effectively, the SPV is employing a leveraged strategy just as a depository institution does when it borrows funds on a short-term basis and seeks to invest those funds to earn more than its fund cost.

A key distinction between the traditional securitization as described in chapter 27 and the use of securitization to fund a pool of receivables using ABCP has to do with ongoing funding and collateral (i.e., the pool of receivables). In a traditional securitization, once the funding is obtained (i.e., the ABSs are issued), there is no further need to obtain funding. That is, the SPV purchased the pool of receivables using the ABSs issued. In contrast, when ABCP is issued in a securitization, not only is it necessary for the SPV to roll over the ABCP to finance the pool of receivables but the securitization structure also involves adding to the receivables pool. That is, the collateral can increase over time.

Banks have been the major issuers of ABCP, maintaining ongoing ABCP programs. These are runs on the balance sheet of an entity established by the bank called an ABCP conduit, which is a thinly capitalized SPV. It is the conduit that continues to add more receivables and to fund their purchase by issuing ABCP. Although banks have been the major issuers of ABCP, nonbank entities have also issued CP. ABCP conduits have been classified as either single-seller ABCP conduits or multiple-seller ABCP conduits based on the number of originators that provided receivables to the pool.

## Risks Associated with Investing in ABCP

The rollover risk to the holder of an ABCP is the same as that for investors in CP issued by nonfinancial corporations and financial corporations: the inability to find investors who are willing to purchase newly issued ABCP when the current ABCP matures. And it is for the same reason that liquidity support is needed for ABCP, just as it is for CP issued by nonfinancial corporations and financial corporations. ABCP is classified according to the type of liquidity support and can be either fully supported or partly supported by the bank that sponsors the ABCP program.

The disadvantage of a bank fully supporting its ABCP program is that for regulatory purposes, the assets held by the conduit must be included as part of the bank's assets for the determination of capital requirements. This is a disadvantage in that it raises the funding cost of an ABCP program because of reserves that must be held. Banks have developed variants of fully supported conduits that, although receiving bank support, have not been treated as such for regulatory purposes.

Another key risk is that ABCP conduits may have purchased long-term credit risk assets that are illiquid. More specifically, some ABCP conduits purchased residential mortgage loans made to borrowers with an impaired credit history. As explained in chapter 29, mortgage loans to borrowers with this credit characteristic are called "subprime mortgage loans." Mortgage loans themselves are highly illiquid. Consequently, ABCP conduits funding a pool of subprime mortgage loans may face difficulty in liquidating such loans if funds are needed to redeem maturing ABCP and the conduit cannot roll over its paper. This is indeed what happened in the financial crisis, as discussed in the body of this chapter.

Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions) to do so. The implementation of this mandate was accelerated to October 2008 by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
