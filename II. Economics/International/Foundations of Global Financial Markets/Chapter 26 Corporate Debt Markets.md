## Key Points

Corporate debt obligations include six financial instruments: (1) commercial paper, (2) bank loans market, (3) bonds, (4) medium-term notes, (5) asset-backed securities, and (6) equipment leases. Our focus in this chapter is on the bank loans, bonds, and medium-term notes. Commercial paper was covered in chapter 25, and asset-backed securities will be covered in chapter 27. At the end of this chapter, we discuss the bankruptcy or insolvency laws as they relate to corporate creditors.

## Bank Loans

As an alternative to the issuance of securities, a corporation can raise funds by borrowing from a bank. Until recently, in many countries, the dominant form of corporate borrowing was bank loans, because corporate bond markets were not yet well developed.

A corporation may use any of five sourcing alternatives: (1) a domestic bank in the corporation's home country, (2) a subsidiary of a foreign bank established in the corporation's home country, (3) a foreign bank domiciled in a country where the corporation does business, (4) a subsidiary of a domestic bank established in a country where the corporation does business, or (5) an offshore or Eurobank. Loans made by offshore banks are referred to as eurocurrency loans.[2]

The market classifies bank loans to corporate borrowers into two categories: investment-grade loans and leveraged loans. An investment-grade loan is a bank loan made to corporate borrowers that have an investment-grade rating. These loans are typically originated and held by the originating bank in its portfolio, because these loans are revolving lines of credit. In such a loan arrangement, a bank sets a maximum amount that can be borrowed by a corporation, and the corporation can take down any part of that amount and repay it at any time. Because of the ability of the corporate borrower to repay at any time and the absence of a maturity date for the loan, an investment-grade bank loan is not sold by the originating bank to institutional investors.

In contrast, a leveraged loan is a bank loan to a corporation that has a below-investment-grade rating. A leveraged loan has a maturity and the interest rate is floating, the reference rate being the $\text{LIBOR}$. In fact, when market participants refer to corporate bank loans, they typically mean a leveraged loan. These loans can be sold to institutional investors. In the next section, we discuss a corporate bond issued by corporations with a below-investment-grade rating called a "high-yield bond." A corporation may have as its debt obligations both leveraged loans and high-yield bonds. Later in this chapter, we discuss the difference between a leveraged loan and a high-yield bond.

### Syndicated Bank Loans

A syndicated bank loan is one in which a group (or syndicate) of banks provides funds to the borrower. Roughly \$2.5 trillion of financing to U.S. companies is provided by syndicated loans, with the size of a syndicated loan ranging from \$20 million to more than 2 billion. Consequently, the need for a group of banks arises, because the amount sought by a borrower might be too large for any one bank to be exposed to the borrower's credit risk. Therefore, the syndicated bank loan is used by borrowers who seek to raise a large amount of funds in the bank loan market rather than through the issuance of securities.

The syndication may include using the securitization process to create collateralized loan obligations, discussed in chapter 39, and is therefore an important part of the corporate bank loan market. Another important component of this market is loans that provide short-term or backstop financing for corporations that are seeking funds until a more permanent source of financing can be obtained. Such loans are referred to as bridge loans if a loan is provided and bridge loan commitments if the agreement is to provide a future loan. Together, bridge loans and bridge loan commitments are referred to as bridge loan facilities.

Syndicated bank loans are called senior bank loan loans because of their priority position over subordinated lenders (bondholders) with respect to repayment of interest and principal. The interest rate on a syndicated bank loan is a rate that floats, which means that the loan rate is based on some reference rate. The loan rate is periodically reset at the reference rate plus a spread. The reference rate is typically $\text{LIBOR}$, although it could be the prime rate (the rate that a bank charges its most creditworthy customers) or the rate on CDs. The term of the loan is fixed. A syndicated loan is typically structured so that it is amortized according to a predetermined schedule, and repayment of principal begins after a specified number of years (typically not longer than five or six years). Structures in which no repayment of the principal is made until the maturity date can be arranged and are referred to as bullet loans.

A syndicated loan is arranged by either a bank or a securities house. The arranger then lines up the syndicate. Each bank in the syndicate provides the funds for which it has committed. The banks in the syndicate have the right to sell their parts of the loan subsequently to other banks.

Syndicated loans are distributed by two methods: assignment or participation. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, with the method of assignment being the more desirable of the two. The holder of a loan that is interested in selling a portion can do so by passing the interest in the loan by the method of assignment. In this procedure, the seller transfers all rights completely to the holder of the assignment, now called the assignee. The assignee is said to have privity of contract with the borrower. Because of the clear path between the borrower and assignee, assignment is the more desirable choice of transfer and ownership. A participation involves a holder of a loan "participating out" a portion of the holding in that particular loan. The holder of the participation does not become a party to the loan agreement and has a relationship not with the borrower but with the seller of the participation. Unlike an assignment, a participation does not confer privity of contract on the holder of the participation, although the holder of the participation has the right to vote on certain legal matters concerning amendments to the loan agreement. These matters include changes regarding maturity, interest rate, and issues concerning the loan collateral. Because syndicated loans can be sold in this manner, they are marketable.

In response to the large number of bank loans issued and their strong credit protection, some commercial banks and securities houses are more willing to commit capital and resources to facilitate trading as broker-dealers. Also, these senior bank loans can be securitized through the same innovations discussed in chapter 27 for the securitization of loans and discussed further in chapter 39. Further development of the senior bank loan market will no doubt eventually erode the once-important distinction between a security and a loan: A security has long been seen as a marketable financial asset, whereas a loan has not been marketable. Interestingly, the trading of these loans is not limited to performing loans, which are loans whose borrowers are fulfilling contractual commitments. A market also exists for trading nonperforming loans—loans on which the borrowers have defaulted.

#### Secondary Market for Syndicated Bank Loans

Syndicated bank loans can be traded in the secondary market or securitized to create collateralized loan obligations using the securitization technology that is discussed in chapter 27. The trade association that has been the main advocate of commercial loans as an asset class is the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA). The LSTA has helped foster the development of a liquid and transparent secondary market for bank loans by establishing market practices and settlement and operational procedures. The LSTA collects quotations on U.S. loans on a daily basis.

In conjunction with Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary & Data index, the LSTA has also developed a leveraged loan index to gauge the performance of the different sectors of the syndicated loan market. The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan 100 Index is a weekly total return index.

Corporate bonds are classified by the type of issuer. The four general classifications are (1) public utilities, (2) transportation companies, (3) banks/finance companies, and (4) industrial companies. Finer breakdowns are often made to create more homogeneous groupings. For example, public utilities are subdivided into electric power companies, gas distribution companies, water companies, and communications companies. Transportation companies are divided further into airlines, railroads, and trucking companies. Banks/finance companies include money center banks and regional banks, savings and loan institutions, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and finance companies. Industrial companies are the catchall class and the most heterogeneous of the groups with respect to investment characteristics. Industrial companies include manufacturers, mining companies, merchandising companies, retailers, energy companies, and companies in service-related industries.

Classification of the Global Corporate Bond Market

There is no uniform system for classifying the sectors of the global corporate bond market. One possible classification is the one we used in chapter 1 to describe the global financial market. There we said that from the perspective of a given country, the global financial market can be classified into two markets: an internal financial market and an external financial market.

The internal financial market, also called the "national financial market," can be broken into two parts: the domestic financial market and the foreign financial market. The domestic financial market includes the domestic corporate bond market. This market is where issuers domiciled in the country issue bonds and where those bonds are subsequently traded.

The foreign financial market of a country includes the country's foreign corporate bond market. This is the market where bonds of issuers not domiciled in the country are issued and traded. For example, in the United States, the foreign bond market is where bonds are issued by non-U.S. entities and then subsequently traded. Bonds traded in the U.S. foreign bond market are nicknamed "Yankee bonds." In Japan, a yen-denominated bond issued by a British corporation and subsequently traded in Japan's bond market is part of the Japanese foreign bond market. Yen-denominated bonds issued by non-Japanese entities are nicknamed "samurai bonds." Foreign bonds in the United Kingdom are referred to as "bulldog bonds," those in the Netherlands are referred to as "Rembrandt bonds," and those in Spain are called "matador bonds."

Regulatory authorities in the country where the bond is issued impose certain rules governing their issuance. These may include the following:

- restrictions on the bond structures that may be issued (e.g., unsecured debt, zero-coupon bonds, convertible bonds),
- restrictions on the minimum or maximum size of an issue and/or the frequency with which an issuer may come to market,
- a waiting period before an issuer may bring the issue to market (imposed to avoid an oversupply of issues),
- a minimum quality standard (credit rating) for the issue or issuer,
- disclosure and periodic reporting requirements, and
- restrictions on the types of financial institutions permitted to underwrite issues.

In the 1980s, governments generally relaxed or abolished these restrictions to open up bond markets to issuers.

The external corporate bond market, also called the international corporate bond market, is that part of a country's external financial market that includes bonds with the following distinguishing features: they are underwritten by an international syndicate; at issuance, they are offered simultaneously to investors in more than one country; they are issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country; and they are in unregistered form.

### Basic Features of a Corporate Bond Issue

The essential features of a corporate bond issue are relatively simple. The corporate issuer promises to pay a specified percentage of par value (known as the coupon payment) on designated dates and to repay par or principal value of the bond at maturity. In some countries, such as the United States, interest payments are made semiannually; in other countries, the interest payments are made annually. Failure to pay either principal or interest when due constitutes legal default, and court proceedings can be instituted to enforce the contract. Bondholders, as creditors, have a prior legal claim over common and preferred stockholders with regard to both income and assets of the corporation for the principal and interest due them.

The promises of corporate bond issuers and the rights of investors who buy their bonds are set forth in great detail in contracts called bond indentures. The covenants or restrictions on management are important in the analysis of the credit risk of a corporate bond issue. To determine at a particular time whether the corporate issuer is meeting its obligations, a third party to the contract is used: a corporate trustee. A corporate trustee is a bond or trust company with a corporate trust department and officers who are experts in performing the functions of a trustee. The indenture is made out to the corporate trustee as a representative of the interests of bondholders; that is, the trustee acts in a fiduciary capacity for investors who own the bond issue.

A bond's indenture clearly outlines three important aspects: its maturity, its security, and its provisions for retirement.

#### Maturity of bonds
Most corporate bonds are term bonds; that is, they run for a term of years and then become due and payable. Term bonds are often referred to as having bullet maturity, or simply, bullet bonds. Any amount of the liability not paid off prior to maturity must be paid off at that time. The bond's term may be long or short. Generally, obligations due less than 10 years from the date of issue are called notes.

Most corporate borrowings take the form of bonds due in 20 to 30 years. Term bonds may be retired by payment at final maturity or retired prior to maturity if provided for in the indenture. Some corporate bond issues are so arranged that specified principal amounts become due on specified dates prior to maturity. Such issues are called "serial bonds." Equipment trust certificates (discussed later) are structured as serial bonds.

#### Security for bonds
Either real property (using a mortgage) or personal property may be pledged to offer security beyond that of the general credit standing of the issuer. A mortgage bond grants the bondholders a lien against the pledged assets. A lien is a legal right to sell mortgaged property to satisfy unpaid obligations to bondholders. In practice, the foreclosure and sale of mortgaged property are unusual. If a default occurs, usually a financial reorganization of the issuer makes the provision for settlement of the debt to bondholders. However, the mortgage lien is important, because it gives the mortgage bondholders a strong bargaining position relative to other creditors when determining the terms of a reorganization in a bankruptcy. (We discuss reorganization later in this chapter.)

Some companies do not own fixed assets or other real property, and so they have nothing on which they can give a mortgage lien to secure bondholders. Instead, these firms own securities of other companies and thus are holding companies. The firms whose shares are owned are subsidiaries. To satisfy the desire of bondholders for security, the holding companies pledge stocks, notes, bonds, or whatever other kind of financial instruments they own. These assets are termed "collateral" (or "personal property"), and bonds secured by such assets are called "collateral trust bonds."

Many years ago, the railway companies developed a way of financing the purchase of cars and locomotives (i.e., rolling stock) that enabled them to borrow at just about the lowest rates in the corporate bond market. Railway rolling stock was for a long time regarded by investors as excellent security for debt. The equipment is sufficiently standardized that it can be used by one railway as well as another. And, of course, it can be readily moved from the tracks of one railroad to those of another. Therefore, generally a good market exists for the lease or sale of cars and locomotives. The railroads take advantage of these characteristics of rolling stock by developing a legal arrangement for giving investors a legal claim on it that is different from, and generally superior to, a mortgage lien.

In this situation, the legal arrangement vests legal title to railway equipment in a trustee. When a railway company orders some cars and locomotives from a manufacturer, the manufacturer transfers legal title to the equipment to that trustee. The trustee in turn leases the equipment to the railroad, and at the same time sells equipment trust certificates to obtain the funds to pay the manufacturer. The trustee collects lease payments from the railroad and uses these receipts to pay interest and principal on the certificates. The principal is therefore paid off on specified dates, a provision that distinguishes a certificate from a term bond.

The general idea of the equipment trust arrangement is also used by companies engaged in providing other kinds of transportation. For example, trucking companies finance the purchase of huge fleets of trucks in the same manner; airlines use this kind of financing to purchase planes; and international oil companies use it to buy huge tankers.

A debenture bond is not secured by a specific pledge of property, which does not mean that this type of bond has no claim on the property of issuers or on their earnings. Debenture bondholders hold the claim of general creditors on all assets of the issuer not pledged specifically to secure other debt. Also, holders of debentures can claim pledged assets to the extent that these assets have value greater than that necessary to satisfy secured creditors. A subordinated debenture bond is an issue that ranks after secured debt, after debenture bonds, and often after some general creditors in its claim on assets and earnings.

The type of corporate security issued determines the cost to the issuer. For a given corporation, mortgage bonds will cost less than debenture bonds, and debenture bonds will cost less than subordinated debenture bonds. A guaranteed bond is an obligation guaranteed by another entity. The safety of a guaranteed bond depends on the financial capability of the guarantor to satisfy the terms of the guarantee, as well as on the financial capability of the issuer. The terms of the guarantee may call for the guarantor to guarantee the payment of interest and/or repayment of the principal.

Note that a superior legal status will not prevent bondholders from suffering financial loss when the issuer's ability to generate cash flow adequate to pay its obligations is seriously eroded.

#### Provisions for paying off bonds
Most corporate issues contain a call provision allowing the issuer the option to buy back all or part of the issue prior to maturity. Some issues carry a sinking fund provision, which specifies that the issuer must retire a predetermined amount of the issue periodically.

When negotiating the terms of a new bond issue, an important question is whether the issuer has the right to redeem the entire amount of bonds outstanding on a date before maturity. Issuers generally want this right, because they recognize that at some time in the future, the general level of interest rates may fall sufficiently below the issue's coupon rate that redeeming the issue and replacing it with another issue carrying a lower coupon rate would be attractive. For reasons discussed later in this chapter, this right represents a disadvantage to the bondholder.

The usual practice is a provision that denies the issuer the right to redeem bonds during the first 5 to 10 years following the date of issue with proceeds received from the sale of lower-cost debt obligations that have an equal or superior rank to the debt to be redeemed. This type of redemption is called refunding. Even though most long-term issues carry these refunding restrictions, they may be immediately callable, in whole or in part, if the source of funds is something other than money raised with debt that carries a lower interest cost. Under such a provision, acceptable sources include cash flow from operations, proceeds from a common stock sale, or funds from the sale of property.

Investors often confuse refunding protection with call protection. Call protection is much more comprehensive, because it prohibits the early redemption of the bond for any reason. In contrast, refunding restrictions provide protection only against the one type of redemption already mentioned. As a rule, corporate bonds are callable at a premium above par. Generally, the amount of the premium declines as the bond approaches maturity and often reaches zero after some number of years following issuance. The initial amount of the premium may be as much as one year's coupon interest or as little as the coupon interest for half of a year.

If the issuer has the choice to retire all or part of an issue prior to maturity, the buyer of the bond takes the chance that the issue will be called away at a disadvantageous time. This risk is referred to as call risk or timing risk. Call provisions present two disadvantages from the investor's perspective. First, as explained in chapter 11, a decline in interest rates in the economy increases the price of a debt instrument, although in the case of a callable bond, the price increase is somewhat limited. If and when interest rates decline far enough below the coupon rate to make a call an immediate or prospective danger, the market value of the callable bond will not rise as much as that of noncallable issues that are similar in all other respects. Second, when a bond issue is called as a result of a decline in interest rates, the investor must reinvest the proceeds received at a lower interest rate (unless the investor chooses debt of greater risk).

Corporate bond indentures may require the issuer to retire a specified portion of an issue each year. This sinking fund provision for the repayment of the debt may be designed to liquidate all of a bond issue by the maturity date, or it may call for the liquidation of only a part of the total by the end of the term. If only a part of the outstanding bond is paid before retirement, the remainder is called a balloon maturity. The purpose of the sinking fund provision is to reduce credit risk. Generally, the issuer may satisfy the sinking fund requirement by either (1) making a cash payment of the face amount of the bonds to be retired to the corporate trustee, which then calls the bonds for redemption using a lottery, or (2) delivering to the trustee bonds with a total face value equal to the amount that must be retired from bonds purchased in the open market.

## Bond Features

Here we look at the different type of bond features that have been used by corporations throughout the world. We discuss unique structures for issuers of high-yield corporate bonds later.

### Convertible and exchangeable bonds
The conversion provision in a corporate bond issue grants the bondholder the right to convert the bond to a predetermined number of shares of common stock of the issuer. A convertible bond is therefore a corporate bond with a call option to buy the common stock of the issuer. An exchangeable bond grants the bondholder the right to exchange the bond for the common stock of a firm other than the issuer of the bond. For example, Ford Motor Credit exchangeable bonds are exchangeable for the common stock of its parent company, Ford Motor Company.

### Issues of debt with warrants
Warrants may be attached as a part of a bond issue. A warrant grants the holder the right to purchase a designated security at a specified price from the issuer of the bond. A warrant is simply a call option. It may permit the holder to purchase the common stock of the issuer of the debt or the common stock of a firm other than the issuer's. Or the warrant may grant the holder the right to purchase a debt obligation of the issuer. Generally, warrants can be detached from the bond and sold separately. Typically, when exercising the warrant, an investor may choose either to pay cash or to offer the debt (valued at par) that was part of the offering. A major difference between warrants and convertible or exchangeable bonds is that an investor exercising the option provided by the latter must turn the bond in to the issuer.

### Putable bonds
A putable bond grants the bondholder the right to sell the issue back to the issuer at par value on designated dates. The advantage to the bondholder is that if interest rates rise after the issue date, thereby reducing the market value of the bond, the bondholder can sell the bond back to the issuer for par.

### Zero-coupon bonds
Zero-coupon bonds are, just as the name implies, bonds without coupon payments or a stated interest rate. In the Treasury market, the U.S. government does not issue zero-coupon bonds. Dealers strip issues and create these bonds from the cash flow of a coupon Treasury bond. Corporations, however, can and do issue zero-coupon bonds. The first such public offering was in the spring of 1981. From the investor's perspective, the attractiveness of a zero-coupon bond is that the investor who holds the bond to the maturity date will realize a predetermined return on the bond, unlike a coupon bond, where the actual return realized, if the bond is held to maturity, depends on the rate at which coupon payments can be reinvested.

### Floating-rate securities
The coupon interest on floating-rate securities is reset periodically to follow changes in the level of some predetermined benchmark rate. For example, the coupon rate may be reset every six months to a rate equal to a spread of 100 basis points over the six-month Treasury bill rate.

Floating-rate securities are attractive to some institutional investors, because they allow the purchase of an asset with an income stream that closely matches the floating nature of the income of specific liabilities. Certain floating-rate instruments are viewed by some investors as a passive substitute for short-term investments, particularly that part of a short-term portfolio that is more or less consistently maintained at certain minimum levels. Thus, floating-rate securities save on the costs of constantly rolling over short-term securities as they reach maturity.

Why do corporations issue floating-rate securities? Closer matching of their income flows from variable-rate assets with floating-rate liabilities is of major importance, especially with such lenders as banks, thrifts, and finance companies. Issuers can fix or lock in a spread between the cost of borrowed funds and the rate at which those funds are loaned out. Another reason might be to avoid uncertainties associated with what could be an unreceptive market at some future date. The issuer can tap a new source for intermediateto long-term funds at short-term rates, thereby making fewer trips to the marketplace and avoiding related issuance costs.

Also, in the presence of inflation, a floating-rate security (rolled over, if needed) may have a lower interest cost than a fixed-rate, long-term security. The reason is that, with inflation, the long rate may incorporate a substantial premium against the uncertainty of future inflation and interest rates. Finally, as noted in our discussion of interest rate swaps in chapter 37, an issuer may find that it can issue a floating-rate security and convert payments into a fixed-rate stream through an interest rate swap agreement. An issuer will elect this approach if the cost of issuing a floating-rate security and then using an interest rate swap results in a lower cost than simply issuing a fixed-rate security.

Other features may be included in a floating-rate issue. For example, many floating-rate issues include a put option. Some issues are exchangeable either automatically at a certain date (often five years after issuance) or at the option of the issuer into fixed-rate securities. A few issues are convertible into the common stock of the issuer. Many floating-rate issues have a ceiling or maximum interest rate for the coupon rate; some have a floor or minimum interest rate for the coupon rate.

### Inflation-indexed bonds
Corporate inflation-indexed bonds have interest or principal linked to a nationally recognized inflation measure, such as the U.S. consumer price index (U.S. CPI) in the United States, the Eurozone's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (excluding tobacco), the U.K.'s Retail Price Index, and France's CPI (excluding tobacco). As explained in chapter 20, these issues are referred to as "Treasury inflation protected securities," or TIPS. Outside the United States, bond coupon rates are linked to the rate of inflation and are referred to as linkers.

### Dual-currency bonds
Some issues pay coupon interest in one currency and the principal in a different currency. Such issues are called dual-currency issues. For the first type of dual-currency bond, the exchange rate that is used to convert the principal and coupon payments into a specific currency is specified at the time the bond is issued. The second type differs from the first in that the applicable exchange rate is the rate that prevails at the time a cash flow is made (i.e., at the spot exchange rate at the time a payment is made). A third type offers to either the investor or the issuer the choice of currency. These bonds are commonly referred to as option currency bonds.

## Adjusting Yields for Different Interest Payment Frequencies

For a bond that pays coupon interest, the frequency with which the issuer makes interest payments varies by country. Although yield measures, such as the yield to maturity, are not very useful for assessing the potential return from investing in a bond, market convention is used for calculating yield.

Let's begin with the traditional convention for calculating yield to maturity. In that convention, the benchmark is computing the yield on a bond that pays interest semiannually. The yield to maturity measure is calculated by first determining the interest rate that makes the present value of the semiannual cash flow equal to the price, and then doubles that interest rate. As explained in chapter 16, the yield to maturity calculated in this manner is called the bond-equivalent yield (BEY).

The frequency of corporate bond interest payments can be semiannual or annual payments. Different countries follow a practice of issuing one or the other. In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia, for example, the frequency of payment of corporate bonds is semiannually. In the Eurobond market and many European countries, the practice is to make coupon interest payments annually. To compare an annual-pay bond to a semiannual-pay bond on BEY basis, the following formula is used:

BEY of an annual-pay bond  $= 2[(1 +$  Yield to maturity on an annual pay bond) $^{1/2} - 1]$ .

This formula computes the semiannual yield for the annual-pay bond and then doubles it. Recall the convention used in calculating the BEY for a semiannual-paying bond. For example, suppose that the yield to maturity of an annual-pay bond is  $6\%$ . Then its BEY is

$$
2 \left[ (1 + 0.06)^{1 / 2} - 1 \right] = 0.0591 = 5.91 \%
$$

Notice that the BEY will always be less than the annual-pay bond's yield to maturity.

To convert the BEY of a semiannual-pay basis so that it can be compared to the yield to maturity of an annual-pay bond, the following formula can be used:

Yield to maturity on annual-pay basis  $= [1 + (\text{Yieldtomaturityona BEYbasis}/2)]^2 - 1$ .

For example, suppose that the yield to maturity of a semiannual-pay bond is quoted on a BEY basis is  $5.5\%$ . The yield to maturity on an annual-pay basis would then be

$$
[(1 + 0.055 / 2)^{2} ] - 1 = 0.0558 = 5.58 \%
$$

The yield to maturity on an annual-pay basis is always greater than the yield to maturity on a BEY basis.

As already noted, high-yield bonds are issues with a credit rating below triple B. Bond issues in this sector of the market may have been rated investment grade at the time of issuance and have been downgraded subsequently to noninvestment grade, or they may have been rated noninvestment grade at the time of issuance, called original-issue, high-yield bonds.

Downgraded bonds fall into two groups: (1) issues downgraded because the issuer voluntarily significantly increased its debt as a result of a leveraged buyout or a recapitalization, and (2) issues downgraded for other reasons. The latter issues are commonly referred to as fallen angels.

Role of high-yield bonds in financial markets The introduction of original-issue, high-yield bonds proved to be an important financial innovation with wide impact throughout the financial system. A common view held that high-default-risk bonds would not be attractive to the investing public, at least at interest rates that would be acceptable to the borrower. The view rested on the skewed nature of the outcomes offered by the instrument: The maximum return that an investor can obtain is capped by the coupon and face value, but the loss could be as large as the principal invested. It was the merit of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and particularly of Michael Milken of that firm, to disprove that view, as evidenced by the explosive growth of this market.

Before the development of the high-yield market, U.S. corporations that could not issue securities in the public debt market would borrow from commercial banks or finance companies on a shortto intermediate-term basis or would be shut off from credit. With the advent of the high-yield bond structure, financing shifted from commercial banks to the public market.

In essence, the high-yield bond market shifts the risk from commercial banks to the investing public in general. Several advantages occur with such a shift. First, when commercial banks lend to high-credit-risk borrowers, that risk is accepted indirectly by all U.S. citizens, who may not wish to accept the risk. The reason is that the commercial bank liabilities are backed by the FDIC and so carry the guarantee of the U.S. government. If high-credit-risk corporations default on their loans, causing an FDIC bailout, all taxpayers eventually may have to pay. The liabilities of other investors (excluding thrifts that have invested in high-yield bonds) are not backed by the U.S. government (and, therefore, not by U.S. citizens). The risks of this investing are taken by the specific investor group willing to accept them.

The second advantage is that commercial bank loans are typically short-term, floating-rate loans, which make debt financing less attractive to corporations. High-yield bond issues give corporations the opportunity to issue long-term, fixed-rate debt. Third, commercial banks set interest rates based on their credit analysis. When high-yield bonds are traded in a public market, the investing public establishes the interest rate. Finally, the high-yield market opens up the possibility of funding for some firms that previously had no means to obtain it.

Corporate bond issuers use the proceeds from a bond sale for various purposes, including working capital, expansion of facilities, refinancing of outstanding debt, and financing takeovers (mergers and acquisitions). In the case of noninvestment-grade bonds, it is the use of the proceeds to finance takeovers (particularly hostile takeovers) that aroused public concern over the excessive use of debt by U.S. corporations.[5]

High-yield bond structures In the early years of the high-yield market, all issues followed a conventional structure: The issues paid a fixed coupon rate and were term bonds. Today, however, more complex bond structures occupy the junk bond space, particularly for bonds issued for leveraged buyout (LBO) financing and recapitalizations producing higher debt.

In an LBO or a recapitalization, the heavy interest payment burden that the corporation assumes places severe cash flow constraints on the firm. To reduce this burden, firms involved in LBOs and recapitalizations issue bonds with deferred coupon structures that permit the issuer to avoid using cash to make interest payments for a period of three to seven years. Deferred coupon structures include (1) deferred-interest bonds, (2) step-up bonds, and (3) payment-in-kind bonds.

Deferred-interest bonds are the most common type of deferred coupon structure. These bonds sell at a deep discount and do not pay interest for an initial period, typically for three to seven years. (Because no interest is paid for an initial period, these bonds are sometimes referred to as "zero-coupon" bonds.) Step-up bonds do pay coupon interest, but the coupon rate is low for an initial period and then increases ("steps up") to a higher coupon rate. Finally, payment-in-kind bonds give the issuer an option to pay cash at a coupon payment date or give the bondholder a similar bond (i.e., a bond with the same coupon rate and a par value equal to the amount of the coupon payment that would have been paid). The period during which the issuer can make this choice varies from 5 to 10 years.

As explained earlier in this chapter, leveraged loans are bank loans in which the borrower is a noninvestment-grade borrower. Hence, leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are alternative sources of debt for noninvestment-grade borrowers. Here we summarize the distinguishing characteristics of these sources of debt funding.

The coupon rate on high-yield bonds is typically a fixed interest rate. For leveraged loans, it is a floating rate, with the most common reference rate being the three-month $\text{LIBOR}$. High-yield bonds usually have a maturity of 10 years and are noncallable until three or five years after issuance. Leveraged loans are shorter term, usually five to eight years, and offer no call protection: They are callable at any time.

In the capital structure, leveraged loans are the most senior bonds, and high-yield bonds are subordinated to bank loans. With respect to covenants, they are stronger for leveraged loans than for high-yield bonds, which is one of the reasons corporate borrowers prefer to issue bonds. Finally, as we explain below, investors are concerned with the amount that can be recovered in the case of a default. Historically, the average recovery rate for defaulted leveraged loans is much higher than that for defaulted high-yield bonds.

Corporate bond defaults and recovery rates A good deal of published research has investigated corporate bond default rates. Various methodologies are used by CRAs and researchers to measure corporate bond default rates. As expected, all studies indicate that historically, there was a higher percentage of defaults as the credit rating declines. For example, Moody's reports that for 1982 to 2010, virtually no defaults occurred for corporate bonds rated in its top three rating categories (Aaa, Aa1, and Aa2). In contrast, for Moody's Ca-rated corporate bonds, the default rate was about  $33\%$ . Looking at default rates for investment-grade and speculative-grade bonds, the average Moody's default rate for the former was less than  $1\%$ , whereas for the latter it was  $4.8\%$ .

To evaluate the performance of the corporate bond sector, more than just default rates are needed. The reason is that default rates by themselves are not of paramount significance: It is perfectly possible for a portfolio of corporate bonds to suffer defaults and to outperform Treasuries at the same time, provided the yield spread of the portfolio is sufficiently high to offset the losses from defaults. Furthermore, because holders of defaulted bonds typically recover a percentage of the face amount of their investment, this is called the recovery rate. Therefore, an important measure for studying the performance of the corporate bond sector is the default loss rate, which is defined as follows:

Default loss rate  $=$  Default rate  $\times$  (100\% - Recovery rate).

For instance, a default rate of  $5\%$  and a recovery rate of  $30\%$  means a default loss rate of  $3.5\%$  ( $5\% \times 70\%$ ). Therefore, focusing exclusively on default rates merely highlights the worst possible outcome that a diversified portfolio of corporate bonds would suffer, assuming all defaulted bonds would be totally worthless.

As with default rates, different methodologies have been used to compute recovery rates. The annual average recovery rate on defaulted bank loans from 1982 to 2010 as reported by Moody's was  $65.8\%$  for first-lien bank loans,  $29.1\%$  for second-lien bank loans, and  $47.8\%$  for third-lien bank loans. For bonds, the average annual recovery rate by the bond's lien position ranged from  $50.8\%$  for senior secured bonds to  $24.7\%$  for junior subordinated bonds.[8]

The Eurobond market is divided into sectors depending on the currency in which the issue is denominated. For example, when Eurobonds are denominated in U.S. dollars, they are referred to as Eurodollar bonds. Eurobonds denominated in Japanese yen are referred to as Euroyen bonds.

It has become increasingly difficult to classify a bond issue as a foreign bond or a Eurobond based on the distinguishing characteristics cited earlier. It is common to refer to a corporate bond as a "Eurobond offering" if it has only one underwriter and its issue is placed primarily outside the national market of both the issuer and the underwriter. Another characteristic of a Eurobond is that it is not regulated by the single country whose currency is used to pay bondholders. In practice, however, only the United States and Canada do not place restrictions on U.S. dollar-denominated or Canadian dollar-denominated issues sold outside the two countries. Regulators of other countries whose currencies are used in Eurobond issues have closely supervised such offerings. Their power to regulate Eurobond offerings comes from their ability to impose foreign exchange or capital restrictions.

Although Eurobonds are typically registered on a national stock exchange (the most common being the Luxembourg, London, or Zurich exchanges), the bulk of all trading is in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Listing is purely to circumvent restrictions imposed on some institutional investors who are prohibited from purchasing securities that are not listed on an exchange. Some of the stronger issuers privately place issues with international institutional investors.

## Asian Corporate Bond Market

The principal market for raising capital in the debt market in Asian countries has been via traditional bank borrowing. Following the global financial crisis, however, corporations have made greater use of the bond market to diversify their funding sources. Measured in terms of the amount of corporate bonds outstanding relative to the size (in terms of GDP) of a country's economy, five countries have outstanding bonds exceeding  $50\%$  of GDP and are viewed as having advanced bond markets: Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan.[9] China, India, Indonesia, and Thailand are countries in the early stages of development of their corporate bond market, but there are signs that these markets will grow rapidly. For example, China doubled the share of corporate bonds outstanding relative to GDP in 2009-2013, making it the largest regional corporate bond market in terms of U.S. dollars.

The Asian corporate bond market is divided into two sectors, based on whether the currency of denomination of the issue is a foreign currency or the local currency. Corporate bonds denominated in a foreign currency are referred to as the regional corporate bonds, whereas corporate bonds denominated in the country's own currency are referred to as local currency bonds. The foreign currency for most regional corporate bonds is the U.S. dollar. The corporate issuers in this market are global and top-tier local corporate entities. Approximately  $83\%$  of Asian non-financial corporate bonds markets are denominated in their local currencies.[10]

## The Secondary Corporate Bond Market and Its Regulation

As with all bonds, the principal secondary market for corporate bonds is the OTC market. The major concern is market transparency.

In the United States, the reporting system and compliance vehicle of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), requires that all broker-dealers who are members of FINRA must, under a set of rules approved by the SEC, report transactions in corporate bonds (investment grade, high yield, and convertible bonds) to TRACE. At the end of each trading day, market aggregate statistics are published on corporate bond market activity. The end-of-day recap information provided includes (1) the number of securities and total par amount traded; (2) advances, declines, and 52-week highs and lows; and (3) the 10 most active investment-grade, high-yield, and convertible bonds for the day.

The European Union has passed various legal acts dealing with financial markets. The legal acts are in the form of what the European Union refers to as "regulations" and "directives."[11] There are EU regulations and directives on various aspects of the financial markets. These legal acts deal with wideranging issues and attempt to create a single European financial market that provides greater protection for investors, improved conduct by market participants, stability for the financial system, and market transparency. The key regulations for providing transparency in the secondary bond market (including securitized products) are part of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), Level 1 adopted in April 2014 by the EU Parliament. The rules are now applied to bonds and derivatives, whereas the MiFID, referred to as MiFID I, set rules only for equities.

MiFID II introduces a market structure framework that ensures that trading, wherever appropriate, takes place on regulated platforms. The regulation calls for the reporting of post-trade information in as close to real time as possible. Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation allows waivers to the reporting requirements based on certain factors, with the specific rules regarding waivers (as well as delayed reporting) left to the European Securities and Markets Authority to formulate. Improved transparency was established by rules to enhance the effective consolidation and disclosure of trading data. These rules oblige trading venues to make available to market participants preand post-trade data at a reasonable cost and to do so by establishing a consolidated tape mechanism for post-trade data.

### Electronic bond trading
Traditionally, corporate bond trading has been an OTC market conducted by telephone and based on broker-dealer trading desks that take principal positions in corporate bonds to fulfill the buy and sell orders of their customers. There has been a transition away from this traditional form of bond trading and toward electronic trading.

Electronic bond trading makes up about  $30\%$  of corporate bond trading. The major advantages of electronic trading over traditional corporate bond trading in the OTC market are (1) the ability to provide liquidity to the markets, (2) enhanced price discovery (particularly for less liquid markets), (3) the use of new technologies, and (4) trading and portfolio management efficiencies. As an example of the advantage, a portfolio manager can load buy and sell orders on a website, trade from these orders, and then clear the orders.

There are five types of electronic corporate bond trading systems. Auction systems allow participants with a low market share to conduct electronic auctions of securities offerings for both new issues in the primary market and secondary market offerings. Auction systems are not typically used. Cross-matching systems bring dealers and institutional investors together in electronic trading networks that provide real-time or periodic cross-matching sessions. Buy and sell orders are executed automatically when matched. Interdealer systems allow dealers to execute transactions electronically with other dealers through the anonymous services of "brokers' brokers." The clients of dealers are not involved in interdealer systems. Multidealer systems allow customers with consolidated orders from two or more dealers to execute from among multiple quotes. Multidealer systems, also called client-to-dealer systems, typically display to customers the best bid or offer price of those posted by all dealers. The participating dealer usually acts as the principal in the transaction. Single-dealer systems permit investors to execute transactions directly with the specific dealer desired; this dealer acts as a principal in the transaction, with investor access to the dealer, which increasingly has been through the Internet. Thus, single-dealer systems simply replace telephone contact between a single dealer and a customer with Internet contact.

## Medium-Term Notes

A medium-term note (MTN) is a corporate debt instrument with the unique characteristic that such notes are offered continuously to investors by an agent of the issuer. Investors can select from several maturity ranges: nine months to one year, more than one year to 18 months, more than 18 months to two years, and so on, up to 30 years. MTNs are registered with the SEC under Rule 415 (the shelf registration rule), which gives a corporation maximum flexibility for issuing securities on a continuous basis.

The term "medium-term note" to describe this corporate debt instrument is misleading. Traditionally, the term "note" or "medium term" was used to refer to debt issues with a maturity greater than one year but less than 15 years. Certainly, this characteristic is stretched for MTNs, because they have been sold with maturities from nine months to 30 years, and even longer. For example, in July 1993, Walt Disney Corporation issued a security with a 100-year maturity off its medium-term note shelf registration.

In 1982, Rule 415 was adopted, making it easier for issuers to sell registered securities on a continuous basis.

Borrowers have flexibility when designing MTNs to satisfy their own needs. They can issue fixed or floating-rate debt. The coupon payments can be denominated in U.S. dollars or in a foreign currency.

When the treasurer of a corporation contemplates an offering of either MTNs or corporate bonds, two factors affect the decision. The most obvious is the cost of the funds raised after consideration of registration and distribution costs. This cost is referred to as the all-in-cost of funds. The second is the flexibility afforded to the issuer in structuring the offering. The growth in the MTN market is evidence of the relative advantage of MTNs with respect to cost and flexibility for some offerings. However, some corporations raise funds by issuing both bonds and MTNs, which would indicate that no absolute advantage can be gained in all instances and market environments.

MTNs are rated by credit rating agencies. About  $99\%$  of all MTNs issued receive an investment-grade rating at the time of issuance.

### The Primary Market

MTNs differ from corporate bonds in the way that they are distributed to investors when initially sold. Although some investment-grade corporate bond issues are sold on a best-efforts basis, typically they are underwritten by investment bankers. The traditional method of distribution for MTNs is on a best-efforts basis by either an investment banking firm or other broker-dealers acting as agents. Another difference between corporate bonds and MTNs when they are offered is that MTNs are usually sold in relatively small amounts on a continuous or an intermittent basis, whereas corporate bonds are sold in large, discrete offerings.

In the United States, a corporation that wants an MTN program will file a shelf registration with the SEC for the offering of securities. The SEC registration for MTN offerings is between \$100 and \$1 billion, but once the total is sold, the issuer can file another shelf registration. The registration includes a list of the investment banking firms, usually two to four, that the corporation has engaged to act as agents to distribute the MTNs. The large New York-based investment banking firms dominate the distribution market for MTNs.

The issuer then posts rates over a range of maturities: for example, nine months to one year, one year to 18 months, 18 months to two years, and annually thereafter. Usually, an issuer will post rates as a spread over a Treasury security of comparable maturity. The rate offering schedule can be changed at any time by the issuer either in response to changing market conditions or because the issuer has raised the desired amount of funds at a given maturity. In the latter case, the issuer can either not post a rate for that maturity range or lower the rate. The agents then make the offering rate schedule available to their investor base interested in MTNs. An investor interested in the offering contacts the agent. In turn, the agent contacts the issuer to confirm the terms of the transaction. Because the maturity range in the offering rate schedule does not specify a specific maturity date, the investor can choose the final maturity subject to approval by the issuer. The minimum size an investor can purchase of an MTN offering typically ranges from \$1 million to \$25 million.

### Structured MTNs

It is common today for issuers of MTNs to couple their offerings with transactions in the derivative markets (options, futures/forward contracts, swaps, caps, and floors) so as to create debt obligations with more interesting risk/return features than are available in the corporate bond market. Specifically, an issue may have a floating rate over all or part of the life of the security, and the coupon reset formula may be based on a benchmark interest rate, equity index or individual stock price, a foreign exchange rate, or a commodity index.

Some MTNs even offer coupon reset formulas that vary inversely with a benchmark interest rate; that is, if the benchmark interest rate increases (decreases), the coupon rate decreases (increases). Debt instruments with this coupon characteristic are called inverse floating-rate securities.

MTNs created when the issuer simultaneously transacts in the derivative markets are called structured notes. The most common derivative instrument used when creating structured notes is a swap—a derivative instrument that we discussed in chapter 37. The motivation for issuing a structured note is that investors are willing to pay a premium for such securities and, as a result, the issuer will realize a lower funding cost than by just issuing a standard MTN or corporate bond.

## Lease Financing

The market for lease financing is a segment of the larger market for equipment financing. Any type of equipment that can be purchased with borrowed funds can also be leased. Our interest here is in the leasing of equipment that can be classified as a big-ticket item (i.e., equipment costing more than 5 million). Included in this group are commercial aircraft, large ships, large quantities of production equipment, and energy facilities. A special type of leasing arrangement, known as a leveraged lease, is used when financing such equipment.

Leasing works as follows. The potential equipment user, called the lessee, first selects the equipment and the dealer or manufacturer from which the equipment will be purchased. The lessee negotiates such aspects of the transaction as the purchase price, specifications, warranties, and delivery date. When the lessee accepts the terms of the deal, another party, such as a bank or finance company, buys the equipment from the dealer or manufacturer and leases it to the lessee. This party is called the lessor. The lease is so arranged that the lessor realizes the tax benefits associated with the ownership of the leased equipment.

Basically, leasing is a vehicle by which tax benefits can be transferred from the user of the equipment (the lessee), which may not have the capacity to take advantage of the tax benefits associated with equipment ownership (e.g., depreciation and any tax credits), to another entity that can utilize them (the lessor). In exchange for these tax benefits, a lessor provides lower-cost financing to the lessee than the lessee could get by purchasing the equipment with borrowed funds. Such leases are referred to as tax-oriented leases.

The two ways in which a lessor can finance the purchase of the equipment are, first, to provide all the financing from its own funds and therefore be at risk for  $100\%$  of the funds used to purchase the equipment. Such leasing arrangements are referred to as single-investor or direct leases. Essentially, such leases are two-party agreements (between the lessee and the lessor). The second way is for the lessor to use only a portion of its own funds to purchase the equipment and to borrow the balance from a bank or group of banks. This type of leasing arrangement is called a leveraged lease. The three parties to a leveraged lease agreement are the lessee, the lessor, and the lender. The leveraged lease arrangement allows the lessor to realize all the tax benefits from owning the equipment and the tax benefits from borrowing funds—deductible interest payments—while putting up only a portion of its own funds to purchase the equipment. Therefore, leveraged leasing is commonly used in financing big-ticket items.

In a leveraged lease transaction, it is necessary for a party to arrange for the equity and the debt portions of the funding involved. The same party can arrange both. The equity portion is typically provided by one or more institutional investors. The debt portion is arranged with a bank. Because leveraged lease transactions are for large-ticket items, the bank debt is typically arranged as a syndicated bank loan. For example, the financing of aircraft is normally accomplished through leveraged lease financing.

## Insolvency Laws

Every country has its own insolvency laws or bankruptcy laws for dealing with corporations having financial difficulties paying off their creditors and the treatment of corporate creditors. We first review the general issues covered by the bankruptcy laws in all countries. However, we cannot provide a description of every country's insolvency laws. Because many countries base their bankruptcy procedures on the U.S. bankruptcy system, we will review this system.

### Issues Covered by Insolvency Laws

Insolvency or bankruptcy laws deal with the following issues:

- who can file for bankruptcy;
- the weight that the courts dealing with bankruptcy will give to creditors, equity investors, and other stakeholders;
- whether the company's management will be permitted to continue to manage the enterprise;
- the type of bankruptcy arrangement permitted (liquidation or reorganization); and
- whether there will be an automatic injunction that prevents creditors from recovering their debt when a company files for bankruptcy (referred to as an "automatic stay").

Preconditions must be satisfied for business enterprises to use the country's insolvency laws. If these conditions are satisfied, a business enterprise itself can apply for bankruptcy, referred to a voluntary bankruptcy, or its creditors can force it into bankruptcy, referred to an involuntary bankruptcy. After analyzing the conditions for bankruptcy for about 42 countries, one study finds that "as a whole, most countries make the inability to pay off debts the basic condition for bankruptcy."12

There is a priority of payments to creditors. Most countries follow priority rules for creditors whereby senior creditors paid in full before junior creditors are paid anything. Most countries give priority to secured creditors over employee creditors (i.e., amount due to employees for their compensation owed). This occurs depending on the development of a country's financial market. Countries that give priority to secured creditors over employee creditors do so because in the early stage of economic development, raising capital in the financial market is viewed as being more important than the need for labor.[13]

A common objective of the bankruptcy laws in most countries is the ability to allow the business entity to work out with creditors a financial plan to enable it to satisfy some creditor obligations and remain in business as a new business entity. This is referred to a reorganization of the business entity. Bankruptcy rules deal with how reorganization is to take place. Some holders of claims against the bankrupt business entity receive cash in exchange for their claims, others may receive new securities in the new business entity that results from the reorganization, and others may receive a combination of both cash and new securities in the resulting business entity. In contrast to a reorganization is the liquidation of a business entity. In a liquidation, all the assets of the bankrupt business entity will be distributed to the holders of claims, and no business entity will come into existence.

### The U.S. Bankruptcy System

The law governing bankruptcy in the United States is the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 and its amendments. This act sets forth the rules for a corporation to be either liquidated or reorganized. Another purpose of the bankruptcy act is to give a corporation time to decide whether to reorganize or liquidate, and then the necessary time to formulate a plan to accomplish either decision. The time is allowed because when a corporation files for bankruptcy, the act grants the corporation protection from creditors who seek to collect their claims. The petition for bankruptcy can be filed either by the company itself (i.e., a voluntary bankruptcy) or by its creditors (an involuntary bankruptcy). A company that files for protection under the bankruptcy act generally becomes a "debtor in possession" and continues to operate its business under the supervision of the court.

The bankruptcy act consists of 15 chapters, each chapter covering a particular type of bankruptcy. Of particular interest are Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcies. Chapter 7 deals with the liquidation of a company; Chapter 11 deals with the reorganization of a company.

Priority: Theory and practice When a company is liquidated, creditors receive distribution based on the absolute priority rule to the extent assets are available. The absolute priority rule holds that senior creditors are to be paid in full before junior creditors are paid anything. For secured creditors and unsecured creditors, this rule guarantees their seniority to equity holders.

In liquidations, the absolute priority rule generally holds. In contrast, a good body of literature argues that in reorganizations, strict absolute priority is not upheld by the courts or the SEC.[14] Studies of actual reorganizations under Chapter 11 find that the violation of absolute priority is the rule rather than the exception.[15]

Failure of the courts to follow strict absolute priority creates implications for the capital structure decision (i.e., the choice between debt and equity) of a firm. The view of financial economists that the firm is effectively owned by the creditors who sold the shareholders a call option on the firm's assets is not sustainable if the stockholders are not viewed as residual claimants.[16]

Several hypotheses have been suggested as to why, in a reorganization, the distribution made to claimants diverges from that required by the absolute priority principle. The incentive hypothesis argues that the longer the negotiation process among the parties continues, the greater will be the bankruptcy costs and the smaller the amount to be distributed to all parties. In a reorganization, a committee representing the various claim holders is appointed for the purpose of formulating a plan of reorganization. To be accepted, a plan of reorganization must be approved by the parties. Consequently, a lengthy bargaining process is expected. The longer the negotiation process among the parties takes, the more likely it is that the company will be operated in a manner not in the best interest of the creditors, and, as a result, the smaller will be the amount to be distributed to all parties. Because all impaired classes, including equity holders, generally must approve the plan of reorganization, creditors often convince equity holders to accept the plan by offering to distribute some value to them.

The recontracting process hypothesis argues that the violation of absolute priority reflects a recontracting process between stockholders and senior creditors that acknowledges the ability of management to preserve value on behalf of stockholders.[17] According to the stockholders' influence on reorganization plan hypothesis, creditors are less informed about the true economic operating conditions of the firm than is management. Because the distribution to creditors in the plan of reorganization is based on the valuation by the firm, creditors without perfect information suffer the loss.[18] According to Karen Hooper Wruck, managers generally have a better understanding than do creditors or stockholders of a firm's internal operations, whereas creditors and stockholders can have better information about industry trends. Management may therefore use its superior knowledge to present the data in a manner that reinforces its position.[19]

The essence of the strategic bargaining process hypothesis is that the increasing complexity of firms that declare bankruptcy accentuates the negotiating process and results in an even higher incidence of violation of the absolute priority rule. The likely outcome is further supported by the increased number of official committees in the reorganization process, as well as the increased number of financial and legal advisers.

Some observers have argued that creditors receive a higher value in reorganization than they would in liquidation, in part because of the costs associated with liquidation.[20] Finally, the lack of symmetry in the tax system (negative taxes are not permitted, although loss deductions may be carried forward) results in situations in which the only way to use all current loss deductions is to merge.[21] The tax system may encourage continuance or merger and discourage bankruptcy.

Consequently, although investors in the debt of a corporation may feel that they have priority over the equity owners and priority over other classes of debtors, the actual outcome of a bankruptcy may be far different from what the terms of the debt agreement state.

Fabozzi, Howe, Makabe, and Sudo examined the extent of violation of the absolute priority rule among three broad groups—secured creditors, unsecured creditors, and equity holders—and among various types of debt and equity securities.[22] They also provide evidence on which asset class bears the cost of violations of absolute priority, and an initial estimate of total distributed value relative to liquidation value. Their findings suggest that unsecured creditors bear a disproportionate cost of reorganization, senior unsecured creditors may bear a disproportionate cost relative to the junior unsecured creditors, and equity holders often benefit from violations of absolute priority.
