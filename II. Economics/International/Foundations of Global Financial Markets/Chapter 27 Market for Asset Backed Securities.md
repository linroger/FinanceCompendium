# Market for Asset-Backed Securities

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

- how asset-backed securities are created;
- the basic structure of a securitization;
- who the parties to a securitization are;
- how financial markets benefit from securitization;
- what is meant by originate-to-hold and originate-to-distribute approaches pursued by financial institutions;
- the concerns about securitization;
- how corporations can reduce funding costs via securitization;
- the role of the special-purpose vehicle;
- regulation of securitization resulting from the recent global financial crisis;
- the purpose of risk-retention rules in securitization regulation; and
- how corporations can use securitization to manage risks.

In this chapter, we focus on a vehicle used by financial and nonfinancial corporations for raising debt. This financial instrument, referred to as "asset-backed security," is created through a process referred to as asset securitization or simply securitization. The creation of securitized products was primarily done in the United States until the late 1980s, when it became a technique used in some European countries. One reason for the late development of securitized products outside the United States is that the process requires the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework that allows for the benefits of securitization. Although the major type of securitization that has taken place throughout the world involves the securitization of residential real estate mortgage loans, nonbanks and banks have created products backed by a wide range of non-real estate consumer loans and receivables. For example, banks and subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers have securitized automobile loans and leases.

In this chapter, we explain the securitization process and the types of bonds created by the process, the role of securitization in financial markets, and the public policy issues concerning securitization following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. This chapter provides an overview of securitization used by corporations. In chapter 30, we take a close look at a major sector of the securitization market, the market for securitized bonds backed by U.S. residential mortgage loans issued by a government agency and two government-sponsored enterprises. This market is so large that it warrants its own chapter.

To explain how a securitized product is created and the parties to a securitization, we will use an illustration. Suppose that FAF Lab Equipment Inc. manufactures high-quality equipment used by both medical and clinical laboratories throughout the world. Although the company has cash sales, the bulk of its sales come from installment sales contracts. An installment sale contract is a loan to the buyer of the laboratory equipment (e.g., a dental, medical, or clinical laboratory) wherein the buyer agrees to repay FAF Laboratory Equipment Inc. over a specified period of time for the amount borrowed plus interest. The laboratory equipment purchased is the collateral for the loan. We will assume that the loans are all for five years.

The credit department of FAF Lab Equipment Inc. makes the decision as to whether to extend credit to a customer. That is, the credit department receives a credit application from a potential customer and, based on criteria established by the company, decides whether to make a loan. The criteria for granting a loan are referred to as "underwriting standards." Because FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is granting the loan, the company is referred to as the originator of the loan.

Moreover, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. may have a department that is responsible for servicing the loan. Servicing involves collecting payments from borrowers, notifying borrowers who may be delinquent, and, when necessary, recovering and disposing of the collateral (the laboratory equipment, in our illustration) if the borrower fails to make the contractual loan payments. Although the servicer of the loans need not be the originator of the loans, in our illustration, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is the servicer.

Now let's get to how these loans are used in a securitization transaction. We assume that FAF Lab Equipment Inc. has more than $300 million of installment sales contracts. We further assume that FAF Lab Equipment Inc. wants to raise $300 million. Rather than issuing corporate bonds for 300 million, the treasurer of the corporation decides to raise the funds through a securitization. To do so, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. will set up a legal entity referred to as a special-purpose vehicle (SPV). At this point we will not explain the purpose of this legal entity, but it will become clear later that the SPV is critical in a securitization transaction.

In our illustration, the SPV that is set up is called "FAF Asset Trust" (FAFAT). FAF Lab Equipment Inc. will then sell to FAFAT $300 million of the loans. FAF Lab Equipment Inc. will receive from FAFAT $300 million in cash, the amount of funds it wanted to raise. FAFAT obtains the $300 million by selling securities that are backed by the $300 million of loans. The securities are the asset-backed securities mentioned above.

In the prospectus for a securitization issued in the United States, these securities are usually referred to as "certificates."

# The Parties to a Securitization

Let's clarify the parties to a securitization. In our hypothetical securitization, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is not the issuer of the securitized product (although it is sometimes referred to as the "issuer," because it is the entity that ultimately raises the funds). Instead, it originated the loans. Hence, in this transaction, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is referred to by different names: "seller" or "depositor" or "originator." The reason it is referred to as the "seller" is because it sells the receivables to FAFAT. It is referred to as the "depositor," because it deposits the receivables into the pool of loans. And FAF Lab Equipment Inc. may be referred to as the "originator," because it originated the receivables. In practice, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. might have a subsidiary that is a captive finance company whose responsibility is to finance the product of the parent company. In that case, the captive finance company would be the seller, depositor, or originator.

The SPV in a securitization is referred to as the "issuer" or in some countries, the "trust" in the prospectus. In our simple transaction, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. manufactured the lab equipment and originated the loans. The critical role of the SPV will be explained later.

There will be a trustee for the securities issued. The responsibilities of the trustee are to represent the interests of the bond classes by monitoring compliance with covenants and, in the event of default, to enforce remedies as specified in the governing documents.

The end result of a securitization is the creation of securities that are generically referred to as asset-backed securities (ABSs). In a securitization prospectus, ABSs are referred to as "certificates," "asset-backed notes," and "bond classes." In the market, the terminology often used to describe the securities created is "tranches."

A securitization has transaction structure. This refers to the securities created, the rules that set forth the way in which the losses are to be distributed among the securities in the structure, the rules for the distribution of interest each month among the securities in the structure, and the rules for the distribution of principal repayment among the securities in the structures. The rules are referred to as the structure "waterfall."

Let's look at some different types of structure, starting with a simple one using the FAF Lab Equipment Inc. sale of receivables to FAFAT—the SPV and issuer of the securities. Suppose in the bond structure there are three bond classes, A, B, and C. Recall that the total amount of the receivables in that hypothetical securitization transaction is $300 million and that the par amount of the bond classes sold is the same amount. Let's assume that the par value of bond class A is $260 million, bond class B is $30 million, and bond class C is $10 million, and that the rules for the distribution of the losses from the pool of receivables backing this securitization are as follows:

- Losses on the pool of receivables are first allocated to bond class C up to 10 million (the par amount of that bond class).
- Subsequent losses on the pool of receivables are then allocated to bond class B up to $30 million (the par amount of that bond class) above the $10 million loss absorbed by bond class C.
- Finally, should losses on the pool of receivables exceed 40 million, losses are then absorbed by bond class A.

For the distribution of principal when it is paid by the borrowers, the rules are:

- Pay bond class A with all principal received up to the amount of its par value (260 million).
- Once bond class A is fully repaid its par amount of $260 million, the principal received is distributed to bond class B up to its par value of $30 million.
- Finally, after bond class B is paid off, any additional principal is paid to bond class C.

Let's consider what happens under different situations with respect to losses on the pool of receivables. Suppose that the total loss for the pool of receivables over the life of the securities is $6 million. In this case, bond class A and bond class B will be repaid their par value in full. However, bond class C will absorb the loss of $6 million and therefore receive only $4 million of the $10 million par value. If the total loss for the pool of receivables over the life of the securities is $28 million, then bond class C receives no principal, and bond class A receives the entire principal. However, bond class B must absorb the loss above $10 million that is absorbed by bond class C. That amount is $18 million ($28 million - $10 million). Consequently, bond class B will receive only $12 million of its par value ($30 million - $18 million). Finally, let's consider the case where the loss is $60 million. In this case, neither bond class B nor bond class C will receive any principal, and bond class A must absorb the excess losses that the two other bond classes absorbed. That excess is $20 million (= $60 million - $10 million - $30 million), and therefore bond class A will receive $240 in principal rather than its par amount of 260 million.

Notice what has happened in this structure. Bond class C is providing credit support against losses from the pool of receivables for bond class A and bond class B up to $10 million. Moreover, bond class B is providing credit support against losses from the pool of receivables for bond class A up to an additional $30 million above that provided by bond class C. For this reason, we say that bond class B and bond class C are "subordinated" bond classes. Because bond class C is the first to absorb the losses, it is referred to as the "first-loss" piece. We also say that because bond class A is not providing credit support for the other two bond classes, it is the senior bond class. The structure itself is a senior-subordinated structure.

We discuss the credit risk and the senior-subordinated structure in the next section. Here we note only that each bond class will receive a credit rating. The senior bond class will receive the highest credit rating, and the two subordinated bond classes will receive lower credit ratings. More specifically, bond class B will receive a lower credit rating than bond class A but a higher credit rating than bond class C, because bond class B is being provided credit support by bond class C.

As should be apparent, the purpose of this structure is to redistribute the credit risk associated with the collateral (i.e., pool of receivables). This process is referred to as "credit tranching"—that is, a set of bond classes is created to allow investors a choice in the amount of credit risk they prefer to bear.

Let's add one more wrinkle to the structure. Suppose that the structure is as follows, where bond classes B and C are the subordinated bond classes, as in the previous structure, but there are four senior bond classes, A1, A2, A3, and A4:

<table><tr><td>Bond Class</td><td>Par Value ($ millions)</td></tr><tr><td>A1 (senior)</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>A2 (senior)</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>A3 (senior)</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>A4 (senior)</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>B (subordinated)</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>C (subordinated)</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>300</td></tr></table>

In this structure, the two subordinated bond classes, B and C, provide credit support for all senior bond classes. Once again we see credit tranching. In contrast to the prior structure, however, there is not one senior bond class but four. The rule for the distribution of principal payments to the senior bond classes is as follows:

- All principal is paid to bond class A1 until that bond class is paid its par value of 150 million.
- Once bond class A1 is paid off, then all principal is paid to bond class A2 until that bond class is paid its par value of 60 million.
- Once bond class A2 is paid off, then all principal is paid to bond class A3 until that bond class is paid its par value of 30 million.
- Once bond class A3 is paid off, then all principal is paid to bond class A4 until that bond class is paid its par value of 20 million.

Once all senior bonds are paid off, the rules for the distribution of principal are the same as in the prior structure:

- The principal received is distributed to bond class B up to its par value of 30 million.
- Finally, after bond class B is paid off, any additional principal is paid to bond class C.

In this example, it should be clear that the senior bond classes are not providing credit support for any other senior bond classes. Suppose that at the end of three years, the following situation exists:

1. There are no losses for the pool of receivables through year 3, but in the first month of year 4, the pool suffers a 60 million loss.
2. The principal paid to bond class A1 through year 3 is 70 million.

Thus as of the end of the first month in year 4, the two subordinated bond classes are wiped out (i.e., will not receive any principal). The principal due (before adjustment for the losses) is the same as when the securitization was issued, with the exception that bond class A1 has a par value that is reduced by the $60 million principal paid to that bond class. That is, the par value is $90 million ($150 million - $60 million). So we now have the following situation before the adjustment for the loss of receivables above and beyond what was allocated to the two bond classes:

<table><tr><td>Bond Class</td><td>Par Value ($ millions)</td></tr><tr><td>A1 (senior)</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>A2 (senior)</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>A3 (senior)</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>A4 (senior)</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>200</td></tr></table>

The four senior bond classes must be allocated the loss not absorbed by the two subordinate bond classes. That amount is $20 million: the loss of $60 million minus the $40 million that the two subordinated bond classes absorbed. Because the par value at the beginning of year 4 is $200 for all senior bond classes in total, that means each senior bond class has to be allocated 10% of the loss ($20 million to be allocated divided by $200 million in par value for the senior bonds). So the principal owed to each bond class is as follows:

<table><tr><td>Bond Class</td><td>Par Value ($ millions)</td></tr><tr><td>A1 (senior)</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>A2 (senior)</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>A3 (senior)</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>A4 (senior)</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>180</td></tr></table>

What was accomplished by carving up the senior bond into four bond classes that are paid off sequentially? Effectively, the senior bond class (bond class A) in the prior structure had a certain maturity. With the use of four senior bond classes, bonds with different maturities can be created (we'll see this in more detail in chapter 30). Consequently, carving up a senior bond class is referred to as time tranching (i.e., creating bonds with different maturities). Therefore, this structure has both time tranching for the senior bond class (through the creation of bond classes A1, A2, A3, and A4) and credit tranching (through the creation of the senior bond classes and the two subordinate bond classes B and C).

The first-loss piece (i.e., the first bond class to absorb losses from the collateral) is critical in a structure. As we'll see when we discuss the concerns about securitization, investors are concerned that the loans/receivables in the pool be properly underwritten. Because the originator of loans/receivables is not going to hold those assets on its balance sheet but instead will package those assets and distribute them to the public through a securitization, how does one control for this moral hazard problem (i.e., the poor underwriting of loans)?

In the United States and Europe, as explained later in this chapter, there are regulations requiring that originators retain in their portfolio the first-loss piece, for the purpose of placing originators at risk if they underwrite poor credit loans.

# Benefits of Securitization to Financial Markets

As we stress throughout this book, some vehicles have been introduced into financial markets to reduce the reliance of borrowers on banks. High-yield corporate bonds, the subject of chapter 26, are one example of such vehicles. Securitized bonds issued through the securitization process are another example.

Just before the onset of the global financial crisis, which can be traced back to the subprime mortgage crisis starting in the early summer of 2007—a crisis allegedly caused in part by securitization—major public officials in the United States were commenting on the critical role of securitization in the financial markets. For example, several months after the beginning of the financial crisis, then-U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Paulson, Jr., described securitization in a speech as "a process that has been extremely valuable in extending the availability of credit to millions of homeowners nationwide and lowering their cost of financing."[2]

On June 1, 2008, José Manuel González-Páramo, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank (the central bank for the Eurozone and the monetary policy administrator of the 17 EU countries), described the benefits of securitization for banks as follows:

The securitization of their loan portfolios has provided banks with access to an additional funding source and enabled them to mitigate some of the risks intrinsically related to their core business of liquidity transformation…. By allowing banks to transform their illiquid assets into marketable securities and providing an additional source of funding to expand lending, securitization provides an effective mechanism to mitigate such risks and reduces the role in liquidity transformation traditionally performed by depository banks.

Some observers think that in Asia, securitization will play an even more critical role than in the United States and Europe, for two reasons.4 First, in contrast to the developed bond markets in the United States and Europe, the Asian bond market is still underdeveloped. Second, funding by Asian companies is still highly dependent on banks. Securitization offers a means for developing the Asian bond and moving countries away from relying solely on the banking system. The same is true in Russia.

Finally, in January 2012, John Walsh, then acting U.S. comptroller of the currency, stated the following about securitization, which drives home the key point about its benefits:

Securitization is sometimes maligned and frequently misunderstood, and its importance to our nation's economy is often not fully appreciated. Whether in mortgages, credit cards, auto finance, or student loans, meeting the needs of American consumers depends heavily on securitization. It is hard to imagine full recovery of the financial system without the liquidity and funding avenues provided by a well functioning securitization market.[5]

It should be clear at this point that securitization plays a critical role in financial markets. Let's tie this observation into our earlier discussion of the important role of financial intermediation for a financial market, and more specifically, the three economic functions of financial intermediaries, which are (1) to provide maturity intermediation, (2) to reduce risk through diversification, and (3) to reduce the costs of contracting and information processing (see chapter 3). However, securitization is a vehicle for raising funds directly in the public market without the need for a financial intermediary. That is, securitization results in financial disintermediation.

Let's see how securitization can fulfill the three economic roles of financial intermediaries. First, a pool of loans can be used to create ABSs with different maturity ranges. For example, as explained earlier in this chapter, time tranching can be used to create securitized vehicles with maturities that are short, intermediate, and long term. (In chapter 30, we illustrate this principle with a pool of 30-year residential mortgage loans.) Hence, securitization provides maturity intermediation.

Second, diversification within an asset type is accomplished because of the large number of loans in a typical securitization. Hence, securitization reduces risk through diversification.

Finally, the costs of contracting and information processing are provided for in asset securitization. The contracting costs are provided by the originator of the loans. Information processing is provided at two levels. The first is when a loan is originated. The second is when a credit rating agency rates the individual ABSs in the transaction.

The key benefit of securitization to financial markets is that it allows the creation of tradable securities with better liquidity for financial claims that would otherwise have remained in the portfolio of financial intermediaries and would therefore be highly illiquid. For example, very few institutional or individual investors would be willing to invest in residential mortgage loans, automobile loans, or credit card receivables. Yet they would be willing to invest in a security backed by these loan types. By making financial assets tradable in this way, securitization (1) reduces agency costs, thereby making financial markets more efficient, and (2) improves liquidity for the underlying financial claims, thereby reducing liquidity risk in the financial system.

# Concerns about Securitization

The major benefits of securitization do not come without a significant potential risk. To understand the major risk, let's look at the traditional approach to lending followed by banks, and then be more specific and consider the process for originating loans to purchase residential property.

First we consider the approach taken by a bank when it originates a loan to purchase a property and, after origination, the bank retains the loan on its balance sheet. The approach is referred to as the "originate-to-hold" approach, with the "hold" meaning that the bank will retain the loan in its portfolio. In this approach, the bank's lending officer reviews an applicant's request for a loan. The applicant provides information about his or her credit history and employment history, as well as information about the property to be purchased. The lending officer retains the services of a competent appraiser (employed by the bank or an independent third party) to assess the property's attributes and obtain an appraised value. Based on the due diligence performed by the lending officer, the loan is either approved or denied. If approved, the loan is held in the bank's portfolio. The performance of the loan portfolio in terms of defaults is closely monitored by bank management, and problem loans in the portfolio are investigated. If it is determined that the lending officer or the appraiser failed to properly assess the credit risk of the loan, then action is taken against the individual or individuals responsible. Because the bank is at risk for the loans, it will exercise the necessary due diligence to minimize that risk.

Now let's consider the case involving securitization. This approach involves what is referred to as the "originate-to-distribute" approach. In this case, a bank may either originate loans with the intent to securitize them or the bank may purchase loans originated by other entities (e.g., acquired from mortgage banking firms that are subsidiaries of the bank). Employees of these other entities who originate loans, as well as the entities themselves, receive compensation from loans that are approved. Because the loans will be sold to a bank, which will then include those loans in a securitization and not hold them in its portfolio, the credit evaluation process breaks down. The entities originating the loans have an incentive to approve as many loans as possible to generate revenue from loans approved and for the bank not to re-underwrite the loans it purchases, because the loans will not be held by the bank. Instead, the bank generates fees associated with a securitization (i.e., earning a higher interest rate on the loans in the pool of loans backing a securitization than it has to pay to the investors in the securitized bonds). The economic incentives to originate as many loans as possible that can eventually be securitized without bearing the credit risk is the major concern that arises in securitization.

# Need for the Development of an Accommodating Legal Structure

A market for securitized products cannot efficiently develop until a legal structure is in place that can accommodate securitization. Here we explain the role of the SPV, the entity in a securitization that we have touched on only briefly. Indeed, without a provision equivalent to an SPV in the trust law of a country seeking to develop a market for securitized products, the benefits of securitization by an entity seeking to raise funds would be limited. Law based on case law or precedent is called "common law" and is based on judicial decisions. A trust is a relationship that involves one party holding property on behalf of another party, and it is also based on a common law system. In a securitization, therefore, a trust is created (the SPV), and the treatment of that trust is based on a country's common law system.

Role of the SPV

Let's illustrate this pivotal role of the SPV using our hypothetical case of FAF Lab Equipment Inc., a corporation that has a credit rating obtained from a credit rating agency. For illustrative purposes, let's suppose that the credit rating assigned to FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is single B. Such a credit rating means that FAF Lab Equipment Inc. has a noninvestment-grade rating.

Recall that the treasurer of FAF Lab Equipment Inc. wants to raise 300 million. One alternative is to issue a five-year corporate bond rather than use securitization to issue a securitized bond. A major concern of the firm's treasurer is the cost of borrowing (i.e., the interest rate) that would be paid on the corporate bond. The treasurer's primary objective is to obtain the lowest possible interest rate available. Interest rates or funding costs are measured as a spread over some benchmark. Let's suppose that the benchmark interest rate is the U.S. Treasury rate of the same maturity as the corporate bond that would be issued. Because we are assuming that the treasurer would issue a five-year corporate bond, the interest rate would be the five-year Treasury rate plus a spread, and that spread reflects the compensation investors want in order to be induced to purchase the corporate bond. The rating assigned to the corporate bond issue by the credit rating agency will be the major factor affecting the size of the spread. Another factor that influences the spread arising from credit risk is the collateral that might be used for the bond issue. As explained in chapter 26, a corporate bond that has collateral is a secured bond and would be expected to reduce the credit spread by a small amount compared to the spread on a corporate bond that has no collateral (i.e., an unsecured corporate bond). The treasurer can use the loans as collateral for the secured corporate bond offering. So if FAF Lab Equipment Inc. issues a five-year corporate bond to raise 300 million, then, with its credit rating of single B, the credit spread will reflect its credit rating primarily and the collateral slightly. We'll see why the collateral would have only a slight impact on the credit spread.

Now suppose that instead of using the loans to its customers as collateral for a secured corporate bond issue, the treasurer of FAF Lab Equipment Inc. undertakes a securitization by creating a legal entity and selling the contracts in an arm's-length transaction to that entity, the SPV, which we called "FAFAT" earlier in the chapter. In our illustration of the mechanics of a securitization, after the sale of the receivables by FAF Lab Equipment Inc. to FAFAT is completed, FAFAT legally owns the receivables, not FAF Lab Equipment Inc. As a result, if FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is ever forced into bankruptcy while the receivables sold are still outstanding, FAF Lab Equipment Inc.'s creditors cannot recover the receivables, because they are legally owned by FAFAT.

As a result of securitization, then, when the SPV (FAFAT, in our illustration) issues the securitized bonds that are backed by the cash flow from the pool of loans, investors contemplating the purchase of any bond class in the securitization structure will evaluate the credit risk associated with collecting the payments due on the receivables independent of FAF Lab Equipment Inc.'s credit rating.

The credit ratings will be assigned to the different bond classes created in the securitization and will reflect how the credit rating agencies evaluate the credit risk based on the expected performance of the collateral (i.e., the pool of loans). As a result of the SPV, the quality of the collateral, and the capital structure of the SPV (i.e., the number of senior and subordinated bond classes), a corporation can raise funds through a securitization in which some of the bond classes have a better credit rating than the corporation itself that is seeking to raise funds. And so in the aggregate, the funding cost is less than that of issuing a secured corporate bond. This is the key role of the SPV in a securitization.

It is important to understand why a securitization may have a lower funding cost than a corporate bond secured by the same collateral as the securitization. The reason lies in the treatment of secured creditors in the case of a corporate reorganization in many countries. In the United States, for example, during the liquidation of a corporation, the absolute priority rule dictates how the bankrupt corporation's assets are to be distributed among creditors and stockholders (see chapter 26). The absolute priority rule is the principle that senior creditors are paid in full before junior creditors are paid anything. For secured creditors and unsecured creditors, the absolute priority rule guarantees their seniority to equity holders. In liquidations, the absolute priority rule generally holds. In contrast, it is well documented that in actual reorganizations, the courts have not followed strict absolute priority rules when distributing assets. Consequently, although investors in the debt of a corporation may feel they have priority over the equity owners and priority over other classes of debtholders, in practice, the actual outcome of a bankruptcy may deviate greatly from the terms of the debt agreement. That is, there is no assurance that if a corporate bond has collateral (i.e., is a secured bond), the rights of the debtholders will be respected should a reorganization occur. It is for this reason that the credit spread does not decrease dramatically for a secured bond compared to that for an unsecured bond. In contrast, for a securitization, the courts have no discretion. This is because no bankruptcy takes place. Instead, there are only rules (i.e., the "waterfall," or the rules for distributing losses, interest, and repayment of principal among the securities in a structure) that the trustee must follow when cash flow is received from the pool of loans. Those rules specify how the losses are to be absorbed by each bond class in the securitization's capital structure.

An actual example of the cost reduction benefit of securitization should make this clear. Our example is that of Ford Motor Company, an automobile manufacturer. Beginning in 2000, there were concerns that the credit rating of Ford would be downgraded. The company has a captive finance company, Ford Motor Credit, whose credit rating would also be downgraded. However, the captive finance company had the ability to securitize its auto loans to customers, and it issued a securitized bond. What

Ford Motor Credit did was reduce its exposure from $42 billion to $8 billion of standard corporate bond issuance, substituting the sale of securitized automobile loans that carried the highest credit rating, triple A. In fact, from 2000 to mid-2003, Ford Motor Credit increased securitizations to $55 billion (28% of its total funding) from $25 billion (13% of its total funding). Also, even though the credit ratings of not only Ford Motor Company but also the other major auto manufacturers were downgraded in May 2005, the credit ratings on several of the securitization transactions of these automobile manufacturers were not downgraded. In fact, some were upgraded.

Understanding this important decoupling of the credit risk of the entity needing funds and the bond classes issued by the SPV should make it clear that the SPV's legal role is critical. This occurs in the United States because of the treatment of SPVs by the legal system. That is, despite several challenges that have occurred (discussed next), the assets in a properly structured securitization belong to the SPV, not to the entity that sold the assets to the SPV in exchange for funds.

However, other countries may not have the same legal framework as the United States. This is why outside the United States, there have been impediments in some countries with respect to the issuance of securitized bonds created from a securitization, because the concept of trust law does not exist.

Legal Challenge in the United States

The long-standing view is that investors in ABSs are protected from the creditors of the seller of the collateral. That is, when the seller of the collateral transfers it to the trust (the SPV), the transfer represents a "true sale," and therefore, in case of the seller's bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court cannot penetrate the trust to recover the collateral or cash flow from the collateral. However, this issue has never been fully tested. The closest challenge was the bankruptcy of LTV Steel Company. In the bankruptcy, LTV argued that its securitizations were not true sales and therefore it should be entitled to the cash flows it had transferred to the trust. Although the case was settled and the settlement included a summary finding that

LTV's securitizations were a true sale, the court's decision to permit LTV to use the cash flows prior to the settlement is a major concern for investors.

# Securitization Regulation

The abuses and problems identified by the global financial crisis led to one of the most significant changes in the regulation of financial markets throughout the world. Although the abuses were due to the securitization of real estate loans (which we describe in chapter 30) and collateralized debt obligation (securitization technology applied to the pooling of debt instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities and certain types of ABSs), the postcrisis financial regulations apply to securitization in general.

Steven Schwarzz classifies the regulations dealing with securitization into four categories: increasing disclosure, requiring risk retention, reforming credit rating agencies, and imposing capital requirements. The last category involves rules with respect to risk-backed capital requirement described in chapter 6. Reforming credit rating agencies was included by regulators because of the questionable practices of these entities when rating certain types of mortgage-backed securities.

In the United States, the primary regulation is provided for in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of July 2010, which amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). This legislation, referred to simply as the "Dodd-Frank Act," deals with more issues than just the regulation of securitizations in the United States. However, we will focus here only on that part of the Dodd-Frank Act dealing with securitization. Although Congress passed the act in mid-2010, implementation of the act's provisions was delegated to various government agencies: the SEC, the three federal banking agencies (the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC), the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The Dodd-Frank Act refers to the entity that does a securitization as the "securitizer" and defines a securitizer or sponsor of a securitization as "a person who organizes and initiates an asset-backed securities transaction by selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuer." An ABS is generally defined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be "a fixed income or other security collateralized by any type of self-liquidating financial asset (including a loan, lease, mortgage, or other secured or unsecured receivable) that allows the holder of the security to receive payments that depend primarily on cash flow from the asset."

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to adopt several rules regarding securitization. These rules deal with

- reporting standards and disclosure for a securitization transaction in an ABS prospectus;
- the representations and warranties required to be provided in securitization transactions and the mechanisms for enforcing them; and
- due diligence requirements with respect to the loans underlying the securitization transactions.

The importance of the last rule should be clear from what we discussed in the chapter regarding the need for better underwriting standards when loans are to be distributed through a securitization.

Section 941 of the of the Dodd-Frank Act deals with another key element to mitigate the risks associated with shoddy underwriting of loans and receivables included in a securitization. The basic principle underlying Section 941 is that the issuer should hold enough economic interest in the securitization transaction so that failure to properly perform due diligence on the loans or receivables will have an adverse impact on the securitizer. This is done by having the securitizer hold a meaningful portion of the bond classes issued. The rule addressing this issue is referred to as the "risk retention rule." The rule is designed to ensure that the amount of credit risk retained by the securitizer would be economically meaningful while at the same time reducing the potential for the risk retention rule to adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to consumers and businesses.[7]

The European Parliament and Council proposed regulations in September 2015 that set forth rules dealing with securitization. In addition, this entity created a European framework for simple, transparent, and standardized securitization. There are risk-retention rules under the proposed EU regulations just as in the United States.

# Securitization as a Corporate Risk Management Tool

In the previous section, we explained why securitization offers the corporate issuer the potential to reduce funding costs. Moreover, it allows corporate issuers to diversify their funding sources. As stated by Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, a captive finance subsidiary of Toyota, in its filing with the U.S. SEC: "Asset-backed securitization of our earning asset portfolio provides us with an alternative source of funding."[8]

Beyond the potential funding benefits is another important benefit from securitization: it can be used as a corporate risk management tool. More specifically, it can be used to manage (1) interest rate risk, (2) credit risk, and (3) other risks associated with the collateral.

First let's consider interest rate risk. The loans or receivables backing a securitization are debt obligations or fixed income instruments. Consequently, if the loans or receivables remain on the books of the originator, their value declines if interest rates increase. That is, the originator of the portfolio of loans or receivables is exposed to interest rate risk. However, if that portfolio of loans or receivables is removed from the originator's balance sheet by being used as collateral for a securitization, the originator no longer is exposed to the interest rate risk associated with those loans or receivables.

Second, the credit risk associated with the portfolio of loans and receivables is removed. To understand why, consider once again Ford Motor Company and its captive finance subsidiary, Ford Motor Credit. Since 2000, Ford Motor Credit has used securitization to reduce its portfolio of automobile loans. By doing so, it has reduced its exposure to the credit risk associated with those loans (i.e., the risk that the borrower will default). At the end of 2001, Ford Motor Credit carried $208 million in auto loans and realized first quarter credit losses of $912 million. By 2003, credit losses for the first quarter had declined to $493 million, with loans on the balance sheet down by $28 million to 180 million.

Third, consider managing the other risks associated with a portfolio of loans or receivables. Let's look once again at securitization as done in the automobile industry. As explained later in this chapter, not only are loans used in a securitization, so also are leases (the asset being lease receivables). In an automobile lease, the user of the automobile (referred to as the "lessee") makes payments to the owner of the automobile (called the "lessor") over the term of the lease. At the end of the lease term, the lessee has the option either to buy the automobile at a predetermined fixed price or to return it to the lessor. The market value of the leased automobile at the end of the lease term is referred to as its "residual value." The lessee's decision at the end of the lease term depends on the market value of the automobile compared to the predetermined fixed price set forth in the lease agreement. If the market value is less than the predetermined fixed price, the lessee will return to the automobile to the lessor. The lessor therefore then owns a portfolio of automobiles whose market value is below what was expected when the leases were originated. This risk in a lease transaction from the perspective of the lessor or originator is called "residual risk." This risk is removed when a securitization is created, because the risk is passed on to the investors in the securitized bonds.

# Key Points
- Asset securitization (or simply, "securitization") plays a critical role in the financial markets and the real economy.
- The end result of a securitization is the creation of securities that are generically referred to as asset-backed securities (ABSs) or bond classes or tranches that are backed by a pool of loans or receivables.
- The main parties to a securitization are the seller/originator (the party seeking to raise funds), a special-purpose vehicle (SPV), and the servicer.
- Securitization has resulted in financial disintermediation.
- The motivation for an entity seeking funds to issue ABSs rather than a corporate bond is the potential reduction in funding cost.
- The key to the potentially lower funding cost that may arise from a securitization is the role of the SPV.
- In a securitization, the transaction structure or "waterfall" refers to the securities created, the rules that set forth the way in which the losses are to be distributed among the securities in the structure, the rules for the distribution of interest each month among the securities in the structure, and the rules for the distribution of principal repayment among the securities in the structure.
- ABSs are credit enhanced to provide greater protection to bond classes against defaults.
- In a senior-subordinated structure, the credit support for the senior bonds is provided by the subordinated bonds.
- The senior bond class will receive a higher credit rating than the subordinated bond classes.
- The purpose of the senior-subordinated structure is to redistribute the credit risk associated with the collateral (i.e., pool of receivables); the redistribution is referred to as "credit tranching."
- The senior-subordinated structure allows investors a choice in the amount of credit risk they prefer to bear.
- The senior bond class can be branched further to create bonds with different maturities, referred to as "time tranching," allowing investors a choice of maturity.
- Securitization plays a critical role in financial markets in terms of the three functions that have historically been provided by financial intermediation: (1) providing maturity intermediation; (2) reducing risk through diversification; and (3) reducing the costs of transacting and information processing.
- Securitization is a fundraising vehicle, with funds raised directly in the public market without the need for a financial intermediary, and hence results in financial disintermediation.
- The key benefit of securitization to financial markets is that it allows the creation of tradable securities with better liquidity for financial claims that would otherwise have remained in the portfolio of financial intermediaries and therefore would be highly illiquid.
- The two approaches that a bank originating loans can follow are originate to hold and originate to distribute.
- Securitization is the originate-to-distribute approach.
- Securitization raises concerns of moral hazard (i.e., poor underwriting standards in loan origination) because originators of loans/receivables are not going to hold those assets on their balance sheet (i.e., originate to hold) but instead will pool them and distribute securities backed by the pool of loans to the public.
- The economic incentives to originate as many loans as possible that can then eventually be securitized without the originator bearing the credit risk is the major concern about securitization.
- Legislation in the United States has sought to mitigate the moral hazard problem in the origination of loans associated with securitization.
- A market for securitized products cannot efficiently develop until a legal structure is in place that can accommodate securitization.
- Without a provision equivalent to an SPV in a country's trust law, the benefits of using securitization by an entity seeking to raise funds are limited.
- The SPV allows decoupling of the credit risk of the entity needing funds and the bond classes issued through the securitization (where the SPV is the issuer).
- Regulations dealing with securitization in the United States and the European Union fall into four categories: increasing disclosure, requiring risk retention, reforming credit rating agencies, and imposing capital requirements.
- The abuses and problems associated with securitization identified by the global financial crisis were addressed in the United States by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which required the SEC to adopt several rules regarding securitization.
- In addition to the opportunity to raise funds at a lower cost through securitization, securitization offers corporate issuers the ability to diversify funding sources and a vehicle for transferring risk (i.e., it is a corporate risk management tool).
