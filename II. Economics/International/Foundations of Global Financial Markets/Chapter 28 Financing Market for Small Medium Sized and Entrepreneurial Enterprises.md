In the market for business financing, much of the focus in financial markets is on the sources for funding publicly traded companies and the characteristics of the financial instruments that they can use. Yet there is considerable evidence that growth of a country's real economy is tied to innovations in its product and service markets. These innovations create jobs. Often, such innovations result from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startup companies. In many countries, firms classified as SMEs are a large share of businesses, but a much smaller share of the country's GDP. For example, it is estimated that in the European Union, about  $90\%$  of all businesses fall into what would be classified as an SME. In Japan, about 4.69 million enterprises are classified as SMEs, representing  $99.7\%$  of all enterprises and employing  $70\%$  of the workforce. One of the most successful countries that has transitioned from one the world's poorest countries to twelveth largest economy in terms of GDP is the Republic of Korea, where  $99.9\%$  of all companies are SMEs, accounting for  $87.7\%$  of all employees. $^{1}$

The specific definition of what an SME is varies from country to country. Although economists have argued that the link between SMEs and a country's economic growth is not a simple one (and, in fact, may be a weak link), governments view SMEs and new ventures as important components of their economy and have instituted laws to support financing for these business entities. This view about supporting SMEs is shared by supranationals (such as the World Bank) and central banks.

In this chapter, we describe the markets for financing SMEs and new ventures as well as the financing instruments used by new ventures.

# Definition of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises

There is no universal definition of what an SME is. The definition is important, because it may impact the ability of an enterprise to qualify for access to financing programs in a country and those available from suprionals. In a country, it may impact an enterprise's tax status and regulatory treatment.

The national governments and international organizations establish their own guidelines for defining an SME. Typically this definition is based one or more of the following metrics: number of employees, level of sales (revenue), or total assets. Table 28.1 shows the definition for an SME in terms of the three metrics for three countries (Australia, Canada, and the United States), the European Union, and three supranationals (the World Bank, the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank, and the African Development Bank). As can be seen, there is considerable variation in how an SME is defined. Moreover, emerging countries have even greater variation in their definitions of an SME.

# Government Programs and Initiatives

It is well known that the financing market available to SMEs is characterized by market failures and market imperfections. The failure of the market system to provide funding for SMEs as a result of the global financial crisis that began in 2008 has highlighted this shortcoming. Market imperfections in this market has resulted in information asymmetries and high transaction costs for the small loan size typically sought by SMEs. These undesirable characteristics of this market leads to a suboptimal allocation of capital. Recognizing the importance of SMEs and new ventures to the growth of their economies, governments and regional bodies have developed policies for making access to financing easier for these enterprises while also protecting investors. The failure of governments to intervene to support SMEs and entrepreneurial ventures in the manufacturing sector, for example, has lead to two adverse impacts. The first is an underinvestment in research and development (R&D) that can impede the creation of new jobs and products. The second is that because SME manufacturers are less likely than larger firms to implement and adopt new technology and to invest in worker training and education, SME productivity improvements are slower than they would be with government support.

A 2011 report by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation identified and analyzed support programs and practices for SME manufacturing companies implemented in 11 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Focusing on the manufacturing sector, more and more countries have introduced and funded agencies, programs, and policy instruments supporting SME manufacturers to enhance their global competitiveness, productivity, and innovation capacity. According to John Ezell and Robert Atkinson, coauthors of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation's study, these government initiatives seek to

1. Mentor and train SME manufacturers in continuously improving their processes and operational performance by adopting lean or quality manufacturing principles and new manufacturing process technologies;
2. Promote the diffusion of new technologies and knowledge from universities, national laboratories, or public research institutes to SME manufacturers;
3. Help SME manufacturers innovate new products and services by supporting their R&D and new product development efforts; or
4. Address gaps in SME manufacturers' access to financing for their R&D and innovation activities.

The European Union's "Small Business Act" for Europe is its major policy initiative supporting SMEs, providing a comprehensive framework to promote entrepreneurship and strengthening the competitiveness of European SMEs. The act focuses on three areas: (1) improving access to finance, (2) formulating prudent regulation, and (3) taking advantage of the single market concept that the European Union seeks to establish. To improve SME access to finance, the act deals with financial instruments that can be used to facilitate the raising of venture capital investments and provides guarantees for lending to SMEs. Furthermore, the European Commission established a permanent SME Finance Forum that brings together representatives of the SME community, banks, and other financial institutions, including the European Investment Bank. The purpose of the SME Finance Forum is to tackle the various obstacles faced by SMEs seeking to obtain credit.

As we discuss the varying funding sources later this chapter, we'll give examples of government programs, agencies, and initiatives.

# Stages of Development and Financing for a Business Venture

Below we describe the stages of a privately held company in terms of the milestones achieved, according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. This categorization of a business venture is important for understanding the sources of financing available to entrepreneurs.

The American Association of Certified Public Accountants provides the following six stages of development and financing:

- **Stage 1:** In this stage, the venture is typically characterized as follows: founders have an idea, but no product revenue has been generated and possibly product development is in the initial phase. This stage might be best described as the pre-commercialization stage or pre-marketing stage. In terms of technology, the company is in early stage technology: technology that is not yet commercialized and has not been proven beyond the drawing board (i.e., nothing beyond laboratory experiments). In fact, neither the basic research nor the commercial feasibility may have been completed. Every new high-tech product requires an extensive pre-commercialization stage. For some companies, the legal structure may not have been decided on by the founders, because no decision may yet have been made to proceed with the formal formation of a company. Consequently, the founders' financing needs can vary, based on the costs associated with (1) conducting of business feasibility studies, (2) building prototypes, (3) testing and validating the offering, (4) evaluating the market potential, and (5) filing the legal documents to protect the intellectual property developed. Financing is seed capital financing at the early phase of this stage and first round financing or series A financing in the late phase of this stage.
- **Stage 2:** No product revenue but considerable expenses characterize this stage. Product development has begun, and the founder team is identifying and managing new business challenges as they arise. It is at this stage that venture capitalists provide secondor third-round financing. The founders need further guidance on management strategies for growing the business, so that in addition to capital, the new venture needs expertise and relationship building (partnerships) that can be provided by suppliers of capital, such as venture capitalists.
- **Stage 3:** Typically, the venture is still operating at a loss due to a lack of revenue generation. But it has made significant advances in product development, such as the completion of alpha and beta testing of its offering. The venture is further increasing its value by reaching other key milestones, such as the hiring of a management team.
- **Stage 4:** Although still operating at loss, typically milestones have been reached regarding the product, and there is customer validation in the form of first orders and first shipments. As a result, some revenue has been generated. The new venture can now be viewed as being in the expansion stage, because the venture now has to expand its operations, hopefully improving its production process, improving its product, and investing in more costly marketing efforts. The company has surpassed a sufficient number of key nonfinancial milestones to consider the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO).
- **Stage 5:** The general level of product revenue allows the venture to reach key financial milestones, such as break-even operations, operating profitability, or positive cash flows. It is possible for some type of exit event to occur—possibly an IPO or the sale of the company.
- **Stage 6:** If an exit event has not occurred by this stage, the company has a sufficiently strong financial and operational track record to make it a strong candidate for acquisition.

This general description of the stages of business development and financing is not carved in stone. No two ventures have the same rate of growth of revenue and product development. Therefore they have different capital needs that do not fall neatly into the stages described above. The conventions characterizing the stages in the literature can vary even among venture capitalists. For example, suppose that a new venture's founders do not seek funding for what we described above as seed capital until it has developed a prototype for its product. A venture capitalist that provides financing for this new venture might indeed classify this investment as seed capital; however, another venture capitalist might classify it as early startup financing. What is important is not the specific nomenclature used but understanding what types of financing are needed as the business develops.

For purposes of describing the various funding sources available for new venture financing, prior to the hopeful liquidation of a company resulting from either an acquisition, a merger, or an IPO, we can simplify those six stages into two broader stages of financing: early stage financing and expansion stage financing.

Early stage financing includes Stage 1 of the six stages described above. In turn, this can be divided into two phases: the seed round and first round. In the seed round, the founders seek to finance the development of a product or service (i.e., its offerings). Typically, there has not been the commercialization of the intended offerings, and hence, this stage of financing is sometimes referred to as the pre-commercialization financing stage. In addition to administrative costs, the major costs incurred are for developing a customer base, developing a prototype of the offering, and market testing. It may be necessary to hire technical staff, such as engineers, scientists, and software developers, particularly for high-tech companies. For investors, this is the stage of a startup that has the greatest risks and therefore should offer the greatest rewards.

Usually, funding in the very early stages comes primarily through the use by the founders of whatever cash they can obtain from personal savings, refinancing a home, using a home as collateral for a second mortgage, cashing out on a life insurance policy, and from a personal bank loan (as opposed to a business bank loan). Some founders will start a business while still employed by other organizations and use their salaries to help fund the new business. Using these sources of funding by founders is referred to as bootstrap financing. Other sources of funding at this stage may come from the personal assets of the family members and friends, the prudent use of credit cards, and the strategic use of vendor financing.

Probably the best-known use of credit card financing was by the founders of Google. While doctoral students in the computer science department at Stanford University in the mid-1990s, the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, financed the company in its first two years of operation with the prudent use of credit cards. Carefully watching spending limits, they used credit cards to purchase used computers and software.[6] Another example is Charles Huang, the designer of "Guitar Hero III: Legends of the Rock," who in 2007 used credit cards to finance his company.[7] Credit card financing is a form of debt financing and has the risks associated with using debt. The advantage of credit card financing is the ease with which founders with a good credit rating can obtain multiple credit cards with generous lines of credit.

The use of suppliers to provide funding for the purchase of equipment, material needed for production, and services needed for production is known as vendor financing or trade credit. The benefit to vendors is that offering attractive trade credit terms can stimulate sales, and vendors do compete on the trade credit terms that they provide. Trade credit works as follows. Suppose the founders of a company make a purchase from a vendor. The vendor might give the founders a specified period to make the payment and if made within the designated period, the founders are permitted to take a discount from the invoice price. The period in which the founders are entitled to take the discount is called the "discount period." Once the discount period passes, the company must pay the full invoice price. If the discount is not taken, vendor financing becomes another form of debt financing, and it, too, comes with a cost, although there is no stated interest rate. Instead, there is an implicit interest rate that should be estimated before using this form of debt financing and compared to alternative forms of financing.

After the above sources are exhausted, management will seek other sources. First round financing is commonly referred to as the Series A round or simply A financing. The milestone that has been reached at this stage is the generation of revenue. Neither break-even operations nor a profit are typically reached at this stage. Although the risk of first round investors is still considerable, it is less than that for investors in the seed round. The most common source of funding at the Series A round is venture capitalists, which we describe later in this chapter.

In the seed stage, it is difficult for founders to obtain debt financing from banks in the form of loans except when the founders have sufficient collateral or assets to provide personal guarantees. Nor has the startup generated sufficient cash flow to justify a business loan. However, once first round financing is obtained from venture capitalists, there are specialty banks and non-bank entities that are willing to provide such loans. These loans are referred to as venture debt and contain an equity kicker for the lender in the form of warrants.

Expansion stage financing includes the last five stages of business development and financing described above. It is funding for the purpose of expanding the company's business by expanding production and acquiring customers based on its marketing strategy. Financing here includes bridge loans, second round financing (also called Series B round), third round financing (also called Series C round), and so on. Additional rounds of financing may be necessary if the company does not have a liquidating event after several rounds of financing. As explained later in this chapter, the entry of a new investor group, institutional investors, has allowed ventures to raise funds via an IPO, which provides substantial funds for a company to expand without the need to go public.

# Sources for Seed Stage Financing

After the abovementioned sources are exhausted, seed finance can come from one or more of the following: government-supported funding via agencies, programs, and initiatives; angel investors, angel groups, and super angels; and seed accelerators.

# Government-Supported Funding Programs

National governments have recognized the need to support SMEs and new venture enterprises for the reasons described earlier in this chapter. The types of government-supported funding programs that have been used by countries make financing more accessible to SMEs and new ventures are loan guarantees, direct credit loans, loan subsidies, grant programs, and preferable tax treatment for lenders to SMEs. In 2008, the World Bank reported the results of a study on bank financing for SMEs in developed and developing countires. $^{8}$  One focus of the survey, which included 91 banks, is on the role of government loan programs. The study found that six of the seven developed countries and 32 of the 45 developing countries had government programs to foster financing for SMEs. The study concluded that guarantee programs are the most common government program used by developed and developing countries to support SME financing. The second most popular program in developed programs was interest rate subsidies. In contrast, for developing countries, the second most common program was direct credit programs.

Types of funding arrangements Loan guarantees (or credit guarantees) are not direct loans by a government to SMEs. Instead, the loans are made by private financial institutions with guarantees from the sponsoring government. The guarantee can cover the entire amount borrowed or just a specified portion of it. Because the sponsoring government and the private financial institution share the risk associated with default by borrowers, such programs are referred to as "risk-sharing" or "cost-sharing" programs. This is the SME financing support model used in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Direct credit loans are loans made by the sponsoring government to an SME. The government is at risk for the entire amount of the loan. Canada's SME funding program is primarily a direct credit program. There are also loans with an interest rate subsidy and outright government grant programs.

Preferable tax treatment involves a range of tax reliefs provided for qualified SMEs and new ventures. Tax relief can be in the form of a lower tax rate for qualifying entities or even a tax holiday (i.e., no tax for a designated period) and/or a tax credit which is dollar for dollar in the tax liability.[9] France has a wide range of tax benefits targeting SMEs. Although many countries provide tax credits for various reasons, France has a specified R&D tax credit for SMEs. The credit features a full exemption from the corporate income tax in the first fiscal year. In the United Kingdom, the Seed and Enterprise Investment Schemes provide tax relief in different forms to encourage investors to acquire equity in qualifying early stage companies and small high-risk companies. The United Kingdom's Small Business Rates Relief also provides tax benefits.

Here we describe the government supported-government supplied by some countries.

In the United States, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is an independent agency of the U.S. government created by the Small Business Act of 1953 with the mission to "aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of small business concerns, to preserve free competitive enterprise and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of our nation."10 In the programs available from the SBA, the agency is not the lender. Participating banks and other lenders make the loans with a large portion the loans guaranteed by the SBA.

The Japanese have long recognized the importance of SMEs and have passed legislation and founded agencies aimed at supporting SMEs, backing their efforts to start new enterprises or open new product markets.[11] For example, in 1948, the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency was established. As the Japanese economy grew rapidly in the 1960s, the "SME Basic Act" was passed in 1963 to deal with disparities between SMEs and large corporations. The SME Basic Act was revised in 1999 and 2013.[12] Japan responded by strengthening the financing function of government-affiliated financial institutions, including the Japan Finance Corporation for Small and Medium Enterprise established in 1953, the National Life Finance Corporation, and the Shoko Chukin Bank.

As noted at the start of this chapter, the Republic of Korea has made an amazing transition from one of the world's poorest countries with most of the country's employees working in SMEs. To accomplish economic growth, the government supported funding for SMEs, increasing that support during the global financial crisis. The financing framework for Korea includes (1) the central government via its Small & Medium Business Corporation, the Korea Finance Corporation, the Credit Guarantee Fund, and the Korea Technology Credit Guarantee Fund; (2) Bank of Korea; and (3) local governments. For example, the central government uses its Small & Medium Business Corporation to make direct and indirect loans through Korean financial institutions. The local government support is in the form of credit guarantees and interest rate subsidies.

Angel Investors, Angel Groups, and Super Angels

After founders have exhausted funding sources from their personal assets and those of family and friends, and before venture capitalists have stepped up to provide funding, the primary source of funding early-stage funding is so-called angel investors. In Europe, angels are referred to as "business angels." The European Business Angel Network defines business angels as follows:

A business angel is an individual investor (qualified as defined by some national regulations) that invests directly (or through their personal holding) their own money predominantly in seed or startup companies with no family relationships. Business angels make their own (final) investment decisions and are financially independent, i.e., a possible total loss of their business angel investments will not significantly change the economic situation of their assets. BAs invest with a medium to long term set time-frame and are ready to provide, on top of their individual investment, follow-up strategic support to entrepreneurs from investment to exit.[13]

This definition mentions "qualified as defined by national regulations." In the United States, for example, angel investing is available to individuals who qualify under the SEC's definition of "accredited investors."

The funding vehicles used are typically convertible securities, which we describe later in this chapter. In addition to providing funding, angel investors provide strategic planning advice, assist in team building, and provide contacts for developing key partnerships and further fundraising.

In the United States, there are approximately 270,000 active angel investors.[14] According to Forbes, individuals who are the most active angel investors include Jeff Bezos (founder, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board of Amazon.com), Paul Buchheit and Paul Graham (partners at Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley-based seed accelerator), Jean-François Clavier (founder and managing partner of SoftTech VC), and David Lee (founder and managing member at SV Angel, LLC). It is estimated that in 2012, angel investors invested about  $23 billion in more than 67,000 startup companies, representing nearly 90\%$  of the outside capital for these ventures. Compared to venture capital firms, angel investors provided funding for roughly 20 times more startups, even though venture capital firms invested 27 billion.[15] Although venture capitalists are credited with success stories such as Apple, AOL, Amazon.com, Facebook, and Google, for seed stage financing, these companies all relied on angel financing.

In Europe, it is estimated that there are about 75,000 business angels as of 2010.[16] Business angels are even more important than in the United States because of the absence of venture capitalists in some European countries and the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, which has resulted in less bank lending and venture capital investment. Consequently, in such countries, business angels are the major source of equity funding for seed and startup enterprises. Compared to angel investing in the United States, European business angel investing is still in its infancy. The amount invested by business angels in the European Union is estimated to be €3–5 billion per year as of 2010 (compared to 20 billion in the United States) and in far fewer companies: 2,800 in the European Union compared to 62,000 in the United States.[17]

Since the mid-1990s, angel investors typically have invested through groups or networks. Some of the groups specialize in particular industries and may restrict their investments to particular regions of the country. Angel investors enjoy four benefits from forming an angel group to collectively evaluate and invest in startups. First, pooling of funds allows for investing in more startups that, at least in theory, provides for risk reduction via diversification. Second, the cost of information gathering and contracting can be shared among members of the group. Third, the diverse expertise of members of the angel group reduce the risk of not taking into account key factors that may lead to potentially good ventures being overlooked. Finally, the greater name recognition of a group of wealthy individuals, as opposed to a single individual, is likely to result in more deals being made. From an angel investor's perspective, a disadvantage of participating in (i.e., becoming a member of) an angel group is the time commitment required. Members must attend events, particularly participation in the screening of deals.

The Angel Capital Association, a trade association that supports the American professional angel community, publishes an annual report on the state of the industry. The report is titled the Halo Report. According to the 2017 Halo Report,  $63\%$  of angel group deals were concentrated in three sectors: software  $(27\%)$ , consumer products and services  $(21\%)$ , and healthcare  $(15\%)$ . While in prior years internet and mobile companies dominated the deals, in 2017 these two sectors dropped from  $11.2\%$  to  $4.48\%$  of the deals.[18] In addition, this issue of the Halo Report states that the median round size was  $270,000 with an average size of$ 637,000. According to the report, the five largest angel groups in 2017 are Keiretsu

Forum, Houston Angel Network, Y Combinations, Central Texas Angel Network, and New York Angels.

Although venture capitalists invest primarily in first round financing, some venture capital firms do provide seed financing. These firms, referred to as super angels, are set up as private equity firms. (A description of private equity firms is provided when we describe venture capital firms later in this chapter.) They differ from traditional venture capital firms in that the amount that can be raised from super angels is less.

One study investigated the role of funding for high-growth startup firms by angel investors in terms of the growth, survival, and access to follow-up funding.[19] The four key findings of the study are:

1. The success of a startup is highly correlated to the level of interest that angel investors exhibit during the initial presentation and by the follow-up due diligence performed by angel investors.
2. Startups are more likely to survive at least four years if they have angel funding.
3. Startups are more likely to raise follow-up funding outside the angel group if they obtain funding from angel investors
4. Startup performance and growth is more likely to improve if the startup obtains angel investor funding.

Moreover, the study finds that it may not be access to capital per se that angel groups provide entrepreneurs of startup firms. Instead, it may be the benefits of advising and furnishing business contacts that are of greatest value.

There is disagreement as to whether angel investors earn attractive returns from the ventures in which they invest.[20] As Robert Wiltbank of Willamette University observes:

The investing world seemed certain that angel investors were rubes. Conventional wisdom dictated that they made reckless investments in very early-stage ventures mostly doomed to fail. And whenever they might come close to succeeding, savvy "professional" investors would just swoop in, cram them down, and win the real returns. In addition, angels were up against a selection problem: All the best entrepreneurs and opportunities would naturally gravitate to the best venture capital funds, leaving only the "scaps" for angel investors.[21]

Wiltbank and Boeker studied the returns to angel investments that were completed by 2007 using the most comprehensive data available.[22] Their findings for returns on group-affiliated angel investments were as follows:

- The average was 2.6 times the return on investment after 3.5 years.
- Almost  $48\%$  of the returns on exited investments provided a return that was more than the amount invested by the angel group, or equivalently,  $52\%$  resulted in a loss.
- There were returns of more than 10 times the amount invested for  $7 \%$ of the exited investments.

The above findings are the returns for individual ventures. When looking at angel investor portfolios, they find that only  $39\%$  of the portfolios realized a loss (in contrast to  $52\%$  of individual investments). Overall findings appear to be comparable to those of venture capitalists that we describe later in this chapter.

Instead of studying actual returns on angel investments, in a study sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, DeGennaro and Dwyer investigate the expected returns that drive investments.[23] For their sample of 588 angel investments during 1972–2007, which contains 419 investments that were completed by the end of 2007 (i.e., exited investments),[24] they found that angel investors can expect to earn net returns of  $70\%$  in excess of the risk-free rate of return available in the market for an average holding period of 3.67 years. This is roughly the same profile that has been found for venture capitalists.[25]

# Equity Crowdfunding Platforms

Crowdfunding is the practice of raising funds for a startup from a large number of investors who invest small sums. Typically, the funds are raised via the Internet. There are two types of crowdfunding: reward (donation) crowdfunding and equity crowdfunding.[26] Our focus here is on equity crowdfunding, which allows investors to obtain an equity interest in a startup company.

Any startup that is interested in raising equity capital has to comply with its home country's securities regulations. In the United States, for example, startup companies must comply with the general solicitation and advertising as set forth by the SEC. Prior to April 5, 2012, equity crowdfunding was not allowed in the United States. However, provisions in the Jumpstart Our Business Starts Act (JOBS Act) made possible the soliciting of funds by startups, allowing for equity crowdfunding. Since that time, numerous equity crowdfunding platforms have been started.

# Seed Accelerators

Seed accelerators provide a vehicle for founders to launch a company in a high-tech industry. They do so by providing seed stage financing in exchange for a small equity stake in the startup. The amount of funding available from accelerators ranges from  $20,000 to$ 100,000 in exchange for 2–10\% equity in the company. Funding is in the form of a convertible note, the same instrument used by angel investors and described later in this chapter.

What is key for founders who are considering seed accelerators is the opportunity to gain access not only to needed funding but also to other potential investors, training in a short period of time, temporary office space, and access to a team of experts. By providing mentoring for founders, seed accelerators prepare founders to present their ideas for a product or service to potential venture capitalists. At the conclusion of the program (i.e., on graduation from the program), there is a "demo day," where founders can make presentations to potential investors and the press.

# Expansion Financing

Until about 2010, the primary sources for expansion financing have been traditional venture capital firms, corporate venture capital firms, and online venture capital funds. The most recent entrants providing financing for startup companies in the very late stages are institutional investors, such as mutual funds and closed-end investment companies.

# Venture Capitalists

According to the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), venture capital firms are "professional, institutional managers of risk capital that enables and supports the most innovative and promising companies."27 The funds invested in a startup business are in the form of equity. The investments are typically made in a series or in rounds that typically occur every two years, based on predetermined milestones being reached by the startup company. The equity investments are typically highly illiquid and have little value until the company matures, which is expected to take from five to eight years after the company is launched.

Because venture capital firms typically take equity positions in private companies, how do they differ from private equity firms that invest in private companies? Venture capital firms are often said to be a special type of private equity firm that invests in startup companies.[28] In contrast, the typical private equity firm invests in mature companies that are seeking to go private or are considered to be underperforming and have the potential for highly attractive returns. One important difference in how returns are generated between the investments made by venture capital firms and private equity firms is the use of leverage by the latter.

In 2015, capital venture investments were approximately  $59.1 billion, used to finance the following stages as categorized by the NVCA: seeding stage, 2\%$ ; early stage,  $34\%$ ; late stage,  $27\%$ , and expansion stage,  $37\%$ . Of the 59.1 billion, $42.1 was invested in 2,620 information technology companies, $10.9 billion in 664 medical/health/life science companies, and the balance, 6.1 billion, in 420 non-high-tech companies. Of the nine industry sectors in which investments were made by venture capital firms in 2015, half were to just two industry sectors: the software sector (40\%) and biotechnology sector (13\%).[29]

According to the NVCA, usually only  $10\%$  of the business plans submitted to a venture capital firm for funding are given serious consideration, and only  $1\%$  of the submitted business plans are eventually funded.

Because of the long-term investment in a startup company, the partners of a venture capital firm actively engage in various aspects of the company in which they invest. At a minimum, this takes the form of participation in corporate governance by obtaining one or more seats on the board of directors.

The process for creating a portfolio of ventures by a venture capital firm is as follows. This portfolio of ventures is referred to as the "VC fund." Typically, a limited partnership is formed by the venture capital firm. A limited partnership has general partners and limited partners. The former manage the investment portfolio of ventures and have unlimited liability, whereas the latter do not participate in the selection of ventures to include in the investment portfolio and have limited liability. For a VC fund, the venture capital firm is the general partner, and the limited partners are the outside investors from whom the venture capital firm obtains commitments to invest in the fund. Thus, an investor does not invest in the capital venture firm or an individual venture but rather in a particular VC fund (i.e., portfolio of ventures).

The investors in the VC funds created by venture capital firms are institutional investors, family offices, and high net worth individuals. Institutional investors include pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, and foundations. Family offices are entities that manage the financial and personal affairs of a wealthy family.

A VC fund is created when the venture capital firm obtains sufficient commitments from investors. As investors provide cash to the venture capital firm, the VC fund's general partners make the investments in ventures that are identified by the firm's analysts. Because there are multiple rounds of financing, a certain amount of reserves are set aside for those future rounds. The VC fund's return is realized when the venture either goes public via an IPO, is acquired by another company, or merges with another company.

An article published in the Harvard Business Review,[30] by Diane Mulcathy, a former venture capitalist and a director of private equity for the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation,[31] explains myths that she believes exist about venture capitalists. Her motivation for busting the six myths is "to help company founders develop a more realistic sense of the industry and what it offers." Mulcathy's six myths are:

- Myth 1: The primary source of funding for startup companies is venture capitalists.
- Myth 2: A venture capitalist takes a big risk when investing in a startup.
- Myth 3: Valuable advice and mentoring is provided by most venture capitalists.
- Myth 4: The returns generated by venture capital firms are spectacular.
- Myth 5: The larger the venture capital fund, the better.
- Myth 6: Venture capitalists are innovators.

In disputing Myth 1, Mulcathy notes that (1) venture capital funds have provided capital for less than  $1\%$  of U.S. companies and (2) in contrast to angel investors, whose numbers are growing, the venture capital industry is contracting. Myth 2 is clear: it is the investor in VC funds who takes on the risks associated with investing in startups, not the venture capital firm that is the general partner of a VC fund. Not all venture capital firms commit the same amount of time to advising and mentoring a startup company (Myth 3). Thus, founders must perform due diligence when selecting a venture capital firm so that the anticipated involvement sought will be provided by the firm selected. As for Myth 4 regarding the return performance, we will discuss that below. Suffice it to say here that the empirical evidence does not support the view that VC funds have generated anything near spectacular returns. Empirical evidence also fails to support the view that the larger the VC fund, the better (Myth 5). In particular, the evidence shows that as a VC fund's size increases above 250 million, performance declines. Finally, although venture capitalists may provide funding for founders with innovative ideas that need to be commercialized, management of venture capital firms has not been innovative over the past two decades, according to Mulcathy (Myth 6). She concludes by saying that although venture capitalists will play a significant role in funding startups in the future, it will be less than in the past, because the venture capital industry is contracting as new funding sources become available.

Corporate venture capitalists are corporations that invest in startups that have the potential for providing a good strategic fit to their company's offerings. Although we have described VC funds as sources for first round financing, they are also involved in the seed phases of early stage financing.

Examples of corporate venture funds include Dell Venture, Google Ventures, Cisco Investments, Lilly Ventures, Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, Microsoft Ventures, Intel Capital, and Samsung Ventures. A benefit of obtaining funding from corporate venture capitalists is that they provide the founders with access to corporate distribution channels and infrastructure, as well as to potential strategic partners.

Corporate venture funds were an important source of startup funding during the first half of 2011, a time when traditional venture capital firms were finding it difficult to raise investment funds because of the global financial crisis. At that time, corporate venture funds provided  $11\%$  of venture capital financing.[32] According to the Corporate Venture Capital Report, in the third quarter of 2013, investments by corporate venture funds reached its highest level since 2011 with $2.1 billion spread over 140 investments. Corporate venture funds accounted for  $30\%$  of all venture capital financing. The dollar investment that is available from corporate venture funds is greater than that provided by traditional venture capital firms.

The potential benefits to the corporate venture fund's parent company are threefold.[33] First, it may help the parent company respond to technological changes faster than traditional R&D programs. Josh Lerner of the Harvard Business School cites Lilly Ventures as an example of one such corporate venture fund that helped its parent company, the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, to "catch up with the rapid advances in bioscience that were threatening to render their chemistry-based expertise irrelevant."[34] Second, potentially attractive financial returns can be realized. Finally, a corporate venture fund has the potential to provide a boost to the parent company's product or services as a result of technological spillover.

Empirical evidence reported by Hyunsung Daniel Kang and Vikram Nanda based on an analysis of technological and financial returns generated by investments by 796 corporate venture funds in the bio-pharmaceutical industry between 1985 and 2006 support this third benefit. They find that the technological advances attributable to investments made by corporate venture funds did increase the parent corporation's value. However, in contrast to the positive spillover effect generated by technology on corporate value, they found that financial returns had a negligible effect.[35]

Online Venture Capital Funds

In May 2012, a platform was launched by FundersClub that allows accredited investors to become equity holders in startup ventures by selecting ventures online.[36] At the time of launch, FundersClub had 5,000 members (i.e., accredited investors). It offers two types of funds to its members: single-company funds and multiccompany funds that are managed by FundersClub. For a single-company fund, the member selects from a prescreened list of startup companies whose investment profile is provided. In contrast, for a multiccompany funds, an investor is investing in a portfolio of yet to be determined startup companies, where the companies to be selected are based on an investment strategy formulated and then executed by the FundersClub investment committee.[37]

Although at the time of launch, 500 of the 5,000 members of FundersClub invested approximately $2.5 million in nine different funds, the investment made by investors typically ranges from $2,500 to $250,000. The startup companies available to invest in, which are early, mid-, and late stage private U.S. technology companies, are prescreened by the FundersClub Investment Committee and FundersClub Panel each week. The startup companies that are screened typically are identified from FundersClub network and partners. According to FundersClub, less than  $5\%$  of the ventures vetted are selected to be listed on its website for members to review. Using a web platform, members can browse the prescreened startup companies, review their investment profiles (which include a pitch video by the founders), and sign the legal documents. Members also have the opportunity to query a startup company's founder via a moderated question and answer forum. To keep investors up to date after they invest in a startup company, as well as to potentially get them further involved, the startup company will identify on its profile the manner in which it will communicate with its investors. Several methods of communication are available, such as quarterly email updates or inclusion on an "insider investor distribution list" to inform investors of significant milestones, developments that have been achieved, and video messages from the startup company's founders.

The FundersClub platform might seem like crowdfunding as described earlier in this chapter. However, it is not crowdfunding, because investors in crowdfunding each invest a sum in one company on an individual basis. Instead, FundersClub pools the amount invested by individuals and then creates a VC fund to either invest in a single startup company or a portfolio of startup companies. Hence, this investment approach is no different than what traditional venture capitalists do when creating VC funds and can be correctly described as an "on-line VC fund." To avoid potential conflicts of interest in the selection of startups included in one of the funds, FundersClub does not charge startup companies to be included on its platform.

Institutional Investors: Mutual Funds and Hedge Funds

The latest entrants providing expansion financing for new ventures prior to an IPO, acquisition, or merger are institutional investors. These investors include mutual funds and hedge funds.

Like VC funds, these institutional investors are collective investment vehicles. Investors in these collective investment vehicles own a pro rata share of the fund's portfolio. Several of the sponsors of mutual fund families, such as BlackRock Financial Management, Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price, Janus Capital Group, and Wellington Management, have invested in startup technology companies for certain of their funds. According to CB Insight, mutual funds and hedge funds invested in 628 million in 11 startup technology companies in 2010. In the following three years, they invested in more than 31 deals.

Because investments in startup companies are referred to as "alternative investments," mutual funds that invest a significant portion of the fund's assets in startup companies are referred to as a "alternative" or "alt" mutual funds. For example, consider New Horizons Fund Inc. According to the fund's prospectus, the fund pursues an "aggressive stock fund seeking long-term capital growth primarily through investments in small, rapidly growing companies." The fund is permitted to invest in privately held companies. This fund's 2013 annual report indicated that early-stage companies accounted for about a third of the portfolio's holdings. An example of this fund's holdings in a startup company is its 2009 investment in Twitter.

An example of mutual fund participation in a startup company is Apptio. Founded in 2007, Apptio develops on-demand, cloud-based business software applications. The company's Series A financing of  $7 million was obtained in the summer of 2007 from two venture capital firms and an angel investor. Following two additional rounds of financing, by May 2012, Apptio's existing investors included four venture capital firms. In May 2012, Apptio obtained its fourth round of financing (Series D financing) of$ 50 million from not only its existing venture capital firms but also from T. Rowe Price, which acquired shares for several of the mutual funds it sponsors. One year later in May 2013, Apptio investors added to its existing investors another mutual fund, Janus Capital, as well as another unnamed institutional investor, in a 45 million Series E round financing.

Late-stage expansion financing rounds prior to an IPO typically have not involved the megadeals or rounds that are now possible from institutional investors, involving amounts that can run into hundreds of millions of dollars. The advantage to the founding teams of a high-tech startup companies is that they can postpone going public (i.e., IPOs), so that they can come to the public market with a better track record regarding growth and brand name. The motivation for these institutional investors is to get in on pre-IPO valuation. For example, in the first quarter of 2014, Airbnb Inc. was said to have raised about 450 million when institutional investors participated. To put this amount in perspective, with the exception of the Twitter IPO, no technology startup company has raised more than that amount when it went public.

As the need for financing increases as the company grows, the founders turn to the general public to meet their needs. Public funding is obtained via an IPO. It has long been viewed that an IPO is the holy grail of exit strategies. But not all founders have as their exit plan strategy an IPO. For some founders, an IPO is a necessary evil to obtain adequate funding that was unavailable from traditional sources (which include angel and venture capital financing). However, as explained above, new players in the market—institutional investors—have made the need to rush to an IPO unnecessary for some firms. Institutional investors could provide a large injection of funds to allow founders to expand without the need of public funding and, as a result, some companies have delayed going public by several years.

The decision to go public begins with discussions with the company's financial advisor to determine whether the company is a suitable candidate to go public and whether market conditions are right for an IPO. Financial advisors know what investors will consider when acquiring the shares in an IPO. For example, in some industries, a company may be able to go public only by exhibiting a long history of strong financial performance, including revenue and earnings growth. (However, a short history of performance may be acceptable for going public for a companies in certain high-tech industries.) In addition, the founders must determine the trading location for their shares (i.e., an exchange or OTC market). In the case of a company whose stock is listed on an exchange, there are listing requirements that the exchange specifies. With respect to timing, market conditions may be such that IPOs coming to market face low a stock valuation. Such unfavorable conditions would encourage a postponement of an IPO until market conditions improve.

Advantages of going public There are two principal advantages of a company going public. First, publicly traded common stock provides liquidity for the shares owned by founders as well as investors and employees who are shareholders. For some founders who desire to harvest or cash out on the value that they created by building the company, an IPO is allows them to do so.

Second, founders can use shares as a form of currency, allowing them to make acquisitions needed to expand their business as well as to attract key executives by offering stock options. The shares are a form of currency because they have a market price, making it unnecessary in transactions involving an acquisition or the hiring of a key officer to negotiate the value of the shares that are used in an exchange. Management of targeted companies that founders seek to acquire and key officers the founders seek to attract have a clearly defined idea of what is being offered by looking at the market value of the shares.

Two other alleged advantages are cited for going public. The first is that publicly traded companies have greater access to alternative financing sources, such as bank loans and bond financing. The second is that a publicly traded company is viewed as more prestigious than a private company, providing greater exposure of its offerings to the public and suppliers, as well as greater exposure to the public investing community.

Disadvantages of going public Some factors make going public less appealing to founders. First, a publicly traded company must comply with the regulatory requirements for reporting companies. For example, in the United States, SEC regulatory requirements result in the occurrence of ongoing costs beyond the initial costs (legal, accounting, and banker fees) associated with an IPO, as well as listing fees charged by an exchange if that is the trading venue selected. The costs of being a public company have increased in the United States as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Second, there are implicit costs that involve the time spent by founders preparing the information that a reporting company must provide on a periodic basis to public investors.

Another concern is the potential loss of confidentiality, a third disadvantage for some companies of taking a private company public. In the United States, a reporting company in its prospectus in its IPO and in its Form 10-K is required to disclose information that founders might view as highly sensitive to its operations or business strategy. The information that is not required from private companies but is from public ones includes information about products, customers, R&D, and management strategies.

The potential loss of control and flexibility when making business decisions as a result of going public is a fourth disadvantage of going public. When the founders lose controlling interest, major decisions (and even minor ones) may necessitate shareholder approval that require costly proxy voting as well as a considerable time delay while approval is sought from shareholders. The board of directors may no longer be controlled by the founders but by major shareholder groups if more than a majority of the shares are sold to the public. Of course, common stock with limited voting rights can be sold, but this may make the common stock less appealing to investors, resulting in a lower share valuation. Moreover, not all founders will be in a position to issue shares with limited voting rights.

Finally, founders who remain with the company after the IPO will experience pressure to perform as expected by shareholders and the financial community to achieve targeted financial metrics, such as earnings per share and earnings growth per share. This often results in the shifting of focus of founders from building a stronger company to achieving short-term financial targets at the expense of long-term performance.

# Equity Dilutive Securities Used for New Ventures

The financial instruments that can be issued to raise funds are classified as either equity or debt. For most publicly traded nonfinancial corporations, equity is the larger component of the capital structure. For startup companies, equity (or equity-type debt) is typically an even larger component of the capital structure—particularly in the early stages of financing—than it is for publicly traded nonfinancial corporations. This decision about its capital structure (i.e., how much should be financed by equity versus debt) is typically forced on the founders because of the limited sources of pure debt financing available. By "pure debt" financing refers to debt where the creditors are not entitled to convert the debt for equity. As a startup enters into its later stages, there are opportunities to issue pure debt.

Here we review the issuance of securities in the United States by new ventures that lead to the issuance of common stock, referred to as equity dilutive securities. These securities include convertible preferred stock and convertible debt. Most investors in a startup company prefer equity dilutive securities to common stock for the reasons described in this chapter.

When common stock shares or equity dilutive securities are issued to obtain financing, the founders are concerned about the impact on ownership and control of the company. With respect to ownership, founders will look at how their ownership percentage changes following a round of financing. Control means the flexibility afforded the founders when managing the company in terms of strategic planning and directing the future of the company.

Many startup companies have been moving away from the "one share, one vote" common structure and toward a dual-class stock structure, where each class of stock has different voting rights. The motivation for creating different classes with different voting rights is that it allows the company's founders to retain control of the company by controlling the class of common stock with the largest number of voting rights. Typically in a dual-class structure, the two classes of common stock are referred to as "Class A stock" and "Class B stock." One cannot simply tell which class has the larger number of voting rights from the label. That is, there is no industry rule stating A or B will have the larger number of voting rights.

Historically, founding members of companies have been able to maintain control by owning less than a majority of the shares but by controlling the voting shares. For example, Rupert Murdock, CEO of News Corp., owns less than  $1\%$  of the nonvoting stock (which is traded in the market) but controls  $40\%$  of the voting stock. In 2004, Google adopted a dual-class structure—Class A and Class B common stock. Each share of Class A common stock has one vote per share, whereas Class B has 10 votes per share. The two founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, as well as the then-CEO, held the Class B shares. When Google went public, its Class A shares were sold via a Dutch auction. The dual-class structure gave the founders and CEO control over two-thirds of the voting shares. Facebook has a dual class structure with the same number of votes as Google for its Class A and Class B stock. The CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, owned shares of Class B stock that allowed the retention of control after the Class A stock was sold via its IPO in 2012.[38]

Preferred stock is a hybrid security that combines the features of common stock and a debt obligation (such as a bond). Despite its debt-like feature, it is considered a form of equity security and on the balance sheet appears as part of stockholders' equity. Unlike common stockholders, preferred stockholders typically do not have voting rights except under certain circumstances described later. In the early stages of a startup company, preferred stock that allows for such investors as angel investors and venture capitalists to convert the preferred stock into common stock is the vehicle of choice for investors who seek to benefit from the price appreciation potential for the common stock.

Preferred stock comes with provisions that convey rights, preferences, and privileges to the investors. The holders of a company's preferred stock have a claim on the dividends declared by the corporation's board of directors, and this claim is senior to that of the holders of the company's common stock. Preferred stock has a par value and a dividend rate. However, as with common stock issued by a startup company, investors in preferred stock are typically not paid a dividend due to the need to conserve cash.

We now describe the different features of preferred stock.

Dividends The par value together with the preferred stock dividend rate determines the dollar amount of the dividends that would be paid if there are sufficient earnings to pay preferred stockholders. For example, suppose that a company's preferred stock has a par value of 100 per share and a dividend rate of 6\%. Multiplying the par value of 100 by the 6\% dividend rate gives the annual dividend amount (6 in our example) that the company agrees to pay its preferred stockholders.

A company is under no legal obligation to pay preferred stockholders any dividends. However, in such instances, there is typically a provision that imposes restrictions on management when dividends have not been paid. One such provision conveys preferred stockholders voting rights to elect some members to the issuer's board of directors. This feature is called "contingent voting rights," because the voting rights are contingent on a missed dividend payment. Despite this adverse impact, the legal consequences for failing to make a preferred stock dividend payment are not as dire as when a company fails to pay creditors the interest payment due to them. In that case, the company is legally obligated to repay the principal immediately (i.e., pay off the debt obligation), and failure to do so may result in bankruptcy.

If there is a shortfall in the quarterly dividend payment to preferred stockholders, is the company required to make up the shortfall in future quarters? The answer depends on how this situation is provided for in the preferred stock agreement. Preferred stock can be either cumulative or noncumulative preferred stock. For cumulative preferred stock, the dividend payment accrues until it is fully paid, and therefore common stockholders cannot receive any dividends until that is done. In the case of noncumulative preferred stock, any shortfall in a quarterly dividend payment is lost. As noted earlier, dividends are typically not paid by startups. Consequently, preferred stock issued by a startup company typically will be cumulative preferred stock, where the unpaid dividends will be added to the preferred stock's par value.

Liquidation preferences During a liquidating event, the par value is the amount that the holder is entitled to receive before common stockholders can receive any amount of the liquidation proceeds. Typically, a liquidating event is defined broadly in the agreement. It is not limited to the actual liquidation of the company as a result of bankruptcy or dissolution. Instead, it will typically include the sale of the company and a change of control. In practice, startups often will not have much in proceeds if there is a liquidation event that results in the bankruptcy of the company.

The preference granted to preferred stockholders in the case of a liquidating event is considered to be this type of security's key provision, as well as impacting subsequent rounds of financing. To illustrate the importance of the preference granted, let's consider the case of a liquidating event where a company is sold for  $22 million (after all costs associated with the sale) and assume the following for the pre-sale capital structure: par value of preferred stock of$ 5 million and debt of 2 million. Once creditors are paid their $2 million, the amount available to all equity investors (preferred stockholders and common stockholders) is $20 million. Now the question is how the $20 million is allocated between the preferred stockholders and common stockholders. If the preferred stockholders are not permitted to participate in any proceeds above the amount of their par value when there is a liquidation event, then the preferred stock is said to be "nonparticipating preferred stock" (or "1× liquidation preference"). In our illustration, the distribution of proceeds resulting from the sale would be as follows: $5 million to preferred stockholders and 15 million to common stockholders.

Founders seek to negotiate terms such that the preferred stock is nonparticipating. In contrast, preferred stockholders in new ventures will seek to participate in the liquidation proceeds beyond the par value of the preferred stock. If preferred stockholders are entitled to share along with common stockholders any remaining liquidation proceeds, then the preferred stock is said to be "participating preferred stock." Preferred stock that conveys a participating right can have different forms of participation, defined in terms of a multiple of the preferred stock's par value. For example, if preferred stockholders are entitled to receive twice or triple their par value (referred to as "2× liquidation preference" and "3× liquidation preference," respectively), then the distribution would be as follows:

Distribution to

$2 \times$  liquidation preference

$3 \times$  liquidation preference

Preferred stockholders:

\$10 million

\$15 million

Common stockholders:

\$10 million

\$5 million

A hybrid of the two types of preferred stock just described is one in which participation takes place, but it is capped at a specified amount. This form of preferred stock is referred to as capped participating preferred stock or partially participating preferred stock. For example, in our previous illustration, suppose that the preferred stockholders are entitled to share equally in liquidation proceeds up to $8 million. Then the preferred stockholders would receive $8 million, and the common stockholders would receive the balance of 12 million.

Conversion provision The optional conversion feature in a preferred stock offering often granted to investors in a startup company typically grants the investor the right to convert to the company's common shares. Restrictions may be imposed on when the conversion must occur. Typically, conversion is mandatory if certain events occur, such as an IPO. There are provisions to protect investors against dilution of their potential equity position.

# Convertible Note

A convertible note is typically issued to investors in the early stages of financing of a startup prior to a first ("Series A") round of financing. Unlike convertible preferred stock, which is a form of equity, a convertible note is a form of debt. The holder of the convertible note either has the option to exchange the note for an equity position or automatically has the position converted into an equity position if there is a Series A round of financing. The equity position received by the holder of a convertible note is typically preferred stock.

Conversion terms Let's first look at a traditional convertible note issued by a mature corporation. The traditional convertible note gives the investor the right to convert into the issuer's common stock. The number of common stock shares into which the convertible note can be converted is called the "conversion ratio." Typically, the conversion ratio is fixed over the life of the convertible note. If the par value of the convertible note is  $1,000 and the conversion ratio is 20:1, then the investor is entitled to convert the note into 20 shares of common stock. Effectively the price that the investor would be paying for each share of common stock by exercising the conversion privilege (i.e., the "conversion price") is$ 50 per share.

When used for seed financing by a startup, the conversion note differs in two ways. First, the conversion is typically into preferred stock and not common stock as in the case of a traditional convertible note. Moreover, the preferred stock is convertible preferred stock. So the exercise of the conversion privilege gives the investor the right to convert into a security that, in turn, has the right to eventually convert into common stock. Because a convertible debt can ultimately result in the issuance of more common stock, it is a form of an equity dilutive security.

The second difference is the price paid for the preferred stock when conversion occurs. The price that an investor will have to pay for the preferred stock shares if conversion occurs is based on a provision set forth in the convertible note offering. There could be a conversion discount or a conversion valuation cap. As explained below, both these provisions are included for the benefit of convertible note investors to compensate them for the substantial risks that they accepted by being early investors.

Conversion discount Early investors in a startup who purchase the convertible note do so in anticipation of generating an attractive return, if the startup performs well and its common stock price increases. Consequently, there must be provisions in the convertible note offering that allow investors to be compensated for accepting this risk exposure at the early stages of the startup. In addition, that reward should be potentially greater than that given to investors who invest in later financing rounds of the startup. In other words, when later investors (such as venture capitalists) make a determination of the value of the startup to purchase the shares of the preferred stock, investors in the convertible note want to be able to purchase the preferred shares at a lower price, because they were the initial bearers of the high risks associated with a startup company.

The provision that allows convertible note investors to do just that is the conversion discount, which specifies the discount at which convertible note investors can buy the preferred stock shares below what Series A investors pay for their preferred stock shares. Here is an example of how it works, assuming a  $25\%$  conversion discount.

Suppose that the convertible note funding is 300,000 with an interest rate of 10\%. Two years later, there is a Series A financing by a venture capital fund, where the terms obtained are such that preferred stock could be purchased for $1 per share. The 25\% conversion discount means that the convertible note investors would pay $0.75 per share of preferred stock (this is what we referred to earlier as the conversion price). How many shares of preferred stock would the convertible note investors receive? Because the convertible note investor is entitled to convert both the par value ($300,000) plus the accrued interest ($60,000), the amount converted is based on $360,000. Because the convertible note's amount to be converted is $360,000 and each preferred share can be purchased for $0.75 per share, the number of preferred shares would be 480,000 shares ($360,000/0.75).

The conversion discount need not be fixed over the life of the security. Instead it can be structured so that it increases over time until Series A financing is obtained. One might expect that the longer it takes to obtain Series A financing, the greater will be the risk exposure of the convertible note investor and therefore a higher conversion discount is warranted. This is also an incentive for the founders to seek Series A financing as soon as reasonably possible to avoid further dilution.

A startup company may not necessarily raise all funds via convertible notes at one time. There may be several issues of convertible notes offered at different times. The conversion discount can be different for each offering, depending on what is needed to attract investors at the time of each offering. For example, a conversion discount may be higher for very early investors interested in purchasing convertible notes than for later investors in convertible notes.

Unlike a traditional convertible note, where the investors benefit from a rise in the value of the company, although investors in a startup's convertible note also benefit from an increase in valuation, investors do not want to see it rise that much by the Series A round of financing. The higher the valuation placed by the Series A investors is, the fewer shares of preferred stock will be received.

Conversion valuation cap A conversion valuation cap is the maximum dollar amount that can be used for determining the conversion price that the holder of the convertible note has to pay for the right to convert into preferred stock. The reason that this provision benefits the investor is that a lower price can be paid for the preferred stock than Series A investors pay.

To illustrate, suppose that an investor owns $300,000 par value of a convertible note with a conversion valuation cap of $6 million, and the company is raising funds in a Series A financing. Suppose further that the pre-money valuation (recall that this is the valuation before angel financing) is $8 million in this financing for preferred stock with a par value of $1. At the time of financing, assume that the accrued interest for the convertible note is $60,000. The conversion valuation cap of $6 million means that the conversion price for the convertible noteholders to purchase the preferred stock is adjusted below that paid by the Series A investors. The procedure to obtain the adjustment is found by dividing the conversion valuation cap ($6 million in our example) by the pre-money valuation ($8 million in our illustration). In our illustration, the adjustment is then 75\%. Thus the convertible note investors will pay 75\% of what is paid by the Series A investors to buy the preferred stock. Because Series A investors pay $1 per share of preferred stock, the convertible note investors pay only $0.75. And so because the convertible note investors are converting $360,000 (principal plus accrued interest), they will receive 480,000 prefer stock shares ($360,000/0.75).

# Debt with Warrants

Another form of debt that is an equity dilutive security is debt with warrants to purchase the company's common stock. A warrant is a form of option that grants the warrant holder the right to exercise it and receive a specified security. Often this type of financing is raised in the later stages of a company to obtain financing between rounds of financing (i.e., bridge financing).

For example, a company might issue convertible debt with warrants to purchase up to 15\% of the common stock. This is referred to as "convertible debt with 15\% warrant coverage." Suppose that the par value of this convertible debt is $5 million. Then investors in this convertible debt with warrants have the right to purchase $750,000 (0.15 × 5 million) of the issuer's common stock. The exercise price for the warrants is determined by what investors in the next round of financing agree to pay for the common stock. Thus, what is important is that investors are confident that there will be another round of financing to determine the conversion price. This is why such financing is used less often in the very early stages of financing but occurs later on in bridge financing, when the company has already gone through several rounds of financing. However, some observrs have suggested tweaks in the convertible debt with warrant structure to increase its use in certain early stage financing situations.

# Key Points
- Every country has its own definition of what a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) is.
- The governments of different countries and international organizations establish their own guidelines for defining SMEs.
- The metrics used in classifying an enterprise as an SME include the number of employees, level of sales (revenue), and total assets.
- Governments provide various programs and initiatives to increase the funding available to qualified SMEs.
- Early-stage financing includes the seed round and the first round.
- In the seed round, sometimes referred to as the "pre-commercialization financing stage," the founders seek to finance the development of a product or service.
- In very early stage financing, typically the major source of funding is the personal assets of the founders. Such financing is referred to as "bootstrap financing."
- In first round financing (or Series A round financing), the milestone that has been reached is the generation of revenue, even though neither break-even operations nor profits are typically reached at this stage.
- It is typically difficult for founders to obtain bank financing in the seed stage (except when the founders have sufficient collateral or assets to provide personal guarantees), but once first round financing is obtained, specialty banks and nonbank entities are willing to provide venture debt that contains an equity kicker for the lender in the form of warrants.
- Sources for seed-round financing are credit cards, vendors, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, angel investors and angel groups, super angels, seed accelerators, incubators, and crowdfunding platforms, with the most common source of larger amounts of seed financing being angel investors.
- The types of government-supported funding programs that have been used by countries make financing more accessible to SMEs and new ventures are loan guarantees, direct credit loans, loan subsidies, grant programs, and preferable tax treatment for lenders to SMEs.
- Expansion-stage financing is undertaken to expand the company's business by increasing production and acquiring customers through marketing.
- Expansion-stage financing includes bridge loans, second-round financing (Series B round financing), third-round financing (also called "Series C round financing"), and so on.
- Additional rounds of financing may be necessary if the company does not have a liquidating event after several rounds of financing. The entry of a new investor group—institutional investors—has allowed ventures to raise funds through an IPO by providing substantial funds for a company to expand without the need to go public.
- The primary source of early-stage funding is angel investors, wealthy individuals who typically invest between  $150,000 and$ 2 million and who qualify under the SEC's definition of "accredited investors."
- In addition to providing funding, angel investors provide strategic planning advice, assist in team building, and provide contacts for developing key partnerships and further fundraising. Angel investors typically invest through groups or networks.
- Although venture capitalists invest primarily in first round financing, venture capital firms that do provide seed financing are referred to as "super angels" and are set up as private equity firms.
- Crowdfunding is the practice of raising funds for a startup from a large number of investors who invest small sums, typically over the Internet. Equity crowdfunding, one form of crowdfunding, allows investors to obtain an equity interest in a startup company.
- Seed accelerators offer the opportunity for founders to gain access not only to early stage financing in exchange for equity but also to other potential investors, training in a short period of time, temporary office space, and a team of experts.
- An incubator is another type of program that mentors entrepreneurs and other similar services as a seed accelerator.
- The primary sources for expansion financing have historically been traditional venture capital firms, corporate venture capital firms, and online VC funds.
- Venture capital firms invest in a startup business in the form of equity, with the investments typically made in series or rounds that typically occur every two years, based on predetermined milestones being achieved.
- Venture capital firms are often said to be a special type of private equity firm that invests in startup companies, in contrast to a typical private equity firm, which invests in mature companies seeking to go private or that are viewed to be underperforming and have the potential for highly attractive returns.
- Corporate venture capitalists are corporations that invest in startups that have the potential to provide a good strategic fit with their company's offerings.
- Institutional investors, such as mutual funds and hedge funds, are the latest entrants providing expansion financing for new ventures prior to an IPO, an acquisition, or a merger.
- The provision of funding in large sums for expansion by institutional investors has resulted in new ventures postponing going to the public to raise funds through an IPO or by being acquired.
- The founders of a company can turn to the general public to meet the company's needs through an IPO of its shares, whose issuance is governed by securities laws.
- The two principal advantages of an IPO are (1) publicly traded common stock provides liquidity for the shares owned by founders, as well as those owned by investors and employees who are shareholders, and (2) founders can use shares as a form of currency, allowing them to make the acquisitions necessary to expand their business and to attract key executives by offering stock options.
- The disadvantages of an IPO are that the company must comply with and incur the costs associated with SEC regulatory filing requirements, faces implicit costs in the form of the time devoted by founders to preparing the information that a reporting company must provide on a periodic basis to public investors, faces loss of confidentiality because of required disclosures, and management experiences pressure to perform as expected by shareholders and the financial community to achieve targeted financial metrics, resulting in the founders shifting their focus from building a stronger company to achieving short-term financial targets at the expense of long-term performance.
- In the United States, new ventures issue securities that lead to the issuance of common stock, referred to as to as "equity dilutive securities," because investors in startup companies prefer these securities to a direct investment in common stock.
- Equity dilutive securities include convertible preferred stock and convertible debt.
- Preferred stock is a hybrid security that combines the features of common stock and a debt obligation; unlike common stockholders, preferred stockholders typically do not have voting rights except under certain circumstances.
- In the early stages of a startup company, preferred stock that allows investors to convert preferred stock into common stock is the vehicle of choice for investors.
- Preferred stock comes with provisions that convey rights, preferences, and privileges to the investors in this security.
- The par value of preferred stock is important, because if there is a liquidating event, it typically includes the acquisition or merger of the company and the selling off of most of the company's assets.
- Nonparticipating preferred stock does not permit an investor to participate in any proceeds above the amount of their preference when a liquidation event occurs.
- Participating preferred stock allows investors to share along with common stockholders in some fashion with respect to any remaining liquidation proceeds.
- Capped participating preferred stock (partially participating preferred stock) is a form of preferred stock that allows participation but is capped at a specified amount.
- Convertible preferred stock allows the investor to convert into common stock.
- A convertible note, typically issued to investors in the early stages of financing (prior to a Series A round), is a form of debt.
- Convertible noteholders can have either the option to exchange the note for an equity position or automatically has the position converted into an equity position if there is a Series A round of financing.

From a regulatory perspective, there was some concern that under the Dodd-Frank Act, venture capital funds, hedge funds, and private equity firms would need to supply certain information to the SEC. Fortunately for venture capital firms, the SEC in 2011 provided a definition of a venture capital fund that would avoid this requirement. The SEC defined a venture capital fund as one that invests in "qualifying investments." A qualifying investment is mainly in shares of private companies. However, a capital venture fund is permitted to invest  $20\%$  in nonqualifying investments. It may not use significant leverage.
