The mortgage market in any country is a collection of markets that includes a primary (or origination) market and a secondary market where mortgages trade. A mortgage is a pledge of property to secure payment of a debt. Typically, property refers to real estate. If the property owner/borrower (the mortgagor) fails to pay the lender (the mortgagee), the lender has the right to foreclose the loan and seize the property to ensure that the mortgage is repaid. The types of real estate properties that can be mortgaged are divided into two broad categories: single-family residential properties and commercial properties. The former category includes houses, condominiums, and cooperatives. In the United States, the term of a mortgage (i.e., the number of years to maturity) ranges from 15 to 30 years. For most countries in Europe, a residential mortgage typically has a term between 15 and 40 years, but in some countries (e.g., France and Spain), it can be as long as 50 years. Japan is an extreme case: The term can be 100 years. Commercial properties are income-producing properties and multifamily properties (i.e., apartment buildings), office buildings, industrial properties (including warehouses), shopping centers, hotels, and health care facilities (e.g., senior residential care facilities).

Although our focus in this chapter is on the U.S. residential mortgage markets and the types of mortgage loans available, we do discuss the wide range of mortgage types available in other countries. We also discuss the role of government in the residential mortgage market.

# Origination of Residential Mortgage Loans

The original lender is called the mortgage originator. The principal originators of residential mortgage loans in the United States are thrifts, commercial banks, and mortgage bankers.

Mortgage originators may generate income from mortgage activity in one or more ways. First, they typically charge an origination fee. This fee is expressed in terms of points, where each point represents  $1\%$  of the borrowed funds. For example, an origination fee of two points on a \ $200,000 mortgage is \$ 4,000. Originators also may charge application fees and certain processing fees. The second source of revenue is the profit that might be generated from selling a mortgage at a higher price than it originally cost. This profit is called secondary market profit. If mortgage rates rise, an originator will realize a loss when the mortgages are sold in the secondary market.

Although technically, the sources of revenue attributable to the origination function are origination fees and secondary marketing profits, there are two other potential sources. First, mortgage originators may service the mortgages they originate, for which they obtain a servicing fee. Servicing of the mortgage involves collecting monthly payments from mortgagors and forwarding proceeds to owners of the loan, sending payment notices to mortgagors, reminding mortgagors when payments are overdue, maintaining records of mortgage balances, furnishing tax information to mortgagors, administering an escrow account for real estate taxes and insurance purposes, and (if necessary) initiating foreclosure proceedings. The servicing fee is a fixed percentage of the outstanding mortgage balance, typically 25 basis points to 100 basis points per year. The mortgage originator may sell the servicing of the mortgage to another party, who would then receive the servicing fee. Second, the mortgage originator may hold the mortgage in its investment portfolio.

Mortgage banking refers to the activity of originating mortgages. Banks and thrifts undertake mortgage banking. However, there are companies not associated with a bank or thrift that are involved in mortgage banking. These mortgage bankers, unlike banks and thrifts, typically do not invest in the mortgages they originate. Instead, they derive their income from the origination fees. Commercial banks derive their income from all three sources.

# The Mortgage Origination Process

Someone who wants to borrow funds to purchase a home will apply for a loan from a mortgage originator. The potential homeowner completes an application form, which provides financial information about the applicant, and pays an application fee; then the mortgage originator performs a credit evaluation of the applicant. The requirements specified by the originator to grant the loan are referred to as underwriting standards.

The two primary quantitative underwriting standards are (1) the payment-to-income ratio (PTI) and (2) the loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The first is the ratio of monthly payments to monthly income, which measures the ability of the applicant to make monthly payments (both mortgage and real estate tax payments). The lower this ratio is, the greater the likelihood that the applicant will be able to meet the required payments.

The difference between the purchase price of the property and the amount borrowed is the borrower's down payment. The LTV is the ratio of the amount of the loan to the market (or appraised) value of the property. The lower this ratio is, the greater the protection for the lender if the applicant defaults on the payments and the lender must repossess and resell the property. For example, if an applicant wants to borrow $225,000 on a property with an appraised value of $300,000, the LTV is 75\%. Suppose the applicant subsequently defaults on the mortgage. The lender can then repossess the property and sell it to recover the amount owed. But the amount that will be received by the lender depends on the market value of the property. In our example, even if conditions in the housing market are weak, the lender will still be able to recover the proceeds lent if the value of the property declines by $75,000. Suppose instead that the applicant wanted to borrow $270,000 for the same property. The LTV would then be 90\%. If the lender had to foreclose on the property and then sell it because the applicant defaulted, there is less protection for the lender.

If the lender decides to lend the funds, it sends a commitment letter to the applicant. This letter commits the lender to provide funds to the applicant. The length of time of the commitment varies between 30 and 60 days. At the time of the commitment letter, the lender will require that the applicant pay a commitment fee. It is important to understand that the commitment letter obligates the lender—not the applicant—to perform. The commitment fee that the applicant pays is lost if the applicant decides not to purchase the property or uses an alternative source of funds to purchase the property. Thus, the commitment letter states that, for a fee, the applicant has the right but not the obligation to require the lender to provide funds at a certain interest rate and on certain terms. The lender has effectively granted the applicant an option to borrow the funds, with the commitment fee paid by the applicant being the option price.

Mortgage originators can either (1) hold the mortgage in their portfolios, (2) sell the mortgage to an investor that wishes to hold the mortgage in its portfolio, (3) place the mortgage in a pool of mortgages to be used as collateral for the issuance of a security, or (4) sell the mortgage to another party that will place the mortgage in a pool of mortgages to be used as collateral for a security. When a mortgage is used as collateral for the issuance of a security, the mortgage is said to be a securitized mortgage. We discuss the securitization of residential mortgages in chapter 30. An entity that purchases mortgages from mortgage originators for the purpose of using them as collateral in a securitization is said to be a mortgage conduit.

The loan applications being processed and the commitments made by a mortgage originator together are referred to as its pipeline. Pipeline risk refers to the risks associated with originating mortgages. This risk has two components: price risk and fallout risk.

Price risk refers to the adverse effects on the value of the pipeline if mortgage rates in the market rise. If mortgage rates rise, and if the mortgage originator has made commitments at a lower mortgage rate, it will either have to sell the mortgages when they close at a value below the funds lent to homeowners or retain the mortgages as a portfolio investment earning a below-market mortgage rate. The mortgage originator faces the same risk for mortgage applications in the pipeline on which the applicants have elected to fix the rate at the time the applications were submitted.

Fallout risk is the risk that applicants or those who were issued commitment letters will not close (i.e., complete the transaction by purchasing the property with funds borrowed from the mortgage originator). A major reason potential borrowers may cancel their commitments or withdraw their mortgage applications is that mortgage rates decline sufficiently that it is economic to seek an alternative lender. Fallout risk is the result of the mortgage originator giving the potential borrower the right but not the obligation to close (i.e., the right to cancel the agreement). Reasons other than a decline in mortgage rates may also cause a potential borrower to fall out of the pipeline. The property inspection report may be unfavorable, or the purchase could have been predicated on a change in employment that does not occur.

Mortgage originators have several alternatives to protect themselves against pipeline risk. To protect against price risk, the originator could get a commitment from the entity to whom the mortgage originator plans to sell the mortgage. This sort of commitment is effectively a forward contract, a contract we will discuss in chapter 33. The mortgage originator agrees to deliver a mortgage at a future date, and another party (such as a conduit) agrees to buy the mortgage at that time at a predetermined price (or mortgage rate).

Consider what happens, however, if mortgage rates decline and potential borrowers elect to cancel the agreement. The mortgage originator has agreed to deliver a mortgage with a specified mortgage rate. If the potential borrower does not close and the mortgage originator has made a commitment to deliver the mortgage to a conduit, the mortgage originator cannot back out of the transaction. As a result, the mortgage originator will realize a loss—it must deliver a mortgage at a higher mortgage rate in a lower-mortgage-rate environment. This is fallout risk.

Mortgage originators can protect themselves against fallout risk by entering into an agreement with a conduit for optional rather than mandatory delivery of the mortgage. In such an agreement, the mortgage originator is effectively buying an option that gives it the right, but not the obligation, to deliver a mortgage. (Recall that when the originator issued the commitment letter, it gave the applicant such an option.) The conduit has sold that option to the mortgage originator and therefore charges a fee for allowing optional delivery.

# Mortgage Servicers

Every mortgage loan must be serviced. As explained earlier, servicing a mortgage involves collecting monthly payments and forwarding proceeds to owners of the loan, sending payment notices to mortgagors, reminding mortgagors when payments are overdue, maintaining records of principal balances, administering an escrow balance for real estate taxes and insurance purposes, initiating foreclosure proceedings if necessary, and furnishing tax information to mortgagors when applicable.

Mortgage servicers include bank-related entities, thrift-related entities, and mortgage bankers. Four sources of revenue arise from mortgage servicing. The primary source is the servicing fee. This fee is a fixed percentage of the outstanding mortgage balance. Consequently, the revenue from servicing declines over time as the mortgage balance declines over time if the borrower is required to make monthly payments to reduce the mortgage balance. The second source of servicing income arises from the interest that can be earned by the servicer from the escrow balance that a borrower often maintains with a servicer. The third source of revenue is the float earned on the monthly mortgage payment. This opportunity arises because of the delay permitted between the time the servicer receives the payment and the time that the payment must be sent to the investor. Fourth, there are several sources of ancillary income: (1) a late fee collected by the servicer if the mortgage payment is not made on time, (2) commissions from cross-selling the borrowers' insurance products, and (3) fees generated from selling mailing lists.

# Types of Residential Mortgage Loans

There are different types of residential mortgages available in countries that have a mortgage market. They can be classified according to the following attributes:

- interest rate type,
- repayment structure,
- treatment of prepayments,
- lender's recourse,
- lien status, credit classification,
credit guarantees, and
- conforming versus nonconforming status.

# Interest Rate Type

The interest rate on a mortgage is referred to as the mortgage rate or note rate. Based on interest rate type, mortgages can be classified as follows:

- fixed-rate mortgage,
- indexed adjustable-rate mortgage,
- reviewable adjustable-rate mortgage,
- rollover (renegotiable) mortgage,
- hybrid mortgage, or convertible mortgage.

For a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM), the mortgage is unchanged over the term of the mortgage. Mortgages of this type can be found in many countries, including the United States, France, Germany, and Denmark, and they are the most common mortgage type in the first two countries listed. In the early years of the development of the mortgage credit market in those countries, the FRM was the most common type of mortgage. The FRM was the most common type in Denmark until recently and in Italy, Spain, and Greece until the early 1990s. Today the dominant mortgage type in Europe and in most other countries is the one we describe next.

An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), also referred to as a variable-rate mortgage, is one whose rate resets periodically. The frequency at which the mortgage rate resets can be monthly, semiannually, or annually. The major risk of using an ARM from the borrower's perspective is that the mortgage rate may increase so dramatically as a result of conditions in the capital market that it may significantly impair the borrower's ability to meet the mortgage payments. To reduce this risk for borrowers, referred to as "payment shock risk," there is typically a cap on how high the mortgage rate can increase. There may be a periodic rate cap, a lifetime rate cap, or both. A periodic rate cap limits the amount that the mortgage rate may increase at the reset date. A lifetime rate cap specifies the maximum rate that may be imposed over the mortgage's life. When there is a cap, the lender is sharing the payment shock risk with the borrower. An ARM may also specify a floor below which the mortgage rate cannot be reduced, periodically or over the mortgage's term. The inclusion of a floor in the mortgage reduces the interest rate shock risk faced by the lender.

In the United States, a typical ARM agreement has both types of rate caps. In some countries, any rate cap may be set so high that it does not really reduce the borrower's payment shock risk. Spain is an example. It is not uncommon to find realistic rate caps in EU member countries, where the FRM dominates and the ARM is an alternative mortgage product offered by lenders. This is the situation in France, where the rate cap is set at 200 basis points above the initial mortgage rate.

The method for determining the new mortgage rate at a reset date determines the type of ARM, either index referenced or reviewable. For an indexed ARM, referred to as an index tracker ARM in the European Union, the mortgage rate at a reset date is set by a formula that links the mortgage rate to an interest rate index. For example, in the United States, an index-referenced ARM that resets every year might be linked to the one-year U.S. Treasury bill rate. In Korea and Spain, index-referenced ARMs dominate. $^2$  When the amount of the adjustment of the mortgage rate at a reset date is at the discretion of the lender, the mortgage is called a reviewable ARM. In Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, this is the dominant mortgage type. $^3$

As with an ARM, a rollover mortgage (or renegotiable mortgage) and a hybrid mortgage have a fixed mortgage rate that is adjusted after a specified period of time. What distinguishes a rollover mortgage from a hybrid mortgage is the type of mortgage rate after the initial specified period. If after the reset date the mortgage rate is fixed for another period, it is called a rollover mortgage. In some countries, the new fixed rate might be for the remainder of the mortgage's life. A rollover mortgage is the dominant form in Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. When the mortgage starts out at a fixed rate and then becomes an ARM after a specified initial term, the mortgage is referred to as a hybrid mortgage. For example, a hybrid mortgage might have a fixed rate for the first five years, then after five years it might convert to an indexed ARM that is adjusted every year.

Finally, a convertible mortgage starts out with a mortgage rate that for a specified period of time can be either fixed or adjustable. The borrower has the option to convert the mortgage into an FRM or an ARM for the remainder of the mortgage's term. The appeal to borrowers of this type of mortgage is that it mitigates payment shock risk. This type of mortgage is available in the United States and several other countries. Almost half of the mortgages in Japan are convertible.[5]

# Repayment Structure

The amount borrowed is referred to the "original mortgage balance." The amount that must be repaid by the end of the mortgage term and the method for doing so are referred to as the repayment structure. Typically a mortgage payment is made monthly. If any amount of the monthly mortgage payment exceeds the amount of the interest required for that amount, the excess amount is used to reduce the original mortgage balance. A lender would prefer a mortgage where some principal is repaid over the mortgage's term to reduce the credit risk it faces when lending against the property.

The repayment of the principal borrowed as part of the monthly loan payment is referred to as amortization. The mortgage can specify that each monthly payment include amortization. That is, the monthly mortgage payment can include the monthly interest based on the mortgage balance at the beginning of the month plus a scheduled principal amount that represents scheduled amortization. A mortgage that specifies a scheduled payment of principal that the borrower must make is referred to as an amortizing mortgage. An amortizing mortgage is typical in most countries.

For an amortizing mortgage, the monthly scheduled principal payments can be such that when all scheduled principal payments are added, the total is equal to the original mortgage balance. As a result, when the borrower makes the final monthly mortgage payment, the last payment is enough to cover the outstanding mortgage balance for that month. As a result, no further payments are required by the borrower. For example, suppose a mortgage has an original mortgage balance of  $200,000, a mortgage rate of 7.5\%$ , and a term of 30 years. Then the monthly mortgage payment would be 1,398.43. Notice that the monthly mortgage payment is the same over all 360 months. How this monthly mortgage payment is determined is explained in the appendix to this chapter. Assuming that the borrower has made all 360 monthly payments on a timely basis, then it can be shown (see the appendix) that after the last monthly mortgage payment is made, the outstanding mortgage balance is zero (i.e., the mortgage is paid off). This type of amortizing mortgage is referred to as a fully amortizing mortgage and is the typical mortgage in the United States.

Although our illustration is for an FRM, an ARM is also typically a fully amortizing mortgage. Because the mortgage rate changes, the monthly mortgage payment has to be recalculated at each reset date so that the new monthly mortgage payments are sufficient to fully amortize the outstanding mortgage balance at the reset date. This determination of the new monthly mortgage payment, explained in the appendix, is referred to as "recasting the mortgage." For example, let's consider once again a $200,000, 30-year mortgage. Assume that the mortgage is an ARM that adjusts annually and that the initial mortgage rate (i.e., the mortgage rate for the first 12 months) is 7.5\%. It can be shown that at the end of the 12th month, the outstanding mortgage balance would be $198,156.33. Recasting the mortgage involves computing the monthly mortgage payment that will fully amortize a mortgage of $198,156.33 for 29 years (348 months) because after one year, there are 29 years remaining on the loan. The interest rate used to recast the mortgage is the new mortgage rate at the reset date. Suppose that the reset rate is 8.5\%. Then the monthly mortgage payment to fully amortize the mortgage can be shown to be $1,535.26, and that is therefore the monthly mortgage payment for the next 12 months.

An amortizing mortgage can be such that the total of the monthly scheduled principal payments is less than the original mortgage balance. For such amortizing mortgages, referred to as partial amortizing mortgages, the amount owed at the end of the mortgage's term is the difference between the original mortgage balance and the total of the scheduled principal payment and any unscheduled principal payment that might have been made. This amount, which must be paid by the borrower to the lender, is referred to as a balloon payment.

In countries such as Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Korea, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and to a limited extent the United States, mortgages are available that require no monthly scheduled principal payments for a specified period of time. Instead, only the monthly interest is paid for that period, and therefore there is no amortization of the original mortgage balance. This type of mortgage is referred to an interest-only mortgage. The period of time during which there is no scheduled principal payment is called the lockout period. After the lockout period, the monthly mortgage changes so that the monthly mortgage payments include a scheduled principal amount that is sufficient to fully amortize the original amount of the loan over the remaining term of the loan. A special type of interest-only mortgage is one with no scheduled principal payments over the life of the mortgage. This type of mortgage, referred to as an interest-only life mortgage or a bullet mortgage, is available in Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. This type of mortgage obviously exposes lenders to greater credit risk than an amortizing mortgage.

# Treatment of Prepayments

Borrowers often want the right to repay all or part of their mortgage balance before the scheduled maturity date. This may be desirable for many reasons, but a key reason is that if market interest rates decline and the borrower has the opportunity to refinance at a lower mortgage rate, the economic value of refinancing can be considerable, even after taking into account the costs associated with obtaining a new mortgage.

The amount of the payment made in excess of the monthly mortgage payment is called a prepayment. As an example, consider once again the 30-year,  $200,000 mortgage with a 7.5\%$  mortgage rate. The monthly mortgage payment is 1,398.43. Suppose the borrower makes a payment of $5,398.43. This payment exceeds the monthly mortgage payment by $4,000. This amount represents a prepayment and reduces the outstanding mortgage balance by 4,000. This type of prepayment, in which the entire mortgage balance is not paid off, is called a partial prepayment or curtailment. When a curtailment is made, the mortgage is not recast (i.e., the monthly mortgage payment is not changed). Instead, the borrower continues to make the same monthly mortgage payment. The effect of the prepayment is that more of the subsequent monthly mortgage payment is applied to reduce the outstanding mortgage balance. The more common type of prepayment is one in which the entire outstanding mortgage balance is paid off before the mortgage's contractual maturity.

Effectively, the borrower's right to prepay a mortgage in whole or in part without a penalty is a call option. The mortgage that mitigates the borrower's right to prepay is a prepayment penalty mortgage. This type of mortgage imposes penalties if the borrower prepays. The penalties are designed to discourage refinancing activity and require a fee to be paid if the loan is prepaid within a certain amount of time after funding.

Because the major concern for a lender is that the borrower will prepay when interest rates decline, prepayment penalties can be viewed as a form of yield maintenance provision that can be found in callable bonds and (as explained in chapter 31) commercial mortgages. Prepayment penalty mortgages that are available in the United States are typically structured to allow borrowers to partially prepay up to  $20\%$  of their loan each year the penalty is in effect, and charge the borrower six months of interest for prepayments on the remaining  $80\%$  of their balance. Some penalties are waived if the property is sold and are described as "soft" penalties; hard penalties require the penalty to be paid even if the prepayment occurs as a result of the sale of the property.

The laws and regulations governing the imposition of prepayment penalties are established not only by each country but even by jurisdictions within a country. Laws in European countries typically permit penalties for prepayment, and in fact, prepayment penalty mortgages are common in Europe. In the United States, usually the applicable laws for FRMs are specified at the state level. Some states do not allow prepayment penalties on FRMs. Other states do permit them but restrict the type of penalty. For ARMS, certain federal laws override state laws. Consequently, although the proportion of prepayment penalty mortgages is small in the United States, they do exist in states that permit the imposition of such penalties.

# Lender's Recourse

Borrowers do default. When that occurs, the lender has the right to repossess the property and then sell it. However, if the proceeds received from the sale of the property are less than the outstanding mortgage balance, what can the lender do to recover the loss? The answer depends on whether the loan is a recourse or a nonrecourse loan. If the lender is entitled to have a claim against the borrower for the shortfall, the mortgage is said to be a recourse loan. Thus, the lender can look to the borrower's other assets to try to recover through the legal system as much of the shortfall as possible. With a nonrecourse mortgage, unless there is some claim of fraud, the lender does not have a claim against the borrower. That is, the lender can only look to the property to recover the outstanding mortgage balance.

Whether the lender is entitled to recourse in the case of a default varies by country. In the United States, all mortgages to purchase a residence are nonrecourse mortgages. In European countries and Japan, mortgage lending is on a recourse basis. This is one of the reasons for the higher mortgage default rates in the United States than in European countries and Japan. It is the statutory ban on recourse lending for residential mortgage property in the United States that provides an incentive for borrowers to exercise their option to default when their home values have declined below the outstanding mortgage balance, even if they have sufficient financial resources to make timely mortgage payments. Such a practice by borrowers is referred to as a "strategic default."

# Lien Status

The lien status of a mortgage indicates the lender's seniority in the event of the forced liquidation of the property owing to the borrower's default. For a mortgage that is a first lien, the lender would have first call on the proceeds of the liquidation of the property if it were to be repossessed. A mortgage could also be a second lien or junior lien, and the claims of the lender on the proceeds in the case of liquidation would come after the lender who had a first lien was paid in full.

# Credit Classification

In the United States, a mortgage originated for which the borrower is considered to be of high credit quality (i.e., the borrower has strong employment and credit histories, income sufficient to make the mortgage payments without compromising the borrower's creditworthiness, and substantial equity in the underlying property) is classified as a prime loan. A loan originated for which the borrower is of lower credit quality or where the loan is not a first lien on the property is classified as a subprime loan. Between the prime and the subprime sector is a somewhat nebulous category referred to as an alternative-A loan, or more commonly an alt-A loan. These loans are considered to be prime loans (the "A" refers to the A grade assigned by underwriting agencies), but they have some attributes that either increase their perceived credit riskiness or cause them to be difficult to categorize and evaluate.

When assessing the credit quality of a mortgage applicant, lenders look at various measures.

The starting point is the applicant's credit score. Several firms collect data on the payment histories of individuals from lending institutions and, using statistical models, evaluate and quantify individual creditworthiness in terms of a credit score. Basically, a credit score is a numerical grade for the credit history of the borrower. The three most popular credit reporting companies that compute credit scores are Experian, Transunion, and Equifax. Although the credit scores are determined using different methods, the scores generically are referred to as FICO scores. Typically, a lender will obtain more than one score, to minimize the impact of variations in credit scores across providers. FICO scores range from 350 to 850. The higher the FICO score is, the lower is the credit risk.

The LTV has proved to be a good predictor of default: the higher the LTV, the greater the likelihood of default. By definition, the LTV of the loan in a purchase transaction is a function of both the down payment and the purchase price of the property. Lenders calculate income ratios, such as the PTI, to assess the applicant's ability to pay. These ratios compare the monthly mortgage payment that the applicant would have to pay if the loan is granted to the applicant's monthly income. The most common measures are the front ratio and the back ratio. The front ratio is computed by dividing the total monthly payment (which includes interest and principal on the loan plus property taxes and homeowner insurance) by the applicant's pre-tax monthly income. The back ratio is computed in a similar manner. The modification is that the back ratio adds other debt payments, such as auto loan and credit card payments, to the total payments. For a loan to be classified as "prime," the front and back ratios should be no more than  $28\%$  and  $36\%$ , respectively.

The credit score is the primary attribute used to characterize loans as either prime or subprime. Prime (or A-grade) loans generally are made to borrowers with FICO scores of 660 or higher, front and back ratios with the above-noted maximums of  $28\%$  and  $36\%$ , and LTVs less than  $95\%$ . Alt-A loans may vary in a number of important ways. Although subprime loans typically are associated with borrower FICO scores below 660, the loan programs and grades are highly lender specific. One lender might consider a loan with a 620 FICO score to be a "B-rated loan," whereas another lender could grade the same loan higher or lower, especially if the other attributes of the loan (such as the LTV) are higher or lower than average levels.

Outside the United States, there are loans available to credit-impaired borrowers seeking to obtain a mortgage. For example, in the United Kingdom, such mortgages are referred to as "nonconforming" mortgages and include lending to individuals who had previously declared bankruptcy. Two other countries that make mortgages available to credit-impaired borrowers are Ireland and Spain (where lending is available to immigrants who want to reside in major Spanish cities and who have no or limited credit histories). Europe even has its version of Alt-A lending.[8]

# Credit Guarantees

Mortgages can be classified based on whether there is some third-party guaranty. The guaranty can be one provided by the national government, a related entity, or a private entity.

In the United States, loans that are backed by agencies of the federal government are referred to under the generic term of government loans and are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The Department of Housing and Urban Development oversees two agencies that guarantee government loans. The first is the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a governmental entity created by Congress in 1934 that became part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1965. FHA-insured loans are for those borrowers who can afford only a low down payment and who generally also have relatively low levels of income. The second is the Veterans Administration (VA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. VA-guaranteed loans are made to eligible veterans and reservists, allowing them to receive favorable loan terms. Although there is no maximum amount for the loans that are guaranteed, typically the loans are limited to an amount determined by statute, because when the VA sells loans that it originates in the secondary market, these limits become important, as explained later in this chapter and in chapter 30.

In contrast to government loans, other loans have no explicit guaranty from the federal government. Such loans are said to be obtained through "conventional financing" and therefore are referred to in the market as conventional mortgages. A conventional mortgage may not be insured when it is originated, but a mortgage may qualify to be insured when it is included in a pool of mortgages that secures a mortgage-backed security (MBS). More specifically, MBSs are securities issued by two government-sponsored enterprises, Freddie Mac (previously the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) and Fannie Mae (previously the Federal National Mortgage Association), entities we discuss in more detail in chapter 30. Because the guaranties of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae do not carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, they are not classified as government loans.

A conventional loan can be insured by a private mortgage insurer. Typically the borrower is required to obtain private mortgage insurance when the down payment is less than  $20\%$  of the property's purchase price (i.e., when the LTV is greater than 0.8). Because the insurance comes from a private entity, from an investor's perspective, the guaranty is only as good as the credit rating of the insurer.

Conforming versus Nonconforming Status

As explained in chapter 30, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) whose mission is to provide liquidity and support to the mortgage market. Although they are private corporations, they receive a charter from the federal government. This federal charter allows these GSEs to operate with certain benefits that are unavailable to other corporations. However, the federal charter imposes limits on their business activities.

One of the ways that they fulfill their mission is by buying and selling mortgages. The mortgages they purchase can be held in a portfolio or packaged to create an MBS. The securities they create are the subject of chapter 30. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy or sell any type of residential mortgage, but the mortgages that are packaged into securities are restricted to government loans and those that satisfy their underwriting guidelines. The conventional loans that qualify are referred to as conforming loans. Thus, a conforming loan is simply a conventional loan that meets the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Conventional loans in the market are referred to as conforming conventional loans or nonconforming conventional loans.

One of the underwriting standards is the loan balance at the time of origination. For government loans and the loans guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, there are limits on the loan balance. The maximum loan size for oneto four-family homes changes every year, based on the percentage change in the average home price (for both new and existing homes) published by the Federal Housing Finance Board. The loan limits for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are identical, because they are specified by the same statute. For example, effective January 1, 2013, the conforming limit for residential mortgages was 417,000 and is higher for areas designated as high-cost regions. Loans larger than the conforming limit for a given property type are referred to as jumbo mortgages.

Other important underwriting standards that must be satisfied relate to the following:

- the type of property (primary residence, vacation or second home, investment property),
- loan type (e.g., fixed rate, ARM),
- LTV ratio by loan type,
- the borrower's credit history, and
- documentation.

Qualifying for a conforming mortgage is important for both the borrower and the mortgage originator, because the two GSEs are the largest buyers of mortgages in the United States. Hence, mortgages that qualify as conforming loans have a greater probability of being purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be packaged into an MBS. As a result, they are available at lower interest rates than are nonconforming conventional mortgages.

When the term "conforming mortgage" is used in other countries, its meaning may be quite different. We mentioned in our discussion of the credit classification of mortgages that in the United Kingdom, the term used for mortgage loans made to credit-impaired borrowers is "nonconforming" mortgage loans. In the United States, such a mortgage would probably be classified as a subprime mortgage. A mortgage in the United Kingdom provided to a creditworthy borrower (however that might be defined in that country) is referred to as a "conforming mortgage." The important point here is that in other countries, the terms "conforming mortgage" and "nonconforming mortgage" have nothing to do with how the terms are used in the United States, where they simply (and exclusively) denote whether a mortgage satisfies the requirements of the two GSEs.

# Investment Risks

The principal investors in mortgage loans include thrifts and commercial banks. Pension funds and life insurance companies also invest in these loans, but their ownership is small compared to that of the banks and thrifts. Investors face four main risks when they invest in residential mortgage loans: (1) credit risk, (2) liquidity risk, (3) price risk, and (4) prepayment risk.

# Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that the homeowner/borrower will default. For FHAand VA-insured mortgages, this risk is minimal. For privately insured mortgages, the risk can be gauged by the credit rating of the private insurance company that has insured the mortgage. For conventional mortgages that are uninsured, the credit risk depends on the credit quality of the borrower. The LTV ratio provides a useful measure of the risk of loss of principal in case of default. When the LTV ratio is high, default is more likely, because the borrower has little equity in the property.

# Liquidity Risk

Although there is a secondary market for residential mortgages, which we discuss in chapter 30, the bid-ask spreads are nonetheless large compared to those of other debt instruments. That is, mortgages tend to be rather illiquid, because they are large and indivisible.

The price of a fixed-income instrument will move in the opposite direction from market interest rates. Thus, a rise in interest rates will decrease the price of a mortgage loan.

# Prepayment Risk

The three components of the monthly cash flow are (1) interest, (2) principal repayment (scheduled principal payment or amortization), and (3) any prepayment.

Prepayment risk is the risk associated with a mortgage's cash flow stemming from prepayments. More specifically, investors are concerned that borrowers will pay off a mortgage when prevailing mortgage rates fall below the borrower's mortgage rate. For example, if the borrower's mortgage rate on a mortgage originated five years ago is  $6\%$  and the prevailing mortgage rate (i.e., the rate at which a new mortgage can be obtained) is  $3.5\%$ , then there is an incentive for the borrower to refinance the mortgage. The decision to refinance will depend on several factors, but the single most important one is the prevailing mortgage rate compared to the borrower's mortgage rate.

The disadvantage to the investor is that the proceeds received from the repayment of the loan must be reinvested at a lower interest rate than that currently earned on the proceeds lent to the borrower. This risk is the same as that faced by an investor in a callable bond. However, unlike a callable bond, there is no premium that may have to be paid by the borrower in the case of a residential mortgage loan except possibly for a prepayment penalty mortgage. Any principal repaid in advance of the scheduled due date is paid at par value.

# Development of the Secondary Mortgage Market

The foundations for the secondary mortgage market can be traced back to the Great Depression and the legislation that followed. The response by Congress to the Great Depression and its effects on financial markets was to establish several public-purpose agencies. The Federal Reserve provided increased liquidity for commercial banks through the Federal Reserve discount window. Liquidity for thrifts was provided by the creation of the

Federal Home Loan Banks, which were granted the right to borrow from the Treasury. The purpose of creating the Federal Home Loan Banks was to construct a reserve credit system to support housing finance and provide relief for both homeowners and lending institutions impacted by the Great Depression.

Another creation of Congress to help the housing finance market was the FHA, intended to address the problems presented by the mortgage loans used in housing finance at that time. This government agency developed and promoted the fixed-rate, level-payment, fully amortized mortgage. The FHA also reduced credit risk for investors by offering insurance against mortgage defaults. Not all loans could be insured, however—the mortgage applicant had to satisfy FHA underwriting standards, which made the FHA the first organization to standardize mortgage terms. Although we may take standardization for granted today, it was the basis for the development of a secondary mortgage market. In 1944, the VA began insuring qualified loans.

But who was going to invest in these loans? Thrifts could do so, especially with the inducement provided by several tax and regulatory advantages at the time. But the investment would be illiquid in the absence of a market for trading mortgages. Congress thought of that, too. In 1938, it created a federal government agency, the Federal National Mortgage Association. This agency, now officially known as Fannie Mae, was charged with the creating a liquid secondary market for FHAand VA-insured loans, which it tried to accomplish by buying loans. Fannie Mae needed a funding source in case it faced a liquidity squeeze. Congress provided it by giving Fannie Mae a credit line with the Treasury.

In 1954, legislation transformed Fannie Mae from a government agency into a GSE. Despite the creation of Fannie Mae, the secondary mortgage market did not develop to any significant extent. During periods of tight money, Fannie Mae could do little to mitigate a housing crisis. In 1968, Congress divided Fannie Mae into two organizations: (1) the current Fannie Mae, and (2) the Government National Mortgage Association, popularly known as Ginnie Mae. Ginnie Mae's function is to use the "full faith and credit of the U.S. government" to support the FHA and VA mortgage market. Two years later, in 1970, Congress authorized Fannie Mae to purchase conventional loans (i.e., those not insured by the FHA or VA) and created the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (popularity known as Freddie Mac) to provide support for FHAand VA-insured mortgages and conventional mortgages.

Ginnie Mae accomplished its objective by guaranteeing securities issued by private entities that pooled loans together and then used these loans as collateral for the security sold. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae purchased loans, pooled them, and issued securities, using the pool of loans as collateral. The securities created are called "mortgage pass-through securities" and are described in chapter 30. They are purchased by many types of investors (domestic and foreign) who previously shunned investment in the mortgage market.

The driving force in the development of a strong secondary market for residential mortgage loans was a financial innovation that involved the packaging (or "pooling") of loans and the issuance of securities collateralized by these loans. As we explained in chapter 27, this process, called "asset securitization," is radically different from the traditional system for financing the acquisition of assets. The traditional system calls for one financial intermediary (such as a commercial bank, thrift, or insurance company) to (1) originate a loan; (2) retain the loan in its portfolio of assets, thereby accepting the credit risk associated with the loan; (3) service the loan by collecting payments and providing tax or other information to the borrower; and (4) obtain funds from the public with which to finance its assets (except for the small amount representing the institution's equity).

By using asset securitization, more than one institution may be involved in lending capital. In the case of mortgage activities, a lending scenario can look like this:

1. A thrift or commercial bank originates a loan.
2. The thrift or commercial bank sells its mortgages to an investment banking firm that creates a security backed by the pool of loans.
3. The investment banker obtains credit risk insurance for the pool of loans from a private insurance company.
4. The investment banker sells the right to service the loans to another thrift or a company specializing in servicing loans.
5. The investment banking firm sells the securities to individuals and institutional investors.

Besides the original bank or thrift, participants include an investment bank, an insurance company, another thrift, an individual, and other institutional investors. The bank or thrift in this case does not have to absorb the credit risk, service the mortgage, or provide the funding.

In 1970, Ginnie Mae pioneered and issued the first MBS. The following year, Freddie Mac issued its first MBS; and in 1981, Fannie Mae issued its first MBS. In the 1980s, private issuers of MBSs that did not use the backing of the three agencies but instead some form of private credit enhancement (described in chapter 30) began issuing MBSs backed by conventional residential mortgage loans.

The major setback to the market and to the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was the crisis in the subprime MBS market that began in the summer of 2007. We describe the crisis in chapter 30 and explain how it led to the placing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency in September 2008. In addition, we discuss proposals to terminate the existence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

# Key Points
- The mortgage market in any country is a collection of markets that includes a primary (or origination) market and a secondary market where mortgages trade.
- A mortgage is a pledge of property to secure payment of a debt with the property, typically a form of real estate.
- The types of real estate properties that can be mortgaged are divided into two broad categories: single-family residential properties and commercial properties. The former category includes houses, condominiums, and cooperatives.
- Commercial properties are income-producing properties: multifamily properties (i.e., apartment buildings), office buildings, industrial properties (including warehouses), shopping centers, hotels, and health care facilities (e.g., senior residential care facilities).
- Mortgage originators (i.e., the original lenders) include thrifts, commercial banks, and mortgage bankers.
- Mortgage originators charge an origination fee and may generate additional income in other ways.
- The two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, can purchase any type of loan; however, the only conventional loans they can securitize to create a mortgage-backed security (MBS) are conforming loans, that is, conventional loans that satisfy their underwriting standards.
- For a mortgage originator, "pipeline risk" refers to the risks associated with originating mortgages. This risk has two components, price risk and fallout risk.
- "Price risk refers" to the adverse effects on the value of the pipeline if mortgage rates in the market rise.
- Fallout risk is the risk that applicants or those who were issued commitment letters will not close (i.e., complete the transaction by purchasing the property with funds borrowed from the mortgage originator).
- The two primary quantitative underwriting standards used by lenders when determining whether to grant a loan are the payment-to-income (PTI) ratio and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.
- The PTI ratio is the ratio of monthly payments to monthly income and measures the ability of the applicant to make monthly payments (both mortgage and real estate tax payments). The lower this ratio is, the greater the likelihood that the applicant will be able to meet the required payments.
- The LTV ratio is the ratio of the amount of the loan to the market (or appraised) value of the property. The lower this ratio is, the greater the protection will be for the lender if the applicant defaults on the payments and the lender must repossess and sell the property.
- Every mortgage loan must be serviced. Servicing of a mortgage involves collecting monthly payments and forwarding proceeds to owners of the loan, sending payment notices to mortgagors, reminding mortgagors when payments are overdue, maintaining records of principal balances, administering an escrow balance for real estate taxes and insurance purposes, initiating foreclosure proceedings if necessary, and furnishing tax information to mortgagors when applicable.
- The different types of residential mortgages available in countries that have a mortgage market are classified according to the following attributes: interest rate type, repayment structure, treatment of prepayments, lender's recourse, lien status, credit classification, credit guarantees, and conforming versus nonconforming status.
- The interest rate on a mortgage determines the type of mortgage: a fixed-rate mortgage, an indexed adjustable-rate mortgage, a reviewable adjustable-rate mortgage, a rollover (renegotiable) mortgage, a hybrid mortgage, or a convertible mortgage.
- The method for repaying the principal over time is called the "repayment structure" and is typically paid monthly.
- A lender would prefer a mortgage where some principal is repaid over the mortgage's term in order to reduce the credit risk it faces when lending against the property.
- "Amortization" refers to the repayment of the principal borrowed as part of the monthly loan payment.
- An amortizing mortgage specifies a scheduled payment of principal that the borrower must make and is typical in most countries.
- With a fully amortizing mortgage, the monthly scheduled principal payments are such that when all scheduled principal payments are added up, the total is equal to the original mortgage balance.
- A partial amortizing mortgage is such that the total of the monthly scheduled principal payments is less than the original mortgage balance. A balloon payment must then be made at the end of the loan's term equal to the difference between the amount owed and the total principal payments.
- A prepayment is the amount of the payment made in excess of the monthly mortgage payment.
- A prepayment penalty mortgage mitigates the borrower's right to prepay by imposing a penalty for prepaying.
- With a recourse loan, the lender is entitled to have a claim against the borrower for the shortfall if a default occurs; with a nonrecourse mortgage, unless there is some claim of fraud, the lender does not have a claim against the borrower.
- Whether the lender is entitled to recourse in the case of a shortfall (default) varies by country. In the United States, all mortgages to purchase a residence are nonrecourse mortgages.
- The lien status of a mortgage indicates the lender's seniority in the event of the forced liquidation of the property as a result of the borrower's default.
- For a mortgage that is a first lien, the lender has a first call on the proceeds of the liquidation of the property if it were to be repossessed, whereas for a second lien or junior lien, the lender's claim on the proceeds in the case of liquidation comes after the first lien lenders are paid in full.
- In the United States, loans are classified by the creditworthiness of the borrower: a prime loan is one made to a borrower considered to be of high credit quality; a subprime loan is one made to a borrower of lower credit quality or where the loan is not a first lien on the property; and an Alternative-A loan (Alt-A loan) is made to a borrower considered to be of prime creditworthiness but with some attributes that either increase the borrower's perceived credit riskiness or cause the borrower to be difficult to categorize and evaluate.
- The applicant's credit score is the primary measure used to characterize loans as either prime or subprime.
- Mortgages can be classified based on whether there is a third-party guaranty. The guaranty can be one provided by the national government, a related entity, or a private entity.
- In the United States, loans that are backed by agencies of the federal government are referred to under the generic term "government loans" and are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
- Loans that have no explicit guaranty from the federal government are said to be "conventional mortgages."
- A conventional loan can be insured by a private mortgage insurer.
- A conforming loan is one that qualifies for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that it can be included in an MBS security that they issue.
- When investing in residential mortgage loans, investors are exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, price risk, and prepayment risk.
- The three components of the monthly cash flow from a mortgage are (1) interest, (2) principal repayment (scheduled principal payment or amortization), and (3) any prepayment.
- Prepayment risk is the risk associated with a mortgage's cash flow as a result of prepayments.
- Prepayment risk arises because the proceeds received from the repayment of the loan might have to be reinvested at a lower interest rate than that currently earned on the proceeds lent to the borrower.
- Prepayment risk is the same risk faced by an investor in a callable bond. However, unlike a callable bond, no premium has to be paid by the borrower in the case of a residential mortgage loan unless it is a prepayment penalty mortgage.
- The driving force in the development of a strong secondary market for residential mortgage loans was asset securitization: the packaging (or pooling) of loans and the issuance of securities collateralized by these loans.

# Appendix: Mortgage Mathematics

The amount of the monthly loan payment that represents the repayment of the principal borrowed is called the amortization. Traditionally, both FRMs and ARMs were fully amortizing loans. What this means is that the monthly mortgage payments made by the borrower are such that they not only provide the lender with the contractual interest but also are sufficient to completely repay the amount borrowed when the last monthly mortgage payment is made. Thus, for example, for a fully amortizing 30-year loan, at the end of the 360th month, the last mortgage payment is sufficient to pay off any loan balance, so that after that last payment, the amount owed is zero.

# Fully Amortizing Fixed-Rate Loans

Fully amortizing fixed-rate loans have a payment that is constant over the life of the loan. For example, suppose a loan has an original balance of  $200,000, a note rate of 7.5\%$ , and a term of 30 years. Then the monthly mortgage payment would be 1,398.43. The formula for calculating the monthly mortgage payment is

$$
M P = M B _ {0} \left[ \frac {i (1 + i) ^ {n}}{(1 + i) ^ {n} - 1} \right],
$$ where  MP =  monthly mortgage payment (),


M B_{0} =  original mortgage balance (),

$i =$  note rate divided by 12 (in decimal),

$n =$  number of months of the mortgage loan.

For example, suppose that

$$

M B _ {0} = \$ 2 0 0, 0 0 0, i = 0. 0 7 5 / 1 2 = 0. 0 0 6 2 5, \text {a n d} n = 3 6 0.

$$

Then the monthly payment is

$$

M P = \200,000\left[\frac{0.00625(1.00625)^{360}}{(1.00625)^{360} - 1}\right] = \1,398.43.

$$

To calculate the remaining mortgage balance at the end of any month, the following formula is used:

$$

M B _ {t} = M B _ {0} \bigg [ \frac {(1 + i) ^ {n} - (1 + i) ^ {t}}{(1 + i) ^ {n} - 1} \bigg ],

$$ where  $MB_{t} =$  mortgage balance after  $t$  months.

For example, suppose that for month 12 ( $t = 12$ ) we have:

$$
M B _ {0} = \ 2 0 0, 0 0 0; i = 0. 0 0 6 2 5; \text {a n d} n = 3 6 0.
$$

The mortgage balance at the end of month 12 is

$$
M B _ {t} = \\mathbb {S} 2 0 0, 0 0 0 \left[ \frac {(1 . 0 0 6 2 5) ^ {3 6 0} - (1 . 0 0 6 2 5) ^ {1 2}}{(1 . 0 0 6 2 5) ^ {3 6 0} - 1} \right] = \\mathbb {S} 1 9 8, 1 5 6. 3 3.
$$

To calculate the portion of the monthly mortgage payment that is the scheduled principal payment for a month, the following formula is used:

$$
S P _ {t} = M B _ {0} \bigg [ \frac {i (1 + i) ^ {t - 1}}{(1 + i) ^ {n} - 1} \bigg ],
$$ where  $SP_{t} =$  scheduled principal repayment for month  $t$ .


For example, suppose that for month 12 ( $t = 12$ ) we have:

$$

M B _ {0} = \ 2 0 0, 0 0 0; i = 0. 0 0 6 2 5; n = 3 6 0.

$$

Then the schedule principal repayment for month 12 is

$$

S P _ {1 2} = \ 2 0 0, 0 0 0 \left[ \frac {0 . 0 0 6 2 5 (1 . 0 0 6 2 5) ^ {1 2 - 1}}{(1 . 0 0 6 2 5) ^ {3 6 0} - 1} \right] = \ 1 5 8. 9 5.

$$

Assuming that the borrower has made all monthly payments on a timely basis, then, after the last monthly mortgage payment is made, the outstanding balance is zero (i.e., the loan is paid off). This can be seen in the schedule shown in table A29.1, which is referred to as an amortization schedule. (Not all 360 months are shown, to conserve space.) The column labeled "Principal Repayment" is the monthly amortization of the loan. Notice that in the 360th month, the ending balance is zero. Also note that in each month, the amount of the monthly mortgage payment applied to interest declines. This is because the amount of the outstanding balance declines each month.

In the case of an ARM, the monthly mortgage payment adjusts periodically. Thus, the monthly mortgage payments must be recalculated at each reset date. This process of resetting the mortgage loan payment is referred to as recasting the loan. For example, consider once again a  $200,000, 30-year loan. Assume that the loan adjusts annually and that the initial note rate (i.e., the note rate for the first 12 months) is 7.5\%$ . How much of the loan will be outstanding at the end of one year? We can determine this from table A29.1 by looking at the last column ("Ending Balance") for month 12. That amount is 198,156.33. (Alternatively, the formula given above can be used.) Now recasting the loan involves computing the monthly mortgage payment that will fully amortize a loan of  $198,156.33 for 29 years (348 months), because after one year there are 29 years remaining on the loan. The note rate used is the reset rate. Suppose that the reset rate is 8.5\%$ . Then the monthly mortgage payment to fully amortize the loan is 1,535.26, which is the monthly mortgage payment for the next 12 months.

# Interest-Only Mortgage

A mortgage that involves the payment of only interest and no principal for part of the life of the mortgage is an interest-only mortgage. With this type of loan, only interest is paid for a predetermined period, called the lockout period. After the lockout period, the loan is recast such that the monthly mortgage payments will be sufficient to fully amortize the original amount of the loan over the remaining term of the loan. The interest-only product can be an FRM, an ARM, or a hybrid ARM.

For example, consider a $200,000, 30-year interest-only loan with a lockout period of five years and a note rate of 7.5\% (i.e., an FRM). For the first 60 months, the monthly mortgage payment is only the monthly interest, which is $1,250 (7.5\% × $200,000/12). In the 61st month, the monthly mortgage payment must include both interest and amortization (principal repayment). The monthly mortgage payment for the remaining life of the mortgage loan is the payment necessary to fully amortize a $200,000 25-year loan with a note rate of 7.5\%. That monthly mortgage payment is 1,477.98.

Note that if the mortgage had been a 30-year fixed-rate loan at  $7.5\%$ , the monthly mortgage payment for the first five years would have been

$1,398.43 instead of$ 1,200 for the interest-only loan. This is the appealing feature of the interest-only loan. The homeowner can purchase a more expensive home using an interest-only loan. The disadvantage for the homeowner is that for the remaining term of the loan, the interest-only mortgage requires a higher monthly mortgage payment ( $1,477.98) than would a 30-year fully amortizing loan ($ 1,398.43). However, if the homeowner anticipates a rise in income, this could more than offset the impact of the higher monthly mortgage payment. From the lender's perspective, however, there is greater credit risk. This is because at the end of five years, the lender's exposure remains at 200,000 rather than being reduced by the amortization over the lockout period.
