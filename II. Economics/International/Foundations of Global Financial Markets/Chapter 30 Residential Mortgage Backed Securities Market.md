# Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Market

## Agency RMBS Market

### Agency Pass-Through Securities

#### Issuers of agency pass-through securities

##### Ginnie Mae

Ginnie Mae is a federally related institution, because it is part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. As a result, the pass-through securities that it guarantees carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government with respect to timely payment of both interest and principal.

That is, the interest and principal are paid when due even if mortgagors fail to make their monthly mortgage payment. The security guaranteed by Ginnie Mae is an MBS.

Although Ginnie Mae provides the guarantee, it is not the issuer. Pass-through securities that carry its guarantee and bear its name are issued by lenders it approves, such as thrifts, commercial banks, and mortgage bankers. These lenders receive approval only if the underlying loans satisfy the underwriting standards established by Ginnie Mae. When it guarantees securities issued by approved lenders, Ginnie Mae permits these lenders to convert illiquid individual loans into liquid securities backed by the U.S. government. In the process, Ginnie Mae accomplishes its goal of supplying funds to the residential mortgage market and providing an active secondary market. For the guarantee, Ginnie Mae receives a fee, called the "guaranty fee."

##### Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

As explained at the end of chapter 29, the mission of these two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) is to support the liquidity and stability of the mortgage market. They accomplish this by (1) buying and selling mortgages, (2) creating pass-through securities and guaranteeing them, and (3) buying MBSs. The mortgages purchased and held as investments by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are held in a portfolio referred to as the retained portfolio. However, the MBSs that they issue are not guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Instead, the payments to investors in the MBSs are secured first by the cash flow from the underlying pool of loans and then by a corporate guarantee. That corporate guarantee, however, is the same as the corporate guarantee to the other creditors of the two GSEs. As with Ginnie Mae, the two GSEs receive a guaranty fee for taking on the credit risk associated with borrowers failing to satisfy their loan obligations.

Although the securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are referred to in this chapter as "agency MBSs," they are also referred to as "conventional pass-through securities." This is because the collateral is typically conventional loans that conform to the underwriting standards of these two GSEs, as explained in chapter 29.

The pass-through securities issued by Fannie Mae are referred to as "MBSs"; Freddie Mac uses the term participation certificate (PC) to describe its pass-through security. All Fannie Mae MBSs are guaranteed with respect to the timely payment of interest and principal. Although the PCs that Freddie Mac now issues carry the same guarantee, there are some outstanding PCs that guarantee the timely payment of interest but the eventual return of principal within one year of the due date.

#### Prepayment risks associated with pass-through securities

An investor who owns pass-through securities does not know what the cash flow will be, because the cash flow depends on prepayments. The risk associated with prepayments is called prepayment risk.

To understand prepayment risk, consider the following example. Suppose an investor buys a $7.5\%$ coupon Ginnie Mae at a time when the mortgage rates are $7.5\%$. What will happen to prepayments if mortgage rates decline to, say, $5.5\%$? Homeowners will have the incentive to prepay all or part of their loan. Thus, the investor must reinvest the proceeds received at a lower interest rate. The second adverse consequence is that appreciation potential of the pass-through security is limited. With a decline in interest rates, the price of an option-free bond (such as a Treasury bond) will rise. In the case of a pass-through security, the rise in price will not be as large as that of an option-free bond because a fall in interest rates increases the probability that the market rate will fall below the rate at which the borrower is paying. This fall in rates gives the borrower an incentive to prepay the loan and refinance the debt at a lower rate. To the extent that this happens, the security holder will be repaid not at a price incorporating the premium but at par value. The holder risks capital loss, which reflects the fact that the anticipated reimbursements at par will not yield the initial cash flow.

The adverse consequences when mortgage rates decline are the same as those faced by holders of callable corporate and municipal bonds. As in the case of those instruments, the upside price potential of a pass-through security is truncated because of prepayments. This result should not be surprising, because a mortgage loan effectively grants the borrower the right to call the loan at par value. The adverse consequence when mortgage rates decline is referred to as contraction risk.

Now let's look at what happens if mortgage rates rise to $9.5\%$. The price of the pass-through, like the price of any bond, will decline. But again, it will decline more, because the higher rates will tend to slow down the rate of prepayment, in effect increasing the amount invested at the coupon rate, which is lower than the market rate. Prepayments will slow down, because homeowners will not refinance or partially prepay their mortgages when mortgage rates are higher than the contractual rate of $7.5\%$. Of course, it is just the time when investors want prepayments to speed up, so that they can reinvest the prepayments at the higher market interest rate. This adverse consequence of rising mortgage rates is called extension risk.

Therefore, prepayment risk encompasses contraction risk and extension risk. Prepayment risk makes pass-throughs unattractive for certain financial institutions to hold from an asset/liability perspective. Let's look at why particular institutional investors may find pass-throughs unattractive:

- Thrifts and commercial banks, as explained in chapter 4, want to lock in a spread over their cost of funds. Their funds are raised on a short-term basis. If they invest in fixed-rate pass-through securities, they mismatch, because a pass-through is a longer-term security. In particular, depository institutions are exposed to extension risk when they invest in pass-through securities.
- To satisfy certain obligations of insurance companies, pass-through securities may be unattractive. More specifically, let's consider a life insurance company that has issued a four-year guaranteed investment contract. The uncertainty about the cash flow from a pass-through security, and the likelihood that slow prepayments will result in the instrument being long term, make it an unappealing investment vehicle for such accounts. In such instances, a pass-through security exposes the insurance company to extension risk.
- A pension fund may want to fund a 15-year liability. Buying a pass-through security exposes the pension fund to the risk that prepayments will speed up and that the maturity of the investment will shorten to considerably less than 15 years. Prepayments speed up when interest rates decline, thereby forcing reinvestment of the prepaid amounts at a lower interest rate. In this case, the pension fund is open to contraction risk.

We can see that some institutional investors are concerned with extension risk and others with contraction risk when they purchase a pass-through security. Altering the cash flow of a pass-through so as to reduce the contraction risk and extension risk for institutional investors is explained later in this chapter when we cover CMOs.

#### Prepayment conventions

The only way to project a cash flow is to make some assumption about the prepayment rate over the life of the underlying mortgage pool. The prepayment rate assumed is called the prepayment speed, or simply, speed.

The conditional prepayment rate (CPR) assumes that some fraction of the remaining principal in the pool is prepaid each year for the remaining term of the mortgage. The prepayment rate assumed for a pool is based on the characteristics of the pool (including its historical prepayment experience) and the current and expected future economic environment. It is referred to as a "conditional rate," because it is conditional on the remaining mortgage balance.

The CPR is an annual prepayment rate. To estimate monthly prepayments, the CPR must be converted into a monthly prepayment rate, commonly referred to as the single-monthly mortality rate (SMM). The following formula can be used to determine the SMM for a given CPR:

$$
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - \mathrm{CPR})^{1/12}. \tag{30.1}
$$

Suppose that the CPR used to estimate prepayments is $6\%$. The corresponding SMM is

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - 0.06)^{1/12} \\
= 1 - (0.94)^{0.08333} = 0.005143. \\
\end{array}
$$

An SMM of $w\%$ means that approximately $w\%$ of the remaining mortgage balance at the beginning of the month, less the scheduled principal payment, will prepay that month. That is,

Prepayment for month $t = \mathrm{SMM} \times$ (Beginning mortgage balance for month $t -$ Scheduled principal payment for month $t$). (30.2)

For example, suppose that an investor owns a pass-through in which the remaining mortgage balance at the beginning of some month is \$290 million. Assuming that the SMM is 0.5143\% and the scheduled principal payment is \$3 million, the estimated prepayment for the month is

$$
0.005143 \times (\$290,000,000 - \$3,000,000) = \$1,476,041.
$$

The Public Securities Association (PSA) prepayment benchmark is expressed as a monthly series of annual prepayment rates. The PSA benchmark assumes that prepayment rates are low for newly originated mortgages and then speed up as the mortgages become seasoned.

The PSA benchmark assumes the following CPRs for 30-year mortgages:

- A CPR of $0.2\%$ for the first month, increased by $0.2\%$ per year per month for the next 30 months, when it reaches $6\%$ per year.
- A $6\%$ CPR for the remaining years.

This benchmark, referred to as "$100\%$ PSA," or simply, "$100$ PSA," is graphically depicted in figure 30.2. Mathematically, $100$ PSA can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\text{if } t \leq 30, \text{ then } \mathrm{CPR} = 6\%(t/30), \\
\text{if } t > 30, \text{ then } \mathrm{CPR} = 6\%, \\
\end{array}
$$
where $t$ is the number of months since the mortgage originated.

Figure 30.2 Graphical depiction of 100 PSA.

Slower or faster speeds are then referred to as some percentage of PSA. For example, "50 PSA" means one-half the CPR of the PSA benchmark prepayment rate; "150 PSA" means one and a half times the CPR of the PSA benchmark prepayment rate; "300 PSA" means three times the CPR of the benchmark prepayment rate. A prepayment rate of 0 PSA means that no prepayments are assumed.

The CPR is converted to an SMM using equation (30.1). For example, the SMMs for month 5, month 20, and months 31 through 360 assuming 100 PSA are calculated as follows:

For month 5:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{CPR} = 6\%(5/30) = 1\% = 0.01, \\
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - 0.01)^{1/12} \\
= 1 - (0.99)^{0.083333} = 0.000837. \\
\end{array}
$$

For month 20:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{CPR} = 6\%(20/30) = 4\% = 0.04, \\
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - 0.04)^{1/12} \\
= 1 - (0.96)^{0.083333} = 0.003396. \\
\end{array}
$$

For months 31 to 360:

$$
\mathrm{CPR} = 6\%
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - 0.06)^{1/12} \\
= 1 - (0.94)^{0.083333} = 0.004868. \\
\end{array}
$$

Assuming 165 PSA, the SMMs for month 5, month 20, and months 31 through 360 are computed as follows:

For month 5:

$$
\mathrm{CPR} = 6\%(5/30) = 1\% = 0.01,
$$

$$
165\mathrm{PSA} = 1.65(0.01) = 0.0165,
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - 0.0165)^{1/12} \\
= 1 - (0.9835)^{0.083333} = 0.001386. \\
\end{array}
$$

For month 20:

$$
\mathrm{CPR} = 6\%(20/30) = 4\% = 0.04,
$$

$$
165\mathrm{PSA} = 1.65(0.04) = 0.066,
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - 0.066)^{1/12} \\
= 1 - (0.934)^{0.083333} = 0.005674. \\
\end{array}
$$

For months 31 to 360:

$$
\mathrm{CPR} = 6\%
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
165\mathrm{PSA} = 1.65(0.06) = 0.099, \\
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - 0.099)^{1/12} \\
= 1 - (0.901)^{0.083333} = 0.00865. \\
\end{array}
$$

Notice that the SMM assuming 165 PSA is not just 1.65 times the SMM assuming 100 PSA. It is the CPR that is a multiple of the CPR assuming 100 PSA.

#### Illustration of monthly cash flow construction

We now show how to construct a monthly cash flow for a hypothetical pass-through given a PSA assumption. For the purpose of this illustration, the underlying mortgages for this hypothetical pass-through are assumed to be fixed-rate, level-payment mortgages, and the pass-through rate is assumed to be $7.5\%$. Furthermore, it is assumed that the weighted average maturity (WAM) of the pool of mortgages is 357 months. $^{1}$

Table 30.1 shows the cash flow for selected months assuming 100 PSA. The cash flow breaks down into three components: (1) interest (based on the pass-through rate), (2) the regularly scheduled principal repayment, and (3) prepayments based on 100 PSA.

### The Subprime Mortgage Crisis and Securitization

## Key Points

- A mortgage pass-through security is created when one or more holders of loans form a collection (pool) of loans and sell shares or participation certificates in the pool.
- Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are created from pass-through securities to address the prepayment risks associated with investing in pass-through securities: contraction risk and extension risk.
- A CMO sets forth rules for the distribution of interest and principal repayment to the different bond classes in the structure.
- CMO tranches are created to meet the different needs of institutional investors.
- Agency CMOs are an example of time tranching.
- Like a CMO, a stripped MBS is created from a pass-through security.
- The purpose of creating a stripped MBS is to provide an instrument that can be used to control the risk of a portfolio of mortgage-related securities.
- The private-label RMBS market was at one time classified into prime RMBS and subprime RMBS sectors, according to the credit quality of the borrowers.
- Subprime RMBS structures are more complicated and require more credit enhancement than prime RMBS structures.
- The subprime mortgage meltdown began in the summer of 2007 and has been attributed to the collapse of the subprime housing finance market

## Questions

## Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

- the process of securitizing residential mortgage loans;
- what is meant by prepayment risk, and how prepayments are measured;
- the different sectors in the residential mortgage-backed securities market: agency and private label;
- the different types of agency mortgage-backed securities and their investment characteristics: pass-through securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and stripped mortgage-backed securities;
- the motivation for the creation of collateralized mortgage obligations and the different types of tranches/bond classes;
- how tranches with different prepayment risks are created in a collateralized mortgage obligation;
- the difference between prime and subprime residential mortgage-backed securities; the subprime crisis in 2007.

As explained in chapter 29, investing in residential mortgage loans exposes the investor to default risk, price risk, liquidity risk, and prepayment risk. A more efficient way to participate in this market is to invest in a security that is backed by a pool of these loans. This type of security is created by applying the same securitization technology described in chapter 27 for creating an asset-backed security (ABS). A residential mortgage loan used as collateral to create the security is said to be "securitized." The general term for a security created through the securitization technology process where the security is backed by a real-estate related mortgage loan is called a mortgage-backed security (MBS). More specifically, an MBS is a security created when one or more holders of mortgage loans form a collection (pool) of loans and sell shares or participation certificates in the pool. A pool may consist of several thousand loans or only a few. Risk-averse investors prefer investing in a pool to investing in a single mortgage, partly because a mortgage pass-through security is considerably more liquid than for an individual mortgage.

Two sectors are classified in the MBS market, based on whether the loan securities are for residential mortgage loans or for commercial mortgage loans. We discussed residential mortgage loans in chapter 29, and we describe commercial mortgage loans in chapter 31. An MBS backed by residential mortgage loans is called a residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS), and this market is the subject of this chapter. An MBS backed by commercial mortgage loans is called a commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) and is covered in chapter 31, where we describe the commercial real-estate market.

As explained in chapter 29, the residential mortgage market can be divided into two subsectors based on the credit quality of the borrower: the prime mortgage market and the subprime mortgage market. The former sector includes (1) loans that satisfy the underwriting standards of the Government National Mortgage Association (known as "Ginnie Mae"), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac (i.e., conforming loans) and (2) those that fail to conform for a reason other than credit quality, or if the loan is not a first lien on the property. The subprime mortgage sector is the market for loans provided to borrowers with an impaired credit rating or for whom the loan is a second lien.

The RMBS market is divided into two sectors based on the characteristics of the loan. As explained in chapter 29, a conforming loan is one that satisfies the underwriting standard of the agencies. An RMBS that uses conforming loans is called an agency RMBS. Nonconforming loans can also be used to create an RMBS, and a security using such loans is referred to as a private-label RMBS or a nonagency RMBS. In turn, the private-label RMBS historically has been further classified on whether the collateral for the security is composed of prime residential mortgage loans or subprime residential mortgage loans, which we described in chapter 29. An RMBS backed by the latter are referred to as a subprime RMBS.

This chapter is divided into two major sections. The first is the agency RMBS market, and the second is the private-label RMBS market.

The agency RMBS market is the largest sector of the U.S. investment-grade market. That is, of all securities that have an investment-grade rating (a category that includes U.S. Treasury securities), the agency RMBS market has been the largest sector. The size of this sector has varied from  $35\%$  to  $45\%$  of the investment-grade market since 2000.

The agency MBS market includes three types of securities: agency mortgage pass-through securities, agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and agency stripped MBS. As we explain below, agency stripped MBS and agency CMOs are created from mortgage pass-through securities. Agency MBSs are the subject of this section.

## Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

- the process of securitizing residential mortgage loans;
- what is meant by prepayment risk, and how prepayments are measured;
- the different sectors in the residential mortgage-backed securities market: agency and private label;
- the different types of agency mortgage-backed securities and their investment characteristics: pass-through securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and stripped mortgage-backed securities;
- the motivation for the creation of collateralized mortgage obligations and the different types of tranches/bond classes;
- how tranches with different prepayment risks are created in a collateralized mortgage obligation;
- the difference between prime and subprime residential mortgage-backed securities; the subprime crisis in 2007.

As explained in chapter 29, investing in residential mortgage loans exposes the investor to default risk, price risk, liquidity risk, and prepayment risk. A more efficient way to participate in this market is to invest in a security that is backed by a pool of these loans. This type of security is created by applying the same securitization technology described in chapter 27 for creating an asset-backed security (ABS). A residential mortgage loan used as collateral to create the security is said to be "securitized." The general term for a security created through the securitization technology process where the security is backed by a real-estate related mortgage loan is called a mortgage-backed security (MBS). More specifically, an MBS is a security created when one or more holders of mortgage loans form a collection (pool) of loans and sell shares or participation certificates in the pool. A pool may consist of several thousand loans or only a few. Risk-averse investors prefer investing in a pool to investing in a single mortgage, partly because a mortgage pass-through security is considerably more liquid than for an individual mortgage.

Two sectors are classified in the MBS market, based on whether the loan securities are for residential mortgage loans or for commercial mortgage loans. We discussed residential mortgage loans in chapter 29, and we describe commercial mortgage loans in chapter 31. An MBS backed by residential mortgage loans is called a residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS), and this market is the subject of this chapter. An MBS backed by commercial mortgage loans is called a commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) and is covered in chapter 31, where we describe the commercial real-estate market.

As explained in chapter 29, the residential mortgage market can be divided into two subsectors based on the credit quality of the borrower: the prime mortgage market and the subprime mortgage market. The former sector includes (1) loans that satisfy the underwriting standards of the Government National Mortgage Association (known as "Ginnie Mae"), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac (i.e., conforming loans) and (2) those that fail to conform for a reason other than credit quality, or if the loan is not a first lien on the property. The subprime mortgage sector is the market for loans provided to borrowers with an impaired credit rating or for whom the loan is a second lien.

The RMBS market is divided into two sectors based on the characteristics of the loan. As explained in chapter 29, a conforming loan is one that satisfies the underwriting standard of the agencies. An RMBS that uses conforming loans is called an agency RMBS. Nonconforming loans can also be used to create an RMBS, and a security using such loans is referred to as a private-label RMBS or a nonagency RMBS. In turn, the private-label RMBS historically has been further classified on whether the collateral for the security is composed of prime residential mortgage loans or subprime residential mortgage loans, which we described in chapter 29. An RMBS backed by the latter are referred to as a subprime RMBS.

This chapter is divided into two major sections. The first is the agency RMBS market, and the second is the private-label RMBS market.

The agency RMBS market is the largest sector of the U.S. investment-grade market. That is, of all securities that have an investment-grade rating (a category that includes U.S. Treasury securities), the agency RMBS market has been the largest sector. The size of this sector has varied from  $35\%$  to  $45\%$  of the investment-grade market since 2000.

The agency MBS market includes three types of securities: agency mortgage pass-through securities, agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and agency stripped MBS. As we explain below, agency stripped MBS and agency CMOs are created from mortgage pass-through securities. Agency MBSs are the subject of this section.

# Agency Pass-Through Securities

The cash flow of a mortgage pass-through security depends on the cash flow of the underlying mortgage loans. As explained in chapter 29, the cash flow consists of monthly mortgage payments representing interest, the scheduled repayment of principal, and any prepayments.

Payments are made to security holders each month. The amounts and the timing of the cash flow from the pool of mortgages and the cash flow passed through to investors, however, are not identical. The monthly cash flow for a pass-through security is less than the monthly cash flow of the underlying mortgages by an amount equal to the servicing and other fees. The other fees are those charged by the issuer or guarantor of the pass-through security for guaranteeing the issue (discussed later).

The timing of the cash flow also differs. The monthly mortgage payment is due from each mortgagor on the first day of each month, but a delay affects the passing through of the corresponding monthly cash flow to the security holders. The length of the delay varies by the type of pass-through security.

Figure 30.1 illustrates the process of creating a mortgage pass-through security.

Figure 30.1

Creation of a mortgage pass-through security.

Issuers of agency pass-through securities Agency pass-through securities are issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. These three entities were created by Congress to increase the supply of capital to the residential mortgage market and to provide support for an active secondary market.

Ginnie Mae Ginnie Mae is a federally related institution, because it is part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. As a result, the pass-through securities that it guarantees carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government with respect to timely payment of both interest and principal.

That is, the interest and principal are paid when due even if mortgagors fail to make their monthly mortgage payment. The security guaranteed by Ginnie Mae is an MBS.

Although Ginnie Mae provides the guarantee, it is not the issuer. Pass-through securities that carry its guarantee and bear its name are issued by lenders it approves, such as thrifts, commercial banks, and mortgage bankers. These lenders receive approval only if the underlying loans satisfy the underwriting standards established by Ginnie Mae. When it guarantees securities issued by approved lenders, Ginnie Mae permits these lenders to convert illiquid individual loans into liquid securities backed by the U.S. government. In the process, Ginnie Mae accomplishes its goal of supplying funds to the residential mortgage market and providing an active secondary market. For the guarantee, Ginnie Mae receives a fee, called the "guaranty fee."

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac As explained at the end of chapter 29, the mission of these two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) is to support the liquidity and stability of the mortgage market. They accomplish this by (1) buying and selling mortgages, (2) creating pass-through securities and guaranteeing them, and (3) buying MBSs. The mortgages purchased and held as investments by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are held in a portfolio referred to as the retained portfolio. However, the MBSs that they issue are not guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Instead, the payments to investors in the MBSs are secured first by the cash flow from the underlying pool of loans and then by a corporate guarantee. That corporate guarantee, however, is the same as the corporate guarantee to the other creditors of the two GSEs. As with Ginnie Mae, the two GSEs receive a guaranty fee for taking on the credit risk associated with borrowers failing to satisfy their loan obligations.

Although the securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are referred to in this chapter as "agency MBSs," they are also referred to as "conventional pass-through securities." This is because the collateral is typically conventional loans that conform to the underwriting standards of these two GSEs, as explained in chapter 29.

The pass-through securities issued by Fannie Mae are referred to as "MBSs"; Freddie Mac uses the term participation certificate (PC) to describe its pass-through security. All Fannie Mae MBSs are guaranteed with respect to the timely payment of interest and principal. Although the PCs that Freddie Mac now issues carry the same guarantee, there are some outstanding PCs that guarantee the timely payment of interest but the eventual return of principal within one year of the due date.

Prepayment risks associated with pass-through securities An investor who owns pass-through securities does not know what the cash flow will be, because the cash flow depends on prepayments. The risk associated with prepayments is called prepayment risk.

To understand prepayment risk, consider the following example. Suppose an investor buys a  $7.5\%$  coupon Ginnie Mae at a time when the mortgage rates are  $7.5\%$ . What will happen to prepayments if mortgage rates decline to, say,  $5.5\%$ ? Homeowners will have the incentive to prepay all or part of their loan. Thus, the investor must reinvest the proceeds received at a lower interest rate. The second adverse consequence is that appreciation potential of the pass-through security is limited. With a decline in interest rates, the price of an option-free bond (such as a Treasury bond) will rise. In the case of a pass-through security, the rise in price will not be as large as that of an option-free bond because a fall in interest rates increases the probability that the market rate will fall below the rate at which the borrower is paying. This fall in rates gives the borrower an incentive to prepay the loan and refinance the debt at a lower rate. To the extent that this happens, the security holder will be repaid not at a price incorporating the premium but at par value. The holder risks capital loss, which reflects the fact that the anticipated reimbursements at par will not yield the initial cash flow.

The adverse consequences when mortgage rates decline are the same as those faced by holders of callable corporate and municipal bonds. As in the case of those instruments, the upside price potential of a pass-through security is truncated because of prepayments. This result should not be surprising, because a mortgage loan effectively grants the borrower the right to call the loan at par value. The adverse consequence when mortgage rates decline is referred to as contraction risk.

Now let's look at what happens if mortgage rates rise to  $9.5\%$ . The price of the pass-through, like the price of any bond, will decline. But again, it will decline more, because the higher rates will tend to slow down the rate of prepayment, in effect increasing the amount invested at the coupon rate, which is lower than the market rate. Prepayments will slow down, because homeowners will not refinance or partially prepay their mortgages when mortgage rates are higher than the contractual rate of  $7.5\%$ . Of course, it is just the time when investors want prepayments to speed up, so that they can reinvest the prepayments at the higher market interest rate. This adverse consequence of rising mortgage rates is called extension risk.

Therefore, prepayment risk encompasses contraction risk and extension risk. Prepayment risk makes pass-throughs unattractive for certain financial institutions to hold from an asset/liability perspective. Let's look at why particular institutional investors may find pass-throughs unattractive:

1. Thrifts and commercial banks, as explained in chapter 4, want to lock in a spread over their cost of funds. Their funds are raised on a short-term basis. If they invest in fixed-rate pass-through securities, they mismatch, because a pass-through is a longer-term security. In particular, depository institutions are exposed to extension risk when they invest in pass-through securities.
2. To satisfy certain obligations of insurance companies, pass-through securities may be unattractive. More specifically, let's consider a life insurance company that has issued a four-year guaranteed investment contract. The uncertainty about the cash flow from a pass-through security, and the likelihood that slow prepayments will result in the instrument being long term, make it an unappealing investment vehicle for such accounts. In such instances, a pass-through security exposes the insurance company to extension risk.
3. A pension fund may want to fund a 15-year liability. Buying a pass-through security exposes the pension fund to the risk that prepayments will speed up and that the maturity of the investment will shorten to considerably less than 15 years. Prepayments speed up when interest rates decline, thereby forcing reinvestment of the prepaid amounts at a lower interest rate. In this case, the pension fund is open to contraction risk.

We can see that some institutional investors are concerned with extension risk and others with contraction risk when they purchase a pass-through security. Altering the cash flow of a pass-through so as to reduce the contraction risk and extension risk for institutional investors is explained later in this chapter when we cover CMOs.

Prepayment conventions The only way to project a cash flow is to make some assumption about the prepayment rate over the life of the underlying mortgage pool. The prepayment rate assumed is called the prepayment speed, or simply, speed.

The conditional prepayment rate (CPR) assumes that some fraction of the remaining principal in the pool is prepaid each year for the remaining term of the mortgage. The prepayment rate assumed for a pool is based on the characteristics of the pool (including its historical prepayment experience) and the current and expected future economic environment. It is referred to as a "conditional rate," because it is conditional on the remaining mortgage balance.

The CPR is an annual prepayment rate. To estimate monthly prepayments, the CPR must be converted into a monthly prepayment rate, commonly referred to as the single-monthly mortality rate (SMM). The following formula can be used to determine the SMM for a given CPR:

$$
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - \mathrm{CPR})^{1/12}. \tag{30.1}
$$

Suppose that the CPR used to estimate prepayments is $6\%$. The corresponding SMM is

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{SMM} = 1 - (1 - 0.06)^{1/12} \\
= 1 - (0.94)^{0.08333} = 0.005143. \\
\end{array}
$$

An SMM of  $w\%$  means that approximately  $w\%$  of the remaining mortgage balance at the beginning of the month, less the scheduled principal payment, will prepay that month. That is,

Prepayment for month  $t = \mathrm{SMM} \times$  (Beginning mortgage balance for month  $t -$  Scheduled principal payment for month  $t$ ). (30.2)

For example, suppose that an investor owns a pass-through in which the remaining mortgage balance at the beginning of some month is \$290 million. Assuming that the SMM is 0.5143\% and the scheduled principal payment is \$3 million, the estimated prepayment for the month is

$$
0. 0 0 5 1 4 3 \times (\$ 2 9 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 - \$ 3, 0 0 0, 0 0 0) = \$ 1, 4 7 6, 0 4 1.
$$

The Public Securities Association (PSA) prepayment benchmark is expressed as a monthly series of annual prepayment rates. The PSA benchmark assumes that prepayment rates are low for newly originated mortgages and then speed up as the mortgages become seasoned.

The PSA benchmark assumes the following CPRs for 30-year mortgages:

1. A CPR of  $0.2\%$  for the first month, increased by  $0.2\%$  per year per month for the next 30 months, when it reaches  $6\%$  per year.
2. A  $6\%$  CPR for the remaining years.

This benchmark, referred to as " $100\%$  PSA," or simply, " $100$  PSA," is graphically depicted in figure 30.2. Mathematically,  $100$  PSA can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {if} t \leq 30, \text {then} \mathrm{CPR} = 6 \% (t / 30), \\ \mathrm{if} t > 30, \mathrm{then}\mathrm{CPR} = 6\% , \\ \end{array}
$$ where  $t$  is the number of months since the mortgage originated.

Figure 30.2 Graphical depiction of 100 PSA.

Slower or faster speeds are then referred to as some percentage of PSA. For example, “50 PSA” means one-half the CPR of the PSA benchmark prepayment rate; “150 PSA” means one and a half times the CPR of the PSA benchmark prepayment rate; “300 PSA” means three times the CPR of the benchmark prepayment rate. A prepayment rate of 0 PSA means that no prepayments are assumed.

The CPR is converted to an SMM using equation (30.1). For example, the SMMs for month 5, month 20, and months 31 through 360 assuming 100 PSA are calculated as follows:

For month 5:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{CPR} = 6\% (5 / 30) = 1\% = 0.01, \\ \mathrm {S M M} = 1 - (1 - 0. 0 1) ^ {1 / 1 2} \\ = 1 - (0. 9 9) ^ {0. 0 8 3 3 3 3} = 0. 0 0 0 8 3 7. \\ \end{array}

$$

For month 20:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{CPR} = 6\% (20 / 30) = 4\% = 0.04, \\ \mathrm {S M M} = 1 - (1 - 0. 0 4) ^ {1 / 1 2} \\ = 1 - (0. 9 6) ^ {0. 0 8 3 3 3 3} = 0. 0 0 3 3 9 6. \\ \end{array}

$$

For months 31 to 360:

$$

\mathrm{CPR} = 6\%

$$

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {S M M} = 1 - (1 - 0. 0 6) ^ {1 / 1 2} \\ = 1 - (0. 9 8 3 5) ^ {0. 0 8 3 3 3 3} = 0. 0 0 1 3 8 6. \\ \end{array}

$$

Assuming 165 PSA, the SMMs for month 5, month 20, and months 31 through 360 are computed as follows:

For month 5:

$$

\mathrm{CPR} = 6\% (5 / 30) = 1\% = 0.01,

$$

$$

1 6 5 \mathrm {P S A} = 1. 6 5 (0. 0 1) = 0. 0 1 6 5,

$$

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {S M M} = 1 - (1 - 0. 0 1 6 5) ^ {1 / 1 2} \\ = 1 - (0. 9 8 3 5) ^ {0. 0 8 3 3 3 3} = 0. 0 0 1 3 8 6. \\ \end{array}

$$

For month 20:

$$

\mathrm{CPR} = 6\% (20 / 30) = 4\% = 0.04,

$$

$$

1 6 5 \mathrm {P S A} = 1. 6 5 (0. 0 4) = 0. 0 6 6,

$$

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {S M M} = 1 - (1 - 0. 0 6 6) ^ {1 / 1 2} \\ = 1 - (0. 9 3 4) ^ {0. 0 8 3 3 3 3} = 0. 0 0 5 6 7 4. \\ \end{array}

$$

For months 31 to 360:

$$

\mathrm{CPR} = 6\%

$$

$$

\begin{array}{l} 1 6 5 \mathrm {P S A} = 1. 6 5 (0. 0 6) = 0. 0 9 9, \\ \mathrm {S M M} = 1 - (1 - 0. 0 9 9) ^ {1 / 1 2} \\ = 1 - (0. 9 0 1) ^ {0. 0 8 3 3 3 3} = 0. 0 0 8 6 5. \\ \end{array}

$$

Notice that the SMM assuming 165 PSA is not just 1.65 times the SMM assuming 100 PSA. It is the CPR that is a multiple of the CPR assuming 100 PSA.

Illustration of monthly cash flow construction We now show how to construct a monthly cash flow for a hypothetical pass-through given a PSA assumption. For the purpose of this illustration, the underlying mortgages for this hypothetical pass-through are assumed to be fixed-rate, level-payment mortgages, and the pass-through rate is assumed to be  $7.5\%$ . Furthermore, it is assumed that the weighted average maturity (WAM) of the pool of mortgages is 357 months. $^{1}$

Table 30.1 shows the cash flow for selected months assuming 100 PSA. The cash flow breaks down into three components: (1) interest (based on the pass-through rate), (2) the regularly scheduled principal repayment, and (3) prepayments based on 100 PSA.

Note: Pass-through rate = 7.5\%; WAC = 8.125\%; WAM = 357 months.

Let's walk through table 30.1 column by column:
- Column 1 ("Month"): This indicates the month.
- Column 2 ("Outstanding Balance"): The outstanding mortgage balance at the beginning of the month equals the outstanding balance at the beginning of the previous month reduced by the total principal payment in the previous month.
- Column 3 ("SMM," Single-Monthly Mortality): The SMM for 100 PSA changes, based on the assumptions for the CPR. Two aspects of this column should be noted. First, for month 1, the SMM is for a pass-through that has seasoned three months; that is, the CPR is  $0.8\%$ , because the WAM is 357. Second, from month 27 on, the SMM is 0.00514, which corresponds to a CPR of  $6\%$ .
- Column 4 ("Mortgage Payment"): The total monthly mortgage payment declines over time as prepayments reduce the mortgage balance outstanding. A formula determines what the monthly balance will be for each month given prepayments.[2]
- Column 5 ("Net Interest"): The monthly interest paid to the pass-through investor is determined by multiplying the outstanding mortgage balance at the beginning of the month by the pass-through rate of  $7.5\%$  and dividing by 12.
- Column 6 ("Scheduled Principal"): The regularly scheduled principal repayment is the difference between the total monthly mortgage payment (the amount shown in column 4) and the gross coupon interest for the month. The gross coupon interest is  $8.125\%$  multiplied by the outstanding mortgage balance at the beginning of the month, then divided by 12.
- Column 7 ("Prepayment"): The prepayment for the month is found by using equation (30.2). So, for example, in month 100, the beginning mortgage balance is  \$231,249,776, the scheduled principal payment is\$ 332,298, and the SMM at 100 PSA is 0.00514301 (only 0.00514 is shown in the table, to save space), so the prepayment is 0.00514301( $231,249,776 -$ 332,928) = 1,187,608.
- Column 8 ("Total Principal"): The total principal payment combines the scheduled principal payment and the prepayment amounts from columns 6 and 7.
- Column 9 ("Total Cash Flow"): The projected monthly cash flow for this pass-through is the sum of the interest paid to the pass-through investor in column 5 and the total principal payments for the month in column 8.

Table 30.2 shows selected monthly cash flows for the same pass-through but assuming 165 PSA.

Average Life The stated maturity of a mortgage pass-through security is an inappropriate measure of the security's life because of prepayments. Instead, market participants commonly use the security's average life. The average life of an MBS is the average time to receipt of principal payments (scheduled principal payments and projected prepayments), weighted by the amount of principal expected. Mathematically, the average life is expressed as follows:

$$

\text {A v e r a g e l i f e} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \frac {t \times \text {P r i n c i p a l r e c e i v e d a t t i m e} t}{1 2 (\text {T o t a l p r i n c i p a l})},

$$ where  $T$  is the number of months.

The average life of a pass-through depends on the PSA prepayment assumption. To see this, the average life (in years) is shown below for different prepayment speeds for the pass-through used to illustrate the cash flow for 100 PSA and 165 PSA in table 30.1 and table 30.2:

# U.S. Agency CMOs

Some institutional investors are concerned with extension risk and others with contraction risk when they invest in a pass-through. This problem can be mitigated by redirecting the cash flows of mortgage pass-through securities to different bond classes, called tranches, so as to create securities that have different exposure to prepayment risk and, therefore, risk/return patterns that differ from those of the pass-through securities from which the tranches were created.

When the cash flows of pools of mortgage pass-through securities are redistributed to different bond classes, the resulting securities are called agency collateralized mortgage obligations. The creation of an agency CMO cannot eliminate prepayment risk; it can only distribute the various forms of this risk among different classes of bondholders. The CMO's major financial innovation is that the securities created more closely satisfy the asset/liability needs of institutional investors and thus broaden the appeal of mortgage-backed products to traditional bond investors.

Rather than list the different types of tranches that can be created in a CMO structure, we show how the tranches can be created as an illustration of financial engineering. Although many different types of CMOs have been created, we look at just three of the key innovations in the CMO market: sequential-pay tranches, accrual tranches, and planned amortization class tranches. Two other important tranches that are not illustrated here are the floating-rate tranche and the inverse floating-rate tranche.

Sequential-pay tranches The first CMO was created in 1983 and was structured so that each class of bond would be retired sequentially. Such structures are referred to as sequential-pay CMOs. To illustrate a sequential-pay CMO, we discuss CMO-1, a hypothetical deal made up to illustrate the basic features of the structure. The collateral for this hypothetical CMO is a pass-through with a total par value of 400 million and the following characteristics: (1) the pass-through coupon rate is 7.5\%, (2) the WAC is 8.125\%, and (3) the WAM is 357 months. We used this same pass-through earlier in the chapter to describe the cash flow of a pass-through based on some PSA assumptions.

From this 400 million of collateral, four bond classes or tranches are created. Their characteristics are summarized in table 30.3. The total par value of the four tranches is equal to the par value of the collateral (i.e., the pass-through security). In this simple structure, the coupon rate is the same for each tranche and is also the same as the coupon rate on the collateral. In reality, the coupon rate typically varies by tranche.

Notes: The payment rules are as follows. 1. For payment of periodic coupon interest: Disburse periodic coupon interest to each tranche based on the amount of principal outstanding at the beginning of the period. 2. For disbursement of principal payments: Disburse principal payments to tranche A until it is completely paid off. After tranche A is completely paid off, disburse principal payments to tranche B until it is completely paid off. After tranche B is completely paid off, disburse principal payments to tranche C until it is completely paid off. After tranche C is completely paid off, disburse principal payments to tranche D until it is completely paid off.

We recall here that a CMO is created by redistributing the cash flow—interest and principal—to the different tranches based on a set of payment rules. The payment rules in the note at the bottom of table 30.3 describe how the cash flow from the pass-through (i.e., collateral) is to be distributed to the four tranches. Separate rules determine the payment of the coupon interest and the payment of the principal, the principal being the total of the regularly scheduled principal payment and any prepayments.

In CMO-1, each tranche receives periodic coupon interest payments based on the amount of the outstanding balance at the beginning of the month. The disbursement of the principal, however, is made in a special way. A tranche is not entitled to receive principal until the entire principal of the tranche before it in the priority structure is paid off. More specifically, tranche A receives all the principal payments until the entire principal amount owed to that bond class,  \$194,500,000, is paid off; then tranche B begins to receive principal and continues to do so until it is paid the entire\$ 36,000,000. Tranche C then receives principal, and when it is paid off, tranche D starts receiving principal payments.

Although the priority rules for the disbursement of the principal payments are known, the precise amount of the principal in each period is not. This amount depends on the cash flow and therefore on the principal payments of the collateral, which depend on the actual prepayment rate of the collateral. An assumed PSA speed allows the cash flow to be projected. Table 30.2 shows the cash flow (interest, regularly scheduled principal repayment, and prepayments) assuming 165 PSA. Assuming that the collateral does prepay at 165 PSA, the cash flow available to all four tranches in CMO-1 will be precisely the cash flow shown in table 30.2.

To demonstrate how the priority rules for CMO-1 work, table 30.4 shows the cash flow for selected months, assuming the collateral prepays at 165 PSA. For each tranche, the table shows (1) the balance at the end of the month, (2) the principal paid down (regularly scheduled principal repayment plus prepayments), and (3) interest. In month 1, the cash flow for the collateral consists of a principal payment of  \$709,923 and an interest payment of\$ 2.5 million (0.075 × \$400 million/12). The interest payment is distributed to the four tranches based on the amount of the par value outstanding. So, for example, tranche A receives  $1,215,625 (0.075 ×$ 194,500,000/12) of the \$2.5 million. The principal, however, is all distributed to tranche A. Therefore, the cash flow for tranche A in month 1 is \$1,925,548. The principal balance at the end of month 1 for tranche A is \$193,790,076 (Original principal balance of \$194,500,000 - Principal payment of \$709,923). No principal payment is distributed to the three other tranches, because a principal balance is still outstanding for tranche A. This scenario will be true for months 2 through 80.

After month 81, the principal balance will be zero for tranche A. For the collateral, the cash flow in month 81 is \$3,318,521, consisting of a principal payment of \$2,032,196 and an interest payment of \$1,286,325. At the beginning of month 81 (end of month 80), the principal balance for tranche A is \$311,926. Therefore, \$311,926 of the \$2,032,196 of the principal payment from the collateral will be disbursed to tranche A. After this payment is made, no additional principal payments are made to this tranche, because the principal balance is zero. The remaining principal payment from the collateral, 1,720,271, is disbursed to tranche B. According to the assumed prepayment speed of 165 PSA, tranche B then begins receiving principal payments in month 81.

Table 30.4 shows that tranche B is fully paid off by month 100, which is when tranche C begins to receive principal payments. Tranche C is not fully paid off until month 178, at which time tranche D begins receiving the remaining principal payments. The maturity (i.e., the time until the principal is fully paid off) for these four tranches assuming 165 PSA would be 81 months for tranche A, 100 months for tranche B, 178 months for tranche C, and 357 months for tranche D.

Let's look at what has been accomplished by creating the CMO. First, as shown earlier in this chapter, the average life for the pass-through is 8.76 years, assuming a prepayment speed of 165 PSA. Table 30.5 reports the average life of the collateral and the four tranches, assuming different prepayment speeds. Notice that the four tranches have average lives that are both shorter and longer than the collateral, thereby attracting investors who have a preference for an average life different from that of the collateral.

A major problem remains: The average life for the tranches varies considerably. We see how this issue can be tackled later in this chapter. However, some protection is provided for each tranche against prepayment risk. Prioritizing the distribution of principal (i.e., establishing the payment rules for principal) effectively protects the shorter-term tranche A in this structure against extension risk. This protection must come from somewhere, so it comes from the three other tranches. Similarly, tranches C and D provide protection against extension risk for tranches A and B. At the same time, tranches C and D benefit, because they are provided protection against contraction risk, the protection coming from tranches A and B.

Accrual tranches In CMO-1, the payment rules for interest provide for all tranches to be paid interest each month. In many sequential-pay CMO structures, at least one tranche does not receive current interest. Instead, the interest for that tranche would accrue and be added to the principal balance. Such a bond class is commonly referred to as an accrual tranche, or a Z bond (because the bond is similar to a zero-coupon bond). The interest that would have been paid to the accrual bond class is then used to accelerate paying down the principal balance of earlier bond classes.

To see this process, consider CMO-2, a hypothetical CMO structure with the same collateral as CMO-1 and with four tranches, each with a coupon rate of  $7.5\%$ . The structure is shown in table 30.6. The difference is in the last tranche,  $Z$ , which is an accrual bond.

Table 30.6 CMO-2: Hypothetical four-tranche sequential-pay structure with an accrual bond class.

<table><tr><td>Tranche</td><td>Par Amount ($)</td><td>Coupon Rate (\%)</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>194,500,000</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>36,000,000</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>96,500,000</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>Z (Accrual)</td><td>73,000,000</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>400,000,000</td><td></td></tr></table>

Notes: Payment rules: 1. For payment of periodic coupon interest: Disburse periodic coupon interest to tranches A, B, and C based on the amount of principal outstanding at the beginning of the period. For tranche Z, accrue the interest based on the principal plus accrued interest in the previous period. The interest for tranche Z is to be paid to the earlier tranches as a principal paydown. 2. For disbursement of principal payments: Disburse principal payments to tranche A until it is completely paid off. After tranche A is completely paid off, disburse principal payments to tranche B until it is completely paid off. After tranche B is completely paid off, disburse principal payments to tranche C until it is completely paid off. After tranche C is completely paid off, disburse principal payments to tranche Z until the original principal balance plus accrued interest is completely paid off.

Let's look at month 1 and compare it to month 1 in table 30.4, based on 165 PSA. The principal payment from the collateral is 709,923. In CMO-1, this amount is the principal paydown for tranche A. In CMO-2, the interest for tranche Z,  \$456,250 (see table 30.4), is not paid to that tranche but instead is used to pay down the principal of tranche A. So the principal payment to tranche A is\$ 1,166,173, which is obtained from the collateral's principal payment of \$709,923 (see table 30.2) plus the interest of \$456,250 (see table 30.4) that was diverted from tranche Z.

The inclusion of the accrual tranche results in a shortening of the expected final maturity for tranches A, B, and C. It turns out that the final payout for tranche A is 64 months rather than 81 months, for tranche B it is 77 months rather than 100 months, and for tranche C it is 112 rather than 178 months.

The average lives for tranches A, B, and C are shorter in CMO-2 compared to CMO-1 because of the inclusion of the accrual bond. For example, at 165 PSA, the average lives (in years) are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Structure</td><td>Tranche A</td><td>Tranche B</td><td>Tranche C</td></tr><tr><td>CMO-2</td><td>2.90</td><td>5.86</td><td>7.87</td></tr><tr><td>CMO-1</td><td>3.48</td><td>7.49</td><td>11.19</td></tr></table>

The reason for the shortening of the nonaccrual tranches is that the interest that would be paid to the accrual bond is being allocated to the other tranches. Tranche Z in CMO-2 will have a longer average life than tranche D in CMO-1.

Thus, shorter-term tranches and a longer-term tranche are created by including an accrual bond. The accrual bond appeals to investors who are concerned with reinvestment risk. The lack of coupon payments that must be reinvested eliminates reinvestment risk until all the other tranches are paid off.

Planned amortization class tranches In the 1980s, many investors were still concerned about investing in an instrument they continued to perceive as posing significant prepayment risk because of the substantial average life variability, despite the innovations designed to reduce prepayment risk. Traditional corporate bond buyers sought a structure with both the characteristics of a corporate bond (either a bullet maturity or a sinking fund type of schedule for principal repayment) and high credit quality. Although CMOs satisfied the second condition, they did not satisfy the first.

In 1987, CMO issuers began issuing bonds with the characteristic that if prepayments are in a specified range, the cash flow pattern is known. The greater predictability of the cash flow for these classes of bonds, referred to as planned amortization class (PAC) bonds, occurs because of a principal repayment schedule that must be satisfied. PAC bond-holders take priority over all other classes in the CMO issue in receiving principal payments from the underlying collateral. The greater certainty of the cash flow for the PAC bonds comes at the expense of the non-PAC classes, called the support or companion bonds. These bonds absorb the prepayment risk. Because PAC bonds have protection against both extension risk and contraction risk, they are said to provide two-sided prepayment protection.

To illustrate how to create a PAC bond, we use as collateral the 400 million pass-through with a coupon rate of 7.5\%, a WAC of 8.125\%, and a WAM of 357 months. The second column of table 30.7 shows the principal payment (regularly scheduled principal repayment plus prepayments) for selected months assuming a prepayment speed of 90 PSA.

The last column of table 30.7 gives the minimum principal payment if the collateral speed is 90 PSA or 300 PSA for months 1 to 349. (After month 346, the outstanding principal balance will be paid off if the prepayment speed is between 90 PSA and 300 PSA.) For example, in the first month, the principal payment would be  \$508,169.52 if the collateral prepays at 90 PSA and\$ 1,075,931.20 if the collateral prepays at 300 PSA. Thus, the minimum principal payment is \$508,169.52, as reported in the last column of table 30.7. In month 103, the minimum principal payment is also the amount if the prepayment speed is 90 PSA, \$1,446,761, compared to \$1,458,618.04 for 300 PSA. In month 104, however, a prepayment speed of 300 PSA would produce a principal payment of \$1,433,539.23, which is less than the principal payment of \$1,440,825.55 assuming 90 PSA. So, \$1,433,539.23 is reported in the last column of table 30.7. In fact, from month 104 on, the minimum principal payment is the one that would result assuming a prepayment speed of 300 PSA.

In fact, if the collateral prepays at any speed between 90 PSA and 300 PSA, the minimum principal payment would be the amount reported in the last column of table 30.7. For example, if we had included principal payment figures assuming a prepayment speed of 200 PSA, the minimum principal payment would not change: from month 11 through month 103, the minimum principal payment is that generated from 90 PSA, but from month 104 on, the minimum principal payment is that generated from 300 PSA.

This characteristic of the collateral allows for the creation of a PAC bond, assuming that the collateral prepays over its life at a constant speed between 90 PSA and 300 PSA. A schedule is specified of principal repayments that the PAC bondholders are entitled to receive before any other bond class in the CMO. The monthly schedule of principal repayments is as specified in the last column of table 30.7, which shows the minimum principal payment. Although collateral prepayment between these two speeds cannot be guaranteed, a PAC bond can be structured to assume that it is.

Table 30.8 shows a CMO structure, CMO-3, created from the  \$400 million, 7.5\%$  coupon pass-through with a WAC of  $8.125\%$  and a WAM of 357 months.

Table 30.8 CMO-3 structure with one PAC bond and one support bond.

<table><tr><td>Tranche</td><td>Par Amount ($)</td><td>Coupon Rate (\%)</td></tr><tr><td>P (PAC)</td><td>243,800,000</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>S (Support)</td><td>156,200,000</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>400,000,000</td><td></td></tr></table>

Note: Payment rules: 1. For payment of periodic coupon interest: Disburse periodic coupon interest to each tranche based on the amount of principal outstanding at the beginning of the period. 2. For disbursement of principal payments: Disburse principal payments to tranche P based on its schedule of principal repayments. Tranche P has priority with respect to current and future principal payments to satisfy the schedule. Any excess principal payments in a month over the amount necessary to satisfy the schedule for tranche P are paid to tranche S. When tranche S is completely paid off, all principal payments are to be made to tranche P regardless of the schedule.

The two bond classes in this structure are a  $7.5\%$  coupon PAC bond created assuming 90 to 300 PSA with a par value of \$243.8 million, and a support bond with a par value of \$ 156.2 million.

Table 30.9 reports the average life for the PAC bond and the support bond in CMO-3, assuming various actual prepayment speeds. Notice that between 90 PSA and 300 PSA, the average life for the PAC bond is stable at 7.26 years. However, at slower or faster PSA speeds, the schedule is broken, and the average life changes, lengthening when the prepayment speed is less than 90 PSA and shortening when it is greater than 300 PSA. Even so, much greater variability characterizes the average life of the support bond, which is substantial.

Agency stripped mortgage-backed securities, introduced by Fannie Mae in 1986, are another example of derivative mortgage securities. A mortgage pass-through security divides the cash flow from the underlying pool of mortgages on a pro rata basis to the security holders. A stripped MBS is created by altering that distribution of principal and interest from a pro rata distribution to an unequal distribution. As a result, some of the securities created demonstrate a price/yield relationship different from that of the underlying mortgage pool. Stripped MBSs, if properly used, provide a means by which investors can hedge prepayment risk.

The first generation of stripped MBSs were partially stripped, and among them were securities issued by Fannie Mae in mid-1986. The Class B stripped MBSs were backed by Fannie Mae (FNMA) pass-through securities with a  $9\%$  coupon. The mortgage payments from the underlying mortgage pool were distributed to Class B-1 and Class B-2, so that both classes received an equal amount of the principal, but Class B-1 received one-third of the interest payments, whereas Class B-2 received two-thirds.

In a subsequent issue, Fannie Mae distributed the cash flow from the underlying mortgage pool in a far different way. Using Fannie Mae  $11\%$  coupon pools, Fannie Mae created Class A-1 and Class A-2. Class A-1 was given  $4.95\%$  of the  $11\%$  coupon interest, and Class A-2 received the other  $6.05\%$ . Class A-1 was given almost all the principal payments  $(99\%)$ , whereas Class A-2 was allotted only  $1\%$  of the principal payments.

In early 1987, stripped MBSs began to be issued that allocated all the interest to one class (called the interest-only or IO class) and all the principal to the other class (called the principal-only or PO class). The IO class receives no principal payments. IO and PO securities are also referred to as mortgage strips.

The PO security is purchased at a substantial discount from par value. The yield an investor realizes depends on the speed at which prepayments are made. The faster the prepayments are made, the higher the investor's yield will be. For example, suppose a mortgage pool consists of only 30-year mortgages, with  \$400 million in principal, and that investors can purchase POs backed by this mortgage pool for\$ 175 million. The dollar return on this investment will be  \$225 million. How quickly that dollar return is recovered by PO investors determines the yield realized. In the extreme case, if all home owners in the underlying mortgage pool decide to prepay their loans immediately, PO investors will realize the\$ 225 million immediately. At the other extreme, if all home owners decide to remain in their homes for 30 years and make no prepayments, the 225 million will be spread out over 30 years, which would result in a lower yield for PO investors.

The price of a PO security rises when interest rates decline, and it falls when interest rates rise. This price/interest relationship is typical of all the bonds discussed thus far in this book. A characteristic of a PO security is that its price is sensitive to changes in interest rates.

An IO security has no par value. In contrast to the PO investor, the IO investor wants prepayments to be slow, because the IO investor receives interest only on the amount of the principal outstanding. When prepayments are made, less dollar interest will be received as the outstanding principal declines. In fact, if prepayments are too fast, the IO investor may not recover the amount paid for the IO security. The unique aspect of an IO security is that its price changes in the same direction as the change in interest rates. Moreover, as in the case of the PO security, its price is highly responsive to a change in interest rates.

Because of these price volatility characteristics of stripped MBSs, institutional investors use them to control the risk of a portfolio of MBSs by creating a risk/return pattern that better fits their needs.

# Private-Label RMBSs

Private-label RMBSs (also referred to as "nonagency RMBSs") are RMBSs issued by entities other than Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Private-label RMBS are issued through the conduits of (1) commercial banks (e.g., Citigroup's CitiMortgage), (2) investment banking firms, and (3) entities not associated with either commercial banks or investment banking firms.

At one time, the private-label RMBS market was classified into two sectors, the prime sector and the subprime sector. The distinction was based on the type of borrowers in the pool of mortgage loans. As explained in chapter 29, mortgage loans can be classified as prime loans and subprime loans. The latter are loans made to borrowers with an impaired credit history or when the loan is not a first lien on the property. The convention in the RMBS market was to classify prime deals as private-label RMBSs but subprime deals as consumer loans, referred to as mortgage-related ABSs. Subprime deals include home equity loans and manufactured housing loans. After the meltdown of the subprime mortgage market in 2007, which we describe shortly, there has been little issuance of subprime deals, and the market tends not to distinguish between prime and subprime deals.

For agency mortgage-related securities described in the previous section, we noted that there are pass-through securities, CMOs, and stripped MBSs. Typically, the structure that is used for a private-label RMBS is the CMO structure. The creation of a private-label CMO is different from that of an agency CMO. When describing agency CMOs, we said that the process first involves pooling loans to create an agency pass-through security. Then a pool of agency pass-through securities is pooled to create an agency CMO. In a private-label CMO, the loans are pooled and used to create different bond classes (tranches).

Before 2007, deals could include all forms of credit enhancement described that we described chapter 27. When sizing the credit enhancement, subprime deals required considerably more credit enhancement than did prime deals. In retrospect, it has been argued that the collapse of the subprime mortgage market can be attributed to insufficient credit enhancement.

# Credit Enhancement

Unlike agency RMBSs, private-label CMOs are rated by one or more of the credit rating agencies. Because there is no government or GSE guarantee, to receive an investment-grade rating, these securities must be structured with additional credit support. The credit support is needed to absorb expected losses from the underlying loan pool due to defaults. As explained in chapter 27, this additional credit support is referred to as a credit enhancement. Credit enhancements come in different forms: (1) senior-subordinate structure, (2) excess spread, (3) overcollateralization, and (4) monoline insurance. We describe these forms briefly here. These same forms of credit enhancement are used by corporations in the creation of ABS structures to obtain funding, as covered in chapter 27.

When commercial rating agencies assign a rating to the tranches in a private-label CMO, they look at the credit risk associated with a tranche. Basically, that analysis begins by looking at the credit quality of the underlying pool of mortgage loans. For example, a pool of loans can consist of prime borrowers or subprime borrowers. Obviously, one would expect that a pool consisting of prime borrowers would have fewer expected losses as a percentage of the dollar amount of the loan pool compared to a pool consisting of subprime borrowers. Given the credit quality of the borrowers in the pool and other factors (such as the structure of the transaction), a rating agency will determine the dollar amount of the credit enhancement needed for a particular tranche to receive a specific credit rating. The process by which the rating agencies determine the amount of credit enhancement needed is referred to as "sizing the transaction."

There are standard mechanisms for providing credit enhancement in private-label CMOs. We describe these mechanisms below.

Senior-subordinate structure In a senior-subordinate structure, two general categories of branches are created: a senior tranche and subordinate tranches. For example, consider the following hypothetical private-label CMO structure consisting of 400 million of collateral:

Notice that there are seven tranches in this transaction. The tranche with the highest rating is referred to as the senior tranche. The subordinate tranches are those below the senior tranche.

<table><tr><td>Tranche</td><td>Principal Amount</td><td>Credit Rating</td></tr><tr><td>X1</td><td>\$350 million</td><td>AAA</td></tr><tr><td>X2</td><td>\$20 million</td><td>AA</td></tr><tr><td>X3</td><td>\$10 million</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>X4</td><td>\$5 million</td><td>BBB</td></tr><tr><td>X5</td><td>\$5 million</td><td>BB</td></tr><tr><td>X6</td><td>\$5 million</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>X7</td><td>5 million</td><td>Not rated</td></tr></table>

The rules for the distribution of the cash flow (interest and principal) among the tranches as well as how losses are to be distributed are explained in the prospectus. These rules are referred to as the deal's waterfall. Basically, the losses are distributed based on the tranche's position in the structure. Losses run from the bottom (the lowest or unrated tranche) to the senior tranche. For example, if over the life of this private-label CMO, the losses are less than  \$5 million, only tranche X7 will realize a loss. If the loss is, say,\$ 15 million, tranches X7, X6, and X5 will realize total losses and the other tranches no losses.

Note a few points about this structure. First, the credit enhancement for tranches is being provided by other tranches in the structure. For example, the senior tranche, X1, is being protected against losses up to \$50 million. This is because it is only when \$50 million of losses are realized that tranche X1 will realize a loss. Tranche X4 has credit enhancement of \$15 million, because the collateral can realize \$15 million in losses before tranche X4 realizes a loss.

Second, compare what is being done to distribute credit risk in this private-label CMO compared to an agency CMO. In an agency CMO, there is no credit risk. What is being done when creating the different tranches is the redistribution of prepayment risk. In contrast, in a private-label CMO, there is both credit risk and prepayment risk. By creating the senior-subordinate tranches, credit risk is being redistributed among the tranches in the structure. Hence, what is being done is credit tranching. Can prepayment risk also be redistributed? This is typically done in private-label CMOs but only at the senior tranche level. That is, the 350 million of senior tranches in our hypothetical private-label CMO structure can be carved up to create senior tranches with different exposures to prepayment risk.

Finally, when the tranches are sold in the market, they are sold at different yields. Obviously, the lower the credit rating of a tranche is, the higher is the yield at which it must be offered.

Excess spread Excess spread is basically the interest from the collateral that is not being used to satisfy the liabilities (i.e., the interest payments to the tranches in the structure) and the fees (such as mortgage servicing and administrative fees). The excess spread can be used to help offset any losses.

If the excess spread is retained in the structure rather than paid out, it can be accumulated in a reserve account and used to pay not only current losses experienced by the collateral but also future losses. Hence, excess spread is a form of credit enhancement. Because the loan rate on subprime loans is greater than that on prime loans and because the expected losses are greater for subprime loans, excess spread is an important source of credit enhancement for subprime RMBS.

Overcollateralization In our hypothetical nonagency CMO, the liabilities are  \$400 million and are assumed to match the amount of the collateral. Suppose instead that the collateral has a par value of\$ 405 million. In this case, the assets exceed the liabilities by 5 million. This excess collateral is referred to as overcollateralization and can be used to absorb losses. Hence, it is a form of credit enhancement.

Overcollateralization is more commonly used as a form of credit enhancement in subprime deals than in prime deals. This is one of the aspects that makes subprime deals more complicated, because a series of tests is built into the structure to determine when collateral can be released.

Monoline insurance In Chapter 8, we discussed life insurance and property and casualty insurance companies. Some insurance companies, by charter, provide only financial guarantees. These insurance companies are called monoline insurance companies. These companies provide the guaranty for insured municipal bonds in the United States. For RMBSs, they provide the same function, and therefore this is viewed as a form of credit enhancement.

# The Subprime Mortgage Crisis and Securitization

In the summer of 2007 the subprime mortgage market experienced a crisis, which led to a credit and liquidity crisis that had a ripple effect on other sectors of the credit and equity markets. This episode in the history of financial markets is referred to as the subprime mortgage crisis.

In keeping with the history of financial innovation bashing, there have been overreactions, misinformation, and widely differing viewpoints regarding this crisis. Some market observers saw it as the inevitable bursting of the "housing bubble" that had characterized the housing market in prior years. Others viewed it as the product of unsavory practices by mortgage lenders who deceived subprime borrowers into purchasing homes they could not afford. Moreover, specific mortgage designs, such as hybrid loans, which made it possible for a subprime borrower to obtain a loan, could have been expected to cause financial difficulties in the future when loan rates were adjusted upward as part of the loan agreement.

Of course, mortgage lenders blamed borrowers for misleading them. Others laid the blame at the feet of Wall Street bankers who packaged subprime loans into bonds and sold them to investors, citing the arguments described earlier in this chapter regarding the originate-to-distribute approach pursued by financial institutions.

Whatever the precise cause, it is hard to deny that securitization—the financial framework that allowed Wall Street to package these loans into MBSs—is of enormous benefit to the economy. Securitization has increased the supply of credit to homeowners and reduced the cost of borrowing. It also spreads the risk among a larger pool of investors rather than concentrating it in a small group of banks and thrifts, and it makes credit available to a wider group of borrowers. Critics of securitization argue that such borrowers may not be suitable candidates for loans. These critics claim that the only reason a lender would make such loans is because it does not hold the loans on its balance sheet; instead, it sells them in the market, either to a conduit that will securitize the loans or by securitizing them itself.

Although it can be argued that not all those who were shut out from the market prior to securitization were in fact weak borrowers, the empirical evidence discussed earlier about the underwriting practice associated with the securitization of subprime loans appears to support the position that standards may have been lax. However, that is an attack on underwriting standards for the mortgage sector and not a reason for attacking securitization in general. As we stated earlier in this chapter, securitization is an important and legitimate way for the financial markets to function more efficiently today than in the past. It is not a smoke-and-mirrors financial structure that fraudulent companies have used to hide the true nature of their operations. Although sometimes complex, real securitization generally takes place in regulated debt markets and with the participation of sophisticated parties—such as underwriters, loan servicers, institutional investors, rating agencies, and monoline insurance companies—that provide financial guarantees. Each of these entities has a unique role to play that helps produce a balanced—but not a riskless—result.

Credit rating agencies (CRAs) were also viewed by some market observers as having contributed in a major way to the crisis. To aid investors when comparing the relative credit risk of securities, issuers generally ask one or more CRAs to assign a credit rating to the securitization. Although no one, not even the rating agencies, can always accurately predict the performance of a bond over time, the agencies' long-term track record is solid. As explained in chapter 5 credit ratings are opinions about future performance. CRAs are not asset managers. They provide an initial screening for asset managers to help determine which bond classes might be suitable candidates for further credit analysis. Credit ratings are not a substitute for the due diligence that should be exercised by investors who claim to be experts on fixed-income securities.

What is surprising to many is why the crisis occurred in July 2007. There was no new information in the market at the time. Investors knew well before that time all about the potential defaults. Moreover, since 2005, the CRAs had taken actions that were transparent to the market. Specifically, the CRAs adjusted their criteria and assumptions regarding how they were rating subprime RMBS transactions, they downgraded some issues, and they publicly commented on their concerns about the subprime sector.

The impact of the subprime mortgage crisis on the financial markets was devastating. But the suggestion that securitization caused the subsequent global financial crisis would be wrong. In a speech by Robert Steel, then undersecretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, before the American Securitization Forum on February 5, 2008, Steel stated:

The securitization market is an example of how this incredible pace of innovation has changed financial markets. Secretary Paulson and I have been very clear—we believe that the benefits of securitization are significant. It enables investors to improve their risk management, achieve better risk adjusted returns and access more liquidity.

- The residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) market is divided into two sectors, agency MBS and private-label MBS.
- MBSs issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are included in the agency MBS sector.
- The loans used as collateral in agency MBSs are conforming loans.
- Agency MBSs include pass-through securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (CDOs), and stripped MBSs.
- To project the cash flow of a pool of mortgages, it is necessary to make some assumption about the prepayment rate over the life of the mortgage pool.
- The conditional prepayment rate (CPR) assumes that some fraction of the remaining principal in the pool is prepaid each year for the remaining term of the mortgage.
- A prepayment model is estimated based on the characteristics of the pool (including its historical prepayment experience) and the current and expected future economic environment.
- To estimate monthly prepayments, the CPR (an annual rate) must be converted into a monthly prepayment rate, commonly referred to as the single-monthly mortality rate (SMM).
- The Public Securities Association (PSA) prepayment benchmark is a monthly series of CPRs that assumes that prepayment rates are low for newly originated mortgages and then speed up as the mortgages become seasoned; slower or faster speeds are then referred to as some percentage of the PSA benchmark.
- The average life of an MBS is the average time to receipt of principal payments (scheduled principal payments and projected prepayments) weighted by the amount of principal expected.
- A mortgage pass-through security is created when one or more holders of loans form a collection (pool) of loans and sell shares or participation certificates in the pool.
- Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are created from pass-through securities to address the prepayment risks associated with investing in pass-through securities: contraction risk and extension risk.
- A CMO sets forth rules for the distribution of interest and principal repayment to the different bond classes in the structure.
- CMO tranches are created to meet the different needs of institutional investors.
- Agency CMOs are an example of time tranching.
- Like a CMO, a stripped MBS is created from a pass-through security.
- The purpose of creating a stripped MBS is to provide an instrument that can be used to control the risk of a portfolio of mortgage-related securities.
- The private-label RMBS market was at one time classified into prime RMBS and subprime RMBS sectors, according to the credit quality of the borrowers.
- Subprime RMBS structures are more complicated and require more credit enhancement than prime RMBS structures.
- The subprime mortgage meltdown began in the summer of 2007 and has been attributed to the collapse of the subprime housing finance market
