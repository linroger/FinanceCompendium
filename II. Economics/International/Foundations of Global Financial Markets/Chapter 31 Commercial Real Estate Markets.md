The real estate market includes residential properties and commercial properties. Residential real estate includes one- to four-family properties and is the subject of chapter 30. Commercial real estate is income-producing properties. The major commercial property types are multifamily housing, apartment buildings, office buildings, industrial properties (including warehouses), shopping centers, hotels, health care facilities (e.g., senior housing care facilities), and timberlands. In this chapter, we discuss the commercial real estate market.

## Categories of the Commercial Real Estate Market

Prior to the introduction of the securitization of real estate-related equity and debt, real estate was defined to include only investments in private commercial real estate equity and private commercial real estate debt. Insurance companies traditionally constructed portfolios composed of individual private real estate mortgages. Pension funds and wealthy families held direct investments in individual buildings and in commingled funds. Given the absence of a secondary market for real estate debt and equity, investors followed a buy-to-hold strategy.

With the advent of securitization in the 1960s, the definition of commercial real estate investments has broadened. Today commercial real estate investments include the following four categories:

1. private commercial real estate equity,
2. public commercial real estate equity,
3. private commercial real estate debt, and
4. public commercial real estate debt.

Regardless of what category a commercial real estate investment falls into, its return is responsive to a common set of factors. But there are unique factors that impact real estate investments for specific categories. Thus, the rationale for broadening the definition of real estate investment beyond its historical definition of private debt and equity is that the factors driving real estate returns for the two private categories are reflected, to a greater or lesser degree, in the returns for the two public categories.

Investors are often explicitly or implicitly invested in all four categories, and therefore are exposed to real estate behaviors in each category. Consequently, when examining the reasons for commercial real estate investing, we should consider the categories rather than accepting the traditional reasons for the role of commercial real estate. These traditional reasons were historically based only on the private equity and ignore not only the other three categories available to investors but also the factors that affect returns.

## Primary Reasons Offered for Investing in Commercial Real Estate

The five primary reasons that have been offered for considering commercial real estate as part of a portfolio are to:

1. reduce portfolio risk by combining asset classes that respond in different ways to expected and unexpected events.
2. generate absolute returns that well exceed the risk-free rate.
3. hedge against unexpected inflation or deflation.
4. build a part of a portfolio that is a reasonable reflection of the overall investment universe.
5. generate strong cash flows to the portfolio.2

Several studies have attempted to determine whether these reasons offered for investing in real estate can be supported empirically. Investigating these alleged reasons empirically has been difficult. Even what is a simple part of the empirical investigation—calculating market returns for equities and fixed income securities—is controversial in the real estate market. Moreover, research has to examine each of the four quadrants rather than treat real estate as one asset class.

Below we summarize some of the studies dealing with the alleged primary reasons for investment in real estate.

# Portfolio Diversifier and Risk Reducer

Several studies find that the correlations between real estate and stocks, real estate and bonds, and real estate and cash suggest that real estate can play a significant role in a mixed-asset portfolio.4 Recall the underlying principle of portfolio diversification and risk reduction as set forth by Markowitz and explained in chapter 13. When two imperfectly related assets (i.e., having a correlation coefficient less than 1.0) are included in a portfolio, there is an opportunity to construct a portfolio that has a higher expected return at each level of risk, or equivalently, to reduce risk for a given level of expected return. The risk is the portfolio's standard deviation. When the expected return to an asset class is high enough, or the risk is low enough, or the correlation of returns reflects a sufficiently different pattern of returns, an allocation should be made to that asset class in the portfolio for at least a portion of the return-risk spectrum. Commercial real estate satisfies these requirements; therefore, some allocation should be made to it in a well-diversified mixed-asset portfolio.

# Absolute Returns or Risk-Adjusted Returns

The second reason for investing in commercial real estate is that this asset class can potentially generate high absolute returns or risk-adjusted returns to a portfolio. One study reports that, on average, real estate did not outperform stocks and bonds in absolute terms from 1987 to 2004.[5] However, in terms of total return per unit of risk, real estate outperformed both stocks and bonds. Moreover, the study finds that real estate outperforms both stocks and bonds on a risk-adjusted basis using the Sharpe ratio, a reward-risk ratio described in chapter 13.

The same study also offers evidence that provides justification for including real estate in a portfolio from the perspective of risk-adjusted returns. However, the authors of the study argue that it is not immediately justifiable to include real estate for the sole reason of bringing high absolute returns to the portfolio, because real estate is not reliable as a producer of the highest absolute returns.

# Inflation Hedge

Real estate is considered by some observers to be an inflation hedge for the following reason: If the inflation rate exceeds the expected inflation rate, then the returns on real estate will compensate for the surprise, helping offset the negative response to excess inflation of other assets in the portfolio. The question is whether this reason can be empirically supported.

Let's begin with the relationship of real estate returns. The relationship is a complicated one, because the response to inflation differs for the four major property types (i.e., offices, warehouses, retail, and apartments). A return is composed of an income and price change component. Inflation impacts the income and value components of the return in a different way for each property type.

After discussing the impact on different property types and reviewing the empirical evidence, one study concludes that although private equity real estate is a very useful partial inflation hedge, the degree of inflation-hedging capacity is not uniform across property types. For publicly traded forms of equity real estate, some benefits of the inflation hedge will be captured but are less successful transmitters of this value than is private equity. The reason is that the links to the stock market, which is generally adversely impacted by inflation, are less successful in transmitting this value. However, recent findings suggest that the returns on real estate investment trusts (REITs) have become less highly correlated with stock market returns, which could result in better inflation hedging by REITs.

Not surprisingly, the study does not find that the inflation-hedging reason for investing in real estate applies to the two debt quadrants. As is the case with most debt, real estate debt is not a good inflation hedge, because unexpected inflation and concomitant increases in nominal interest rates negatively impact the value of outstanding fixed-income securities (mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs)).

# Reasonable Reflection of the Investment Universe

It is argued that real estate belongs in a balanced investment portfolio, because this asset class is an important part of the investment universe. The omission of real estate from a portfolio is fundamentally an investor's view that real estate will perform less well than is implied by the market-driven relative prices. Even if some allocation is made to real estate, capital market theory suggests that any allocation that is less than real estate's overall share in the investment universe implies a different view by the investor from that of an indexed portfolio. Consequently, any underallocation to real estate must be justified.

# Strong Cash Flows

Investor needs vary for regular distributions of cash. Investors whose objective is the maximization of total return relative to a benchmark return find the need for strong cash flows to be less important than do investors who need cash to satisfy current and near-term liabilities. For the latter investors, the appeal of an asset class that exhibits strong cash flows is important. The question is whether real estate fits the bill.

One study analyzes the relative income returns on real estate and compares them with those of bonds and stocks. This study finds that real estate is a far superior producer of steady income for investors. For investors who seek to earn a higher proportion of their total portfolio return in the form of realized income rather than unrealized capital appreciation, real estate offers a far greater chance of accomplishing this. This conclusion applies to all four categories of real estate in terms of better production of cash flows compared to stocks and bonds.

# Private Commercial Real Estate Equity

Private commercial real estate equity is held by investors as individual assets or in commingled vehicles. Individual investors can invest in private commercial real estate equity via different investment vehicles. Historically, efforts were made to design structures to allow individuals to participate in the private real estate market. The most notable attempt is the limited partnership syndications of the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, in the United States, these design structures were short lived, because the tax benefits were typically dependent on certain tax advantages. When the tax law that allowed for such tax advantages was eliminated with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, these tax-oriented design structures disappeared.

The usual way that individual investors have obtained exposure to commercial property has been through their pension plans. As explained in chapter 3, in the United States there are two types of pension plans: defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. The former plans have had sizeable allocations to real estate.

The difficulties with the collective investment vehicles that can be used by individual investors to obtain exposure to private equity real estate are twofold: the daily pricing of the portfolio holdings of real estate properties and the liquidity requirement for defined contribution plans. Dealing with the liquidity problem is addressed by the asset manager of the fund by allocating more to cash than would be allocated in a traditional real estate portfolio or a REIT. The major obstacle is the daily pricing in an industry where pricing is typically done on a quarterly basis. The approaches that have been suggested to deal with this difficulty include one or a combination of the following: (1) rotating the appraisal of portfolio properties throughout the quarter, (2) using a mark-to-model approach on a daily basis between appraisals for each property, and (3) using regular quarterly appraisals but also monitoring and revaluing properties any time an event of economic significance occurs. Esrig, Kolasa, and Cerreta discuss how target date funds can better satisfy the daily pricing and liquidity needs of investors than can other types of private equity real estate.

Two more ways for individual investors to participate in the private commercial real estate market are via private REITs and crowdfunding real estate projects. In the United States, the shares of private REITs are not traded on an exchange; nor are they registered with the SEC. Instead, they are issued under one or more of several exemptions to the securities laws. More specifically, private REITs are issued under two rules set forth under Regulation D. The first rule allows an issuer to sell securities to "accredited investors," and the second (Rule 144A) exempts securities issued to qualified institutional buyers. With respect to crowdfunding (discussed in chapter 28), using one of various online crowdfunding platforms, individual investors can search for potential real estate investments. The funds from individual investors are then pooled to finance that real estate project. Effectively, individuals participating in a real estate project are limited partners. In 2014, it is estimated that 1 billion was raised via real estate crowdfunding.[8]

## Commercial Property Indexes

With the increased interest in commercial real estate as an institutional asset class came the development of commercial property indexes. Most countries have property indexes. There are numerous commercial property indexes, but we discuss only a few of the major ones here.

For the United States, the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries produces a family of property indexes (NPIs) that includes, in addition to the national index, indexes for five property types (apartment, industrial, office, retail, and hotel), as well as for four main regions of the country. Appraised values are used to construct the NPI. Three types of return indexes are created for each index: (1) total return; (2) income return; and (3) capital appreciation return.

The Investment Property Databank (IPD) provides information about commercial real estate in the United Kingdom and worldwide. Now a member of the MSCI group, the IPD family of indexes includes the prices of the properties based on appraised values. The IPD UK index, for example, is based on about 21,175 properties held by U.K. institutions, trusts, partnerships and listed property companies.

The NPI and IPD indexes are calculated based on appraised values, but the Moody's/Real Capital Analytics Commercial Property Price Indices are based on real estate transactions that measure property prices at a national level for U.S. apartment, retail, office, and industrial properties. There are indexes for the main properties types and for select metropolitan statistical areas.

## Public Commercial Real Estate Equity

Public commercial real estate equity is structured as REITs or as real estate operating companies (REOCs). REITs can invest in both equity and debt, the former being a form of public real estate equity. We describe REITs in more detail in chapter 32, which covers collective investment vehicles.

Both REITs and REOCs invest in real estate and issue shares to the public that are traded on an exchange. However, there are two differences between a REOC and a REIT. First, a REOC is afforded more flexibility than a REIT as to the types of real estate investments in which they may invest. Second, a REOC reinvests its earnings in the company rather than distributing earnings to shareholders as a REIT does.

Equity REITs can be classified as diversified REITs, sector REITs, and specialty REITs. As the name suggests, a diversified REIT invests in a mix of property types. Sector REITs are restricted to holdings of specific major sectors of the real estate market, such as office REITs, industrial REITs, retail REITs, lodging REITs, residential REITs, health care REITs, self-storage REITs, and timberland REITs. Specialty REITs invest in a unique mix of property types that are not included in the major REIT sectors, such gas stations, golf courses, race tracks, and movie theaters.

Many developed and developing countries have legislation allowing for the creation of a REIT. Here are a few examples:

- United Kingdom. Prior to 2006, in the United Kingdom the vehicle by which investors obtained exposure to commercial real estate market was via listed property companies. The Finance Act of 2006 (effective January 2007) allowed for the creation of REITs in the United Kingdom, requiring that they be set up as investment trusts listed on a stock exchange approved by the U.K. Financial Services Authority. As in the United States, U.K. REITs are required to distribute  $90\%$  of their income to investors. Because there were tax advantages to investors available from REITs that were not available from listed property companies, nine major listed property companies that were members of the major U.K. equity market index, the FTSE 100, converted to REITs. To provide investors with greater transparency and information about U.K. REITs, "Reita" was created by the Quoted Property Group, set up by several commercial property and financial services companies.
- Germany. Germany is the largest European real estate market, split almost evenly between commercial and residential properties. Given the large size of the real estate market, the development of an investment vehicle, such as a REIT, was critical. In 2007, the law allowing REITs was approved by the Ministry of Finance, with the first REIT being the altria Office REIT-AG in April 2007. German REITs also have the  $90\%$  distribution rule and the requirement of the stock being traded on an exchange.
- Japan. Legislation allowing for the creation of REITs was passed in 2001. Japanese REITs are traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Japan's first two REITs, both listed in 2001, were the Nippon Building Fund Inc. and the Japan Real Estate Investment Corporation. The Japanese REIT market was initially dominated by office properties. In recent years, REITs have diversified and include a wider range of properties from the major sectors.

- Singapore. Regulated as a collective investment vehicle under the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Code on Collective Investment or as a business trusts, the REIT was set up in July 2002. REITs in Singapore can invest in a wide range of property sectors in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia, and Hong Kong. Distribution of at least  $90\%$  of its annual income is required. The appealing tax benefit of REITs in Singapore is not being taxed twice: income is taxed only at the investor level and not at the REITs level.
- Brazil. Referred to in Brazil as Fundos de Investimento Imobiliário, REITs in Brazil were first introduced via legislation in 1993. In 2006, the dividends paid by these REITs have been free of taxes for individual investors (not companies), provided the fund has at least 50 investors and is publicly traded on a stock market.

In countries with REITs, indexes have been developed to evaluate their performance. For example, in the United States, the most popular REIT indexes are the MSCI US REIT index, the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index. Three indexes are based on German REITs that have been developed by the Deutsche Borse (Germany's major stock exchange): RX REIT All Share Index, which includes all German REITs listed on the Prime Standard and the General Standard; the RX Real Estate Index, which contains up to 30 REITs and real estate companies from the General Standard; and the RX REIT Index, which contains up to 20 of the largest and most liquid REITs from Prime Standard. (The "Prime Standard" is the group of stocks on the Frankfort Stock Exchange that lists those German companies that comply with international transparency standards.)

The FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Index Series covers global, developed and emerging indexes, as well the United Kingdom's AIM market.

A family of indexes produced jointly by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA), the FTSE, and the National Association of Real Estate Trusts (NAREIT) for the global listed sector is available. The index series covers global (with and without the United Kingdom and the United States), regional (Europe, the Eurozone, and Asia Pacific with and without Japan), developed (the Americas), and emerging real estate equities markets.

Another way for investors to invest in public equity commercial real estate is via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a collective investment vehicle described in chapter 32. Three examples are the Vanguard REIT Index ETF, iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate, and Schwab U.S. REIT ETF. The Vanguard REIT Index ETF which tracks the MSCI US REIT index, invests in equity REITs with a bias towards large ETFs. As of April 30, 2016, this ETF had a position in 150 REITs, with a quarter of the portfolio's holdings being in the retail REIT sector. As the name indicates, iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate has as its benchmark the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index, whereas the Schwab U.S. REIT ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index.

## Public Nontraded REITs

The most popular type of REIT is publicly traded on an exchange and falls into the quadrant of public commercial real estate equity. However, there are public nontraded REITs structured in the same way as traditional REITs (and subject to the same investment and payout constraints) but not traded on a public exchange, with the investment generally tied up for 7 to 10 years until a liquidity event (e.g., sale or listing) allows return of any proceeds to investors. Nontraded REITs, typically marketed to "mom and pop" investors, are part of the private commercial real estate equity available to individuals. According to the Investment Program Association, from 2000 to 2014, nontraded REITs raised \$124 billion of capital, including \$21.1 billion in 2014 alone. The sponsors of nontraded REITs have been criticized for the high fees and sometimes misleading statements by brokers who aggressively sell this investment vehicle. The U.S. SEC identifies the following issues associated with investing in nontraded REITs:

- Lack of liquidity. Nontraded REITs are illiquid investments, which mean that they cannot be sold readily in the market. Instead, investors generally must wait until the non-traded REIT lists its shares on an exchange or liquidates its assets to achieve liquidity. These liquidity events, however, might not occur until more than 10 years after your investment.
- Nontraded REITs usually offer investors' opportunities to redeem their shares early but these share redemption programs are typically subject to significant limitations and may be discontinued at the discretion of the REIT without notice. Redemption programs also may require that shares be redeemed at a discount, meaning investors lose part of their investment if they redeem their shares.
- High fees. Nontraded REITs typically charge high upfront fees to compensate a firm or individual selling the investment and to lower their offering and organizational costs…. In addition to the high upfront fees, nontraded REITs may have significant transaction costs, such as property acquisition fees and asset management fees.
- Distributions may come from principal. Investors may be attracted to nontraded REITs by their high distributions, which may be referred to as dividend yields, compared to other investment options, including publicly traded REITs. However, the initial distributions may not represent earnings from operations since nontraded REITs often declare these distributions prior to acquiring significant assets….
- Lack of share value transparency. Because nontraded REITs are not publicly traded, there is no market price readily available. Consequently, it can be difficult to determine the value of a share of a nontraded REIT or the performance of your investment. In addition, any share valuation will be based on periodic or annual appraisals of the properties owned by the nontraded REIT, and therefore may not be accurate or timely.[9]

Private commercial real estate debt is held as directly issued commercial mortgages held in funds, commingled vehicles or whole loans (i.e., a single commercial mortgage that has not been securitized), or both. Commercial mortgage loans are mortgage loans for income-producing properties. A commercial mortgage loan is originated either to finance a commercial purchase or to refinance a prior mortgage obligation. The whole loan market, which is largely dominated by insurance companies and banks, is focused on loans between  \$10 and\$ 50 million issued on traditional property types (multifamily, retail, office, and industrial).

A commercial mortgage loan exposes the lender to credit risk. For commercial mortgage loans, the lender relies on the ability of the borrower to repay and has no recourse from the borrower if the payment terms are not satisfied. That is, commercial mortgage loans are nonrecourse loans. As a result, the lender can look only to the income-producing property backing the loan for interest and principal repayment. Because of the credit risk, lenders rely on various measures to assess the credit risk. The two most commonly used measures of potential credit risk are the debt-to-service coverage ratio and the loan-to-value ratio.

The debt-to-service coverage ratio (DSCR) measures the ability of the property to generate income to service the loan's obligations relative to the amount of the debt service required. More specifically, this ratio is equal to a property's net operating income (NOI) divided by the debt service. The NOI is equal to the projected rental income reduced by cash operating expenses (adjusted for a replacement reserve). A DSCR that exceeds 1 means that the NOI is sufficient to cover the debt servicing required by the loan. The higher the DSCR, the more likely it is that the borrower will be able to meet debt servicing from the property's cash flow.

As with residential mortgage loans described in chapter 29, the loan-to-value ratio (LTV ratio) is a measure of the amount of the loan to the value of the property being financed by the loan. For residential mortgage loans, "value" is either market value or appraised value. For commercial properties, the value of the property is based on the fundamental principles of valuation that we have mentioned throughout this book. The value of an asset is the present value of its expected cash flow. Valuation requires projecting an asset's cash flow and discounting at an appropriate interest rate. For valuing commercial property, the cash flow is the future NOI. A discount rate (a single rate), referred to as the "capitalization rate" and reflecting the risks associated with the cash flow, is then used to compute the present value of the future NOI. Consequently, considerable variation in the estimates of NOI and the appropriate capitalization rate can occur when estimating a property's market value. Thus, investors are often skeptical about estimates of market value and the resulting LTV ratios reported for properties.

For residential mortgage loans, only prepayment penalty mortgages provide some protection for the lender against prepayments. For commercial mortgage loans, call protection can take the following forms: a prepayment lockout, prepayment penalty points, yield maintenance charges, and defeasance.

A prepayment lockout is a contractual agreement that prohibits any prepayments during a specified time, called the lockout period. The lockout period can be from two to 10 years. After the lockout period, call protection usually comes in the form of either prepayment penalty points or yield maintenance charges.

Prepayment penalty points are predetermined penalties that must be paid by the borrower if the borrower wishes to refinance. For example, 5–4–3–2–1 is a common prepayment penalty point structure. That is, if the borrower wishes to prepay during the first year, the borrower must pay a  $5\%$  penalty; in the second year, a  $4\%$  penalty would apply, and so on.

A yield maintenance charge is designed to make the lender indifferent as to the timing of prepayments. The yield maintenance charge, also called the "make-whole charge," makes it uneconomical to refinance solely to get a lower mortgage rate. The simplest and most restrictive form of yield maintenance charge ("Treasury flat yield maintenance") penalizes the borrower based on the difference between the mortgage coupon and the prevailing Treasury rate.

With defeasance, the borrower provides sufficient funds for the servicer to invest in a portfolio of Treasury securities that replicates the cash flows that would exist in the absence of prepayments.

Another feature of commercial mortgage loans is that they are typically balloon loans, requiring substantial principal payment at the end of the loan's term. If the borrower fails to make the balloon payment, the borrower is in default. The lender may extend the loan and in so doing will typically modify the original loan terms. During the workout period for the loan, a higher interest rate will be charged—the default interest rate. The risk that a borrower will not be able to make the balloon payment because the borrower either cannot arrange for refinancing at the balloon payment date or cannot sell the property to generate sufficient funds to pay off the balloon balance is called balloon risk. Because the term of the loan will be extended by the lender during the workout period, balloon risk is also referred to as extension risk.

## Public Commercial Real Estate Debt

Public commercial real estate debt includes such structures as CMBSs and REITs that invest in mortgage debt. The latter are discussed in chapter 32, where we explain that REITs that invest in mortgage debt constitute a small part of the REIT market. Below we describe CMBSs.

In discussions about the CMBS market, participants distinguish between the types of CMBSs issued (i.e., the structure of the transactions, as described below). The pre-global financial crisis is referred to as "CMBS 1.0" and the years to follow as "CMBS 2.0."

## Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

Many types of commercial loans can be sold by the loan's originator as a commercial whole loan or structured into a CMBS transaction. A CMBS is a security backed by one or more commercial mortgage loans described earlier in this chapter. In CMBSs, loans of virtually any size (from as small as \$1 million to single property transactions as large as \$200 million) can be securitized.

In the United States, CMBSs, like residential MBSs described in chapter 30, can be issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and private entities. All securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are consistent with their mission of providing funding for residential housing. This includes securities backed by nursing home projects and health care facilities. Securities issued by Ginnie Mae are backed by the FHA—that is, they are insured multifamily housing loans. These loans are called project loans. From these loans, Ginnie Mae creates project loan pass-through securities. The securities can be backed by a single project loan on a completed project or by multiple project loans. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae purchase multifamily housing loans from approved lenders and either retain them in their portfolio or use them for collateral for a security. This is no different from what these two entities do with the single-family housing mortgage loans that they acquire. Although securities backed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mac, and Freddie Mac constitute the largest sector of the RMBS market, it is the securities issued by private entities that constitute by far the largest sector of the CMBS market.

CMBSs are backed by either newly originated or seasoned commercial mortgage loans. Most CMBSs are backed by newly originated loans. CMBSs can be classified by the type of loan pool. The first type of CMBS consists of loans backed by a single borrower. Usually such CMBSs are backed by large properties, such as regional malls or office buildings. The investors in this type of CMBS are insurance companies. The second type of CMBS consists of those backed by loans to multiple borrowers. This is the most common type of CMBS and is backed by a variety of property types. The most prevalent form of deal backed by commercial mortgage loans to multiple borrowers is the conduit deal. These deals are created by investment banking firms that establish a conduit arrangement with mortgage bankers to originate commercial mortgage loans specifically for the purpose of securitizing them (i.e., of creating CMBSs). The mortgage bankers originate and underwrite loans using the capital provided by the investment banking firm. There are multiple-borrower CMBS deals that combine loans that are included in conduit deals with a large or "mega" loan. These CMBS deals are called fusion deals or hybrid deals. Fusion deals dominate the U.S. CMBS market and are an important but not dominant sector outside the United States.

In Europe, one of the consequences of the global financial crisis has been the simplification of the transactions by only including a single large commercial loan rather than multiple commercial loans of varying size. An example of a single large loan backing a CMBS is the £263 million issued in July 2013 backed by the retail stores of Toys R Us, a privately owned retailer. (This company declared bankruptcy in September 2017.) The problem in Europe is that a single large loan CMBS is not sustainable, given that there may not be enough issuers of sufficient size to back a CMBS.

## CMBS Structure

We explained in chapter 30 how private-label RMBS transactions are structured to redistribute credit risk. The structure of a CMBS deal is much the same. Different bond classes or tranches are created, and waterfall rules are in place for the distribution of interest, principal, and losses. The structure of a CMBS transaction is the same as for a private-label RMBS in that most structures have multiple bond classes (branches) with different ratings, and rules exist for the distribution of interest and principal to the bond classes. However, three major differences arise from the features of the underlying loans.[10]

First, as explained earlier when discussing private commercial real estate debt, prepayment terms for commercial mortgages differ significantly from those for residential mortgages. The former imposes prepayment penalties or restrictions on prepayments. Although some residential mortgages have prepayment penalties, they make up a small fraction of the market. When structuring a CMBS, there are rules for the allocation of any prepayment penalties among the bondholders. In addition, if defeasance occurs, the credit risk of a CMBS virtually disappears, because it is then backed by U.S. Treasury securities.

The second difference in structuring stems from the significant difference between commercial and residential mortgages with respect to the role of the servicer when a default occurs. With commercial mortgages, the loan can be transferred by the servicer to the "special servicer" when the borrower is in default, in imminent default, or in violation of covenants. The key here is that the loan can be transferred when a default is imminent. The special servicer has the responsibility of modifying the loan terms in the case of an imminent default to reduce the likelihood of default. There is no equivalent feature for a residential mortgage in the case of an imminent default. The particular choice of action that may be taken by the special servicer in a commercial mortgage will generally have different effects on the various bond classes in a CMBS structure. Moreover, a default can occur as a result of failure to make the balloon payment at the end of the loan term, and different loans may have different mechanisms for dealing with such a default. Thus, balloon risk must be taken into account when structuring a CMBS transaction, because the significant size of the balloon payment can have a considerable impact on the cash flow of the structure. Balloon risk is not something that has to be dealt with when structuring an RMBS.

The third difference in structuring between CMBSs and RMBSs has to do with the role of the buyers when the structure is being created. Specifically, for a CMBS, typically potential buyers of the junior bond classes are first sought by the issuer before the deal is structured. The potential buyers review the proposed pool of mortgage loans and in the review process, depending on market demand for CMBS products, may request the removal of some loans from the pool. This phase in the structuring process, which one does not find in RMBS transactions, provides an additional layer of security for the senior buyers, particularly because some of the buyers of the junior classes have tended to be knowledgeable real estate investors.

## Illustration of a CMBS Deal

In chapter 30, we discussed how an agency CMO and a private-label CMO are created. The structure of a CMBS deal is much the same. There are different bond classes or tranches, and there are rules for the distribution of interest, principal, and losses.

Table 31.1 shows the bond classes of a CMBS deal, Banc of America Commercial Mortgage Trust 2006-1. Only the bond classes offered to the public are identified. The credit rating for each bond class is shown. For the bond classes offered, the senior certificates in this CMBS deal are Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3A, Class A-3B, Class A-4, Class A-1A, and Class XP Certificates. The junior certificates are Class A-M, Class A-J, Class B, Class C, and Class D. The subordination (credit support), priority of payment, and order of loss allocation as set forth in the prospectus supplement are reproduced in figure 31.1.

The mortgage pool consists of 192 loans. A loan may be for more than one property. The offering documents for the bond classes will disclose the number of mortgage properties by type, as well as the 10 largest loans in the mortgage pool with their LTV ratio and debt-to-service ratio at the time of issuance.

## How CMBSs Trade in the Market

One might think that because CMBSs and RMBSs are backed by mortgage loans, they would trade in a similar manner in the marketplace. That is not the case. The primary reason has to do with the greater prepayment protection given to investors in CMBSs compared to RMBSs. We described that protection at the loan level. At the structure level (i.e., when the commercial mortgage loans are pooled to create a CMBS), certain bond classes can be created that give even greater prepayment protection. We described how this is done for certain RMBS tranches in collateralized mortgage obligations. As a result, CMBSs trade much like corporate bonds than RMBS.

## Investors in the Commercial Real Estate Market

The 1980s witnessed increased interest in commercial real estate as an asset class by institutional investors. However, the difficulties arising from the crash of property values in the early 1990s led to a massive retreat by institutional investors from this asset class. It took many years to persuade institutional investors that real estate would not fall apart in every recession. With any class asset, there are two components to returns: a cyclical component and a secular component. It was the downturn in the market—a cyclical component—that scared off institutional investors, resulting in a decline in the allocation to commercial real estate.

Even following the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, institutional investors have not abandoned the asset class due to the acceptance of several of the reasons for investing in commercial real estate discussed earlier in this chapter. In fact, because of the low interest rate environment pursued by governments throughout the world, commercial real estate has become more attractive as a source of relatively steady returns. According to the 2015 investor report by the Pension Real Estate Association, as of year-end 2014, the average allocation to real estate by institutional investors was  $8.4\%$  of total assets, representing a slight increase from 2013. The Pension Real Estate Association report notes that allocations substantially higher than the  $8.4\%$  are not uncommon for some institutional investors.

Commercial real estate falls into the alternative asset class, along with hedge funds and private equity. According to Towers Watson in its "Global Alternatives Survey 2015," for the top 100 asset managers of alternative assets, real estate constitutes one-third of the total assets under management, making it the largest component of the alternative asset class. Consequently, real estate has now become the "mainstream alternative" alternative asset class.

It has been argued that the pattern of institutional investor commitments to the commercial real estate market is different from that in past cycles.[11] The reasons for the change in the expected pattern of institutional investors' commitment to the global commercial real estate market are due to how investors have behaved and how the underlying fundamentals have behaved. The changes from past cycles in the real estate market reflect new trends that are likely to continue and accelerate in the future.

In the years that followed the global financial crisis, the commercial real estate market has attracted significant inflows of capital from two major sources. Motivated by low interest rates available in global markets, pension funds, foundations, and endowments, the first source was traditional institutional investors in real estate, who in their search for yield, have increased their allocation to real estate. The second major source is the entrance into the real estate market of nontraditional institutional investors. Some of these new institutional investors have already become important participants in the market, exerting a significant impact on commercial property values and real estate returns. Although other nontraditional institutional investors are now participating in the real estate market, they are still in the early stages of participation. Yet these new market participants may potentially have a major impact on the market.

A particularly important investor that is relatively new to real estate is that of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). SWFs represent a large and rapidly growing capital pool. According to data from Preqin (a company providing alternative asset data),[12] as well one study by the International Monetary Fund,[13] overall assets under management have increased from  \$3.07 trillion at the end of 2008 to\$ 6.31 trillion in May 2015. According to Preqin, 59\% of SWFs invest in the real estate market. However, for the larger SWFs, the percentage is much higher, with 100\% of SWFs larger than 100 billion investing in real estate. SWFs have been investors in real estate markets globally, and they have made their presence felt in a major way. The attraction of the real estate market for SWFs is that they typically have long-term wealth preservation as an investment objective and have few near-term liabilities. As a result, certain types of real estate are a good match for their investment objectives. Because of both the large capital pool and the long investment horizons of SWFs, it is felt that their participation in the market will greatly impact the real estate market.

Another major change in the real estate market is the growth in cross-border transactions. In dollar volume, cross-border transactions have increased steadily since 2009. In 2014, there were 327 billion of cross-border real estate transactions. This level of cross-border transactions represented 46\% of total volume for 2014. The increase in cross-border capital flows can have an important impact on markets. It has been argued that the influx of foreign capital has increased property values in major real estate markets throughout the world, resulting in lower returns.[14]

Our discussion thus far has been on the impact on the real estate market of the participation of nontraditional institutional investors as new sources of capital that is likely to continue to grow in influence. However, some market observers believe it may be small investors who will create the largest changes in the commercial property market. Individual (retail) investors are able to access the private market for private equity real estate via one or more of collective vehicles described in chapter 32. These alternatives for individual investors are relatively new. It is argued that because individual investors may have different investment objectives and constraints (such as liquidity) for their real estate investments than traditional institutional investors, individual investors could alter not only the demand for real estate but also the characteristics of the market in the long term.

## Key Points
- Commercial mortgage loans are nonrecourse loans for the purchase of income-producing properties.
- The major commercial property types are multifamily housing, apartment buildings, office buildings, industrial properties (including warehouses), shopping centers, hotels, health care facilities (e.g., senior housing care facilities), and timberlands.
- Today commercial real estate investments include four categories: (1) private commercial real estate equity, (2) public commercial real estate equity, (2) private commercial real estate debt, and (4) public commercial real estate debt.
- The primary reasons that have been offered for considering commercial real estate as part of a portfolio are to (1) reduce portfolio risk in a diversified portfolio, (2) generate absolute returns in excess of the risk-free rate, (3) hedge against unexpected inflation or deflation, (4) constitute a part of a portfolio that is a reasonable reflection of the overall investment universe, and (5) generate strong cash flows to the portfolio.
- Studies that have examined whether commercial real estate provides high absolute returns or high risk-adjusted returns do not support this reason for investing in this asset class.
- Private commercial real estate equity is held by investors as individual assets or in commingled vehicles, such as private REITs.
- Most countries have one or more property indexes.
- Public commercial real estate equity is structured as real estate investment trusts or real estate operating companies, both entities issuing shares to the public that are traded on an exchange.
- Many developed and developing countries have legislation allowing for the creation of a REIT.
- Equity REITs can be classified as diversified REITs, sector REITs, and specialty REITs.
- Public nontraded REITs are structured in the same way as traditional REITs but are not traded on a public exchange and have the following issues: lack of liquidity, high fees, and lack of share value transparency.
- Private commercial real estate debt is held as directly issued commercial mortgages held in funds, commingled vehicles or whole loans (i.e., single commercial mortgage that has not been securitized), or both.
- Commercial mortgage loans are nonrecourse mortgage loans for income-producing properties that expose the lender to credit risk.
- The two measures that have been found to be key indicators of the potential credit performance of a commercial mortgage loan are the debt-to-service ratio and the LTV ratio.
- Call protection for commercial mortgage loans includes prepayment lockout, defeasance, prepayment penalty points, and yield maintenance charges.
- Public commercial real estate debt includes such structures as CMBSs and REITs that invest in mortgage debt.
- CMBSs are backed by commercial mortgage loans with the deal backed by either loans to a single borrower, loans to multiple borrowers (called "conduit deals"), or a combination of loans that are included in conduit deals with a large or "mega" loan (called "fusion" or "hybrid" deals).
- Fusion-type deals dominate the U.S. CMBS market; in Europe, CMBSs are predominately backed by a single large commercial loan.
- CMBSs are structured to redistribute the credit risk among the bond classes in the deal.
- Despite the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, allocation of institutional investor portfolios to the commercial real estate market has increased, with new entrants, such as sovereign wealth funds, entering the market.
- Commercial real estate is the largest type of alternative asset in which institutional investors allocate funds.
