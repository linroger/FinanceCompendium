Collective investment vehicles are products that are managed by asset management firms. These investment vehicles involve the pooling of funds by investors and the investment of those funds in certain financial assets. The investors then have an equity interest in the net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities) of the fund's portfolio. In general, the advantages associated with investing by means of pooled funds rather than directly in financial assets are obtaining superior portfolio diversification, achieving better liquidity, and acquiring the expertise of professional asset management. Asset management firms receive compensation in the form of a management fee and, with some collective investment vehicles, additional compensation based on performance, which is referred to as an "incentive fee."

The major collective investment vehicles covered in this chapter are investment company shares, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and venture capital funds.

# Investment Company Shares

Investment companies are financial intermediaries that sell shares to the public and invest the proceeds in a diversified portfolio of financial assets. Each share represents a proportional interest in the net assets in which the funds are invested.

The primary U.S. regulator of investment companies is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is the primary legislation governing their regulation. The definition of what constitutes an investment company given in the 1940 act is "as an issuer which is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in 'securities.'" Pooled investment vehicles satisfying the definition of an investment company under the federal securities law must be registered. Hence investment companies are technically called registered investment companies (RICs).

The 1940 act classifies investment companies as management companies, unit investment trusts, or face amount of certificate companies. Our focus in this chapter is on management companies. This category of investment company is typically structured as either a corporation or a trust, with a board of directors (or trustees) to monitor the management of the investment company. The operation of the management company is undertaken by an investment adviser, which is typically a separate entity that is registered with the SEC.

Management companies are divided into open-end companies and closed-end companies. They are more commonly referred to as open-end and closed-end "funds." Although both types of management companies are popularly referred to as "mutual funds," technically, only open-end funds are mutual funds.

# Open-End Funds

Open-end funds, commonly referred to simply as mutual funds, are portfolios of securities—mainly stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Investors in mutual funds own a pro rata share of the overall portfolio, which is managed by the fund's investment manager, who buys and sells securities.

Additionally, the value or price of each share of the portfolio, called the net asset value (NAV), equals the market value of the portfolio minus the liabilities of the mutual fund divided by the number of shares owned by the fund's investors:

$$
\mathrm {N A V} = \frac {\text {M a r k e t v a l u e o f p o r t f o l i o - L i a b i l i t i e s}}{\text {N u m b e r o f s h a r e s o u t s t a n d i n g}}.
$$

For example, suppose that a mutual fund with 10 million shares outstanding has a portfolio with a market value of \$215 million and liabilities of \$15 million. The NAV is

$$
\mathrm {N A V} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2 1 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 - \mathbb {S} 1 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0} = \mathbb {S} 2 0. 0 0.
$$

The mutual fund's NAV or price of the fund is determined only once each day, at the close of the day. For example, the NAV for a stock mutual fund is determined from the closing stock prices for the day. Finally, all new investments into the mutual fund or withdrawals from the fund during the day are priced at the closing NAV (investments made after the end of the day or on a nonbusiness day are priced at the next day's closing NAV).

The total number of shares in a mutual fund increases if more investments than withdrawals are made during the day. For example, assume that at the beginning of a day, the market value of a mutual fund's portfolio is 1 million, with no liabilities, and 10,000 shares are outstanding. Thus, the

NAV for this mutual fund is \$100. Assume that during the day, investors deposit \$5,000 into the fund and withdraw \$1,000 from it, and the prices of all the securities in the portfolio remain constant. These transactions mean that 50 shares were issued for the \$5,000 deposited (because each share is valued at \$100), and 10 shares were redeemed for \$1,000. The net number of new shares issued equals 40. Therefore, at the end of the day the fund contains 10,040 shares, with a market value for the portfolio of \$1,004,000. The NAV remains \$100.

If instead the prices of the securities in the portfolio change, both the total market value of the portfolio and, therefore, the NAV will change. In the previous example, assume that during the day, the market value of the portfolio doubles to \$2 million. Because deposits and withdrawals are priced at the end-of-day NAV, which is now \$200 (after the doubling of the portfolio's market value), the \$5,000 deposit will purchase 25 shares ($5,000/$200), and the \$1,000 withdrawn will reduce the number of shares outstanding by 5 shares ($1,000/$200). Thus, at the end of the day, the mutual fund has 10,020 shares outstanding (10,000 shares initially + 25 shares - 5 shares) with an NAV of \$200, and the market value of the portfolio is \$2,004,000. (Note that 10,020 shares × $200 NAV = $2,004,000, the portfolio value.)

Overall, a mutual fund's NAV increases or decreases as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of the securities in the portfolio. The number of shares issued increases or decreases as a result of the net deposits into and withdrawals from the fund. The market value of the fund's portfolio will increase or decrease for both reasons.

# Closed-End Funds

The shares of a closed-end fund (CEF) are similar to those of common stock of a corporation. The new shares of a CEF are initially issued by an underwriter, and after their issuance, the number of shares remains constant. That is, after the initial issue, no sales or purchases of CEF shares are made by the fund's portfolio manager as with open-end mutual funds. Instead, the shares are traded on a secondary market, either on an exchange or in the over-the-counter market.

Investors can buy shares at the time of the initial issue or on the secondary market. Shares are sold only on the secondary market. The price of a share of a CEF is determined by the supply and demand in the market in which the fund shares are traded. Thus, investors who transact CEF shares must pay a brokerage commission at the time of purchase and at the time of sale.

The NAV of CEFs is calculated in the same way as for mutual funds. However, the price of a share in a CEF is determined by supply and demand, so the price can fall below or rise above the NAV per share. Shares selling below NAV are said to be "trading at a discount," whereas shares trading above NAV are trading at a premium.

Consequently, two important attributes distinguish open-end mutual funds from CEFs. First, the number of shares of a mutual fund varies, because the fund sponsor sells new shares to investors and buys existing shares from shareholders. Second, consequently, the share price is always the mutual fund's NAV. In contrast, a CEF has a constant number of shares outstanding, because the fund sponsor does not redeem shares and sell new shares to investors except at the time of a new underwriting. Thus, supply and demand in the market determine the price of the CEF shares, which may be greater than or less than the NAV.

Although the divergence of the share price from the NAV is often puzzling, in some cases, the reasons for the premium or discount are easily understood. For example, a share's price may be below the NAV because of the CEF's large built-in tax liabilities and because investors discount the share's price for that future tax liability. (This tax liability issue is discussed later in the chapter.) A CEF's leverage and resulting risk may be another reason for the share price of a CEF to trade below NAV. A fund's shares may trade at a premium to the NAV, because the fund offers relatively cheap access to, and professional management of, stocks of another country, about which information is not readily available to small investors.

The relatively new exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are discussed later in this chapter, pose a threat to the growth of both open-end mutual funds and CEFs. ETFs are essentially hybrid CEFs that trade on exchanges but typically trade very close to NAV. Because CEF shares are traded like stocks, the cost to any investor of buying or selling a CEF is the same as that of buying or selling a stock. The obvious charge is the stockbroker's commission. The bid-ask spread of the market in which the stock is traded is also a cost.

Fund Sales Charges and Annual Operating Expenses

Investors in mutual funds bear two types of costs. The first is the shareholder fee, usually called the sales charge. This cost is a "one-time" charge debited to the investor for a specific transaction, such as a purchase, redemption, or exchange. The type of charge is related to the way the fund is sold or distributed. The second cost is the annual fund operating expense, usually called the expense ratio, which covers the fund's expenses, the largest of which is for investment management. This charge is imposed annually and occurs for all funds and for all types of distribution.

Sales charge Sales charges on open-end mutual funds are related to their method of distribution. The two types of distribution are through a sales force (or wholesale) and direct. Sales force (wholesale) distribution occurs through an intermediary, such as an agent, a stockbroker, an insurance agent, or other entity providing investment advice and incentive to the client. Such an entity actively "makes the sale" and provides subsequent service. The other approach is direct distribution, or distribution from the mutual fund company to the investor. The client approaches the mutual fund company (most likely by a toll-free telephone number or website) in response to media advertisements or general information and opens the account. Little or no investment counsel or service is provided either initially or subsequently.

For the service provided in the sales force distribution method, the customer bears a sales charge paid to the agent. The sales charge is called a load. The traditional type of load is called a front-end load, because the load is deducted at the time the purchase is made, or "up front." That is, the load is subtracted from the amount invested by the client and paid to the agent/distributor. Directly purchased mutual funds require no intermediary sales agent and therefore infrequently carry a sales charge. Funds with no sales charge are called no-load mutual funds.

Recent adaptations of the sales load are back-end loads and level loads. Front-end loads are imposed at the time of the purchase of the fund, but the back-end load is imposed at the time fund shares are sold or redeemed. Level loads are assessed uniformly each year. These two alternative methods both provide ways to compensate the agent. However, unlike the front-end load, both of these distribution mechanisms permit the client to buy a fund at NAV, that is, not have any of the initial investment debited as a sales charge before it is invested in the shareholder's account. The most common type of back-end load currently is the contingent deferred sales charge. In this approach, a gradually declining load is imposed on withdrawals. For example, a common 3-3-2-2-1-1-0 contingent deferred sales charge approach imposes a  $3\%$  load on the amount withdrawn after one year, a  $3\%$  load on the amount withdrawn after the second year, a  $2\%$  on the amount withdrawn after the third year, and so on. No sales charge for withdrawals applies after the seventh year.

Another type of load is neither a front-end load at the time of investment nor a (gradually declining) back-end load at the time of withdrawal but a constant load each year (e.g., a  $1\%$  load every year). This approach is called a level load. This type of load appeals to financial planners who charge annual fees rather than commissions, such as sales charges.

Many mutual fund families offer their funds with all three types of loads—that is, front-end loads (these fund shares are usually called "A shares"), back-end loads (called "B shares"), and level loads ("C shares")—and permit the distributor and its client, the investor, to select the type of load they prefer.

The sales charge is, in effect, paid by the client to the distributor. How does the fund family (typically called the "sponsor" or "manufacturer" of the fund) cover its costs and make a profit? This second type of cost to the investor covers the fund's annual operating expenses.

Annual operating expenses (expense ratio) The operating expense, also called the expense ratio, is debited annually from the investor's fund balance by the fund sponsor. The three main categories of annual operating expenses are the management fee, the distribution fee, and other expenses.

The management fee, also called the investment advisory fee, is charged by the investment adviser for managing a fund's portfolio. If the investment adviser works for a company that is separate from the fund sponsor, some or all of this investment advisory fee is passed on to the investment adviser by the fund sponsor. In this case, the fund manager is called a subadviser. The management fee varies by the type of fund, and specifically with the difficulty of managing the fund.

The management fee is typically a fixed fee based solely on the market value of the fund's assets. The fee structure for managing some mutual funds is on a sliding scale, with the fee declining with the market value of the fund's assets. A few mutual funds have adopted performance-based fees, which specify that if the quarterly performance is good, the fund manager receives a fee, and if it is not, the fee is waived for the quarter.

In 1980, the SEC approved the imposition of a fixed annual fee, called the 12b-1 fee, which is, in general, intended to cover distribution costs, including continuing agent compensation and manufacturer marketing and advertising expenses. Such 12b-1 fees are now imposed by many mutual funds. By law, 12b-1 fees cannot exceed  $1\%$  of the fund's assets per year. The 12b-1 fee may include a service fee of up to  $0.25\%$  of assets per year to compensate sales professionals for providing services or maintaining shareholder accounts. The major rationale for the component of the 12b-1 fee that accrues to the selling agent is to provide an incentive to selling agents to continue to service their accounts after they receive a transaction-based fee, such as a front-end load. As a result, a 12b-1 fee of this type is consistent with sales-force-sold load funds, not with no-load funds sold directly to the investor. The rationale for the component of the 12b-1 fee that accrues to the manufacturer of the fund is to provide incentive and compensate for continuing advertising and marketing costs.

Other expenses include primarily the costs of (1) custody (holding the cash and securities of the fund), (2) the transfer agent's activities (transferring cash and securities among buyers and sellers of the securities, making fund distributions, etc.), (3) the independent public accountant's fees, and (4) directors' fees.

The sum of the annual management fee, the annual distribution fee, and other annual expenses is called the "expense ratio." All the cost information on a fund, including sales charges and annual expenses, are included in the fund's prospectus.

Economic Motivation for Funds

In chapter 3, we noted that financial intermediaries obtain funds by issuing financial claims against themselves and then investing these funds. An investment company is a financial intermediary in that it pools the funds of individual investors and uses these funds to buy portfolios of securities. We also noted the special role in financial markets played by financial intermediaries. Financial intermediaries provide some or all of the following six economic functions: (1) risk reduction through diversification, (2) lower costs of contracting and processing information, (3) professional portfolio management, (4) liquidity, (5) variety, and (6) a payments mechanism. Let's consider these economic functions as provided by mutual funds.

First is the function of risk reduction through diversification. By investing in a fund, an investor can obtain broad-based ownership of a sufficient number of securities to reduce portfolio risk. (We are more specific about the type of risk that is reduced in chapter 10.) Although an individual investor may be able to acquire a broad-based portfolio of securities, the degree of diversification will be limited by the amount available to invest. By investing in an investment company, however, an investor can effectively achieve the benefits of diversification at a lower cost, even if the amount of money available to invest is not large.

The second economic function is the reduced cost of contracting and processing information, because an investor purchases the services of a presumably skilled financial adviser at less cost than if the investor were to directly and individually negotiate with such an adviser. The advisory fee is lower because of the larger size of assets managed, as well as the reduced costs of searching for an investment manager and obtaining information about the securities. Also, the costs of transacting in the securities are reduced, because a fund is better able to negotiate transaction costs, and custodial fees and record-keeping costs are less for a fund than for an individual investor. For these reasons, investment management enjoys economies of scale relative to those benefits that can accrue to individual investors.

Third, and related to the first two advantages, is the advantage of professional management of the mutual fund. The fourth advantage is liquidity. Mutual funds can be bought or liquidated any day at the closing NAV. The fifth advantage is the variety of funds available in general, and even in one particular family of funds. Finally, money market funds and some other types of funds provide payment services by allowing investors to write checks drawn on the fund, although this facility may be limited in various ways.

# Types of Funds by Investment Objective

Mutual funds developed out of a need to satisfy the various investment objectives of investors. In general, in the main categories—stock funds, bond funds, money market funds, and others—several subcategories of funds exist. Other funds are U.S. only, international (no U.S. securities), or global (both U.S. and international securities). Still other funds are considered passive or active funds. Passive (or indexed) funds are designed to replicate an index, such as the S&P 500 stock index, the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index, or the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and Far East) Index. These funds are beta products. In contrast, Active funds attempt to outperform an index and other funds by actively trading the fund portfolio and are therefore alpha products. The objective of numerous other categories of funds is stated in the specific fund's prospectus, as required by the SEC and the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Stock funds differ in the following ways:

- the average market capitalization ("market cap": divided into large, mid, and small) of the stocks in the portfolio;
- style (growth, value, blend, and other); and sector specialization, such as technology, health care, or utilities.

With respect to style, stocks with high price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios are considered growth stocks, and stocks with low price-to-value and price-to-earnings ratios are considered value stocks, although other variables are also considered. Some styles can be considered blend stocks.

Bond funds differ by the creditworthiness of the issuers of the bonds in the portfolio (e.g., U.S. government, investment-grade corporate, high-yield corporate) and by the maturity (or duration) of the bonds (long, intermediate, short). Another category of bond funds, called "municipal bond funds," offers tax-exempt coupon interest. These funds may also be single-state bond funds (i.e., all the bonds in the portfolio were issued by issuers in the same state) or multistate.

Asset allocation, hybrid, or balanced funds all hold both stocks and bonds. Convertible bond funds provide another option for investors.

A category of money market funds with maturities of one year or less provides protection against interest rate fluctuations. These funds may have some degree of credit risk, except for the U.S. government money market category. Most of these funds offer check-writing privileges. In addition to taxable money market funds, tax-exempt municipal money market funds are available as well.

Among the other fund offerings are index funds and funds of funds. Index funds, as already discussed, attempt to passively replicate an index. A fund of funds invests in other mutual funds in the same fund family.

Several organizations provide data on mutual funds. The most popular ones are Morningstar and Lipper, which provide data on fund expenses, portfolio managers, fund sizes, and fund holdings. But, perhaps most important, they provide performance (i.e., rate of return) data and fund rankings based on performance and other factors. To compare fund performance on an "apples-to-apples" basis, these firms divide mutual funds into several categories intended to be fairly homogeneous by investment objective. The categories provided by Morningstar and Lipper are similar but not identical. Mutual fund data are also provided by the Investment Company Institute, the national association for mutual funds.

A concept that revolutionized the fund industry and benefited many investors is what the mutual fund industry calls a family of funds, a group of funds or a complex of funds. Many fund management companies offer investors a choice of numerous funds with different investment objectives in the same fund family. In many cases, with a phone call, investors may move their assets from one fund to another in the family at little or no cost. Of course, if these funds are in a taxable account, tax consequences may accompany the sale. Although the same policies regarding loads and other costs may apply to all members of the family, a management company may have different fee structures for transfers among different funds under its control.

Large fund families usually include money market funds; U.S. bond funds of several types; global stock and bond funds; broadly diversified U.S. stock funds; U.S. stock funds that specialize by market capitalization and style; and stock funds devoted to particular sectors, such as health care, technology, or precious minerals companies. According to Morningstar, the 10 largest mutual fund families are American Funds, BlackRock Inc., Columbia Management, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton Investments, Oppenheimer Funds, Pacific Investment Management Co. (PIMCO), T. Rowe Price, J.P. Morgan, and the Vanguard Group. Fund families may also use external investment advisers along with internal advisers in their fund families.

Taxation of RICs RICs must distribute at least  $90\%$  of their net investment income earned (bond coupons and stock dividends) exclusive of realized capital gains or losses to shareholders (along with meeting other criteria) to qualify as a RIC; as such, they are not required to pay taxes at the fund level prior to distributions to shareholders. Consequently, funds make these distributions. Taxes on distributions are paid only at the investor level, not the fund level. Even though many investors in RICs choose to reinvest these distributions, the distributions are taxable to the investor, either as ordinary income or as capital gains (long term or short term), whichever is relevant.

Capital gains distributions must occur annually, and typically occur late in the calendar year. The capital gains distributions may be either longor short-term capital gains, depending on whether the fund held the security for a year or more. Investors have no control over the size of these distributions, and as a result, the timing and amount of taxes paid on their fund holdings are largely out of their control. In particular, withdrawals by some investors may necessitate sales in the fund, which in turn cause realized capital gains and a tax liability to accrue to investors who maintain their holdings.

New investors in the fund may assume a tax liability even though they realize no gains. All shareholders as of the record date receive a full year's worth of dividends and capital gains distributions, even if they have owned shares for only one day. This lack of control over capital gains taxes is regarded as a major limitation of investing in RICs. In fact, this adverse tax consequence is one of the reasons suggested for a CEF's price falling below par value. Also, this adverse tax consequence is one reason for the popularity of ETFs, discussed next.

Of course, the investor must also pay ordinary income taxes on distributions of income. Finally, when investors in the fund sell their shares, they realize longor short-term capital gains or losses, depending on whether they have held the fund for at least a year.

# ETFs

Open-end mutual funds are often criticized for three reasons. First, the fund shares are priced at, and can be transacted only at, the end-of-day or closing price. Specifically, transactions—purchases and sales—cannot be made at intraday prices but only at closing prices. The second criticism relates to taxes and the investors' control over taxes. As noted earlier, withdrawals by some fund shareholders may cause taxable realized capital gains for shareholders who maintain their positions. Finally, it has been argued that the fees charged by asset managers are excessive.

In 1993, a new investment vehicle with many of the same features as open-end mutual funds but that responded to two of the three criticisms was introduced. This investment vehicle, called an exchange-traded fund, is a fund that is similar to mutual funds but that trades like stocks on an exchange. ETFs are, in a sense, similar to CEFs, which have small premiums or discounts from their NAVs. They offer investors beta (passive) instruments for obtaining exposure to asset classes and market sectors that previously could not be accessed easily. As of August 25, 2017, Morningstar tracked ETFs that had total market assets of about \$3 trillion. By far the largest asset class for ETFs was for equity, which was almost \$2.4 trillion.

Every ETF is based on a benchmark index. For the first generation of ETFs, the portfolio manager responsible for the ETF sought to match the performance of the benchmark index by purchasing securities and using the derivative instruments described in chapter 23. Thus, the portfolio manager of the ETF seeks the same total return for the ETF as the that for the index. The second generation of ETFs—and by far a smaller segment of ETF market—consists of actively managed ETFs, where the investment objective of the ETF's portfolio manager is to outperform the benchmark index.

Because ETFs are traded on an exchange, an ETF's share price is determined by the market forces of supply and demand. ETF shares can be purchased on margin, can be sold short, and use the types of orders that are available for taking a position in stocks (such as stop orders and limit orders). There are even derivative futures and options for which an ETF is the underlying instrument. (We discuss these in chapter 33.)

As with a CEF, the forces of supply and demand can cause the ETF's market price to deviate from its NAV. If executed properly, deviations between the ETF's NAV and its market price will be small. This is because arbitrageurs, referred to as authorized participants, can create or redeem large blocks of shares on any day at NAV, significantly limiting the deviations. We'll describe the key role of authorized participants shortly.

A second major distinction between open-end mutual funds and ETFs relates to taxation. For both open-end mutual funds and ETFs, dividend income and capital gains realized when the mutual fund or ETF is sold are taxable to the investor. But, in addition, in the case of redemptions, open-end mutual funds may have to sell securities (if the cash position is not sufficient to fund the redemptions), thus causing a capital gain or loss for those who held their shares. In contrast, ETFs do not have to sell portfolio securities, because redemptions are effected by an in-kind exchange of the ETF shares for a basket of the underlying portfolio securities. This exchange is not a taxable event to investors under the U.S. tax code. Therefore, investors in

ETFs are subject to significant capital gains taxes only when they sell their ETF shares (at a price above the original purchase price). However, ETFs do distribute cash dividends and may distribute a limited amount of realized capital gains, and these distributions are taxable. Overall, ETFs, like index mutual funds, avoid realized capital gains and the taxation thereof through their low portfolio turnover. But unlike index mutual funds (or other funds, for that matter), they do not cause potentially large capital gains tax liabilities that accrue to those who held their positions to meet shareholder redemptions because of the unique way in which they are redeemed.

Finally, the expense ratio for an ETF is generally less than that for a CEF or open-end mutual fund that has the same benchmark index. This is because ETFs are passively managed, unlike most CEFs and open-end mutual funds. Moreover, because of their low portfolio turnover (because most are passively managed), ETFs typically have lower portfolio trading costs than do CEFs or mutual funds.

# Types of ETFs and ETF Sponsors

When ETFs were first introduced into the U.S. financial market, in 1993, and for several years thereafter, the types of ETFs available were all based on U.S. stock indexes and international stock market indexes.[2] The first ETF in the United States was the Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts (SPDRs, pronounced "spiders"), an index fund that was designed to track the performance of the S&P 500 stock index. An ETF that followed was designed to track subsectors of the S&P 500, the Mid-Cap SPDRs. Other ETFs based on other U.S. stock indexes were then introduced. These included Diamonds, which track the Dow Jones Industrial Average and is sponsored by State Street Global Investors, and QQQs, designed to track the NASDAQ 100 index.

Today, there are numerous ETF products designed to track not only stock market indexes but also customized stock market benchmarks and indexes for other asset classes. In fact, Yahoo Finance maintains a website dedicated to ETFs, called the "ETF Center." The ETF Center allows an investor to search for ETFs based on different criteria and by fund family.

As with open-end mutual funds and CEFs, there are actively and passively managed ETFs. Most mutual funds and CEFs are actively managed. In contrast, in the ETF world, most are passively managed. Obviously, the ETFs that are actively managed have a higher cost structure. Consequently, ETFs provide investors with alpha products.

The Process of Creating and Redeeming ETF Shares

The objective of an ETF is for the performance of the portfolio of securities to be as close as possible to that of the target index. That is, the ETF portfolio's NAV should deviate as little as possible from that of its market price. This can only be accomplished with the intervention of a third party that is charged with the responsibility of arbitrating any discrepancy between the ETF's NAV and the share price.

The following is an explanation of the arbitrage process that the agent follows in two different scenarios:

1. Scenario 1: The ETF's share price exceeds the ETF portfolio's NAV (i.e., the ETF share price is relatively expensive). The action taken by the agent in this scenario to generate an arbitrage process would be to buy the underlying ETF portfolio and sell the ETF shares.
2. Scenario 2: The ETF's share price is below that of the ETF portfolio's NAV (i.e., the ETF share price is relatively cheap). In this scenario, the agent would purchase the ETF shares and sell the underlying portfolio at NAV.

The result of the action of the agent in both scenarios would be the generation of a profitable arbitrage. Moreover, the action by the agent to capture the potential arbitrage would tend to cause the ETF's share price to trade very close (or equal) to that of the ETF portfolio's NAV.

We referred to the third party as an agent. Actually, there are many agents, all large institutional investors selected by the ETF's sponsor. Because these agents perform the arbitrage, they are called arbitrageurs. And because they are retained by the ETF sponsor to take the action described above to bring about equality of the ETF share price and the ETF's portfolio NAV by creating and redeeming ETF shares, they are referred to as authorized participants (usually denoted by "AP").

Only an agent is authorized to create ETF shares by providing the ETF sponsor with a specified basket of securities, in exchange for which the agent receives ETF shares, called creation units. These units can be transacted only in large, specified quantities. In scenario 1 above, the action taken by the agent (the authorized professional) results in creation units. When the authorized professional delivers a specified number of ETF shares to the ETF sponsor in exchange for a specific basket of securities, the ETF shares exchanged are referred to as redemption units. In scenario 2 above, the action by the authorized professional results in redemption units.

The arbitrage process just described becomes more difficult for an actively managed ETF. The reason is that the authorized professional does not know what the underlying portfolio is, because the portfolio is permitted to deviate from the benchmark index.

# Tracking the Performance of ETFs

The task of the authorized professional is critical and may seem simple enough. However, a fundamental requirement must be met for the arbitrage process to work: The composition and the NAV of the ETF portfolio must be known accurately, and the securities in the portfolio must be continuously traded throughout the trading day. An obvious example of such a portfolio would be the S&P 500 index portfolio. The 500 stocks in the index are very liquid, and their prices and the value of the index are quoted continuously throughout the trading day.

A study by Buetow and Henderson analyzed a broad sample of ETFs traded on U.S. exchanges. Their sample included all U.S. ETFs for which they were able to identify a benchmark index from the prospectus and to collect return series for both the ETF and the benchmark index.

They found that daily returns for the majority of the ETFs in their study closely tracked returns for the respective indexes and exhibited high correlations with the index. However, some ETFs did exhibit significant tracking error and had lower correlations with the returns of their benchmark index. This poorer performance in terms of tracking error and correlation with index returns tended to be larger when the benchmark index for an ETF was composed of less liquid assets.

Uses of ETFs

In this book, we describe different asset classes and different investment strategies. ETFs provide a cost-effective means for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to asset classes and sectors through either passively or actively managed ETFs.

ETFs can be used to alter exposure to asset classes of the U.S. market. Similarly, by using ETFs that have a non-U.S. benchmark index, the investor can avoid the custodian and transaction costs associated with creating an exposure to non-U.S. markets. An active portfolio manager who wants to alter exposure to a sector of the market can do so by using an ETF that is passively managed. For example, consider an active equity portfolio manager who is seeking to outperform the S&P 500 index and wants to do so by increasing exposure to a sector of the equity market that he or she believes will outperform the other sectors. That is, the manager wants to overweight exposure to that sector. This can be done by using an appropriate ETF. To make the example more concrete, suppose that the portfolio manager wants to overweight the telecommunications sector of the S&P 500 index. This can be done by purchasing shares of, say, the Vanguard Telecom Services ETF. Shorting that ETF would reduce exposure to the telecommunications sector.

Hedge Funds

It would be nice to be able to define what a hedge fund is by, say, pointing to its definition in the federal securities law. However, no such legal definition exists; nor is there any universally accepted definition to describe the 9,000 privately pooled investment entities in the United States called "hedge funds," which in aggregate, invest more than 1.3 trillion in assets.

The term hedge fund was first used by Fortune magazine in 1966 to describe the private investment fund of Alfred Winslow Jones. When managing the portfolio, Jones sought to "hedge" the market risk of the fund by creating a portfolio that was long and short the stock market by an equal amount. (As explained in chapter 18, shorting the stock market means selling stock that is not owned, with the expectation that the price will decline in the future. A portfolio constructed in this way is said to be "hedged" against stock market risk.) Moreover, Jones determined that under U.S. securities law, his private investment partnership would not be regulated by the SEC if the investors were "accredited investors." The securities law defines an accredited investor as an investor who does not need the protection offered other investors by filings with the SEC.[6]

And that is the way federal securities law treated hedge funds until the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. This act changed the registration of hedge funds that had previously been granted exemption because they were "private advisers," replacing the exemption with several narrower exemptions for such advisers as venture capital funds, discussed later in this chapter. Not only did the act set forth regulatory changes regarding the registration of hedge funds, it also imposed reporting and record-keeping requirements. More specifically, the act gave the SEC the authority to collect data from hedge funds. The requirements were put in place not only to protect investors but also to allow the information mandated to be used by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (discussed in chapter 2) to assess the systemic risk that might be posed by large hedge funds.

# Attributes of Hedge Funds

Let's look at some definitions of hedge funds that have been proposed based on their attributes. George Soros is the chairman of Soros Fund Management. His firm advises a privately owned group of hedge funds, the Quantum Group of Funds. He defines a hedge fund as follows:

Hedge funds engage in a variety of investment activities. They cater to sophisticated investors and are not subject to the regulations that apply to mutual funds geared toward the general public. Fund managers are compensated on the basis of performance rather than as a fixed percentage of assets. "Performance funds" would be a more accurate description.

The President's Working Group on Financial Markets, a group created by then president Ronald Reagan and consisting of the secretary of the Treasury and the chairs of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, provides the following definition:

The term "hedge fund" is commonly used to describe a variety of different types of investment vehicles that share some common characteristics. Although it is not statutorily defined, the term encompasses any pooled investment vehicle that is privately organized, administered by professional money managers, and not widely available to the public.[8]

A useful definition based on the characteristics of hedge funds is the following, provided by the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority, the regulatory body of all providers of financial services in that country:

The term can also be defined by considering the characteristics most commonly associated with hedge funds. Usually, hedge funds:

- are organised as private investment partnerships or offshore investment corporations;
- use a wide variety of trading strategies involving position-taking in a range of markets;
- employ an assortment of trading techniques and instruments, often including short-selling, derivatives and leverage;
- pay performance fees to their managers; and
- have an investor base comprising wealthy individuals and institutions and a relatively high minimum investment limit (set at US100,000 or higher for most funds).

From the above definitions, we can take away the following about hedge funds. First, the word "hedge" in hedge funds is misleading. Although the word may have been appropriate for characterizing the fund managed by Alfred Winslow Jones, it is not a characteristic of hedge funds today.

Second, hedge funds use a wide range of trading strategies and techniques in an attempt to earn superior returns. The strategies used by a hedge fund can include one or more of the following:

- leverage, or the use of borrowed funds;
- short selling, or the sale of a financial instrument not owned in anticipation of a decline in that financial instrument's price;
- arbitrage, or the simultaneous buying and selling of related financial instruments to realize a profit from the temporary misalignment of their prices; and
- risk control, or the use of financial instruments (such as derivatives) to reduce the risk of loss.

Risk control is more general than hedging. In a hedge, one often thinks about eliminating a risk. Risk control means that a risk is mitigated to the degree desired by the investor. Very few hedge funds employ hedging in the sense of eliminating all risks.

Third, hedge funds operate in all the financial markets described in this book: the cash market for stocks, bonds, and currencies and the derivatives markets.

Fourth, the management fee structure for hedge funds is a combination of a fixed fee based on the market value of assets managed plus a share of the positive return. The latter is a performance-based compensation referred to as an incentive fee.

Finally, when evaluating hedge funds, investors are interested in the absolute return generated by the asset manager, not the relative return. Absolute return on a portfolio is simply the return realized. The relative return is the difference between the absolute return and the return on some benchmark or index. The use of absolute return rather than relative return for evaluating an asset manager's performance managing a hedge fund is quite different from the criteria used to evaluate the performance of an asset manager managing the other types of portfolios discussed in this chapter.

# Types of Hedge Funds

The different types of hedge funds can be categorized in various ways. Mark Anson uses the following four broad categories: market directional, corporate restructuring, convergence trading, and opportunistic.[10]

A market directional hedge fund is one in which the asset manager retains some exposure to "systematic risk." In the category of market directional hedge funds are those funds that pursue the following strategies: equity long/short strategies, equity market timing, and short selling.

A corporate restructuring hedge fund is one whose asset manager positions the portfolio to capitalize on the anticipated impact of a significant corporate event. These events include a merger, an acquisition, or bankruptcy.

The strategy of convergence trading hedge funds involves the identification of potential misalignments of prices and/or yields that are expected to move back to or "converge" to the expected relationship. The asset manager positions the portfolio to benefit from the convergence.

Opportunistic hedge funds have the broadest mandate of the four hedge fund categories. Asset managers of opportunistic hedge funds can make specific bets on stocks or currencies, or they can have well-diversified portfolios. Two groups of hedge funds fall into this category: global macro hedge funds and funds of funds. Global macro hedge funds are hedge funds that invest opportunistically based on macroeconomic considerations in any market in the world. Probably the best-known hedge fund that falls into this group is the Quantum Hedge Fund. Here are two well-documented strategies that the asset managers of this hedge fund employed that produced significant profits. Based on macroeconomic conditions in 1992 in the United Kingdom, the hedge fund bet on the devaluation of the British currency, the pound sterling. The British government did in fact devalue the pound. In 1997, the hedge fund's macroeconomic analysis indicated that the currency of Thailand, the baht, was overvalued and would be devalued by the government of Thailand. The bet it made on the currency was right. The government of Thailand did devalue the baht.

As we explained earlier in this chapter, there are funds of funds that invest in mutual funds. Similarly, there are funds of funds that invest in other hedge funds. That is, that portfolio of a fund of funds consists of interests in other hedge funds.

# Concerns about Hedge Funds in Financial Markets

There is considerable debate over the role of hedge funds in financial markets because of their size and the impact they have on financial markets as a result of their investment strategies. On the positive side, it has been argued that they provide liquidity to the market. A Federal Reserve Bank study found that market participants described hedge funds "as a significant stability force" in the interest rate options markets.[11] (We describe interest rate options in chapters 34 and 37.) In addition, hedge funds have provided liquidity by participating in the municipal bond market.

The concern, however, is the risk of a severe financial crisis (i.e., systemic risk) as a result of the activities and investment strategies of hedge funds, most notably the employment of excess leverage. The best-known example is the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in September 1998. Studies of LTCM indicate that it used a leverage of 50. That is, for every 1 million of capital provided by investors, LTCM was able to borrow 50 million. The reason LTCM was able to borrow such a large amount was because lenders did not understand or ignored the huge risks associated with that hedge fund's investment strategies. The loss of LTCM because of bad bets is not a concern per se, because the investors in that hedge fund were sophisticated investors who took their chances in the hope of reaping substantial returns. Instead, the problem was that the real losers of that hedge fund's activities were major commercial banks and investment banking firms that lent funds to LTCM. In the view of the Federal Reserve, there were potential dire consequences from the potential failure of LTCM, and the Federal Reserve reacted by organizing a rescue plan for that hedge fund.

More recently, in June 2007, two hedge funds sponsored by the investment banking firm Bear Stearns collapsed: the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund and the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund. These failures required the sponsor, Bear Stearns, to bail out the hedge funds.[12]

As a result of the LTCM failure, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets made several recommendations for improving the functioning of hedge funds in financial markets. The major recommendation was that commercial banks and investment banks that lend to hedge funds improve their credit risk management practices.

# REITs

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are stocks that represent an interest in an underlying pool of real estate properties. They are similar to closed-end funds, because the stock is publicly traded and the market price can differ from that of the REIT's NAV. In the case of REITs, the investments in the portfolio are real estate properties. The principal advantage of REITs is that they allow investors access to an illiquid asset class that would be difficult for an individual investor to invest in directly. Moreover, because a REIT has a large number of properties in its portfolio, individual investors obtain better diversification than by directly investing in real estate properties.

Moreover, tax advantages are granted to a company that qualifies as a REIT. Specifically, under the U.S. federal tax code, dividends paid by a corporation cannot be taken as a tax deduction when determining taxable income. As a result, there is double taxation of corporate income: taxes are paid at the corporate level, and income is then taxed again when distributed to shareholders. The corporate tax treatment for a REIT is different. A REIT is allowed to deduct the dividends paid to its shareholders when determining its corporate taxable income. It is only when the dividends are paid to shareholders that the income is taxed at the individual level, not at the corporate level. Most states apply the same tax treatment to the income of REITs. As a result, to avoid double taxation of income, most REITs follow a dividend distribution policy whereby all their taxable income is distributed to their shareholders, and therefore no corporate taxes are paid.

To obtain the favorable tax treatment granted to a REIT, a company must satisfy requirements set forth by the federal tax code. The bulk of its invested assets must be in real estate-related investments. As for the income generated, the source must come from primarily real estate investments, and at least  $90\%$  of a REIT's taxable income must be distributed to shareholders annually in the form of dividends.

Investors in REITs include retail (individual) investors and institutional investors. Retail investors invest through their nonretirement savings, IRAs, or defined contribution plans. Institutional investors, such as defined benefit plans and endowment funds, invest in REITs to obtain exposure to the commercial real estate market.

REIT ETFs are traded based on various REIT indexes.

# Types of REITs

There are three types of REITs: equity REITs, mortgage REITs, and hybrid REITs.

In an equity REIT, the manager purchases real estate property. That is, the REIT portfolio consists of real estate properties that are owned by the REIT. In addition, the REIT manager may also manage, renovate, and develop real estate properties. Income generated for the investors in an equity REIT is derived from rental and lease payments from the properties owned and any price appreciation. About  $90\%$  of the REITs traded are equity REITs.

A diversified equity REIT invests in more than one type of property. Typically, however, equity REITs specialize in one type of property. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), the leading organization representing the REIT industry, categorizes equity trusts by the type of properties in which they specialize. The categories are:

- industrial and office trusts specializing in industrial and/or office properties;
- retail REITs, specializing in strip malls, larger malls, and other types of retail properties;
- residential REITs, specializing in multifamily apartments and/or developments for manufactured housing;
- REITs specializing in lodging and resorts, holding ownership in hotels, motels, and resort properties;
- REITs specializing in ownership and management of self-storage units; and
- health care REITs, specializing in hospitals and other health care facilities.

Other equity REITs do not fall into one of the categories above because they own such properties as golf courses, timberland, or prisons.

A much smaller sector of the REIT market is the mortgage REIT. This second kind of REIT originates and holds various types of real estate debt that are used to purchase real estate. Thus, the portfolio of a mortgage REIT includes investment vehicles that represent financing to owners, developers, and purchasers of real estate. Mortgage REITs do not own real estate. The returns for investors are generated from the interest earned on the financing they provide.

There are two types of mortgage REITs, based on the type of real estate property: residential or commercial property. Residential property includes single-family homes. Commercial property includes the other types of real estate properties mentioned above when categorizing equity REITs. Thus, mortgage REITs are categorized as either residential mortgage REITs or commercial mortgage REITs. A residential mortgage REIT primarily originates and acquires loans that are used for the acquisition of singlefamily homes. There are only about 30 such REITs in the United States. Commercial mortgage REITs invest primarily in loans and securities backed by commercial properties. The securities that commercial mortgage REITs invest in are commercial mortgage-backed securities, which we discussed in chapter 31. In the REIT universe, only about  $10\%$  are mortgage REITs.

A REIT that invests in both the equity interests and the debt interests in real estate properties is called a hybrid REIT. Hybrid REITs provide lending for the acquisition and development of real estate properties, as a mortgage REIT does, and also purchase and develop real estate properties themselves, as an equity REIT does. Some hybrid REITs specify in their prospectus what allocation between equity ownership and mortgage financing they will pursue. Other hybrid REITs do not fix the allocation between ownership and financing but rather allow flexibility, so that management can capitalize on perceived opportunities in the market.

Benchmark indexes are available to assess the performance of REITs. The most popular index is the FTSE NAREIT US Real Estate Index series, which includes both equity and mortgage REITs. (For the purpose of the index construction, hybrid REITs are classified as either equity or mortgage REITs.) Subindexes are available to measure the different specialized categories discussed above (equity REITs and mortgage REITs), as well as the different categories of equity REITs. Other REIT indexes focusing on U.S. REITs are the MSCI US REIT Index, the Wilshire Real Estate Securities Index, and the S&P US REIT Index.

# Venture Capital Funds

An important participant in the real economy is the entrepreneur who develops new products and services. Entrepreneurs who want to move from their business plan and any prototype that they develop to the formation of a company to implement their business plan need varying amounts of capital. Startup companies typically lack tangible assets that can be used as collateral for a loan and are unlikely to produce positive earnings for several years.

The stages of a startup firm are (1) the early stage, (2) the expansion stage, and (3) the acquisition/buyout stage. In the very early stage, funds are typically obtained from the entrepreneur's own resources, loans or investments from family and friends, and bank loans collateralized by the entrepreneur's personal assets. As the company expands, an entrepreneur may seek funding from an angel investor. An angel investor is a wealthy individual who invests his or her own funds in startup companies for amounts ranging from  $150,000 to$ 2 million. The investment is in the form of either equity ownership or convertible debt (i.e., debt that can be converted into equity). The reality show on the ABC television network, Shark Tank, shows entrepreneurs pitching their venture to some well-known entrepreneurs, such as Mark Cuban. To better research and evaluate startups, angel investors have formed groups or networks. There are more than 330 angel groups in North America, according to the Angel Capital Association.

Entrepreneurs needing funds far in excess of what can be raised from loans and angel investors turn to venture capital firms. In turn, these firms create venture capital funds, which are pooled investment funds.

# Venture Capital Firms

A venture capital firm is an institutional management firm that provides equity financing to startup companies that do not have a sufficient track record to attract investment capital from traditional sources (e.g., the public markets or lending institutions). Venture capital firms typically specialize in one or more stages of a startup firm's business and by economic sector. Venture capital firms typically specialize in industries.

The ultimate goal (the "exit strategy") for a venture capital firm is to sell its equity interest in its portfolio companies through an acquisition or an initial public offering (IPO). After they invest in a company, venture capital firms are not passive investors. Instead, they take an active role either in an advisory capacity or by way of representation on the company's board of directors. The company's progress is monitored, the incentive plans for the entrepreneurs and the management team are designed and implemented, and the startup company's financial goals are established. In addition to providing guidance to the companies in which they invest, venture capital firms often have the right to hire and fire key managers, including the original entrepreneur.

To obtain the funds to invest in startup companies, venture capital firms raise capital from individual and institutional investors. An investor does not invest in the venture capital firm but in a particular fund managed by the firm and referred to as a venture capital fund.

A venture capital fund is typically structured as a limited partnership.[13] A limited partnership has general partners (the venture capital firm in the case of a venture capital fund) and limited partners, who are the investors. The fund's income and capital gains are not taxed at the partnership level but instead are passed through to the investors, who are then taxed. The general partners are responsible for managing the fund, which means evaluating and selecting the portfolio of companies in which the venture capital fund invests. All the fund's partners will commit to a specific investment amount at the formation of the limited partnership. The venture capital firm receives the cash to invest as investors fulfill the terms of their commitment agreement. Unlike investors in the other collective investment vehicles discussed in this chapter, an investor in a venture capital fund must commit funds for a long period of time, typically at least 10 years. No cash contributions are made by the limited partners until they are called on by the general partner to do so. This is referred to as "taking down" the commitment and is done by the general partner making a "capital call." The general partner will make a capital call when startup companies are identified in which the venture capital fund's management team wants to invest. Capital is committed not only by the limited partners but also by the general partner, the venture capital firm. By committing its own capital, the venture capital firm aligns its interests with those of the investors and the firm; that is, principal-agent problems are reduced.

The fees received by a venture capital firm when managing a venture capital fund are the management fee and the profit-sharing or incentive fee. The management fee for most venture capital funds is in the  $2\%$  to  $2.5\%$  range and is used to pay the expenses of the venture capital firm. The profit-sharing or incentive fee, the primary source of revenue for a venture capital firm, provides the firm with a share of the profits generated by the fund and typically is  $20\%$ , although incentive fees as high as  $35\%$  exist.

Here are the stages that a venture capital firm goes through in setting up a venture capital fund. Fundraising from outside investors is the first stage. Although the duration of this stage varies with the reputation of the venture capital firm and the state of the economy, fundraising typically takes from six months to a year.

Once the funds are raised, the fund is said to be "closed," and the second stage begins. This stage involves the firm's management team performing due diligence to assess the potential attractiveness of candidate startup firms in which to invest. This stage can take up to five years, during which time no profits are generated by the venture capital fund. Instead, losses are realized owing to the management fees that must be paid based on the amount committed by the limited partners.

The third stage involves the beginning of investment in the startup companies. The venture capital firm's team of managers determines how much capital to commit to each startup company and what form the investment should take. An investment is typically in the form of convertible preferred shares or convertible debentures. It is at this stage that the general partner (the venture capital firm) will make capital calls to the venture capital fund's limited partners (the outside investors) to draw down on the capital commitment. In this third stage, there is still no income generated.

The investing of funds to create the portfolio of companies is the fourth stage, a stage that lasts almost to the end of the fund's term. During this time, the venture capital management team continues to operate, because it may be involved in several activities discussed earlier in this section. Moreover, it is during this period that the fund will hopefully begin to generate income.

The venture capital fund's final stage is its windup and liquidation stage. By the time this stage is reached, all committed capital has been invested, and the venture capital fund is now reaping the financial rewards from its portfolio of companies. Each portfolio company is sold, brought to the public markets through an IPO, or liquidated through a legal bankruptcy liquidation process. The limited partners and the venture capital firm (i.e., the general partner) are allocated their share of the profits (the incentive fee, in the case of the venture capital firm).

# Key Points
- Collective investment vehicles are products created through the pooling of funds and the management (investment) of those fund by an asset management firm, which receives compensation through a management fee and possibly an incentive fee.
- Retail and institutional investors invest in pooled funds and thereby have an equity interest in the fund's net assets.
- The advantages of collective investment vehicles compared to direct investment in financial assets are better portfolio diversification, better liquidity, professional management expertise, and possibly favorable tax treatment.
- Investment companies sell shares to the public and invest the proceeds in a diversified portfolio of securities, with each share representing a proportionate interest in the underlying portfolio of securities.
- Investment companies must be registered with the SEC and are therefore referred to as "registered investment companies."
- One type of investment company as classified by federal securities law is a management company, which is created as either a corporation or a trust.
- Management companies are further classified as open-end funds (also called "mutual funds") and closed-end funds.
- A wide range of funds with many different investment objectives is available. Securities law requires that a fund clearly set forth its investment objective in its prospectus, and the objective identifies the types of assets the fund will purchase and hold.
- Open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds provide two crucial economic functions associated with financial intermediaries: risk reduction through diversification and lower costs of contracting and information processing. Money market funds allow shareholders to write checks against their shares, thus providing a payment mechanism, another economic function of financial intermediaries.
- Investment companies are extensively regulated, with most of that regulation occurring at the federal level. The key legislation is the Investment Company Act of 1940.
- The most important feature regarding regulation is that the funds are exempt from taxation on their gains if the gains are distributed to investors in a relatively short time. Even allowing for that special tax-free status, it is necessary to recognize that regulations apply to many features of the funds' administration, including sales fees, asset management, degree of diversification, distributions, and advertising.
- Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) overcome two major drawbacks of open-end mutual funds, namely, the pricing of mutual fund transactions only at the end of the trading day and tax inefficiencies.
- ETFs are similar to open-end mutual funds in that they trade based on NAV, but unlike open-end funds, they trade like stocks.
- An ETF has a sponsor. The asset manager of an ETF is responsible for managing the portfolio so as to replicate as closely as possible the return of the benchmark index.
- Although there are no universally accepted definitions of the private investment entities called "hedge funds," these entities have in common the use of leverage, short selling, arbitrage, and risk control when seeking to generate superior returns.
- Despite the term "hedge" in describing these entities, they do not completely hedge their positions.
- The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 requires hedge funds to be registered with the SEC and imposes certain reporting requirements on them.
- Hedge funds can be categorized as market directional, corporate restructuring, convergence trading, and opportunistic.
- The public policy concern with hedge funds has been the excessive use of leverage.
- Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are publicly traded stocks that represent an interest in an underlying pool of real estate properties. Just as with closed-end funds, the market price can differ from the NAV.
- The three types of REITs are equity REITs, mortgage REITs, and hybrid REITs. About  $90\%$  of REITs are equity REITs.
- The manager of an equity REIT purchases real estate property as well as renovates and develops real estate properties. Income for this type of REIT is obtained from rental and lease payments and any price appreciation.
- The different categories of equity REITs are based on the type of property purchased for the portfolio. For example, there are industrial and office REITs, retail REITs, residential REITs, lodging and resort REITs, and health care REITs.
- Mortgage REITs provide financing for properties either by the origination or through the acquisition of loans and investing in mortgage-related securities.
- Hybrid REITs both invest in real estate properties and provide financing.
- Venture capital firms provide financing for startup companies. They specialize by sector and the stage of financing of a startup.
- Venture capital firms create venture capital funds, for which they seek investors. Investors in a venture capital fund commit to a specific investment amount but only have to provide cash when the venture capital firm makes a capital call.
- Capital for a venture capital fund is committed not only by outside investors but also by the venture capital firm itself, thereby aligning the interests of the outside investors and the venture capital firm.
- A venture capital fund's final stage is its windup and liquidation stage. Each portfolio company is sold, brought to the public market through an IPO, or liquidated through a legal bankruptcy liquidation process. Profits are distributed to all investors, and the incentive fee is paid to the venture capital firm.
