In the last seven chapters in this section of the book, we cover financial instruments known as financial derivatives or simply derivatives. The price or value of a derivative is derived from the value of some underlying asset, reference rate, or index. We shall simply refer to the underlying asset, reference rate, or index as the "underlying." The economic purpose of derivatives is to provide efficient vehicles for controlling some risk by transferring risk to another party willing to accept the unwanted risk. For this reason, derivatives are referred to as "risk transfer vehicles." The development of the derivatives markets throughout the world was a response to the need for an efficient risk-transference mechanism as a result of stock price and interest rate volatility. As we will see when discussing derivatives in this section of the book, some derivatives provide for a risk-sharing type of arrangement, whereas others are a type of insurance arrangement.

Derivatives are classified as futures, forwards, options, and swaps. Our focus in this chapter and the next is on futures and forward contracts. Here we provide the fundamentals, some of the more important financial futures contracts, and their role in financial markets. We postpone a description of the pricing of futures and their applications to chapters 35 and 36, respectively.

Futures contracts can be classified as either commodities or financial futures contracts. Commodities futures include agricultural commodities (such as grain and livestock), imported foodstuffs (such as coffee, cocoa, and sugar), and industrial commodities. Futures contracts based on a financial instrument or a financial index are known as financial futures. Financial futures can be classified as (1) stock index futures, (2) interest rate futures, and (3) currency futures.

The three major derivatives exchanges in the world are Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the NYSE Euronext Liffe, and the Euroex. Historically, the trading of futures contracts has been via an open outcry environment, where traders and brokers shout out bids and offers in a trading pit or ring. Although open outcry has been the primary method of trading certain types of futures contracts, since 2004, trading in many financial futures in the United States has moved to an electronic trading platform, where market participants post their bids and offers on a computerized trading system. The trading of futures contracts outside the United States takes place on an electronic platform.

# Futures Contracts

A futures contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller, in which

1. the buyer agrees to take delivery of something at a specified price at the end of a designated period, and
2. the seller agrees to make delivery of something at a specified price at the end of a designated period.

No one buys or sells anything when entering into a futures contract. Instead, the parties to the contract agree to buy or sell a specific amount of a specific item at a specified future date. When we speak of the "buyer" or the "seller" of a contract, we are simply adopting the jargon of the futures market, which refers to parties of the contract in terms of the future obligation they are committing themselves to.

Let's look closely at the key elements of this contract. The price at which the parties agree to transact in the future is called the futures price. The designated date at which the parties must transact is the settlement date or delivery date. The "something" that the parties agree to exchange is the underlying.

To illustrate, suppose a futures contract is traded on an exchange where the underlying to be bought or sold is Asset XYZ, and the settlement date is three months from now. Assume further that Bob buys this futures contract, and Sally sells this futures contract, and the price at which they agree to transact in the future is $100. Then $100 is the futures price. At the settlement date, Sally will deliver Asset XYZ to Bob. Bob will give Sally 100, the futures price.

When an investor takes a position in the market by buying a futures contract (or agreeing to buy at the future date), the investor is said to be in a long position or to be long futures. If, instead, the investor's opening position is the sale of a futures contract (which means the contractual obligation to sell something in the future), the investor is said to be in a short position or to be short futures.

The buyer of a futures contract will realize a profit if the futures price increases; the seller of a futures contract will realize a profit if the futures price decreases. For example, suppose that one month after Bob and Sally take their positions in the futures contract, the futures price of Asset XYZ increases to $120. Bob, the buyer of the futures contract, could then sell the futures contract and realize a profit of $20. Effectively, he has agreed to buy at the settlement date Asset XYZ for $100 and to sell Asset XYZ for $120. Sally, the seller of the futures contract, will realize a loss of 20.

If the futures price falls to $40 and Sally buys the contract, she realizes a profit of $60 because she agreed to sell Asset XYZ for 100, and now can buy it for $40. Bob would realize a loss of $60. Thus, if the futures price decreases, the buyer of the futures contract realizes a loss, and the seller of the futures contract realizes a profit.

# Liquidating a Position

Depending on the contract, there is a predetermined time in the contract settlement month that the contract stops trading, and a price is determined by the exchange for settlement of the contract. The contract with the closest settlement date is called the nearby futures contract. The next futures contract is the one that settles just after the nearby contract. The contract farthest away in time from settlement is called the most distant (or deferred) futures contract.

A party to a futures contract has two choices on liquidation of the position. First, the position can be liquidated prior to the settlement date. For this purpose, the party must take an offsetting position in the same contract. For the buyer of a futures contract, this means selling the same number of identical futures contracts; for the seller of a futures contract, this means buying the same number of identical futures contracts.

The alternative is to wait until the settlement date. At that time, the party purchasing a futures contract accepts delivery of the underlying; the party that sells a futures contract liquidates the position by delivering the underlying at the agreed-on price. For some futures contracts that we shall describe later in this chapter, settlement is made in cash only. Such contracts are referred to as cash settlement contracts.

A useful statistic measuring the liquidity of a contract is the number of contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated. This figure is called the contract's open interest.

An open interest figure is reported by an exchange for all futures contracts traded on the exchange.

# Role of the Clearinghouse

Associated with every futures exchange is a clearinghouse, which performs several functions. One of these functions is to guarantee that the two parties to the transaction will perform according to the contract. To see the importance of this function, consider potential problems in the futures transaction described earlier from the perspective of the two parties—Bob the buyer and Sally the seller. Each must be concerned with the other's ability to fulfill the obligation at the settlement date. Suppose that at the settlement date, the price of Asset XYZ in the cash market is  $70. Sally can buy Asset XYZ for$ 70 and deliver it to Bob, who in turn must pay her $100. If Bob does not have the capacity to pay $100 or refuses to pay, however, Sally has lost the opportunity to realize a profit of $30. Suppose, instead, that the price of Asset XYZ in the cash market is $150 at the settlement date. In this case, Bob is ready and willing to accept delivery of Asset XYZ and pay the agreed-on price of $100. If Sally cannot deliver or refuses to deliver Asset XYZ, Bob has lost the opportunity to realize a profit of $50.

The clearinghouse exists to eliminate this problem. When someone takes a position in the futures market, the clearinghouse takes the opposite position and agrees to satisfy the terms set forth in the contract. Because of the clearinghouse, the two parties need not worry about the financial strength and integrity of the party taking the opposite side of the contract. After initial execution of an order, the relationship between the two parties ends. The clearinghouse interposes itself as the buyer for every sale and the seller for every purchase. Thus, the two parties are then free to liquidate their positions without involving the other party in the original contract, and without worry that the other party may default. This function is referred to as the guarantee function.

Besides its guarantee function, the clearinghouse makes it simple for parties to a futures contract to unwind (i.e., reverse) their positions prior to the settlement date. Suppose that Bob wants to get out of his futures position. He will not have to seek out Sally and work out an agreement with her to terminate the original contract. Instead, Bob can unwind his position by selling an identical futures contract. As far as the clearinghouse is concerned, its records will show that Bob has bought and sold an identical futures contract. At the settlement date, Sally will not deliver Asset XYZ to Bob but will be instructed by the clearinghouse to deliver to someone who bought and still has an open futures position. In the same way, if Sally wants to unwind her position prior to the settlement date, she can buy an identical futures contract.

The importance of a clearinghouse to the success of a derivatives market in general cannot be overemphasized. As explained in chapter 37, some derivatives have provoked increasing concerns about counterparty risk, particularly following the recent financial crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers. As a result, international agreements have sought to ensure that an effective clearinghouse mechanism is implemented.

# Margin Requirements

When a position is first taken in a futures contract, the investor must deposit a minimum dollar amount per contract as specified by the exchange. This amount, called initial margin, is required as a deposit for the contract. Individual brokerage firms are free to set margin requirements above the minimum established by the exchange. The initial margin may be in the form of an interest-bearing security. As the price of the futures contract fluctuates each trading day, the value of the investor's equity in the position changes. The equity in a futures account is the sum of all margins posted and all daily gains less all daily losses to the account. We develop this important concept throughout this section.

At the end of each trading day, the exchange determines the settlement price for the futures contract. The settlement price is different from the closing price, which many people know from the stock market and which is the price of the security in the final trade of the day (whenever that trade occurred during the day). In contrast, the settlement price is the value that the exchange considers to be representative of trading at the end of the day. The representative price may in fact be the price in the day's last trade. But, if there is a flurry of trading at the end of the day, the exchange looks at all trades in the last few minutes and identifies a median or average price among those trades. The exchange uses the settlement price to mark to market the investor's position, so that any gain or loss from the position is quickly reflected in the investor's equity account.

Maintenance margin is the minimum level (specified by the exchange) to which an investor's equity position may fall as a result of an unfavorable price movement before the investor is required to deposit additional margin. The additional margin deposited is called variation margin, and it is the amount necessary to bring the equity in the account back to its initial margin level. Unlike initial margin, the variation margin must be in cash rather than in interest-bearing instruments. Any excess margin in the account may be withdrawn by the investor. If a party to a futures contract who is required to deposit variation margin fails to do so within 24 hours, the exchange closes the futures position out.

Although there are initial and maintenance margin requirements for buying securities on margin, the concept of margin differs for securities and futures. When securities are acquired on margin, the difference between the price of the security and the initial margin is borrowed from the broker. The security purchased serves as collateral for the loan, and the investor pays interest. For futures contracts, the initial margin, in effect, serves as good faith money, an indication that the investor will satisfy the obligation of the contract. Normally, no money is borrowed by the investor who takes a futures position.

To illustrate the mark-to-market procedure, let's assume the following margin requirements for Asset XYZ: (1) initial margin of  $7 per contract and (2) maintenance margin of$ 4 per contract. Let's assume that Bob buys 500 contracts at a futures price of $100, and Sally sells the same number of contracts at the same futures price. The initial margin for both Bob and Sally is $3,500, which is determined by multiplying the initial margin of $7 by the number of contracts, which is 500. Bob and Sally must put up $3,500 in cash or Treasury bills or other acceptable collateral. At this time, $3,500 is also called the "equity in the account." The maintenance margin for the two positions is $2,000 (the maintenance margin per contract of $4 multiplied by 500 contracts). The equity in the account may not fall below $2,000. If it does, the party whose equity falls below the maintenance margin must put up additional margin, which is the variation margin. Two points are worth noting here. First, the variation margin must be cash. Second, the amount of variation margin required is the amount needed to bring the equity up to the initial margin, not to the maintenance margin.

To illustrate the mark-to-market procedure, assume the following settlement prices at the end of several trading days after the transaction was entered into:

<table><tr><td>Trading Day</td><td>Settlement Price</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>$99</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>$97</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>$98</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>$95</td></tr></table>

First, consider Bob's position. At the end of trading day 1, Bob realizes a loss of $1 per contract, or $500 for the 500 contracts he bought. Bob's initial equity of $3,500 is reduced by $500 to $3,000. No action is taken by the clearinghouse, because Bob's equity is still above the maintenance margin of $2,000. At the end of the second day, Bob realizes a further loss as the price of the futures contract has declined another $2 to $97, resulting in an additional reduction in his equity position by $1,000. Bob's equity is then $2,000: the equity at the end of trading day 1 of $3,000 minus the loss on trading day 2 of $1,000. Despite the loss, no action is taken by the clearinghouse, because the equity still meets the $2,000 maintenance requirement. At the end of trading day 3, Bob realizes a profit from the previous trading day of $1 per contract or $500. Bob's equity increases to $2,500. The drop in price from $98 to $95 at the end of trading day 4 results in a loss for the 500 contracts of $1,500 and consequent reduction of Bob's equity to $1,000. As Bob's equity is now below the $2,000 maintenance margin, Bob is required to put up additional margin of $2,500 (variation margin) to bring the equity up to the initial margin of 3,500. If Bob cannot put up the variation margin his position will be liquidated.

Now, let's look at Sally's position. Sally as the seller of the futures contract benefits if the price of the futures contract declines. As a result, her equity increases at the end of the first two trading days. In fact, at the end of trading day 1, she realizes a profit of $500, which increases her equity to $4,000. She is entitled to take out the $500 profit and use these funds elsewhere. Suppose she does, and her equity, therefore, remains at $3,500 at the end of trading day 1. At the end of trading day 2, she realizes an additional profit of 1,000 that she also withdraws. At the end of trading day

3, she realizes a loss of $500 with the increase of the price from $97 to $98. This results in a reduction of her equity to $3,000. Finally, on trading day 4, she realizes a profit of $1,000, making her equity $4,000. She can withdraw 500.

# Leveraging Aspect of Futures

A party taking a position in a futures contract need not put up the entire amount of the investment. Instead, the exchange or clearinghouse requires only the initial margin to be put up. To see the crucial consequences of this fact, suppose Bob has $100 and wants to invest in Asset XYZ, because he believes its price will appreciate. If Asset XYZ is selling for $100, he can buy one unit of the asset. His payoff will then be based on the price action of one unit of Asset XYZ.

Suppose further that the exchange where the futures contract for Asset XYZ is traded requires an initial margin of only  $5\%$ , which in this case, would be $5. This means Bob can purchase 20 contracts with his $100 investment. (We ignore the fact that Bob may need funds for variation margin.) His payoff will then depend on the price action of 20 units of Asset XYZ. Thus, he can leverage the use of his funds. (The degree of leverage equals 1/margin rate. In this case, the degree of leverage equals 1/0.05, or 20.) Although the degree of leverage available in the futures market varies from contract to contract, as the initial margin requirement varies, the leverage attainable is considerably greater than in the cash market.

At first, the leverage available in the futures market may suggest that the market benefits mainly those who want to speculate on price movements. As we shall see in chapter 35, however, futures markets can also be used to reduce price risk. Without the leverage possible in futures transactions, the cost of reducing price risk using futures would be too high for many market participants.

# Daily Price Limits

The exchange has the right to impose a limit on the daily price movement of a futures contract from the previous day's closing price. A daily price limit sets the minimum and maximum price at which the futures contract may trade that day. When a daily price limit is reached, trading does not stop but rather continues at a price that does not violate the minimum or maximum price.

The rationale offered for the imposition of daily price limits is that they provide stability to the market at times when new information may cause the futures price to exhibit extreme fluctuations. Those who support daily price limits argue that giving market participants time to digest or reassess such information if price is restricted when price limits would be violated gives them greater confidence in the market. Not all economists agree with this rationale. The question of the role of daily price limits and whether they are necessary remains the subject of extensive debate.

# Futures versus Forward Contracts

A forward contract, just like a futures contract, is an agreement for the future delivery of the underlying at a specified price at the end of a designated period. Futures contracts are standardized agreements as to the delivery date (or month) and quality of the deliverable, and they are traded on organized exchanges. A forward contract is usually nonstandardized, because the terms of each contract are negotiated individually between buyer and seller. Also, there is no clearinghouse for trading forward contracts, and secondary markets are often nonexistent or extremely thin. Unlike a futures contract, which is an exchange-traded product, a forward contract is an over-the-counter (OTC) instrument.

Although both futures and forward contracts set forth terms of delivery, futures contracts are not intended to be settled by delivery. In fact, generally fewer than  $2\%$  of outstanding futures contracts are settled by delivery. In contrast, forward contracts are intended for delivery.

Futures contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day. Consequently, futures contracts are subject to interim cash flows, as additional margin may be required in the case of adverse price movements, or as an investor who has experienced favorable price movements withdraws any cash that exceeds the account's margin requirement. A forward contract may or may not be marked to market, depending on the wishes of the two parties. For a forward contract that is not marked to market, there are no interim cash flow effects, because no additional margin is required.

Finally, the parties in a forward contract are exposed to credit risk, because either party may default on the obligation. Credit risk is minimal in the case of futures contracts, because the clearinghouse associated with the exchange guarantees the other side of any transaction.

Other than these differences, which reflect the institutional arrangements in the two markets, most of what we say about futures contracts applies equally to forward contracts.

# Risk-Sharing versus Insurance Arrangements

As mentioned at the outset of this chapter, derivatives allow for the transfer of risk. The two types of risk transfer arrangements are risk-sharing and insurance arrangements.

# Risk-Sharing Arrangements

Futures and forward contracts are risk-sharing arrangements because of the nature of the payoff of futures contracts. For simplicity, let us consider a commodity futures contract rather than a financial futures contract.

Consider a producer of crude oil and a manufacturing firm that uses crude oil. Both are concerned about the price of crude oil in the future. The former is concerned that after the crude oil is produced, the future price of crude oil will decline below its current market price; the latter is concerned that when crude oil is needed in the future, its price will be higher than the current market price. Both parties are concerned with price risk. A futures contract allows both parties to manage this risk.

A straightforward way to manage risk is for the two parties to agree to a fixed price at which to transact (buy and sell) at some specified future date. For example, suppose the crude oil producer and the manufacturing firm agree to exchange X barrels of crude oil three months from now at a fixed price of 101 per barrel. By doing so, both parties have eliminated price risk for crude oil three months from now. Both have also given up the opportunity to benefit from a favorable movement in the price of crude oil three months from now. Because both parties are sharing the price risk, a futures contract is said to be a "risk-sharing arrangement."

Given this arrangement, let's consider what happens for every $1 per barrel change in the market price of crude oil three months from now. For every $1 per barrel decrease in the price, the crude oil producer realizes a gain by having agreed to sell crude oil for $101 per barrel when its market price is $100. The gain from the agreement offsets the loss of having to sell a barrel of crude oil in the market three months from now for $100 per barrel. The manufacturing firm realizes a loss of $1 per barrel, but that loss is offset by the firm's being able to buy crude oil in the market for 1 less. Similarly, if the market price of crude oil increases three months from now, the crude oil producer realizes a loss on the agreement, but that loss is offset by the producer's being able to sell crude oil at a higher price. Similarly, the manufacturing firm realizes a gain on the arrangement, but that gain is offset by the higher cost of purchasing crude oil in the market.

This payoff pattern is referred to as a symmetric payoff. Because in such a payoff, every 1 change in the price of the underlying results in an identical gain or loss for the two parties, this type of arrangement is also referred to as a linear payoff derivative.

Interest rate and equity swaps are other types of derivatives that are risk-sharing arrangements.

# Insurance Arrangements

Now that we understand what a risk-sharing arrangement for transferring price risk is, let's look at another way of managing the price risk faced by the two parties in our illustration and introduce a solution from the perspective of the manufacturing firm. By doing so, we will clarify the concept of an insurance arrangement.

Suppose that some third party is willing to ensure that the manufacturing firm will not have to pay more than $101 per barrel for crude oil three months from now. Basically, this would be an insurance contract that the third party would provide. It would specify that for a fee, which is effectively an insurance premium, the manufacturing firm is guaranteed not to have to pay more than $101 per barrel for crude oil three months from now. Let's assume that the insurance premium is 1.50 per barrel.

Effectively, the manufacturing firm is establishing a maximum price for crude oil of $102.50 per barrel, the price of $101 under the insurance contract plus the insurance premium of $1.50. Suppose that the price of crude oil increases to more than $101 per barrel three months from now. Then the manufacturing firm will require the insurer to sell the manufacturing firm crude oil for $101 per barrel. The manufacturing firm effectively pays $102.50 and avoids the higher price. Now suppose the price of crude oil declines to $98 per barrel. The manufacturing firm then just walks away from the agreement (remember, the contract allows but does not require the manufacturing firm to buy the crude oil), losing only the $1.50 insurance premium.

Effectively, the manufacturing firm pays $99.50 per barrel ($98 + 1.50). In this way, the manufacturing firm benefits from a favorable price movement for crude oil but limits the loss to the insurance premium. From the third party's perspective (effectively, the insurer's), there is considerable downside risk, and the upside potential is limited to the insurance premium. This type of payoff is referred to as a "nonlinear payoff," and hence, derivatives with this attribute are referred to as nonlinear payoff derivatives or asymmetric payoff derivatives.

This type of payoff occurs, because unlike the case of a linear payoff derivative, where both parties are required to act, with a nonlinear payoff derivative, only one party is required to perform: the party providing the insurance. In terms of their economic function, nonlinear payoff derivatives are equivalent to insurance, so they are often referred to as insurance arrangements.

What type of derivative has this type of payoff? As we will see in the chapter 34, options fall into this category of derivatives.

# Stock-Related Contracts

In this section, we describe major stock-related futures contracts. Stock-related futures contracts include broad-based stock index futures, narrow-based stock index futures, and single-stock futures. Another type of equity-related futures contract is one where the underlying is some measure of stock market volatility.

Seeking to accommodate institutional investors' need for financial instruments to control risk for portfolios, in 1982, exchanges offered some broad-based stock index futures contracts that covered U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets.

In the United States, the securities law defines a broad-based stock index as a basket of securities for which the weight of any single constituent does not exceed  $30\%$  and the weight of the five largest components does not exceed  $60\%$  of the index. All other indexes are said to be "narrow-based" indexes and stock index futures, which we discuss in the next section. The distinction between broad-based and narrow-based indexes is important, because it determines which U.S. government entity regulates the stock-related futures contract: the SEC or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The former regulates stock index futures contracts where the underlying is a broad-based index, and the latter regulates stock index futures contracts where the underlying is a narrow-based index.

Regardless of the stock index futures contract, its dollar value is the product of the futures price and the contract's multiple:

Dollar value of a stock index futures contract  $=$  Futures price  $\times$  Contract multiple.

For example, the contract multiple for the S&P 500 futures contract is $250. For some indexes, there is a "mini contract." The introduction of mini contracts was to allow for their use by retail (as opposed to institutional) investors. Consequently, when referring to contracts that have a corresponding mini contract, the larger contract is referred to as the "full contract." For example, in the case of the S&P 500 futures contract, the contract multiple for full contract is $250. The mini contract is one-fifth of the S&P 500 futures contract, so the contract multiple is 50.

To illustrate the formula, if the futures price for the S&P 500 futures contract is 2,160.00, then the dollar value of the full contract is 2160.00 × $250 = $540,000, and for the mini contract it is 2160.00 × $50 = $108,000.

Now that we know how the value of a stock index futures contract is determined, let's see how an investor gains or loses when the futures price changes. Once again, consider the S&P 500 full futures contract. Suppose an investor buys (takes a long position in) an S&P 500 full futures contract at

2160 and sells it at 2,190. The investor realizes a profit of 30 points times $250, or $7,500. If the futures contract is sold instead for 2140, the investor realizes a loss of 20 points times $250, or $5,000.

As indicated, the S&P500 futures contract at the CME is based on $250 times the value of the S&P500 (1). So, if the S&P500 was at 3,000, the futures contract would have a value of $750,000. This large size and the resulting volatility made it too large a trading exposure for many individual investors (and speculators). As a result, in September 1997 the CME listed a smaller futures contract on the S&P500 index. It was valued at 50 times the S&P500, one fifth the size of the full-sized contract. The other contract specifications were the same. This contract was traded electronically, not floor traded as were the original contacts. Due to its electronic trading, it was able to be kept open for longer trading hours (Sunday to Friday, 5:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. central daylight time). It is closed for one hour a day for maintenance. Thus, it provides almost 24-hour-per-day market access. The small size, low margins, and long trading hours make it ideal for active speculators. This contract has become one of the largest futures contact in the world. This contract, due to its specifications, is called an "E-Mini" contract. Stock index futures contracts such as on the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P MidCap 400 were also added. These Emini futures prices are continuously available and are covered widely in the press.

Stock index futures contracts are cash settlement contracts. Therefore, at the settlement date, cash will be exchanged to settle the contract. As explained earlier, futures contracts come with margin requirements (initial, maintenance, and variation). Margin requirements are revised periodically. The exchanges classify users of contracts as hedgers or speculators, with the margin for the former being less than that for the latter. Futures positions are marked to market at the end of each trading day.

# Narrow-Based Stock Index Futures

Futures exchanges have found that there are investors who want to take long and short positions in the stock market for a group of stocks and do so by paying for only one trade. Hence only one brokerage commission is paid to trade the group of stocks. These futures contracts are referred to as narrow-based stock index futures.

In the United States, securities law defines a narrow-based stock index as an index in which (1) the index has nine or fewer component securities, (2) a component security comprises more than  $30\%$  of the index's weighting, (3) the five highest weighted component securities in the aggregate comprise more than  $60\%$  of the index's weighting, or (4) the lowest weighted component securities comprise, in the aggregate,  $25\%$  of the index's weighting, have an aggregate dollar value of average daily trading volume of less than $50 million (or in the case of an index with 15 or more component securities, $30 million). Futures on security indexes that are not narrow-based indexes are not subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC.

The unit of trading for these indexes is the notional value of the index divided by 1,000. That is, the market value for each component of the index is multiplied by its number of shares specified in the contract. The sum of all the market values of the components is then computed, and the total market value is divided by 1,000.

Single-Stock Futures

There are single-stock futures on selected stocks: futures in which the underlying is the stock of an individual company. The contracts are for 100 shares of the underlying stock. At the settlement date, physical delivery of the stock is required. Although single-stock futures are traded in several countries outside the United States, trading in these contracts was banned until late 2000.[2] It was not until November 2002 that they began trading in the United States. Single-stock futures contracts can be used by portfolio managers as a substitute for long and short positions in the underlying stocks. As of 2016, on the Eurex Exchange there were more than 1,100 single stock futures from 20 different global markets, including emerging markets.

Stock Market Volatility Futures

A key risk factor for equity investors is stock market volatility. Several indexes have been developed for gauging stock market volatility. These indexes are forward-looking measures of stock market volatility that investors might expect to see over some period of time. The volatility measure used is the implied volatility of the options traded on a specific broad-based market index. Thus, the underlying cannot be purchased in the cash market. When we describe options in chapter 34 and the pricing of options in chapter 35, the concept of implied volatility of an option will be explained.

The first stock market volatility index that has been commercialized is the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Market Volatility Index (VIX), dubbed the "investor fear index." The VIX is based on the S&P 500 index options with 30 days to expiration. Hence, the VIX is a measure of the forward-looking volatility of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days. The methodology developed for the construction of the VIX has been used by the CBOE to create a market volatility index for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (VXD), the NASDAQ 100 (VXN), and the Russell 2000 (RVX). The NYSE Euronext has created market volatility indexes for several European countries: the AEX (an index of 25 stocks traded in Amsterdam), the BEL20 (an index of 20 Belgium stocks), and the CAC40 (an index of 40 French stocks).

# Interest Rate Futures Contracts

Interest rate futures contracts were first introduced in the United States in October 1975. Today, numerous types of interest rate futures contracts are traded, and the number continues to grow. In the United States, the two major exchanges where interest rate futures contracts are traded are the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group (CME) and the NYSE Euronext Global Derivatives exchanges.

Both exchanges provide short-term interest rate futures products that allow exposure to U.S. short-term LIBOR (Eurodollar futures) and short-term euro interest rates (euribor futures). In addition, the exchanges already offer or plan to offer other short-term interest rate products that allow exposure to short-term interest rates outside the United States. For example, the NYSE Liffe trades short gilt futures and Euroswiss futures, allowing exposure to U.K. and Swiss short-term rates, respectively.

Both exchanges offer U.S. Treasury futures, including two-year, five-year, and 10-year Treasury notes, 30-year Treasury bonds, and ultra Treasury bond futures. The ultra Treasury bond futures is a contract created for managing long-term interest rates.

Each futures contract specifies what is permissible to deliver (deliverable grades), price quotations system, tick size (i.e., the smallest price increment in which a financial instrument's price can be quoted), contract months, last trading day, last delivery day, and delivery method. For the futures contracts mentioned above, information is available from the website of each exchange. Here we discuss the two short-term interest rate futures traded on both exchanges (the Eurodollar futures and euribor futures) and the U.S. Treasury futures contracts (Treasury bond, Treasury note, and Treasury ultra bond futures).

Outside the United States, there are exchanges that list interest rate futures with short-, intermediate-, and long-term maturities. For example, the Eurex Exchange includes short-term interest rate futures traded on theeuribor and the Euro Over Night Index Average. The government bond futures traded on the Euro Exchange, for example, include four German debt maturities: Euro-Schatz futures (short-term debt instrument with a term of 1.75 to 2.25 years), Euro-Bobl futures (medium-term debt instrument with a term of 4.5 to 5 years), Euro-Bund (long-term debt instrument with a term of 8.5 to 10.5 years), and Euro-Buxl (long-term debt instrument with a term of 24 to 35 years).

Below we briefly describe the U.S. interest rate futures contracts.

# Eurodollar Futures

One of the most heavily traded futures contracts in the world, the Eurodollar futures contract, is frequently used to trade the short end of the yield curve, and many hedgers have found this contract to be the best hedging vehicle for a wide range of hedging situations.

A Eurodollar futures contract represents a commitment to pay/receive a quarterly interest payment determined by the level of the three-month LIBOR. The dollar amount paid is based on a notional principal of 1 million on the settlement date. Various quarterly settlement dates for

Eurodollar futures contracts are available—March, June, September, and December—that extend out 10 years. The Eurodollar futures contract is a cash settlement contract. That is, the parties settle in cash for the value of the contract based on LIBOR on the settlement date.

This contract is traded on an index-price basis. The index-price basis on which the contract is quoted is equal to 100 minus the annualized futures LIBOR. For example, a Eurodollar futures price of 97.00 means a futures three-month LIBOR of  $3\%$ .

The minimum price fluctuation (tick) for this contract is 0.01 (or 0.0001 in terms of LIBOR). As a result, the price value of a basis point for this contract is $25, found as follows. The simple interest on $1 million for 90 days is equal to

$$
\$ 1,000,000 \times (\text {L I B O R} \times 9 0 / 3 6 0).
$$

If LIBOR changes by one basis point (0.0001), then $1,000,000 × (0.0001 × 90/360) = $25.

# Euribor Futures

The euro interbank offered rate (euribor) is a reference rate at which banks in the eurozone lend unsecured funds to one another. As with LIBOR, this reference rate is an interbank rate. The contract represents a commitment to pay/receive a quarterly interest payment determined by the level of three-montheuribor. The amount paid is based on a notional principal of €1 million on the settlement date. The contract is a cash settlement contract.

As with Eurodollar futures, the contract is quoted on an index-price basis, as follows: 100 minus the annualized futures reference rate, where the reference rate is based on euribor rather than on LIBOR. For example, a euribor futures price of 97.00 means a futures three-montheuribor of  $3 \%$  The minimum price fluctuation (tick) for this contract is 0.005 (or 0.00005 in terms of euribor). Thus the price value of a basis point for this contract is €12.50.

# U.S. Treasury Bond Futures

The underlying instrument for a U.S. Treasury bond futures contract is 100,000 par value of a hypothetical 20-year, 6\% coupon bond. The futures price is quoted in terms of par being 100. Quotes are in 32nds of  $1 \%$ Thus, a quotation for a Treasury bond futures contract of 97–16 means 97 and 16/32, or 97.50. So, if a buyer and seller agree on a futures price of 97–16, the buyer agrees to accept delivery of the hypothetical underlying Treasury bond and pay  $97.50 \%$ of par value, and the seller agrees to accept  $97.50 \%$ of par value. Because the par value is $100,000, the futures price that the buyer and seller agree to pay for this hypothetical Treasury bond is $97,500.

As mentioned, the minimum price fluctuation for the Treasury bond futures contract is a 32nd of 1\%. The dollar value of a 32nd for a $100,000 par value (the par value for the underlying Treasury bond) is $31.25. Thus, the minimum price fluctuation is 31.25 for this contract.

We have been referring to the underlying as a hypothetical Treasury bond. That reference does not mean that the contract is a cash settlement contract. The seller of Treasury bond futures who decides to make delivery rather than liquidate the position by buying back the contract prior to the settlement date must deliver some Treasury bond. But what Treasury bond? The exchange where the contract is traded allows the seller to deliver one of several Treasury bonds that the exchange declares is acceptable for delivery. The specific Treasury bond issues that the seller may deliver are published by the exchange prior to the initial trading of a futures contract with a specific settlement date.

The delivery process for the Treasury bond futures contract makes the contract interesting. At the settlement date, the seller of a futures contract (the short) is required to deliver to the buyer (the long) 100,000 par value of a 6\%, 20-year Treasury bond. Because no such bond exists, the seller must choose from one of the acceptable deliverable Treasury bonds that the exchange has specified. Suppose the seller is entitled to deliver 100,000 of a 4\%, 20-year Treasury bond to settle the futures contract. The value of this bond, of course, is less than the value of a 6\%, 20-year Treasury bond. Delivery of a 4\%, 20-year Treasury bond would be unfair to the buyer of the futures contract, who contracted to receive 100,000 of a 6\%, 20-year Treasury bond. Alternatively, suppose the seller delivers 100,000 of a 10\%, 20-year Treasury bond. The value of a 10\%, 20-year Treasury bond is greater than that of a  $6\%$ , 20-year Treasury bond, which would be a disadvantage to the seller.

To make delivery equitable to both parties, the exchange provides conversion factors for determining the invoice price of each acceptable deliverable Treasury issue against the Treasury bond futures contract. The conversion factor is determined by the exchange before a contract with a specific settlement date begins trading and is constant throughout the trading period of the futures contract for a given settlement month. The short must notify the long of the actual bond that will be delivered one day before the delivery date.

The invoice price for the Treasury bond futures contract is the futures price plus accrued interest. However, as just noted, the seller can deliver one of several acceptable Treasury issues, and to make delivery fair to both parties, the invoice price must be adjusted based on the actual Treasury issue delivered. The conversion factors are used to adjust the invoice price as follows:

Invoice price = Contract size × Futures contract settlement price × Conversion factor + Accrued interest.

Suppose the Treasury bond futures contract settles at 94-08, and the short elects to deliver a Treasury bond issue with a conversion factor of 1.20. The futures contract settlement price of 94-08 means  $94.25\%$  of par value. As the contract size is  $\$ 100,000$ , the invoice price that the buyer pays the seller is

100,000 \times 0.9425 \times 1.20 + Accrued interest = \113,100 + Accrued interest.

When selecting the issue to be delivered, the short will select from all the deliverable issues the one that is cheapest to deliver. This issue is referred to as the cheapest-to-deliver issue and plays a key role in the pricing of a futures contract. The cheapest-to-deliver issue is determined by participants in the market as follows. For each of the acceptable Treasury issues from which the seller can select, the seller calculates the return that can be earned by buying that issue and delivering it at the settlement date. Note that the seller can calculate the return based on the known price of the Treasury issue now and the futures price agreed to for delivery of the issue. The return so calculated is called the implied repo rate. The cheapest-to-deliver issue is then the one issue among all acceptable Treasury issues with the highest implied repo rate, because it is the issue that would give the seller of the futures contract the highest return by buying and then delivering the issue.

In addition to the choice of which acceptable Treasury issue to deliver—sometimes referred to as the quality option or swap option—the short position has two more options granted under the exchange delivery guidelines. The short position is permitted to decide when in the delivery month the delivery will actually take place, which is called the timing option. The other option is the right of the short position to give notice of intent to deliver up to 8:00 p.m. Chicago time after the closing of the exchange (3:15 p.m. Chicago time) on the date when the futures settlement price has been fixed. This option is referred to as the wild card option. The quality option, the timing option, and the wild card option (in sum referred to as the delivery options) mean that the long position can never be sure which Treasury bond will be delivered or when it will be delivered.

The contract specification for the Treasury bond futures has been used in other countries to design a futures contract on their government bonds.

# Treasury Note Futures

There are three U.S. Treasury note futures contracts: 10-year, five-year, and two-year. All three contracts are modeled after the Treasury bond futures contract and are traded on the exchange. The underlying instrument for the 10-year Treasury note futures contract is 100,000 par value of a hypothetical 10-year, 6\% Treasury note. Several acceptable Treasury issues may be delivered by the short. An issue is acceptable if the maturity is not less than 6.5 years and not greater than 10 years from the first day of the delivery month. Delivery options are granted to the short position.

For the five-year Treasury note futures contract, the underlying is $100,000 par value of a 6\% notional coupon U.S. Treasury note that satisfies the following conditions: (1) an original maturity of not more than five years and three months, (2) a remaining maturity no greater than five years and three months, and (3) a remaining maturity not less than four years and two months. The underlying for the two-year Treasury note futures contract is $200,000 par value of a 6\% notional coupon U.S. Treasury note with a remaining maturity of not more than two years and not less than one year and nine months. Moreover, the original maturity of the note delivered to satisfy the two-year futures cannot be more than five years and three months.

# Ultra Treasury Bond Futures

For the U.S. Treasury bond futures, the rule beginning with the March 2011 contract was that acceptable deliverable bond issues had to have a maturity of at least 15 years but no more than 25 years. The deliverable specification for the ultra Treasury bond futures contract calls for the acceptable deliverable bonds to have at least 25 years to maturity. All other specifications for the contract are the same as for the Treasury bond futures contract.

By modifying the Treasury bond futures contract to limit maturity for deliverable bond issues to less than 25 years and requiring the ultra Treasury bond futures contract's deliverable bond issues to have at least 25 years to maturity, the exchange allowed market participants to manage the longer end of the yield curve more effectively. The Treasury bond futures contract is effectively a short-maturity bond futures contract, and the ultra Treasury bond futures contract is effectively a long-maturity bond futures contract that is better suited for managing the interest rate risk for portfolios of long-term bonds.

# Currency Forward and Futures Contracts

Both forward and futures contracts are available to market participants to control foreign exchange-rate risk.

# Currency Forward Contracts

Most currency forward contracts have a maturity of less than two years. Longer-dated forward contracts have relatively large bid-ask spreads; that is, the size of the bid-ask spread for a given currency increases with the maturity of the contract. Consequently, forward contracts are not attractive for hedging long-dated foreign currency exposure. In chapter 38, we will discuss a derivative instrument (a currency swap) that can be used for this purpose.

Futures contracts, which are creations of an exchange, have certain advantages over forward contracts in many cases, such as stock indexes and government securities. In contrast, the forward market is the market of choice for foreign exchange, and trading there is much larger than trading on exchanges. However, because the foreign exchange forward market is an interbank market, reliable information on the number of contracts outstanding at any time, or open interest, is not publicly available.

# Currency Futures Contracts

As explained earlier, futures contracts are exchange-traded products, as opposed to forward contracts, which are OTC contracts. In the case of currency futures contracts, the major exchange is the CME. The exchange rates traded are those between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the following countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.

In addition, there are futures contracts in which the underlying is a cross-rate pair (i.e., an exchange rate that does involve the local currency). For example, for a U.S. investor, the exchange rate between the euro and Japanese yen would be a cross-rate pair. Futures contracts are available on the following cross-rates: the Swiss franc/Japanese yen exchange rate, the euro/Canadian dollar exchange rate, and the British pound/Japanese yen exchange rate.

Futures contracts are also available for emerging market currency pairs with the U.S. dollar and the following four currencies: the Brazilian real, the Czech koruna, the Israeli shekel, and the Hungarian forint. Cross-rate pairs are also available with the euro.

The amount of each foreign currency that must be delivered for a contract varies by currency. For example, the British pound futures contract calls for delivery of 62,500 pounds, the Japanese yen futures contract calls for delivery of 12.5 million yen, and the euro futures contract calls for delivery of €125,000. There are "E-micro" contracts that provide for one-tenth of the contract size. The maturity cycle for currency futures is March, June, September, and December. The longest maturity is one year. Consequently, as in the case of a currency forward contract, currency futures do not provide a good vehicle for hedging long-dated foreign exchange-rate risk exposure.

# Role of Futures Contracts in Financial Markets

In the absence of futures contracts, investors would have only one trading location to alter portfolio positions when they get new information that is expected to influence the value of assets—the cash market. If economic news that is expected to have an adverse impact on the value of an asset is received, investors can reduce their price-risk exposure to that asset. The opposite is true if the new information is expected to have a favorable impact on the value of that asset: an investor would increase price-risk exposure to that asset. Of course, transaction costs are associated with altering exposure to an asset: explicit costs (commissions) and hidden or execution costs (bid-ask spreads and market impact costs).

Futures markets provide another market that investors can use to alter their risk exposure to an asset when new information is acquired. But which market—cash or futures—should the investor employ to alter a position quickly on the receipt of new information? The answer is simple: the one that is more efficient to use to achieve the objective. The factors to consider are liquidity (including speed of execution), transaction costs, and leverage. In well-developed futures markets, it is the futures market and not the cash market that offers better liquidity, far lower transaction costs, and has embedded leverage (a property of futures described earlier in this chapter).

The market that investors feel is the one that is more efficient to use to achieve their investment objectives should be the one where prices will be established that reflect the new economic information. That is, it will be the market where price discovery takes place. Price information is then transmitted to the other market. In many of the markets that we discuss in this book, it is easier and less costly to alter a portfolio position in the futures market. Therefore, the futures market will be the market of choice and will serve as the price discovery market. It is in the futures market that investors send a collective message about how any new information is expected to impact the cash market.

How is this message sent to the cash market? We will see in chapter 35 how the theoretical futures price is determined. That chapter discusses how the futures price and the cash market price are tied together in a specific way and shows that if the actual futures market price deviates from the theoretical futures market price, arbitrageurs (attempting to obtain arbitrage profits) would pursue a strategy to bring them back into line. Arbitrage brings the cash market price into line with the futures price. This mechanism ensures that the cash market price will reflect the information collected in the futures market.

Is it possible for the futures market to take on a life of its own, so that the futures price does not reflect the economic value of the contract's underlying instrument? It could be, if no mechanism were available to bring futures prices and cash market prices in line. This mechanism is the arbitrage we just mentioned and will be explained chapter 34.

Effect of Futures on the Volatility of the Underlying Asset

A criticism that has been frequently raised by some investors and the popular press is that the introduction of futures markets has increased the volatility of prices of the underlying asset. This criticism is referred to as the "destabilization hypothesis."4 Two variants of the destabilization hypothesis are the liquidity variant and the populist variant.

According to the liquidity variant, large transactions that are too difficult to accommodate in the cash market will be executed first in the futures market because of better liquidity. The increased volatility that may occur in the futures market is only temporary, because volatility will return to its normal level once the liquidity problem is resolved. The implication is that no long-term impact on the volatility of the underlying cash market asset will occur.

In contrast, the populist variant asserts that as a result of speculative trading in the futures market, the cash market instrument does not reflect fundamental economic value. The implication here is that the asset price would better reflect economic value in the absence of a futures market.

It is an empirical question as to whether the introduction of a futures market destabilizes prices. However, regardless of whether the introduction of futures or swaps contracts increases cash market price volatility, we might ask whether greater volatility inflicts negative effects on markets. At first glance, it might seem that volatility adversely affects allocative efficiency and market participation.

Actually, some analysts point out that this inference may not be justified if, say, the introduction of new markets lets prices respond more promptly to changes in fundamentals, and if the fundamentals themselves are subject to large shocks.[6] Thus the greater volatility resulting from an innovation may simply more faithfully reflect the actual variability of fundamental values. In this case, more asset volatility need not be a bad artifact but instead may be a manifestation of a well-functioning market. Of course, to say that more volatility need not be bad does not mean that it is good. Clearly, price volatility greater than what can be justified by relevant new information or fundamentals (or by standard asset pricing models) is undesirable. By definition, it makes prices inefficient and is referred to as "excess volatility."[7]

No one has been able to test whether recent financial innovations actually increased or decreased excess volatility. Moreover, as Franklin Edwards has pointed out, "Too little volatility is equally bad, although this concept does not seem to have generated enough interest to have been given the label of 'deficient volatility.'"8

# A Closer Look at the Benefits of Stock Index Futures

Above we have focused on futures markets in general. Let's look more specifically at stock index futures and the evidence regarding several of the issues identified as associated with the existence of futures markets.

First, a comparison of transaction costs indicates that these costs are substantially lower in the stock index futures market than in the cash market. Typically, transaction costs in this market are between  $5\%$  and  $10\%$  of transaction costs in the cash market.

Second, the speed at which orders can be executed also gives the advantage to the futures market. The estimated time to sell a block of stock at a reasonable price is about two to three minutes, whereas a futures transaction can be accomplished in 30 seconds or less. The advantage is also on the side of the stock index futures market when it comes to the amount of money that must be put up in a transaction (i.e., leverage). As explained in chapter 23, margin requirements for transactions in the stock market are considerably higher than in the stock index futures market. Thus, a study by the SEC's Division of Market Regulation concludes:

[Institutions can] sell portions of their equity positions in a faster, less expensive manner by using index futures than by selling directly on stock exchanges.

Futures are used instead of stocks because of the increased speed and reduced transaction costs entailed in trading a single product in the futures market…. As a result of the futures market's liquidity, investors can execute large transactions with much smaller market effects than is possible in the separate stocks.

Which market do investors select to alter their stock market risk exposure? John Merrick found that before 1985, the cash market dominated the price discovery process, relative to the stock index futures market. Since 1985, however, the S&P 500 futures market has played the dominant price discovery role. This reversal of the dominant market was not an accident. It followed the pattern of trading volume. When trading volume in the futures market surpassed that on the cash market, the futures market dominated.

How does the existence of competing markets with the attributes described previously affect the stock market? In her testimony before Congress on July 23, 1987, Susan Phillips, then the chairperson of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, stated: "The depth and liquidity of the futures markets facilitate the absorption of new fundamental information quickly, thus improving the efficiency of the stock markets."10

Critics of stock index futures point to program trading and index arbitrage when a substantial decline in the cash market or increased stock price volatility occurs. As we explained in chapter 23, program trading is a technique for trading lists of stocks as close in time as possible. It is not, as is often stated in the popular press, a trading strategy. Program trades typically are implemented electronically using the automated order-execution facilities of the exchanges that allow orders to be transmitted simultaneously for execution. Why is it important for an institution to execute a list of orders as close in time as possible? Several investment strategies depend on the timing of trades: indexing and index arbitrage. The question is whether either of these strategies that rely on program trading and stock index futures is disruptive to the stock market. We'll describe index arbitrage in chapter 34 and how it ties together cash market prices and futures. Here we just discuss indexing.

Indexing, a strategy explained in chapter 23, is not a strategy that attempts to trade on information. Theory tells us that indexing is a strategy that investors should employ in an efficient market to capture the efficiency embodied in the market. Yet the theory tells us nothing about how to implement the strategy. To manage an indexed portfolio, an asset manager first constructs an initial portfolio to replicate the performance of the market. The asset manager must rebalance the portfolio, however, as new monies are added to or withdrawn from an indexed portfolio. Program trading is used so that all stocks in the portfolio can be sold or purchased by simultaneous order at the closing prices, so that the performance of the indexed portfolio will do a good job of tracking the index. Therefore, indexing should not be a disruptive market force.

Finally, let's look at the issue of the effect of stock index futures on price volatility on the stock market. Several studies empirically investigated the effect of the introduction of stock index futures trading on stock price volatility. In the case of stock index futures, one study concludes:

Investors are concerned about the present and future value of their investments (and wealth). Greater volatility leads to a perception of greater risk, which threatens investors' assets and wealth. When the stock market takes a sharp nose-dive, investors see the value of their assets rapidly dissipating. They are not consoled by being told that there is no social cost associated with this price change, only a redistribution of wealth. Even more fundamental, when asset prices exhibit significant volatility over very short periods of time (such as a day), investors "lose confidence in the market." They begin to see financial markets as the province of the speculator and the insider, not the rational.[11]

A fair conclusion that can be drawn from all these studies is that the introduction of stock index futures (as well as stock index options described in chapter 34 and index-related strategies) did not increase stock price volatility except possibly during periods when stock index futures settled and stock index options expired.

# Key Points
- The economic function of derivatives is to allow market participants to control risk, and so derivatives are referred to as "risk transfer vehicles."
- The key role of derivatives is that, in a well-functioning futures market, these contracts provide a more efficient means for investors to alter their risk exposure to an asset.
- Futures contracts are classified as commodity futures and financial futures.
- Futures contracts are creations of exchanges.
- A futures contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller in which the buyer agrees to take delivery of something at the futures price at the settlement date and the seller agrees to make delivery.
- A party to a futures contract can liquidate a position prior to the settlement date by taking an offsetting position in the same contract.
- Associated with every futures exchange is a clearinghouse, which provides a guarantee function.
- Parties to a futures contract must satisfy margin requirements (initial, maintenance, and variation), and futures contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day.
- Because only initial margin is required when an investor takes a futures position, futures markets provide investors with substantial leverage for the money invested.
- A buyer (seller) of a futures contract realizes a profit if the futures price increases (decreases); the buyer (seller) of a futures contract realizes a loss if the futures price decreases (increases).
- A forward contract is an OTC derivative product.
- A forward contract differs from a futures contract in that the parties to a forward contract are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty and unwinding a position in a forward contract may be difficult.
- Although there is no requirement that the parties to a forward contract mark positions to market, this is typically done to mitigate counterparty risk.
- Financial derivatives can be either a risk-sharing arrangement or an insurance arrangement.
- The type of transfer arrangement depends on the type of payoff: symmetric versus asymmetric.
- Symmetric payoff derivatives (or linear payoff derivatives) are risk-sharing arrangements; asymmetric payoff derivatives (or nonlinear payoff derivatives) are insurance arrangements.
- Futures and forward contracts are risk-sharing types of derivatives.
- With a linear payoff derivative, both parties are required to perform; nonlinear payoff derivatives (asymmetric payoff derivatives) have their specific payoff pattern because only one party to the agreement is obligated to perform, whereas the other party pays a fee to enter into the agreement.
- Options are insurance type derivatives.
- Stock-related futures contracts include broad-based stock index futures, narrow-based stock index futures, single-stock futures, and stock market volatility futures.
- The dollar value of a stock index futures contract is determined by the product of the futures price and the contract's multiple.
- Futures on volatility indexes can be used to manage or speculate on future market volatility.
- Eurodollar futures andeuribor futures are the most popular short-term interest rate futures contracts. Both contracts are cash settlement contracts.
- There are two types of U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts: (1) Treasury bond futures, in which the acceptable deliverable bond issues must have at least 15 years to maturity but less than 25 years, and (2) the ultra Treasury bond futures, in which the acceptable deliverable bond issues must have at least 25 years to maturity.
- The Treasury bond and note futures contracts give the short several delivery options, including the quality or swap option, the timing option, and the wild card option.
- There are currency forward and futures contracts.
- Because of the short-term maturity of currency and futures contracts, they are limited with respect to providing market participants with the ability to control foreign-exchange rate risk.
- Futures contracts on major currency pairs with the U.S. dollar, select cross-rate currency pairings, and select emerging market currencies paired with the U.S. dollar and the euro are available.
- Futures markets are often the market of choice for altering asset positions and therefore represent the price discovery market because of the lower transactions costs involved and the greater speed with which orders can be executed compared to the case markets.
- The actions of arbitrageurs ensure that price discovery in the futures markets will be transmitted to the cash market.
- Critics of the futures market believe these markets are the source of greater price volatility in the cash market for the underlying asset.
- Although the destabilization hypothesis regarding the introduction of futures markets is an empirical question, even if price volatility in the cash market were greater, it does not necessarily follow that greater volatility is bad for the economy.

21. A U.S. General Accounting Office study discusses the importance of derivatives for market participants. Page 6 of the report states:

Derivatives serve an important function of the global financial marketplace, providing end-users with opportunities to better manage financial risks associated with their business transactions. The rapid growth and increasing complexity of derivatives reflect both the increased demand from end-users for better ways to manage their financial risks and the innovative capacity of the financial services industry to respond to market demands.[12]

Explain whether you agree or disagree with the conclusions of the report.

1. The regulator of stock-related futures contract is determined by the agreement between the SEC and CFTC known as the Shad-Johnson Accord.
2. This ban was to the result of an earlier regulatory dispute between the SEC and CFTC as to which regulatory body should have control over single-stock futures. The dispute resulted in the 1984 Johnson-Shad Accord banning single-stock futures. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2002 repealed the ban on single-stock futures, clearing the path for trading of this product in the United States.
3. These costs are discussed in chapter 25.
