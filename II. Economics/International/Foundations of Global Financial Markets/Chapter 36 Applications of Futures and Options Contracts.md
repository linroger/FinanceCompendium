In chapters 33-35, we focused on the general properties of financial futures and options contracts, the specific contracts available, and how they are priced. Although we have alluded to various applications of these contracts, particularly their use in hedging, we did not cite specific applications. In this chapter, we provide an overview of how market participants can and do employ derivative instruments. The appendix to this chapter explains the general principles of hedging with futures contracts.

# Applications of Futures Contracts

We begin with the various ways in which market participants can use stock index futures and interest rate futures.

Stock Index Futures

Institutional investors can use stock index futures for seven distinct investment strategies. We describe these strategies in the following text.

Speculating on the movement of the stock market Prior to the development of stock index futures, an investor who wanted to speculate on the future course of aggregate stock prices had to buy or short individual stocks. Now, a stock index can be bought or sold in the futures market. However, making speculation easier for investors is not the main function of stock index futures contracts. The other strategies discussed in the following text show how institutional investors can use stock index futures effectively to meet investment objectives.

Controlling the risk of a stock portfolio An institution that wishes to alter its exposure to the market can do so by revising the portfolio's beta. This can be done by rebalancing the portfolio with stocks that will produce the target beta, but there are transaction costs associated with rebalancing a portfolio. Because of the leverage embedded in futures, institutions can use stock index futures to achieve a target beta at a considerably lower transaction cost than is possible by rebalancing. Buying stock index futures will increase a portfolio's beta, and selling futures will reduce it.

Hedging against adverse stock price movements Hedging is a special case of controlling a stock portfolio's exposure to adverse price changes. In a hedge, the objective is to alter a current or anticipated stock portfolio position so that its beta is zero. A portfolio with a beta of zero should generate a risk-free interest rate. Such a return from a zero-beta portfolio is consistent with the capital asset pricing model discussed in chapter 14 and is also consistent with our discussion of the pricing of futures contracts in chapter 35.

Remember that using stock index futures for hedging locks in a price, and that the hedger cannot then benefit from a favorable movement in the portfolio's value. (As we explain later, using stock index options has downside protection but retains the upside potential reduced by the cost of the option.)

Two examples of how investment banking firms can use stock index futures to hedge their activities became known shortly after stock index futures began trading. In June 1982, International Harvester traded its stock portfolio to Goldman Sachs in exchange for a bond portfolio. As recipient of the stock portfolio, Goldman Sachs was exposed to market risk. To protect itself against a decline in the value of the stock portfolio, Goldman Sachs placed a hedge on a "significant" portion of the stock portfolio, using all three stock index futures trading at the time to implement the hedge.

The second example involves Salomon Brothers, which used stock index futures to protect itself against a decline in stock prices in a transaction involving  \$400 million of stock. In that transaction, the New York City Pension Fund switched\$ 400 million of funds that were being managed by Alliance Capital to Bankers Trust so that the latter could manage the funds with an indexing approach. Salomon Brothers guaranteed prices at which the Pension Fund and Bankers Trust could purchase or sell the stocks in the portfolio being transferred. To do this, Salomon Brothers used options on individual stocks to protect against price changes in certain stocks, but it also used stock index futures to protect itself against broad market movements that would decrease the value of the stocks in the portfolio.

Constructing indexed portfolios As explained in chapter 23, an increasing number of institutional equity funds are indexed to some broad-based stock market index. Creating a portfolio that replicates a targeted stock index requires outlays for management fees and transaction costs. The higher these costs are, the greater the divergence will be between the performance of the indexed portfolio and the target index. To control costs, many fund managers creating an indexed portfolio will not purchase all the stocks that comprise the index but instead will purchase a group that "tracks the targeted index" or moves in much the same way as the index. As a result, the indexed portfolio produces tracking error risk, which is the chance that its movements will not precisely follow those of the index. To avoid the problems of using the cash market to construct an indexed portfolio, the manager can use stock index futures.

However, note that index fund managers can use stock index futures to create an index fund only if stock index futures contracts are fairly priced or cheap. If the futures price is less than the theoretical futures price (that is, the futures contracts are cheap), the index fund manager can enhance the indexed portfolio's return by buying the futures and buying the Treasury bills. That is, the return on the futures/Treasury bill portfolio will be greater than that on the underlying index when the position is held to the settlement date. In this case, the stock index futures contracts offer yet another advantage to the manager.

Index arbitrage Opportunities to enhance returns as a result of the mispricing of the futures contract are not restricted to index fund management. Money managers and arbitrageurs monitor the cash and futures market to see when the differences between the theoretical futures price and actual futures price are sufficiently large to generate an arbitrage profit. These investors respond to those opportunities by selling the futures index if it is expensive and buying stocks, or buying the futures index if it is cheap and selling the stocks. Index arbitrage plays an important role in linking futures prices and cash prices. Program trading is used to execute the buy and sell orders.[2]

Creating portfolio insurance As explained in chapter 35, a put option can protect the value of an asset. At the expiration date of the put option, the minimum value for the asset will be the strike price minus the cost of the put option. Put options on stock indexes can do the same for a diversified portfolio of stocks.

Alternatively, an institutional investor can create a put option synthetically by using either (1) stock index futures or (2) stocks and a riskless asset. Of course, as market conditions change, the portfolio manager must change the allocation of the portfolio's funds to stock index futures or between stocks and a riskless asset. A strategy that seeks to insure the value of a portfolio through the use of a synthetic put option strategy is called dynamic hedging.

Given that put options on stock indexes are available to portfolio managers, why should they bother with dynamic hedging? There are four reasons. First, the size of the market for options on stock indexes is not as large as that for stock index futures and therefore may not easily accommodate a large portfolio insurance program without moving the price of the option substantially. Second, exchanges impose limits on the number of contracts in which an investor can have a position. Institutions wishing to protect large equity portfolios may find that position limits effectively prevent them from using exchange-traded index options to protect their portfolio. Third, existing exchange-traded index options contracts are of shorter maturity than the period over which some investors seek protection. Finally, the cost of a put option may be higher than the transaction costs associated with dynamic hedging.

In one way, however, hedging with put options does offer an advantage. Although the cost of a put option is known (and is determined by expected price volatility), the cost of creating portfolio insurance by using stock index futures or stocks will be determined by actual price volatility in the market. The greater the market's price volatility is, the more rebalancing of the portfolio will be necessary and the higher will be the cost of creating portfolio insurance.

# Asset Allocation

The decision on how to divide funds across the major asset classes (for example, equities, bonds, foreign securities, real estate) is referred to as the asset allocation decision. Futures and options can be used to implement an asset allocation decision more effectively than transacting in the cash markets would.

For example, suppose that a pension fund sponsor with assets of \$1 billion has allocated \$300 million to the bond market and 700 million to the stock market. Suppose further that the sponsor has decided to alter that bond/stock mix to  \$600 million in bonds and\$ 400 million in stock. Liquidation of 300 million in stock will involve significant transaction costs—both commissions and execution (market impact) costs. Moreover, the external money managers who are managing the stock portfolios will face disruption as funds are withdrawn by the sponsor. Rather than liquidating the stock portfolio immediately, the sponsor can sell an appropriate number of stock index futures contracts. This action effectively decreases the exposure of the pension fund to the stock market. To increase the fund's exposure to the bond market, the sponsor can buy interest rate futures contracts.

# Interest Rate Futures

Market participants can employ interest rate futures in various ways, which we now discuss.

Speculating on the movement of interest rates The price of a futures contract moves in the opposite direction from interest rates: When rates rise (fall), the futures price will fall (rise). An investor who wants to speculate that interest rates will rise (fall) can sell (buy) interest rate futures. Before interest rate futures were available, investors who wanted to speculate on interest rates did so with the long-term Treasury bond: shorting it if they expected interest rates to rise, and buying it if they expected interest rates to fall.

Three advantages result from using interest rate futures instead of the cash market (trading long-term Treasuries themselves). First, the transaction costs of using futures are lower than those in the corresponding cash market. Second, margin requirements are lower for futures than for Treasury securities; using futures thus permits greater leverage. Finally, it is easier to take a short position in the futures market than to sell short in the Treasuries market. As we remarked when discussing the use of stock index futures to speculate on stock price movements: Making speculation easier for investors is not the function of interest rate futures contracts.

Controlling the interest rate risk of a portfolio Stock index futures can be used to change the market risk of a diversified stock portfolio, that is, to alter the beta of a portfolio. Likewise, interest rate futures can be used to alter the interest rate sensitivity of a portfolio. As explained in chapter 11, duration is a measure of interest rate sensitivity.

Investment managers with strong expectations about the direction of the future course of interest rates will adjust the durations of their portfolios so as to capitalize on their expectations. Specifically, a manager expecting rates to increase will reduce the interest rate sensitivity of a portfolio. A manager expecting rates to decrease will raise the interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio. Although investment managers can alter the interest rate sensitivity of their portfolios with cash market instruments, a quick and inexpensive means for doing so (on either a temporary or permanent basis) is to use futures contracts.

Hedging against adverse interest rate movements Interest rate futures can be used to hedge against adverse interest rate movements by locking in either a price or an interest rate. Some examples of hedging with interest rate futures will illustrate the basic concepts.

1. Suppose that a pension fund manager knows that bonds must be liquidated in 40 days to make a \$5 million payment to the beneficiaries of the pension fund. If interest rates rise in 40 days, more bonds will have to be liquidated to realize proceeds of \$5 million. The pension fund manager can hedge by selling in the futures market to lock in a selling price.
2. A pension fund manager who is expecting substantial cash contributions that must be invested but is concerned that interest rates may fall can hedge against declining returns by buying interest rate futures. Also, a money manager who knows that bonds are maturing in the near future and who expects that interest rates will be lower at the time of reinvestment can buy interest rate futures. In both cases, interest rate futures are used to hedge against a fall in interest rates that would cause cash flows to be reinvested at a lower interest rate.
3. A corporation planning to sell long-term bonds two months from now can protect itself against a rise in interest rates by selling or taking a short position in interest rate futures now.
4. A thrift or commercial bank can hedge its cost of funds by locking in a rate using the Eurodollar futures contract.
5. A corporation that plans to sell commercial paper one month from now can use Treasury bill futures or Eurodollar futures to lock in a commercial paper rate.
6. Investment banking firms can use interest rate futures to protect both the value of positions held by their trading desks and positions assumed by the underwriting of new bond issues. An example of the latter is a 1979 Salomon Brothers underwriting of 1 billion of IBM bonds. To protect itself against a rise in interest rates, which would reduce the value of the IBM bonds, Salomon Brothers sold (shorted) Treasury futures. In October 1979, interest rates rose when the Federal Reserve Board announced that it was allowing interest rates more flexibility to move. Although the value of the IBM bonds held by Salomon Brothers declined in value, so did the Treasury bond futures contracts. Because Salomon Brothers had sold these futures, it realized a gain and thus reduced the loss on the IBM bonds it underwrote.

Enhancing returns when futures are mispriced In our earlier discussion of stock index futures, we explained that institutional investors look for mispricing of stock index futures to create arbitrage profits and thereby enhance portfolio returns. We referred to this strategy as "index arbitrage," because it involves a stock index. If interest rate futures are mispriced (even after considering the pricing problems discussed in chapter 35), institutional investors can enhance returns in the same way that they do in equities.

# Asset Allocation

As noted earlier, interest rate futures and stock index futures are quick, cheap, and effective ways to change the composition of a portfolio between bonds and stocks.

Stock options can be used to take advantage of the anticipated price movement of individual stocks. Alternatively, they can help protect current or anticipated positions in individual stocks. For example, an investor can protect against a decline in the price of a stock in her portfolio by buying a put option on that stock. The put guarantees a minimum price equal to the strike price minus the cost of buying the option. This strategy is called a protective put buying strategy. Also, if an investor anticipates buying a stock in the future but fears that the stock price will rise over that time, she can buy a call option on the stock. This strategy guarantees that the maximum price that will be paid in the future is the strike price plus the option price.

Now consider an institutional investor that holds a portfolio consisting of a large number of stock issues. Using stock options to protect against an adverse price movement in the portfolio's value, the institutional investor would have to buy a put on every stock in the portfolio, which would be quite costly. By taking an appropriate position in a suitable stock index option, the institutional investor can create a protective put for the entire diversified portfolio. For example, suppose that an institutional investor, who holds a diversified portfolio of common stock that is highly correlated with the S&P 100, is concerned that the stock market will decline in value over the next three months. Suppose, too, that a three-month put option on the S&P 100 is available. Because the put option buyer gains when the price of the underlying stock index declines, purchasing a put option will offset any adverse movements in the portfolio's value due to a decline in the stock market. This protective put-buying strategy obviously offers a cheap, effective, and flexible alternative to either buying puts on the various stocks or liquidating the entire portfolio and converting holdings into cash.

When stock options or stock index options are used to protect an existing or anticipated position, the investor need not exercise the option if the prices of the held stocks move in the direction that the investor wants. This freedom not to exercise makes options more suited than futures to the task of protecting a cash position. An institutional investor can obtain downside protection using options at a cost equal to the option price, but can also preserve upside potential (reduced by the option price).

# Interest Rate Options

An institutional investor can use interest rate options or options on interest rate futures to speculate on fixed-income security price movements based on expectations of interest rate changes. Because a call option increases in price if interest rates decline, an investor can buy call options if he expects interest rates to move in that direction. Alternatively, because the writer of a put option will benefit if the price increases, an investor who expects interest rates to fall can write put options. Purchasing put options and/or selling call options would be appropriate for an investor who expects interest rates to rise. Remember that, unlike interest rate futures, interest rate options limit downside risk and permit upside potential that is reduced only by the amount of the option price.

As noted, institutional investors can use interest rate options to hedge against adverse interest rate movements but still let the investor benefit from a favorable interest rate movement. It is important to recognize that hedging in this way can basically set a floor or ceiling on an institution's targeted interest rate. We will use the illustrations given earlier for interest rate futures to explain how this works using options.

1. Suppose that a pension fund manager knows that bonds must be liquidated in 40 days to make a \$5 million payment to the beneficiaries of the pension fund. If interest rates rise in 40 days, more bonds will have to be liquidated to realize \$5 million. The hedger will buy put options (that is, follow a protective put buying strategy). If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds to be sold will decline, but the put options purchased will rise in value. For a transaction that is properly structured, the gain on the put options will offset the loss on the bonds. The cost of the safety bought by this strategy will then be the option price paid. If, instead, interest rates decline, the value of the bonds will rise. The pension fund manager will not exercise the put option. A gain equal to the rise in the bond value minus the put option price will be realized.
2. Suppose that a pension fund manager knows there will be substantial cash contributions flowing into the fund and is concerned that interest rates may fall. Or suppose that a money manager knows that bonds are maturing in the near future and expects interest rates to fall. In both cases, proceeds will be reinvested at a lower interest rate. Call options can be purchased in this situation. If interest rates fall, the call options will increase in value, offsetting the loss in interest income that will result when the proceeds must be invested at a lower interest rate. The cost of this hedge strategy is the call option price. If interest rates rise instead, the proceeds can be invested at a higher rate. The benefit of the higher rate will be reduced by the cost of the call option, which expires worthless.
3. A corporation plans to issue long-term bonds two months from now. To protect itself against a rise in interest rates, the corporation can buy put options. If interest rates rise, the interest cost of the bonds issued two months from now will be higher, but the put option will have increased in value. Buying an appropriate number of put options yields a gain on the put options sufficient to offset the higher interest cost of the bond issue. Again, the cost of this strategy is the price of the put options. If interest rates decline instead, the corporation will benefit from a lower interest cost when the bonds are issued, a benefit that is reduced by the cost of the put options.
4. A thrift or commercial bank wants to make sure that the cost of its funds will not exceed a certain level. This can be done by buying put options on Eurodollar futures.
5. A corporation plans to sell commercial paper one month from now. Buying put options on Treasury bill futures or Eurodollar futures lets the corporation set a ceiling on the interest cost of its commercial paper.

# Key Points
- Investors can use stock index futures to speculate on stock prices, control a portfolio's price risk exposure, hedge against adverse stock price movements, construct indexed portfolios, engage in index arbitrage, and create a synthetic put option.
- Market participants can employ interest rate futures to speculate on interest rate movements, control a portfolio's risk exposure to interest rate changes, hedge against adverse interest rate movements, and enhance returns when futures are mispriced.
- Because futures are highly leveraged and transaction costs are less than in the cash market, market participants can alter their risk exposure to a market (stock or bond) more efficiently in the futures market.
- Buying a futures contract increases a market participant's exposure to a market; selling a futures contract decreases a market participant's exposure to a market.
- A money manager can use both stock index futures and interest rate futures to more efficiently allocate funds between the stock market and the bond market.
- Market participants can obtain downside protection using options at a cost equal to the option price and also preserve upside potential (reduced by the option price).
- A protective put buying strategy can be used to reduce the risk exposure of a stock portfolio to a decline in stock prices, guaranteeing a minimum price equal to the strike price minus the cost of buying the put option.
- The purchase of a call option can be used to guarantee that the maximum price that will be paid in the future is the strike price plus the option price.
- By taking an appropriate position in a suitable stock index option, an institutional investor can create a protective put for a diversified portfolio.
- Interest rate options or options on interest rate futures can be used by investors and issuers to hedge against adverse interest rate movements but still benefit from a favorable interest rate movement.
- When contracts are mispriced, a market participant can capitalize on this opportunity by enhancing returns (in the case of an investor) or reducing the cost of issuing an obligation (in the case of an issuer of securities).

9. In a publication by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the following statement appears:

Many people think that futures markets are just about speculating or "gambling." While it is true that futures markets can be used for speculating, that is not the primary reason for their existence. Futures markets are actually designed as vehicles for hedging and risk management, that is, to help people avoid "gambling" when they don't want to.[5]

Explain how futures markets help investors manage risk.

10. The following two quotations are from an article in the Wall Street Journal:

Brokerage firms in the business, which tiptoed back into program trading after the post-crash furor died down, argue that such strategies as stock-index arbitrage—rapid trading between stock index futures and stocks to capture fleeting price differences—link two related markets and thus benefit both.

The second quotation in the article is from a senior vice president at Twenty-First Securities Corp:

Program trading is a product that is here, links markets, and it is not going to disappear. It is a function of the computerization of Wall Street.

Do you agree with these statements?

11. This quotation is from Business Week:

The idea sounds almost un-American. Instead of using your smarts to pick stocks that will reach the sky, you put money in a fund that merely tracks a broad market index. But that is precisely what institutional investors are doing…. Indexing is a new force in the stock market…. But the impact of index-funds reaches far beyond stock prices.

Discuss how indexing may have contributed to the growth of the stock index derivatives markets.

12. This quotation appeared in the December 1988 issue of Euromoney:

The proliferation of futures and options markets has created new opportunities for international investors. It is now possible to change investment exposure from one country to another through the use of derivative instruments, augmented by a limited number of individual securities. Asset allocation in most major markets is now feasible using futures and options.[8]

Discuss the quotation and the reasons for using derivatives rather than cash instruments to facilitate asset allocation decisions.

13. What are the risks associated with cross-hedging?
14. Donald Singleton is an investment banker for a regional firm. One of his clients, Dolby Manufacturing Inc., is a private company that will be making an initial public offering of 20 million shares of common stock. Mr. Singleton's firm will buy the issue at 10 per share. He has suggested to the managing director of the firm, John Wilson, that the firm should hedge the position using stock index futures contracts. What should Mr. Wilson's response be?
15. a. Explain why you agree or disagree with the following statement by Gary Gastineau:

Stock index futures and options were introduced in the early 1980s. Their introduction was partly a response to institutional portfolio managers' preference for trading portfolios rather than individual stocks and partly a way of reducing transaction costs in the implementation of asset-allocation and market-timing decisions.

b. In the same article, Gary Gastineau made the following statement:

Long positions in stock index futures combined with short-term fixed income securities are an almost perfect substitute for a stock index portfolio. Conversely, selling futures contracts against a portfolio of stocks is a low-cost way to reduce market exposure.

Explain the conditions that must hold for this statement to be true.

16. An associate who is not an expert in financial futures has been reviewing a publication describing the three-year and 10-year Moscow City bonds published by the Russian Trading System Stock Exchange. In the publication, the following appears:

Futures on the 3Y and 10Y Moscow City bonds are standard long-term contracts. The underlying asset—the basket of bonds issued by the Government of Moscow—is the benchmark Russian fixed-income market instrument. Futures on the bond basket allow investors to hedge not only risks associated with Moscow City bonds but also risks related to bonds issued by other entities.

The publication goes on to say:

Futures on the 3Y and 10Y Moscow City bonds provide fixed-income traders with the following additional advantages:

- portfolio risk management
- short-selling abilities
- bond margin trading abilities
- the ability to create synthetic "short-term" bonds
- portfolio duration management abilities
- reduction in transaction costs
- using the spreads between the short-term and long-term interest rates without using the underlying assets
- using the spreads between the hard currency-denominated and ruble-denominated interest rates without using the underlying assets
- arbitrage possibilities.

Your associate has asked you to explain the following advantages from using these contracts: a. Hedging "not only risks associated with Moscow City bonds but also risks related to bonds issued by other entities."

b. "Short-selling abilities."

c. "Portfolio duration management abilities" d. "Reduction in transaction costs."

e. "Using the spreads between the short-term and long-term interest rates without using the underlying assets."

# Appendix: General Principles of Hedging with Futures

The major function of futures markets is to transfer price risk from hedgers to speculators. That is, risk is transferred from those willing to pay to avoid risk to those wanting to assume the risk in the hope of gain.

Hedging in this case is the employment of a futures transaction as a temporary substitute for a transaction to be made in the cash market. The hedge position locks in a value for the cash position. As long as cash and futures prices move together, any loss realized on one position (whether cash or futures) will be offset by a profit on the other position. When the profit and loss are equal, the hedge is called a perfect hedge. In a market where the futures contract is correctly priced, a perfect hedge should provide a return equal to the risk-free rate.

# Risks Associated with Hedging

In practice, hedging is not that simple. The amount of the loss or profit on a hedge will be determined by the relationship between the cash price and the futures price when a hedge is placed and when it is lifted. The difference between the cash price and the futures price is called the basis. That is,

Basis = Cash price - Futures price.

As we explained earlier, if a futures contract is priced according to its theoretical value, the difference between the cash price and the futures price should be equal to the cost of carry. The risk that the hedger takes is that the basis will change, which is called basis risk. Therefore, hedging involves the substitution of basis risk for price risk, that is, the substitution of the risk that the basis will change for the risk that the cash price will change.

When a futures contract is used to hedge a position where either the portfolio or the individual financial instrument is not identical to the instrument underlying the futures, it is called cross-hedging. Cross-hedging is common in asset/liability and portfolio management, because no futures contracts are typically available on specific common stock shares and bonds. Cross-hedging introduces another risk—the risk that the price movement of the underlying instrument of the futures contract may not accurately track the price movement of the portfolio or financial instrument to be hedged. This risk is called cross-hedging risk. Therefore, the effectiveness of a cross-hedge will be determined by:

1. The relationship between the cash price of the underlying instrument and its futures price when a hedge is placed and when it is lifted.
2. The relationship between the market (cash) value of the portfolio and the cash price of the instrument underlying the futures contract when the hedge is placed and when it is lifted.

# Short Hedge and Long Hedge

A short hedge is used to protect against a decline in the future cash price of a financial instrument or portfolio. To execute a short hedge, the hedger sells a futures contract (agrees to make delivery). Consequently, a short hedge is also known as a sell hedge. By establishing a short hedge, the hedger has fixed the future cash price and transferred the price risk of ownership to the buyer of the futures contract.

A long hedge is undertaken to protect against an increase in the price of a financial instrument or portfolio to be purchased in the cash market at some future time. In a long hedge, the hedger buys a futures contract (agrees to accept delivery). A long hedge is also known as a buy hedge.

# Illustrations of Hedging

Although our focus in this chapter is on financial derivatives, to illustrate hedging, we present several numerical examples from the traditional commodities markets. It is better to start with traditional commodities, because they are simpler than most financial futures contracts. The principles illustrated are equally applicable to financial futures contracts, but it is easier to grasp the sense of the commodities product example without getting into the nuances of financial contracts.

Assume that a mining company expects to sell 1,000 ounces of palladium one week from now and that the management of a manufacturing company plans to purchase 1,000 ounces of palladium one week from now. The managers of both the mining company and the manufacturing company want to lock in a price—that is, they both want to eliminate the price risk associated with palladium one week from now. The cash price for palladium is currently  \$352.40 per ounce. The cash price is also called the spot price. The futures price for palladium is currently\$ 397.80 per ounce. Each futures contract is for 100 (troy) ounces of palladium.

Because the mining company seeks protection against a decline in the price of palladium, the company will place a short hedge. That is, the mining company will promise to make delivery of palladium at the current futures price. The mining company will sell 10 futures contracts.

The management of the manufacturing company seeks protection against an increase in the price of palladium. Consequently, it will place a long hedge. That is, it will agree to accept delivery of palladium at the futures price. Because it is seeking protection against a price increase for 1,000 ounces of palladium, it will buy 10 contracts.

Let's look at what happens under various scenarios for the cash price and futures price of palladium one week from now when the hedge is lifted.

# Perfect Hedge

Suppose that at the time the hedge is lifted, the cash price has declined to \$304.20 and the futures price has declined to \$349.60. Notice what has happened to the basis under this scenario. At the time the hedge is placed, the basis is -$45.40 ($352.40 - \$397.80). When the hedge is lifted, the basis is still -$45.40 ($304.20 - \$349.60).

The mining company wanted to lock in a price of \$352.40 per ounce of palladium, or \$352,400 for 1,000 ounces. The company sold 10 futures contracts at a price of  \$397.80 per ounce, or\$ 397,800 for 1,000 ounces. When the hedge is lifted, the value of 1,000 ounces of palladium is $304,200 ($304.20 × 1,000). The palladium mining company realizes a decline in the cash market in the value of its palladium of \$48,200. However, the futures price has declined to \$349.60, or \$349,600 for 1,000 ounces. The mining company thus realizes a \$48,200 gain in the futures market. The net result is that the gain in the futures market matches the loss in the cash market. Consequently, the mining company does not realize an overall gain or loss. This example of a perfect hedge is summarized in table A36.1.

The outcome for the manufacturing company of its long hedge is also summarized in table A36.1. Because of the decline in the cash price, the manufacturing company realizes a gain in the cash market equal to 48,200 but realizes a loss of the same amount in the futures market. Therefore the long hedge is also a perfect hedge.

This scenario illustrates two important points. First, both participants incur no overall gain or loss, because the basis did not change when the hedge was lifted. Consequently, if the basis does not change, the effective purchase or sale price ends up being the cash price on the day the hedge is set. Second, note that the management of the manufacturing company would have been better off had it not hedged. The cost of the palladium would have been 48,200 less. This result, however, should not be interpreted as a sign of a bad decision. Managers are usually not in the business of speculating on the price of palladium, and hedging is the standard practice used to protect against an increase in the cost of doing business in the future. The "price" of obtaining this protection is the potential windfall that one gives up.

Suppose that when the hedge is lifted, the cash price of palladium has increased to  \$392.50 and the futures price has increased to\$ 437.90. Notice that the basis is unchanged at -\$45.40. Because the basis is unchanged, the effective purchase and sale price will equal the price of palladium at the time the hedge is placed. The mining company will gain in the cash market, because the value of 1,000 ounces of palladium is $392,500 ($392.50 × 1,000) and represents a \$40,100 gain compared to the cash value at the time the hedge was placed. However, the mining company must liquidate its position in the futures market by buying 10 futures contracts at a total price of \$437,900, which is \$40,100 more than the price when the contracts were sold. The loss in the futures market offsets the gain in the cash market. The results of this hedge are summarized in table A36.2.

The manufacturing company realizes a  \$40,100 gain in the futures market but will have to pay\$ 40,100 more in the cash market to acquire 1,000 ounces of palladium. The results of this hedge are also summarized in table A36.2.

Notice that in this scenario, the management of the manufacturing company saved 40,100 by employing a hedge. In contrast, the mining company would have been better off had it not hedged and simply sold its product on the market one week later. However, it must be emphasized that the management of the mining company, just like the management of the manufacturing company, employed a hedge to protect against unforeseen adverse price changes in the cash market, and the price of this protection is that one forgoes the favorable price changes enjoyed by those who do not hedge.

In the two previous scenarios, we assumed that the basis does not change. In the real world, however, the basis frequently changes between the time a hedge is placed and the time it is lifted.

Assume that the cash price of palladium decreases to \$304.20, just as in the first scenario; however, assume further that the futures price decreases to \$385.80 rather than \$349.60. The basis has now declined from -$45.40 to -$81.60 ($304.20 - $385.80). The results are summarized in table A36.3. For the short hedge, the \$48,200 loss in the cash market is only partially offset by the \$12,000 gain realized in the futures market. Consequently, the hedge resulted in an overall loss of \$36,200.

Several points are pertinent here. First, if the mining company did not hedge, the loss would have been  \$48,200, because the value of its 1,000 ounces of palladium is\$ 304,200 compared to the value \$352,400 just one week earlier. Although the hedge is not perfect, the loss of \$36,200 is less than the loss of \$48,200 that would have occurred without the hedge, which is what we meant earlier by stating that hedging substitutes basis risk for price risk. Second, the management of the manufacturing company faces the same problem from the opposite perspective. An unexpected gain for one participant results in an unexpected loss of equal dollar value for the other. That is, the participants face a zero-sum game, because they hold identically opposite cash and futures positions. Consequently, the manufacturing company would realize an overall gain of \$36,200 from its long (buy) hedge. This gain represents a gain in the cash market of \$48,200 and a realized loss in the futures market of \$12,000.

Suppose that the cash price increases to 392.50 per ounce, just as in the second scenario, but that the basis widens to -81.60. That is, at the time the hedge is lifted, the futures price has increased to \$474.10. The results of this hedge are summarized in table A36.4.

As a result of the long hedge, the manufacturing company realizes a gain of  \$76,300 in the futures market but only a\$ 40,100 loss in the cash market, for an overall gain of \$36,200. For the mining company, the overall loss is \$36,200.

In the two previous scenarios, it was assumed that the basis widened. It can be demonstrated that if the basis narrowed, the outcome will not be a perfect hedge.

# Cross-Hedging

Suppose that a mining company on a faraway planet plans to sell 2,500 ounces of kryptonite one week from now, and that a manufacturing company plans to purchase the same amount of kryptonite in one week. Both parties want to hedge against price risk.[10] However, kryptonite futures contracts are not currently traded. Both parties believe a close relationship exists between the price of kryptonite and the price of palladium. Specifically, both parties believe that the cash price of kryptonite will remain at  $40\%$  of the cash price of palladium. The cash price of kryptonite is currently  $\$140.96$  per ounce, and the cash price of palladium is currently  $\$352.40$  per ounce. The futures price of palladium is currently  $\$397.80$  per ounce.

We shall examine various scenarios to see how effective the cross-hedge will be. In each scenario, the palladium basis is held constant at -\45.40 We make this assumption so that we can focus on the importance of the relationship between the two cash prices at the two points in time.

Before proceeding, we must first determine how many palladium futures contracts should be used in the cross-hedge. The value of 2,500 ounces of kryptonite at the cash price of  \$140.96 per ounce is\$ 352,400. To protect the value of the kryptonite using palladium futures, the cash value of 1,000 ounces of palladium ($352,400/$352.40) must be hedged. Because each palladium futures contract covers 100 ounces, 10 palladium futures contracts will be used.

Suppose that the cash prices of kryptonite and palladium decrease to 121.68 and 304.20 per ounce, respectively, and that the futures price of palladium decreases to 349.60 per ounce. The relationship between the cash price of kryptonite and the cash price of palladium when the cross-hedge was placed holds when the cross-hedge is lifted. That is, the cash price of kryptonite is 40\% of the cash price of palladium. The palladium basis stays constant at -\45.40. The outcome for the short and long cross-hedge is summarized in table A36.5.

The short cross-hedge produces a gain of 48,200 in the futures market and an exactly offsetting loss in the cash market. The opposite occurs for the long cross-hedge. Neither an overall gain nor a loss from the cross-hedge accrues for either hedger in this scenario. The same would occur if the cash prices of both commodities increase by the same percentage and the basis does not change.

Suppose that the cash price of both commodities decreases, but the cash price of kryptonite falls by a greater percentage than that of palladium. For example, suppose that the cash price of kryptonite falls to 112.00 per ounce, and the cash price of palladium falls to  \$304.20 per ounce. The futures price of palladium falls to\$ 349.60, so that the basis is not changed. The cash price of kryptonite at the time the cross-hedge is lifted is 37\% of the cash price of palladium, rather than the 40\% when the cross-hedge was constructed. The outcomes for the long and short cross-hedge are shown in table A36.6.

For the short cross-hedge, the loss in the cash market exceeds the realized gain in the futures market by 24,200. For the long cross-hedge, the opposite is true. An overall gain of 24,200 results from the cross-hedge.

If the cash price of kryptonite had fallen by a smaller percentage amount than the cash price of palladium, the short cross-hedge would have produced an overall gain, whereas the long cross-hedge would have generated an overall loss.

Suppose that the cash price of kryptonite falls to  \$121.68 per ounce, whereas the cash price and futures price of palladium rise to\$ 392.50 and 437.90, respectively. The results of the cross-hedge are shown in table A36.7.

The short cross-hedge results in a loss in both the cash market and the futures market. The overall loss is  \$88,300. Had the kryptonite mining company not used the cross-hedge, its loss would have been limited to the decline in the cash price—\$ 48,200, in this instance. In contrast, the long hedger realizes a gain in both the cash and futures market, and therefore an overall gain.

If instead the cash price of kryptonite increases to \$189.10 per ounce, and the cash and futures price of palladium decline to \$304.20 and \$349.60, respectively, it can be demonstrated that the long cross-hedge results in a loss in both the cash and futures markets. The total loss is \$168,550. The loss would have been only 120,350 (that is, the loss in the cash market), had the management of the manufacturing company not cross-hedged with palladium.

These illustrations demonstrate the risks associated with cross-hedging.
