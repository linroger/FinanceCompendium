Interest rate futures and options can be used to control interest rate risk. Commercial banks and investment banks also customize other contracts useful for controlling interest rate risk for their clients. These include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward rate agreements. According to a survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), trading in over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives markets dominates the OTC derivatives market. As of year end 2017, the gross market value of OTC interest rate derivatives was 7.6 trillion. In this chapter, we review each type of OTC interest rate derivative and explain how borrowers and institutional investors use them.

A forward rate agreement (FRA) is the OTC equivalent of the exchange-traded futures contracts on short-term rates. Typically, the short-term rate is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

The elements of an FRA are the contract rate, reference rate, settlement rate, notional amount, and settlement date. The parties to an FRA agree to buy and sell funds on the settlement date. The FRA's contract rate is the rate specified in the FRA at which the buyer of the FRA agrees to pay for funds and the seller of the FRA agrees to receive for investing funds. The reference rate is the interest rate used. For example, the reference rate could be the three-month or six-month LIBOR. The benchmark from which the interest payments are to be calculated is specified in the FRA and is called the notional amount (or "notional principal amount"). This amount is not exchanged between the two parties. The settlement rate is the value of the reference rate at the FRA's settlement date. The source for determining the settlement rate is specified in the FRA.

The buyer of the FRA is agreeing to pay the contract rate, or equivalently, to buy funds at the settlement date at the contract rate; the seller of the FRA is agreeing to receive the contract rate, or equivalently, to sell funds at the settlement date at the contract rate. So, for example, if the FRA has a contract rate of  $5\%$  for the three-month LIBOR (the reference rate) and the notional amount is for  \$10 million, the buyer is agreeing to pay 5\%$  to buy or borrow 10 million at the settlement date and the seller is agreeing to receive  $5\%$  to sell or lend 10 million at the settlement date.

If at the settlement date, the settlement rate is greater than the contract rate, the FRA buyer benefits, because the buyer can borrow funds at a below-market rate. If the settlement rate is less than the contract rate, this benefits the seller, who can lend funds at an above-market rate. If the settlement rate is the same as the contract rate, neither party benefits. This is summarized as follows:

FRA buyer benefits if Settlement rate  $>$  Contract rate,

FRA seller benefits if Contract rate  $>$  Settlement rate,

Neither party benefits if Settlement rate  $=$  Contract rate.

As with the Eurodollar futures contract, FRAs are cash settlement contracts. At the settlement date, the party that benefits based on the contract rate and settlement rate must be compensated by the other. Assuming the settlement rate is not equal to the contract rate, then

Buyer receives compensation if Settlement rate  $>$  Contract rate, Seller receives compensation if Contract rate  $>$  Settlement rate.

To determine the amount one party must compensate the other, the following is first calculated assuming a 360-day count convention:

If Settlement rate  $>$  Contract rate:

Interest differential  $=$  (Settlement rate - Contract rate)

$\times$  (Days in contract period/360)  $\times$  Notional amount.

If Contract rate  $>$  Settlement rate:

Interest differential = (Contract rate - Settlement rate)

$\times$  (Days in contract period/360)  $\times$  Notional amount.

The amount that must be exchanged at the settlement date is not the interest differential. Instead, the present value of the interest differential is exchanged. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the interest differential is the settlement rate. Thus, the compensation is determined as follows:

Compensation =  $\frac{\text{Interest differential}}{[1 + \text{Settlement rate} \times (\text{Days in contract period} / 360)]}$ .

To illustrate, assume the following terms for an FRA: Reference rate is the three-month LIBOR, the contract rate is  $5\%$ , the notional amount is for \$10 million, and the number of days to settlement is 91 days. Suppose the settlement rate is  $5.5\%$ . In this case, the buyer benefits, because the buyer can borrow at  $5\%$  (the contract rate) when the market rate (the settlement rate) is  $5.5\%$ . The interest differential is

Interest differential  $= (0.055 - 0.05) \times (91 / 360) \times \10,000,000 = \$ 12,638.89.

The compensation or payment that the seller must make to the buyer is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {C o m p e n s a t i o n} = \frac {\mathrm {S 1 2 , 6 3 8 . 8 9}}{[ 1 + 0 . 0 5 5 \times 9 1 / 3 6 0 ]} \\ = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 2 , 6 3 8 . 8 9}{1 . 0 1 3 9 0 2 7} = \mathbb {S} 1 2, 4 6 5. 5 8. \\ \end{array}
$$

It is important to note the difference in who benefits when interest rates move in an FRA and an interest rate futures contract. The buyer of an FRA benefits if the reference rate increases, and the seller benefits if the reference rate decreases. In a futures contract, the buyer benefits from a falling rate, whereas the seller benefits from a rising rate. This is summarized in table 37.1. The different parties benefit under different conditions, because the underlying for each of the two contracts is different. In the case of an FRA, the underlying is a rate. The buyer gains if the rate increases and loses if the rate decreases. In contrast, in a futures contract, the underlying is a fixed-income instrument. The buyer gains if the fixed-income instrument increases in value, which occurs when rates decline. The buyer loses when the fixed-income instrument decreases in value, which occurs when interest rates increase. The opposite occurs for the seller of a futures contract.

# Interest Rate Swaps

An interest rate swap is an agreement whereby two parties (called "counterparties") agree to exchange periodic interest payments. The dollar amount of the interest payments exchanged is based on some predetermined dollar principal, which is called the notional principal amount. The dollar amount each counterparty pays to the other is the agreed-on periodic interest rate times the notional principal amount. The only dollars exchanged between the parties are the net interest payments, not the notional principal amount. In the most common type of swap, one party agrees to pay the other party fixed interest payments at designated dates for the life of the contract. This party is referred to as the fixed-rate payer. The other party, referred to as the floating-rate payer, agrees to make interest rate payments that float with some reference interest rate (or, simply, "reference rate").

For example, suppose that for the next five years, party X agrees to pay party Y 10\% per year, and party Y agrees to pay party X the six-month LIBOR. Party X is a fixed-rate payer/floating-rate receiver, whereas party Y is a floating-rate payer/fixed-rate receiver. Assume that the notional principal amount is \$50 million, and that payments are exchanged every six months for the next five years. Then every six months, party X (the fixed-rate payer/floating-rate receiver) will pay party Y \$2.5 million (10\% times \$50 million divided by 2). The amount that party Y (the floating-rate payer/fixed-rate receiver) will pay party X will be the six-month LIBOR times \$50 million divided by 2. For example, if the six-month LIBOR is 7\%, party Y will pay party X \$1.75 million (7\% times \$50 million divided by 2). Note that we divide by two, because one-half year's interest is being paid.

The reference rates that are commonly used for the floating rate in an interest rate swap are those on various money market instruments: Treasury bills, LIBOR, commercial paper, bankers acceptances, certificates of deposit, federal funds rate, and prime rate.

As we illustrate later, market participants can use an interest rate swap to alter the cash flow character of assets or liabilities from a fixed-rate basis to a floating-rate basis or vice versa.

Risk/Return Characteristics of a Swap

The value of an interest rate swap will fluctuate with market interest rates. To see how, let's analyze our hypothetical swap. Suppose that interest rates change immediately after parties X and Y enter into the swap. First, consider what would happen if the market demanded that the fixed-rate payer must pay  $11\%$  to receive the six-month LIBOR in any five-year swap. If party X (the fixed-rate payer) wants to sell its position, say, to party A, then party A will benefit by only having to pay  $10\%$  (the original swap rate agreed on) rather than  $11\%$  (the current swap rate) to receive the six-month LIBOR.

Party X will want compensation for this benefit. Consequently, the value of party X's position has increased. Thus, if interest rates increase, the fixed-rate payer will realize a profit and the floating-rate payer will realize a loss.

Next, consider what would happen if interest rates decline to, say,  $6\%$ . Now a five-year swap would require the fixed-rate payer to pay  $6\%$  rather than  $10\%$  to receive the six-month LIBOR. If party X wants to sell its position to party B, the latter would demand compensation to take over the position. In other words, if interest rates decline, the fixed-rate payer will realize a loss, whereas the floating-rate payer will realize a profit.

The risk/return profile of the two positions when interest rates change is summarized in table 37.2.

Table 37.2 Risk/return profile of counterparties to an interest rate swap.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Interest Rates Decrease</td><td>Interest Rates Increase</td></tr><tr><td>Floating-rate payer</td><td>Gains</td><td>Loses</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-rate payer</td><td>Loses</td><td>Gains</td></tr></table>

# Interpreting a Swap Position

A swap position can be interpreted in two ways: (1) as a package of forward/futures contracts or (2) as a package of cash flows from buying and selling cash market instruments. We will evaluate both interpretations. Contrast the position of the counterparties in an interest rate swap in table 37.2 to the position of the long and short futures or a forward contract shown in table 37.1. An interest rate futures contract has an underlying fixed-income instrument. An FRA is one in which the underlying is a rate.

Consider first the FRA. As explained in the previous section, the buyer of an FRA gains if the reference rate rises above the contract rate at the settlement date (i.e., the settlement rate is greater than the contract rate) and loses if the reference rate falls below the contract rate at the settlement date (i.e., the settlement rate is less than the contract rate). The opposite is true for the seller of an FRA. Table 37.3 compares the position of the swap parties and the parties to an FRA if rates increase and decrease. Consequently, the buyer of an FRA realizes the same effect as a fixed-rate payer, and the seller of an FRA realizes the same effect as a floating-rate payer.

Table 37.3

Effect of rate changes on interest rate swap counterparties and FRA counterparties.

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Counterparties to</td><td colspan="2">Interest Rates</td></tr><tr><td>Swap</td><td>FRA</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td></tr><tr><td>Floating-rate payer</td><td>Seller</td><td>Gains</td><td>Loses</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-rate payer</td><td>Buyer</td><td>Loses</td><td>Gains</td></tr></table>

A swap can be viewed as a package of FRAs. In fact, an FRA can be viewed as a special case of a swap in which there is only one settlement date.

Now let's compare a swap to a futures or forward contract where the underlying is an interest rate instrument, such as a Eurodollar CD. The long futures position gains if interest rates decline and loses if interest rates rise—this is similar to the risk/return profile for a floating-rate payer. The risk/return profile for a fixed-rate payer is similar to that of the short futures position: a gain if interest rates increase and a loss if interest rates decrease. Table 37.4 compares the counterparty positions for a swap, an FRA, and a forward/futures on a fixed-income instrument when rates change.

Table 37.4

Effect of rate changes on interest rate swap counterparties, FRA counterparties, and futures and forwards on fixed-income instrument counterparties.

<table><tr><td colspan="5">Counterparties to</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Swap</td><td rowspan="2">FRA</td><td rowspan="2">Futures/Forward on Fixed-Income Instrument</td><td colspan="2">Interest Rates</td></tr><tr><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td></tr><tr><td>Floating-rate payer</td><td>Seller</td><td>Buyer</td><td>Gains</td><td>Loses</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-rate payer</td><td>Buyer</td><td>Seller</td><td>Loses</td><td>Gains</td></tr></table>

Consequently, interest rate swaps can be viewed as a package of more basic interest rate control tools, such as forwards. The pricing of an interest rate swap will then depend on the price of a package of forward contracts with the same settlement dates and in which the underlying for the forward contract is the same reference rate.

Although an interest rate swap may be nothing more than a package of forward contracts, several important reasons suggest that it is not a redundant contract. First, the longest maturity of forward or futures contracts does not extend out as far as that of an interest rate swap. In fact, an interest rate swap with a term of 15 years or longer can be obtained. Second, an interest rate swap is a more transactionally efficient instrument. By this we mean that in one transaction, two parties can effectively establish a payoff equivalent to a package of forward contracts. The forward contracts would each have to be negotiated separately. Third, the liquidity of the interest rate swap market has grown since its beginnings in 1981; it is now more liquid than forward contracts, particularly long-dated (that is, long-term) forward contracts.

# Package of Cash Market Instruments

To understand why a swap can also be interpreted as a package of cash market instruments, consider the following. Suppose that an investor enters into a transaction to

- buy 50 million par value of a five-year, floating-rate bond that pays six-month LIBOR every six months, and
- finance the purchase of the five-year, floating-rate bond by borrowing 50 million for five years with a 10\% annual interest rate and payments every six months.

The cash flow of this transaction is presented in table 37.5. The second column of the exhibit sets out the cash flow from purchasing the five-year, floating-rate bond. There is a  \$50 million cash outlay and then cash inflows. The amount of the cash inflows is uncertain, because they depend on future LIBORs. The third column shows the cash flow from borrowing\$ 50 million on a fixed-rate basis. The last column shows the net cash flow from the entire transaction. As can be seen in the last column, there is no initial cash flow (no cash inflow or cash outlay). In all 10 six-month periods, the net position results in a cash inflow of LIBOR and a cash outlay of 2.5 million. This net position, however, is identical to the position of a fixed-rate payer/floating-rate receiver.

Table 37.5 Cash flow for the purchase of a five-year, floating-rate bond financed by borrowing on a fixed-rate basis.

<table><tr><td colspan="4">Transaction: Purchase for \$50 million a five-year, floating-rate bond: floating rate = LIBOR, semiannual pay Borrow \$50 million for five years: fixed rate = 10\% semiannual payments</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Six-Month Period</td><td colspan="3">Cash Flow (in millions of dollars) from:</td></tr><tr><td>Floating-Rate Bond</td><td>Borrowing Cost</td><td>Net</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>-$50.0</td><td>+$50.0</td><td>$.0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>+(LIBOR1/2) × 50</td><td>-2.5</td><td>+(LIBOR1/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>+(LIBOR2/2) × 50</td><td>-2.5</td><td>+(LIBOR2/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>+(LIBOR3/2) × 50</td><td>-2.5</td><td>+(LIBOR3/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>+(LIBOR4/2) × 50</td><td>-2.5</td><td>+(LIBOR4/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>+(LIBOR5/2) × 50</td><td>-2.5</td><td>+(LIBOR5/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>+(LIBOR6/2) × 50</td><td>-2.5</td><td>+(LIBOR6/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>+(LIBOR7/2) × 50</td><td>-2.5</td><td>+(LIBOR7/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>+(LIBOR8/2) × 50</td><td>-2.5</td><td>+(LIBOR8/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>+(LIBOR9/2) × 50</td><td>-2.5</td><td>+(LIBOR9/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>+(LIBOR10/2) × 50 + 50</td><td>-52.5</td><td>+(LIBOR10/2) × 50–2.5</td></tr></table>

Note: The subscript on LIBOR indicates the six-month LIBOR as per the terms of the floating-rate bond at a specific time.

The net cash flow in table 37.5 reveals that a fixed-rate payer has a cash market position that is equivalent to taking a long position in a floating-rate bond and borrowing the funds to purchase the floating-rate bond on a fixed-rate basis. But the borrowing can be viewed as issuing a fixed-rate bond, or equivalently, being short a fixed-rate bond. Consequently, the position of a fixed-rate payer can be viewed as being long a floating-rate bond and short a fixed-rate bond.

What about the position of a floating-rate payer? It can be demonstrated that the position of a floating-rate payer is equivalent to purchasing a fixed-rate bond and financing that purchase at a floating rate, with the floating rate being the reference interest rate for the swap. That is, the position of a floating-rate payer is equivalent to a long position in a fixed-rate bond and a short position in a floating-rate bond.

# Applications

So far we have merely described an interest rate swap and looked at its characteristics. With the help of two illustrations, we now explain how swaps can be used. Although we focus on basic or plain vanilla swaps, the illustrations will help explain why other types of interest rate swaps have been developed.

Application to asset/liability management In the first illustration, we look at how an interest rate swap can be used to alter the cash flow characteristics of an institution's assets so as to provide a better match between assets and liabilities. The two institutions are a commercial bank and a life insurance company.

Suppose a bank has a portfolio consisting of five-year term commercial loans with a fixed interest rate. The principal value of the portfolio is  \$50 million, and the interest rate on all the loans in the portfolio is 10\%$ . The loans are interest only loans; interest is paid semiannually, and the entire principal is paid at the end of five years. That is, assuming no default on the loans, the cash flow from the loan portfolio is 2.5 million every six months for the next five years and 50 million at the end of five years. To fund its loan portfolio, assume that the bank is relying on the issuance of six-month CDs. The interest rate that the bank plans to pay on its six-month CDs is the six-month Treasury bill rate plus 40 basis points (bps).

The risk that the bank faces is that the six-month Treasury bill rate will be  $9.6\%$  or greater. To understand why, remember that the bank is earning  $10\%$  annually on its commercial loan portfolio. If the six-month Treasury bill rate is  $9.6\%$ , it will have to pay  $9.6\%$  plus 40 bps to depositors for six-month funds, or  $10\%$ , and there will be no spread income. Worse, if the six-month Treasury bill rate rises above  $9.6\%$ , there will be a loss; that is, the cost of funds will exceed the interest rate earned on the loan portfolio. The bank's objective is to lock in a spread over the cost of its funds.

The other party in this illustration is a life insurance company that has committed itself to paying a  $9\%$  rate for the next five years on a guaranteed investment contract (GIC) it has issued. The amount of the GIC is \$50 million. Suppose that the life insurance company has the opportunity to invest \$50 million in what it considers an attractive five-year, floating-rate instrument in a private placement transaction. The interest rate on this instrument is the six-month Treasury bill rate plus 160 bps. The coupon rate is set every six months.

The risk that the life insurance company faces is that the six-month interest rate will fall, so that the company will not earn enough to realize a spread over the  $9\%$  rate that it has guaranteed to the GIC holders. If the six-month Treasury bill rate falls to  $7.4\%$  or less, no spread income will be generated. To understand why, suppose that at the date the floating-rate instrument resets its coupon, the six-month Treasury bill rate is  $7.4\%$ . Then the coupon rate for the next six months will be  $9\%$  ( $7.4\%$  plus 160 bps). Because the life insurance company has agreed to pay  $9\%$  on the GIC policy, there will be no spread income. If the six-month Treasury bill rate falls below  $7.4\%$ , then the life insurance company will incur a loss.

We can summarize the asset/liability problem of the bank and life insurance company as follows:

# Bank:

1. Has lent long-term and borrowed short-term;
2. If the six-month Treasury bill rate rises, spread income declines.

# Life insurance company:

3. Has effectively lent short-term and borrowed long-term;
4. If the six-month Treasury bill rate falls, spread income declines.

Now let's suppose that an intermediary offers a five-year interest rate swap with a notional principal amount of 50 million to both the bank and life insurance company. The terms offered to the bank are:

1. Every six months, the bank will pay  $10\%$  (annual rate) to the intermediary.
2. Every six months, the intermediary will pay the six-month Treasury bill rate plus 155 bps to the bank.

The terms offered to the insurance company are:

1. Every six months, the life insurance company will pay the six-month Treasury bill rate plus 160 bps per year to the intermediary.
2. Every six months, the intermediary will pay the insurance company  $10\%$  (annual rate).

What has this interest rate contract done for the bank and the life insurance company? Consider first the bank. For every six-month period during the life of the swap agreement, the interest rate spread will be as follows:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Annual Interest Rate Received:</td></tr><tr><td>From commercial loan portfolio</td><td>= 10\%</td></tr><tr><td>From interest rate swap</td><td>= 6-month T-bill rate + 155 bps.</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>= 11.55\% + 6-month T-bill rate</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Annual Interest Rate Paid:</td></tr><tr><td>To CD depositors</td><td>= 6-month T-bill rate + 40 bps.</td></tr><tr><td>On interest rate swap</td><td>= 10\%</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>= 10.40\% + 6-month T-bill rate</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Outcome:</td></tr><tr><td>To be received</td><td>= 11.55\% + 6-month T-bill rate</td></tr><tr><td>To be paid</td><td>= 10.40\% + 6-month T-bill rate</td></tr><tr><td>Spread income</td><td>= 1.15\% or 115 bps.</td></tr></table>

Thus, regardless of what happens to the six-month Treasury bill rate, the bank locks in a spread of 115 bps.

Now let's look at the effect of the interest rate swap on the life insurance company:

# Annual Interest Rate Received:

<table><tr><td>From floating-rate instrument</td><td>= 6-month T-bill rate + 160 bps</td></tr><tr><td>From interest rate swap</td><td>= 10\%</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>= 11.6\% + 6-month T-bill rate</td></tr><tr><td>Annual Interest Rate Paid:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>To GIC policyholders</td><td>= 9\%</td></tr><tr><td>On interest rate swap</td><td>= 6-month T-bill rate + 160 bps</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>= 10.6\% + 6-month T-bill rate</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>To be received</td><td>= 11.6\% + 6-month T-bill rate</td></tr><tr><td>To be paid</td><td>= 10.6\% + 6-month T-bill rate</td></tr><tr><td>Spread income</td><td>= 1.0\% or 100 bps</td></tr></table>

Regardless of what happens to the six-month Treasury bill rate, the life insurance company locks in a spread of 100 bps.

The interest rate swap has allowed each party to accomplish its asset/liability objective of locking in a spread. The swap permits each financial institution to alter the cash flow characteristics of its assets: from fixed to floating in the case of the bank, and from floating to fixed in the case of the life insurance company. This type of transaction is referred to as an asset swap. The bank and the life insurance company could have used the swap market instead to change the cash flow nature of their liabilities. Such a swap is called a liability swap. Although we used a bank in our illustration, an interest rate swap obviously would be appropriate for savings and loan associations that, because of regulation, borrow short term on a floating-rate basis and lend long term on fixed-rate mortgages.

Of course, the two institutions could have chosen other ways to match the cash flow characteristics of their assets and liabilities. The bank might refuse to make fixed-rate commercial loans and insist only on floating-rate loans. This approach has a major pitfall: If borrowers can find another source willing to lend on a fixed-rate basis, the bank would lose these customers. The life insurance company might refuse to purchase a floating-rate instrument. But suppose that the terms offered on the private placement instrument were more attractive than what would have been offered on a floating-rate instrument of comparable credit risk. Thus, by using the swap market, the life insurance company can earn a yield higher than what it would earn if it had invested directly in a five-year, fixed-rate security. For example, suppose the life insurance company can invest in a comparable credit risk five-year, fixed-rate security with a yield of  $9.8\%$ . Given the funding through the GIC with a  $9\%$  rate, this investment would result in spread income of 80 bps—less than the 100-bp spread income that the life insurance company achieved by purchasing the floating-rate instrument and entering into the swap.

Consequently, an interest rate swap performs two important functions: (1) It can change the risk of a financial position by altering the cash flow characteristics of assets or liabilities, and (2) under certain circumstances, it also can be used to enhance returns. Obviously, this second function arises only if there are market imperfections.

A final point can be made in this illustration. Look at the floating-rate payments that the life insurance company makes to the intermediary and the floating-rate payments that the intermediary makes to the bank. The life insurance company pays the six-month Treasury bill rate plus 160 bps, but the intermediary pays the bank the six-month Treasury bill rate plus only 155 bps. The difference of 5 bps represents the fee to the intermediary for the services of intermediation.

Application to debt issuance Our second illustration considers two U.S. entities, a triple-A rated commercial bank and a triple-B rated nonfinancial corporation: Each wants to raise 100 million for 10 years. For various reasons, the bank wants to raise floating-rate funds, whereas the nonfinancial corporation wants to raise fixed-rate funds. The interest rates available to the two entities in the U.S. bond market are:

Bank: Floating rate = Six-month LIBOR + 30 bps,

Nonfinancial corporation: Fixed rate  $= 12\%$ .

Suppose also that both entities could issue securities in the Eurodollar bond market, if they wanted to. Let us assume that the following terms are available in the Eurodollar bond market for 10-year securities for these two entities:

Bank: Fixed rate = 10.5\%,

Nonfinancial corporation: Floating rate  $=$  Six-month LIBOR + 80 bps.

Notice that we indicate the terms that the bank could obtain on fixed-rate financing and that the nonfinancial corporation could obtain on floating-rate securities. You will shortly see why we did this. First, let us summarize the situation for the two entities in the U.S. domestic and Eurodollar bond markets:

In this table, we use the term quality spread. This term simply means the differential borrowing costs that reflect the difference in the creditworthiness of the two entities.

Notice that the quality spread for floating-rate securities (50 bps) is narrower than the quality spread for fixed-rate securities (150 bps). This difference in spreads provides an opportunity for both entities to reduce the cost of raising funds. To see how, suppose each entity issued securities in the Eurodollar bond market, and then simultaneously entered into the following 10-year interest rate swap with a 100 million notional principal amount offered by an intermediary:

# Bank:

Pay floating rate of 6-month LIBOR + 70 bps

Receive fixed rate of  $11.3\%$

# Nonfinancial Corporation:

Pay fixed rate of  $11.3\%$

Receive floating rate of 6-month LIBOR + 45 bps

# Interest Paid:

On fixed-rate Eurodollar bonds issued  $= 10.5\%$

On interest rate swap = six-month LIBOR + 70 bps

Total  $= 11.2\% +6$  -month LIBOR

# Interest Received:

On interest rate swap  $= 11.3\%$

# Net Cost:

Interest paid  $= 11.2\% +$  six-month LIBOR

Interest received = 11.3\%

Total = six-month LIBOR - 10 bps

# Interest Paid:

On floating-rate Eurodollar bonds issued = six-month LIBOR + 80 bps

On interest rate swap = 11.3\%

Total = 12.1\% + six-month LIBOR

# Interest Received:

On interest rate swap =six-month LIBOR + 45 bps

# Net Cost:

Interest paid  $= 12.1\% +$  six-month LIBOR

Interest received =six-month LIBOR + 45 bps

Total  $= 11.65\%$

The transactions are diagrammed in figure 37.1. By issuing securities in the Eurodollar bond market and using the interest rate swap, both entities are able to reduce their cost of issuing securities. The bank was able to issue floating-rate securities for six-month LIBOR minus 10 bps rather than issue floating-rate securities in the U.S. domestic bond market for six-month LIBOR plus 30 bps, thereby saving 40 bps. The nonfinancial corporation saved 35 bps (11.65\% versus 12\%) by issuing floating-rate bonds in the Eurodollar bond market and using the interest rate swap.

Interest rate swap for debt issuance.

The point of this illustration is to show that, if differences in quality spreads exist in different sectors of the bond markets, borrowers can use the interest rate swap to arbitrage the inconsistency. Whether these differences do exist is another question, which we address below.

Finally, look once again at the intermediary in this transaction. The intermediary pays a floating rate of six-month LIBOR plus 45 bps to the nonfinancial corporation, and it receives six-month LIBOR plus 70 bps from the bank, realizing 25 bps for its intermediary services.

Reasons for the Development of the Interest Rate Swap Market

According to the BIS, the interest rate swap market, which began in late 1981, is the largest component of the OTC interest rate derivatives market. The interest rate swap market has grown rapidly since its inception. What is behind this rapid growth? As our two illustrations have demonstrated, an interest rate swap is a quick way for institutional investors and corporate borrowers to change the nature of assets and liabilities or to exploit any perceived capital market imperfection.

The initial motivation for the interest rate swap market was borrower exploitation of what were perceived to be credit arbitrage opportunities. These opportunities were attributed to the fact that quality spreads (i.e., the difference in yields between lowerand higher-rated credits) were frequently not the same in the fixed-rate market as in the floating-rate market, and often the quality spreads were not the same in the U.S. debt markets as in the Eurodollar bond markets. Note that our second illustration assumes a spread of 50 bps in the floating-rate markets and 150 bps in the fixed-rate markets. Publications by dealer firms and academic research have suggested this credit arbitrage motivation.

Basically, this argument for swaps rested on the well-known economic principle of comparative advantage, which was developed in international economics. The argument takes the following form. Even though a high credit-rated issuer could borrow at a lower cost in both the fixed-rate and floating-rate markets (that is, have an absolute advantage in both), it will have a comparative advantage relative to a lower credit-rated issuer in one of the markets (and a comparative disadvantage in the other). Under these conditions, each borrower could benefit from issuing securities in the market in which it has a comparative advantage and then swapping obligations for the desired type of financing. The swap market developed as the vehicle for swapping obligations.

Several observers have challenged the notion that credit arbitrage opportunities exist. They insist that the comparative advantage argument, although based on arbitrage, does not rely on irrational mispricing but on assumptions of equilibrium in segmented markets. That is, two completely separate markets can be perfectly competitive unto themselves but can set different prices for risk. An economic agent transacting simultaneously in both markets would see an imperfectly competitive market and an opportunity to make money.

Those who challenge the credit arbitrage notion argue that the differences in quality spreads in the fixed-rate and floating-rate markets represent differences in the risks that lenders face in these two markets. Let us consider shortand long-term markets in this regard. The interest rate for a floating-rate note effectively represents a short-term interest rate; therefore, the quality spread on floating-rate notes is a spread in the short-term market. In contrast, the quality spread on fixed-rate mediumand long-term notes represents the spread in that maturity sector. There is no reason for the quality spreads across those two markets to be the same.[5]

Some observers attribute the difference in quality spreads among markets to differences in regulations among countries. Similarly, differences in tax treatment across countries also create differences in the price of risk and in expected returns. Thus, swaps can be used for regulatory or tax arbitrage and may be explained by such differences among national markets.

Finally, another argument suggested for the growth of the interest rate swap market is the increased volatility of interest rates that has led borrowers and lenders to hedge or manage their exposure. Even though risk/return characteristics can be replicated by a package of forward contracts, interest rate forward contracts are not as liquid as interest rate swaps. And entering into or liquidating swap transactions has been facilitated by the standardization of documentation published by the International Swap Dealers Association in early 1987. Moreover, a swap to hedge or manage a position costs less than a package of interest rate forward contracts.

Consequently, we can say that the swap market originally developed for the purpose of exploiting real or perceived imperfections in the capital market, but it eventually evolved into a transactionally efficient market for accomplishing asset/liability objectives.

# Role of the Intermediary

The role of the intermediary in an interest rate swap sheds some light on the evolution of the market. Intermediaries in these transactions have been commercial banks and investment banks, who, in the early stages of the market, sought out end users of swaps. That is, commercial banks and investment banking firms found in their client bases those entities that needed swaps to accomplish funding or investing objectives, and they matched the two entities. In essence, the intermediary in this type of transaction performed the function of a broker.

In the early years of this market, the only time that the intermediary would take the opposite side of a swap (that is, would act as a principal) was when it had to do so to balance out the transaction. For example, if an intermediary had two clients that were willing to do a swap but one wanted the notional principal amount to be \$100 million and the other wanted it to be \$85 million, the intermediary might become the counterparty to the extent of \$15 million. That is, the intermediary would warehouse or take a position as a principal to the transaction to make up the \$15 million difference between the clients' objectives. To protect itself against an adverse interest rate movement, the intermediary would hedge its position.

To explain how the intermediary's role developed over time, we need to address an important feature of the swap that we have not yet discussed. The parties to the swaps we have described had to be concerned that the other party would default on its obligation. Although a default would not mean any principal was lost (because the notional principal amount had not been exchanged), it would mean that the objective for which the swap was entered into would be impaired. As the early transactions involved a higher and a lower credit-rated entity, the former would be concerned with the potential for default of the latter. To reduce the risk of default, many early swap transactions required that the lower credit-rated entity obtain a guarantee from a highly rated commercial bank. Often, the intermediary in the swap was a bank of this type. Involvement as insurer or guarantor in this way led banks to accept the role of dealer or counterparty.

As the frequency and size of the transactions increased, many intermediaries became comfortable with swap transactions and became principals instead of simply acting as brokers. As long as an intermediary had one entity willing to enter into a swap, the intermediary was willing to be the counterparty. Consequently, interest rate swaps became part of an intermediary's inventory of products. Advances in quantitative techniques and futures products for hedging complex positions (such as swaps) made the protection of large inventory positions feasible.

Yet another development encouraged intermediaries to become principals rather than brokers in swaps. As more intermediaries entered the swap market, bid-ask spreads on swaps narrowed sharply. To make money in the swaps market, intermediaries had to do a sufficient volume of business, which was possible only if they had (1) an extensive client base willing to use swaps and (2) a large inventory of swaps. Accomplishing these objectives required the intermediaries to act as principals. A survey by Euromoney asked 150 multinationals and supranationals to identify the characteristics that make a swap house efficient. The results indicated that the speed at which a swap could be arranged for a client was the most important criterion. That speed depends on client base and inventory. The same survey also revealed clients to be less interested in brokered deals than in transactions in which the intermediary is a principal.

# Market Quotes

The convention that has evolved for quoting swaps levels is for a swap dealer to set the floating rate equal to the index and then quote the fixed rate that will apply. To illustrate this convention, we use the swap in our second example of the application of swaps. The terms for that 10-year swap are as follows:

# Bank:

Pay floating rate of 6-month LIBOR + 70 bps.

Receive fixed rate of  $11.3\%$ .

# Nonfinancial Corporation:

Pay fixed rate of  $11.3\%$ .

Receive floating rate of 6-month LIBOR + 45 bps.

The offer price that the dealer would quote to the nonfinancial corporation (the fixed-rate payer) would be to pay  $10.85\%$  and receive LIBOR flat. (The term *flat* means with no spread.) The  $10.85\%$  is obtained by subtracting from the fixed rate of  $11.3\%$  the 45-basis point spread over LIBOR. The bid price that the dealer would quote to the commercial bank would be to pay LIBOR flat and receive  $10.6\%$ . The  $10.6\%$  represents the payment to be received of  $11.3\%$  minus the 70-basis point spread over LIBOR.

The dealer determines or sets the quoted fixed rate by adding some spread to the Treasury yield curve with the same term to maturity as the swap. We refer to this spread as the swap spread. In our illustration, suppose that the 10-year Treasury yield is  $10.35\%$ . In this case, the offer price that the dealer would quote to the fixed-rate payer is the 10-year Treasury rate plus 50 bps versus receiving LIBOR flat. For the floating-rate payer, the bid price quoted would be LIBOR flat versus the 10-year Treasury rate plus 40 bps. In the terminology of the market, the dealer would actually quote this particular swap as "40-50." This swap spread means that the dealer is willing to enter into a swap on either side: to receive LIBOR and pay a fixed rate equal to the 10-year Treasury rate plus 40 bps, or to pay LIBOR and receive a fixed rate equal to the 10-year Treasury rate plus 50 bps. The difference between the fixed rate paid and received is the bid-offer spread, which is 40 bps.

Primary Determinants of Swap Spreads

Earlier we provided two interpretations of a swap: (1) a package of futures/forward contracts, and (2) a package of cash market instruments.[8] The swap spread is defined as the difference between the swap's fixed rate and the rate on a Treasury whose maturity matches the swap's maturity. Although a discussion of the valuation of interest rate swaps is beyond the scope of this chapter, it can be shown that they are valued using no-arbitrage relationships relative to instruments (funding or investment vehicles) that produce the same cash flows under the same circumstances.[9]

The swap spread is determined by the same factors that drive the spread over Treasuries on instruments that replicate a swap's cash flows (i.e., produce a similar return or funding profile). As discussed below, the swap spread's key determinant for swaps with maturities of five years or less is the cost of hedging in the Eurodollar futures market.[10] For swaps with a longer maturity, the swap spread is largely driven by credit spreads in the corporate bond market.[11] Specifically, longer-dated swaps are priced relative to rates paid by investment-grade credits in traditional fixedand floating-rate markets.

Given that a swap is a package of futures and forward contracts, the shorter-term swap spreads respond directly to fluctuations in Eurodollar futures prices. A Eurodollar futures contract is an instrument in which a fixed dollar payment (i.e., the futures price) is exchanged for the threemonth LIBOR. There is a liquid market for Eurodollar futures contracts with maturities every three months for five years. A market participant can create a synthetic fixed-rate security or a fixed-rate funding vehicle of up to five years by taking a position in a bundle of Eurodollar futures contracts (i.e., a position in every three-month Eurodollar futures contract up to the desired maturity date).

For example, consider a financial institution that has fixed-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Both the assets and liabilities have a maturity of three years. The interest rate on the liabilities resets every three months based on the three-month LIBOR. This financial institution can hedge this mismatched asset/liability position by buying a three-year bundle of Eurodollar futures contracts. By doing so, the financial institution is receiving the LIBOR over the three-year period and paying a fixed dollar amount (i.e., the futures price). The financial institution is now hedged, because the assets are fixed rate and the bundle of long Eurodollar futures synthetically creates a fixed-rate funding arrangement. From the fixed dollar amount over the three years, an effective fixed rate that the financial institution pays can be computed. Alternatively, the financial institution can synthetically create a fixed-rate funding arrangement by entering into a three-year swap, in which it pays fixed and receives the three-month LIBOR. Other factors being equal, the financial institution will use the vehicle that delivers the lowest cost of hedging the mismatched position. That is, the financial institution will compare the synthetic fixed rate (expressed as a percentage over U.S. Treasuries) to the three-year swap spread. The difference between the synthetic spread and the swap spread should be within a few basis points under normal circumstances.

Swaps with maturities greater than five years cannot rely on the Eurodollar futures, because liquid markets do not exist for these contracts at longer maturities. Instead, longer-dated swaps are priced using rates available to investment-grade corporate borrowers in fixed-rate and floating-rate debt markets. Because a swap can be interpreted as a package of long and short positions in a fixed-rate bond and a floating-rate bond, it is the credit spreads in those two market sectors that will determine the swap spread. Empirically, the swap rate for a given maturity is greater than the yield on U.S. Treasury securities and less than the yield for AA-rated banks.[12] Swap fixed rates are lower than AA-rated bond yields because of their lower credit, which stems from netting and offsetting of swap positions.

In addition, other technical factors influence the level of swap spreads. Although the impact of some of these factors is ephemeral, their influence can be considerable in the short run. Included among these factors are (1) the level and shape of the Treasury yield curve, (2) the relative supply of fixedand floating-rate payers in the interest rate swap market, (3) the level of asset-based swap activity, and (4) technical factors that affect swap dealers.[13]

Secondary Market for Swaps

Three general types of transactions take place in the secondary market for swaps: a swap reversal, a swap sale (or assignment), and a swap buyback (or close-out or cancellation).

In a swap reversal, the party that wants out of the transaction will arrange for an additional swap in which (1) the maturity on the new swap is equal to the time remaining of the original swap, (2) the reference rate is the same, and (3) the notional principal amount is the same. For example, suppose party X enters into a five-year swap with a notional principal amount of  \$50 million, in which it pays 10\%$  and receives LIBOR, but that two years later, X wants out of the swap. In a swap reversal, X would enter into a three-year interest rate swap with a counterparty different from the original counterparty (let's say Z), in which the notional principal amount is 50 million, and X pays LIBOR and receives a fixed rate. The fixed rate that X receives from Z will depend on prevailing swap terms for floating-rate receivers at the initiation of the three-year swap.

Although party X has effectively terminated the original swap in economic terms, this approach has a major drawback: Party X is still liable to original counterparty Y, as well as to the new counterparty Z. That is, party X now has two offsetting interest rate swaps on its books instead of one, and as a result, it has increased its default risk exposure.

The swap sale or swap assignment overcomes this drawback. In this secondary market transaction, the party that wishes to close out the original swap finds another party that is willing to accept its obligations under the swap. In our illustration, X finds another party (say, A) that will agree to pay  $10\%$  to Y and receive LIBOR from Y for the next three years. Party A might have to be compensated to accept the position of X, or A might be willing to compensate X. Who will receive compensation depends on the swap terms at the time. For example, if interest rates have risen so that, to receive LIBOR for three years, a fixed-rate payer would have to pay  $12\%$ , then A would have to compensate X, because A has to pay only  $10\%$  to receive LIBOR. The compensation would be equal to the present value of a three-year annuity of  $2\%$  times the notional principal amount. If, instead, interest rates have fallen so that, to receive LIBOR for three years, a fixed-rate payer would have to pay  $6\%$ , then X would have to compensate A. The compensation would be equal to the present value of a three-year annuity of  $4\%$  times the notional principal amount. Once the transaction is completed, it is then A, not X, that is obligated to perform under the swap terms. (Of course, an intermediary could act as principal and become party A.)

To accomplish a swap sale, the original counterparty (Y in our example) must agree to the sale. A key factor in whether Y will agree is whether it is willing to accept the credit of A. For example, if A's credit rating is triple B and X's is double A, Y would be unlikely to accept A as a counterparty.

A buyback or close-out sale (or cancellation) involves the sale of the swap to the original counterparty. As in the case of a swap sale, one party might have to compensate the other, depending on how interest rates and credit spreads have changed since the inception of the swap.

Beyond the Plain Vanilla Swap

Thus far we have described the plain vanilla or generic interest rate swap. Nongeneric or individualized swaps have evolved as a result of the asset/liability needs of borrowers and lenders. These include swaps in which the notional principal changes in a predetermined way over the life of the swap and those in which both counterparties pay a floating rate. There are complex swap structures, such as options on swaps (called "swaptions"), and swaps that do not begin until some future time (called "forward start swaps"). We discuss these swaps below. It may be difficult to fully appreciate the importance of these swap structures as a tool for managing the interest rate risk of a financial institution in this book, because of our limited coverage of risk management. What is important to appreciate is that these swap structures are not just "bells and whistles" added to the plain vanilla swap to make them more complicated: They are features that managers need to control interest rate risk.

Swaps that vary the notional principal amount In a generic or plain vanilla swap, the notional principal amount does not vary over the life of the swap. This type of swap is sometimes referred to as a bullet swap. In contrast, for amortizing, accreting, and roller-coaster swaps, the notional principal amount varies over the life of the swap.

An amortizing swap is one in which the notional principal amount decreases in a predetermined way over the life of the swap. Such a swap would be used when the principal of the asset that is being hedged with the swap amortizes over time. For example, in our illustration of the asset/liability problem faced by the bank, the commercial loans are assumed to pay only interest every six months and repay principal at the end of the loan term. However, what if the commercial loan is a typical term loan (that is, a loan that amortizes)? Or, suppose that it is a typical mortgage loan that amortizes. In such circumstances, the outstanding principal for the loans would decline, and the bank would need a swap in which the notional principal amount amortizes in the same way as the loans.

Less common than the amortizing swap are the accreting swap and the roller-coaster swap. An accreting swap is one in which the notional principal amount increases in a predetermined way over time. In a roller-coaster swap, the notional principal amount can rise or fall from period to period.

Basis swaps and constant maturity swaps The terms of a generic interest rate swap call for the exchange of fixedand floating-rate payments. In a basis rate swap, both parties exchange floating-rate payments based on a different reference rate. As an example, assume a commercial bank has a portfolio of loans in which the lending rate is based on the prime rate, but the bank's cost of funds is based on the LIBOR. The risk the bank faces is that the spread between the prime rate and LIBOR will change. This is referred to as "basis risk." The bank can use a basis rate swap to make floating-rate payments based on the prime rate (because that is the reference rate that determines how much the bank is receiving on the loans) and receive floating-rate payments based on the LIBOR (because that is the reference rate that determines the bank's funding cost).

Another popular swap is to have the floating leg tied to a longer-term rate, such as the two-year Treasury note, rather than on a money market rate. For example, one of the parties to the swap would pay the two-year Treasury rate, and the counterparty would pay the LIBOR. Such a swap is called a constant maturity swap. The reference rate for determining the yield on the constant maturity Treasury in a constant maturity swap is typically the Constant Maturity Treasury rate published by the Federal Reserve. Consequently, a constant maturity swap tied to this rate is called a Constant Maturity Treasury swap.

Swaptions Options on interest rate swaps are called swaptions and grant the option buyer the right to enter into an interest rate swap at a future date. The time until expiration of the swap, the term of the swap, and the swap rate are specified. The swap rate is the strike rate for the swaption. The swaption can have any exercise style—American, European, and Bermuda.

There are two types of swaptions—a payer swaption and a receiver swaption. A payer swaption entitles the option buyer to enter into an interest rate swap in which the buyer of the option pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate. For example, suppose that the strike rate is  $7\%$ , the term of the swap is three years, and the swaption expires in two years. Also, assume that it has a European-type exercise provision. Then at the end of two years, the buyer of this swaption has the right to enter into a three-year interest rate swap in which the buyer pays  $7\%$  (the swap rate, which is equal to the strike rate) and receives the reference rate.

In a receiver swaption, the buyer of the swaption has the right to enter into an interest rate swap that requires paying a floating rate and receiving a fixed rate. For example, if the strike rate is  $6.25\%$ , the swap term is five years, and the option expires in one year, the buyer of this receiver swaption has the right when the option expires in one year (assuming it is a European-type exercise provision) to enter into a four-year interest rate swap in which the buyer receives a swap rate of  $6.25\%$  (i.e., the strike rate) and pays the reference rate.

How is a swaption used? We can see its usefulness for managing interest rate risk if we return to the bank-insurance company example. The bank makes fixed-rate payments on the interest rate swap (10\%) using the interest rate it is earning on the commercial loans (10\%). Suppose that the commercial loan borrowers default on their obligations. The bank will not receive from the commercial loans the 10\% to make its swap payments. This problem can be addressed at the outset of the initial swap transaction by the bank entering into a swaption that effectively gives it the right to terminate or cancel the swap. That is, the bank will enter into a receiver swaption, receiving fixed of 10\% so as to offset the fixed rate it is obligated to pay under the initial swap. In fact, the borrowers do not have to fail for the swap to have an adverse impact on the bank. Suppose that the commercial loans can be prepaid. Then the bank has a similar problem to that of having borrowers default. For example, suppose rates on commercial loans decline to 7\% and the borrowers prepay. Then the bank would be obligated to make the 10\% payments under the terms of the swap. With the proceeds received from the prepayment of the commercial loans, the bank may only be able to invest in similar loans at 7\%, for example, a rate that is less than the bank's obligations.

Forward start swaps A forward start swap is a swap wherein the swap does not begin until some future date that is specified in the swap agreement. Thus, the swap has a beginning date at some time in the future and a maturity date. A forward start swap will also specify the swap rate at which the counterparties agree to exchange payments commencing at the start date.

# Interest Rate/Equity Swaps

In addition to interest rate swaps, there are currency and foreign exchange swaps and interest rate/equity swaps. We will discuss the former in chapter 38. Here we explain interest rate/equity swaps.

To illustrate this swap, consider the following swap agreement:

- The counterparties to this swap agreement are the Brotherhood of Basket Weavers (a pension sponsor) and the Reliable Investment Management Corporation (a money management firm).
- The notional principal amount is 50 million.
- Every year for the next five years, the Brotherhood agrees to pay Reliable Investment Management Corporation the return realized on the S&P 500 stock index for the year minus 200 bps.
- Every year for the next five years, Reliable Investment Management Corporation agrees to pay the pension sponsor  $10\%$ .

For example, if over the past year, the return on the S&P 500 stock index is 14\%, then the pension sponsor pays Reliable Investment Management Corporation 12\% (14\% minus 2\%) of \$50 million, or \$6 million, and the money management firm agrees to pay the pension sponsor \$5 million (10\% times \$50 million).

Application to Creation of a Security

Swaps can be used by investment bankers to create a security. To see how this is done, suppose the following. The Universal Information Technology Company (UIT) seeks to raise 100 million for the next five years on a fixed-rate basis. UIT's investment banker, Credit Suisse, indicates that if bonds with a maturity of five years are issued, the interest rate on the issue would have to be 8\%. At the same time, some institutional investors are seeking to purchase bonds but are interested in making a play on the stock market. These investors are willing to purchase a bond whose annual interest rate is based on the actual performance of the S&P 500 stock market index.

Credit Suisse recommends to UIT's management that it consider issuing a five-year bond whose annual interest rate is based on the actual performance of the S&P 500. The risk with issuing such a bond is that UIT's annual interest cost is uncertain, because the cost depends on the performance of the S&P 500. However, suppose that the following two transactions are entered into:

1. On January 1, UIT agrees to issue, using Credit Suisse as the underwriter, a 100 million, five-year bond issue whose annual interest rate is the actual performance of the S&P 500 that year minus 300 bps. The minimum interest rate, however, is set at zero. The annual interest payments are made on December 31.
2. UIT enters into a five-year, 100 million notional principal amount interest rate/equity swap with Credit Suisse in which each year for the next five years, UIT agrees to pay 7.9\% to Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse agrees to pay the actual performance of the S&P 500 that year minus 300 bps. The terms of the swap call for the payments to be made on December 31 of each year. Thus, the swap payments coincide with the payments that must be made on the bond issue. Also, as part of the swap agreement, if the S&P 500 minus 300 bps results in a negative value, Credit Suisse pays nothing to UIT.

Let's look at what has been accomplished with these two transactions from the perspective of UIT. Specifically, focus on the payments that must be made by UIT on the bond issue and the swap, and the payments that it will receive from the swap:

<table><tr><td>Interest payments on bond issue:</td><td>S&amp;P 500 return – 300 bps</td></tr><tr><td>Swap payment from Credit Suisse:</td><td>S&amp;P 500 return + 300 bps</td></tr><tr><td>Swap payment to Credit Suisse:</td><td>7.9\%</td></tr><tr><td>Net interest cost:</td><td>7.9\%</td></tr></table>

Thus, the net interest cost is a fixed rate despite the bond issue paying an interest rate tied to the S&P 500. This transformation was accomplished by using an interest rate/equity swap.

Several questions should be addressed. First, what was the advantage to UIT of entering into this transaction? Recall that if UIT issued a bond, Credit Suisse estimated that UIT would have to pay  $8\%$  annually. Thus, UIT has saved 10 bps ( $8\%$  minus  $7.9\%$ ) per year. Second, why would investors purchase this bond issue? As explained in previous chapters, restrictions are imposed on institutional investors as to types of investment. For example, a depository institution may not be entitled to purchase common stock; however, it may be permitted to purchase a bond of an issuer such as UIT, even though the interest rate is tied to the performance of common stocks.

Third, isn't Credit Suisse exposed to the risk of the performance of the S&P 500? Although it is difficult to demonstrate here, there are ways that Credit Suisse can protect itself.

Although this may seem like a far-fetched application, it is not. In fact, it is quite common. Debt instruments created by using swaps are commonly referred to as "structured notes," which we discussed in chapter 26.

# Interest Rate Caps and Floors

An interest rate cap and floor is an agreement between two parties in which one party, for an upfront premium, agrees to compensate the other if a designated interest rate (called the reference rate) is different from a predetermined level. When one party agrees to pay the other if the reference rate exceeds a predetermined level, the agreement is referred to as an interest rate cap or ceiling. The agreement is referred to as an interest rate floor when one party agrees to pay the other if the reference rate falls below a predetermined level. The predetermined level of the reference interest rate is called the strike rate. The terms of an interest rate agreement include:

1. The reference rate,
2. The strike rate that sets the ceiling or floor,
3. The length of the agreement,
4. The frequency of settlement, and
5. The notional principal amount.

For example, suppose that C buys an interest rate cap from D with terms as follows:

1. The reference rate is the six-month LIBOR.
2. The strike rate is  $8\%$ .
3. The agreement is for seven years.
4. Settlement is every six months.
 5. The notional principal amount is 20 million.

Under this agreement, every six months for the next seven years, D will pay C whenever six-month LIBOR exceeds  $8\%$ . The payment will equal the dollar value of the difference between the six-month LIBOR and  $8 \%$ times the notional principal amount divided by two. For example, if six months from now, the sixmonth LIBOR is  $11 \%$ , then D will pay C  $3 \%$  (11\% minus  $8 \%$  ) times \$20 million divided by 2, or \$300,000. If sixmonth LIBOR is  $8 \%$  or less, D does not have to pay anything to C.

As an example of an interest rate floor, assume the same terms as the interest rate cap we just illustrated. In this case, if the six-month LIBOR is  $11\%$ , C receives nothing from D, but if the six-month LIBOR is less than  $8\%$ , D compensates C for the difference. For example, if the six-month LIBOR is  $7\%$ , D will pay C \$100,000 (8\% minus  $7\%$ , times \$20 million divided by 2).

Interest rate caps and floors can be combined to create an interest rate collar. This is done by buying an interest rate cap and selling an interest rate floor. Some commercial banks and investment banking firms now write options on interest rate agreements for customers. Options on caps are called captions, and options on floors are called flotions.

# Risk/Return Characteristics

In an interest rate cap and floor, the buyer pays an upfront fee, which represents the maximum amount the buyer can lose and the maximum amount the writer of the agreement can gain. The only party that is required to perform is the writer of the interest rate agreement. The buyer of an interest rate cap benefits if the underlying interest rate rises above the strike rate, because the seller (writer) must compensate the buyer. The buyer of an interest rate floor benefits if the interest rate falls below the strike rate, because the seller (writer) must compensate the buyer.

How can we better understand interest rate caps and interest rate floors? In essence, these contracts are equivalent to a package of interest rate options. The question is: What types of options package make up a cap and what types make up a floor? Recall from our earlier discussion of the relationship between futures, FRAs, and swaps that the relationship depends on whether the underlying is an interest rate or a fixed-income instrument. The same applies to call options, put options, caps, and floors.

If the underlying is considered a fixed-income instrument, its value changes inversely with interest rates. Therefore,

For a Call Option on a Fixed-Income Instrument:

1. Interest rates increase  $\rightarrow$  fixed-income instrument's price decreases  $\rightarrow$  call option's value decreases;
2. Interest rates decrease  $\rightarrow$  fixed-income instrument's price increases  $\rightarrow$  call option's value increases.

For a Put Option on a Fixed-Income Instrument:

3. Interest rates increase  $\rightarrow$  fixed-income instrument's price decreases  $\rightarrow$  put option's value increases;
4. Interest rates decrease  $\rightarrow$  fixed-income instrument's price increases  $\rightarrow$  put option's value decreases.

To summarize,

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">When Interest Rates:</td></tr><tr><td>Value of:</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Long call</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td></tr><tr><td>Short call</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Long put</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Short put</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td></tr></table>

For a cap and floor, the situation is as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">When Interest Rates:</td></tr><tr><td>Value of:</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Short cap</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td></tr><tr><td>Long cap</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Short floor</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Long floor</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td></tr></table>

Therefore, buying a cap (long cap) is equivalent to buying a package of puts on a fixed-income instrument, and buying a floor (long floor) is equivalent to buying a package of calls on a fixed-income instrument.

In contrast, if an option is viewed as an option on an interest rate (underlying), then buying a cap (long cap) is equivalent to buying a package of calls on interest rates. Buying a floor (long floor) is equivalent to buying a package of puts on interest rates.

Note that, once again, a complex contract can be seen to be a package of basic contracts, or options in the case of interest rate agreements.

# Applications

To see how interest rate agreements can be used for asset/liability management, consider the problems faced by the commercial bank and the life insurance company in the example discussed earlier in this chapter.

Recall that the bank's objective is to lock in an interest rate spread over its cost of funds. Yet, because it raises funds through a variable-rate instrument and is basically borrowing short term, the bank's cost of funds is uncertain. The bank may be able to purchase a cap so that the cap rate plus the cost of purchasing the cap is less than the rate it is earning on its fixed-rate commercial loans. If short-term rates decline, the bank does not benefit from the cap, but its cost of funds declines. The cap, therefore, allows the bank to impose a ceiling on its cost of funds but retains the opportunity to benefit from a decline in rates. This use of a cap is consistent with the view of an interest rate cap as simply a package of call options.

The bank can reduce the cost of purchasing the cap by also selling a floor. In this case, the bank agrees to pay the buyer of the floor if the underlying rate falls below the strike rate. The bank receives a fee for selling the floor, but it has sold off its opportunity to benefit from a decline in rates below the strike rate. By buying a cap and selling a floor, the bank has created a range (i.e., a collar) for its cost of funds.

Consider again from that same example of the application of interest rate swaps the problem of the life insurance company that has guaranteed a  $9\%$  rate on a GIC for the next five years and is considering the purchase of an attractive floating-rate instrument in a private placement transaction. The risk that the company faces is that interest rates will fall, so that it will not earn enough to realize the  $9\%$  guaranteed rate plus a spread. The life insurance company may be able to purchase a floor to set a lower bound on its investment return, yet retain the opportunity to benefit should rates increase. To reduce the cost of purchasing the floor, the life insurance company can sell an interest rate cap. By doing so, however, it gives up the opportunity of benefiting from an increase in the six-month Treasury bill rate above the strike rate of the interest rate cap.

# Key Points
- A forward rate agreement (FRA) is the OTC equivalent of the exchange-traded futures contracts on short-term rates and is a cash settlement contract in which the short-term reference rate is typically the LIBOR.
- The elements of an FRA are the contract rate, reference rate, settlement rate, notional amount, and settlement date.
- The buyer of the FRA agrees to pay the contract rate and the seller of the FRA agrees to receive the contract rate. The amount that must be exchanged at the settlement date is the present value of the interest differential.
- An interest rate swap is an agreement whereby two counterparties agree to exchange periodic interest payments based on a notional principal amount.
- A position in an interest rate swap can be interpreted as a position in a package of forward contracts or a package of cash flows from buying and selling cash market instruments.
- Although the initial motivation for the swap market was borrower exploitation of what were perceived to be credit arbitrage opportunities, such opportunities are limited and depend on the presence of market imperfections.
- The swap market has evolved into a transactionally efficient market for accomplishing asset/liability objectives to alter the cash flow characteristics of assets (an asset swap) or liabilities (a liability swap).
- Commercial bank and investment banking firms take positions in swaps rather than act simply as intermediaries.
- For swaps with maturities of less than five years, the swap spread is driven by rates in the Eurodollar futures market, but for swaps with maturities greater than five years, the spread is determined primarily by the credit spreads in the corporate bond market.
- In addition to the generic swap structure where one party pays fixed and the other floating, there are swaps with varying notional principal amounts, basis swaps (floating payments made by both parties), constant maturity swaps, swaptions, and forward start swaps.
- An interest rate cap and floor allows one party the right to receive compensation from the writer of the agreement for an upfront premium if a designated interest rate is different from a predetermined level.
- An interest rate cap calls for one party to receive a payment if a designated interest rate is above the predetermined level. An interest rate floor lets one party receive a payment if a designated interest rate is below the predetermined level.
- An interest rate cap can be used to establish a ceiling on the cost of funding; an interest rate floor can be used to establish a minimum return.
- A collar is created by buying an interest rate cap and selling an interest rate floor.
- An interest rate floor can be used by a depository institution to lock in an interest rate spread over its cost of funds but maintain the opportunity to benefit if rates decline.
- The buyer of a floating-rate asset can use an interest rate floor to establish a lower bound on its investment return, yet retain the opportunity to benefit should rates increase.

10. Naturally, this observation presupposes that the reference rate for the swap is LIBOR. Furthermore, part of the swap spread is attributable simply to the fact that LIBOR for a given maturity is higher than the rate of a comparable-maturity U.S. Treasury. For a discussion of non-LIBOR swaps and their valuation, see Buetow and Fabozzi, Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps.
11. The default risk component of a swap spread will be smaller than for a comparable bond credit spread for two reasons. First, because only net interest payments are exchanged rather than both principal and coupon interest payments, the total cash flow at risk is lower. Second, the probability of default depends jointly on the probability of the counterparty defaulting and whether the swap has a positive value. See John C. Hull, Introduction to Futures and Options Markets, 3rd edition (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1998).
