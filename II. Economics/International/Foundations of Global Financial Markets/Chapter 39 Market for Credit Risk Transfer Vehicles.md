The development of the derivatives markets prior to the turn of the twenty-first century provided participants in financial markets with efficient vehicles for the transfer of interest rate, price, and currency risks, as well as for enhancing the liquidity of the underlying assets. However, the market for the efficient transfer of credit risk has developed only recently. As explained in chapter 10, credit risk is the risk that a debt instrument will decline in value as a result of the borrower's inability (real or perceived) to satisfy the contractual terms of its borrowing arrangement. In the case of corporate debt obligations, credit risk encompasses default, credit spread, and rating downgrade risks.

The most obvious way for a financial institution, such as a bank, to transfer the credit risk of a loan it has originated is to sell it to another party. Loan covenants typically require that the borrower be informed of the sale.

The drawback of a sale in the case of bank loans (more specifically, leveraged loans) is the potential impairment of the originating financial institution's relationship with the corporate borrower whose loan is sold. As explained in chapter 26, syndicated loans overcome the drawback of an outright sale, because banks in the syndicate may sell their loan shares in the secondary market. The sale may be through an assignment or through participation. Although the assignment mechanism for a syndicated loan requires the approval of the borrower, participation does not, because the payments are merely passed through to the purchaser and therefore the borrower need not know about the sale.

Another form of credit risk transfer (CRT) vehicle developed in the 1980s is securitization. In a securitization, a financial institution that originates loans and receivables pools them and sells them to a special-purpose vehicle (SPV). The SPV obtains funds to acquire the pool of loans by issuing securities. Payment of interest and principal on the securities issued by the SPV is obtained from the cash flow of the pool of loans. Although the financial institution employing securitization retains some of the credit risk associated with the pool of loans and receivables, as determined by the risk retention requirements described in chapter 27, the majority of the credit risk is transferred to the holders of the securities issued by the SPV.

Two relatively recent CRT vehicles are credit derivatives and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). For financial institutions, credit derivatives, particularly credit default swaps (CDSs), allow the transfer of credit risk to another party without the sale of the loan. A CDO is an application of the securitization technology, but we will explain how it differs from the types of securitization discussed in chapter 27. Credit derivatives can be used to create CRT products. The two most common products employing CDSs are synthetic CDOs and credit-linked notes. In this chapter, we describe all these CRT products: credit derivatives, CDOs, synthetic CDOs, and credit-linked notes.

Although our focus in this chapter is on the transfer of corporate credit risk, credit derivatives and CDOs also have been used to transfer sovereign credit risk and municipal credit risk.

Credit derivatives are used by institutional portfolio managers in the normal course of activities to more efficiently control the credit risk of a portfolio or the balance sheet of a financial institution and to transact more efficiently than by transacting in the cash market. For example, credit derivatives provide a mechanism for portfolio managers to more efficiently short a credit-risky security than by shorting in the cash market, which is often difficult to do. For traders and hedge fund managers, credit derivatives provide a means for leveraging an exposure in the credit market.

Credit derivatives can be characterized in several ways. One such categorization is shown in figure 39.1. Some of the derivatives identified in the figure are not true credit derivatives in that they do not provide protection against credit risk only. Instead, they provide protection against both interest rate risk and credit risk.

Categorization of credit derivatives.

By far the most popular type of credit derivative is the credit default swap (CDS). Not only is this form of credit derivative the most commonly used stand-alone product, it is also used extensively in products known as structured credit products. A CDS is probably the simplest form of CRT vehicle among all credit derivatives, and according to the British Bankers' Association, it is the dominant form of credit derivative. We will look at the different types of CDSs later in the chapter. In this section, we discuss an important market development that fostered the growth of this market: the standardized documentation for the contract.

# ISDA Documentation

Prior to 1998, the development of the credit derivatives market was hindered by the lack of standardization of legal documentation. Every trade (i.e., the buying and selling of a credit derivative contract) had to be customized. In 1998, the International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) developed a standardized contract that could be used by parties to trades of a credit derivatives contract. ISDA documentation is primarily designed for CDSs, but the contract form is sufficiently flexible that it can be used for other types of credit derivatives.

Reference entity and reference obligation The documentation identifies the reference entity and the reference obligation. The reference entity is the issuer of the debt instrument and hence is also referred to as the reference issuer. It could be a corporation or a sovereign government. The reference obligation, also referred to as the reference asset, is the particular debt issue for which the credit protection is being sought. For example, a reference entity could be Ford Motor Credit Company. The reference obligation would be a specific Ford Motor Credit Company bond issue.

Credit events Credit derivative products have a payout that is contingent on a credit event occurring. The ISDA provides definitions of credit events. The 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions (referred to as the "1999 Definitions") provides a list of eight credit events: (1) bankruptcy, (2) credit event on merger, (3) cross acceleration, (4) cross default, (5) downgrade, (6) failure to pay, (7) repudiation/moratorium, and (8) restructuring. These eight event categories attempt to capture every type of situation that could cause the credit quality of the reference entity to deteriorate or the value of the reference obligation to decline.

Bankruptcy is defined as a variety of acts that are associated with bankruptcy or insolvency laws. Failure to pay results when a reference entity fails to make one or more required payments when due. When a reference entity breaches a covenant, it has defaulted on its obligation.

When a default occurs, the obligation becomes due and payable prior to the scheduled due date had the reference entity not defaulted. This is referred to as an obligation acceleration. A reference entity may disaffirm or challenge the validity of its obligation. This is a credit event that is covered by repudiation/moratorium.

The most controversial credit event that may be included in a credit derivative product is restructuring of an obligation. A restructuring occurs when the terms of the obligation are altered so as to make the new terms less attractive to the debtholder than the original terms. The changes would typically include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: (1) a reduction in the interest rate, (2) a reduction in the principal, (3) a rescheduling of the principal repayment schedule (e.g., lengthening the maturity of the obligation) or the postponement of an interest payment, or (4) a change in the level of seniority of the obligation in the reference entity's debt structure.

The reason restructuring is so controversial is that a protection buyer benefits from the inclusion of restructuring as a credit event and feels that eliminating restructuring as a credit event will erode its credit protection. The protection seller, in contrast, would prefer not to include restructuring, because even routine modifications of obligations that occur in lending arrangements would trigger a payout to the protection buyer. Moreover, if the reference obligation is a loan and the protection buyer is the lender, there is a dual benefit for the protection buyer to restructure a loan. The first benefit is that the protection buyer receives a payment from the protection seller. The second benefit is that accommodating restructuring fosters a relationship between the lender (who is the protection buyer) and its customer (the corporate entity that is the obligor of the reference obligation).

Because of this problem, the Restructuring Supplement to the 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions (the "Supplement Definition"), issued in April 2001, provided a modified definition for restructuring. There is a provision for limiting the reference obligations in connection with the restructuring of loans made by the protection buyer to the borrower that is the obligor of the reference obligation. This provision requires the following conditions to qualify for a restructuring: (1) there must be four or more holders of the reference obligation, and (2) there must be a consent to the restructuring of the reference obligation by a supermajority  $(66\%)$ . In addition, the supplement limits the maturity of reference obligations that are physically deliverable when restructuring results in a payout triggered by the protection buyer.

As the credit derivatives market developed, market participants learned a great deal about how to better define credit events, particularly with the record level of high-yield corporate bond default rates in 2002 and the sovereign defaults, especially the experience with the 2001-2002 Argentina debt crisis. In January 2003, the ISDA published its revised credit events definitions in the 2003 ISDA Credit Derivative Definitions. The revised definitions reflected amendments to several of the definitions for credit events set forth in the 1999 Definitions. Specifically, there were amendments for bankruptcy, repudiation, and restructuring.

The major change was to restructuring, whereby the ISDA allows parties to a given trade to select from among the following four definitions: (1) no restructuring, (2) full or old restructuring, which is based on the 1999 Definitions, (3) modified restructuring, which is based on the Supplement Definition, and (4) modified modified restructuring. The last choice is new and was included to address issues that arose in the European market.

# Credit Default Swaps

CDSs are used to shift credit exposure to a credit protection seller. Their primary purpose is to hedge the credit exposure to a particular asset or issuer. A CDS in which there is one reference entity is called a single-name CDS. When there are multiple reference entities (e.g., 10 high-yield corporate bonds of 10 different issuers), it is referred to as a basket CDS. A CDS index has multiple entities, as in a basket CDS. However, unlike a basket CDS, there is a standardized basket of reference entities.

In a CDS, the protection buyer pays a fee to the protection seller in return for the right to receive a payment conditional on the occurrence of a credit event by the reference obligation or the reference entity. Should a credit event occur, the protection seller must make a payment to the protection buyer.

The interdealer market has evolved to where single-name CDSs for corporate and sovereign reference entities are standardized. Although trades between dealers have been standardized, nonetheless, occasional trades in the interdealer market use a customized agreement. For portfolio managers seeking credit protection, dealers are willing to create customized products. The tenor, or length of time of a CDS, is typically five years. Portfolio managers can have a dealer create a tenor equal to the maturity of the reference obligation or construct one for a shorter period to match the manager's investment horizon.

CDSs can be settled in cash or physically. Physical delivery means that if a credit event as defined by the documentation occurs, the reference obligation is delivered by the protection buyer to the protection seller in exchange for a cash payment. Because physical delivery does not rely on obtaining market prices for the reference obligation when determining the amount of the payment in a single-name CDS, this method of delivery is more efficient.

The payment by the credit protection seller if a credit event occurs may be a predetermined fixed amount, or it may be determined by the decline in value of the reference obligation. When the reference entity is a corporate bond or a sovereign bond, the standard single-name CDS is fixed based on a notional amount. When the cash payment is based on the amount of asset value deterioration, this amount is typically determined by a poll of several dealers. If no credit event has occurred by the maturity date of the swap, both sides terminate the swap agreement, and no further obligations are incurred.

The methods used to determine the amount of the payment obligated of the protection seller under the swap agreement can vary greatly. For instance, a CDS can specify the exact amount of payment that will be made at the contract date by the protection seller should a credit event occur. Conversely, the CDS can be structured so that the amount of the swap payment by the seller is determined after the credit event has occurred. Under these circumstances, the amount payable by the protection seller is determined based on the observed prices of similar debt obligations of the reference entity in the market.

In a typical CDS, the protection buyer pays for the protection premium over several settlement dates rather than up front. A standard CDS specifies quarterly payments.

Single-Name CDSs

Let's work through the mechanics of a single-name CDS. Assume that the reference entity is XYX Corporation and the underlying is  $10 million par value of XYZ bonds. The$ 10 million is the notional amount of the contract. The swap premium—the payment made by the protection buyer to the protection seller—is 200 basis points.

The standard contract for a single-name CDS calls for a quarterly payment of the swap premium. The quarterly payment is determined using one of the day count conventions in the bond market. The day count convention used for CDSs is actual/360, the same convention used in the interest rate swap market. A day convention of actual/360 means that to determine the payment in a quarter, the actual number of days in the quarter is used and 360 days are assumed for the year. Consequently, the swap premium payment for a quarter is given by the following:

Quarterly swap premium payment = Notional amount  $\times$  swap rate (in decimal)  $\times$  (Actual no. of days in quarter/360).

For example, assume a hypothetical CDS where the notional amount is 10 million and there are 92 actual days in a quarter. Because the swap premium is 200 basis points (0.02), the quarterly swap premium payment made by the protection buyer would be

$$
\$ 10,000,000 \times (0.02) \times (92 / 360) = \$ 51,111.11.
$$

In the absence of a credit event, the protection buyer will make a quarterly swap premium payment over the life of the swap. If a credit event occurs, two things happen. First, no further payments of the swap premium are made by the protection buyer to the protection seller. Second, a termination value is determined for the swap. The procedure for computing the termination value depends on the settlement terms provided for by the swap. This will be either physical settlement or cash settlement. The market practice for settlement for single-name CDSs is physical delivery.

With physical settlement, the protection buyer delivers a specified amount of the face value of bonds of the reference entity to the protection seller. The protection seller pays the protection buyer the face value of the bonds. Because all reference entities that are the subject of CDSs have many issues outstanding, there will be alternative issues of the reference entity that the protection buyer can deliver to the protection seller. These issues are known as deliverable obligations. The swap documentation will set forth the characteristics necessary for an issue to qualify as a deliverable obligation. Recall that for Treasury bond and note futures contracts, the short has the choice of which Treasury issue to deliver from among those the exchange specifies as acceptable for delivery. The short will select the issue cheapest to deliver, and the choice granted to the short is effectively an embedded option. The same is true for physical settlement of a single-name CDS. From the list of deliverable obligations, the protection buyer will select for delivery to the protection seller the cheapest-to-deliver issue.

Figure 39.2 shows the mechanics of a single-name CDS. The cash flows are shown before and after a credit event occurs. It is assumed in the figure that there is physical settlement.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/f9e2019c-3d5c-44b5-bba3-9b7de83643f5/53ae15ec63a1c27db03ec9a44bcea97f9c30cfddb8c29b1f7b2127f782a22e53.jpg)

Figure 39.2 Mechanics of a single-name credit default swap with physical delivery.

Single-name CDSs can be used in the following ways by portfolio managers:

- The liquidity of the swap market compared to the corporate bond market makes it more efficient to obtain exposure to a reference entity by taking a position in the swap market rather than in the cash market. To obtain exposure to a reference entity, a portfolio manager would sell protection and thereby receive the swap premium.
- Conditions in the corporate bond market may be such that it is difficult for a portfolio manager to sell the current holding of a corporate bond of an issuer for which it has a credit concern. Rather than selling the current holding, the portfolio manager can buy protection in the swap market.
- If a portfolio manager expects that an issuer will have difficulties in the future and wants to take a position based on that expectation, it will short the bond of that issuer. However, shorting bonds in the corporate bond market is difficult. The equivalent position can be obtained by entering into a swap as the protection buyer.
- A portfolio manager seeking a leveraged position in a corporate bond can do this in the swap market. The economic position of a protection buyer is equivalent to a leveraged position in a corporate bond.

# Basket CDSs

With a basket CDS, or simply "basket default swaps," the time when a payout must be made needs to be specified. For example, if a basket credit default swap has 10 reference obligations, does a credit event for just one of the 10 reference obligations result in the triggering of a payment by the protection seller? It depends. Basket default swaps can be structured in different ways.

In the simplest case, if any one of the reference obligations defaults, there is a payout and then termination of the swap. This type of swap is referred to as a first-to-default basket swap. Similarly, if a payout is triggered only after two reference obligations default, the swap is referred to as a second-to-default basket swap. In general, if it takes  $k$  reference obligations to trigger a payout, the swap is referred to as a  $k$ -to-default basket swap.

Unlike that for a single-name CDS, the preferred settlement term for a basket CDS is cash settlement. With cash settlement, the termination value is equal to the difference between the nominal amount of the reference obligation for which a credit event has occurred and its market value at the time of the credit event. The termination value is then the amount of the payment made by the protection seller to the protection buyer. No bonds are delivered by the protection buyer to the protection seller. The documentation for the basket CDS will set forth how the market value at the time of the credit event is determined.

# CDS Index

In a CDS index, the credit risk of a standardized basket of reference entities is transferred between the protection buyer and protection seller. For North America, the only standardized indexes are those compiled and managed by Dow Jones. For the corporate bond indexes, there are separate indexes for investment-grade and high-grade names. The most actively traded contract is the one based on the North American Investment Grade Index (denoted by DJ.CDX.NA.IG). As the name suggests, the reference entities in this index are those with an investment-grade rating. The index includes 125 corporate names in North America. The index is an equally weighted index. That is, each corporate name (i.e., reference entity) in the index has a weight of  $0.8\%$ . The index is updated semiannually by Dow Jones.

The mechanics of a CDS index are slightly different from those of a single-name CDS. As with a single-name CDS, a swap premium is paid. However, if a credit event occurs, the swap premium payment ceases in the case of a single-name CDS. In contrast, for a CDS index, the swap payment continues to be made by the protection buyer. However, the amount of the quarterly swap premium payment is reduced. This is because the notional amount is reduced as a result of a credit event for a reference entity.

For example, suppose that a portfolio manager is the protection buyer for a DJ.CDX.NA.IG, and the notional amount is 200 million. Using the following formula for computing the quarterly swap premium payment, the payment before a credit event occurs would be:

$200,000,000 \times$  Swap rate (in decimal)  $\times$  (Actual no. of days in quarter/360).

After a credit event occurs for one reference entity, the notional amount declines from  $200 million to$ 199,840,000. The new notional amount is equal to 99.2\% of the 200 million, because each reference entity for the DJ.CDX.NA.IG is weighted by 0.8\%. Thus, the revised quarterly swap premium payment until the maturity date or until another credit event occurs for one of the other 124 reference entities is

$199,840,000 \times \text{Swap rate (in decimal)} \times (\text{Actual no. of days in quarter/360}).$

As of this writing, the settlement term for a CDS index is physical settlement. However, the market is considering moving to cash settlement. The reason is because of the cost of delivering an odd lot of the bonds of the reference entity in the case of a credit event. For example, in our hypothetical CDS index, if a credit event occurs, the protection buyer would have to deliver to the protection seller bonds of the reference entity with a face value of 160,000. Neither the protection buyer nor the protection seller would like to deal with such a small position.

Figure 39.3 shows the cash flow for a generic CDS index after a credit event for one reference entity.

Figure 39.3

Mechanics of a credit default swap index with physical delivery.

Because a CDS index, such as the DJ.CDX.NA.IG, provides exposure to a diversified basket of credits, it can be used by a portfolio manager to help adjust a portfolio's exposure to the credit sector of a bond market index. By entering into a CDS index as the protection seller, a portfolio manager increases exposure to the credit sector. Exposure to the credit sector is reduced by a portfolio manager being the protection buyer.

# Collateralized Debt Obligations

A collateralized debt obligation is a security backed by a diversified pool of one or more of the following types of debt obligations:

U.S. domestic investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds,

U.S. domestic bank loans,

- emerging market bonds,
- special situation loans and distressed debt,
- foreign bank loans,
- asset-backed securities, and
- residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities.

When the underlying pool of debt obligations consists of bond-type instruments (corporate and emerging market bonds), a CDO is referred to as a collateralized bond obligation. When the underlying pool of debt obligations is bank loans, a CDO is referred to as a collateralized loan obligation (CLO).

A CDO is an important CRT vehicle used by financial institutions and portfolio managers. In this section, we explain the basic CDO structure, the reason CDOs are created, and the types of CDOs. The creation of these structures requires the use of derivative instruments, specifically, interest rate swaps (covered in chapter 37) or CDSs (particularly those discussed earlier in this chapter).

After the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, which started in the summer of 2007, and the global credit crunch that followed, CDO performance, particularly of CDOs that invested in nonagency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs), led to considerable losses by investors. According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, in 2007 the global issuance of CDOs was $482 billion. By January 2009, participants in the CDO market had written down $218 billion in losses from their holdings of CDOs that were backed by asset-backed securities (ABSs). As a result, global CDO issuance in 2009 fell by about 99\% from its 2007 level, to only 4 billion. However, because of the low interest rate environment since 2007 and the potential to invest in better-structured CDO deals, by early 2013, institutional investors showed renewed interest in CDOs that invested in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs). For example, an issuance of a CDO backed by a diversified portfolio of CMBS took place in January 2013, the first such offering since the credit crunch that began in 2008. Unlike CDOs backed by nonagency RMBSs and CMBSs, there were offerings in Close. CDOs are now subject to the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which we described earlier in this book.

# Structure of a CDO

In a CDO structure, a collateral manager is responsible for managing the portfolio of debt obligations. The portfolio of debt obligations in which the collateral manager invests is referred to as the "collateral." The individual issues held that make up the collateral are referred to as the "collateral assets."

The funds to purchase the collateral assets are obtained from the issuance of debt obligations. These debt obligations are referred to as "tranches" or "bond classes." The tranches include senior tranches, possibly mezzanine tranches, and subordinated/equity tranches.

A rating will be sought for all but the subordinate/equity tranche. For the senior tranches, at least an A rating is typically sought. For the mezzanine tranches, a rating of BBB, but no less than B, is sought. The subordinated/equity tranche receives the residual cash flow; hence, no rating is sought for this tranche. There are restrictions imposed on what the collateral manager may do, and certain tests must be satisfied for the CDO to maintain the credit rating assigned at the time of issuance.

The ability of the collateral manager to make the interest payments to the tranches and to pay off the tranches as they mature depends on the performance of the collateral. The proceeds to meet the obligations to the CDO tranches (interest and principal repayment) can come from the following: (1) coupon interest payments from the collateral assets, (2) maturing of collateral assets, or (3) the sale of collateral assets.

In a typical structure, one or more of the tranches has a floating rate. With the exception of deals backed by bank loans that pay a floating rate, the collateral manager invests in fixed-rate bonds. Now, that presents a problem — paying tranche investors a floating rate and investing in assets with a fixed rate. To deal with this problem, the collateral manager uses interest rate swaps to be able to convert a portion of the fixed-rate payments from the assets into floating-rate cash flows to pay floating-rate tranches. As explained in chapter 37, an interest rate swap allows a market participant to swap fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments or vice versa. A credit rating agency (CRA) will require the use of swaps to eliminate any cash flow mismatches.

CDOs are categorized based on the motivation of the sponsor of the transaction. If the sponsor's motivation is to earn the spread between the yield offered on the collateral and the payments made to the various tranches in the structure, then the transaction is referred to as an arbitrage transaction. If the motivation of the sponsor is to remove debt instruments (primarily loans) from its balance sheet, then the transaction is referred to as a balance sheet transaction. Sponsors of balance sheet transactions are typically financial institutions (such as banks) seeking to reduce their capital requirements specified by bank regulators by removing loans from their balance sheet.

# Future of CDO Products

As noted earlier, participants in the CDO market have realized significant losses. A study by the CRA Fitch found that a little more than half the value of the CDOs that were issued throughout the world from 2000 to 2011 has been or will eventually be lost. Most disconcerting was that a large portion of the losses was realized on bond classes that carried a triple-A credit rating

(i.e., the highest investment-grade rating). Because of investors' loss of confidence in this product, global CDO issuance has declined dramatically. So the question that is being asked is whether the CDO market will recover and remain a tool for CRT by financial institutions.

Some believe that despite the adverse publicity, the CDO market received as a result of the losses, CDOs are not an inherently flawed financial instrument, and market participants have learned their lesson when participating in the CDO market. As noted by Kent Smetters, a professor at the Wharton School, in an interview published on April 19, 2013:

CDOs and Close (collateralized loan obligations) are not going to go away, because in principle they are powerful risk management devices. They allow for diversifying of risk that otherwise would be quite concentrated…. But during the crisis, CDOs were being created for their own sake…. The motivation was not risk management. Now, CDOs are more in tune with their actual purpose, which is "risk diversification," not risk amplification.

As for what investors learned, Smetters stated in the interview, "The hope now is that there are going to be smarter and more informed buyers out there."

The CRAs have been attacked for failing to properly assess the credit risks associated with CDOs, particularly those backed by subprime RMBSs. Critics of CRAs argue that these commercial enterprises had an economic interest in providing higher ratings than warranted to drum up business for the rating of future CDOs issued. One of the problems during the crisis is that investors failed to understand that credit ratings are opinions that provide an initial screening for CDO creditworthiness, not the sole metric to be used for selecting CDOs in which to invest. Hopefully, that lesson has been learned. CDOs offer institutional investors the opportunity to earn attractive returns, but suitable credit analysis must be performed by investors beyond sole reliance on a CDO's credit rating.

The Dodd-Frank Act should also provide some comfort to investors. CDOs are subject to the risk retention rules. This means that unlike the CDOs issued prior to the act, CDO sponsors must accept exposure to CDOs, and that exposure cannot directly or indirectly be hedged away.

Finally, it should be remembered that CDOs are backed by different types of collateral. The CDOs that caused the major losses were those backed by private-label RMBSs. Most market observers believe that this sector of the

CDO market is not likely to be revived in the near future. Instead, other sectors, such as CDOs backed by CMBSs, will be viable, as deals are more carefully underwritten.

# Credit-Linked Notes

A credit-linked note (CLN) is a security issued by an investment banking firm or another issuer (typically an SPV) that has credit risk to a second issuer (called the "reference issuer"), and the return is linked to the credit performance of the reference issuer. Embedded in a CLN is a credit derivative, typically a CDS.

A CLN can be quite complicated, so we will focus on the basic structure only. The issuer of a CLN is the credit protection buyer; the investor in the CLN is the credit protection seller. The basic CLN is just like a standard bond: It has a coupon rate (fixed or floating), a maturity date, and a maturity value. However, in contrast to a standard bond, the maturity value depends on the performance of the reference issuer. Specifically, if a credit event occurs with respect to the reference issuer, then (1) the bond is paid off, and (2) the maturity value is adjusted down. How the adjustment is made is described in the prospectus. The compensation for the investor accepting the credit risk of the reference issuer is an enhanced coupon payment.

Typically, CLNs have a maturity of anywhere from three months to several years, with one to three years being the most likely term of credit exposure. The short maturity of CLNs reflects the desire of investors to take a credit view for such a time period.

# Concerns about CRT Vehicles

As with any new complex financial product introduced by financial institutions, there are regulatory and supervisory concerns. The introduction of CRT vehicles, such as cash CDOs and credit derivatives that are employed to create synthetic CDOs, has elicited the same cautious response from overseers of the global banking system. Many of these concerns are the same as those identified for other derivatives, such as interest rate and equity derivatives, and securitized products, such as ABSs, RMBSs, and CMBSs.

Prior to the 2007 crisis, five studies had identified regulatory and supervisory concerns with CRT vehicles, such as credit derivatives and CDOs. The first is a study by the Financial Stability Forum of the Joint Forum (the Joint Forum). The Joint Forum consists of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. The second study was conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) and was a market survey based on interviews with more than 100 banks from 15 EU banks, five large internationally active non-EU banks, and securities houses operating in London. The last three studies are by CRAs, two by Fitch Ratings and one by Standard & Poor's. From the five studies, the following four general issues were identified:

- the transfer of risk may not be clean,
- market participants may fail to understand the associated risks,
- the concentration of risk is potentially high, and
- adverse selection may occur.

We discuss each below.

Transfer of Risk May Not Be Clean

As CRTs have developed, increasing the market liquidity for corporate debt (such as bonds and bank loans), the nature of the risks faced by market participants has changed in several ways. At one time, the focus of an investor in a corporate debt was on the ability of the corporation to meet its obligations. The issue with new CRTs is whether a "clean" transfer of credit risk takes place.

There are concerns with credit derivatives, and therefore with synthetic CDOs being used as CRT vehicles. First is a concern about counterparty risk—the failure of the counterparty selling credit protection would result in the buyer of credit protection maintaining the credit exposure that it thought it had eliminated. With respect to this concern, studies have noted that standard procedures are available in risk management that can be employed to reduce counterparty risk. These risk management tools are equally applicable to over-the-counter derivatives used to manage interest rate and currency risk by regulated financial entities.

Second, although the development of standard documentation for credit derivative trades by the ISDA fostered the growth of that market, there remains a concern about legal risks that may arise from a transaction. The legal risk is the risk that a credit derivative contract will not be enforceable or legally binding on the counterparty to the trade or may contain ambiguous provisions that result in a failure of the contract to fulfill its intent. The most prominent example is what the credit derivatives market faced early in its life dealing with the issue of whether a credit event had occurred and, in particular, with controversial credit events, such as restructuring. The 2004 survey of financial institutions by Fitch investigated the frequency of disputed credit events and found that about  $14\%$  of the credit events captured in the survey were reported to have involved some form of dispute. As for the resolution of those disputes, Fitch found that at the time, nearly all had been or were being resolved without the involvement of the court system. Another example of legal risk is whether the counterparty has the authority to enter into a credit derivative transaction. This is not unique to credit derivatives but has been the subject of litigation in other derivatives markets. For example, interest rate swaps between various dealers and local U.K. authorities were voided in 1991, because it was ruled that the latter did not have the legal authority to enter into the contracts in the first place.

# Market Participants May Fail to Understand the Risks

The development of any market vehicle raises concerns that market participants will not understand the associated risks. For example, evidence in the interest rate swap market suggests that corporate entities failed to understand these risks; the two best-known legal cases are probably those of Gibson Greetings and Procter & Gamble. The same is true for collateralized mortgage obligations. Both instruments have been important financial innovations, but some users/investors experienced financial difficulties or fiascoes, because product innovation may have run far ahead of product education.

In the case of a financial institution that seeks to make a market in CRT vehicles, the concern is that when selling more complex products, such as CDOs, they may not be properly hedging their positions and may therefore be increasing the institution's risk. There is modeling risk. For example, in the case of a single-tranche CDO, the dealer will have an imbalanced position in CDSs and will try to hedge that position by hedging.[11] The risk is that the dealer has not hedged properly.

With respect to this issue, the recommendations of the report of the Joint Forum concentrated on the need for market participants to continue "improving risk management capabilities and for supervisors and regulators to continue improving their understanding of the associated issues." Given this focus, the report sets forth recommendations for market participants and supervisors in three areas: risk management, disclosure, and supervisory approaches, with particular emphasis on reporting and disclosure.

Concentration of Risk Is Potentially High

A CRT vehicle can result in the transfer of credit risk either from one bank to another or from a bank to a nonbank entity. In the banking system, the concern is whether credit risk has become too concentrated. For credit risk transferred out of the banking system, there is concern over the extent to which credit risk is being transferred to nonbanks, such as monoline or multiline insurance companies and hedge funds. The overall concern is with the impact on the financial system resulting from a failure of one or a few major participants in the CRT market.

The two studies by Fitch Ratings reported the number of banks (North American and European) and insurance companies active in the CRT market and the relative size of each. In its 2003 market survey, Fitch surveyed about 200 financial institutions (banks, securities firms, and insurance companies), focusing on those it classified as protection sellers. Fitch found that through credit derivatives, the global banking system transferred U.S. $229 billion of credit risk outside the banking system. Most of this was to the insurance industry (monoline insurance companies/financial guarantors, reinsurance, and insurance companies). The insurance industry itself is the largest seller of credit protection. Fitch estimated that the insurance industry sold $381 billion of net credit protection (i.e., credit protection sold less credit protection purchased). Of that amount, insurance companies provided  $303 billion in credit protection through the credit derivatives market and the balance,$ 78 billion, in credit protection through their participation in the cash CDO market. In the insurance industry, the largest seller of credit protection is financial guarantors, insuring the senior tranches in synthetic CDO deals. Fitch concluded that bank buying of credit protection through credit derivatives has resulted in considerable improvement in secondary credit market liquidity which, in turn, allows market participants to efficiently transfer risk to other sectors of the financial market that lack the ability to originate credit. There was a relatively high concentration of credit protection buying by larger, more sophisticated banks. Smaller and regional banks were net sellers of credit protection, even though banks were net buyers of credit protection in the aggregate.

With respect to counterparty concentration, Fitch reported that the market was concentrated among the top 10 global banks and broker-dealers. Although having investment-grade ratings, the risk is that the withdrawal of one or more of these firms from the market for financial or strategic reasons could undermine the confidence in the CRT market. This was one of the major concerns of the Federal Reserve in early 2008 when justifying the bailout of the investment banking firm Bear Stearns.

In its 2003 survey, Fitch attempted to collect information on hedge fund activities by writing to the 50 largest hedge funds in the world. None responded. In its 2004 survey, Fitch included questions for the major intermediaries as to their dealings with hedge funds. Fitch found that hedge funds represented  $20\%$  to  $30\%$  of their overall CDS index trading. Ultimately, counterparty risk exposure to hedge funds depends on the extent of the collateralization of the trades. Although most of the intermediaries in the survey responded that their positions with hedge funds were fully collateralized, some stated that it was less than  $100\%$  collateralized.

Fitch also found a high concentration in the corporations that were the reference obligations in CDSs. Settlement problems could occur if one of these reference entities experienced a credit event, leading to a major market disruption. Moreover, because of the higher correlation of default that exists for counterparties and corporate references in the CRT market compared with other derivative markets, there is a concern about the market facing multiple defaults. The ECB report concluded that the potential for disruption of the new CRT vehicles was generally small.

Adverse Selection May Occur

The ability of originators to transfer credit risk through credit derivatives, CDOs, or securitization has raised concerns that a lending culture based on origination volume rather than prudent lending practices may be inadvertently adopted by banks. This is a concern about securitization in general that we described in chapter 11 and that the Dodd-Frank Act sought to address with its risk retention rules.

# Key Points
- Credit derivatives can be used to alter the credit risk exposure of a balance sheet, individual security, or a portfolio.
- The ISDA has standardized documentation for credit derivative contracts, and the documents define potential credit events.
- The most controversial credit event is restructuring.
- The credit risk transfer (CRT) market makes it possible to transfer large amounts of corporate credit risk exposure among banks, as well as from the financial sector to the nonfinancial sector through credit derivatives and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).
- By far the most dominant type of credit derivative is the credit default swap (CDS), in which the protection buyer makes a payment of the swap premium to the protection seller; however, the protection buyer receives a payment from the protection seller only if a credit event occurs.
- There are single-name CDSs, basket CDSs, and CDS indexes.
- A CDO is a security backed by a diversified pool of one or more debt obligations.
- A CDO in which the collateral assets are bond-type instruments is called a "collateralized bond obligation." A collateralized loan obligation is a CDO in which the collateral assets are bank loans.
- A CDO uses securitization technology to create different bond classes with different degrees of credit risk.
- A collateral manager is responsible for managing the collateral, subject to restrictions imposed regarding the composition of the collateral.
- There are CDOs backed by nonagency RMBSs and CMBSs. The dismal performance of the CDOs backed by the former type of collateral since 2007 has resulted in a major decline in the global offering of CDOs.
- CDO sponsors must comply with rules of securitization set forth in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
- The funds to purchase collateral assets come from the issuance of debt obligations. These debt obligations include senior tranches, mezzanine tranches, and a subordinate/equity tranche.
- The ability of the collateral manager to make the interest payments to the tranches and pay off the tranches as they mature depends on the performance of the collateral selected.
- CDOs are categorized as either arbitrage transactions or balance sheet transactions, the categorization depending on the motivation of the transaction's sponsor.
- In an arbitrage transaction, the sponsor seeks to earn the spread between the yield offered on the collateral assets and the payments made to the various tranches in the structure.
- In a balance sheet transaction, the sponsor's motivation is to remove debt instruments from its balance sheet.
- Interest rate swaps are often used in CDO structures because of the mismatch between the characteristics of the collateral cash flow and some of the liabilities.
- One variety of CDO is the synthetic CDO, in which credit risk exposure is transferred through credit risk transfer rather than by transferring ownership of CDOs.
- CDSs can be embedded in a bond structure to create a credit-linked note.
- Regulators have raised concerns regarding CDOs and CDSs. These concerns include the clean transfer of risk, the failure of market participants to understand the associated risks, a potentially high concentration of risk, and adverse selection.
