# MONEY, INTEREST RATES, AND EXCHANGE RATES

Chapter 14 showed how the exchange rate between currencies depends on two factors—the interest that can be earned on deposits of those currencies and the expected future exchange rate. To understand fully the determination of exchange rates, however, we have to learn how interest rates themselves are determined and how expectations of future exchange rates are formed. In this and the next two chapters, we examine these topics by building an economic model that links exchange rates, interest rates, and other important macroeconomic variables such as the inflation rate and output.

The first step in building the model is to explain the effects of a country's money supply and of the demand for its money on its interest rate and exchange rate. Because exchange rates are the relative prices of national monies, factors that affect a country's money supply or demand are among the most powerful determinants of its currency's exchange rate against foreign currencies. It is therefore natural to begin a deeper study of exchange rate determination with a discussion of money supply and money demand.

Monetary developments influence the exchange rate by changing both interest rates and people's expectations about future exchange rates. Expectations about future exchange rates are closely connected with expectations about the future money prices of countries' products; these price movements, in turn, depend on changes in money supply and demand. In examining monetary influences on the exchange rate, we therefore look at how monetary factors influence output prices along with interest rates. Expectations of future exchange rates depend on many factors other than money, however, and these nonmonetary factors are taken up in the next chapter.

Once the theories and determinants of money supply and demand are laid out, we use them to examine how equilibrium interest rates are determined by the equality of money supply and money demand. Then we combine our model of interest rate determination with the interest parity condition to study the effects of monetary shifts on the exchange rate, given the prices of goods and services, the level of output, and market expectations about the future. Finally, we take a first look at the long-term effects of monetary changes on output prices and expected future exchange rates.

# LEARNING GOALS

After reading this chapter, you will be able to:

- Describe and discuss the national money markets in which interest rates are determined.
Show how monetary policy and interest rates feed into the foreign exchange market.
- Distinguish between the economy's long-run position and the short run, in which money prices and wages are sticky.
- Explain how price levels and exchange rates respond to monetary factors in the long run.
- Outline the relationship between the short-run and the long-run effects of monetary policy and explain the concept of short-run exchange rate overshooting.

# Money Defined: A Brief Review

We are so accustomed to using money that we seldom notice the roles it plays in almost all of our everyday transactions. As with many other modern conveniences, we take money for granted until something goes wrong with it! In fact, the easiest way to appreciate the importance of money is to imagine what economic life would be like without it.

In this section, we do just that. Our purpose in carrying out this "thought experiment" is to distinguish money from other assets and to describe the characteristics of money that lead people to hold it. These characteristics are central to an analysis of the demand for money.

# Money as a Medium of Exchange

The most important function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, a generally accepted means of payment. To see why a medium of exchange is necessary, imagine how time-consuming it would be for people to purchase goods and services in a world where the only type of trade possible is barter trade—the direct trade of goods or services for other goods or services. To have her car repaired, for example, your professor would have to find a mechanic in need of economics lessons!

Money eliminates the enormous search costs connected with a barter system because money is universally acceptable. It eliminates these search costs by enabling an individual to sell the goods and services she produces to people other than the producers of the goods and services she wishes to consume. A complex modern economy would cease functioning without some standardized and convenient means of payment.

# Money as a Unit of Account

Money's second important role is as a unit of account, that is, as a widely recognized measure of value. It is in this role that we encountered money in Chapter 14: Prices of goods, services, and assets are typically expressed in terms of money. Exchange rates allow us to translate different countries' money prices into comparable terms.

The convention of quoting prices in money terms simplifies economic calculations by making it easy to compare the prices of different commodities. The international

price comparisons in Chapter 14, which used exchange rates to compare the prices of different countries' outputs, are similar to the calculations you would have to do many times each day if different commodities' prices were not expressed in terms of a standardized unit of account. If the calculations in Chapter 14 gave you a headache, imagine what it would be like to have to calculate the relative prices of each good and service you consume in terms of several other goods and services—for example, the price of a slice of pizza in terms of bananas. This thought experiment should give you a keener appreciation of using money as a unit of account.

# Money as a Store of Value

Because money can be used to transfer purchasing power from the present into the future, it is also an asset, or a store of value. This attribute is essential for any medium of exchange because no one would be willing to accept it in payment if its value in terms of goods and services evaporated immediately.

Money's usefulness as a medium of exchange, however, automatically makes it the most liquid of all assets. As you will recall from the previous chapter, an asset is said to be liquid when it can be transformed into goods and services rapidly and without high transaction costs, such as brokers' fees. Since money is readily acceptable as a means of payment, money sets the standard against which the liquidity of other assets is judged.

# What Is Money?

Currency and bank deposits on which checks may be written certainly qualify as money. These are widely accepted means of payment that can be transferred between owners at low cost. Households and firms hold currency and checking deposits as a convenient way of financing routine transactions as they arise. Assets such as real estate do not qualify as money because, unlike currency and checking deposits, they lack the essential property of liquidity.

When we speak in this book of the money supply, we are referring to the monetary aggregate the Federal Reserve calls M1, that is, the total amount of currency and checking deposits held by households and firms. In the United States in the last quarter of 2019, the total money supply amounted to \(3.9 trillion, equal to roughly 19 percent of that year's GNP.\(^{1}\)

The large deposits traded by participants in the foreign exchange market are not considered part of the money supply. These deposits are less liquid than money and are not used to finance routine transactions.

# How the Money Supply Is Determined

An economy's money supply is controlled by its central bank. The central bank directly regulates the amount of currency in existence and also has indirect control over the amount of checking deposits issued by private banks. The procedures

through which the central bank controls the money supply are complex, and we assume for now that the central bank simply sets the size of the money supply at the level it desires. We go into the money supply process in more detail, however, in Chapter 18.

# The Demand for Money by Individuals

Having discussed the functions of money and the definition of the money supply, we now examine the factors that determine the amount of money an individual desires to hold. The determinants of individual money demand can be derived from the theory of asset demand discussed in the previous chapter.

We saw in the previous chapter that individuals base their demand for an asset on three characteristics:

1. The expected return the asset offers compared with the returns offered by other assets.
2. The riskiness of the asset's expected return.
3. The asset's liquidity.

While liquidity plays no important role in determining the relative demands for assets traded in the foreign exchange market, households and firms hold money only because of its liquidity. To understand how the economy's households and firms decide the amount of money they wish to hold, we must look more closely at how the three considerations listed influence money demand.

# Expected Return

Currency pays no interest. Checking deposits often do pay some interest, but they offer a rate of return that usually fails to keep pace with the higher returns offered by less liquid forms of wealth. When you hold money, you therefore sacrifice the higher interest rate you could earn by holding your wealth in a government bond, a large time deposit, or some other relatively illiquid asset. It is this last rate of interest we have in mind when we refer to "the" interest rate. Since the interest paid on currency is zero while that paid on "checkable" deposits tends to be relatively constant, the difference between the rate of return of money in general and that of less liquid alternative assets is reflected by the market interest rate: The higher the interest rate, the more you sacrifice by holding wealth in the form of money.[2]

Suppose, for example, the interest rate you could earn from a U.S. Treasury bill is 10 percent per year. If you use  \$10,000 of your wealth to buy a Treasury bill, you will be paid\$ 11,000 by Uncle Sam at the end of a year, but if you choose instead to keep the \$10,000 as cash in a safe-deposit box, you give up the \$1,000 interest you could have earned by buying the Treasury bill. You thus sacrifice a 10 percent rate of return by holding your \$10,000 as money.

The theory of asset demand developed in the previous chapter shows how changes in the rate of interest affect the demand for money. The theory states that, other things equal, people prefer assets offering higher expected returns. Because an increase in the interest rate is a rise in the rate of return on less liquid assets relative to the rate of return on money, individuals will want to hold more of their wealth in nonmoney assets that pay the market interest rate and less of their wealth in the form of money if the interest rate rises. We conclude that, all else equal, a rise in the interest rate causes the demand for money to fall.

We can also describe the influence of the interest rate on money demand in terms of the economic concept of opportunity cost—the amount you sacrifice by taking one course of action rather than another. The interest rate measures the opportunity cost of holding money rather than interest-bearing bonds. A rise in the interest rate therefore raises the cost of holding money and causes money demand to fall.

# Risk

Risk is not an important factor in money demand. It is risky to hold money because an unexpected increase in the prices of goods and services could reduce the value of your money in terms of the commodities you consume. Since interest-paying assets such as government bonds have face values fixed in terms of money, however, the same unexpected increase in prices would reduce the real value of those assets by the same percentage. Because any change in the riskiness of money causes an equal change in the riskiness of bonds, changes in the risk of holding money need not cause individuals to reduce their demand for money and increase their demand for interest-paying assets.

# Liquidity

The main benefit of holding money comes from its liquidity. Households and firms hold money because it is the easiest way of financing their everyday purchases. Some large purchases can be financed through the sale of a substantial illiquid asset. An art collector, for example, could sell one of her Picassos to buy a house. To finance a continuing stream of smaller expenditures at various times and for various amounts, however, households and firms have to hold some money.

An individual's need for liquidity rises when the average daily value of his transactions rises. A student who takes the bus every day, for example, does not need to hold as much cash as a business executive who takes taxis during rush hour. We conclude that a rise in the average value of transactions that a household or firm carries out causes its demand for money to rise.

# Aggregate Money Demand

Our discussion of how individual households and firms determine their demands for money can now be applied to derive the determinants of aggregate money demand, the total demand for money by all households and firms in the economy. Aggregate money demand is just the sum of all the economy's individual money demands.

Three main factors determine aggregate money demand:

1. The interest rate. A rise in the interest rate causes each individual in the economy to reduce her demand for money. All else equal, aggregate money demand therefore falls when the interest rate rises.

2. The price level. The economy's price level is the price of a broad reference basket of goods and services in terms of currency. Generally, the reference basket includes standard, everyday consumption items such as food, clothing, and housing and less routine purchases such as medical care and legal fees. If the price level rises, individual households and firms must spend more money than before to purchase their usual weekly baskets of goods and services. To maintain the same level of liquidity as before the price level increase, they will therefore have to hold more money.

3. Real national income. When real national income (GNP) rises, more goods and services are sold in the economy. This increase in the real value of transactions raises the demand for money, given the price level.

If  $P$  is the price level,  $R$  is the interest rate, and  $Y$  is real GNP, the aggregate demand for money,  $M^d$ , can be expressed as

$$
M^{d} = P \times L (R, Y), \tag {15-1}
$$

where the value of  $L(R, Y)$  falls when  $R$  rises, and rises when  $Y$  rises. To see why we have specified that aggregate money demand is proportional to the price level, imagine that all prices doubled but the interest rate and everyone's real incomes remained unchanged. The money value of each individual's average daily transactions would then simply double, as would the amount of money each wished to hold.

We usually write the aggregate money demand relation (15-1) in the equivalent form

$$
M^{d} / P = L (R, Y), \tag {15-2}
$$

and call \( L(R, Y) \) aggregate real money demand. This way of expressing money demand shows that the aggregate demand for liquidity, \( L(R, Y) \), is not a demand for a certain number of currency units but is instead a demand to hold a certain amount of real purchasing power in liquid form. The ratio \( M^d / P \) that is, desired money holdings measured in terms of a typical reference basket of commodities—equals the amount of real purchasing power people would like to hold in liquid form. For example, if people wished to hold \(1,000 in cash at a price level of \)100 per commodity basket, their real money holdings would be equivalent to \(1,000 / (\)100 per basket) = 10 baskets. If the price level doubled (to \$200 per basket), the purchasing power of their \(1,000 in cash would be halved, since it would now be worth only 5 baskets.

Figure 15-1 shows how aggregate real money demand is affected by the interest rate for a fixed level of real income,  $Y$ . The aggregate real money demand schedule  $L(R, Y)$  slopes downward because a fall in the interest rate raises the desired real money holdings of each household and firm in the economy.

For a given level of real GNP, changes in the interest rate cause movements along the  $L(R, Y)$  schedule. Changes in real GNP, however, cause the schedule itself to shift. Figure 15-2 shows how a rise in real GNP from  $Y^1$  to  $Y^2$  affects the position of the aggregate real money demand schedule. Because a rise in real GNP raises aggregate real money demand for a given interest rate, the schedule  $L(R, Y^2)$  lies to the right of  $L(R, Y^1)$  when  $Y^2$  is greater than  $Y^1$ .

# FIGURE 15-1

# The Equilibrium Interest Rate: The Interaction of Money Supply and Demand

As you might expect from other economics courses you've taken, the money market is in equilibrium when the money supply set by the central bank equals aggregate money demand. In this section, we see how the interest rate is determined by money market

equilibrium, given the price level and output, both of which are temporarily assumed to be unaffected by monetary changes.

# Equilibrium in the Money Market

If  $M^s$  is the money supply, the condition for equilibrium in the money market is

$$
M^{s} = M^{d}. \tag {15-3}
$$

After dividing both sides of this equality by the price level, we can express the money market equilibrium condition in terms of aggregate real money demand as

$$
M^{s} / P = L (R, Y). \tag {15-4}
$$

Given the price level,  $P$ , and the level of output,  $Y$ , the equilibrium interest rate is the one at which aggregate real money demand equals the real money supply.

In Figure 15-3, the aggregate real money demand schedule intersects the real money supply schedule at point 1 to give an equilibrium interest rate of  $R^1$ . The money supply schedule is vertical at  $M^s / P$  because  $M^s$  is set by the central bank while  $P$  is taken as given.

FIGURE 15-3 Determination of the Equilibrium Interest Rate

With  $P$  and  $Y$  given and a real money supply of  $M^S / P$ , money market equilibrium is at point 1. At this point, aggregate real money demand and the real money supply are equal and the equilibrium interest rate is  $R^1$ .

Let's see why the interest rate tends to settle at its equilibrium level by considering what happens if the market is initially at point 2, with an interest rate,  $R^2$ , that is above  $R^1$ .

At point 2, the demand for real money holdings falls short of the supply by  $Q^1 - Q^2$ , so there is an excess supply of money. If individuals are holding more money than they desire given the interest rate of  $R^2$ , they will attempt to reduce their liquidity by using some money to purchase interest-bearing assets. In other words, individuals will attempt to get rid of their excess money by lending it to others. Since there is an aggregate excess supply of money at  $R^2$ , however, not everyone can succeed in doing this: There are more people who would like to lend money to reduce their liquidity than there are people who would like to borrow money to increase theirs. Those who cannot unload their extra money try to tempt potential borrowers by lowering the interest rate they charge for loans below  $R^2$ . The downward pressure on the interest rate continues until the rate reaches  $R^1$ . At this interest rate, anyone wishing to lend money can do so because the aggregate excess supply of money has disappeared; that is, supply once again equals demand. Once the market reaches point 1, there is therefore no further tendency for the interest rate to drop.[4]

Similarly, if the interest rate is initially at a level  $R^3$  below  $R^1$ , it will tend to rise. As Figure 15-3 shows, there is excess demand for money equal to  $Q^3 - Q^1$  at point 3. Individuals therefore attempt to sell interest-bearing assets such as bonds to increase their money holdings (that is, they sell bonds for cash). At point 3, however, not everyone can succeed in selling enough interest-bearing assets to satisfy his or her demand for money. Thus, people bid for money by offering to borrow at progressively higher interest rates and push the interest rate upward toward  $R^1$ . Only when the market has reached point 1 and the excess demand for money has been eliminated does the interest rate stop rising.

We can summarize our findings as follows: The market always moves toward an interest rate at which the real money supply equals aggregate real money demand. If there is initially an excess supply of money, the interest rate falls, and if there is initially an excess demand, it rises.

# Interest Rates and the Money Supply

The effect of increasing the money supply at a given price level is illustrated in Figure 15-4. Initially, the money market is in equilibrium at point 1, with a money supply  $M^1$  and an interest rate  $R^1$ . Since we are holding  $P$  constant, a rise in the money supply to  $M^2$  increases the real money supply from  $M^1 / P$  to  $M^2 / P$ . With a real money supply of  $M^2 / P$ , point 2 is the new equilibrium and  $R^2$  is the new, lower interest rate that induces people to hold the increased available real money supply.

The process through which the interest rate falls is by now familiar. After  $M^s$  is increased by the central bank, there is initially an excess real supply of money at the old equilibrium interest rate,  $R^1$ , which previously balanced the market. Since people are holding more money than they desire, they use their surplus funds to bid for assets that pay interest. The economy as a whole cannot reduce its money holdings, so interest rates are driven down as unwilling money holders compete to lend their excess cash balances. At point 2 in Figure 15-4, the interest rate has fallen sufficiently to induce an increase in real money demand equal to the increase in the real money supply.

FIGURE 15-4 Effect of an Increase in the Money Supply on the Interest Rate
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/52971ed2-f993-4611-9c28-dd416948cd16/da9a1fc82f86f58fef41774d159a01668b39520ae83130c6bbae90df8c3f25c3.jpg)
For a given price level,  $P$ , and real income level,  $Y$ , an increase in the money supply from  $M^1$  to  $M^2$  reduces the interest rate from  $R^1$  (point 1) to  $R^2$  (point 2).

By running the preceding policy experiment in reverse, we can see how a reduction of the money supply forces interest rates upward. A fall in  $M^s$  causes an excess demand for money at the interest rate that previously balanced supply and demand. People attempt to sell interest-bearing assets—that is, to borrow—to rebuild their depleted real money holdings. Since they cannot all be successful when there is excess money demand, the interest rate is pushed upward until everyone is content to hold the smaller real money stock.

We conclude that an increase in the money supply lowers the interest rate, while a fall in the money supply raises the interest rate, given the price level and output.

# Output and the Interest Rate

Figure 15-5 shows the effect on the interest rate of a rise in the level of output from  $Y^{1}$  to  $Y^{2}$ , given the money supply and the price level. As we saw earlier, an increase in output causes the entire aggregate real money demand schedule to shift to the right, moving the equilibrium away from point 1. At the old equilibrium interest rate,  $R^{1}$ , there is an excess demand for money equal to  $Q^{2} - Q^{1}$  (point 1'). Since the real money supply is given, the interest rate is bid up until it reaches the higher, new equilibrium level  $R^{2}$  (point 2). A fall in output has opposite effects, causing the aggregate real money demand schedule to shift to the left and therefore causing the equilibrium interest rate to fall.

We conclude that an increase in real output raises the interest rate, while a fall in real output lowers the interest rate, given the price level and the money supply.

FIGURE 15-5 Effect on the Interest Rate of a Rise in Real Income

Given the real money supply,  $M^S / P(= Q^1)$ , a rise in real income from  $Y^1$  to  $Y^2$  raises the interest rate from  $R^1$  (point 1) to  $R^2$  (point 2).

# The Money Supply and the Exchange Rate in the Short Run

In Chapter 14, we learned about the interest parity condition, which predicts how interest rate movements influence the exchange rate, given expectations about the exchange rate's future level. Now that we know how shifts in a country's money supply affect the interest rate on nonmoney assets denominated in its currency, we can see how monetary changes affect the exchange rate. We will discover that an increase in a country's money supply causes its currency to depreciate in the foreign exchange market, while a reduction in the money supply causes its currency to appreciate.

In this section, we continue to take the price level (along with real output) as given, and for that reason we label the analysis of this section short run. The long-run analysis of an economic event allows for the complete adjustment of the price level (which may take a long time) and for full employment of all factors of production. Later in this chapter, we examine the long-run effects of money supply changes on the price level, the exchange rate, and other macroeconomic variables. Our long-run analysis will show how the money supply influences exchange rate expectations, which we also continue to take as given for now.

# Linking Money, the Interest Rate, and the Exchange Rate

To analyze the relationship between money and the exchange rate in the short run in Figure 15-6, we combine two diagrams we have already studied separately. Let's assume once again we are looking at the dollar/euro exchange rate, that is, the price of euros in terms of dollars.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/52971ed2-f993-4611-9c28-dd416948cd16/d8977663311395e5113003ea322a87eba66627aacf6d6243b9f1bc2592cee67c.jpg)
FIGURE 15-6 Simultaneous Equilibrium in the U.S. Money Market and the Foreign Exchange Market

Both asset markets are in equilibrium at the interest rate  $R_{\S}^{1}$  and exchange rate  $E_{\S/\epsilon}^{1}$ ; at these values, money supply equals money demand (point 1) and the interest parity condition holds (point 1').

The first diagram (introduced as Figure 14-4) shows equilibrium in the foreign exchange market and how it is determined given interest rates and expectations about future exchange rates. This diagram appears as the top part of Figure 15-6. The dollar interest rate,  $R_{\S}^{1}$ , which is determined in the money market, defines the vertical schedule.

As you will remember from Chapter 14, the downward-sloping expected euro return schedule shows the expected return on euro deposits, measured in dollars. The schedule slopes downward because of the effect of current exchange rate changes on

expectations of future depreciation: A strengthening of the dollar today (a fall in  $E_{\$/ \in}$ ) relative to its given expected future level makes euro deposits more attractive by leading people to anticipate a sharper dollar depreciation in the future.

At the intersection of the two schedules (point  $1'$ ), the expected rates of return on dollar and euro deposits are equal, and therefore interest parity holds.  $E_{\mathbb{S} / \infty}^{1}$  is the equilibrium exchange rate.

The second diagram we need to examine the relationship between money and the exchange rate was introduced as Figure 15-3. This figure shows how a country's equilibrium interest rate is determined in its money market, and it appears as the bottom part of Figure 15-6. For convenience, however, the figure has been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees so that dollar interest rates are measured from 0 on the horizontal axis and the U.S. real money supply is measured from 0 on the descending vertical axis. Money market equilibrium is shown at point 1, where the dollar interest rate  $R_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{l}}$  induces people to demand real balances equal to the U.S. real money supply,  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^{\mathrm{s}} / P_{\mathrm{US}}$ .

Figure 15-6 emphasizes the link between the U.S. money market (bottom) and the foreign exchange market (top)—the U.S. money market determines the dollar interest rate, which in turn affects the exchange rate that maintains interest parity. (Of course, there is a similar link between the European money market and the foreign exchange market that operates through changes in the euro interest rate.)

Figure 15-7 illustrates these linkages. The U.S. and European central banks, the Federal Reserve System and the European Central Bank (ECB), respectively, determine

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/52971ed2-f993-4611-9c28-dd416948cd16/7690795393b4f66587bb5357aba3863fb007a4b20ace0e5ab5f920d2556e1516.jpg)

the U.S. and European money supplies,  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^s$  and  $M_{\mathrm{E}}^s$ . Given the price levels and national incomes of the two countries, equilibrium in national money markets leads to the dollar and euro interest rates  $R_{\S}$  and  $R_{\in}$ . These interest rates feed into the foreign exchange market, where, given expectations about the future dollar/euro exchange rate, the current rate  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}$  is determined by the interest parity condition.

# U.S. Money Supply and the Dollar/Euro Exchange Rate

We now use our model of asset market linkages (the links between the money and foreign exchange markets) to ask how the dollar/euro exchange rate changes when the Federal Reserve changes the U.S. money supply  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^{\mathrm{s}}$ . The effects of this change are summarized in Figure 15-8.

At the initial money supply  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^1$ , the money market is in equilibrium at point 1 with an interest rate  $R_{\S}^{1}$ . Given the euro interest rate and the expected future exchange rate, a dollar interest rate of  $R_{\S}^{1}$  implies that foreign exchange market equilibrium occurs at point  $1'$  with an exchange rate equal to  $E_{\S/\in}^{1}$ .

What happens when the Federal Reserve, perhaps fearing the onset of a recession, raises the U.S. money supply to  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^2$ ? This increase sets in motion the following sequence of events: (1) At the initial interest rate  $R_{\mathbb{S}}^{1}$ , there is an excess supply of money in the U.S. money market, so the dollar interest rate falls to  $R_{\mathbb{S}}^{2}$  as the money market reaches its new equilibrium position (point 2). (2) Given the initial exchange rate  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$  and the new, lower interest rate on dollars,  $R_{\mathbb{S}}^{2}$ , the expected return on euro deposits is greater than that on dollar deposits. Holders of dollar deposits therefore try to sell them for euro deposits, which are momentarily more attractive. (3) The dollar depreciates to  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2}$  as holders of dollar deposits bid for euro deposits. The foreign exchange market is once again in equilibrium at point  $2'$  because the exchange rate's move to  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2}$  causes a fall in the dollar's expected future depreciation rate sufficient to offset the fall in the dollar interest rate.

We conclude that an increase in a country's money supply causes its currency to depreciate in the foreign exchange market. By running Figure 15-8 in reverse, you can see that a reduction in a country's money supply causes its currency to appreciate in the foreign exchange market.

# Europe's Money Supply and the Dollar/Euro Exchange Rate

The conclusions we have reached also apply when the ECB changes Europe's money supply. Suppose the ECB fears a recession in Europe and hopes to head it off through a looser monetary policy. An increase in  $M_{\mathrm{E}}^{s}$  causes a depreciation of the euro (that is, an appreciation of the dollar, or a fall in  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\mathbb{E}}$ ), while a reduction in  $M_{\mathrm{E}}^{s}$  causes an appreciation of the euro (that is, a depreciation of the dollar, or a rise in  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\mathbb{E}}$ ).

The mechanism at work, which runs from the European interest rate to the exchange rate, is the same as the one we just analyzed. It is a good exercise to verify these assertions by drawing figures similar to Figures 15-6 and 15-8 that illustrate the linkage between the European money market and the foreign exchange market.

Here we use a different approach to show how changes in Europe's money supply affect the dollar/euro exchange rate. In Chapter 14, we learned that a fall in the euro interest rate,  $R_{\epsilon}$ , shifts the downward-sloping schedule in the upper part of Figure 15-6 to the left. The reason is that for any level of the exchange rate, a fall in  $R_{\epsilon}$  lowers the expected rate of return on euro deposits. Since a rise in the European money supply  $M_{\mathrm{E}}^{\mathrm{f}}$  lowers  $R_{\epsilon}$ , we can see the effect on the exchange rate by shifting the expected euro return schedule in the top part of Figure 15-6 to the left.

# Effect on the Dollar/Euro Exchange Rate and Dollar Interest Rate of an Increase in the U.S. Money Supply

Given  $P_{\mathrm{US}}$  and  $Y_{\mathrm{US}}$  when the money supply rises from  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^{1}$  to  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^{2}$  the dollar interest rate declines (as money market equilibrium is reestablished at point 2) and the dollar depreciates against the euro (as foreign exchange market equilibrium is reestablished at point  $2'$ ).

The result of an increase in the European money supply is shown in Figure 15-9. Initially, the U.S. money market is in equilibrium at point 1 and the foreign exchange market is in equilibrium at point  $1'$ , with an exchange rate  $E_{\$/ \in}^{1}$ . An increase in Europe's money supply lowers  $R_{\in}$  and therefore shifts to the left the schedule linking the expected return on euro deposits to the exchange rate. Foreign exchange market

# Effect of an Increase in the European Money Supply on the Dollar/Euro Exchange Rate

By lowering the dollar return on euro deposits (shown as a leftward shift in the expected euro return curve), an increase in Europe's money supply causes the dollar to appreciate against the euro. Equilibrium in the foreign exchange market shifts from point  $1'$  to point  $2'$ , but equilibrium in the U.S. money market remains at point 1.

equilibrium is restored at point  $2'$ , with an exchange rate  $E_{\S/\in}^2$ . We see that the increase in European money causes the euro to depreciate against the dollar (that is, causes a fall in the dollar price of euros). Similarly, a fall in Europe's money supply would cause the euro to appreciate against the dollar (that is,  $E_{\S/\in}$  would rise). The change in the

European money supply does not disturb the U.S. money market equilibrium, which remains at point 1.<sup>5</sup>

# Money, the Price Level, and the Exchange Rate in the Long Run

Our short-run analysis of the link between countries' money markets and the foreign exchange market rested on the simplifying assumption that price levels and exchange rate expectations were given. To extend our understanding of how money supply and money demand affect exchange rates, we must examine how monetary factors affect a country's price level in the long run.

An economy's long-run equilibrium is the position it would eventually reach if no new economic shocks occurred during the adjustment to full employment. You can think of long-run equilibrium as the equilibrium that would be maintained after all wages and prices had had enough time to adjust to their market-clearing levels. An equivalent way of thinking of it is as the equilibrium that would occur if prices were perfectly flexible and always adjusted immediately to preserve full employment.

In studying how monetary changes work themselves out over the long run, we will examine how such changes shift the economy's long-run equilibrium. Our main tool is once again the theory of aggregate money demand.

# Money and Money Prices

If the price level and output are fixed in the short run, the condition (15-4) of money market equilibrium,

$$
M^{s} / P = L (R, Y),
$$

determines the domestic interest rate,  $R$ . The money market always moves to equilibrium, however, even if we drop our "short-run" assumption and think of periods over which  $P$  and  $Y$ , as well as  $R$ , can vary. The preceding equilibrium condition can therefore be rearranged to give

$$
P = M^{s} / L (R, Y), \tag {15-5}
$$

which shows how the price level depends on the interest rate, real output, and the domestic money supply.

The long-run equilibrium price level is just the value of  $P$  that satisfies condition (15-5) when the interest rate and output are at their long-run levels, that is, at levels consistent with full employment. When the money market is in equilibrium and all factors of production are fully employed, the price level will remain steady if the money supply, the aggregate money demand function, and the long-run values of  $R$  and  $Y$  remain steady.

One of the most important predictions of the previous equation for  $P$  concerns the relationship between a country's price level and its money supply,  $M^s$ : All else equal, an increase in a country's money supply causes a proportional increase in its price level.

If, for example, the money supply doubles (to  $2M^s$ ) but output and the interest rate do not change, the price level must also double (to  $2P$ ) to maintain equilibrium in the money market.

The economic reasoning behind this very precise prediction follows from our earlier observation that the demand for money is a demand for real money holdings: Real money demand is not altered by an increase in  $M^s$  that leaves  $R$  and  $Y$  [and thus aggregate real money demand  $L(R, Y)$ ] unchanged. If aggregate real money demand does not change, however, the money market will remain in equilibrium only if the real money supply also stays the same. To keep the real money supply  $M^s / P$  constant,  $P$  must rise in proportion to  $M^s$ .

# The Long-Run Effects of Money Supply Changes

Our theory of how the money supply affects the price level given the interest rate and output is not yet a theory of how money supply changes affect the price level in the long run. To develop such a theory, we still have to determine the long-run effects of a money supply change on the interest rate and output. This is easier than you might think. As we now argue, a change in the supply of money has no effect on the long-run values of the interest rate or real output.<sup>6</sup>

The best way to understand the long-run effects of money supply on the interest rate and output is to think first about a currency reform, in which a country's government redefines the national currency unit. For example, the government of Turkey reformed its currency on January 1, 2005, simply by issuing "new" Turkish lira, each equal to 1 million "old" Turkish lira. The effect of this reform was to lower the number of currency units in circulation, and all lira prices, to  $1/1,000,000$  of their old lira values. But the redefinition of the monetary unit had no effect on real output, the interest rate, or the relative prices of goods: All that occurred was a one-time change in all values measured in lira. A decision to measure distance in half-miles rather than miles would have as little effect on real economic variables as the Turkish government's decision to chop six zeros off the end of every magnitude measured in terms of money.

An increase in the supply of a country's currency has the same effect in the long run as a currency reform. A doubling of the money supply, for example, has the same long-run effect as a currency reform in which each unit of currency is replaced by two units of "new" currency. If the economy is initially fully employed, every money price in the economy eventually doubles, but real GNP, the interest rate, and all relative prices return to their long-run or full-employment levels.

Why is a money supply change just like a currency reform in its effects on the economy's long-run equilibrium? The full-employment output level is determined by the economy's endowments of labor and capital, so in the long run, real output does not depend on the money supply. Similarly, the interest rate is independent of the money supply in the long run. If the money supply and all prices double permanently, there is no reason why people previously willing to exchange  \$1 today for\$ 1.10 a year from now should not be willing afterward to exchange \$2 today for \$2.20 a year from now, so the interest rate will remain at 10 percent per annum. Relative prices also remain the

same if all money prices double, since relative prices are just ratios of money prices. Thus, money supply changes do not change the long-run allocation of resources. Only the absolute level of money prices changes.<sup>7</sup>

When studying the effect of an increase in the money supply over long time periods, we are therefore justified in assuming that the long-run values of  $R$  and  $Y$  will not be changed by a change in the supply of money. Thus, we can draw the following conclusion from equation (15-5): A permanent increase in the money supply causes a proportional increase in the price level's long-run value. In particular, if the economy is initially at full employment, a permanent increase in the money supply eventually will be followed by a proportional increase in the price level.

# Empirical Evidence on Money Supplies and Price Levels

In looking at actual data on money and prices, we should not expect to see an exactly proportional relationship over long periods, partly because output, the interest rate, and the aggregate real money demand function can shift for reasons that have nothing to do with the supply of money. Output changes as a result of capital accumulation and technological advance (for example, more powerful computers), and money demand behavior may change as a result of demographic trends or financial innovations such as electronic cash-transfer facilities. In addition, actual economies are rarely in positions of long-run equilibrium. Nonetheless, we should expect the data to show a clear-cut positive association between money supplies and price levels. If real-world data did not provide strong evidence that money supplies and price levels move together in the long run, the usefulness of the theory of money demand we have developed would be in severe doubt.

The wide swings in Latin American rates of price level increase in recent decades make the region an ideal case study of the relationship between money supplies and price levels. Price level inflation had been high and variable in Latin America for more than a decade, when efforts at macroeconomic reform began to bring inflation lower by the mid-1990s.

On the basis of our theories, we would expect to find such sharp swings in inflation rates accompanied by swings in growth rates of money supplies. This expectation is confirmed by Figure 15-10, which plots annual average growth rates of the money supply against annual inflation rates over the period from 1980–2014. On average, years with higher money growth also tended to be years with higher inflation. In addition, the data points cluster around the 45-degree line, along which money supplies and price levels increase in proportion.

The main lesson to be drawn from Figure 15-10 is that the data confirm the strong long-run link between national money supplies and national price levels predicted by economic theory.

Figure 15-11 presents another illustration of the link between money-supply growth and inflation, the case of Venezuela, which experienced exceptionally high levels of both in the later 2010s. So far in the 21st century, Venezuela's inflationary experience is comparable only to that of Zimbabwe, which we discuss in greater detail later, and it was similarly driven by the government's need to print money to cover its budgetary needs in the face of economic distress.

# Money and the Exchange Rate in the Long Run

The domestic currency price of foreign currency is one of the many prices in the economy that rise in the long run after a permanent increase in the money supply. If you think again about the effects of a currency reform, you will see how the exchange rate moves in the long run. Suppose the U.S. government replaced every pair of "old" dollars with one "new" dollar. Then, if the dollar/euro exchange rate had been 1.20 old dollars per euro before the reform, it would change to 0.60 new dollars per euro immediately after the reform. In much the same way, a halving of the U.S. money supply would eventually lead the dollar to appreciate from an exchange rate of 1.20 dollars/ euro to one of 0.60 dollars/euro. Since the dollar prices of all U.S. goods and services would also decrease by half, this 50 percent appreciation of the dollar leaves the relative prices of all U.S. and foreign goods and services unchanged.

We conclude that, all else equal, a permanent increase in a country's money supply causes a proportional long-run depreciation of its currency against foreign currencies. Similarly, a permanent decrease in a country's money supply causes a proportional long-run appreciation of its currency against foreign currencies.

# Inflation and Exchange Rate Dynamics

In this section, we tie together our short- and long-run findings about the effects of monetary changes by examining the process through which the price level adjusts to its long-run position. An economy experiences inflation when its price level is rising and deflation when its price level is falling. Our examination of inflation will give us a deeper understanding of how the exchange rate adjusts to monetary disturbances in the economy.

# Short-Run Price Rigidity versus Long-Run Price Flexibility

Our analysis of the short-run effects of monetary changes assumed that a country's price level, unlike its exchange rate, does not jump immediately. This assumption cannot be exactly correct because many commodities, such as agricultural products, are traded in markets where prices adjust sharply every day as supply or demand conditions shift. In addition, exchange rate changes themselves may affect the prices of some tradable goods and services that enter into the commodity basket defining the price level.

Many prices in the economy, however, are written into long-term contracts and cannot be changed immediately when changes in the money supply occur. The most important prices of this type are workers' wages, which are negotiated only periodically in

many industries. Wages do not enter indices of the price level directly, but they make up a large fraction of the cost of producing goods and services. Since output prices depend heavily on production costs, the behavior of the overall price level is influenced by the sluggishness of wage movements. The short-run "stickiness" of price levels is illustrated by Figure 15-12, which compares data on month-to-month percentage changes in the dollar/yen exchange rate,  $E_{\mathrm{S/N}}$ , with data on month-to-month percentage changes in the ratio of money price levels in the United States and Japan,  $P_{\mathrm{US}} / P_{\mathrm{J}}$ . As you can see, the exchange rate is much more variable than relative price levels, a fact consistent with the view that price levels are relatively rigid in the short run. The pattern shown in the figure applies to all of the main industrial countries in recent decades. In light of this and other evidence, we will therefore continue to assume the price level is given in the short run and does not make significant jumps in response to policy changes.

This assumption would not be reasonable, however, for all countries at all times. In extremely inflationary conditions, such as those seen in the 1980s in some Latin American countries, long-term contracts specifying domestic money payments may go

out of use. Automatic price level indexation of wage payments may also be widespread under highly inflationary conditions. Such developments make the price level much less rigid than it would be under moderate inflation, and large price level jumps become possible. Some price rigidity can remain, however, even in the face of inflation rates that would be high by everyday industrial-country standards. For example, Turkey's 30 percent inflation rate for 2002 seems high until it is compared with the 114 percent depreciation of the Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar over the same year.

Our analysis assuming short-run price rigidity is nonetheless most applicable to countries with histories of comparative price level stability, such as the United States. Even in the cases of low-inflation countries, there is a lively academic debate over the possibility that seemingly sticky wages and prices are in reality quite flexible.[8]

Although the price level appears to display short-run stickiness in many countries, a change in the money supply creates immediate demand and cost pressures that eventually lead to future increases in the price level. These pressures come from three main sources:

1. Excess demand for output and labor. An increase in the money supply has an exponential effect on the economy, raising the total demand for goods and services. To meet this demand, producers of goods and services must employ workers overtime and make new hires. Even if wages are given in the short run, the additional demand for labor allows workers to ask for higher wages in the next round of wage negotiations. Producers are willing to pay these higher wages, for they know that in a booming economy, it will not be hard to pass higher wage costs on to consumers through higher product prices.
2. Inflationary expectations. If everyone expects the price level to rise in the future, their expectation will increase the pace of inflation today. Workers bargaining over wage contracts will insist on higher money wages to counteract the effect on their real wages of the anticipated general increase in prices. Producers, once again, will give in to these wage demands if they expect product prices to rise and cover the additional wage costs.
3. Raw materials prices. Many raw materials used in the production of final goods, for example, petroleum products and metals, are sold in markets where prices adjust sharply even in the short run. By causing the prices of such materials to jump upward, a money supply increase raises production costs in materials-using industries. Eventually, producers in those industries will raise product prices to cover their higher costs.

# MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH AND HYPERINFLATION IN ZIMBABWE

Since the French Revolution, there have been more than 30 recorded episodes of hyperinflation: an explosive and seemingly uncontrollable inflation in which money loses value rapidly and may even go out of use.

All hyperinflations have been driven by massive money-supply growth, starting with the French revolutionary government's issuance of a paper currency, called assignats, to pay for its spending needs.

Monthly Inflation in Zimbabwe, 2007-2008

One of two cases of hyperinflation in the 21st century (the other being Venezuela), but one of the most extreme ever, occurred in the African nation of Zimbabwe between 2007 and 2009. During hyperinflations, the magnitudes of monetary changes are so enormous that the "long-run" effects of money on the price level can occur very quickly. These episodes therefore provide laboratory conditions well suited for testing long-run theories about the effects of money supplies on prices.[9]

Like other hyperinflations, Zimbabwe's was fueled by the government's need to cover its expenses by printing money. These expenses included a four-year war in the Congo that began in 1998 and large-scale support of agriculture, all

at a time when foreigners were withdrawing loans, investment, and aid because of domestic political turbulence. Inflation was the result, and the currency's exchange rate, while officially controlled by the government, depreciated rapidly in a parallel black market where market forces prevailed. On April 1, 2006, the government carried out a currency reform, creating a new Zimbabwean dollar (Z$) equivalent to 1,000 old ones.

In 2007, high inflation crossed the line into hyperinflation, as illustrated in the accompanying figure. The monthly inflation rate surpassed 50 percent in March 2007 and generally rose from there. On July 1, 2008, the government issued a Z\$100 billion note—at the time, roughly equal to the price of three eggs—and the following month

carried out a further currency reform with each new new Z$ equivalent to 10 billion old new dollars. But the situation only worsened. Official CPI statistics of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the central bank, show that the price level rose by a factor of 36,661,304 between January 2007 and July 2008 (when the bank stopped reporting price data). The RBZ's numbers may be underestimates. According to one report, the rate of inflation for the month of October 2008 alone exceeded 33,000,000 percent! Yet another currency reform, on February 3, 2009, created the fourth Z$, equivalent to 1 trillion of the former currency units.

By early 2009, however, the hyperinflation was coming to an end on its own because people were avoiding the unstable  $Z\mathbb{S}$  and instead relying on foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar, the South African rand, and the pula of Botswana. A new coalition government legalized foreign currency use, suspended the legal tender status of the Z $\mathbb{S}$ , and announced that it would conduct all of its own transactions in U.S. dollars. Importantly, the government (which could no longer print money) adopted a "cash budgeting" rule, allowing itself to spend only the money it brought in through taxes. Because the Z $\mathbb{S}$  quickly went out of use, the RBZ gave up reporting its exchange rate after November 6, 2009. Inflation (now measured in U.S. dollar terms) dropped dramatically in 2009.[11] Although several currencies continued to circulate side by side, the U.S. dollar was dominant. Thus, the inflation rate measured in U.S. dollars became the most important one for Zimbabwe's households and businesses.

After 2009 Zimbabwe still suffered from numerous economic problems, many of them stemming from its years of extreme macroeconomic instability and continuing structural distortions, including rampant corruption. Inflation, however, was not

one of them: inflation of dollar prices remained low, under 5 percent per year. Unfortunately, after 2014, low and positive inflation turned into deflation, that is, a negative rate of inflation. A persistent fall in prices brings a host of complications of its own, as we will discuss in Chapter 17. Zimbabwe's deflation reflected not only low U.S. inflation but also a deeper setback for its economy, a collapse in the world prices of its main exports, commodities such as iron ore, timber, and cotton. By adopting a foreign currency as its own, the Zimbabwean government gave up its ability to control its money supply. It became unable to create money to curtail deflation but instead had to import the U.S. dollars needed that make up its money supply through current account surpluses, foreign aid, and workers' remittances from abroad.

Given the weakness of its exports, Zimbabwe's economy was starved of dollars by 2015, and so in 2016 the government introduced "bond notes" backed by 200 million U.S. dollars borrowed from the African Export-Import Bank.[12] The bond notes soon depreciated, however, leading the government to create new electronic notes to augment the supply. In February 2019, the government merged these notes with a new electronic currency called the Zimdollar, and in November 2019, it began to issue paper Zimdollar notes.

Amid this currency turmoil and with a continuing incentive for the government to issue money to finance its deficits, high inflation returned. According to data from the RBZ, February 2020 inflation was 13.5 percent (equivalent to 540 percent at an annual rate) and March 2020 inflation was 26.6 percent (676 percent at an annual rate). Facing the turmoil of a new global recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, Zimbabwe's citizens were bracing for even worse in the months ahead.

# Permanent Money Supply Changes and the Exchange Rate

We now apply our analysis of inflation to study the adjustment of the dollar/euro exchange rate following a permanent increase in the U.S. money supply. Figure 15-13 shows both the short-run (Figure 15-13a) and the long-run (Figure 15-13b) effects of this disturbance. We suppose the economy starts with all variables at their long-run levels and that output remains constant as the economy adjusts to the money supply change.

Figure 15-13a assumes the U.S. price level is initially given at  $P_{\mathrm{US}}^{\mathrm{l}}$ . An increase in the nominal money supply from  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^{\mathrm{l}}$  to  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^2$  therefore raises the real money supply from  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^{\mathrm{l}} / P_{\mathrm{US}}^{\mathrm{l}}$  to  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^2 / P_{\mathrm{US}}^{\mathrm{l}}$  in the short run, lowering the interest rate from  $R_{\S}^{\mathrm{l}}$  (point 1) to  $R_{\S}^2$  (point 2). So far, our analysis proceeds exactly as it did earlier in this chapter.

(a) Short-run adjustment of the asset markets. (b) How the interest rate, price level, and exchange rate move over time as the economy approaches its long-run equilibrium.

The first change in our analysis comes when we ask how the American money supply change [shown in the bottom part of panel (a)] affects the foreign exchange market [shown in the top part of panel (a)]. As before, the fall in the U.S. interest rate is shown as a leftward shift in the vertical schedule giving the dollar return on dollar deposits. This is no longer the whole story, however, for the money supply increase now affects exchange rate expectations. Because the U.S. money supply change is permanent, people expect a long-run increase in all dollar prices, including the exchange rate, which is the dollar price of euros. As you will recall from Chapter 14, a rise in the expected future dollar/euro exchange rate (a future dollar depreciation) raises the expected dollar return on euro deposits; it thus shifts the downward-sloping schedule in the top part of Figure 15-13a to the right. The dollar depreciates against the euro, moving from an exchange rate of  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$  (point  $1'$ ) to  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2}$  (point  $2'$ ). Notice that the dollar depreciation is greater than it would be if the expected future dollar/euro exchange rate stayed fixed (as it might if the money supply increase were temporary rather than permanent). If the expectation  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{e}$  did not change, the new short-run equilibrium would be at point  $3'$  rather than at point  $2'$ .

Figure 15-13b shows how the interest rate and exchange rate behave as the price level rises during the economy's adjustment to its long-run equilibrium. The price level begins to rise from the initially given level  $P_{\mathrm{US}}^{1}$ , eventually reaching  $P_{\mathrm{US}}^{2}$ . Because the long-run increase in the price level must be proportional to the increase in the money supply, the final real money supply,  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^{2} / P_{\mathrm{US}}^{2}$ , is shown equal to the initial real money supply,  $M_{\mathrm{US}}^{1} / P_{\mathrm{US}}^{1}$ . Since output is given and the real money supply has returned to its original level, the equilibrium interest rate must again equal  $R_{\S}^{1}$  in the long run (point 4). The interest rate therefore rises from  $R_{\S}^{2}$  (point 2) to  $R_{\S}^{1}$  (point 4) as the price level rises from  $P_{\mathrm{US}}^{1}$  to  $P_{\mathrm{US}}^{2}$ .

The rising U.S. interest rate has exchange rate effects that can also be seen in Figure 15-13b: The dollar appreciates against the euro in the process of adjustment. If exchange rate expectations do not change further during the adjustment process, the foreign exchange market moves to its long-run position along the downward-sloping schedule defining the dollar return on euro deposits. The market's path is just the path traced out by the vertical dollar interest rate schedule as it moves rightward because of the price level's gradual rise. In the long run (point  $4'$ ), the equilibrium exchange rate,  $E_{\$/ \in}^{3}$ , is higher than at the original equilibrium, point  $1'$ . Like the price level, the dollar/euro exchange rate has risen in proportion to the increase in the money supply.

Figure 15-14 shows time paths like the ones just described for the U.S. money supply, the dollar interest rate, the U.S. price level, and the dollar/euro exchange rate. The figure is drawn so that the long-run increases in the price level (Figure 15-14c) and exchange rate (Figure 15-14d) are proportional to the increase in the money supply (Figure 15-14a).

# Exchange Rate Overshooting

In its initial depreciation after a money supply rise, the exchange rate jumps from  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{1}$  up to  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{2}$ , a depreciation greater than its long-run depreciation from  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{1}$  to  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{3}$  (see Figure 15-14d). The exchange rate is said to overshoot when its immediate response to a disturbance is greater than its long-run response. Exchange rate overshooting is an important phenomenon because it helps explain why exchange rates move so sharply from day to day.

The economic explanation of overshooting comes from the interest parity condition. The explanation is easiest to grasp if we assume that before the money supply

After the money supply increases at  $t_0$  in panel (a), the interest rate [in panel (b)], price level [in panel (c)], and exchange rate [in panel (d)] move as shown toward their long-run levels. As indicated in panel (d) by the initial jump from  $E_{\S/\epsilon}^1$  to  $E_{\S/\epsilon}^2$ , the exchange rate overshoots in the short run before settling down to its long-run level,  $E_{\S/\epsilon}^3$ .

increase first occurs, no change in the dollar/euro exchange rate is expected, so that  $R_{\mathbb{S}}^{1}$  equals  $R_{\infty}$ , the given interest rate on euro deposits. A permanent increase in the U.S. money supply doesn't affect  $R_{\infty}$ , so it causes  $R_{\mathbb{S}}^{1}$  to fall below  $R_{\infty}$  and remain below that interest rate (Figure 15-14b) until the U.S. price level has completed the long-run adjustment to  $P_{\mathrm{US}}^{2}$  shown in Figure 15-14c. For the foreign exchange market to be in equilibrium during this adjustment process, however, the interest difference in favor of euro deposits must be offset by an expected appreciation of the dollar against the euro, that is, by an expected fall in  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\infty}$ . Only if the dollar/euro exchange rate overshoots  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\infty}^{3}$  initially will market participants expect a subsequent appreciation of the dollar against the euro.

Overshooting is a direct consequence of the short-run rigidity of the price level. In a hypothetical world where the price level could adjust immediately to its new, long-run level after a money supply increase, the dollar interest rate would not fall because prices would adjust immediately and prevent the real money supply from rising. Thus, there would be no need for overshooting to maintain equilibrium in the foreign exchange market. The exchange rate would maintain equilibrium simply by jumping to its new, long-run level right away.

# CASE STUDY

# Inflation Targeting and Exchange Rate in Emerging Countries

All central banks are responsible for managing their monetary policy. They must therefore set parameters to formulate it. IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions defines a framework within which a country should target the inflation rate, the exchange rate anchor, and the monetary aggregate(s) as part of its monetary policy.

In emerging market economies, the role of monetary policy, which is often the sole economic policy due to the limits to fiscal policy in these countries, is all the more important as it is expected to simultaneously foster economic growth, price stability, and exchange rate stability. For this reason, the choice of inflation targeting is quite challenging for these countries.

Some empirical studies suggest that inflation targeting helps improve macroeconomic performance by keeping a check on both inflation and inflationary expectations while managing long-term interest rates. On the other hand, other studies found no evidence that suggests that inflation targeting enhances economic performance. This is particularly significant when it comes to interest rate management, which is the prime instrument of a central bank's monetary policy. It can have a notable contradictory effect when, in order to slow inflation, a central bank raises the interest rate but this increase slows GDP growth and attracts an inflow of foreign capital. This, in turn, puts pressure on the exchange rate. Similarly, a decrease in the interest rate could stimulate GDP growth, devalue the exchange rate, and feed inflation.

While the effectiveness of inflation targeting has been largely debated, a 2014 study by Samarina, Terpstra, and De Haan argues that the impact of inflation targeting can be segregated based on the stage of economic advancement a country is at. The authors found inflation targeting to have no effect for advanced economies but a significant negative impact for emerging market economies.

The Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions indicates that in 2014, 34 countries were found to be directly targeting inflation, and 19 of these countries could be classified as emerging market economies: Albania, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, and Uganda. In February 2015, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officially adopted inflation targeting as part of its monetary policy.

# INFLATION TARGETING AND EXCHANGE RATES

Since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1998 and the Latin American crises, many emerging market economies have abandoned their soft-pegged regimes in favor of more flexible exchange rate frameworks. Additionally, according to Ouyang and Rajan (2016),<sup>13</sup> a monetary policy based on inflation targeting is becoming increasingly popular around the world.

All inflation-targeting countries have either floating or free-floating exchange rate arrangements to avoid conflict with the management of interest rate.

In his speech before the South African Reserve Bank, John B. Taylor, who formulated the Taylor equation which was followed by central banks until the financial crisis, asserted that emerging market economies should stick to a rule-based approach to inflation targeting as opposed to a discretionary approach to achieve smoother adjustments and less volatility on an international level. Similarly, in a 2012 study, Vegh and Vuletin found that the adoption of rule-based inflation targeting by emerging market economies led to a reduction of large capital movements associated with the "fear of free falling" exchange rates. Eichengreen and Taylor's study from 2003 had a similar conclusion that associated low volatility in exchange rates with the adoption of inflation targeting.[14]

Addressing the concern shared by several Asian economies regarding exchange rate volatility and its effects on trade and investment, Ouyang and Rajan found that emerging market inflation targeting regimes in Asia face a lower rate of inflation compared to other emerging market economies in the continent. However, they also seemed to be experiencing a lower growth rate.

The impact of currency depreciation on internal prices (exchange rate pass through) has two components: an immediate impact through the rise of import prices and a "second round" impact, that is, the change in inflation expectations that affects prices and wages and creates a permanent effect on inflation.

The role of monetary policy in this situation is to successfully stabilize the medium-term expectations inflation to limit the impact of exchange rate pass-through.

It is reasonable to assume that if the central bank has created a robust price stability expectation through its inflation targeting policy, the second round effect would be limited.

The experience of Latin American emerging economies confirms this expectation. In its Regional Economic Outlook, Western Hemisphere (2016), the IMF concludes that the exchange rate pass-through in countries that target inflation is smaller. This gap is more pronounced in emerging market economies that target inflation as compared to emerging market economies that don't.

Since every economy has its own macroeconomic challenges, a single appropriate monetary policy is difficult to prescribe. For example, even in an inflation targeting economy, policymakers cannot be indifferent to the real exchange rate evolution. Emerging market economies are also moving toward a mixed inflation targeting strategy where their central banks manage both inflation and real exchange rates. Addressing the constraints that inflation targeting poses in the management of real exchange rates, Ostry, David, Ghosh, and Chamon conclude in their 2012 study that in such a scenario, another instrument of monetary policy would be foreign exchange intervention. This would match the two targets of monetary policy, inflation and exchange rate, with the number of instruments!

# SUMMARY

- People hold money because of its liquidity. When considered in real terms, aggregate money demand is not a demand for a certain number of currency units but is instead a demand for a certain amount of purchasing power. Aggregate real money demand depends negatively on the opportunity cost of holding money (measured by the domestic interest rate) and positively on the volume of transactions in the economy (measured by real GNP).
- The money market is in equilibrium when the real money supply equals aggregate real money demand. With the price level and real output given, a rise in the money supply lowers the interest rate and a fall in the money supply raises the interest rate. A rise in real output raises the interest rate, given the price level, while a fall in real output has the opposite effect.
- By lowering the domestic interest rate, an increase in the money supply causes the domestic currency to depreciate in the foreign exchange market (even when expectations of future exchange rates do not change). Similarly, a fall in the domestic money supply causes the domestic currency to appreciate against foreign currencies.
- The assumption that the price level is given in the short run is a good approximation to reality in countries with moderate inflation, but it is a misleading assumption over the long run. Permanent changes in the money supply push the long-run equilibrium price level proportionally in the same direction but do not influence the long-run values of output, the interest rate, or any relative prices. One important money price whose long-run equilibrium level rises in proportion to a permanent money supply increase is the exchange rate, the domestic currency price of foreign currency.
- An increase in the money supply can cause the exchange rate to overshoot its long-run level in the short run. If output is given, a permanent money supply increase, for example, causes a more-than-proportional short-run depreciation of the currency, followed by an appreciation of the currency to its long-run exchange rate. Exchange rate overshooting, which heightens the volatility of exchange rates, is a direct result of sluggish short-run price level adjustment and the interest parity condition.
