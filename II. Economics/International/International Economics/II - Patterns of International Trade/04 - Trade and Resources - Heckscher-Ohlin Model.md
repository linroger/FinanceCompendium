# Trade and Resources: The Heckscher-Ohlin Model

God did not bestow all products upon all parts of the earth, but distributed His gifts over different regions, to the end that men might cultivate a social relationship because one would have need of the help of another. And so He called commerce into being, that all men might be able to have common enjoyment of the fruits of the earth, no matter where produced.

Libanius (AD 314-393), Orations (III)

Nature, by giving a diversity of geniuses, climates, and soils, to different nations, has secured their mutual intercourse and commerce… . The industry of the nations, from whom they import, receives encouragement: Their own is also [i]ncased, by the sale of the commodities which they give in exchange.

David Hume, Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, 1752, Part II, Essay VI, "On the Jealousy of Trade"

2 Testing the Heckscher-Ohlin Model

3 Effects of Trade on Factor Prices

4 Conclusions

In Chapter 2, we examined U.S. imports of snowboards. We argued there that the resources found in a country would influence its pattern of international trade. Canada's export of snowboards to the United States reflects its mountains and cold climate, as do the exports of snowboards to the United States from Austria, Spain, Switzerland, Slovenia, Italy, Poland, and France. Because each country's resources are different and because resources are spread unevenly around the world, countries have a reason to trade the goods made with these resources. This is an old idea, as shown by the quotations at the beginning of this chapter; the first is from the fourth-century Greek scholar Libanius, and the second is from the eighteenth-century philosopher David Hume.

In this chapter, we outline the Heckscher-Ohlin model, a model that assumes that trade occurs because countries have different resources. This model contrasts with the Ricardian model, which assumed that trade occurs because countries use their technological comparative advantage to specialize in the production of different goods. The model is named after the Swedish economists Eli Heckscher, who wrote about his views of international trade in a 1919 article, and his student Bertil Ohlin, who further developed these ideas in his 1924 dissertation.

The Heckscher-Ohlin model was developed at the end of a "golden age" of international trade (as described in Chapter 1) that lasted from about 1890 until 1914, when World War I started. Those years saw dramatic improvements in transportation: the steamship and the railroad allowed for a great increase in the amount of international trade. For these reasons, there was a considerable increase in the ratio of trade to GDP between 1890 and 1914. It is not surprising, then, that Heckscher and Ohlin would want to explain the large increase in trade that they had witnessed in their own lifetimes. The ability to transport machines across borders meant that they did not look to differences in technologies across countries as the reason for trade, as Ricardo had done. Instead, they assumed that technologies were the same across countries, and they used the uneven distribution of resources across countries to explain trade patterns.

Even today, there are many examples of international trade driven by the land, labor, and capital resources found in each country. Canada, for example, has a large amount of land and therefore exports agricultural and forestry products, as well as petroleum; the United States, Western Europe, and Japan have many highly skilled workers and much capital and these countries export sophisticated services and manufactured goods; China and other Asian countries have a large number of workers and moderate but growing amounts of capital and they export less sophisticated manufactured goods; and so on. We study these and other examples of international trade in this chapter.

Our first goal is to describe the Heckscher-Ohlin model of trade. The specific-factors model that we studied in the previous chapter was a short-run model because capital and land could not move between the two industries we looked at. In contrast, the Heckscher-Ohlin model is a long-run model because all factors of production can move between industries. It is difficult to deal with three factors of production (labor, capital, and land) in both industries, so, instead, we assume that there are just two factors (labor and capital).

After predicting the long-run pattern of trade between countries using the Heckscher-Ohlin model, our second goal is to examine the empirical evidence on the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Although you might think it is obvious that a country's exports will be based on the resources the country has in abundance, it turns out that this prediction does not always hold true in practice. To obtain better predictions from the Heckscher-Ohlin model, we extend it in several directions, first by allowing for more than two factors of production and second by allowing countries to differ in their technologies, as in the Ricardian model. Both extensions make the predictions from the Heckscher-Ohlin model match more closely the trade patterns we see in the world economy today.

The third goal of the chapter is to investigate how the opening of trade between the two countries affects the payments to labor and to capital in each of them. We use the Heckscher-Ohlin model to predict which factor(s) gain when international trade begins and which factor(s) lose.

# 1 Heckscher-Ohlin Model

In building the Heckscher-Ohlin model, we suppose there are two countries, Home and Foreign, each of which produces two goods, computers and shoes, using two factors of production, labor and capital. Using symbols for capital  $(K)$  and labor  $(L)$ , we can add up the resources used in each industry to get the total for the economy. For example, the amount of capital Home uses in shoes  $K_{S}$ , plus the amount of capital used in computers  $K_{C}$ , adds up to the total capital available in the economy  $\overline{K}$ , so that  $K_{C} + K_{S} = \overline{K}$ . The same applies for Foreign:  $K_{C}^{*} + K_{S}^{*} = \overline{K}^{*}$ . Similarly, the amount of labor Home uses in shoes  $L_{S}$ , and the amount of labor used in computers  $L_{C}$ , add up to the total labor in the economy  $\overline{L}$ , so that  $L_{C} + L_{S} = \overline{L}$ . The same applies for Foreign:  $L_{C}^{*} + L_{S}^{*} = \overline{L}^{*}$ .

# Assumptions of the Heckscher-Ohlin Model

Because the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model describes the economy in the long run, its assumptions differ from those in the short-run specific-factors model of Chapter 3:

Assumption 1: Both factors can move freely between the industries.

This assumption implies that if both industries are actually producing, then capital must earn the same rental  $R$  in each of them. The reason for this result is that if capital earned a higher rental in one industry than the other, then all capital would move to the industry with the higher rental and the other industry would shut down. This result differs from the specific-factors model in which capital in manufacturing and land in agriculture earned different rentals in their respective industries. But like the specific-factor model, if both industries are producing, then all labor earns the same wage  $W$  in each of them.

Our second assumption concerns how the factors are combined to make shoes and computers:

Assumption 2: Shoe production is labor-intensive; that is, it requires more labor per unit of capital to produce shoes than computers, so that  $L_{S} / K_{S} > L_{C} / K_{C}$ .

Another way to state this assumption is to say that computer production is capital-intensive; that is, more capital per worker is used to produce computers than to produce shoes, so that  $K_{C} / L_{C} > K_{S} / L_{S}$ . The idea that shoes use more labor per unit of capital, and computers use more capital per worker, matches how most of us think about the technologies used in these two industries.

In Figure 4-1, the demands for labor relative to capital in each industry  $(L_{C} / K_{C}$  and  $L_{S} / K_{S})$  are graphed against the wage relative to the rental on capital,  $W / R$  (or the wage-rental ratio). These two curves slope down just like regular demand curves: as  $W / R$  rises, the quantity of labor demanded relative to the quantity of capital demanded falls. As we work through the HO model, remember that these are relative demand curves for labor; the "quantity" on the horizontal axis is the ratio of labor to capital used in production, and the "price" is the ratio of the labor wage to the capital rental. Assumption 2 says that the relative demand curve in shoes,  $L_{S} / K_{S}$  in Figure 4-1, lies to the right of the relative demand curve in computers  $L_{C} / K_{C}$ , because shoe production is more labor-intensive.

Whereas the preceding assumptions have focused on the production process within each country, the HO model requires assumptions that apply across countries as well. Our next assumption is that the amounts of labor and capital found in Home and Foreign are different:

# FIGURE 4-1

Labor Intensity of Each Industry The demand for labor relative to capital is assumed to be higher in shoes than in computers,  $L_{S} / K_{S} > L_{C} / K_{C}$ . These two curves slope down just like regular demand curves, but in this case, they are relative demand curves for labor (i.e., demand for labor divided by demand for capital).

[\frac{L}{k} < \frac{{L}^{ * }}{{k}^{ * }};\frac{k}{l} > \frac{{k}^{ * }}{{l}^{ * }}]

Foreign lao abondant

$$
\frac{l^{*}}{k^{*}} > \frac{l}{k}
$$

Assumption 3: Foreign is labor-abundant, by which we mean that the labor-capital ratio in Foreign exceeds that in Home,  $\overline{L}^{*} / \overline{K}^{*} > \overline{L} / \overline{K}$ . Equivalently, Home is capital-abundant, so that  $\overline{K} / \overline{L} > \overline{K}^{*} / \overline{L}^{*}$ .

There are many reasons for labor, capital, and other resources to differ across countries: countries differ in their geographic size and populations, previous waves of immigration or emigration may have changed a country's population, countries are at different stages of development and so have differing amounts of capital, and so on. If we are considering land in the HO model, Home and Foreign will have different amounts of usable land due to the shape of their borders and to differences in topography and climate. In building the HO model, we do not consider why the amounts of labor, capital, or land differ across countries but simply accept these differences as important determinants of why countries engage in international trade.

Assumption 3 focuses on a particular case, in which Foreign is labor-abundant and Home is capital-abundant. This assumption is true, for example, if Foreign has a larger workforce than Home  $(\overline{L}^{*} > \overline{L})$  and Foreign and Home have equal amounts of capital,  $\overline{K}^{*} = \overline{K}$ . Under these circumstances,  $\overline{L}^{*} / \overline{K}^{*} > \overline{L} / \overline{K}$ , so Foreign is labor-abundant. Conversely, the capital-labor ratio in Home exceeds that in Foreign,  $\overline{K} / \overline{L} > \overline{K}^{*} / \overline{L}^{*}$ , so the Home country is capital-abundant.

Assumption 4: The final outputs, shoes and computers, can be traded freely (i.e., without any restrictions) between nations, but labor and capital do not move between countries.

In this chapter, we do not allow labor or capital to move between countries. We relax this assumption in the next chapter, in which we investigate the movement of labor between countries through immigration as well as the movement of capital between countries through foreign direct investment.

Our final two assumptions involve the technologies of firms and tastes of consumers across countries:

Assumption 5: The technologies used to produce the two goods are identical across the countries.

This assumption is the opposite of that made in the Ricardian model (Chapter 2), which assumes that technological differences across countries are the reason for trade. It is not realistic to assume that technologies are the same across countries because often the technologies used in rich versus poor countries are quite different (as described in the following application). Although assumption 5 is not very realistic, it allows us to focus on a single reason for trade: the different amounts of labor and capital found in each country. Later in this chapter, we use data to test the validity of the HO model and find that the model performs better when assumption 5 is not used.

Our final assumption is as follows:

Assumption 6: Consumer tastes are the same across countries, and preferences for computers and shoes do not vary with a country's level of income.

That is, we suppose that a poorer country will buy fewer shoes and computers, but will buy them in the same ratio as a wealthier country facing the same prices. Again, this assumption is not very realistic: consumers in poor countries do spend more of their income on shoes, clothing, and other basic goods than on computers, whereas in rich countries a higher share of income can be spent on computers and other electronic goods than on footwear and clothing. Assumption 6 is another simplifying assumption that again allows us to focus attention on the differences in resources as the sole reason for trade.

# APPLICATION

# Are Factor Intensities the Same Across Countries?

One of our assumptions for the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model is that the same good (shoes) is labor-intensive in both countries. Specifically, we assume that in both countries, shoe production has a higher labor-capital ratio than does computer production. Although it might seem obvious that this assumption holds for shoes and computers, it is not so obvious when comparing other products, say, shoes and call centers.

In principle, all countries have access to the same technologies for making footwear. In practice, however, the machines used in the United States are different from those used in Asia and elsewhere. While much of the footwear in the world is produced in developing nations, the United States retains a small number of shoe factories. New Balance, which manufactures sneakers, has five plants in the New England states, and  $25\%$  of the shoes it sells in North America are produced in the United States. One of their plants is in Norridgewock, Maine, where employees operate computerized equipment that allows one person to do the work of six. This is a far cry from the plants in Asia that produce shoes for Nike, Reebok, and

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/e269b2087c69e940190b35378415820adb8b15d56764f67a571003a6f2b09cea.jpg)

Despite its nineteenth-century exterior, this New Balance factory in Maine houses advanced shoemanufacturing technology.

other U.S. producers. Because Asian plants use older technology (such as individual sewing machines), they use more workers to operate less productive machines.

In call centers, on the other hand, technologies (and, therefore, factor intensities) are similar across countries. Each employee works with a telephone and a personal computer, so call centers in the United States and India are similar in terms of the amount of capital per worker that they require. The telephone and personal computer, costing several thousand dollars, are much less expensive than the automated manufacturing machines in the New Balance plant in the United States, which cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. So the manufacture of footwear in the New Balance plant is capital-intensive as compared with a U.S. call center. In India, by contrast, the sewing machine used to produce footwear is cheaper than the computer used in the call center. So footwear production in India is labor-intensive as compared with the call center, which is the opposite of what holds in the United States. This example illustrates a reversal of factor intensities between the two countries.

The same reversal of factor intensities is seen when we compare the agricultural sector across countries. In the United States, agriculture is capital-intensive. Each farmer works with tens of thousands of dollars in mechanized, computerized equipment, allowing a farm to be maintained by only a handful of workers. In many developing countries, however, agriculture is labor-intensive. Farms are worked by many laborers with little or no mechanized equipment. The reason that this labor-intensive technology is used in agriculture in developing nations is that capital equipment is expensive relative to the wages earned.

In assumption 2 and Figure 4-1, we assume that the labor-capital ratio  $(L / K)$  of one industry exceeds that of the other industry regardless of the wagerental ratio  $(W / R)$ . That is, whether labor is cheap (as in a developing country) or expensive (as in the United States), we are assuming that the same industry (shoes, in our example) is labor-intensive in both countries. This assumption may not be true for footwear or for agriculture, as we have just seen. In our treatment of the HO model, we ignore the possibility of factor intensity reversals. The reason for ignoring these is to get a definite prediction from the model about the pattern of trade between countries so that we can see what happens to the price of goods and the earnings of factors when countries trade with one another.

# No-Trade Equilibrium

In assumption 3, we outlined the difference in the amount of labor and capital found at Home and in Foreign. Our goal is to use these differences in resources to predict the pattern of trade. To do this, we begin by studying the equilibrium in each country in the absence of trade.

Production Possibilities Frontiers To determine the no-trade equilibria in Home and Foreign, we start by drawing the production possibilities frontiers (PPFs) in each country as shown in Figure 4-2. Under our assumptions that Home is capital-abundant and that computer production is capital-intensive, Home is capable of producing more computers than shoes. The Home PPF drawn in panel (a) is skewed in the direction of computers to reflect Home's greater capability to produce computers. Similarly, because Foreign is labor-abundant and shoe production is labor-intensive, the Foreign PPF shown in panel (b) is skewed in the direction of shoes, reflecting Foreign's greater capability to produce shoes. These particular shapes for the PPFs are reasonable given the assumptions we have made. When we continue our study of the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model in Chapter 5, we prove that the PPFs must take

No-Trade Equilibria in Home and Foreign The Home production possibilities frontier (PPF) is shown in panel (a), and the Foreign PPF is shown in panel (b). Because Home is capital-abundant and computers are capital-intensive, the Home PPF is skewed toward computers. Home preferences are summarized by the indifference curve,  $U$ , and the Home no-trade (or autarky) equilibrium is at point  $A$ , with a low relative price of computers, as indicated by the flat slope of  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{A}$ . Foreign is labor-abundant and shoes are labor-intensive, so the Foreign PPF is skewed toward shoes. Foreign preferences are summarized by the indifference curve,  $U^{*}$ , and the Foreign no-trade equilibrium is at point  $A^{*}$ , with a higher relative price of computers, as indicated by the steeper slope of  $(P_{C}^{*} / P_{S}^{*})^{A^{*}}$ .

$$ this shape. $^2$  For now, we accept these shapes of the PPF and use them as the starting point for our study of the HO model.


Indifference Curves Another assumption of the HO model (assumption 6) is that consumer tastes are the same across countries. As we did in the Ricardian model, we graph consumer tastes using indifference curves. Two of these curves are shown in Figure 4-2 ( $U$  and  $U^{*}$  for Home and Foreign, respectively); one is tangent to Home's PPF, and the other is tangent to Foreign's PPF. Notice that these indifference curves are the same shape in both countries, as required by assumption 6. They are tangent to the PPFs at different points because of the distinct shapes of the PPFs just described.

The slope of an indifference curve equals the amount that consumers are willing to pay for computers measured in terms of shoes rather than dollars. The slope of the PPF equals the opportunity cost of producing one more computer in terms of shoes given up. When the slope of an indifference curve equals the slope of a PPF, the relative price that consumers are willing to pay for computers equals the opportunity cost of producing them, so this point is the no-trade equilibrium. The common slope of the indifference curve and PPF at their tangency equals the relative price of computers  $P_{C} / P_{S}$ . A steeply sloped price line implies a high relative price of computers, whereas a flat price line implies a low relative price for computers.

$$

S t e e p p r i c e l i v e m i p l o s s a r e a t a n a l y h i g h p r i c e o f (a m p r i c e -)

$$

No-Trade Equilibrium Price Given the differently shaped PPFs, the indifference curves of each country will be tangent to the PPFs at different production points, corresponding to different relative price lines across the two countries. In Home, the no-trade or autarky equilibrium is shown by point  $A$ , at which Home produces  $Q_{C1}$  of computers and  $Q_{S1}$  of shoes at the relative price of  $(P_C / P_S)^A$ . Because the Home PPF is skewed toward computers, the slope of the Home price line  $(P_C / P_S)^A$  is quite flat, indicating a low relative price of computers. In Foreign, the no-trade or autarky equilibrium is shown by point  $A^*$  at which Foreign produces  $Q_{C1}^*$  of computers and  $Q_{S1}^*$  of shoes at the relative price of  $(P_C^* / P_S^*)^{A^*}$ . Because the Foreign PPF is skewed toward shoes, the slope of the Foreign price line  $(P_C^* / P_S^*)^{A^*}$  is quite steep, indicating a high relative price of computers. Therefore, the result from comparing the no-trade equilibria in Figure 4-2 is that the no-trade relative price of computers at Home is lower than in Foreign. (Equivalently, we can say that the no-trade relative price of shoes at Home is higher than in Foreign.)

These comparisons of the no-trade prices reflect the differing amounts of labor found in the two countries: the Foreign country has abundant labor, and shoe production is labor-intensive, so the no-trade relative price of shoes is lower in Foreign than in Home. That Foreigners are willing to give up more shoes for one computer reflects the fact that Foreign resources are suited to making more shoes. The same logic applies to Home, which is relatively abundant in capital. Because computer production is capital-intensive, Home has a lower no-trade relative price of computers than Foreign. Thus, Home residents need to give up fewer shoes to obtain one computer, reflecting the fact that their resources are suited to making more computers.

# Free-Trade Equilibrium

We are now in a position to determine the pattern of trade between the countries. To do so, we proceed in several steps. First, we consider what happens when the world relative price of computers is above the no-trade relative price of computers at Home, and trace out the Home export supply of computers. Second, we consider what happens when the world relative price is below the no-trade relative price of computers in Foreign, and trace out the Foreign import demand for computers. Finally, we put together the Home export supply and Foreign import demand to determine the equilibrium relative price of computers with international trade.

Home Equilibrium with Free Trade The first step is displayed in Figure 4-3. We have already seen in Figure 4-2 that the no-trade relative price of computers is lower in Home than in Foreign. Under free trade, we expect the equilibrium relative price of computers to lie between the no-trade relative prices in each country (as we already found in the Ricardian model of Chapter 2). Because the no-trade relative price of computers is lower at Home, the free-trade equilibrium price will be above the no-trade price at Home. Therefore, panel (a) of Figure 4-3 shows the Home PPF with a free-trade or world relative price of computers,  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ , higher than the no-trade Home relative price,  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{A}$ , shown in panel (a) of Figure 4-2.

The no-trade equilibrium at Home, point  $A$ , has the quantities  $(Q_{C1}, Q_{S1})$  for computers and shoes, shown in Figure 4-2. At the higher world relative price of computers, Home production moves from point  $A$ ,  $(Q_{C1}, Q_{S1})$ , to point  $B$  in Figure 4-3,  $(Q_{C2}, Q_{S2})$ , with more computers and fewer shoes. Thus, with free trade, Home produces fewer shoes and specializes further in computers to take advantage of higher world relative prices of computers. Because Home can now engage in trade at the world relative price,

# FIGURE 4-3

International Free-Trade Equilibrium at Home At the free-trade world relative price of computers,  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ , Home produces at point  $B$  in panel (a) and consumes at point  $C$ , exporting computers and importing shoes. (Point  $A$  is the no-trade equilibrium.) The "trade triangle" has a base equal to the Home exports of computers (the difference between the amount produced

(b) International Market and the amount consumed with trade,  $Q_{C2} - Q_{C3}$ . The height of this triangle is the Home imports of shoes (the difference between the amount consumed of shoes and the amount produced with trade,  $Q_{S3} - Q_{S2}$ ). In panel (b), we show Home exports of computers equal to zero at the no-trade relative price,  $(P_C / P_S)^A$  and equal to  $(Q_{C2} - Q_{C3})$  at the free-trade relative price,  $(P_C / P_S)^W$ .
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/83a84138f666b1eb6cc2fc6a4a33cf226fc1c4fd9b2d9dc14dd38c63ee0cdd9f.jpg)

Home's consumption can now lie on any point along the world price line through  $B$  with slope  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ . The highest Home utility is obtained at point  $C$ , which is tangent to the world price line  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$  and has the quantities consumed  $(Q_{C3}, Q_{S3})$ .

We can now define the Home "trade triangle," which is the triangle connecting points  $B$  and  $C$ , shown in panel (a) of Figure 4-3. Point  $B$  is where Home is producing and point  $C$  is where it is consuming, and the line connecting the two points represents the amount of trade at the world relative price. The base of this triangle is the Home exports of computers (the difference between the amount produced and the amount consumed with trade, or  $Q_{C2} - Q_{C3}$ ). The height of this triangle is the Home imports of shoes (the difference between the amount consumed of shoes and the amount produced with trade, or  $Q_{S3} - Q_{S2}$ ).

In panel (b) of Figure 4-3, we graph the Home exports of computers against their relative price. In the no-trade equilibrium, the Home relative price of computers was  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{A}$ , and exports of computers were zero. This no-trade equilibrium is shown by point  $A$  in panel (b). Under free trade, the relative price of computers is  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ , and exports of computers are the difference between the amount produced and amount consumed with trade, or  $(Q_{C2} - Q_{C3})$ . This free-trade equilibrium is shown by point  $D$  in panel (b). Joining up points  $A$  and  $D$ , we obtain the Home export supply curve of computers. It is upward-sloping because at higher relative prices as compared with the no-trade price, Home is willing to specialize further in computers to export more of them.

Foreign Equilibrium with Free Trade We proceed in a similar fashion for the Foreign country. In panel (a) of Figure 4-4, the Foreign no-trade equilibrium is at point  $A^{*}$ , with the high equilibrium relative price of computers  $(P_{C}^{*} / P_{S}^{*})^{A^{*}}$ . Because the Foreign no-trade relative price was higher than at Home, and we expect the free-trade relative price to lie between, it follows that the free-trade or world equilibrium price of computers  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$  is lower than the no-trade Foreign price  $(P_{C}^{*} / P_{S}^{*})^{A^{*}}$ .

At the world relative price, Foreign production moves from point  $A^{*}$ ,  $(Q_{C1}^{*}, Q_{S1}^{*})$  to point  $B^{*}$ ,  $(Q_{C2}^{*}, Q_{S2}^{*})$ , with more shoes and fewer computers. Thus, with free trade, Foreign specializes further in shoes and produces fewer computers. Because Foreign can now engage in trade at the world relative price, Foreign's consumption can now lie on any point along the world price line through  $B^{*}$  with slope  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ . The highest Foreign utility is obtained at point  $C^{*}$ , which is tangent to the world price line  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$  and has the quantities consumed  $(Q_{C3}^{*}, Q_{S3}^{*})$ . Once again, we can connect points  $B^{*}$  and  $C^{*}$  to form a "trade triangle." The base of this triangle is Foreign imports of computers (the difference between consumption of computers and production with trade, or  $Q_{C3}^{*} - Q_{C2}^{*}$ ), and the height is Foreign exports of shoes (the difference between production and consumption with trade, or  $Q_{S2}^{*} - Q_{S3}^{*}$ ).

International Free-Trade Equilibrium in Foreign At the free-trade world relative price of computers,  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ , Foreign produces at point  $B^{*}$  in panel (a) and consumes at point  $C^{*}$ , importing computers and exporting shoes. (Point  $A^{*}$  is the no-trade equilibrium.) The "trade triangle" has a base equal to Foreign imports of computers (the difference between the consumption of computers and the amount produced with trade,  $Q_{C3}^{*} - Q_{C2}^{*}$ . The height of this triangle is Foreign exports of shoes (the difference between the production of shoes and the amount consumed with trade,  $Q_{S2}^{*} - Q_{S3}^{*}$ ). In panel (b), we show Foreign imports of computers equal to zero at the no-trade relative price,  $(P_{C}^{*} / P_{S}^{*})^{A^{*}}$  and equal to  $(Q_{C3}^{*} - Q_{C2}^{*})$  at the free-trade relative price,  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ .


In panel (b) of Figure 4-4, we graph Foreign's imports of computers against its relative price. In the no-trade equilibrium, the Foreign relative price of computers was  $(P_C^* / P_S^*)^{A^*}$ , and imports of computers were zero. This no-trade equilibrium is shown by the point  $A^*$  in panel (b). Under free trade, the relative price of computers is  $(P_C / P_S)^W$ , and imports of computers are the difference between the amount produced and amount consumed with trade, or  $(Q_{C3}^* - Q_{C2}^*)$ . This free-trade equilibrium is shown by the point  $D^*$  in panel (b). Joining up points  $A^*$  and  $D^*$ , we obtain the Foreign import demand curve for computers. It is downward-sloping because at lower relative prices as compared with no-trade, Foreign specializes more in shoes and exports these in exchange for computers.

Equilibrium Price with Free Trade As we see in Figure 4-5, the equilibrium relative price of computers with free trade is determined by the intersection of the Home export supply and Foreign import demand curves, at point  $D$  (the same as point  $D$  in Figure 4-3 or  $D^{*}$  in Figure 4-4). At that relative price, the quantity of computers that the Home country wants to export equals the quantity of computers that Foreign wants to import; that is,  $(Q_{C2} - Q_{C3}) = (Q_{C3}^{*} - Q_{C2}^{*})$ . Because exports equal imports, there is no reason for the relative price to change and so this is a free-trade equilibrium. Another way to see the equilibrium graphically is to notice that in panel (a) of Figures 4-3 and 4-4, the trade triangles of the two countries are identical in size—the quantity of computers one country wants to sell is the same as the quantity the other country wants to buy.

Pattern of Trade Using the free-trade equilibrium, we have determined the pattern of trade between the two countries. Home exports computers, the good that uses intensively the factor of production (capital) found in abundance at Home. Foreign exports shoes, the good that uses intensively the factor of production (labor) found in abundance there. This important result is called the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem.

FIGURE 4-5
Relative price of computers,  $P_{C} / P_{S}$

Determination of the Free-Trade World Equilibrium Price The world relative price of computers in the free-trade equilibrium is determined at the intersection of the Home export supply and Foreign import demand, at point  $D$ . At this relative price, the quantity of computers that Home wants to export,  $(Q_{C2} - Q_{C3})$ , just equals the quantity of computers that Foreign wants to import,  $(Q_{C3}^{*} - Q_{C2}^{*})$ .

Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem: With two goods and two factors, each country will export the good that uses intensively the factor of production it has in abundance and will import the other good.

It is useful to review the assumptions we made at the beginning of the chapter to see how they lead to the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem.

Assumption 1: Labor and capital flow freely between the industries.

Assumption 2: The production of shoes is labor-intensive as compared with computer production, which is capital-intensive.

Assumption 3: The amounts of labor and capital found in the two countries differ, with Foreign abundant in labor and Home abundant in capital.

Assumption 4: There is free international trade in goods.

Assumption 5: The technologies for producing shoes and computers are the same across countries.

Assumption 6: Tastes are the same across countries.

Assumptions 1 to 3 allowed us to draw the PPFs of the two countries as illustrated in Figure 4-2, and in conjunction with assumptions 5 and 6, they allowed us to determine that the no-trade relative price of computers in Home was lower than the no-trade relative price of computers in Foreign; that is,  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{A}$  was less than  $(P_{C}^{*} / P_{S}^{*})^{A^{*}}$ . This key result enabled us to determine the starting points for the Home export supply curve for computers (point  $A$ ) and the Foreign import demand curve for computers (point  $A^{*}$ ) in panel (b) of Figures 4-3 and 4-4. Using those starting points, we put together the upward-sloping Home export supply curve and downward-sloping Foreign import demand curve. We see from Figure 4-5 that the relative price of computers in the free-trade equilibrium lies between the no-trade relative prices (which confirms the expectation we had when drawing Figures 4-3 and 4-4).

Therefore, when Home opens to trade, its relative price of computers rises from the no-trade equilibrium relative price  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{A}$ , to the free-trade equilibrium price  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ , giving Home firms an incentive to export computers. That is, higher prices give Home an incentive to produce more computers than it wants to consume, and export the difference. Similarly, when Foreign opens to trade, its relative price of computers falls from the no-trade equilibrium price  $(P_{C}^{*} / P_{S}^{*})^{A^{*}}$ , to the trade equilibrium price  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ , encouraging Foreign consumers to import computers from Home. That is, lower prices give Foreign an incentive to consume more computers than it wants to produce, importing the difference.

You might think that the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem is somewhat obvious. It makes sense that countries will export goods that are produced easily because the factors of production are found in abundance. It turns out, however, that this prediction does not always work in practice, as we discuss in the next section.

# 2 Testing the Heckscher-Ohlin Model

The first test of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem was performed by economist Wassily Leontief in 1953, using data for the United States from 1947. We will describe his test below and show that he reached a surprising conclusion, which is called Leontief's paradox. After that, we will discuss more recent data for many countries that can be used to test the Heckscher-Ohlin model.

# Leontief's Paradox

To test the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, Leontief measured the amounts of labor and capital used in all industries needed to produce  \$1 million of U.S. exports and to produce\$ 1 million of imports into the United States. His results are shown in Table 4-1.

Leontief first measured the amount of capital and labor required in the production of  \$1 million worth of U.S. exports. To arrive at these figures, Leontief measured the labor and capital used directly in the production of final good exports in each industry. He also measured the labor and capital used indirectly in the industries that produced the intermediate inputs used in making the exports. From the first row of Table 4-1, we see that\$ 2.55 million worth of capital was used to produce 1 million of exports. This amount of capital seems much too high, until we recognize that what is being measured is the total stock, which exceeds that part of the capital stock that was actually used to produce exports that year: the capital used that year would be measured by the depreciation on this stock. For labor, 182 person-years were used to produce the exports. Taking the ratio of these, we find that each person employed (directly or indirectly) in producing exports was working with 14,000 worth of capital.


Turning to the import side of the calculation, Leontief immediately ran into a problem—he could not measure the amount of labor and capital used to produce imports because he didn't have data on foreign technologies. To get around this difficulty, Leontief did what many researchers have done since—he simply used the data on U.S. technology to calculate estimated amounts of labor and capital used in imports from abroad. Does this approach invalidate Leontief's test of the Heckscher-Ohlin model? Not really, because the Heckscher-Ohlin model assumes that technologies are the same across countries, so Leontief is building this assumption into the calculations needed to test the theorem.

Using U.S. technology to measure the labor and capital used directly and indirectly in producing imports, Leontief arrived at the estimates in the last column of Table 4-1:  \$3.1 million of capital and 170 person-years were used in the production of\$ 1 million worth of U.S. imports, so the capital-labor ratio for imports was  \$18,200 per worker. Notice that this amount exceeds the capital-labor ratio for exports of\$ 14,000 per worker.

Leontief supposed correctly that in 1947 the United States was abundant in capital relative to the rest of the world. Thus, from the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, Leontief expected that the United States would export capital-intensive goods and import labor-intensive goods. What Leontief actually found, however, was just the opposite: the capital-labor ratio for U.S. imports was higher than the capital-labor ratio found for U.S. exports! This finding contradicted the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem and came to be called Leontief's paradox.

Explanations A wide range of explanations has been offered for Leontief's paradox, including the following:

U.S. and foreign technologies are not the same, in contrast to what the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem and Leontief assumed.

# TABLE 4-1

Leontief's Test Leontief used the numbers in this table to test the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. Each column shows the amount of capital or labor needed to produce 1 million worth of exports from, or imports into, the United States in 1947. As shown in the last row, the capital-labor ratio for exports was less than the capital-labor ratio for imports, which is a paradoxical finding.

By focusing only on labor and capital, Leontief ignored land abundance in the United States.
- Leontief should have distinguished between high-skilled and low-skilled labor (because it would not be surprising to find that U.S. exports are intensive in high-skilled labor).
The data for 1947 may be unusual because World War II had ended just two years earlier.
The United States was not engaged in completely free trade, as the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem assumes.

Several of the additional possible explanations for the Leontief paradox depend on having more than two factors of production. The United States is abundant in land, for example, and that might explain why in 1947 it was exporting labor-intensive products: these might have been agricultural products, which use land intensively and, in 1947, might also have used labor intensively. By ignoring land, Leontief was therefore not performing an accurate test of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. Alternatively, it might be that the United States was mainly exporting goods that used skilled labor. This is certainly true today, with the United States being a leading exporter of high-technology products, and was probably also true in 1947. By not distinguishing between high-skilled versus low-skilled labor, Leontief was again giving an inaccurate picture of the factors of production used in U.S. trade.

Research in later years aimed to redo the test that Leontief performed, while taking into account land, high-skilled versus low-skilled labor, checking whether the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem holds in other years, and so on. We now discuss the data that can be used to test the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem in a more recent year—2010.

# Factor Endowments in 2010

In Figure 4-6, we show the country shares of six factors of production and world GDP in 2010, broken down by select countries (the United States, China, Japan, India, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada) and then the rest of the world. To determine whether a country is abundant in a certain factor, we compare the country's share of that factor with its share of world GDP. If its share of a factor exceeds its share of world GDP, then we conclude that the country is abundant in that factor, and if its share in a certain factor is less than its share of world GDP, then we conclude that the country is scarce in that factor. This definition allows us to calculate factor abundance in a setting with as many factors and countries as we want.

Capital Abundance For example, in the first bar graph of Figure 4-6, we see that in 2010,  $17.1\%$  of the world's physical capital was located in the United States, with  $16.9\%$  located in China,  $7.7\%$  in Japan,  $3.9\%$  in India,  $4.3\%$  in Germany, and so on. When we compare these numbers with the final bar in the graph, which shows each country's percentage of world GDP, we see that in 2010 the United States had  $19.1\%$  of world GDP, China had  $14.4\%$ , Japan  $5.6\%$ , India  $6.1\%$ , Germany  $4.0\%$ , and so on. Because the United States had  $17.1\%$  of the world's capital and  $19.1\%$  of world GDP, we can conclude that the United States was scarce in physical capital in 2010. China, on the other hand, is abundant in physical capital: it has  $16.9\%$  of the world's capital and produces  $14.4\%$  of the world's GDP. Indeed, it is the rapid accumulation

FIGURE 4-6

Country Factor Endowments, 2010 Shown here are country shares of six factors of production in the year 2010, for eight selected countries and the rest of the world. In the first bar graph, we see that  $17.1\%$  of the world's physical capital in 2010 was located in the United States, with  $16.9\%$  located in China,  $7.7\%$  located in Japan, and so on. In the final bar graph, we see that in 2010 the United States had  $19.1\%$  of world GDP, China had  $14.4\%$ , Japan had  $5.6\%$ , and so on. When a country's factor share is larger than its share of GDP, then the country is abundant in that factor, and when a country's factor share is less than its share of GDP, then the country is scarce in that factor.

of capital in China during the past decade that has now made the United States relatively scarce in this factor (because as China accumulates more capital, the U.S. share of the world's capital falls). Japan had  $7.7\%$  of the world's capital and  $5.6\%$  of world GDP in 2010, so it was also abundant in capital, as was Germany (with  $4.3\%$  of the world's capital and  $4.0\%$  of world GDP). The opposite holds for India, and the group of countries included in the rest of the world: their shares of world capital were less than their shares of GDP, so they were scarce in capital.

Labor and Land Abundance We can use a similar comparison to determine whether each country is abundant in R&D scientists, in types of labor distinguished by skill, in arable land, or any other factor of production. For example, the United States was abundant in R&D scientists in 2010 (with  $21.4\%$  of the world's total as compared with  $19.1\%$  of the world's GDP) and also skilled labor (workers with more than a high school education) but was scarce in less-skilled labor (workers with a high school education or less) and illiterate labor. India was scarce in R&D scientists (with  $2.6\%$  of the world's total as compared with  $6.1\%$  of the world's GDP) but abundant in skilled labor, semiskilled labor, and illiterate labor (with shares of the world's total that exceed its GDP share). Canada was abundant in arable land (with  $3.3\%$  of the world's total as compared with  $1.7\%$  of the world's GDP), as we would expect. But the United States was scarce in arable land ( $11.8\%$  of the world's total as compared with  $19.1\%$  of the world's GDP). That is a surprising result because we often think of the United States as a major exporter of agricultural commodities, so from the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, we would expect it to be land-abundant.

Another surprising result in Figure 4-6 is that China was abundant in R&D scientists: it had  $20.0\%$  of the world's R&D scientists, as compared with  $14.4\%$  of the world's GDP in 2010. This finding also seems to contradict the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, because we think of China as exporting greater quantities of basic manufactured goods, not research-intensive manufactured goods. These observations regarding R&D scientists (a factor in which both the United States and China were abundant) and land (in which the United States was scarce) can cause us to question whether an R&D scientist or an acre of arable land has the same productivity in all countries. If not, then our measures of factor abundance are misleading: if an R&D scientist in the United States is more productive than his or her counterpart in China, then it does not make sense to just compare each country's share of these with each country's share of GDP; and likewise, if an acre of arable land is more productive in the United States than in other countries, then we should not compare the share of land in each country with each country's share of GDP. Instead, we need to make some adjustment for the differing productivities of R&D scientists and land across countries. In other words, we need to abandon the original Heckscher-Ohlin assumption of identical technologies across countries.

# Differing Productivities Across Countries

Leontief himself suggested that we should abandon the assumption that technologies are the same across countries and instead allow for differing productivities, as in the Ricardian model. Remember that in the original formulation of the paradox, Leontief had found that the United States was exporting labor-intensive products even though it was capital-abundant at that time. One explanation for this outcome would be that labor is highly productive in the United States and less productive in the rest of the world. If that is the case, then the effective labor force in the United States, the labor force times its productivity (which measures how much output the labor force can produce), is much larger than it appears to be when we just count people. If this is true, perhaps the United States is abundant in skilled labor after all (like R&D scientists), and it should be no surprise that it is exporting labor-intensive products.

We now explore how differing productivities can be introduced into the Heckscher-Ohlin model. In addition to allowing labor to have a differing productivity across countries, we can also allow capital, land, and other factors of production to have differing productivity across countries.


Measuring Factor Abundance Once Again To allow factors of production to differ in their productivities across countries, we define the effective factor endowment as the actual amount of a factor found in a country times its productivity:

Effective factor endowment = Actual factor endowment  $\cdot$  Factor productivity

The amount of an effective factor found in the world is obtained by adding up the effective factor endowments across all countries. Then to determine whether a country is abundant in a certain factor, we compare the country's share of that effective factor with its share of world GDP. If its share of an effective factor exceeds its share of world GDP, then we conclude that the country is abundant in that effective factor; if its share of an effective factor is less than its share of world GDP, then we conclude that the country is scarce in that effective factor. We can illustrate this approach to measuring effective factor endowments using two examples: R&D scientists and arable land.

Effective R&D Scientists The productivity of an R&D scientist depends on the laboratory equipment, computers, and other types of material with which he or she has to work. R&D scientists working in different countries will not necessarily have the same productivities because the equipment they have available to them differs. A simple way to measure the equipment they have available is to use a country's R&D spending per scientist. If a country has more R&D spending per scientist, then its productivity will be higher, but if there is less R&D spending per scientist, then its productivity will be lower. To measure the effective number of R&D scientists in each country, we take the total number of scientists and multiply that by the R&D spending per scientist:

Effective R&D scientists = Actual R&D scientists  $\cdot$  R&D spending per scientist

Using the R&D spending per scientist in this way to obtain effective R&D scientists is one method to correct for differences in the productivity of scientists across countries. It is not the only way to make such a correction because there are other measures that could be used for the productivity of scientists (e.g., we could use scientific publications available in a country, or the number of research universities). The advantage of using R&D spending per scientist is that this information is collected annually for many countries, so using this method to obtain a measure of effective R&D scientists means that we can easily compare the share of each country with the world total. Those shares are shown in Figure 4-7.

In the first bar graph of Figure 4-7, we repeat from Figure 4-6 each country's share of world R&D scientists, not corrected for productivity differences. In the second bar graph, we show each country's share of effective scientists, using the R&D spending per scientist to correct for productivity. The United States had  $21.4\%$  of the world's total R&D scientists in 2010 (in the first bar) but  $24.8\%$  of the world's effective scientists (in the second bar). So the United States was more abundant in effective R&D

"Effective" Factor Endowments, 2010 Shown here are country shares of R&D scientists and land in 2010, using first the information from Figure 4-6, and then making an adjustment for the productivity of each factor across countries to obtain the "effective" shares. China was abundant in R&D scientists in 2010 (since it had  $20.0\%$  of the world's R&D scientists as compared with  $14.4\%$  of the world's GDP) but scarce in effective R&D scientists (because it had  $9.9\%$  of the world's effective R&D scientists as compared with  $14.4\%$  of the world's GDP). The United States was scarce in arable land when using the number of acres (since it had  $11.8\%$  of the world's land as compared with  $19.1\%$  of the world's GDP) but neither scarce nor abundant in effective land (since it had  $20.0\%$  of the world's effective land, which nearly equaled its share of the world's GDP).

scientists in 2010 than it was in the number of scientists. Likewise, Germany had a greater share of effective scientists,  $5.3\%$ , as compared with its share of R&D scientists, which was  $4.3\%$ . But China's share of R&D scientists fell by half when correcting for productivity, from a  $20.0\%$  share in the number of R&D scientists to a  $9.9\%$  share in effective R&D scientists. Since China's share of world GDP was  $14.4\%$  in 2010, it became scarce in effective R&D scientists once we made this productivity correction.

China has increased its spending on R&D in recent years and now exceeds the level of R&D spending in Japan. It is also investing heavily in universities, many of which offer degrees in science and engineering. Even when compared with the United

States, China is taking the lead in some areas of R&D. An example is in research on "green" technologies, such as wind and solar power. We will discuss government subsidies in China for solar panels in a later chapter. As described in Headlines: China Drawing High-Tech Research from U.S., the Silicon Valley firm Applied Materials has recently established a research laboratory in China and has many contracts to sell solar equipment there. Applied Materials was attracted to China by a combination of inexpensive land and skilled labor. For all these reasons, we should expect that China's share of effective R&D scientists will grow significantly in future years.

Effective Arable Land As we did for R&D scientists, we also need to correct arable land for its differing productivity across countries. To make this correction, we use a measure of agricultural productivity in each country. Then the effective amount of arable land found in a country is

Effective arable land = Actual arable land  $\cdot$  Productivity in agriculture

# HEADLINES

# China Drawing High-Tech Research from U.S.

Applied Materials, a well-known firm in Silicon Valley, recently announced plans to establish a large laboratory in Xi'an, China, as described in this article.

XI'AN, China—For years, many of China's best and brightest left for the United States, where high-tech industry was more cutting-edge. But Mark R. Pinto is moving in the opposite direction. Mr. Pinto is the first chief technology officer of a major American tech company to move to China. The company, Applied Materials, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent firms. It supplied equipment used to perfect the first computer chips. Today, it is the world's biggest supplier of the equipment used to make semiconductors, solar panels and flat-panel displays.

In addition to moving Mr. Pinto and his family to Beijing in January, Applied Materials, whose headquarters are in Santa Clara, Calif., has just built its newest and largest research labs here. Last week, it even held its an nual shareholders' meeting in Xi'an. It is hardly alone. Companies—and their engineers—are being drawn here more and more as China develops a high-tech economy that increasingly competes directly with the United States. . . .


Not just drawn by China's markets, Western companies are also attracted to China's huge reservoirs of cheap, highly skilled engineers—and the subsidies offered by many Chinese cities and regions, particularly for green energy companies. Now, Mr. Pinto said, researchers from the United States and Europe have to be ready to move to China if they want to do cutting-edge work on solar manufacturing because the new Applied Materials complex here is the only research center that can fit an entire solar panel assembly line. "If you really want to have an impact on this field, this is just such a tremendous laboratory," he said. . .


Locally, the Xi'an city government sold a 75-year land lease to Applied Materials at a deep discount and is reimbursing the company for roughly a quarter of the lab complex's operating costs for five years, said Gang Zou, the site's general manager. The two labs, the first of their kind anywhere in the world, are each bigger than two American football fields. Applied Materials continues to develop the electronic guts of its complex machines at laboratories in the United States and Europe. But putting all the machines together and figuring out processes to make them work in unison will be done in Xi'an. The two labs, one on top of the other, will become operational once they are fully outfitted late this year. . . .

We will not discuss here the exact method for measuring productivity in agriculture, except to say that it compares the output in each country with the inputs of labor, capital, and land: countries with higher output as compared with inputs are the more productive, and countries with lower output as compared with inputs are the less productive. The United States has very high productivity in agriculture, whereas China has lower productivity.

In the third bar graph of Figure 4-7, we repeat from Figure 4-6 each country's share of arable land, not corrected for productivity differences. In the fourth bar graph, we show each country's share of effective arable land in 2010, corrected for productivity differences. The United States had  $11.8\%$  of the world's total arable land (in the third bar), as compared with  $19.1\%$  of the world's GDP (in the final bar), so it was scarce in land in 2010 without making any productivity correction. But when measured by effective arable land, the United States had  $20.0\%$  of the world's total (in the fourth bar), as compared with  $19.1\%$  of the world's GDP (in the final bar). These two numbers are so close that we should conclude the United States was neither abundant nor scarce in effective arable land: its share of the world's total approximately equaled its share of the world's GDP.

How does this conclusion compare with U.S. trade in agriculture? We often think of the United States as a major exporter of agricultural goods, but this pattern is changing. In Table 4-2, we show the U.S. exports and imports of food products and total agricultural trade. This table shows that U.S. food trade has fluctuated between positive and negative net exports since 2000, which is consistent with our finding that the United States is neither abundant nor scarce in land. Total agricultural trade (including nonfood items like cotton) continues to have positive net exports, however.

# Leontief's Paradox Once Again

Our discussion of factor endowments in 2010 shows that it is possible for countries to be abundant in more that one factor of production: the United States and Japan are both abundant in physical capital and R&D scientists, and the United States is also abundant in skilled labor (see Figure 4-6). We have also found that it is sometimes important to correct that actual amount of a factor of production for its productivity, obtaining the effective factor endowment. Now we can apply these ideas to the United States in 1947 to reexamine the Leontief paradox.

Using a sample of 30 countries for which GDP information is available in 1947, the U.S. share of those countries' GDP was  $37\%$ . That estimate of the U.S. share of "world" GDP is shown in the last bar graph of Figure 4-8. To determine whether the United States was abundant in physical capital or labor, we need to estimate its share of the world endowments of these factors.

Capital Abundance It is hard to estimate the U.S. share of the world capital stock in the postwar years. But given the devastation of the capital stock in Europe and Japan due to World War II, we can presume that the U.S. share of world capital was more than  $37\%$ . That estimate (or really a "guesimate") means that the U.S. share of world capital exceeds the U.S. share of world GDP, so that the United States was abundant in capital in 1947.

Labor Abundance What about the abundance of labor for the United States? If we do not correct labor for productivity differences across countries, then the population

Labor Endowment and GDP for the United States and Rest of World,

1947 Shown here are the share of labor, "effective" labor, and GDP of the United States and the rest of the world (measured by 30 countries for which data are available) in 1947. The United States had only  $8\%$  of the world's population, as compared with  $37\%$  of the world's GDP, so it was very scarce in labor. But when we measure effective labor by the total wages paid in each country, then the United States had  $43\%$  of the world's effective labor as compared with  $37\%$  of GDP, so it was abundant in effective labor.

of each country is a rough measure of its labor force. The U.S. share of population for the sample of 30 countries in 1947 was very small, about  $8\%$ , which is shown in the first bar graph of Figure 4-8. This estimate of labor abundance is much less than the U.S. share of GDP,  $37\%$ . According to that comparison, the United States was scarce in labor (its share of that factor was less than its share of GDP).

Labor Productivity Using the U.S. share of population is not the right way to measure the U.S. labor endowment, however, because it does not correct for differences in the productivity of labor across countries. A good way to make that correction is to use wages paid to workers as a measure of their productivity. To illustrate why this is a good approach, in Figure 4-9 we plot the wages of workers in various countries and the estimated productivity of workers in 1990. The vertical axis in Figure 4-9 measures wages earned across a sample of 33 countries, measured relative to (i.e., as a percentage of) the United States. Only one country—Canada—has wages higher than those in the United States (probably reflecting greater union pressure in that country). All other countries have lower wages, ranging from Austria and Switzerland

Labor Productivity and Wages Shown here are estimated labor productivities across countries, and their wages, relative to the United States in 1990. Notice that the labor and wages were highly correlated across countries: the points roughly line up along the 45-degree line. This close connection between wages and labor productivity holds for the data in 1990, and we expect that it also held in 1947, so that we can use wages to adjust for labor productivity in explaining the Leontief paradox.

with wages that are about  $95\%$  of the U.S. wage, to Ireland, France, and Finland, with wages at about  $50\%$  of the U.S. level, to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, with wages at about  $5\%$  of the U.S. level.

The horizontal axis in Figure 4-9 measures labor productivity in various countries relative to that in the United States. For example, labor productivity in Canada is  $80\%$  of that in the United States; labor productivity in Austria and New Zealand is about  $60\%$  of that in the United States; and labor productivity in Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh is about  $5\%$  of that in the United States. Notice that the labor productivities (on the horizontal axis) and wages (on the vertical axis) are highly correlated across countries: the points in Figure 4-9 line up approximately along the 45-degree line. This close connection between wages and labor productivity holds for the data in 1990 and, we expect that it also held in 1947, so that we can use wages to adjust for labor productivity in explaining the Leontief Paradox.

Effective Labor Abundance As suggested by Figure 4-9, wages across countries are strongly correlated with the productivity of labor. Going back to the data for 1947, which Leontief used, we use the wages earned by labor to measure the productivity of labor in each country. Then the effective amount of labor found in each country equals the actual amount of labor times the wage. Multiplying the amount of labor in each country by average wages, we obtain total wages paid to labor. That information is available for 30 countries in 1947, and we have already found that the United States accounted for  $37\%$  of the GDP of these countries, as shown in the final bar in Figure 4-8. Adding up total wages paid to labor across the 30 countries and comparing it with the United States, we find that the United States accounted for  $43\%$  of wages paid to labor in these 30 countries, as shown in the bar labeled "effective" labor. By comparing this estimate with the United States share of world GDP of  $37\%$  in 1947, we see that the United States was abundant in effective labor, taking into account the differing productivity of labor across countries. So not only was the United States abundant in capital, it was also abundant in effective—or skilled—labor in 1947, just as we have also found for the year 2010!

Summary In Leontief's test of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, he found that the capital-labor ratio for exports from the United States in 1947 was less than the capital-labor ratio for imports. That finding seemed to contradict the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem if we think of the United States as being capital-abundant: in that case, it should be exporting capital-intensive goods (with a high capital-labor ratio). But now we have found that the United States was abundant in both capital and labor in 1947, once we correct for the productivity of labor by using its wage. Basically, the relatively low population and number of workers in the United States are boosted upward by high U.S. wages, making the effective labor force seem much larger—large enough so that the U.S. share of worldwide wages even exceeds its share of GDP.

Such a finding means the United States was also abundant in effective—or skilled—labor in 1947, just as it is today. Armed with this finding, it is not surprising that Leontief found exports from the United States in 1947 used relatively less capital and more labor than did imports: that pattern simply reflects the high productivity of labor in the United States and its abundance of this effective factor. As Leontief himself proposed, once we take into account differences in the productivity of factors across countries, there is no "paradox" after all, at least in the data for 1947. For more recent years, too, taking account of factor productivity differences across countries is important when testing the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem.

# 3 Effects of Trade on Factor Prices

In the Heckscher-Ohlin model developed in the previous sections, Home exported computers and Foreign exported shoes. Furthermore, we found in our model that the relative price of computers rose at Home from the no-trade equilibrium to the trade equilibrium (this higher relative price with trade is why computers are exported). Conversely, the relative price of computers fell in Foreign from the no-trade equilibrium to the trade equilibrium (this lower relative price with trade is why computers are imported abroad). The question we ask now is how the changes in the relative prices of goods affect the wage paid to labor in each country and the rental earned by capital. We begin by showing how the wage and rental are determined, focusing on Home.

# Effect of Trade on the Wage and Rental of Home

To determine the wage and rental, we go back to Figure 4-1, which showed that the quantity of labor demanded relative to the quantity of capital demanded in each industry at Home depends on the relative wage at Home  $W / R$ . We can use these relative demands for labor in each industry to derive an economy-wide relative demand for labor, which can then be compared with the economy-wide relative supply of labor  $\overline{L} / \overline{K}$ . By comparing the economy-wide relative demand and supply, just as we do in any supply and demand context, we can determine Home's relative wage. Moreover, we can evaluate what happens to the relative wage when the Home relative price of computers rises after Home starts trading.

Economy-Wide Relative Demand for Labor To derive an economy-wide relative demand for labor, we use the conditions that the quantities of labor and capital used in each industry add up to the total available labor and capital:  $L_{C} + L_{S} = \overline{L}$  and  $K_{C} + K_{S} = \overline{K}$ . We can divide total labor by total capital to get

$$

\underbrace{\frac{\overline{L}}{\overline{K}}}_{\substack{\text{Relative}\\ \text{supply}}} = \underbrace{\frac{L_{C} + L_{S}}{\overline{K}}}_{\substack{\text{Relative}\\ \text{demand}}} = \underbrace{\frac{L_{C}}{K_{C}}\cdot\left(\frac{K_{C}}{\overline{K}}\right) + \frac{L_{S}}{K_{S}}\cdot\left(\frac{K_{S}}{\overline{K}}\right)}_{\substack{\text{Relative}\\ \text{demand}}}

$$

The left-hand side of this equation is the economy-wide supply of labor relative to capital, or relative supply. The right-hand side is the economy-wide demand for labor relative to capital, or relative demand. The relative demand is a weighted average of the labor-capital ratio in each industry. This weighted average is obtained by multiplying the labor-capital ratio for each industry,  $L_{C} / K_{C}$  and  $L_{S} / K_{S}$ , by the terms  $K_{C} / \overline{K}$  and  $K_{S} / \overline{K}$ , the shares of total capital employed in each industry. These two terms must add up to 1,  $(K_{C} / \overline{K}) + (K_{S} / \overline{K}) = 1$ , because capital must be employed in one industry or the other.

The determination of Home's equilibrium relative wage is shown in Figure 4-10 as the intersection of the relative supply and relative demand curves. The supply of labor relative to the supply of capital, the relative supply  $(\overline{L} / \overline{K})$ , is shown as a vertical line because the total amounts of labor and capital do not depend on the relative wage; they are fixed by the total amount of factor resources in each country. Because the relative demand (the  $RD$  curve in the graph) is an average of the  $L_{C} / K_{C}$  and  $L_{S} / K_{S}$  curves from Figure 4-1, it therefore lies between these two curves. The point at which relative demand intersects relative supply, point  $A$ , tells us that the wage relative to

FIGURE 4-10

Determination of Home Wage/Rental The economy-wide relative demand for labor,  $RD$ , is an average of the  $L_{C} / K_{C}$  and  $L_{S} / K_{S}$  curves and lies between these curves. The relative supply,  $\overline{L} / \overline{K}$ , is shown by a vertical line because the total amount of resources in Home is fixed. The equilibrium point  $A$ , at which relative demand  $RD$  intersects relative supply  $\overline{L} / \overline{K}$ , determines the wage relative to the rental,  $W / R$ .

the rental is  $W / R$  (from the vertical axis). Point  $A$  describes an equilibrium in the labor and capital markets and combines these two markets into a single diagram by showing relative supply equal to relative demand.

Increase in the Relative Price of Computers When Home opens itself to trade, it faces a higher relative price of computers; that is,  $P_{C} / P_{S}$  increases at Home. We illustrate this higher relative price using Home's production possibilities frontier in Figure 4-11. At the no-trade or autarky equilibrium, point  $A$ , the relative price of computers is  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{A}$  and the computer industry produces  $Q_{C1}$ , while the shoe

FIGURE 4-11

Increase in the Price of Computers Initially, Home is at a no-trade equilibrium at point  $A$  with a relative price of computers of  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{A}$ . An increase in the relative price of computers to the world price, as illustrated by the steeper world price line,  $(P_{C} / P_{S})^{W}$ , shifts production from point  $A$  to  $B$ . At point  $B$ , there is a higher output of computers and a lower output of shoes,  $Q_{C2} > Q_{C1}$  and  $Q_{S2} < Q_{S1}$ .

industry produces  $Q_{S1}$ . With a rise in the relative price of computers to  $(P_C / P_S)^W$ , the computer industry increases its output to  $Q_{C2}$ , and the shoe industry decreases its output to  $Q_{S2}$ . With this shift in production, labor and capital both move from shoe production to computer production. What is the effect of these resource movements on the relative supply and relative demand for labor?

The effects are shown in Figure 4-12. Relative supply  $\overline{L} / \overline{K}$  is the same as before because the total amounts of labor and capital available in Home have not changed. The relative demand for labor changes, however, because capital has shifted to the computer industry. This shift affects the terms used in the weighted average:  $(K_{C} / \overline{K})$  rises and  $(K_{S} / \overline{K})$  falls. The relative demand for labor in the economy is now more weighted toward computers and less weighted toward the shoe industry. In Figure 4-12, the change in the weights shifts the relative demand curve from  $RD_{1}$  to  $RD_{2}$ . The curve shifts in the direction of the relative demand curve for computers, and the equilibrium moves from point  $A$  to  $B$ .

The impacts on all the variables are as follows. First, the relative wage  $W / R$  falls from  $(W / R)_1$  to  $(W / R)_2$ , reflecting the fall in the relative demand for labor as both factors move into computer production from shoe production. Second, the lower relative wage induces both industries to hire more workers per unit of capital (a move down along their relative demand curves). In the shoe industry, for instance, the new, lower relative wage  $(W / R)_2$  intersects the relative demand curve for labor  $L_S / K_S$  at a point

FIGURE 4-12

Effect of a Higher Relative Price of Computers on Wage/ Rental An increase in the relative price of computers shifts the economy-wide relative demand for labor,  $RD_{1}$ , toward the relative demand for labor in the computer industry,  $L_{C} / K_{C}$ . The new relative demand curve,  $RD_{2}$ , intersects the relative supply curve for labor at a lower relative wage  $(W / R)_{2}$ . As a result, the wage relative to the rental falls from  $(W / R)_{1}$  to  $(W / R)_{2}$ . The lower relative wage causes both industries to increase their labor-capital ratios, as illustrated by the increase in both  $L_{C} / K_{C}$  and  $L_{S} / K_{S}$  at the new relative wage.

corresponding to a higher  $L / K$  level than the initial relative wage  $(W / R)_1$ . That is,  $(L_S / K_S)_2 > (L_S / K_S)_1$ , and the same argument holds for the computer industry. As a result, the labor-capital ratio rises in both shoes and computers.

How is it possible for the labor-capital ratio to rise in both industries when the amount of labor and capital available in total is fixed? The answer is that more labor per unit of capital is released from shoes than is needed to operate that capital in computers (because computers require fewer workers per machine). As the relative price of computers rises, computer output rises while shoe output falls, and labor is "freed up" to be used more in both industries. In terms of our earlier equation for relative supply and relative demand, the changes in response to the increase in the relative price of computers  $P_{C} / P_{S}$  are

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/c313e3454d3ca5f777a34fe7f13634790f8ef8be4aed283ef4becad885ade249.jpg)

The relative supply of labor has not changed, so relative demand for labor cannot change overall. Since some of the individual components of relative demand have increased, other components must decrease to keep the overall relative demand the same. After the rise in the price of computers, even more capital will be used in the computer industry ( $K_{C} / \overline{K}$  rises while  $K_{S} / \overline{K}$  falls) because the output of computers rises and the output of shoes falls. This shift in weights on the right-hand side pulls down the overall relative demand for labor (this is necessarily true since  $L_{C} / K_{C} < L_{S} / K_{S}$  by assumption). But because the relative supply on the left-hand side doesn't change, another feature must increase the relative demand for labor: this feature is the increased labor-capital ratios in both industries. In this way, relative demand continues to equal relative supply at point  $B$ , and at the same time, the labor-capital ratios have risen in both industries.

# Determination of the Real Wage and Real Rental

To summarize, we have found that an increase in the relative price of computers—which are capital-intensive—leads to a fall in the relative wage  $(W / R)$ . In turn, the decrease in the relative wage leads to an increase in the labor-capital ratio used in each industry  $(L_{C} / K_{C}$  and  $L_{S} / K_{S})$ . Our goal in this section is to determine who gains and who loses from these changes. For this purpose, it is not enough to know how the relative wage changes; instead, we want to determine the change in the real wage and real rental; that is, the change in the quantity of shoes and computers that each factor of production can purchase. With the results we have already obtained, it will be fairly easy to determine the change in the real wage and real rental.

Change in the Real Rental Because the labor-capital ratio increases in both industries, the marginal product of capital also increases in both industries. This is because there are more people to work with each piece of capital. This result follows from our earlier argument that when a machine has more labor to work it, it will be more productive, and the marginal product of capital will go up. In both industries, the rental on capital is determined by its marginal product and by the prices of the goods:


$$

R = P_{C} \cdot M P K_{C} \text{an d} R = P_{S} \cdot M P K_{S}

$$

Because capital can move freely between industries in the long run, the rental on capital is equalized across them. By using the result that both marginal products of capital increase and by rearranging the previous equations, we see that

$$

M P K_{C} = R / P_{C} \uparrow \text{an d} M P K_{S} = R / P_{S} \uparrow

$$

Remember that  $R / P_{C}$  measures that quantity of computers that can be purchased with the rental, whereas  $R / P_{S}$  measures the quantity of shoes that can be bought with the rental. When both of these go up, the real rental on capital (in terms of either good) increases. Therefore, capital owners are clearly better off when the relative price of computers increases. Notice that computer manufacturing is the capital-intensive industry, so the more general result is that an increase in the relative price of a good will benefit the factor of production used intensively in producing that good.

Change in the Real Wage To understand what happens to the real wage when the relative price of computers rises, we again use the result that the labor-capital ratio increases in both industries. The law of diminishing returns tells us that the marginal product of labor must fall in both industries (since there are more workers on each machine). In both industries, the wage is determined by the marginal product of labor and the prices of the goods:

$$

W = P_{C} \cdot M P L_{C} \text{an d} W = P_{S} \cdot M P L_{S}

$$

Using the result that the marginal product of labor falls in both industries, we see that

$$

M P L_{C} = W / P_{C} \downarrow \text{an d} M P L_{S} = W / P_{S} \downarrow

$$

Therefore, the quantity of computers that can be purchased with the wage  $(W / P_{C})$  and the quantity of shoes that can be purchased with the wage  $(W / P_{S})$  both fall. These decreases mean that the real wage (in terms of either good) is reduced, and labor is clearly worse off because of the increase in the relative price of computers.

We can summarize our results with the following theorem, first derived by economists Wolfgang Stolper and Paul Samuelson.

Stolper-Samuelson Theorem: In the long run, when all factors are mobile, an increase in the relative price of a good will increase the real earnings of the factor used intensively in the production of that good and decrease the real earnings of the other factor.

For our example, the Stolper-Samuelson theorem predicts that when Home opens to trade and faces a higher relative price of computers, the real rental on capital in Home rises and the real wage in Home falls. In Foreign, the changes in real factor prices are just the reverse. When Foreign opens to trade and faces a lower relative price of computers, the real rental falls and the real wage rises. Remember that Foreign is abundant in labor, so our finding that labor is better off there, but worse off at Home, means that workers in the labor-abundant country gain from trade but workers in the capital-abundant country lose. In addition, capital in the capital-abundant country (Home) gains, and capital in the labor-abundant country losses. These results are sometimes summarized by saying that in the Heckscher-Ohlin model, the abundant factor gains from trade, and the scarce factor loses from trade.


# Changes in the Real Wage and Rental: A Numerical Example

To illustrate the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, we use a numerical example to show how much the real wage and rental can change in response to a change in price. Suppose that the computer and shoe industries have the following data:

Computers: Sales revenue  $= P_{C} \cdot Q_{C} = 100$

Earnings of labor  $= W\cdot L_{C} = 50$

Earnings of capital  $= R\cdot K_{C} = 50$

Shoes: Sales revenue  $= P_{S} \cdot Q_{S} = 100$

Earnings of labor  $= W\cdot L_{S} = 60$

Earnings of capital  $= R\cdot K_{S} = 40$

Notice that shoes are more labor-intensive than computers: the share of total revenue paid to labor in shoes  $(60 / 100 = 60\%)$  is more than that share in computers  $(50 / 100 = 50\%)$ .

When Home and Foreign undertake trade, the relative price of computers rises. For simplicity we assume that this occurs because the price of computers  $P_{C}$  rises, while the price of shoes  $P_{S}$  does not change:

Computers: Percentage increase in price  $= \Delta P_{C} / P_{C} = 10\%$

Shoes: Percentage increase in price  $= \Delta P_{S} / P_{S} = 0\%$

Our goal is to see how the increase in the relative price of computers translates into long-run changes in the wage  $W$  paid to labor and the rental on capital  $R$ . Remember that the rental on capital can be calculated by taking total sales revenue in each industry, subtracting the payments to labor, and dividing by the amount of capital. This calculation gives us the following formulas for the rental in each industry:

$$

R = \frac{P_{C} \cdot Q_{C} - W \cdot L_{C}}{K_{C}}, \text{fo rc om pu te rs}

$$

$$

R = \frac{P_{S} \cdot Q_{S} - W \cdot L_{S}}{K_{S}}, \text{fo rs ho es}

$$

The price of computers has risen, so  $\Delta P_{C} > 0$ , holding fixed the price of shoes,  $\Delta P_{S} = 0$ . We can trace through how this affects the rental by changing  $P_{C}$  and  $W$  in the previous two equations:

$$

\Delta R = \frac{\Delta P_{C} \cdot Q_{C} - \Delta W \cdot L_{C}}{K_{C}}, \text{fo rc om pu te rs}

$$

$$

\Delta R = \frac{0 \cdot Q_{C} - \Delta W \cdot L_{S}}{K_{S}}, \text{fo rs ho es}

$$

It is convenient to work with percentage changes in the variables. For computers,  $\Delta P_{C} / P_{C}$  is the percentage change in price. Similarly,  $\Delta W / W$  is the percentage change in the wage, and  $\Delta R / R$  is the percentage change in the rental of capital. We can introduce these terms into the preceding formulas by rewriting them as

$$

\frac{\Delta R}{R} = \left(\frac{\Delta P_{C}}{P_{C}}\right) \left(\frac{P_{C} \cdot Q_{C}}{R \cdot K_{C}}\right) - \left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right) \left(\frac{W \cdot L_{C}}{R \cdot K_{C}}\right), \text{fo rc om pu te rs}

$$

$$

\frac{\Delta R}{R} = - \left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right) \left(\frac{W \cdot L_{S}}{R \cdot K_{S}}\right), \text{fo rs ho es}

$$

(You should cancel terms in these equations to check that they are the same as before.) Now we'll plug the above data for shoes and computers into these formulas:

$$

\frac{\Delta R}{R} = 10 \% \cdot \left(\frac{100}{50}\right) - \left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right) \left(\frac{50}{50}\right), \text{forcomputers}

$$

$$

\frac{\Delta R}{R} = - \left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right) \left(\frac{6 0}{4 0}\right), \text{fo rs ho es}

$$

Our goal is to find out by how much rental and wage change given changes in the relative price of the final goods, so we are trying to solve for two unknowns  $(\Delta R / R$  and  $\Delta W / W)$  from the two equations given here. A good way to do this is to reduce the two equations with two unknowns into a single equation with one unknown. This can be done by subtracting one equation from the other, as follows:

$$

\frac{\Delta R}{R} = 10 \% \cdot \left(\frac{100}{50}\right) - \left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right) \left(\frac{50}{50}\right), \text{forcomputers}

$$

Minus:  $\frac{\Delta R}{R} = 0 - \left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right)\left(\frac{60}{40}\right)$ , for shoes

$$

\text{Equals:} \quad 0 = 10 \% \cdot \left(\frac{100}{50}\right) + \left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right) \left(\frac{20}{40}\right)

$$

Simplifying the last line, we get  $0 = 20\% + \left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ , so that

$$

\left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right) = \left(\frac{- 20 \%}{\frac{1}{2}}\right) = - 40 \%, \text{isthechangeinwages}

$$

So when the price of computers increases by  $10\%$ , the wage falls by  $40\%$ . With the wage falling, labor can no longer afford to buy as many computers  $(W / P_{C}$  has fallen since  $W$  is falling and  $P_{C}$  has increased) or as many pairs of shoes  $(W / P_{S}$  has fallen since  $W$  is falling and  $P_{S}$  has not changed). In other words, the real wage measured in terms of either good has fallen, so labor is clearly worse off.

To find the change in the rental paid to capital  $(\Delta R / R)$ , we can take our solution for  $\Delta W / W = -40\%$ , and plug it into the equation for the change in the rental in the shoes sector:

$$

\frac{\Delta R}{R} = - \left(\frac{\Delta W}{W}\right) \left(\frac{60}{40}\right) = 40 \% \cdot \left(\frac{60}{40}\right) = 60 \%, \text{changeinrental}

$$

The rental on capital increases by  $60\%$  when the price of computers rises by  $10\%$ , so the rental increases even more (in percentage terms) than the price. Because the rental increases by more than the price of computers in percentage terms, it follows that  $(R / P_{C})$  rises: owners of capital can afford to buy more computers, even though their price has gone up. In addition, they can afford to buy more shoes ( $R / P_{S}$  also rises, since  $R$  rises and  $P_{S}$  is constant). Thus, the real rental measured in terms of either good has gone up, and capital owners are clearly better off.

General Equation for the Long-Run Change in Factor Prices The long-run results of a change in factor prices can be summarized in the following equation:

$$

\underbrace {\Delta W / W <   0}_{<   \Delta P_{C} / P_{C} <   \Delta R / R}, \text{fo ra ni nc re as ei n} P_{C}

$$

Real wage falls

Real rental increases

That is, the increase in the price of computers (10\%) leads to an even larger increase in the rental on capital (60\%) and a decrease in the wage (-40\%). If, instead, the price of computers falls, then these inequalities are reversed, and we get

$$

\underbrace {\Delta R / R <   \Delta P_{C}} / \underbrace {P_{C} <   0 <   \Delta W / W}_{\text{fo ra nd ec re as ei n} P_{C}}

$$

Real rental falls

Real wage increases

What happens if the relative price of shoes increases? From the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, we know that this change will benefit labor, which is used intensively in shoe production, and will harm capital. The equation summarizing the changes in factor earnings when the price of shoes increases is

$$

\underline {{\Delta R / R <   0}} \underline {{<   \Delta P_{S} / P_{S} <   \Delta W / W}}, \text{fo ra ni nc re as ei n} P_{S}

$$

Real rental falls

Real wage increases

These equations relating the changes in product prices to changes in factor prices are sometimes called the "magnification effect" because they show how changes in the prices of goods have magnified effects on the earnings of factors: even a modest fluctuation in the relative prices of goods on world markets can lead to exaggerated changes in the long-run earnings of both factors. This result tells us that some groups—those employed intensively in export industries—can be expected to support opening an economy to trade because an increase in export prices increases their real earnings. But other groups—those employed intensively in import industries—can be expected to oppose free trade because the decrease in import prices decreases their real earnings. The following application examines the opinions that different factors of production have taken toward free trade.

# APPLICATION

# Opinions Toward Free Trade

Countries sometimes conduct a survey about their citizens' attitudes toward free trade. A survey conducted in the United States by the National Elections Studies (NES) in 1992 included the following question:

Some people have suggested placing new limits on foreign imports in order to protect American jobs. Others say that such limits would raise consumer prices and hurt American exports. Do you favor or oppose placing limits on imports, or haven't you thought much about this?

Respondents to the survey could either answer that they "favor" placing limits on imports, meaning that they do not support free trade, or that they "oppose" limits on imports, meaning that they support free trade. How do these answers compare with characteristics of the respondents, such as their wages, skills, or the industries in which they work?

According to the specific-factors model, in the short run we do not know whether labor will gain or lose from free trade, but we do know that the specific factor in the export sector gains, and the specific factor in the import sector loses. Think about an extension of this model, in which, in addition to their wage, labor also earns some part of the rental on the specific factor in their industry. This assumption is true for farmers, for example, who work in agriculture and may own their land; it can also be true for workers in manufacturing if their salary includes a bonus that is based on the profits earned by capital. In those situations, we would expect that workers in export industries will support free trade (since the specific factor in that industry gains), but workers in import-competing industries will be against free trade (since the specific factor in that industry loses). In the short run, then, the industry of employment of workers will affect their attitudes toward free trade.

In the long-run Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model, however, the industry of employment should not matter. According to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, an increase in the relative price of exports will benefit the factor of production used intensively in exports and harm the other factor, regardless of the industry in which these factors of production actually work (remember that each factor of production earns the same wage or rental across industries in the long run). In the United States, export industries tend to use high-skilled labor intensively for research and development and other scientific work. An increase in the relative price of exports will benefit high-skilled labor in the long run, regardless of whether these workers are employed in export-oriented industries or import-competing industries. Conversely, an increase in the relative price of exports will harm low-skilled labor, regardless of where these workers are employed. In the long run, then, the skill level of workers should determine their attitudes toward free trade.

In the 1992 NES survey, the industry of employment was somewhat important in explaining the respondents' attitudes toward free trade, but their skill level was much more important. That is, workers in export-oriented industries are somewhat more likely to favor free trade, with those in import-competing industries favoring import restrictions, but this statistical relationship is not strong. A much more important determinant of the attitudes toward free trade is the skill level of workers, as measured by their wages or their years of education. Workers with lower wages or fewer years of education are more likely to favor import restrictions, whereas those with higher wages and more years of education favor free trade. This finding suggests that the respondents to the survey are basing their answer on their long-run earnings, as predicted by the HO model and Stolper-Samuelson theorem, rather than on their short-run industry of employment, as predicted by the specific-factors model.


There is an interesting extension to these findings, however. The survey also asked respondents whether they owned a home. It turns out that people who own homes in communities in which the local industries face a lot of import competition are much more likely to oppose free trade. Examples of this are towns in the northeastern states where people have been employed by textile mills, or in the midwestern states where people have been employed by automobile, steel, and other heavy industries. But people who own homes in communities in which the industries benefit from export opportunities, such as the high-tech areas in Boston or in Silicon Valley, California, are much more likely to support free trade. We can think of a house as a specific factor, since it cannot move locations. So the attitudes in this part of the NES survey conform to the short-run specific-factors model: people are very concerned about the asset value of their homes, just as the owners of specific factors in our model are concerned about the rental earned by the factor of production they own.

# 4 Conclusions

The Heckscher-Ohlin framework is one of the most widely used models in explaining trade patterns. It isolates the effect of different factor endowments across countries and determines the impact of these differences on trade patterns, relative prices, and factor returns. This approach is a major departure from the view that technology differences determine trade patterns as we saw in the Ricardian model and is also a departure from the short-run specific-factors model that we studied in Chapter 3.

In this chapter, we have investigated some empirical tests of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem; that is, tests to determine whether countries actually export the goods that use their abundant factor intensively. The body of literature testing the theorem originates in Leontief's puzzling finding that U.S. exports just after World War II were relatively labor-intensive. Although the original formulation of his test did not seem to support the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, later research has reformulated the test to measure the effective endowments of labor, capital, and other factors found in each country. Using this approach, we found that the United States was abundant in effective labor, and we also presume that it was abundant in capital. The United States had a positive factor content of net exports for both labor and capital in 1947, which is consistent with the finding of Leontief, so there was really no "paradox" after all.

By focusing on the factor intensities among goods (i.e., the relative amount of labor and capital used in production), the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model also provides clear guidance as to who gains and who loses from the opening of trade. In the specific-factors model, an increase in the relative price of a good leads to real gains for the specific factor used in that industry, losses for the other specific factor, and an ambiguous change in the real wage for labor. In contrast, the HO model predicts real gains for the factor used intensively in the export good, whose relative price goes up with the opening of trade, and real losses for the other factor. Having just two factors, both of which are fully mobile between the industries, leads to a very clear prediction about who gains and who loses from trade in the long run.

# KEY POINTS

1. In the Heckscher-Ohlin model, we assume that the technologies are the same across countries and that countries trade because the available resources (labor, capital, and land) differ across countries.
2. The Heckscher-Ohlin model is a long-run framework, so labor, capital, and other resources can move freely between the industries.
3. With two goods, two factors, and two countries, the Heckscher-Ohlin model predicts that a country will export the good that uses its abundant factor intensively and import the other good.
4. The first test of the Heckscher-Ohlin model was made by Leontief using U.S. data for 1947. He found that U.S. exports were less capital-intensive and more labor-intensive than U.S. imports. This was a paradoxical finding because the United States was abundant in capital.
5. The assumption of identical technologies used in the Heckscher-Ohlin model does not hold in practice. Current research has extended the empirical tests of the Heckscher-Ohlin model to allow for many factors and countries, along with differing productivities of factors across countries. When we allow for different productivities of labor in 1947, we find that the United States is abundant in effective—or skilled—labor, which explains the Leontief paradox.


6. According to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, an increase in the relative price of a good will cause the real earnings of labor and capital to move in opposite directions: the factor used intensively in the industry whose relative price goes up will find its earnings increased, and the real earnings of the other factor will fall.
7. Putting together the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem and the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, we conclude that a country's abundant factor gains from the opening of trade (because the relative price of exports goes up), and its scarce factor loses from the opening of trade.

2. Leontief's paradox is an example of testing a trade model using actual data observations. If

Leontief had observed that the amount of labor needed per 1 million of U.S. exports was 100 person-years instead of 182, would he have reached the same conclusion? Explain.

3. Suppose there are drastic technological improvements in shoe production at Home such that shoe factories can operate almost completely with computer-aided machines. Consider the following data for the Home country:

Computers: Sales revenue  $= P_{C}Q_{C} = 100$

Payments to labor  $= WL_{C} = 50$

Payments to capital  $= RK_{C} = 50$

Percentage increase in the price  $= \Delta P_{C} / P_{C} = 0\%$

Shoes: Sales revenue  $= P_{S}Q_{S} = 100$

Payments to labor  $= W L_{S} = 5$

Payments to capital  $= RK_{S} = 95$

d. Which factor gains in real terms, and which factor loses? Are these results consistent with the Stolper-Samuelson theorem?

4. Using the information in the chapter, suppose Home doubles in size, while Foreign remains the same. Show that an equal proportional increase in capital and labor at Home will change the relative price of computers, wage, rental on capital, and the amount traded but not the pattern of trade.
5. Using a diagram similar to Figure 4-12, show the effect of a decrease in the relative price of computers in Foreign. What happens to the wage relative to the rental? Is there an increase in the labor-capital ratio in each industry? Explain.

6. Suppose when Russia opens to trade, it imports automobiles, a capital-intensive good.

d. Which group (capital owner or labor) would support policies to limit free trade? Briefly explain.

7. In Figure 4-3, we show how the movement from the no-trade equilibrium point  $A$  to a trade equilibrium at a higher relative price of computers leads to an upward-sloping export supply, from points  $A$  to  $D$  in panel (b).

a. Suppose that the relative price of computers continues to rise in panel (a), and label the production and consumption points at several higher prices.
b. In panel (b), extend the export supply curve to show the quantity of exports at the higher relative prices of computers.
c. What happens to the export supply curve when the price of computers is high enough? Can you explain why this happens? Hint: An increase in the relative price of a country's export good means that the country is richer because its terms of trade have improved. Explain how that can lead to fewer exports as their price rises.

8. On March 2, 2013, Tajikistan successfully negotiated terms to become a member of the World Trade Organization. Consequently, countries such as those in western Europe are shifting toward free trade with Tajikistan.
