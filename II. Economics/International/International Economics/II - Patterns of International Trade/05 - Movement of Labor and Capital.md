# Movement of Labor and Capital Between Countries

Amidst growing dissent, housing and job shortages as well as a plummeting economy, Cuban Premier Fidel Castro withdrew his guards from the Peruvian embassy in Havana on April 4, 1980… . Less than 48 hours after the guards were removed, throngs of Cubans crowded into the lushly landscaped gardens at the embassy, requesting asylum… . By mid-April, Carter issued a Presidential Memorandum allowing up to 3,500 refugees sanctuary in the U.S… . But the Carter Administration was taken by surprise when on April 21, refugees started arriving on Florida's shores—their numbers would eventually reach 125,000.

If you're a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology, or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors, we should help you do that here. Because if you succeed, you'll create American businesses and American jobs. You'll help us grow our economy. You'll help us strengthen our middle class.

# From N

From May to September 1980, boatloads of refugees from Cuba arrived in Miami, Florida. For political reasons, Fidel Castro had allowed them to leave freely from the port of Mariel, Cuba, during that brief period. Known as "the Mariel boat lift," this influx of about 125,000 refugees to Miami increased the city's Cuban population by  $20\%$  and its overall population by about  $7\%$ . The widespread unemployment of many of the refugees during the summer of 1980 led many people to expect that the wages of other workers in Miami would be held down by the Mariel immigrants.

Not surprisingly, the refugees were less skilled than the other workers in Miami, as is confirmed by looking at their wages: the immigrants initially earned about

4 Conclusions one-third less than other Cubans in Miami. What is surprising, however, is that this influx of low-skilled immigrants does not appear to have pulled down the wages of other less skilled workers in Miami.[2] The wages for low-skilled workers in Miami essentially followed national trends over this period, despite the large inflow of workers from Cuba. This finding seems to contradict the prediction of basic supply and demand theory—that a higher supply of workers should bid down their wage and that restricting immigration will raise the wages for local workers. The fact that wages in Miami did not respond to the inflow of Mariel refugees calls for an explanation, which is one goal of this chapter.

A similar outcome occurred in a more recent case of sudden migration, the emigration of Russian Jews to Israel after 1989, when the Soviet Union relaxed its restrictions on such departures. From late 1989 to 1996, some 670,000 Russian Jews immigrated to Israel, which increased the population in Israel by  $11\%$  and its workforce by  $14\%$ . This wave of immigration was especially notable because the Russian immigrants were more highly skilled than the existing Israeli population. But despite this large influx of immigrants, the relative wages of high-skilled workers in Israel actually rose during the 1990s. Careful studies of this episode can find little or no negative impact of the Russian immigrants on the wages of other high-skilled workers.[3]

These emigrations were of different types of workers—the Cuban workers were low-skilled and the Russian emigrants high-skilled—but they share the finding that large inflows of workers need not depress wages in the areas where they settle. In other cases of large-scale migration—such as occurred from Europe to America during the 1800s and 1900s—wages did indeed fall because of the inflow of immigrants. So the Mariel boat lift and Russian immigration to Israel should be seen as special: they are cases in which the economic principles of supply and demand do not at first glance work as we would expect them to.

In this chapter, we begin our study of the movement of labor across countries by explaining the case in which immigration leads to a fall in wages, as we normally expect. The model we use is the specific-factors model, the short-run model introduced in Chapter 3. That model allows labor to move between industries but keeps capital and land specific to each industry. To study migration, we allow labor to move between countries as well as industries, while still keeping capital and land specific to each industry.

Next, we use the long-run Heckscher-Ohlin model, from Chapter 4, in which capital and land can also move between industries. In the long run, an increase in labor will not lower the wage, as illustrated by the Mariel boat lift to Miami and the Russian immigration to Israel. This outcome occurs because industries have more time to respond to the inflow of workers by adjusting their outputs. It turns out that by adjusting industry output enough, the economy can absorb the new workers without changing the wage for existing workers. The explanation for this surprising outcome relies on the assumption that industries are able to sell their outputs on international markets.

To give a brief idea of how this long-run explanation will work, think about the highly skilled scientists and engineers emigrating from Russia to Israel. The only way to employ the large number of these workers at the going wages would be to increase the number of scientific and engineering projects in which Israeli companies are engaged. Where does the demand for these new projects come from? It is unlikely this demand would be generated in Israel alone, and more likely that it would come from Israeli exports to the rest of the world. We see then that the ability of Israel to export products making use of the highly skilled immigrants is essential to our explanation: with international demand, it is possible for the Russian immigrants to be fully employed in export activities without lowering wages in Israel. Likewise, with the influx of low-skilled Cuban immigrants to Miami, many of whom could work in the textile and apparel industry or in agriculture, it is the ability of Florida to export those products that allows the workers to be employed at the going wages.

The effect of immigration on wages can be quite different in the short run and in the long run. In this chapter we demonstrate that difference, and discuss government policies related to immigration. Policies to restrict or to allow immigration are an important part of government regulation in every country, including the United States. As President Obama began his second term as President in 2013, one of his goals was to achieve a reform of immigration policies. We discuss why reforms are needed in the United States and what they might achieve.

After studying what happens when labor moves across countries, we study the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI), the movement of capital across countries. FDI occurs when a company from one country owns a company in another country. We conclude the chapter by discussing the gains to the source and destination countries, and to the world, from the movement of labor or capital between countries.

# 1 Movement of Labor Between Countries: Migration

We begin with the examples of labor migration described by the Mariel boat lift and the Russian migration to Israel. We can think of each migration as a movement of labor from the Foreign country to the Home country. What is the impact of this movement of labor on wages paid at Home? To answer this question, we make use of our work in Chapter 3, in which we studied how the wages paid to labor and the rentals paid to capital and land are determined by the prices of the goods produced. The prices of goods themselves are determined by supply and demand in world markets. In the analysis that follows, we treat the prices of goods as fixed and ask how the Home wage and the rentals paid to capital and land change as labor moves between countries.

# Effects of Immigration in the Short Run: Specific-Factors Model

We begin our study of the effect of factor movements between countries by using the specific-factors model we learned in Chapter 3 to analyze the short run, when labor is mobile among Home industries, but land and capital are fixed. After that, we consider the long run, when all factors are mobile among industries at Home.

Determining the Wage Figure 5-1 shows a diagram that we used in Chapter 3 to determine the equilibrium wage paid to labor. The horizontal axis measures the total amount of labor in the economy  $\overline{L}$ , which consists of the labor used in manufacturing  $L_{M}$  and the amount used in agriculture  $L_{A}$ :

$$
L _ {M} + L _ {A} = \overline {{L}}
$$

Home Labor Market The Home wage is determined at point  $A$ , the intersection of the marginal product of labor curves  $P_M \cdot MPL_M$  and  $P_A \cdot MPL_A$  in manufacturing and agriculture, respectively. The amount of labor used in manufacturing is measured from left to right, starting at the origin  $0_M$ , and the amount of labor used in agriculture is measured from right to left, starting at the origin  $0_A$ . At point  $A$ ,  $0_M L$  units of labor are used in manufacturing and  $0_A L$  units of labor are used in agriculture.

In Figure 5-1, the amount of labor used in manufacturing  $L_{M}$  is measured from left  $(0_{M})$  to right, and the amount of labor used in agriculture  $L_{A}$  is measured from right  $(0_{A})$  to left.

The two curves in Figure 5-1 take the marginal product of labor in each sector and multiply it by the price  $(P_M$  or  $P_A)$  in that sector. The graph of  $P_M\cdot MPL_M$  is downward-sloping because as more labor is used in manufacturing, the marginal product of labor in that industry declines, and wages fall. The graph of  $P_A\cdot MPL_A$  for agriculture is upward-sloping because we are measuring the labor used in agriculture  $L_{A}$  from right to left in the diagram: as more labor is used in agriculture (moving from right to left), the marginal product of labor in agriculture falls, and wages fall.

The equilibrium wage is at point  $A$ , the intersection of the marginal product curves  $P_{M} \cdot MPL_{M}$  and  $P_{A} \cdot MPL_{A}$  in Figure 5-1. At this point,  $0_{M}L$  units of labor are used in manufacturing, and firms in that industry are willing to pay the wage  $W = P_{M} \cdot MPL_{M}$ . In addition,  $0_{A}L$  units of labor are used in agriculture, and farmers are willing to pay the wage  $W = P_{A} \cdot MPL_{A}$ . Because wages are equal in the two sectors, there is no reason for labor to move between them, and the Home labor market is in equilibrium.

In the Foreign country, a similar diagram applies. We do not draw this but assume that the equilibrium wage abroad  $W^{*}$  is less than  $W$  in Home. This assumption would apply to the Cuban refugees, for example, who moved to Miami and to the Russian emigrants who moved to Israel to earn higher wages as well as to enjoy more freedom. As a result of this difference in wages, workers from Foreign would want to immigrate to Home and the Home workforce would increase by an amount  $\Delta L$ , reflecting the number of immigrants.

Effect of Immigration on the Wage in Home The effects of immigration are shown in Figure 5-2. Because the number of workers at Home has grown by  $\Delta L$ , we expand the size of the horizontal axis from  $\overline{L}$  to  $\overline{L}^{\prime} = \overline{L} + \Delta L$ . The right-most point on the horizontal axis, which is the origin  $0_A$  for the agriculture industry, shifts to the

# FIGURE 5-2

# Increase in Home

Labor When the amount of labor at Home increases by the amount  $\Delta L$ , the origin for agriculture shifts to the right by that amount, from  $0_{A}$  to  $0_{A}^{\prime}$ . The marginal product of labor curve in agriculture also shifts right by the amount  $\Delta L$ . Equilibrium in the Home labor market is now at point  $B$ : wages have fallen to  $W^{\prime}$  and the amount of labor has increased in manufacturing (to  $0_{H}L^{\prime}$ ) and in agriculture (to  $0_{A}^{\prime}L^{\prime}$ ).

right by the amount  $\Delta L$ . As this origin moves rightward, it carries along with it the marginal product curve  $P_A \cdot MPL_A$  for the agriculture industry (because the marginal product of labor curve is graphed relative to its origin). That curve shifts to the right by exactly the amount  $\Delta L$ , the increase in the Home workforce. There is no shift in the marginal product curve  $P_M \cdot MPL_M$  for the manufacturing industry because the origin  $0_M$  for manufacturing has not changed. $^4$

The new equilibrium Home wage is at point  $B$ , the intersection of the marginal product curves. At the new equilibrium, the wage is lower. Notice that the extra workers  $\Delta L$  arriving at Home are shared between the agriculture and manufacturing industries: the number of workers employed in manufacturing is now  $0_{M}L'$ , which is higher than  $0_{M}L$ , and the number of workers employed in agriculture is  $0_{A}'L'$ , which is also higher than  $0_{A}L$ . Because both industries have more workers but fixed amounts of capital and land, the wage in both industries declines due to the diminishing marginal product of labor.

We see, then, that the specific-factors model predicts that an inflow of labor will lower wages in the country in which the workers are arriving. This prediction has been confirmed in numerous episodes of large-scale immigration, as described in the applications that follow.

# Immigration to the New World

Between 1870 and 1913, some 30 million Europeans left their homes in the "Old World" to immigrate to the "New World" of North and South America and Australia. The population of Argentina rose by  $60\%$  because of immigration, and Australia and Canada gained  $30\%$  more people. The population of the United States increased by  $17\%$  as a result of immigration (and it absorbed the largest number of people, more than 15 million). The migrants left the Old World for the opportunities present in the New and, most important, for the higher real wages. In Figure 5-3, we show an index of average real wages in European countries and in the New World (an average of the United States, Canada, and Australia). In 1870 real wages were nearly three times higher in the New World than in Europe—120 as compared with 40.

Real wages in both locations grew over time as capital accumulated and raised the marginal product of labor. But because of the large-scale immigration to the New World, wages grew more slowly there. By 1913, just before the onset of World War I, the wage index in the New World was at 160, so real wages had grown by  $(160 - 120) / 120 = 33\%$  over 43 years. In Europe, however, the wage index reached 75 by 1913, an increase of  $(75 - 40) / 40 = 88\%$  over 43 years. In 1870 real wages in the New World were three times as high as those in Europe, but by 1913 this wage gap was substantially reduced, and

FIGURE 5-3

Wages in Europe and the New World Large-scale migration from Europe to the New World in America and Australia closed the wage gap between the two locations. In 1870 wages in the New World were almost three times as high as wages in Europe, whereas in 1910 they were about twice as high. Migration also slowed the growth of wages in the New World relative to what they would have been without migration and allowed for slightly faster growth of wages in Europe.

wages in the New World were only about twice as high as those in Europe. Large-scale migration therefore contributed to a "convergence" of real wages across the continents.

In Figure 5-3, we also show estimates of what real wages would have been if migration had not occurred. Those estimates are obtained by calculating how the marginal product of labor would have grown with capital accumulation but without the immigration. Comparing the actual real wages with the no-migration estimates, we see that the growth of wages in the New World was slowed by immigration (workers arriving), while wages in Europe grew slightly faster because of emigration (workers leaving).

# Immigration to the United States and Europe Today

The largest amount of migration is no longer from Europe to the "New World." Instead, workers from developing countries immigrate to wealthier countries in the European Union and North America, when they can. In many cases, the immigration includes a mix of low-skilled workers and high-skilled workers. During the 1960s and 1970s, some European countries actively recruited guest workers, called gastrarbeiters in West Germany, to fill labor shortages in unskilled jobs. Many of these foreign workers have remained in Germany for years, some for generations, so they are no longer "guests" but long-term residents. At the end of 1994, about 2.1 million foreigners were employed in western Germany, with citizens of Turkey, the former Yugoslavia, Greece, and Italy representing the largest groups.

Today, the European Union has expanded to include many of the countries in Eastern Europe, and in principle there is free migration within the European Union. In practice, it can still be difficult for countries to absorb all the workers who want to enter, whether they come from inside or outside the Union. A recent example from Europe is the inflow of migrants from Northern Africa, especially from Tunisia and Libya. During 2011 and 2012, some 58,000 migrants escaped unrest in Africa and sailed on small boats to the island of Lampedusa in Italy. That inflow of migrants has created a situation not unlike the "Mariel boat lift" situation several decades ago in the United States, as discussed at the beginning of the chapter. The inflow has strained the ability of the European Union to maintain passport-free migration between countries. As described in Headlines: Call for Return of Border Controls in Europe, these migrants were not welcome to move freely from Italy to France, where some of them had families or friends.

Immigrants from Tunisia, Africa arrive in Lampedusa, Italy on March 27, 2011.

In the United States, there is a widespread perception among policy makers that the current immigration system is not working and needs to be fixed. A new immigration bill was debated in the U.S. Congress in 2013. As described in Headlines: The Economic Windfall of Immigration Reform, there are several issues that this bill needs to address, related to both illegal and legal immigration.

It is estimated that there are about 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States, many of them from Mexico. Gaining control over U.S. borders is one goal of immigration policy, but focusing on that goal alone obscures the fact that the majority of immigrants who enter the United States each year are legal.

# Call for Return of Border Controls in Europe

In 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president at the time, and Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister at the time, called for limits on passport-free travel among European Union countries in response to the flood of North African immigrants entering Italy through the island of Lampedusa.

Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi are expected to call on Tuesday for a partial reintroduction of national border controls across Europe, a move that would put the brakes on European integration and curb passport-free travel for more than 400 million people in 25 countries.

The French president and the Italian prime minister are meeting in Rome after weeks of tension between their two countries over how to cope with an influx of more than 25,000 immigrants fleeing revolutions in north Africa. The migrants, mostly Tunisian, reached the EU by way of Italian islands such as Lampedusa, but many hoped to get work in France where they have relatives and friends.

Earlier this month, Berlusconi's government outraged several EU governments, including France, by offering the migrants temporary residence permits which, in principle, allowed them to travel to other member states under the Schengen agreement. An Italian junior minister said on Sunday that Rome had so far issued some 8,000 permits and expected the number would rise to 11,000.

Launched in 1995, Schengen allows passport-free travel in most of the EU, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. But the documents issued by the Italian authorities are only valid if the holders can show they have the means to support themselves, and French police have rounded up or turned back an unknown number of migrants in recent days.

On 17 April, Paris blocked trains crossing the frontier at Ventimiglia in protest at the Italian initiative. "Rarely have the two countries seemed so far apart," said Le Monde in an editorial on Monday.

Yet, with both leaders under pressure from the far right, French and Italian officials appear to have agreed a common position on amending Schengen so that national border checks can be reintroduced in "special circumstances".

Persons seeking to legally enter the United States sometimes must wait a very long time, because under current U.S. law, migrants from any one foreign country cannot number more than  $7\%$  of the total legal immigrants into the United States each year. Giovanni Peri, the author of "The Economic Windfall of Immigration Reform" article, proposes that businesses should be allowed to compete for migrants who have the skills needed for the jobs that the businesses have to offer. Firms could, for example, compete by bidding for temporary work permits in auctions. After obtaining the work permits, the firms could then sell them to other firms. In this way, the permits would eventually be bought by the firms that valued them most highly, promoting efficiency in the flow of migrants.

Such an auction scheme could be used for seasonal agricultural workers, for example, some of whom legally enter the United States under the H-2A visa program. An

# The Economic Windfall of Immigration Reform

Writing during the U.S. debate over immigration reform in 2013, Professor Giovanni Peri discusses three principles that reform should follow. He argues that there are large gains from increasing the supply of highly-skilled immigrants to the United States, by allowing firms to bid for temporary work permits.

After months of acrimony, it now appears that immigration reform, and a comprehensive one at that, is within reach. While most of the debates have been about the immediate consequences of any change in policy, the goal should be to promote economic growth over the next 40 years.

Much of the reform debate has centered around granting legal status to undocumented immigrants, conditional upon payment of fees and back taxes. From an economic point of view, this will likely have only a modest impact, especially in the short run. Yet the problem of undocumented immigrants is likely to come back unless we find better ways to legally accommodate new immigrants. Much larger economic gains are achievable if we reorganize the immigration system to do that, following three fundamental principles.

The first is simplification. The current visa system is the accumulation of many disconnected provisions. Some rules, set in the past—such as the  $7\%$  limit on permanent permits to any nationality—are arbitrary and produce delays, bottlenecks and inefficiencies. A more rational approach would have the government set overall targets and simple rules for temporary and permanent working permits, deciding the balance between permits in "skilled" and "unskilled" jobs. But the government should not micromanage permits, rules and limits in specific occupations. Employers compete to hire immigrants, and they are best suited at selecting the individuals who will be the most productive in the jobs that are needed.

The second important principle is that the number of temporary work visas should respond to the demand for labor. Currently the limited number of these visas is set with no consideration for economic conditions. Their number is rarely revised. In periods of high demand, the economic incentives to bypass the limits and hire undocumented workers are large… . [W]e propose that temporary permits to hire immigrants should be made tradable and sold by the government in auctions to employers. Such a "cap and trade" system would ensure efficiency. The auction price of permits would signal the demand for immigrants and guide the upward and downward adjustment of the permit numbers over years.

The third principle governing immigration reform is that scientists, engineers and innovators are the main drivers of productivity and of economic growth… . I have found in a study published in January that foreign scientists and engineers brought into this country under the H1B visa program have contributed to  $10\% - 20\%$  of the yearly productivity growth in the U.S. during the period 1990-2010. This allowed the GDP per capita to be  $4\%$  higher than it would have been without them—that's an aggregate increase of output of 615 billion as of 2010.

auction could also expand the existing H-1B visa program for engineers, scientists, and other skilled workers needed in high-technology industries. The H-1B program was established during the Clinton administration to attract highly skilled immigrants to the United States, and it continues today. According to this article, the inflow of highly skilled immigrants on H-1B visas can explain  $10\%$  to  $20\%$  of the yearly productivity growth in the United States, as discussed later in the chapter.

The potential competition that immigrants create for U.S. workers with the same educational level is illustrated in Figure 5-4. On the vertical axis we show the share of immigrants (legal and illegal) as a percentage of the total workforce in the United States with that educational level. For example, from the first bar we see that immigrants account for  $40\%$  of the total number of workers in the United States that do not have a high-school education (the remaining  $60\%$  are U.S. born). Many of those

# Share of Foreign-Born Workers in U.S. Workforce,

2010 This figure shows the share of foreign-born workers in the U.S. workforce, categorized by educational level. For example, among workers with 0 to 11 years of education, about  $40\%$  were foreign-born. At the other end of the spectrum, the foreign-born make up  $16\%$  of workers with Master's and professional degrees, almost  $30\%$  of those with Ph.D.'s, and almost  $40\%$  of those with Ph.D.'s in science and engineering. In the middle educational levels (high school and college graduates), there are much smaller shares of foreign-born workers, ranging from  $10\%$  to  $15\%$ . On the horizontal axis, we show the share of U.S.-born workers in each educational group. Only about  $8\%$  to  $10\%$  of U.S.-born workers are categorized in each of the low-education and high-education groups; most U.S.-born workers are either high school graduates or college graduates.

immigrants without a high-school education are illegal, but we do not know the exact number. We know, however, that the share of high-school dropouts in the U.S.-born workforce is quite small: only  $8\%$  of workers born in the United States do not have a high-school education. That percentage is shown on the horizontal axis of Figure 5-4. So, even though illegal immigrants attract much attention in the U.S. debate over immigration, those immigrants with less than high-school education are competing with a small share of U.S.-born workers.

As we move to the next bars in Figure 5-4, the story changes. A large portion of U.S.-born workers— $82\%$  as shown on the horizontal axis—have completed high school education, may have started college, or graduated with an Associate's or Bachelor's degree. The shares of these educational groups that are composed of immigrants are quite small, ranging between  $10\%$  and  $15\%$  (the remainder being U.S.-born workers). So in these middle levels of education, immigrants are not numerous enough to create a significant amount of competition with U.S.-born workers for jobs.

At the other end of the spectrum,  $10\%$  of U.S.-born workers have Master's degrees or Ph.D.'s. Within this high-education group, foreign-born Master's-degree holders make up  $16\%$  of the U.S. workforce, and foreign-born Ph.D.'s make up nearly  $30\%$ , of the U.S. workforce. Furthermore, an even higher fraction of foreign-born immigrants, close to  $40\%$ , have Ph.D.'s in science and engineering fields (with slightly more than  $60\%$  being U.S. born). To summarize, Figure 5-4 shows that immigrants into the United States compete primarily with workers at the lowest and highest ends of the educational levels and much less with the majority of U.S.-born workers with mid-levels of education.

If we extend the specific-factors model to allow for several types of labor distinguished by educational level but continue to treat capital and land as fixed, then the greatest negative impact of immigration on wages would be for the lowestand highest-educated U.S. workers. That prediction is supported by estimates of the effect of immigration on U.S. wages: from 1990 to 2006, immigration led to a fall in wages of  $7.8\%$  for high school dropouts and  $4.7\%$  for college graduates. But the impact of immigration on the wages of the majority of U.S. workers (those with mid-levels of education) is much less: wages of high school graduates decreased by  $2.2\%$  from 1990 to 2006, and wages of individuals with less than four years of college decreased by less than  $1\%$ . The negative impact of immigration on wages is thus fairly modest for most workers and is offset when capital moves between industries, as discussed later in the chapter.

# Other Effects of Immigration in the Short Run

The United States and Europe have both welcomed foreign workers into specific industries, such as agriculture and the high-tech industry, even though these workers compete with domestic workers in those industries. This observation suggests that there must be benefits to the industries involved. We can measure the potential benefits by the payments to capital and land, which we refer to as "rentals." We saw in Chapter 3 that there are two ways to compute the rentals: either as the earnings left over in the industry after paying labor or as the marginal product of capital or land times the price of the good produced in each industry. Under either method, the owners of capital and land benefit from the reduction in wages due to immigration.

Rentals on Capital and Land Under the first method for computing the rentals, we take the revenue earned in either manufacturing or agriculture and subtract the payments to labor. If wages fall, then there is more left over as earnings of capital and land, so these rentals are higher. Under the second method for computing rentals, capital and land earn their marginal product in each industry times the price of the industry's good. As more labor is hired in each industry (because wages are lower), the marginal products of capital and land both increase. The increase in the marginal product occurs because each machine or acre of land has more workers available to it, and that machine or acre of land is therefore more productive. So under the second method, too, the marginal products of capital and land rise and so do their rentals.

From this line of reasoning, we should not be surprised that owners of capital and land often support more open borders, which provide them with foreign workers who can be employed in their industries. The restriction on immigration in a country should therefore be seen as a compromise between entrepreneurs and landowners who might welcome the foreign labor; local unions and workers who view migrants as a potential source of competition leading to lower wages; and the immigrant groups themselves, who if they are large enough (such as the Cuban population in Miami) might also have the ability to influence the political outcome on immigration policy.

Effect of Immigration on Industry Output One final effect of labor immigration is its effect on the output of the industries. In Figure 5-2, the increase in the labor force due to immigration led to more workers being employed in each of the industries: employment increased from  $0_{M}L$  to  $0_{M}L^{\prime}$  in manufacturing and from  $0_{A}L$  to

$0_A^\prime L^\prime$  in agriculture. With more workers and the same amount of capital or land, the output of both industries rises. This outcome is shown in Figure 5-5—immigration leads to an outward shift in the production possibilities frontier (PPF). With constant prices of goods (as we assumed earlier, because prices are determined by world supply and demand), the output of the industries rises from point  $A$  to point  $B$ .

Although it may seem obvious that having more labor in an economy will increase the output of both industries, it turns out that this result depends on the short-run nature of the specific-factors model, when capital and land in each industry are fixed. If instead these resources can move between the industries, as would occur in the long run, then the output of one industry will increase but that of the other industry will decline, as we explain in the next section.

# Effects of Immigration in the Long Run

We turn now to the long run, in which all factors are free to move between industries. Because it is complicated to analyze a model with three factors of production—capital, land, and labor—all of which are fully mobile between industries, we will ignore land and assume that only labor and capital are used to produce two goods: computers and shoes. The long-run model is just like the Heckscher-Ohlin model studied in the previous chapter except that we now allow labor to move between countries. (Later in the chapter, we allow capital to move between the countries.)

The amount of capital used in computers is  $K_{C}$ , and the amount of capital used in shoe production is  $K_{S}$ . These quantities add up to the total capital available in the economy:  $K_{C} + K_{S} = \overline{K}$ . Because capital is fully mobile between the two sectors in the

Shift in Home Production Possibilities Curve With the increase in labor at Home from immigration, the production possibilities frontier shifts outward and the output of both industries increases, from point  $A$  to point  $B$ . Output in both industries increases because of the short-run nature of the specific-factors model; in the short run, land and capital do not move between the industries, and the extra labor in the economy is shared between both industries.

long run, it must earn the same rental  $R$  in each. The amount of labor used to manufacture computers is  $L_{C}$ , and the labor used in shoe production is  $L_{S}$ . These amounts add up to the total labor in the economy,  $L_{C} + L_{S} = \overline{L}$ , and all labor earns the same wage of  $W$  in both sectors.

In our analysis, we make the realistic assumption that more labor per machine is used in shoe production than in computer production. That assumption means that shoe production is labor-intensive compared with computer production, so the labor-capital ratio in shoes is higher than it is in computers:  $L_{S} / K_{S} > L_{C} / K_{C}$ . Computer production, then, is capital-intensive compared with shoes, and the capital-labor ratio is higher in computers:  $K_{C} / L_{C} > K_{S} / L_{S}$ .

The PPF for an economy producing shoes and computers is shown in Figure 5-6. Given the prices of both goods (determined by supply and demand in world markets), the equilibrium outputs are shown at point  $A$ , at the tangency of the PPF and world relative price line. Our goal in this section is to see how the equilibrium is affected by having an inflow of labor into Home as a result of immigration.

Box Diagram To analyze the effect of immigration, it is useful to develop a new diagram to keep track of the amount of labor and capital used in each industry. Shown as a "box diagram" in Figure 5-7, the length of the top and bottom horizontal axes is the total amount of labor  $\overline{L}$  at Home, and the length of the right and left vertical axes is the total amount of capital  $\overline{K}$  at Home. A point like point  $A$  in the diagram indicates that  $0_{S}L$  units of labor and  $0_{S}K$  units of capital are used in shoes, while  $0_{C}L$  units of labor and  $0_{C}K$  units of capital are used in computers. Another way to express this is that the line  $0_{S}A$  shows the amount of labor and capital used in shoes and the line  $0_{CA}$  shows the amount of labor and capital used in computers.

Production Possibilities Frontier Shown here is the production possibilities frontier (PPF) between two manufactured goods, computers and shoes, with initial equilibrium at point  $A$ . Domestic production takes place at point  $A$ , which is the point of tangency between the world price line and the PPF.

FIGURE 5-7

# Allocation of Labor and Capital in a Box

Diagram The top and bottom axes of the box diagram measure the amount of labor,  $\overline{L}$ , in the economy, and the side axes measure the amount of capital,  $\overline{K}$ . At point  $A$ ,  $0_{S}L$  units of labor and  $0_{S}K$  units of capital are used in shoe production, and  $0_{C}L$  units of labor and  $O_{C}K$  units of capital are used in computers. The  $K / L$  ratios in the two industries are measured by the slopes of  $0_{S}A$  and  $0_{C}A$ , respectively.

Notice that the line  $0_{S}A$  for shoes is flatter than the line  $0_{CA}$  for computers. We can calculate the slopes of these lines by dividing the vertical distance by the horizontal distance (the rise over the run). The slope of  $0_{S}A$  is  $0_{S}K / 0_{S}L$ , the capital-labor ratio used in the shoe industry. Likewise, the slope of  $0_{CA}$  is  $0_{C}K / 0_{C}L$ , the capital-labor ratio for computers. The line  $0_{S}A$  is flatter than  $0_{CA}$ , so the capital-labor ratio in the shoe industry is less than that in computers; that is, there are fewer units of capital per worker in the shoe industry. This is precisely the assumption that we made earlier. It is a realistic assumption given that the manufacture of computer components such as semiconductors requires highly precise and expensive equipment, which is operated by a small number of workers. Shoe production, on the other hand, requires more workers and a smaller amount of capital.

Determination of the Real Wage and Real Rental In addition to determining the amount of labor and capital used in each industry in the long run, we also need to determine the wage and rental in the economy. To do so, we use the logic introduced in Chapter 3: the wage and rental are determined by the marginal products of labor and capital, which are in turn determined by the capital-labor ratio in either industry. If there is a higher capital-labor ratio (i.e., if there are more machines per worker), then by the law of diminishing returns, the marginal product of capital and the real rental must be lower. Having more machines per worker means that the marginal product of labor (and hence the real wage) is higher because each worker is more productive. On the other hand, if there is a higher labor-capital ratio (more workers per machine), then the marginal product of labor must be lower because of diminishing returns, and hence the real wage is lower, too. In addition, having more workers per machine means that the marginal product of capital and the real rental are both higher.

The important point to remember is that each amount of labor and capital used in Figure 5-7 along line  $0_{S}A$  corresponds to a particular capital-labor ratio for shoe manufacture and therefore a particular real wage and real rental. We now consider how the labor and capital used in each industry will change due to immigration at Home. Although the total amount of labor and capital used in each industry changes, we will show that the capital-labor ratios are unaffected by immigration, which means that the immigrants can be absorbed with no change at all in the real wage and real rental.

Increase in the Amount of Home Labor Suppose that because of immigration, the amount of labor at Home increases from  $\overline{L}$  to  $\overline{L}^{\prime} = \overline{L} +\Delta L$ . This increase expands the labor axes in the box diagram, as shown in Figure 5-8. Rather than allocating  $\overline{L}$  labor and  $\overline{K}$  capital between the two industries, we must now allocate  $\overline{L}^{\prime}$  labor and

FIGURE 5-8

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/fccdec2272c9b2c3a0fb38e79d8690b059b9bdf29dc5acdb761ebc0ab4b74ed3.jpg)

Increase in Home Labor With an increase in Home labor from  $\overline{L}$  to  $\overline{L} +\Delta L$  the origin for the shoe industry shifts from  $0_{S}$  to  $0^{\prime}_{S}$ . At point  $B,0^{\prime}_{S}L^{\prime}$  units of labor and  $0^{\prime}_{S}K^{\prime}$  units of capital are used in shoes, whereas  $0_{C}L^{\prime}$  units of labor and  $0_{C}K^{\prime}$  units of capital are used in computers. In the long run, industry outputs adjust so that the capital-labor ratios in each industry at point  $B$  (the slopes of  $0_{S}^{\prime}B$  and  $0_{C}B$ ) are unchanged from the initial equilibrium at point  $A$  (the slopes of  $0_{S}A$  and  $0_{C}A$ ). To achieve this outcome, all new labor resulting from immigration is allocated to the shoe industry, and capital and additional labor are transferred from computers to shoes, keeping the capital-labor ratio in both industries unchanged.

$\overline{K}$  capital. The question is how much labor and capital will be used in each industry so that the total amount of both factors is fully employed?

You might think that the only way to employ the extra labor is to allocate more of it to both industries (as occurred in the short-run specific-factors model). This outcome would tend to lower the marginal product of labor in both industries and therefore lower the wage. But it turns out that such an outcome will not occur in the long-run model because when capital is also able to move between the industries, industry outputs will adjust to keep the capital-labor ratios in each industry constant. Instead of allocating the extra labor to both industries, all the extra labor  $(\Delta L)$  will be allocated to shoes, the labor-intensive industry. Moreover, along with that extra labor, some capital is withdrawn from computers and allocated to shoes. To maintain the capital-labor ratio in the computer industry, some labor will also leave the computer industry, along with the capital, and go to the shoe industry. Because all the new workers in the shoe industry (immigrants plus former computer workers) have the same amount of capital to work with as the shoe workers prior to immigration, the capital-labor ratio in the shoe industry stays the same. In this way, the capital-labor ratio in each industry is unchanged and the additional labor in the economy is fully employed.

This outcome is illustrated in Figure 5-8, where the initial equilibrium is at point  $A$ . With the inflow of labor due to immigration, the labor axis expands from  $\overline{L}$  to  $\overline{L} + \Delta L$ , from  $0_S$  to  $0'_S$  and the origin for the shoe industry shifts from  $0_S$  to  $0'_S$ . Consider point  $B$  as a possible new equilibrium. At this point,  $0'_S L'$  units of labor and  $0'_S K'$  units of capital are used in shoes, while  $0_C L'$  units of labor and  $0_C K'$  units of capital are used in computers. Notice that the lines  $0_S A$  and  $0'_S B$  are parallel and have the same slope, and similarly, the lines  $0_C A$  and  $0_C B$  have the same slope. The extra labor has been employed by expanding the amount of labor and capital used in shoes (the line  $0'_S B$  is longer than  $0_S A$ ) and contracting the amount of labor and capital used in computers (the line  $0_C B$  is smaller than  $0_C A$ ). That the lines have the same slope means that the capital-labor ratio used in each industry is exactly the same before and after the inflow of labor.

What has happened to the wage and rentals in the economy? Because the capital-labor ratios are unchanged in both industries, the marginal products of labor and capital are also unchanged. Therefore, the wage and rental do not change at all because of the immigration of labor! This result is very different from what happens in the short-run specific-factors model, which showed that immigration depressed the wage and raised the rental on capital and land. In the long-run model, when capital can move between industries, an inflow of labor has no impact on the wage and rental. Instead, the extra labor is employed in shoes, by combining it with capital and additional labor that has shifted out of computers. In that way, the capital-labor ratios in both industries are unchanged, as are the wage and rental.

Effect of Immigration on Industry Outputs What is the effect of immigration on the output of each industry? We have already seen from Figure 5-8 that more labor and capital are used in the labor-intensive industry (shoes), whereas less labor and capital are used in the capital-intensive industry (computers). Because the factors of production both increase or both decrease, it follows that the output of shoes expands and the output of computers contracts.

This outcome is shown in Figure 5-9, which shows the outward shift of the PPF due to the increase in the labor endowment at Home. Given the prices of computers and shoes, the initial equilibrium was at point  $A$ . At this point, the slope of the PPF equals the relative price of computers, as shown by the slope of the line tangent to the

# The Long-Run Effect on Industry Outputs of an Increase in Home

Labor With an increase in the amount of labor at Home, the PPF shifts outward. The output of shoes increases, while the output of computers declines as the equilibrium moves from point  $A$  to  $B$ . The prices of goods have not changed, so the slopes of the PPFs at points  $A$  and  $B$  (i.e., the relative price of computers) are equal.

PPF. With unchanged prices for the goods, and more labor in the economy, the equilibrium moves to point  $B$ , with greater output of shoes but reduced output of computers. Notice that the slope of the PPFs at points  $A$  and  $B$  is identical because the relative price of computers is unchanged. As suggested by the diagram, the expansion in the amount of labor leads to an uneven outward shift of the PPF—it shifts out more in the direction of shoes (the labor-intensive industry) than in the direction of computers. This asymmetric shift illustrates that the new labor is employed in shoes and that this additional labor pulls capital and additional labor out of computers in the long run, to establish the new equilibrium at point  $B$ . The finding that an increase in labor will expand one industry but contract the other holds only in the long run; in the short run, as we saw in Figure 5-5, both industries will expand. This finding, called the Rybczynski theorem, shows how much the long-run model differs from the short-run model. The long-run result is named after the economist T. N. Rybczynski, who first discovered it.

# Rybczynski Theorem

The formal statement of the Rybczynski theorem is as follows: in the Heckscher-Ohlin model with two goods and two factors, an increase in the amount of a factor found in an economy will increase the output of the industry using that factor intensively and decrease the output of the other industry.

We have proved the Rybczynski theorem for the case of immigration, in which labor in the economy grows. As we find later in the chapter, the same theorem holds when capital in the economy grows: in this case, the industry using capital intensively expands and the other industry contracts.[8]

Effect of Immigration on Factor Prices The Rybczynski theorem, which applies to the long-run Heckscher-Ohlin model with two goods and two factors of production, states that an increase in labor will expand output in one industry but contract output in the other industry. Notice that the change in outputs in the Rybczynski theorem goes hand in hand with the previous finding that the wage and rental will not change due to an increase in labor (or capital). The reason that factor prices do not need to change is that the economy can absorb the extra amount of a factor by increasing the output of the industry using that factor intensively and reducing the output of the other industry. The finding that factor prices do not change is sometimes called the factor price insensitivity result.

# Factor Price Insensitivity Theorem

The factor price insensitivity theorem states that: in the Heckscher-Ohlin model with two goods and two factors, an increase in the amount of a factor found in an economy can be absorbed by changing the outputs of the industries, without any change in the factor prices.

The applications that follow offer evidence of changes in output that absorb new additions to the labor force, as predicted by the Rybczynski theorem, without requiring large changes in factor prices, as predicted by the factor price insensitivity result.

# The Effects of the Mariel Boat Lift on Industry Output in Miami

Now that we have a better understanding of long-run adjustments due to changes in factor endowments, let us return to the case of the Mariel boat lift to Miami in 1980. We know that the Cuban refugees were less skilled than the average labor force in Miami. According to the Rybczynski theorem, then, we expect some unskilled-labor-intensive industry, such as footwear or apparel, to expand. In addition, we expect that some skill-intensive industry, such as the high-tech industry, will contract. Figure 5-10 shows how this prediction lines up with the evidence from Miami and some comparison cities.

Panel (a) of Figure 5-10 shows real value-added in the apparel industry for Miami and for an average of comparison cities. Real value-added measures the payments to labor and capital in an industry corrected for inflation. Thus, real value-added is a way to measure the output of the industry. We divide output by the population of the city to obtain real value-added per capita, which measures the output of the industry adjusted for the city size.

Panel (a) shows that the apparel industry was declining in Miami and the comparison cities before 1980. After the boat lift, the industry continued to decline but at a slower rate in Miami; the trend of output per capita for Miami has a smaller slope (and hence a smaller rate of decline in output) than that of the trend for comparison cities from 1980 onward. Notice that there is an increase in industry output in Miami from 1983 to 1984 (which may be due to new data collected that year), but even when averaging this out as the trend lines do, the industry decline in Miami is slightly

Industry Value-Added in Miami Shown here are real value-added in the apparel industry and in high-skilled industries (measured relative to the city population), for Miami and an average of comparison cities. In panel (a), with the inflow of refugees from Cuba in 1980, real value-added in the apparel industry in Miami rose from 1983 to 1984, and the trend decline of this industry in Miami was slower (i.e., value-added did not fal as fast) after 1980 than in the comparison cities. In panel (b), real value-added in Miami in high-skilled industries fell faster after 1980 than in the comparison cities. Both these findings are consistent with the Rybczynski theorem.

slower than in the comparison cities after 1980. This graph provides some evidence of the Rybczynski theorem at work: the reduction in the apparel industry in Miami was slower than it would have been without the inflow of immigrants.

What about the second prediction of the Rybczynski theorem: Did the output of any other industry in Miami fall because of the immigration? Panel (b) of Figure 5-10 shows that the output of a group of skill-intensive industries (including motor vehicles, electronic equipment, and aircraft) fell more rapidly in Miami after 1980. These data may also provide some evidence in favor of the Rybczynski theorem. However, it also happened that with the influx of refugees, there was a flight of homeowners away from Miami, and some of these were probably high-skilled workers. So the decline in the group of skill-intensive industries, shown in panel (b), could instead be due to this population decline. The change in industry outputs in Miami provides some evidence in favor of the Rybczynski theorem. Do these changes in industry outputs in Miami also provide an adequate explanation for why wages of unskilled workers did not decline, or is there some other explanation? An alternative explanation for the finding that wages did not change comes from comparing the use of computers in Miami with national trends. Beginning in the early 1980s, computers became increasingly used in the workplace. The adoption of computers is called a "skill-biased technological change." That is, computers led to an increase in the demand for high-skilled workers and reduced the hiring of low-skilled workers. This trend occurred across the United States and in other countries.

In Miami, however, computers were adopted somewhat more slowly than in cities with similar industry mix and ethnic populations. One explanation for this finding is that firms in many industries, not just apparel, employed the Mariel refugees and other low-skilled workers rather than switching to computer technologies. Evidence to support this finding is that the Mariel refugees were, in fact, employed in many industries. Only about  $20\%$  worked in manufacturing (5\% in apparel), and the remainder worked in service industries. The idea that the firms may have slowed the adoption of new technologies to employ the Mariel emigrants is hard to prove conclusively, however. We suggest it here as an alternative to the Rybczynski theorem to explain how the refugees could be absorbed across many industries rather than just in the industries using unskilled labor, such as apparel.

# Immigration and U.S. Wages, 1990-2006

In 1980, the year of the Mariel boat lift, the percentage of foreign-born people in the U.S. population was  $6.2\%$ . The percentage grew to  $9.1\%$  in 1990 and then to  $13.0\%$  in 2005, so there was slightly more than a doubling of foreign-born people in 25 years.[10] That period saw the greatest recent increase in foreign-born people in the United States, and by 2010 the percentage had grown only slightly more, to  $13.5\%$ . How did the wave of immigration prior to 2006 affect U.S. wages?

Part A of Table 5-1 reports the estimated impact of the immigration from 1990 to 2006 on the wages of various workers, distinguished by their educational level. The first row in part A summarizes the estimates from the specific-factors model, when capital and land are kept fixed within all industries. As we discussed in an earlier application, the greatest negative impact of immigration is on native-born workers with less than 12 years of education, followed by college graduates, and then followed by high school graduates and those with some college. Overall, the average impact of immigration on U.S. wages over the period of 1990-2006 was  $-3.0\%$ . That is, wages fell by  $3.0\%$ , consistent with the specific-factors model.

# TABLE 5-1

Immigration and Wages in the United States This table shows the estimated effect of immigration on the wages of workers, depending on their educational level, from 1990-2006. Short-run estimates hold capital and land fixed, while long-run estimates allow capital to adjust so that the capital/labor ratio and real rental are constant in the economy. Part A shows the impact of immigration assuming that U.S.-born and foreign-born workers are perfect substitutes. Immigration has the greatest impact on workers with very low or high levels of education and only a small impact on those workers with middle levels of education (12 to 15 years). The impact is even smaller in the long run, when capital adjusts to keep the real rental on capital fixed. Part B shows long-run estimates when U.S.-born and foreign-born workers in the U.S. are imperfect substitutes. In this case, immigrants compete especially strongly with other foreign-born workers by lowering their wages, and can potentially complement the activities of U.S.-born workers.

A different story emerges, however, if instead of keeping capital fixed, we hold constant the capital-labor ratio in the economy and the real rental on capital. Under this approach, we allow capital to grow to accommodate the inflow of immigrants, so that there is no change in the real rental. This approach is similar to the long-run model we have discussed, except that we now distinguish several types of labor by their education levels. In the second row of part A, we see that total U.S. immigration had a negative impact on workers with the lowest and highest levels of education and a positive impact on the other workers (due to the growth in capital). With these new assumptions, we see that the average U.S. wage rose by  $0.1\%$  because of immigration (combined with capital growth), rather than falling by  $3.0\%$ .

The finding that the average U.S. wage is nearly constant in the long run (rising by just  $0.1\%$ ) is similar to our long-run model in which wages do not change because of immigration. However, the finding that some workers gain (wages rise for the middle education levels) and others lose (wages fall for the lowest and the highest education levels) is different from our long-run model. There are two reasons for this outcome. First, as we already noted, Table 5-1 categorizes workers by different education levels. Even when the overall capital-labor ratio is fixed, and the real rental on capital is fixed, it is still possible for the wages of workers with certain education levels to change. Second, we can refer back to the U-shaped pattern of immigration shown in

Figure 5-4, where the fraction of immigrants in the U.S. workforce is largest for the lowest and highest education levels. It is not surprising, then, that these two groups face the greatest loss in wages due to an inflow of immigrants.

We can dig a little deeper to better understand the long-run wage changes in part A. In part A, we assumed that U.S.-born workers and foreign-born workers in each education level are perfect substitutes, that is, they do the same types of jobs and have the same abilities. In reality, evidence shows that U.S. workers and immigrants often end up doing different types of jobs, even when they have similar education. In part B of Table 5-1, we build in this realistic feature by treating U.S.-born workers and foreign-born workers in each education level as imperfect substitutes. Just as the prices of goods that are imperfect substitutes (for example, different types of cell phones) can differ, the wages of U.S.-born and foreign-born workers with the same education can also differ. This modification to our assumptions leads to a substantial change in the results.

In part B of Table 5-1, we find that immigration now raises the wages of all U.S.-born workers in the long run, by  $0.6\%$  on average. That slight rise occurs because the U.S-born and foreign-born workers are doing different jobs that can complement one another. For example, on a construction site, an immigrant worker with limited language skills can focus on physical tasks, while a U.S. worker can focus on tasks involving personal interaction. Part B shows another interesting outcome: the 1990–2006 immigration had the greatest impact on the wages of all other foreign-born workers, whose wages fell by an average of  $6.4\%$  in the long run. When we allow for imperfect substitution between U.S.-born and foreign-born workers, immigrants compete especially strongly with other foreign-born workers, and can potentially complement the activities of U.S.-born workers. Contrary to popular belief, immigrants don't necessarily lower the wages for U.S. workers with similar educational backgrounds. Instead, immigrants can raise wages for U.S. workers if the two groups are doing jobs that are complementary.

# 2 Movement of Capital Between Countries:

# Foreign Direct Investment

To continue our examination of what happens to wages and rentals when factors can move across borders, we turn now to look at how capital can move from one country to another through foreign direct investment (FDI), which occurs when a firm from one country owns a company in another country. How much does the company have to own for foreign direct investment to occur? Definitions vary, but the Department of Commerce in the United States uses  $10\%$ : if a foreign company acquires  $10\%$  or more of a U.S. firm, then that is counted as an FDI inflow to the United States, and if a U.S. company acquires  $10\%$  or more of a foreign firm, then that is counted as an FDI outflow from the United States.

When a company builds a plant in a foreign country, it is sometimes called "greenfield FDI" (because we imagine the site for the plant starting with grass on it). When a firm buys an existing foreign plant, it is called "acquisition FDI" (or sometimes "brownfield FDI"). Having capital move from high-wage to low-wage countries to earn a higher rental is the traditional view of FDI, and the viewpoint we take in this chapter.[11]

# Greenfield Investment

Our focus in this section will be on greenfield investment; that is, the building of new plants abroad. We model FDI as a movement of capital between countries, just as we modeled the movement of labor between countries. The key question we ask is: How does the movement of capital into a country affect the earnings of labor and capital there? This question is similar to the one we asked for immigration, so the earlier graphs that we developed can be modified to address FDI.

# FDI in the Short Run: Specific-Factors Model

We begin by modeling FDI in the short run, using the specific-factors model. In that model, the manufacturing industry uses capital and labor and the agriculture industry uses land and labor, so as capital flows into the economy, it will be used in manufacturing. The additional capital will raise the marginal product of labor in manufacturing because workers there have more machines with which to work. Therefore, as capital flows into the economy, it will shift out the curve  $P_{M} \cdot MPL_{M}$  for the manufacturing industry as shown in panel (a) of Figure 5-11.

Effect of FDI on the Wage As a result of this shift, the equilibrium wage increases, from  $W$  to  $W'$ . More workers are drawn into the manufacturing industry, and the labor used there increases from  $0_{M}L$  to  $0_{M}L'$ . Because these workers are pulled out of agriculture, the labor used there shrinks from  $0_{A}L$  to  $0_{A}L'$  (measuring from right to left).

(a) Effect on Labor Allocation and Wage

(b) Effect on Industry Outputs

# Increase in the Capital Stock in the Short Run In panel (a), an inflow of capital into the manufacturing sector

shifts out the marginal product of labor curve in that sector. The equilibrium in the labor market moves from point  $A$  to  $B$ , and the

wage increases from  $W$  to  $W^{\prime}$ . Labor used in the manufacturing industry increases from  $0_{M}L$  to  $0_{M}L^{\prime}$ . These workers are pulled out

of agriculture, so the labor used there shrinks from  $0_{A}L$  to  $0_{A}L^{\prime}$ .

In panel (b), with the inflow of capital into manufacturing, and the extra labor used in that sector, the output of manufacturing increases. Because labor has been drawn out of agriculture, the output of that sector falls. These changes in outputs are shown by the outward shift of the PPF (due to the increase in capital) and the movement from point A to point  $B$ .

Effect of FDI on the Industry Outputs It is easy to determine the effect of an inflow of FDI on industry outputs. Because workers are pulled out of agriculture, and there is no change in the amount of land used there, output of the agriculture industry must fall. With an increase in the number of workers used in manufacturing and an increase in capital used there, the output of the manufacturing industry must rise. These changes in output are shown in panel (b) of Figure 5-11 by the outward shift of the production possibilities frontier. At constant prices for goods (i.e., the relative price lines have the same slope before and after the increase in capital), the equilibrium outputs shift from point  $A$  to point  $B$ , with more manufacturing output and less agricultural output.

Effect of FDI on the Rentals Finally, we can determine the impact of the inflow of capital on the rental earned by capital and the rental earned by land. It is easiest to start with the agriculture industry. Because fewer workers are employed there, each acre of land cannot be cultivated as intensively as before, and the marginal product of land must fall. One way to measure the rental on land  $T$  is by the value of its marginal product,  $R_{T} = P_{A} \cdot MPT_{A}$ . With the fall in the marginal product of land  $(MPT_{A})$ , and no change in the price of agricultural goods, the rental on land falls.

Now let us consider manufacturing, which uses more capital and more labor than before. One way to measure the rental on capital is by the value of the marginal product of capital, or  $R_{K} = P_{M} \cdot MPK_{M}$ . Using this method, however, it is difficult to determine how the rental on capital changes. As capital flows into manufacturing, the marginal product of capital falls because of diminishing returns. That effect reduces the rental on capital. But as labor is drawn into manufacturing, the marginal product of capital tends to rise. So we do not know at first glance how the rental on capital changes overall.

Fortunately, we can resolve this difficulty by using another method to measure the rental on capital. We take the revenue earned in manufacturing and subtract the payments to labor. If wages are higher, and everything else is the same, then there must be a reduced amount of funds left over as earnings of capital, so the rental is lower.

Let us apply this line of reasoning more carefully to see how the inflow of FDI affects the rental on capital. In Figure 5-12, we begin at point  $A$  and then assume the capital stock expands because of FDI. Suppose we hold the wage constant, and let the labor used in manufacturing expand up to point  $C$ . Because the wage is the same at points  $A$  and  $C$ , the marginal product of labor in manufacturing must also be the same (since the wage is  $W = P_{M} \cdot MPL_{M}$ ). The only way that the marginal product of labor can remain constant is for each worker to have the same amount of capital to work with as he or she had before the capital inflow. In other words, the capital-labor ratio in manufacturing  $L_{M} / K_{M}$  must be the same at points  $A$  and  $C$ : the expansion of capital in manufacturing is just matched by a proportional expansion of labor into manufacturing. But if the capital-labor ratio in manufacturing is identical at points  $A$  and  $C$ , then the marginal product of capital must also be equal at these two points (because each machine has the same number of people working on it). Therefore, the rental on capital,  $R_{K} = P_{M} \cdot MPK_{M}$ , is also equal at points  $A$  and  $C$ .

Now let's see what happens as the manufacturing wage increases while holding constant the amount of capital used in that sector. The increase in the wage will move us up the curve  $P_{M} \cdot MPL_{M}'$  from point  $C$  to point  $B$ . As the wage rises, less labor is used in manufacturing. With less labor used on each machine in manufacturing, the marginal product of capital and the rental on capital must fall. This result confirms

# FIGURE 5-12

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/a2df88c1bae20aa75a9518f526a59ce1ec43032100bfc345390012c532354f5b.jpg)

The Effect of an Increase in Capital Stock on the Rental on Capital By carefully tracing through how the capital-labor ratio in manufacturing is affected by the movement from  $A$  to  $C$  (where wages and hence the capital-labor ratio do not change), and then the movement from  $C$  to  $B$  (where wages and the capital-labor ratio both increase), we conclude that the rental on capital is lower at point  $B$  than at point  $A$ . Therefore, the rental on capital declines when the capital stock increases through FDI.

our earlier reasoning: when wages are higher and the amount of capital used in manufacturing is the same, then the earnings of capital (i.e., its rental) must be lower. Because the rental on capital is the same at points  $A$  and  $C$  but is lower at point  $B$  than  $C$ , the overall effect of the FDI inflow is to reduce the rental on capital. We learned previously that the FDI inflow also reduces the rental on land, so both rentals fall.

# FDI in the Long Run

The results of FDI in the long run, when capital and labor can move between industries, differ from those we saw in the short-run specific-factors model. To model FDI in the long run, we assume again that there are two industries—computers and shoes—both of which use two factors of production: labor and capital. Computers are capital-intensive as compared with shoes, meaning that  $K_{C} / L_{C}$  exceeds  $K_{S} / L_{S}$ .

In panel (a) of Figure 5-13, we show the initial allocation of labor and capital between the two industries at point  $A$ . The labor and capital used in the shoe industry are  $0_{S}L$  and  $0_{S}K$ , so this combination is measured by the line  $0_{S}A$ . The labor and capital used in computers are  $0_{C}L$  and  $0_{C}K$ , so this combination is measured by the line  $0_{C}A$ . That amount of labor and capital used in each industry produces the output of shoes and computers shown by point  $A$  on the PPF in panel (b).

Effect of FDI on Outputs and Factor Prices An inflow of FDI causes the amount of capital in the economy to increase. That increase expands the right and left sides of the box in panel (a) of Figure 5-13 and shifts the origin up to  $0_{C}^{\prime}$ . The new allocation of factors between the industries is shown at point  $B$ . Now the labor and capital used in the shoe industry are measured by  $0_{S}B$ , which is shorter than the line  $0_{S}A$ . Therefore, less labor and less capital are used in the production of footwear, and shoe

Similar to the box diagram for immigration (Figure 5-8), the  $K/L$  ratios remain unchanged by allocating the

(b) Effect on Industry Outputs

Output of shoes,  $Q_{S}$ new capital, as well as additional capital and labor from shoes, to computers. In panel (b), with the increase in the amount of capital at Home from increased FDI, the PPF shifts outward. The output of computers increases while the output of shoes declines as the equilibrium moves from point  $A$  to  $B$ . Because the prices of goods have not changed, the slopes of the PPFs at points  $A$  and  $B$  are equal.

output falls. The labor and capital used in computers are measured by  $0_{C}^{\prime}B$ , which is longer than the line  $0_{C}A$ . Therefore, more labor and more capital are used in computers, and the output of that industry rises.

The change in outputs of shoes and computers is shown by the shift from point  $A$  to point  $B$  in panel (b) of Figure 5-13. In accordance with the Rybczynski theorem, the increase in capital through FDI has increased the output of the capital-intensive industry (computers) and reduced the output of the labor-intensive industry (shoes). Furthermore, this change in outputs is achieved with no change in the capital-labor ratios in either industry: the lines  $0_{C}^{\prime}B$  and  $0_{S}B$  have the same slopes as  $0_{C}A$  and  $0_{S}A$ , respectively.

Because the capital-labor ratios are unchanged in the two industries, the wage and the rental on capital are also unchanged. Each person has the same amount of capital to work with in his or her industry, and each machine has the same number of workers. The marginal products of labor and capital are unchanged in the two industries, as are the factor prices. This outcome is basically the same as that for immigration in the long run: in the long-run model, an inflow of either factor of production will leave factor prices unchanged.

When discussing immigration, we found cases in which wages were reduced (the short-run prediction) and other cases in which wages have been constant (the long-run prediction). What about for foreign direct investment? Does it tend to lower rentals or leave them unchanged? There are fewer studies of this question, but we next consider an important application for Singapore.

# APPLICATION

# The Effect of FDI on Rentals and Wages in Singapore

For many years, Singapore has encouraged foreign firms to establish subsidiaries within its borders, especially in the electronics industry. For example, many hard disks are manufactured in Singapore by foreign companies. In 2005 Singapore had the fourth largest amount of FDI in the world (measured by stock of foreign capital found there), following China, Mexico, and Brazil, even though it is much smaller than those economies.[12] As capital in Singapore has grown, what has happened to the rental and to the wage?

One way to answer this question is to estimate the marginal product of capital in Singapore, using a production function that applies to the entire economy. The overall capital-labor ratio in Singapore has grown by about  $5\%$  per year from 1970 to 1990. Because of diminishing returns, it follows that the marginal product of capital (equal to the real rental) has fallen, by an average of  $3.4\%$  per year as shown in part A of Table 5-2. At the same time, each worker has more capital to work with, so the marginal product of labor (equal to the real wage) has grown by an average of

# TABLE 5-2

Real Rental and Wages in Singapore This table shows the growth rate in the real rental and real wages in Singapore, depending on the method used to construct these factor prices. In part A, a production function approach is used to construct the factor prices, and the real rental falls over time because of the growth in capital. As a result, implied productivity growth is negative. In part B, the rental and wages are constructed from data on payments to capital and labor in Singapore, and real wages grow over time, while the real rental either grows or falls slightly. As a result, implied productivity growth is positive.

[12] In 2005, China had \$318 billion in foreign capital, with another \$533 billion in Hong Kong; Mexico had \$210 billion; Brazil \$202 billion; and Singapore 189 billion, which was 7\% of the total foreign capital in developing countries.

$1.6\%$  per year, as also shown in part A. These estimates of the falling rental and rising wage are consistent with the short-run specific-factors model.

But there is a second way to calculate a rental on capital besides using the marginal product. Under this second approach, we start with the price  $P_K$  of some capital equipment. If that equipment were rented rather than purchased, what would its rental be? Let us suppose that the rental agency needs to make the same rate of return on renting the capital equipment that it would make if it invested its money in some financial asset, such as a savings account in a bank or the stock market. If it invested  $P_K$  and the asset had the interest rate of  $i$ , then it could expect to earn  $P_K \cdot i$  from that asset. On the other hand, if it rents out the equipment, then that machinery also suffers wear and tear, and the rental agency needs to recover that cost, too. If  $d$  is the rate of depreciation of the capital equipment (the fraction of it that is used up each year), then to earn the same return on a financial asset as from renting out the equipment, the rental agency must receive  $P_K \cdot (i + d)$ . This formula is an estimate of  $R$ , the rental on capital. Dividing by an overall price index  $P$ , the real rental is

$$
\frac {R}{P} = \frac {P _ {K}}{P} \cdot (i + d)
$$

In part B of Table 5-2, we show the growth rate in the real rental, computed from this formula, which depends on the interest rate used. In the first row, we use the bank lending rate for  $i$ , and the computed real rental grows by  $1.6\%$  per year. In the next rows, we use two interest rates from the stock market: the return on equity (what you would earn from investing in stocks) and the earnings-price ratio (the profits that each firm earns divided by the value of its outstanding stocks). In both these latter cases, the calculated real rental falls slightly over time, by  $0.2\%$  and  $0.5\%$  per year, much less than the fall in the real rental in part A. According to the calculated real rentals in part B, there is little evidence of a downward fall in the rentals over time.

In part B, we also show the real wage, computed from actual wages paid in Singapore. Real wages grow substantially over time—between  $2.7\%$  and  $3.6\%$  per year, depending on the exact interest rate and period used. This is not what we predicted from our long-run model, in which factor prices would be unchanged by an inflow of capital, because the capital-labor ratios are constant (so the marginal product of labor would not change). That real wages are growing in Singapore, with little change in the real rental, is an indication that there is productivity growth in the economy, which leads to an increase in the marginal product of labor and in the real wage.

We will not discuss how productivity growth is actually measured but just report the findings from the studies in Table 5-2: in part B, productivity growth is between  $1.5\%$  and  $2.2\%$  per year, depending on the period, but in part A, productivity growth is negative! The reason that productivity growth is so much higher in part B is because the average of the growth in the real wage and real rental is rising, which indicates that productivity growth has occurred. In contrast, in part A the average of the growth in the real wage and real rental is zero or negative, indicating that no productivity growth has occurred.

The idea that Singapore might have zero productivity growth contradicts what many people believe about its economy and the economies of other fast-growing Asian countries, which were thought to exhibit "miraculous" growth during this period. If productivity growth is zero or negative, then all growth is due only to capital accumulation, and FDI has no spillover benefits to the local economy. Positive productivity growth, as shown in part B, indicates that the free-market policies pursued by Singapore stimulated innovations in the manufacture of goods that have resulted in higher productivity and lower costs. This is what many economists and policy makers believe happened in Singapore, but this belief is challenged by the productivity calculations in part A. Which scenario is correct—zero or positive productivity growth for Singapore—is a source of ongoing debate in economics. Read the item Headlines: The Myth of Asia's Miracle for one interpretation of the growth in Singapore and elsewhere in Asia.

# The Myth of Asia's Miracle

A CAUTIONARY FABLE: Once upon a time, Western opinion leaders found themselves both impressed and frightened by the extraordinary growth rates achieved by a set of Eastern economies. Although those economies were still substantially poorer and smaller than those of the West, the speed with which they had transformed themselves from peasant societies into industrial powerhouses, their continuing ability to achieve growth rates several times higher than the advanced nations, and their increasing ability to challenge or even surpass American and European technology in certain areas seemed to call into question the dominance not only of Western power but of Western ideology. The leaders of those nations did not share our faith in free markets or unlimited civil liberties. They asserted with increasing self-confidence that their system was superior: societies that accepted strong, even authoritarian governments and were willing to limit individual liberties in the interest of the common good, take charge of their economics, and sacrifice short-run consumer interests for the sake of long-run growth would eventually outperform the increasingly chaotic societies of the West. And a growing minority of Western intellectuals agreed.

The gap between Western and Eastern economic performance eventually be came a political issue. The Democrats recaptured the White House under the leadership of a young, energetic new president who pledged to "get the country moving again"—a pledge that, to him and his closest advisers, meant accelerating America's economic growth to meet the Eastern challenge.

The time, of course, was the early 1960s. The dynamic young president was John F. Kennedy. The technological feats that so alarmed the West were the launch of Sputnik and the early Soviet lead in space. And the rapidly growing Eastern economies were those of the Soviet Union and its satellite nations.

Were you tricked by this fable? Did you think that the "Eastern economies" that the author, Paul Krugman, referred to in the beginning were the Asian economies? Krugman is using this rhetorical trick to suggest that the high growth of the Asian economies is not too different from the growth of the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s, which was due to capital accumulation but without much productivity growth. Other economists disagree and believe that Asian growth is due in significant part to improved productivity, in addition to capital accumulation.

the United States, controls on immigration were first established by the Quota Law of 1921, which limited the number of people arriving annually from each country of origin. The Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965 revised the country-specific limits and allowed immigration on a first-come, first-served basis, up to an annual limit, with special allowances for family members and people in certain occupations. Subsequent revisions to the immigration laws in the United States have established penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, have allowed some illegal immigrants to gain citizenship, or have tightened border controls and deported other illegal immigrants.

Why is immigration so controversial? A glance at articles in the newspaper or on the Internet will show that some groups oppose the spending of public funds on immigrants, such as for schooling, medical care, or welfare. Other groups fear the competition for jobs created by the inflow of foreign workers. We have already seen that immigration creates gains and losses for different groups, often lowering the wage for workers in similar jobs but providing benefits to firms hiring these workers.

This finding raises the important question: Does immigration provide an overall gain to the host country, not including the gains to the immigrants themselves? We presume that the immigrants are better off from higher wages in the country to which they move.[14] But what about the other workers and owners of capital and land in the host country? In the short run, we learned that workers in the host country face competition from the immigrants and receive lower wages, while owners of capital and land benefit from immigration. When we add up these various gains and losses, are there "overall gains" to the destination country, in the same way as we have found overall gains from trade? Fortunately, this answer turns out to be yes.

Immigration benefits the host country in the specific-factors model, not including the income of the immigrants themselves. If we include the immigrant earnings with Foreign income, then we find that emigration benefits the Foreign country, too. The same argument can be made for FDI. An inflow of capital benefits the host country, not including the extra earnings of foreign capital. By counting those extra earnings in Foreign income, then FDI also benefits the source country of the capital. After showing these theoretical results, we discuss how large the overall gains from immigration or FDI flows might be in practice.

# Gains from Immigration

To measure the gains from immigration, we will use the specific-factors model. In Figure 5-14, we measure the world amount of labor on the horizontal axis, which equals  $\overline{L} +\overline{L}^{*}$ . The number of workers in the Home country  $\overline{L}$  is measured from left (the origin 0) to right. The number of workers in Foreign  $\overline{L}^{*}$  is measured from right  $(0^{*})$  to left. Each point on the horizontal axis indicates how many workers are located in the two countries. For example, point  $L$  indicates that  $0L$  workers are located in Home, and  $0^{*}L$  workers are located in the Foreign country.

Wages at Home and Abroad We already know from our discussion earlier in the chapter that as immigrants enter the Home country, the wage is reduced. In Figure 5-14, we graph this relationship as a downward-sloping line labeled "Home

FIGURE 5-14

World Labor Market Initially, Home has  $0L$  workers and Foreign has  $0^{*}L$  workers. The Home wage is  $W$ , as determined at point  $A$ , which is higher than the Foreign wage  $W^{*}$  at  $A^{*}$ . Workers will move from Foreign to Home to receive higher wages. The equilibrium with full migration is at point  $B$ , where wages are equalized at  $W^{\prime}$ . The gain to Home from migration is measured by triangle  $ABC$ , and triangle  $A^{*}BC$  represents the gains to Foreign.

wage." With Home workers of  $0L$  before immigration, the wage is  $W$  at point  $A$ . If Foreign workers enter and the Home labor force grows to  $0L'$ , then the Home wage is reduced to  $W'$  at point  $B$ . The downward-sloping "Home wage" line illustrates the inverse relationship between the number of Home workers and their wage. You can think of this line as a labor demand curve, not for a single industry, but for the economy as a whole.

Similarly, in the Foreign country, there is an inverse relationship between the numbers of workers and their wage. Before any emigration, the labor force in Foreign is  $0^{*}L$ , and we show the wage at  $W^{*}$  at point  $A^{*}$ . That is lower than the Home wage of  $W$ , so some workers will want to migrate from Foreign to Home. Remembering that we measure the Foreign workers from right  $(0^{*})$  to left, when the labor force abroad shrinks from  $0^{*}L$  to  $0^{*}L^{\prime}$ , the Foreign wages rise from  $W^{*}$  to  $W^{\prime}$  at point  $B$ . We see that as Foreign workers leave, it benefits those left behind by raising their wages.

We will refer to point  $B$  as the equilibrium with full migration. At this point, the wages earned at Home and abroad are equalized at  $W'$ . It would certainly take a long time for migration to lead to complete wage equality across countries. In our discussion of emigration from the Old World to the New, we saw in Figure 5-3 that real wages in the New World were still twice as high as wages in Europe even after 40 years of large-scale migration. So the equilibrium with full migration is reached only in the very long run. The question we want to answer is whether this migration has benefited the workers (not including the immigrants), labor, and capital in the Home country. In addition, we want to know whether migration has benefited the Foreign country, including the migrants.

Gains for the Home Country To determine whether there are overall gains for Home, we need to measure the contribution of each Foreign worker to the output of one good or the other in that country. This measurement is easy to do. The marginal product of labor in either industry (multiplied by the price of shoes or computers) equals the Home wage. So the first Foreign worker to migrate has a marginal product equal to the Home wage, which is  $W$  at point  $A$ . As more Foreign workers migrate, the marginal product of labor in both Home industries falls due to diminishing returns. We can measure the immigrants' marginal product by the wage that is paid at Home, which falls from  $W$  to  $W'$  as we move down the Home wage curve from point  $A$  to  $B$ .

At the equilibrium with full migration, point  $B$ , all Foreign immigrants are paid the Home wage of  $W'$ . But all Foreign workers except the last one to enter had a marginal product of labor that is above  $W'$ : the first Foreign worker had a marginal product of  $W$ , and the later Foreign immigrants have lower marginal products, ranging from  $W$  to  $W'$ . Therefore, their contribution to the output of goods in the Home economy exceeds the wage that they are paid. The first Foreign immigrant had a marginal product of  $W$  but receives the wage  $W'$ , so the gain to the Home economy from having that worker is  $(W - W')$ . Likewise, each immigrant to come later has a marginal product between  $W$  and  $W'$  but is still paid the wage  $W'$ , so the difference between their marginal products and wages is a gain for the Home economy.

Adding the gains to the Home economy from the Foreign workers, we end up with the triangle  $ABC$ , which represents the Home gains as a result of full immigration. The reason for these gains is the law of diminishing returns: as more Foreign immigrants enter the Home workforce, their marginal products fall, and because the wage equals the marginal product of the last worker, it must be less than the marginal products of the earlier immigrants. This economic logic guarantees gains to the Home country from migration.

Gains for the Foreign Country Now consider the Foreign country. To assess the overall gains from emigration, we include the wages received by the migrants who left in calculating Foreign income. These wages are often returned to their families (see Side Bar: Immigrants and Their Remittances), but even if they are not, we still incorporate the wages earned by the immigrants in our measure of Foreign income because that is from where the migrants originally came.

In the absence of any emigration, the Foreign wage is  $W^{*}$ , the marginal product of labor in either industry abroad (multiplied by the price of that product in Foreign). As Foreign workers emigrate, the marginal product of labor remaining in Foreign rises, and the Foreign wage rises from  $W^{*}$  to  $W^{\prime}$  (or from points  $A^{*}$  to  $B$  in Figure 5-14). Each of these higher marginal products or wages—between  $W^{*}$  and  $W^{\prime}$ —equals the drop in Foreign output (of either good) from having workers leave.

Under full migration, all Foreign migrants earn the wage  $W'$  in the Home country. Notice that this wage is higher than their Foreign marginal products of labor, which are between  $W^*$  and  $W'$ . The difference between the wage earned by the migrants and their Foreign marginal products equals the gain to Foreign. Adding up the gains over all Foreign emigrants, we obtain the triangle  $A^*BC$ . This gain represents the earnings of the emigrants over and above the drop in output that occurs when they leave Foreign.

World Gains from Migration Combining the gains to the Home and Foreign countries, we obtain the triangular region  $ABA^{*}$ , the world gains from immigration. This magnitude is not too difficult to measure in practice. Turning the triangle on its side, its base equals  $(W - W^{*})$ , the difference in the Home and Foreign wage in the

# Immigrants and Their Remittances

Immigrants often send a substantial portion of their earnings back home, which we refer to as "remittances." According to estimates from the World Bank, remittances to developing countries were  \$406 billion in 2012, up from\$ 372 billion in 2011. In 2011, official aid to foreign governments was \$156 billion, less than half the amount of remittances from immigrants back to their home countries. The countries receiving the largest amount of remittances in 2011 were India (\$64 billion), China (\$62 billion), Mexico (\$24 billion), and the Philippines (\$23 billion). As a share of GDP, however, remittances are highest in smaller and lower-income countries, including Tajikistan (31\%), Lesotho (29\%), Samoa (23\%), Kyrgyz Republic (21\%), and Nepal and Tonga (20\% each). In 2011, there were about 215 million immigrant workers in the world, so the remittances of \$372 billion translate into each immigrant worker sending home approximately 1,800.

In Table 5-3, we show the remittances received by some developing countries in 2010, as compared with their net foreign aid. For all countries except Sudan, the income sent home by emigrants is a larger source of income than official aid. Sudan was experiencing a humanitarian crisis in 2010 so official aid was high. Remittances and official aid are especially important in other African countries, too.

The fact that emigrants return some of their income back home may not be enough to compensate their home countries for the loss of their labor. To calculate any gain to the home countries from the emigration of their workers, we need to include all the earnings of the emigrants in their home countries' income. In reality, however, emigrants do not send all of their income home, so the countries they leave can lose from their outflow. Consider, for example, the case of highly educated migrants. In 2000 there were 1 million Indian-born people with college educations living in the 30 wealthy countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That amounts to  $4.3\%$  of India's large number of college graduates. In 2008,  $53\%$  of Indian-born migrants living in the OECD had a postsecondary education. For Asia as a whole,  $38\%$  of migrants living in the OECD had a postsecondary education. But for some individual countries, the outflow is much larger. Almost  $47\%$  of Ghana's college-educated labor force lives in OECD countries, and for Guyana, the percentage is  $89\%$ .[15] Unless these migrants return most of their earnings back home, those countries lose from the outflow of these highly educated workers.

To address this concern, Jagdish Bhagwati, an Indian-born economist now at Columbia University in New York, has proposed that countries impose a "brain-drain tax" on the outflow of educated workers. The idea is to tax the earnings of people living outside the countries in which they were born and, through an organization such as the United Nations, return the proceeds from the tax to the countries that lose the most workers. In that way, countries with an outflow of educated workers would be compensated, at least in part, for the outflow. A brain-drain tax has been widely debated, but so far it has not been used in practice.

The height of the triangle is  $(L' - L)$ , the number of foreign workers that would emigrate in the equilibrium with full migration. So the area of the triangle is  $\frac{1}{2} (W - W^{*}) \cdot (L' - L)$ . To solve for the area, we need to know the difference in wages before any migration and the number of people who would emigrate.

One way to think about the world gains from migration is that they equal the increase in world GDP due to immigration. To understand why this is so, think about the first person to migrate from Foreign to Home. That person earns the wage  $W^{*}$  in Foreign, which equals his or her marginal product times the price in the industry in which he or she works. When this individual leaves Foreign, GDP in that country falls by  $W^{*}$ . Once he or she moves to Home, he or she earns  $W$ , which again reflects the marginal product times the industry price. So  $W$  equals the increase in Home GDP when the immigrant begins working. The difference between the Home and Foreign wages therefore equals the net increase in world GDP due to migration. By adding up this amount across all migrants, we obtain the triangular region  $ABA^{*}$ , the increase in world GDP and the world gains due to migration.

In practice, however, there are other costs that immigrants bear that would make the gains from immigration less than the increase in world GDP. Immigrants often face sizable moving costs, including the psychological costs of missing their families and home countries as well as monetary payments to traffickers of illegal immigrants. These costs should be subtracted from the increase in GDP to obtain the net gains. Because all the moving costs are hard to quantify, however, in the next application we measure the net gains from immigration by the increase in Home or world GDP.

# APPLICATION

# Gains from Migration

How large are the gains from immigration? For the United States, a study by the economist George Borjas puts the net gain from immigration at about  $0.1\%$  of GDP (one-tenth of  $1\%$  of GDP). That value is obtained by using a stock of immigrants equal to  $10\%$  of the workforce in the United States and assuming that the immigrants compete for the same jobs as U.S. workers. If instead we assume the immigrants are lower-skilled on average than the U.S. population, then the low-skilled immigrants can complement the higher-skilled U.S. population, and the gains from immigration in the United States are somewhat higher, up to  $0.4\%$  of GDP. These estimates are shown in the first row of Table 5-4. The net gains to the United States in this case equal the increase in U.S. GDP.

Borjas's estimates for the U.S. gains from immigration may seem small, but lying behind these numbers is a larger shift in income from labor to capital and landowners. Labor loses from immigration, while capital and landowners gain, and the net effect of all these changes in real income is the gain in GDP that Borjas estimates. For the net gain of  $0.1\%$  of U.S. GDP due to immigration, Borjas estimates that capital would gain  $2\%$  and domestic labor would lose  $1.9\%$  of GDP. These figures lead him to conclude, "The relatively small size of the immigration surplus [that is, the gain in GDP]—particularly when compared to the very large wealth transfers caused by immigration [that is, the shift in income from labor to capital]—probably explains why the debate over immigration policy has usually focused on the potentially harmful labor market impacts rather than the overall increase in native income."

Other calculations suggest that the overall gains from immigration could be larger than Borjas's estimates. In the second row of Table 5-4, we report figures from a study by Kremer and Watt that focuses on just one type of immigrant: household workers. Foreign household workers, who are primarily female, make up  $10\%$  or more of the labor force in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, and about  $7\%$  of the labor force in Hong Kong and Singapore. The presence of these household workers often allows another member of that household—typically, a highly educated woman—to seek employment in her Home country. Thus, the immigration of low-skilled household workers allows for an increase in the high-skilled supply of individuals at Home, generating higher Home GDP as a result. It is estimated that this type of immigration, if it accounts for  $7\%$  of the workforce as in some countries, would increase Home GDP by approximately  $1.2\%$  to  $1.4\%$ .

Another larger estimate of the gains from immigration was obtained in a study by Giovanni Peri, who wrote *Headlines: The Economic Windfall of Immigration Reform*, seen earlier in the chapter. Peri and his co-authors measured the inflow of foreign workers to the United States who are scientists, technology professionals, engineers, or mathematicians—or STEM workers, for short. The H-1B visa program has allowed between 50,000 and 150,000 of these immigrants to enter the United States annually since 1991. Many have remained in the country as permanent residents. By 2010, foreign-born STEM workers accounted for  $1.1\%$  of the population in major cities in the United States, and accounted for  $24\%$  of the total STEM workers (foreign or U.S.-born) found in these cities. Peri and his co-authors measured the productivity gains to these cities from having this inflow of foreign talent, and they found that the gains were substantial: as mentioned in the earlier Headlines article, they found that  $10\%$  to  $20\%$  of the productivity growth in these cities can be explained by the presence of the foreign STEM workers. These productivity gains can come from new start-up technology companies, patents for new inventions, and so on. Adding up these productivity gains over time, the presence of the foreign STEM workers accounted for a  $4\%$  increase in GDP in the United States by 2010.

In part B of Table 5-4, we report results from estimates of gains due to migration for several regions of the world. The first study, by Walmsley and Winters, found that an increase in labor supply to developed countries of  $3\%$ , as a result of immigration from the developing countries, would create world gains of  $0.6\%$  of world GDP. This calculation is similar to the triangle of gains  $ABA^{*}$  shown in Figure 5-14. The next study, by Klein and Ventura, obtains larger estimates of the world gains by modeling the differences in technology across countries. Under this approach, wealthier regions have higher productivity, so an immigrant moving there will be more productive than at home. This productivity increase is offset somewhat by a skill loss for the immigrant (since the immigrant may not find the job for which he or she is best suited, at least initially). Nevertheless, the assumed skill loss is less than the productivity difference between countries, so immigrants are always more productive in the country to which they move.

In their study, Klein and Ventura considered the recent enlargement of the European Union (EU) from 15 countries to 25.[16] Workers from the newly added Eastern European countries are, in principle, permitted to work anywhere in the EU. Klein and Ventura assumed that the original 15 EU countries are twice as productive as the newly added countries. During the first 10 years, they found that the population of those 15 EU countries increased by an estimated  $0.8\%$  to  $1.8\%$ , and the combined GDP in the EU increased by  $0.2\%$  to  $0.7\%$ . The range of these estimates comes from different assumptions about the skill losses of immigrants when they move, and from the psychological costs of their moving, which slow down the extent of migration. As time passed, however, more people flowed from Eastern to Western Europe, and GDP continued to rise. Klein and Ventura estimated that in 25 years the combined GDP of the EU will increase by  $0.6\%$  to  $1.8\%$ , and that over 50 years, the increase in GDP would be  $1.7\%$  to  $4.5\%$ .

Next, Klein and Ventura considered a common labor market within the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), established in 1994, which consists of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Although NAFTA allows for free international trade between these countries, labor mobility is not free. So the experiment that Klein and Ventura considered allowed workers from Mexico to migrate freely to the United States and Canada, which are assumed to have workers who are 1.7 times as productive as those from Mexico. During the first 10 years, they predicted that the population of the United States and Canada would increase by an estimated  $1.0\%$  to  $2.4\%$  due to the immigration from Mexico, and the combined GDP in the NAFTA region would increase by  $0.1\%$  to  $0.4\%$ . After 25 years, they estimated that the combined GDP of the region would increase by  $0.4\%$  to  $1.0\%$ , and over 50 years, the increase in GDP would be  $1.3\%$  to  $3.0\%$ . These estimates are hypothetical because they assume free mobility of labor within the NAFTA countries, which did not occur. In the next chapter we will discuss some other estimates of the gains due to NAFTA, based on the actual experience of the countries involved with free international trade, but without free labor mobility.

# Gains from Foreign Direct Investment

A diagram very similar to Figure 5-14 can be used to measure the gains from FDI. In Figure 5-15, we show the world amount of capital on the horizontal axis, which equals  $\overline{K} + \overline{K}^*$ . The rental earned in each country is on the vertical axis. With  $0K$  units of capital employed at Home (measured from left to right), the Home rental is  $R$ , determined at point  $A$ . The remaining capital  $0^*K$  (measured from right to left) is in Foreign, and the Foreign rental is  $R^*$ , determined at point  $A^*$ .

FIGURE 5-15

World Capital Market With OK units of capital at Home, the Home rental is  $R$  at point  $A$ . The remaining capital  $0^{*}K$  is in Foreign, and the Foreign rental is  $R^{*}$  at point  $A^{*}$ . Capital will move from Home to Foreign to receive a higher rental. The equilibrium with full capital flows is at point  $B$ , where rentals are equalized at  $R^{\prime}$ . Triangle ABC measures the gains to Home from the capital outflow, and triangle  $A^{*}BC$  measures the gains to Foreign.

Because the Foreign rental is higher than that at Home, capital will flow from Home to Foreign. As it enters Foreign, the additional capital will reduce the marginal product of capital and bid down the rental. Likewise, as capital leaves Home, the marginal product of capital will increase, and the Home rental will be bid up. The equilibrium with full capital flows is at point  $B$ , where rentals are equalized at  $R'$ . Similar to what we found in the case of immigration, the gains to Home from the capital outflow is the triangle  $ABC$ , while the gains to Foreign is the triangle  $A^{*}BC$  and the world gains are  $A^{*}BA$ .

# 4 Conclusions

Immigration, the movement of workers between countries, potentially affects the wages in the host country in which the workers arrive. In the short-run specific-factor model, a larger supply of workers due to immigration will lower wages. Most immigrants into the United States have either the lowest or the highest amounts of education. As a result, after an inflow of labor from other countries, the wages of these two groups of workers fall in the short run. The majority of U.S. workers, those with mid-levels of education, are not affected that much by immigration. Moreover, the arrival of immigrants is beneficial to owners of capital and land in the specific-factors model. As wages are reduced in the short run, the rentals on capital and land will rise. This result helps to explain why landowners lobby for programs to allow agricultural workers to immigrate at least temporarily, and why other industries support increased immigration, such as H1-B visas for workers in the high-technology and other professional industries.

In a long-run framework, when capital can move between industries, the fall in wages will not occur. Instead, the industries that use labor intensively can expand and other industries contract, so that the immigrants become employed without any fall in wages. This change in industry outputs is the main finding of the Rybczynski theorem. The evidence from the Mariel boat lift in 1980 suggests that a readjustment of industry outputs along these lines occurred in Miami after the arrival of immigrants from Cuba: the output of the apparel industry fell by less than predicted from other cities, whereas the output of some skill-intensive industries fell by more than predicted.

The movement of capital between countries is referred to as foreign direct investment (FDI) and has effects analogous to immigration. In the short run, the entry of foreign capital into a country will lower the rental on capital, raise wages, and lower the rental on land. But in the long run, when capital and land can move between industries, these changes in the wage and rentals need not occur. Instead, industry outputs can adjust according to the Rybczynski theorem so that the extra capital is fully employed without any change in the wage or rentals. Evidence from Singapore suggests that foreign capital can be absorbed without a large decline in the rental or the marginal product of capital, though this is an area of ongoing debate in economics.

Both immigration and FDI create world gains as labor and capital move from countries with low marginal products to countries with high marginal products. Gains for the host country are created because the inflow of labor and capital is paid an amount that is less than its full contribution to GDP in the host country. At the same time, there are also gains to the labor and capital in the country they leave, provided that the income earned by the emigrants or capital is included in that country's welfare.

# KEY POINTS

1. Holding the amount of capital and land fixed in both industries, as in the specific-factors model, immigration leads to a fall in wages. This was the case, for example, with the mass migration to the New World in the nineteenth century.
2. As wages fall because of immigration, the marginal products of the specific factors (capital and land) rise, and therefore their rentals also increase.
3. Fixing the amount of capital and land in a country is a reasonable assumption in the short run, but in the longer run, firms will move capital between industries, which will change the effect of immigration on wages and rentals.
4. In a long-run model with two goods and two factors, both of which are perfectly mobile between the industries, additional labor from immigration will be absorbed entirely by the labor-intensive industry. Furthermore, the labor-intensive industry will also absorb additional capital and labor from the capital-intensive industry, so its capital-labor ratio does not change in the long run. Because the capital-labor ratio in each industry does not change, the wage and rentals remain the same as well. This results in what is known as factor price insensitivity.
5. According to the Rybczynski theorem, immigration will lead to an increase in output in the labor-intensive industry and a decrease in the output of the capital-intensive industry. This result is different from that of the short-run specific-factors model, in which immigration leads to increased output in both industries.
6. Besides trade in goods and the movement of labor, another way that countries interact with one another is through investment. When a company owns property, plant, or equipment in another country, it is called foreign direct investment, or FDI.
7. In the short run, FDI lowers the rentals on capital and land and raises wages. In the long run, the extra capital can be absorbed in the capital-intensive industry without any change in the wage or rental.
8. According to the Rybczynski theorem, FDI will lead to an increase in the output of the capital-intensive industry and a decrease in the output of the labor-intensive industry.
9. The movement of capital and labor generates overall gains for both the source and host countries, provided that the income of the emigrants is included in the source country's welfare. Hence, there are global gains from immigration and FDI.

# PROBLEMS

1. In the short-run specific-factors model, examine the impact on a small country following a natural disaster that decreases its population. Assume that land is specific to agriculture and capital is specific to manufacturing, whereas labor is free to move between the two sectors.

a. In a diagram similar to Figure 5-2, determine the impact of the decrease in the workforce on the output of each industry and the equilibrium wage.

b. What happens to the rentals on capital and land?

2. How would your answer to Problem 1 change if instead we use the long-run model, with shoes and computers produced using labor and capital?
3. Consider an increase in the supply of labor due to immigration, and use the long-run model. Figure 5-8 shows the box diagram and the leftward shift of the origin for the shoe industry. Redraw this diagram but instead shift to the right the origin for computers. That is, expand the labor axis by the amount  $\Delta L$  but shift it to the right rather than to the left. With the new diagram, show how the amount of labor and capital in shoes and computers is determined, without any change in factor prices. Carefully explain what has happened to the amount of labor and capital used in each industry and to the output of each industry.
4. In the short-run specific-factors model, consider a decrease in the stock of land. For example, suppose a natural disaster decreases the quantity of arable land used for planting crops.

a. Redraw panel (a) of Figure 5-11 starting from the initial equilibrium at point A.

b. What is the effect of this change in land on the quantity of labor in each industry and on the equilibrium wage?

c. What is the effect on the rental on land and the rental on capital?

d. Now suppose that the international community wants to help the country struck by the natural disaster and decides to do so by increasing its level of FDI. So the rest of the world increases its investment in physical capital in the stricken country. Illustrate the effect of this policy on the equilibrium wage and rentals.

5. According to part A of Table 5-1, what education level loses most (i.e., has the greatest decrease in wage) from immigration to the United States? Does this result depend on keeping the rental on capital constant? Explain why or why not.
6. Suppose that computers use 2 units of capital for each worker, so that  $K_{C} = 2 \cdot L_{C}$ , whereas shoes use 0.5 unit of capital for each worker, so that  $K_{S} = 0.5 \cdot L_{S}$ . There are 100 workers and 100 units of capital in the economy.

a. Solve for the amount of labor and capital used in each industry.

Hint: The box diagram shown in Figure 5-7 means that the amount of labor and capital used in each industry must add up to the total for the economy, so that

$$
K _ {C} + K _ {S} = 1 0 0 \text {a n d} L _ {C} + L _ {S} = 1 0 0
$$

Use the facts that  $K_{C} = 2 \cdot L_{C}$  and  $K_{S} = 0.5 \cdot L_{S}$  to rewrite these equations as

$$
2 \cdot L _ {C} + 0. 5 \cdot L _ {S} = 1 0 0 \text {a n d} L _ {C} + L _ {S} = 1 0 0
$$

Use these two equations to solve for  $L_{C}$  and  $L_{S}$ , and then calculate the amount of capital used in each industry using  $K_{C} = 2 \cdot L_{C}$  and  $K_{S} = 0.5 \cdot L_{S}$ .

b. Suppose that the number of workers increases to 125 due to immigration, keeping total capital fixed at 100. Again, solve for the amount of labor and capital used in each industry. Hint: Redo the calculations from part (a), but using  $L_{C} + L_{S} = 125$ .

c. Suppose instead that the amount of capital increases to 125 due to FDI, keeping the total number of workers fixed at 100. Again solve for the amount of labor and capital used in each industry. Hint: Redo the calculations from part (a), using  $K_{C} + K_{S} = 125$ .

d. Explain how your results in parts (b) and (c) are related to the Rybczynski theorem.

Questions 7 and 8 explore the implications of the Rybczynski theorem and the factor price insensitivity result for the Heckscher-Oblin model from Chapter 4.

7. In this question, we use the Rybczynski theorem to review the derivation of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem.

a. Start at the no-trade equilibrium point A on the Home PPF in Figure 4-2, panel (a). Suppose that through immigration, the amount of labor in Home grows. Draw the new PPF, and label the point  $B$  where production would occur with the same prices for goods. Hint: You can refer to Figure 5-9 to see the effect of immigration on the PPF.

b. Suppose that the only difference between Foreign and Home is that Foreign has more labor. Otherwise, the technologies used to produce each good are the same across countries. Then how does the Foreign PPF compare with the new Home PPF (including immigration) that you drew in part (a)? Is point  $B$  the no-trade equilibrium in Foreign? Explain why or why not.

c. Illustrate a new point  $A^*$  that is the no-trade equilibrium in Foreign. How do the relative no-trade prices of computers compare in Home and Foreign? Therefore, what will be the pattern of trade between the countries, and why?

8. Continuing from Problem 7, we now use the factor price insensitivity result to compare factor prices across countries in the Heckscher-Ohlin model.

a. Illustrate the international trade equilibrium on the Home and Foreign production possibilities frontiers. Hint: You can refer to Figure 4-3 to see the international trade equilibrium.

b. Suppose that the only difference between Foreign and Home is that Foreign has more labor. Otherwise, the technologies used to produce each good are the same across countries. Then, according to the factor price insensitivity result, how will the wage and rental compare in the two countries?

c. Call the result in part (b) "factor price equalization." Is this a realistic result? Hint: You can refer to Figure 4-9 to see wages across countries.

d. Based on our extension of the Heckscher-Ohlin model at the end of Chapter 4, what is one reason why the factor price equalization result does not hold in reality?

9. Recall the formula from the application "The Effect of FDI on Rentals and Wages in Singapore." Give an intuitive explanation for this formula for the rental rate. Hint: Describe one side of the equation as a marginal benefit and the other as a marginal cost.
10. In Table 5-2, we show the growth in the real rental and real wages in Singapore, along with the implied productivity growth. One way to calculate the productivity growth is to take the average of the growth in the real rental and real wage. The idea is that firms can afford to pay more to labor and capital if there is productivity growth, so in that case real factor prices should be growing. But if there is no productivity growth, then the average of the growth in the real rental and real wage should be close to zero.

To calculate the average of the growth in the real factor prices, we use the shares of GDP going to capital and labor. Specifically, we multiply the growth in the real rental by the capital share of GDP and add the growth in the real wage multiplied by the labor share of GDP. Then answer the following: a. For a capital-rich country like Singapore, the share of capital in GDP is about one-half and the share of labor is also one-half. Using these shares, calculate the average of the growth in the real rental and real wage shown in each row of Table 5-2. How do your answers compare with the productivity growth shown in the last column of Table 5-2?

b. For an industrialized country like the United States, the share of capital in GDP is about one-third and the share of labor in GDP is about two-thirds. Using these shares, calculate the average of the growth in the real rental and real wage shown in each row of Table 5-2. How do your answers now compare with the productivity growth shown in the last column?

11. Figure 5-14 is a supply and demand diagram for the world labor market. Starting at points  $A$  and  $A^{*}$ , consider a situation in which some Foreign workers migrate to Home but not enough to reach the equilibrium with full migration (point  $B$ ). As a result of the migration, the Home wage decreases from  $W$  to  $W'' > W'$ , and the Foreign wage increases from  $W^{*}$  to  $W^{**} < W'$ .

a. Are there gains that accrue to the Home country? If so, redraw the graph and identify the magnitude of the gains for each country. If not, say why not.

b. Are there gains that accrue to the Foreign country? If so, again show the magnitude of these gains in the diagram and also show the world gains.

12. A housekeeper from the Philippines is contemplating immigrating to Singapore in search of higher wages. Suppose the house-keeper earns approximately  \$2,000 annually and expects to find a job in Singapore worth approximately\$ 5,000 annually for a period of three years. Furthermore, assume that the cost of living in Singapore is 500 more per year than at home.

a. What can we say about the productivity of housekeepers in Singapore versus the Philippines? Explain.

b. What is the total gain to the housekeeper from migrating?

c. Is there a corresponding gain for the employer in Singapore? Explain.
