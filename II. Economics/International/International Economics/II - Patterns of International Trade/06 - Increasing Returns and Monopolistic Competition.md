# Increasing Returns to Scale and Monopolistic Competition

Foreign trade, then, … [is] highly beneficial to a country, as it increases the amount and variety of the objects on which revenue may be expended.

David Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, Chapter 7

The idea that a simple government policy [free trade between Canada and the United States] could raise productivity so dramatically is to me truly remarkable.

Professor Daniel Trefler, University of Toronto, 2005

In Chapter 2, we looked at data for U.S. snowboard imports and considered the reasons why the United States imports this product from so many different countries. Now we look at another sporting good that the United States imports and exports in large quantities to illustrate how a country can both buy a product and sell it to other countries. In 2012 the United States imported golf clubs from 25 countries and exported them to 74 countries. In Table 6-1, we list the 12 countries that sell the most golf clubs to the United States and the 12 countries to which the United States sells the most golf clubs. The table also lists the amounts bought or sold and their average wholesale prices.

In panel (a), we see that China sells the most clubs to the United States, providing  \$385 million worth of golf clubs at an average price of\$ 27 each. Next is Mexico, selling \$45 million of clubs at an average wholesale price of \$70 each. Vietnam comes next, exporting \$26 million of clubs at an average price of \$51, followed by Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, each of which sells golf clubs to the United States with an

U.S. Imports and Exports of Golf Clubs, 2012 This table shows the value, quantity, and average price for golf clubs imported into and exported from the United States. Many of the same countries both sell golf clubs to and buy golf clubs from the United States, illustrating what we call intra-industry trade.

The higher average prices of golf clubs from these three countries as compared with Chinese and Vietnamese clubs most likely indicate that the clubs sold by Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand are of much higher quality. The clubs from the other top-selling countries have wholesale prices below\$ 30. In total, the United States imported 476 million of golf clubs in 2012.

On the export side, shown in panel (b), the top destination for U.S. clubs is Japan, followed by Canada and South Korea. Notice that these three countries are also among the top 12 countries selling golf clubs to the United States. The average price for U.S. exports varies between  \$69 and\$ 142 per club, higher than the price of all the imported clubs, except those from Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, which suggests that the United States is exporting high-quality clubs.

Many of the countries that sell to the United States also buy from the United States: 6 of the top 12 selling countries were also among the top 12 countries buying U.S. golf clubs in 2012. Of the 25 selling countries, 24 also bought U.S. golf clubs (the only country that sold clubs to the United States but did not also buy them was Bangladesh). Why does the United States export and import golf clubs to and from the same countries? The answer to this question is one of the "new" explanations for trade that we study in this chapter and the next. The Ricardian model (Chapter 2) and the Heckscher-Ohlin model (Chapter 4) explained why nations would either import or export a good, but those models do not predict the simultaneous import and export of a product, as we observe for golf clubs and many other goods.

To explain why countries import and export the same product, we need to change some assumptions made in the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models. In those models, we assumed that markets were perfectly competitive, which means there are many small producers, each producing a homogeneous (identical) product, so none of them can influence the market price for the product. As we know just from walking down the aisles in a grocery or department store, most goods are differentiated goods; that is, they are not identical. Based on price differences in Table 6-1, we can see that the traded golf clubs are of different types and quality. So in this chapter, we drop the assumption that the goods are homogeneous, as in perfect competition, and instead assume that goods are differentiated and allow for imperfect competition, in which case firms can influence the price that they charge.

The new explanation for trade explored in this chapter involves a type of imperfect competition called monopolistic competition, which has two key features. The first feature, just mentioned, is that the goods produced by different firms are differentiated. By offering different products, firms are able to exert some control over the price they can charge for their particular product. Because the market in which the firms operate is not a perfectly competitive one, they do not have to accept the market price, and by increasing their price, they do not lose all their business to competitors. On the other hand, because these firms are not monopolists (i.e., they are not the only firm that produces this type of product), they cannot charge prices as high as a monopolist would. When firms produce differentiated products, they retain some ability to set the price for their product, but not as much as a monopolist would have.

The second feature of monopolistic competition is increasing returns to scale, by which we mean that the average costs for a firm fall as more output is produced. For this reason, firms tend to specialize in the product lines that are most successful—by selling more of those products, the average cost for the production of the successful products falls. Firms can lower their average costs by selling more in their home markets but can possibly attain even lower costs from selling more in foreign markets through exporting. So increasing returns to scale create a reason for trade to occur even when the trading countries are similar in their technologies and factor endowments. Increasing returns to scale set the monopolistic competition trade model apart from the logic of the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models.

In this chapter, we describe a model of trade under monopolistic competition that incorporates product differentiation and increasing returns to scale. After describing the monopolistic competition model, the next goal of the chapter is to discuss how this model helps explain trade patterns that we observe today. In our golf club example, countries specialize in different varieties of the same type of product and trade them; this type of trade is called intra-industry trade because it deals with imports and exports in the same industry. The monopolistic competition model explains this trade pattern and also predicts that larger countries will trade more with one another. Just as the force of gravity is strongest between two large objects, the monopolistic competition model implies that large countries (as measured by their GDP) should trade the most. There is a good deal of empirical evidence to support this prediction, which is called the gravity equation.

The monopolistic competition model also helps us to understand the effects of free-trade agreements, in which free trade occurs among a group of countries. In this chapter, we use the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to illustrate the predictions of the monopolistic competition model. The policy implications of free-trade agreements are discussed in a later chapter.

# 1 Basics of Imperfect Competition

Monopolistic competition incorporates some aspects of a monopoly (firms have control over the prices they charge) and some aspects of perfect competition (many firms are selling). Before presenting the monopolistic competition model, it is useful to review the case of monopoly, which is a single firm selling a product. The monopoly firm faces the industry demand curve. After that, we briefly discuss the case of duopoly, when there are two firms selling a product. Our focus will be on the demand facing each of the two firms. Understanding what happens to demand in a duopoly will help us understand how demand is determined when there are many firms selling differentiated products, as occurs in monopolistic competition.

# Monopoly Equilibrium

In Figure 6-1, the industry demand curve is shown by  $D$ . For the monopolist to sell more, the price must fall, and so the demand curve slopes downward. This fall in price means that the extra revenue earned by the monopolist from selling another unit is less than the price of that unit—the extra revenue earned equals the price charged for that unit minus the fall in price times the quantity sold of all earlier units. The extra revenue earned from selling one more unit is called the marginal revenue and is shown by the curve  $MR$  in Figure 6-1. The marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve  $D$  because the extra revenue earned from selling another unit is less than the price.

FIGURE 6-1

Monopoly Equilibrium The monopolist chooses the profit-maximizing quantity,  $Q^M$ , at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. From that quantity, we trace up to the demand curve and over to the price axis to see that the monopolist charges the price  $P^M$ . The monopoly equilibrium is at point  $A$ .

To maximize its profit, the monopolist sells up to the point at which the marginal revenue  $MR$  earned from selling one more unit equals the marginal cost  $MC$  of producing one more unit. In Figure 6-1, the marginal cost curve is shown by  $MC$ . Because we have assumed, for simplicity, that marginal costs are constant, the  $MC$  curve is flat, although this does not need to be the case. To have marginal revenue equal marginal costs, the monopolist sells the quantity  $Q^{M}$ . To find the profit-maximizing price the monopolist charges, we trace up from quantity  $Q^{M}$  to point  $A$  on the demand curve and then over to the price axis. The price charged by the monopolist  $P^{M}$  is the price that allows the monopolist to earn the highest profit and is therefore the monopoly equilibrium.

# Demand with Duopoly

Let us compare a monopoly with a duopoly, a market structure in which two firms are selling a product. We will not solve for the duopoly equilibrium but will just study how the introduction of a second firm affects the demand facing each of the firms. Knowing how demand is affected by the introduction of a second firm helps us understand how demand is determined when there are many firms, as there are in monopolistic competition.

In Figure 6-2, the industry faces the demand curve  $D$ . If there are two firms in the industry and they charge the same price, then the demand curve facing each firm is  $D / 2$ . For example, if both firms charged the price  $P_{1}$ , then the industry demand is at point  $A$ , and each firm's demand is at point  $B$  on curve  $D / 2$ . The two firms share the market equally, each selling exactly one-half of the total market demand,  $Q_{2} = Q_{1} / 2$ .

If one firm charges a price different from the other firm, however, the demand facing both firms changes. Suppose that one firm charges a lower price  $P_{2}$ , while the other firm keeps its price at  $P_{1}$ . If the firms are selling the same homogeneous product, then the firm charging the lower price would get all the demand (shown by point  $C$ ), which

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/a6e8a20d7e235c43b6225f876a20b15abb67b5b7eb8fcbb13b923b866fc69102.jpg)

FIGURE 6-2

Demand Curves with Duopoly When there are two firms in the market and they both charge the same price, each firm faces the demand curve  $D / 2$ . At the price  $P_{1}$ , the industry produces  $Q_{1}$  at point  $A$  and each firm produces  $Q_{2} = Q_{1} / 2$  at point  $B$ . If both firms produce identical products and one firm lowers its price to  $P_{2}$ , all consumers will buy from that firm only; the firm that lowers its price will face the demand curve,  $D$ , and sell  $Q_{3}$  at point  $C$ . Alternatively, if the products are differentiated, the firm that lowers its price will take some, but not all, sales from the other firm; it will face the demand curve,  $d$ , and at  $P_{2}$  it will sell  $Q_{4}$  at point  $C'$ .

is  $Q_{3}$  at the price  $P_{2}$ . Now suppose that the products are not homogeneous but instead are differentiated. In that case, the firm with the lower price  $P_{2}$  will capture more of the market than the firm with the higher price  $P_{1}$ , but will not capture the entire market. Because the products are not precisely the same (for instance, in our golf club example the higher-priced club is of better quality than the less expensive club), some consumers will still want to buy the other firm's product even though its price is higher. The firm selling at the lower price  $P_{2}$  now sells the quantity  $Q_{4}$ , for example, at point  $C'$ .

The demand curve  $d$  is the demand curve for the firm that lowered its price from  $P_{1}$  to  $P_{2}$ , even though the other firm held its price at  $P_{1}$ . As we have illustrated, the demand curve  $d$  is flatter than the demand curve  $D / 2$ . This means that each firm faces a more elastic demand curve than  $D / 2$ : when only one firm lowers its price, it increases its quantity sold by more than when all firms lower their prices. Not only does the quantity demanded in the industry increase, but in addition, the firm that lowers its price takes away some of the quantity demanded from the other firm. In summary, the demand curve  $d$  facing each firm producing in a duopoly is more elastic than the demand curve  $D / 2$  each faces when the firms charge the same price.

# 2 Trade Under Monopolistic Competition

We begin our study of monopolistic competition by carefully stating the assumptions of the model.

Assumption 1: Each firm produces a good that is similar to but differentiated from the goods that other firms in the industry produce.

Because each firm's product is somewhat different from the goods of the other firms, a firm can raise its price without losing all its customers to other firms. Thus, each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve for its product and has some control over the price it charges. This is different from perfect competition, in which all firms produce exactly the same product and therefore must sell at exactly the same market-determined price.

# Assumption 2: There are many firms in the industry.

The discussion of duopoly demand in the previous section helps us to think about the demand curve facing a firm under monopolistic competition, when there are many firms in the industry. If the number of firms is  $N$ , then  $D / N$  is the share of demand that each firm faces when the firms are all charging the same price. When only one firm lowers its price, however, it will face a flatter demand curve  $d$ . We will begin describing the model by focusing on the demand curve  $d$  and later bring back the demand curve  $D / N$ .

The first two assumptions are about the demand facing each firm; the third assumption is about each firm's cost structure:

Assumption 3: Firms produce using a technology with increasing returns to scale.

The assumptions underlying monopolistic competition differ from our usual assumptions on firm costs by allowing for increasing returns to scale, a production technology in which the average costs of production fall as the quantity produced increases. This relationship is shown in Figure 6-3, in which average costs are labeled  $AC$ . The assumption that average costs fall as quantity increases means that marginal costs, labeled  $MC$ , must be below average costs. Why? Think about whether a new student coming into your class will raise or lower the class average grade. If the new student's average is below the existing class average, then when he or she enters, the class average will fall. In the same way, when  $MC$  is less than  $AC$ , then  $AC$  must be falling.

FIGURE 6-3

Increasing Returns to Scale This diagram shows the average cost,  $AC$ , and marginal cost,  $MC$ , of a firm. Increasing returns to scale cause average costs to fall as the quantity produced increases. Marginal cost is below average cost and is drawn as constant for simplicity.

Numerical Example As an example of the cost curves in Figure 6-3, suppose that the firm has the following cost data:

$$
\text {F i x e d c o s t s} = \$ 1 0 0
$$

$$
\text {M a r g i n a l} = \$ 10 \text {p e r u n i t}
$$

Given these costs, the average costs for this firm for various quantities are as shown in Table 6-2.

Notice that as the quantity produced rises, average costs fall and eventually become close to the marginal costs of 10 per unit, as shown in Figure 6-3.

Assumption 3 means that average cost is above marginal cost. Assumption 1 means that firms have some control over the price they charge, and these firms charge a price that is also above marginal cost (we learn why in a later section).

Whenever the price charged is above average cost, a firm earns monopoly profit. Our final assumption describes what happens to profits in a monopolistically competitive industry in the long run:

Assumption 4: Because firms can enter and exit the industry freely, monopoly profits are zero in the long run.

Recall that under perfect competition, we assume there are many firms in the industry and that in a long-run equilibrium each firm's profit must be zero. In monopolistic competition, there is the same requirement for a long-run equilibrium. We assume that firms can enter and exit the industry freely; this means that firms will enter as long as it is possible to make monopoly profits, and as more firms enter, the profit per firm falls. This condition leads to a long-run equilibrium in which profit for each firm is zero, just as in perfect competition!

FIGURE 6-4

Short-Run Monopolistic Competition Equilibrium without Trade The short-run equilibrium under monopolistic competition is the same as a monopoly equilibrium. The firm chooses to produce the quantity  $Q_{0}$  at which the firm's marginal revenue,  $mr_{0}$ , equals its marginal cost,  $MC$ . The price charged is  $P_{0}$ . Because price exceeds average cost, the firm makes a monopoly profit.

curve faced by each firm is labeled  $d_0$ , the marginal revenue curve is labeled  $mr_0$ , and the marginal cost curve of each firm is shown by  $MC$ . Each firm maximizes profit by producing  $Q_0$ , the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Tracing up from this quantity to the demand curve shows that the price charged by the firms is  $P_0$ . Because the price exceeds average costs at the quantity  $Q_0$ , the firm earns monopoly profit.

Long-Run Equilibrium In a monopolistically competitive market, new firms continue to enter the industry as long as they can earn monopoly profits. In the long run, the entry of new firms draws demand away from existing firms, causing demand curve  $d_0$  to shift to the left until no firm in the industry earns positive monopoly profits (Figure 6-5). Moreover, when new firms enter and there are more product varieties available to consumers, the  $d_0$  curve faced by each firm becomes more elastic, or flatter. We expect the  $d_0$  curve to become more elastic as more firms enter because each product is similar to the other existing products; therefore, as the number of close substitutes increases, consumers become more price sensitive.

New firms continue to enter the industry until the price charged by each firm is on the average cost curve and monopoly profit is zero. At this point, the industry is in a long-run equilibrium, with no reason for any further entry or exit. The long-run equilibrium without trade is shown in Figure 6-5. Again, the demand curve for the firm is labeled  $d$ , with the short-run demand curve denoted  $d_0$  and the long-run demand curve denoted  $d_1$  (with corresponding marginal revenue curve  $mr_1$ ). Marginal revenue equals marginal cost at quantity  $Q_1$ . At this quantity, all firms in the industry charge price  $P^A$ . The price  $P^A$  equals average cost at point  $A$ , where the demand curve  $d_1$  is tangent to the average cost curve. Because the price equals average costs, the firm is earning zero monopoly profit and there is no incentive for firms to enter or exit the industry. Thus, point  $A$  is the firm's (and the industry's) long-run equilibrium without trade. Notice that the long-run equilibrium curve  $d_1$  is to the left of and more elastic (flatter) than the short-run curve  $d_0$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/331e13693ddaa536e95fd49157ad58cb740032f1fd2aac92faaab24d2ea68870.jpg)

FIGURE 6-5

Long-Run Monopolistic Competition Equilibrium Without Trade Drawn by the possibility of making profits in the short-run equilibrium, new firms enter the industry and the firm's demand curve,  $d_0$ , shifts to the left and becomes more elastic (i.e., flatter), shown by  $d_1$ . The long-run equilibrium under monopolistic competition occurs at the quantity  $Q_1$  where the marginal revenue curve,  $mr_1$  (associated with demand curve  $d_1$ ), equals marginal cost. At that quantity, the no-trade price,  $P^A$ , equals average costs at point  $A$ . In the long-run equilibrium, firms earn zero monopoly profits and there is no entry or exit. The quantity produced by each firm is less than that in short-run equilibrium (Figure 6-4).  $Q_1$  is less than  $Q_0$  because new firms have entered the industry. With a greater number of firms and hence more varieties available to consumers, the demand for each variety  $d_1$  is less than  $d_0$ . The demand curve  $D / N^A$  shows the no-trade demand when all firms charge the same price.

Before we allow for international trade, we need to introduce another curve into Figure 6-5. The firm's demand curve  $d_{1}$  shows the quantity demanded depending on the price charged by that firm, holding the price charged by all other firms fixed. In contrast, there is another demand curve that shows the quantity demanded from each firm when all firms in the industry charge the same price. This other demand curve is the total market demand  $D$  divided by the number of firms in the absence of trade  $N^{\mathcal{A}}$ . In Figure 6-5, we label the second demand curve as  $D / N^{\mathcal{A}}$ . We omit drawing total industry demand  $D$  itself so we do not clutter the diagram.

The demand curve  $d_{1}$  is flatter, or more elastic, than the demand curve  $D / N^{\mathcal{A}}$ . We discussed why that is the case under duopoly (see Figure 6-2) and can review the reason again now. Starting at point  $A$ , consider a drop in the price by just one firm, which increases the quantity demanded along the  $d_{1}$  curve for that firm. The demand curve  $d_{1}$  is quite elastic, meaning that the drop in price leads to a large increase in the quantity purchased because customers are attracted away from other firms. If instead all firms drop their price by the same amount, along the curve  $D / N^{\mathcal{A}}$ , then each firm will not attract as many customers away from other firms. When all firms drop their prices equally, then the increase in quantity demanded from each firm along the curve  $D / N^{\mathcal{A}}$  is less than the increase along the firm's curve  $d_{1}$ . Thus, demand is less elastic along the demand curve  $D / N^{\mathcal{A}}$ , which is why it is steeper than the  $d_{1}$  curve. As we proceed with our analysis of opening trade under monopolistic competition, it will be helpful to keep track of both of these demand curves.

# Equilibrium with Free Trade

Let us now allow for free trade between Home and Foreign in this industry. For simplicity, we assume that Home and Foreign countries are exactly the same, with the same number of consumers, the same factor endowments, the same technology and cost curves, and the same number of firms in the no-trade equilibrium. If there were no increasing returns to scale, there would be no reason at all for international trade to occur. Under the Ricardian model, for example, countries with identical technologies would not trade because their no-trade relative prices would be equal. Likewise, under the Heckscher-Ohlin model, countries with identical factor endowments would not trade because their no-trade relative prices would be the same. Under monopolistic competition, however, two identical countries will still engage in international trade because increasing returns to scale exist.

Short-Run Equilibrium with Trade We take as given the number of firms in the no-trade equilibrium in each country  $N^A$  and use this number of firms to determine the short-run equilibrium with trade. Our starting point is the long-run equilibrium without trade, as shown by point  $A$  in Figure 6-5 and reproduced in Figure 6-6. When we allow free trade between Home and Foreign, the number of consumers available to each firm doubles (because there is an equal number of consumers in each country) as does the number of firms (because there is an equal number of firms in each country). Because there are not only twice as many consumers but also twice as many firms, the demand curve  $D / N^A$  is the same as it was before,  $2D / 2N^A = D / N^A$ . In other words, point  $A$  is still on the demand curve  $D / N^A$ , as shown in Figure 6-6.

Free trade doubles the number of firms, which also doubles the product varieties available to consumers. With a greater number of product varieties available to consumers, their demand for each individual variety will be more elastic. That is, if one firm drops its price below the no-trade price  $P^A$ , then it can expect to attract an even greater number of customers away from other firms. Before trade the firm would attract additional Home customers only, but after trade it will attract additional Home and Foreign consumers. In Figure 6-6, this consumer response is shown by the firm's new demand curve  $d_2$ , which is more elastic than its no-trade demand curve  $d_1$ . As a result, the demand curve  $d_2$  is no longer tangent to the average cost curve at point  $A$

FIGURE 6-6

Short-Run Monopolistic Competition Equilibrium with Trade When trade is opened, the larger market makes the firm's demand curve more elastic, as shown by  $d_{2}$  (with corresponding marginal revenue curve,  $mr_{2}$ ). The firm chooses to produce the quantity  $Q_{2}$  at which marginal revenue equals marginal costs; this quantity corresponds to a price of  $P_{2}$ . With sales of  $Q_{2}$  at price  $P_{2}$ , the firm will make monopoly profits because price is greater than AC. When all firms lower their prices to  $P_{2}$ , however, the relevant demand curve is  $D / N^{A}$ , which indicates that they can sell only  $Q_{2}'$  at price  $P_{2}$ . At this short-run equilibrium (point  $B'$ ), price is less than average cost and all firms incur losses. As a result, some firms are forced to exit the industry.

but is above average costs for prices below  $P^A$ . The new demand curve  $d_2$  has a corresponding marginal revenue curve  $mr_2$ , as shown in Figure 6-6.

With the new demand curve  $d_{2}$  and new marginal revenue curve  $mr_{2}$ , the firm again needs to choose its profit-maximizing level of production. As usual, that level will be where marginal revenue equals marginal cost at  $Q_{2}$ . When we trace from  $Q_{2}$  up to point  $B$  on the firm's demand curve  $d_{2}$ , then over to the price axis, we see that the firm will charge  $P_{2}$ . Because  $P_{2}$  is above average cost at point  $B$ , the firm will make a positive monopoly profit. We can see clearly the firm's incentive to lower its price: at point  $A$  it earns zero monopoly profit and at point  $B$  it earns positive profit. Producing  $Q_{2}$  and selling it at  $P_{2}$  is the firm's profit-maximizing position.

This happy scenario for the firm is not the end of the story, however. Every firm in the industry (in both Home and Foreign) has the same incentive to lower its price in the hope of attracting customers away from all the other firms and earning monopoly profit. When all firms lower their prices at the same time, however, the quantity demanded from each firm increases along the demand curve  $D / N^{A}$ , not along  $d_{2}$ . Remember that the  $D / N^{A}$  curve shows the demand faced by each firm when all firms in the industry charge the same price. With the prices of all firms lowered to  $P_{2}$ , they will each sell the quantity  $Q_{2}^{\prime}$  at point  $B^{\prime}$  rather than their expected sales of  $Q_{2}$  at point  $B$ . At point  $B^{\prime}$ , the price charged is less than average costs, so every firm is incurring a loss. In the short-run equilibrium with trade, firms lower their prices, expecting to make profits at point  $B$ , but end up making losses at point  $B^{\prime}$ .

Point  $B'$  is not the long-run equilibrium because the losses will bankrupt some firms and cause them to exit from the industry. This exit will increase demand (both  $d$  and  $D / N^{A}$ ) for the remaining firms and decrease the number of product varieties available to consumers. To understand where the new long-run equilibrium occurs, we turn to a new diagram.

Long-Run Equilibrium with Trade Due to the exit of firms, the number of firms remaining in each country after trade is less than it was before trade. Let us call the number of firms in each country after trade is opened  $N^T$ , where  $N^T < N^A$ . This reduction in the number of firms increases the share of demand facing each one, so that  $D / N^T > D / N^A$ . In Figure 6-7, the demand  $D / N^T$  facing each firm lies to the right of the demand  $D / N^A$  in the earlier figures. We show the long-run equilibrium with trade at point  $C$ . At point  $C$ , the demand curve  $d_3$  facing an individual firm is tangent to the average cost curve  $AC$ . In addition, the marginal revenue curve  $mr_3$  intersects the marginal cost curve  $MC$ .

How does this long-run equilibrium compare to that without trade? First of all, despite the exit of some firms in each country, we still expect that the world number of products, which is  $2N^{T}$  (the number produced in each country  $N^T$  times two countries), exceeds the number of products  $N^A$  available in each country before trade,  $2N^{T} > N^{A}$ . It follows that the demand curve  $d_{3}$  facing each firm must be more elastic than demand  $d_{1}$  in the absence of trade: the availability of imported products makes consumers more price sensitive than they were before trade, so the demand curve  $d_{3}$  is more elastic than demand  $d_{1}$  in Figure 6-5. At free-trade equilibrium (point  $C$ ), each firm still in operation charges a lower price than it did with no trade,  $P^{W} < P^{A}$ , and produces a higher quantity,  $Q_{3} > Q_{1}$ . The drop in prices and increase in quantity for each firm go hand in hand: as the quantity produced by each surviving firm increases, average costs fall due to increasing returns to scale, and so do the prices charged by firms.

FIGURE 6-7

# Long-Run Monopolistic Competition

Equilibrium with Trade The long-run equilibrium with trade occurs at point  $C$ . At this point, profit is maximized for each firm producing  $Q_{3}$  (which satisfies  $mr_{3} = MC$ ) and charging price  $P^{W}$  (which equals  $AC$ ). Because monopoly profit is zero when price equals average cost, no firms enter or exit the industry. Compared with the long-run equilibrium without trade (Figure 6-5),  $d_{3}$  (along with  $mr_{3}$ ) has shifted out as domestic firms exited the industry and has become more elastic due to the greater total number of varieties with trade,  $2N^{T} > N^{A}$ . Compared with the long-run equilibrium without trade at point  $A$ , the trade equilibrium at point  $C$  has a lower price and higher sales by all surviving firms.

Gains from Trade The long-run equilibrium at point  $C$  has two sources of gains from trade for consumers. First, the price has fallen as compared with point  $A$ , so consumers benefit for that reason. A good way to think about this drop in the price is that it reflects increasing returns to scale, with average costs falling as the output of firms rises. The drop in average costs is a rise in productivity for these surviving firms because output can be produced more cheaply. So consumers gain from the drop in price, which is the result of the rise in productivity.

There is a second source of gains from trade to consumers. We assume that consumers obtain higher surplus when there are more product varieties available to buy, and hence the increase in variety is a source of gain for consumers. Within each country, some firms exit the market after trade begins, so fewer product varieties are produced by the remaining domestic firms. However, because consumers can buy products from both Home and Foreign firms, the total number of varieties available with trade is greater than the number of varieties available in any one country before trade,  $2N^{T} > N^{A}$ . Thus, in addition to the drop in prices, there is an added consumer gain from the availability of additional product varieties.

Adjustment Costs from Trade Against these long-run gains from trade, there are short-run adjustment costs as some firms in each country shut down and exit the industry. The workers in those firms will experience a spell of unemployment as they look for new jobs. Over the long run, however, we expect these workers to find new positions, so we view these costs as temporary. We do not build these adjustment costs into the model because they are short-term, but we are still interested in how large these costs might be in practice. To compare the short-run adjustment costs with the long-run gains from trade, we next look at the evidence from Canada, Mexico, and the United States under the North American Free Trade Agreement. We will see that the predictions of the monopolistic competition model hold reasonably well in each case.

# 3 The North American Free Trade Agreement

The idea that free trade will expand the range of products available to consumers is not new—it is even mentioned by David Ricardo in the quote at the beginning of this chapter. But the ability to carefully model the effects of trade under monopolistic competition is new and was developed in research during the 1980s by Professors Elhanan Helpman, Paul Krugman, and the late Kelvin Lancaster. That research was not just theoretical but was used to shed light on free-trade agreements, which guarantee free trade among a group of countries. In 1989, for example, Canada and the United States entered into a free-trade agreement, and in 1994 they were joined by Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The potential for Canadian firms to expand their output (and enjoy lower average costs) by selling in the United States and Mexico was a key factor in Canada's decision to enter into these free-trade agreements. The quote from the Canadian economist Daniel Trefler at the beginning of the chapter shows that there was indeed a rise in productivity in Canada because of the free-trade agreements. We use NAFTA to illustrate the gains and costs predicted by the monopolistic competition model.

# Gains and Adjustment Costs for Canada Under NAFTA

Studies in Canada dating back to the 1960s predicted substantial gains from free trade with the United States because Canadian firms would expand their scale of operations to serve the larger market and lower their costs. A set of simulations based on the monopolistic competition model performed by the Canadian economist Richard Harris in the mid-1980s influenced Canadian policy makers to proceed with the free-trade agreement with the United States in 1989. Enough time has passed since then to look back and see how Canada has fared under the trade agreements with the United States and Mexico.

Headlines: The Long and the Short of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement describes what happened in Canada. Using data from 1988 to 1996, Professor Daniel Trefler of the University of Toronto found short-run adjustment costs of 100,000 lost jobs, or  $5\%$  of manufacturing employment. Some industries that faced particularly large tariff cuts saw their employment fall by as much as  $15\%$ . These are very large declines in employment. Over time, however, these job losses were more than made up for by the creation of new jobs elsewhere in manufacturing, so there were no long-run job losses as a result of the free-trade agreement.

What about long-run gains? Trefler found a large positive effect on the productivity of firms, with productivity rising as much as  $18\%$  over eight years in the industries most affected by tariff cuts, or a compound growth rate of  $2.1\%$  per year. For manufacturing overall, productivity rose by  $6\%$ , for a compound growth rate of  $0.7\%$  per year. The difference between these two numbers, which is  $2.1 - 0.7 = 1.4\%$  per year, is an estimate of how free trade with the United States affected the Canadian industries most affected by the tariff cuts over and above the impact on other industries. The productivity growth in Canada allowed for a modest rise in real earnings of  $2.4\%$  over the eight-year period for production workers, or  $0.3\%$  per year. We conclude that the prediction of the monopolistic competition model that surviving firms increase their productivity is confirmed for Canadian manufacturing. Those productivity gains led to a fall in prices for consumers and a rise in real earnings for workers, which demonstrates the first source of the gains from trade. The second source of gains from trade—increased product variety for Canadian consumers—was not measured in the

# The Long and the Short of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement

University of Toronto Professor Daniel Trefler studied the short-run effect of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement on employment in Canada, and the long-run effect on productivity and wages.

There is good news and bad news in regard to the Canada/U.S. Free Trade Agreement. The good news is that the deal, especially controversial in Canada, has raised productivity in Canadian industry since it was implemented on January 1, 1989, benefiting both consumers and stakeholders in efficient plants. The bad news is that there were also substantial short-run adjustment costs for workers who lost their jobs and for stakeholders in plants that were closed because of new import competition or the opportunity to produce more cheaply in the south. "One cannot understand current debates about freer trade without understanding this conflict" between the costs and gains that flow from trade liberalization, notes Daniel Trefler in "The Long and Short of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement"

(NBER Working Paper No. 8293). His paper looks at the impact of the FTA on a large number of performance indicators in the Canadian manufacturing sector from 1989 to 1996. In the one-third of industries that experienced the largest tariff cuts in that period, ranging between 5 and 33 percent and averaging 10 percent, employment shrunk by 15 percent, output fell 11 percent, and the number of plants declined 8 percent. These industries include the makers of garments, footwear, upholstered furniture, coffins and caskets, fur goods, and adhesives. For manufacturing as a whole, the comparable numbers are 5, 3, and 4 percent, respectively, Trefler finds. "These numbers capture the large adjustment costs associated with reallocating resources out of protected, inefficient, low-end manufacturing," he notes.

Since 1996, manufacturing employment and output have largely rebounded in Canada. This suggests that some of the lost jobs and output were reallocated to high-end manufacturing. On the positive side, the tariff cuts boosted labor productivity (how much output is produced per hour of work) by a compounded annual rate of 2.1 percent for the most affected industries and by 0.6 percent for manufacturing as a whole, Trefler calculates… . Surprisingly, Trefler writes, the tariff cuts raised annual earnings slightly. Production workers' wages rose by 0.8 percent per year in the most affected industries and by 0.3 percent per year for manufacturing as a whole. The tariff cuts did not effect earnings of higher-paid non-production workers or weekly hours of production workers.

# Gains and Adjustment Costs for Mexico Under NAFTA

In the mid-1980s Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid embarked on a program of economic liberalization that included land reform and greater openness to foreign investment. Tariffs with the United States were as high as  $100\%$  on some goods, and there were many restrictions on the operations of foreign firms. De la Madrid believed that the economic reforms were needed to boost growth and incomes in Mexico. Joining NAFTA with the United States and Canada in 1994 was a way to ensure the permanence of the reforms already under way. Under NAFTA, Mexican tariffs on U.S. goods declined from an average of  $14\%$  in 1990 to  $1\%$  in 2001. In addition, U.S. tariffs on Mexican imports fell as well, though from levels that were much lower to begin with in most industries.

How did the fall in tariffs under NAFTA affect the Mexican economy? We will review the evidence on productivity and wages below, but first, you should read Headlines: NAFTA Turns 15, Bravo! This editorial was written in 2009, the fifteenth anniversary of the beginning of NAFTA, and appeared in a U.S.-based

# HEADLINES

# NAFTA Turns 15, Bravo!

This editorial discussed the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. and Mexican economies. It appeared in a U.S.-based pro-business publication focusing on Latin-American businesses.

As Americans and Mexicans celebrated the start of a new year yesterday, they had reason to celebrate another milestone as well: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) turned 15. Despite the slowdown in both the U.S. and Mexican economies, trade between the two nations was expected to set a new record last year. In the first half of 2008, U.S.-Mexico trade grew by 9.6 percent to  \$183.7 billion. That follows a record\$ 347 billion in trade in 2007. Compare that to the 81.5 billion in total two-way trade in 1993, the last year before NAFTA was implemented.

NAFTA has without a doubt been the primary reason for that success. It dramatically opened up Mexico's economy to U.S. goods and investments, helping boost revenues for many U.S. companies. At the same time, Mexican companies were able to get duty-free access to the world's largest market, resulting in more sales and more jobs there. The trade growth has meant benefits for both consumers and companies on each side of the border.

While China clearly dominates many of the products we buy in U.S. stores these days, Mexico also plays an important role. Mexico ranks third behind Canada and China among the top ex porters to the U.S. market. But Mexico beats China when it comes to buying U.S. goods. During the first ten months last year [2008], Mexico imported U.S. products worth \$129.4 billion—or more than twice the \$61.0 billion China (with a much larger economy) bought from us… .

NAFTA has benefited consumers in the U.S. through greater choice of products, in terms of selection, quality, and price, including many that are less expensive than pre-NAFTA… . NAFTA has allowed U.S. manufacturing giants from General Motors to General Electric to use economies of scale for their production lines. Prior to NAFTA, GM's assembly plants in Mexico assembled small volumes of many products, which resulted in high costs and somewhat inferior quality, says Mustafa Mohatarem, GM's chief economist. Now its plants in Mexico specialize in few high-volume products, resulting in low cost and high quality, he points out. The result benefits both U.S. and Mexican consumers…

To be sure, NAFTA is not perfect. For one, it didn't even touch on Mexico's sensitive oil sector, which should have been part of a comprehensive free trade agreement. Neither did it offer any teeth when it came to violations. For example, the shameful U.S. disregard for the NAFTA regulations on allowing Mexican trucks to enter the United States. Only in September last year [2008], as part of a pilot program by the Bush Administration, did the first Mexican trucks enter the United States—after a delay of eight years … thanks to opposition from U.S. unions and lawmakers… Many economists also are critical of NAFTA's labor and environmental side agreements, which President Bill Clinton negotiated in order to support the treaty.

However, all in all NAFTA has been of major benefit for both the United States and Mexico. Any renegotiation of NAFTA, as president-elect Barack Obama pledged during last year's campaign, would negatively harm both economies just as they now suffer from economic recession. It would also harm our relations with Mexico, our top trading partner in Latin America. Hopefully, pragmatism will win the day in Washington, D.C. this year, as our new president aims to find a way to get the U.S. economy back on track. Leaving NAFTA alone would be a good start.

In the meantime, we congratulate NAFTA on its 15 years. Feliz Cumpleanos.

pro-business publication focusing on Latin-American businesses. It makes a number of arguments in favor of NAFTA that we have also discussed, including increasing returns to scale and product variety for consumers. But it also points out some defects of NAFTA, including the tardiness of the United States in allowing an open border for trucks from Mexico, and the environmental and labor side agreements (discussed in a later chapter). Even after 15 years, Mexican trucks were not permitted into the United States, and this fact led Mexico to retaliate by imposing tariffs on some U.S. goods. Two years later, in 2011, the United States finally agreed to allow Mexican trucks to cross the border to deliver goods. In Headlines: Nearly 20 Years After NAFTA, First Mexican Truck Arrives In U.S. Interior, we describe this milestone in the economic relations between the United States and Mexico.

Productivity in Mexico As we did for Canada, let us investigate the impact of NAFTA on productivity in Mexico. In panel (a) of Figure 6-8, we show the growth in labor productivity for two types of manufacturing firms: the maquiladora plants, which are close to the border and produce almost exclusively for export to the United States, and all other nonmaquiladora manufacturing plants in Mexico.

# Nearly 20 Years After NAFTA, First Mexican Truck Arrives In U.S. Interior

On October 21, 2011, the first big-rig truck from Mexico crossed the border into Laredo, Texas, under a trucking program that was agreed to in NAFTA but that took 17 years to implement.

Nearly two decades after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the first Mexican truck ventured into the U.S. under provisions of the controversial treaty. With little fanfare, a white tractor-trailer with Mexican license plates entered the courtyard of the Atlas Copco facility in Garland, Texas on Saturday afternoon to unload a Mexico-manufactured metal structure for drilling oil wells.

The delivery marked the first time that a truck from Mexico reached the U.S. interior under the 17-year-old trade agreement, which was supposed to give trucks from the neighboring countries access to highways on both sides of the border. The Obama administration signed an agreement with Mexico to end the long dispute over the NAFTA provision in July that also removes 2 billion in duties on American goods. "We were prepared for this a long time ago because we met the requirements and complied with the rules of cross-border transportation, which made us earn the trust of

In panel (b), we also show what happened to real wages and real incomes.

For the maquiladora plants in panel (a), productivity rose  $45\%$  from 1994 (when Mexico joined NAFTA) to 2003, a compound growth rate of  $4.1\%$  per year for more than nine years. For the non-maquiladora plants, productivity rose overall by  $25\%$  from 1994 to 2003,  $2.5\%$  per year. The difference between these two numbers, which is  $1.6\%$  per year, is an estimate of the impact of NAFTA on the productivity of the maquiladora plants over and above the increase in productivity that occurred in the rest of Mexico.

Real Wages and Incomes Real wages in the maquiladora and non-maquiladora plants are shown in panel (b) of Figure 6-8. From 1994 to 1997, there was a fall of more than  $20\%$  in real wages in both sectors, despite a rise in productivity in the non-maquiladora sector. This fall in real wages is not what we expect from the monopolistic competition model, so why did it occur?

Shortly after Mexico joined NAFTA, it suffered a financial crisis that led to a large devaluation of the peso. It would be incorrect to attribute the peso crisis to Mexico's joining NAFTA, even though both events occurred the same year. Prior to 1994 Mexico followed a fixed exchange-rate policy, but in late 1994 it switched to a flexible exchange-rate regime instead, and the peso devalued to much less than its former fixed value. Details about exchange-rate regimes and the reasons for switching from

Labor Productivity and Wages in Mexico Panel (a) shows labor productivity for workers in the maquiladora Mexican manufacturing plants and for workers in non-maquiladora plants in the rest of Mexico. Panel (b) shows wages and monthly income for workers in maquiladora and non-maquiladora plants. Productivity and real monthly income grew faster in the maquiladora plants because of increased trade with the United States.

a fixed to flexible exchange rate are covered in international macroeconomics. For now, the key idea is that when the peso's value falls, it becomes more expensive for Mexico to import goods from the United States because the peso price of imports goes up. The Mexican consumer price index also goes up, and as a result, real wages for Mexican workers fall.

The maquiladora sector, located beside the U.S. border, was more susceptible to the exchange-rate change and did not experience much of a gain in productivity over that period because of the increased cost of inputs imported from the United States. Workers in both the maquiladora and non-maquiladora sectors had to pay higher prices for imported goods, which is reflected in higher Mexican consumer prices. So the decline in real wages for workers in both sectors is similar. This decline was short-lived, however, and real wages in both sectors began to rise again in 1998. By 2003 real wages in both sectors had risen to nearly equal their value in 1994. This means that workers in Mexico did not gain or lose because of NAFTA on average: the productivity gains were not shared with workers, which is a disappointing finding, but real wages at least recovered from the effects of the peso crisis.

The picture is somewhat better if instead of real wages, we look at real monthly income, which includes higher-income employees who earn salaries rather than wages. In panel (b), for the non-maquiladora sector, the data on real wages and real monthly income move together closely. But in the maquiladora sector, real monthly incomes were indeed higher in 2003 than in 1994, indicating some gains for workers in the manufacturing plants most affected by NAFTA. This conclusion is reinforced by other evidence from Mexico, which shows that higher-income workers fared better than unskilled workers in the maquiladora sector and better than workers in the rest of Mexico. From this evidence, the higher-income workers in the maquiladora sector gained most from NAFTA in the long run.

Adjustment Costs in Mexico When Mexico joined NAFTA, it was expected that the short-run adjustment costs would fall especially hard on the agricultural sector in Mexico, such as the corn industry, because it would face strong import competition from the United States. For that reason, the tariff reductions in agriculture were phased in over 15 years. The evidence to date suggests that the farmers growing corn in Mexico did not suffer as much as was feared. There were several reasons for this outcome. First, the poorest farmers do not sell the corn they grow but consume it themselves and buy any extra corn they need. These farmers benefited from cheaper import prices for corn from the United States. Second, the Mexican government was able to use subsidies to offset the reduction in income for other corn farmers. Surprisingly, the total production of corn in Mexico rose following NAFTA instead of falling.

Turning to the manufacturing sector, we should again distinguish the maquiladora and non-maquiladora plants. For the maquiladora plants, employment grew rapidly following NAFTA, from 584,000 workers in 1994 to a peak of 1.29 million workers in

2000. After that, however, the maquiladora sector entered a downturn, due to several factors: the United States entered a recession, reducing demand for Mexican exports; China was competing for U.S. sales by exporting products similar to those sold by Mexico; and the Mexican peso became overvalued, making it difficult to export abroad. For all these reasons, employment in the maquiladora sector fell after 2000, to 1.1 million workers in 2003. It is not clear whether we should count this decline in employment as a short-run adjustment cost due to NAFTA, nor is it clear how long it will take the maquiladora sector to recover. What is apparent is that the maquiladora sector faces increasing international competition (not all due to NAFTA), which can be expected to raise the volatility of its output and employment, and that volatility can be counted as a cost of international trade for workers who are displaced.

# Gains and Adjustment Costs for the United States Under NAFTA

Studies on the effects of NAFTA on the United States have not estimated its effects on the productivity of American firms, perhaps because Canada and Mexico are only two of many export markets for the United States, and it would be hard to identify the impact of their tariff reductions. Instead, to measure the long-run gains from NAFTA and other trade agreements, researchers have estimated the second source of gains from trade: the expansion of import varieties available to consumers. For the United States, we will compare the long-run gains to consumers from expanded product varieties with the short-run adjustment costs from exiting firms and unemployment.

Expansion of Variety to the United States To understand how NAFTA affected the range of products available to American consumers, Table 6-3 shows the variety of goods Mexico exported to the United States in 1990 and 2001. To interpret these numbers, start with the 1990 export variety in agriculture of  $42\%$ . That figure means that  $42\%$  of all the agricultural products the United States imported in 1990, from any country, also came from Mexico. For instance, avocados, bananas, cucumbers, and tomatoes imported from various Central or South American countries were also imported to the United States from Mexico. Measuring the variety of products Mexico exported to the United States does not take into account the amount that Mexico sells of each product; rather, it counts the number of different types of products Mexico

Mexico's Export Variety to the United States, 1990-2001 This table shows the extent of variety in Mexican exports to the United States, by industry. From 1990 to 2001, export variety grew in every industry, as U.S. tariffs were reduced due to NAFTA. All figures are percentages.

From 1990 to 2001, the range of agricultural products that Mexico exported to the United States expanded from 42 to  $51\%$ . That compound growth rate of  $1.9\%$  per year is close to the average annual growth rate for export variety in all industries shown in the last column of Table 6-3, which is  $2.2\%$  per year. Export variety grew at a faster rate in the wood and paper industry (with a compound growth rate of  $2.6\%$  per year), petroleum and plastics ( $2.5\%$  growth), and electronics ( $4.6\%$  growth). The industries in which there has traditionally been a lot of trade between the United States and Mexico—such as machinery and transport (including autos) and textiles and garments—have slower growth in export variety because Mexico was exporting a wide range of products in these industries to the United States even before joining NAFTA.

The increase in the variety of products exported from Mexico to the United States under NAFTA is a source of gains from trade for American consumers. The United States has also imported more product varieties over time from many other countries, too, especially developing countries. According to one estimate, the total number of product varieties imported into the United States from 1972 to 2001 has increased by four times. Furthermore, that expansion in import variety has had the same beneficial impact on consumers as a reduction in import prices of  $1.2\%$  per year.[10] That equivalent price reduction is a measure of the gains from trade due to the expansion of varieties exported to the United States from all countries.

Unfortunately, we do not have a separate estimate of the gains from the growth of export varieties from Mexico alone, which averages  $2.2\%$  per year from Table 6-3. Suppose we use the same  $1.2\%$  price reduction estimate for Mexico that has been found for all countries. That is, we assume that the growth in export variety from Mexico leads to the same beneficial impact on U.S. consumers as a reduction in Mexican import prices of  $1.2\%$  per year, or about one-half as much as the growth in export variety itself. In 1994, the first year of NAFTA, Mexico exported  \$50 billion in merchandise goods to the United States and by 2001 this sum had grown to\$ 131 billion. Using \$90 billion as an average of these two values, a  $1.2\%$  reduction in the prices for Mexican imports would save U.S. consumers \$90 billion  $\cdot 1.2\% =$ 1.1 billion per year. We will assume that all these savings are due to NAFTA, though even without NAFTA, there would likely have been some growth in export variety from Mexico.

It is crucial to realize that these consumer savings are permanent and that they increase over time as export varieties from Mexico continue to grow. Thus, in the first year of NAFTA, we estimate a gain to U.S. consumers of  \$1.1 billion; in the second year a gain of\$ 2.2 billion, equivalent to a total fall in prices of 2.4\%; in the third year a gain of \$3.3 billion; and so on. Adding these up over the first nine years of NAFTA, the total benefit to consumers was \$49.5 billion, or an average of \$5.5 billion per year. In 2003, the tenth year of NAFTA, consumers would gain by \$11 billion as compared with 1994. This gain will continue to grow as Mexico further increases the range of varieties exported to the United States.

Adjustment Costs in the United States Adjustment costs in the United States come as firms exit the market because of import competition and the workers employed by those firms are temporarily unemployed. One way to measure that temporary unemployment is to look at the claims under the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) provisions. The TAA program offers assistance to workers in manufacturing who lose their jobs because of import competition. As we discussed in Chapter 3, the North American Free Trade Agreement included a special extension of TAA to workers laid off due to import competition because of NAFTA.

By looking at claims under that program, we can get an idea of the unemployment caused by NAFTA, one of the short-run costs of the agreement. From 1994 to 2002, some 525,000 workers, or about 58,000 per year, lost their jobs and were certified as adversely affected by trade or investment with Canada or Mexico under the NAFTA-TAA program.[11] As a result, these workers were entitled to additional unemployment benefits. This number is probably the most accurate estimate we have of the temporary unemployment caused by NAFTA.

How large is the displacement of 58,000 workers per year due to NAFTA? We can compare this number with overall job displacement in the United States. Over the three years from January 1999 to December 2001, 4 million workers were displaced, about one-third of whom were in manufacturing. So the annual number of workers displaced in manufacturing was 4 million  $\cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 444,000$  workers per year. Thus, the NAFTA layoffs of 58,000 workers were about  $13\%$  of the total displacement in manufacturing, which is a substantial amount.

Rather than compare the displacement caused by NAFTA with the total displacement in manufacturing, however, we can instead evaluate the wages lost by displaced workers and compare this amount with the consumer gains. In Chapter 3 (see Application: Manufacturing and Services), we learned that about  $56\%$  of workers laid off in manufacturing during the 2009-2011 period were reemployed within three years (by January 2012). That estimate of the fraction of workers reemployed within three years has been somewhat higher— $66\%$ —during earlier recessions. Some workers are reemployed in less than three years; for some, it takes longer. To simplify the problem, suppose that the average length of unemployment for laid-off workers is three years.[12] Average yearly earnings for production workers in manufacturing were  \$31,000 in 2000, so each displaced worker lost\$ 93,000 in wages (three times the workers' average annual income).[13] Total lost wages caused by displacement would be 58,000 workers displaced per year times \$93,000, or \$5.4 billion per year during the first nine years of NAFTA.

These private costs of  \$5.4 billion are nearly equal to the average welfare gains of\$ 5.5 billion per year due to the expansion of import varieties from Mexico from 1994 to 2002, as computed previously. But the gains from increased product variety continue and grow over time as new imported products become available to American consumers. Recall from the previous calculation that the gains from the ongoing expansion of product varieties from Mexico were  \$11 billion in 2003, the tenth year of NAFTA, or twice as high as the\$ 5.4 billion costs of adjustment. As the consumer gains continue to grow, adjustment costs due to job losses fall. Thus, the consumer gains from increased variety, when summed over years, considerably exceed the private losses from displacement. This outcome is guaranteed to occur because the gains from expanded import varieties occur every year that the imports are available, whereas labor displacement is a temporary phenomenon.

The calculation we have made shows that the gains to U.S. consumers from greater import variety from Mexico, when summed over time, are more than the private costs of adjustment. In practice, the actual compensation received by workers is much less than their costs of adjustment. In 2002 the NAFTA-TAA program was consolidated with the general TAA program in the United States, so there is no further record of layoffs as a result of NAFTA. Under the Trade Act of 2002, the funding for TAA was increased from  \$400 million to\$ 1.2 billion per year and some other improvements to the program were made, such as providing a health-care subsidy for laid-off workers. In addition, as part of the jobs stimulus bill signed by President Obama on February 17, 2009, workers in the service sector (as well as farmers) who lose their jobs due to trade can now also apply for TAA benefits, as was discussed in Chapter 3. It would be desirable to continue to expand the TAA program to include more workers who face layoffs due to increased global competition.

Summary of NAFTA In this section, we have been able to measure, at least in part, the long-run gains and short-run costs from NAFTA for Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The monopolistic competition model indicates two sources of gains from trade: the rise in productivity due to expanded output by surviving firms, which leads to lower prices, and the expansion in the overall number of varieties of products available to consumers with trade, despite the exit of some firms in each country. For Mexico and Canada, we measured the long-run gains by the improvement in productivity for exporters as compared with other manufacturing firms. For the United States, we measured the long-run gains using the expansion of varieties from Mexico, and the equivalent drop in price faced by U.S. consumers. It is clear that for Canada and the United States, the long-run gains considerably exceed the short-run costs. The picture is less optimistic for Mexico because the gains have not been reflected in the growth of real wages for production workers (due in part to the peso crisis). The real earnings of higher-income workers in the maquiladora sector have risen, however, so they have been the principal beneficiaries of NAFTA so far.

# 4 Intra-Industry Trade and the Gravity Equation

In the monopolistic competition model, countries both import and export different varieties of differentiated goods. This result differs from the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models that we studied in Chapters 2 and 4: in those models, countries either export or import a good but do not export and import the same good simultaneously. Under monopolistic competition, countries will specialize in producing different varieties of a differentiated good and will trade those varieties back and forth. As we saw from the example of golf clubs at the beginning of the chapter, this is a common trade pattern that we call intra-industry trade.

# Index of Intra-Industry Trade

To develop the idea of intra-industry trade, consider the U.S. imports and exports of the goods shown in Table 6-4. In 2012 the United States imported  \$1,731 million in vaccines and exported\$ 2,514 million. When the amounts of imports and exports are similar for a good, as they are for vaccines, it is an indication that much of the trade in that good is intra-industry trade. The index of intra-industry trade tells us what proportion of trade in each product involves both imports and exports: a high index (up to 100\%) indicates that an equal amount of the good is imported and exported, whereas a low index (0\%) indicates that the good is either imported or exported but not both.

The formula for the index of intra-industry trade is

$$
(\text {I n d e x o f i n t r a - i n d u s t r y t r a d e}) = \frac {\text {M i n i m u m o f i m p o r t s a n d e x p o r t s}}{\frac {1}{2} (\text {I m p o r t s} + \text {e x p o r t s})}
$$

For vaccines, the minimum of imports and exports is  $1,731 million, and the average of imports and exports is \frac{1}{2} (1,731 + 2,514) = \$ 2,123$ million. So  $\frac{1731}{2123} = 82\%$  of the U.S. trade in vaccines is intra-industry trade; that is, it involves both exporting and importing of vaccines.

In Table 6-4, we show some other examples of intra-industry trade in other products for the United States. In addition to vaccines, products such as whiskey and frozen orange juice have a high index of intra-industry trade. These are all examples of highly differentiated products: for vaccines and whiskey, each exporting country sells products that are different from those of other exporting countries, including the United States. Even frozen orange juice is a differentiated product, once we realize that it is imported and exported in different months of the year. So it is not surprising

# TABLE 6-4

Index of Intra-Industry Trade for the United States, 2012 Shown here are value of imports, value of exports, and the index of intra-industry trade for a number of products. When the value of imports is similar to the value of exports, such as for vaccines, whiskey, and frozen orange juice, then the index of intra-industry trade is highest, and when a product is mainly imported or exported (but not both), then the index of intra-industry trade is lowest.

On the other hand, products such as men's shorts, large passenger aircraft, telephones, and golf carts have a low index of intra-industry trade. These goods are either mainly imported into the United States (like men's shorts and telephones) or mainly exported (like large passenger aircraft and golf carts). Even though these goods are still differentiated, we can think of them as being closer to fitting the Ricardian or Heckscher-Ohlin model, in which trade is determined by comparative advantage, such as having lower relative costs in one country because of technology or resource abundance. To obtain a high index of intra-industry trade, it is necessary for the good to be differentiated and for costs to be similar in the Home and Foreign countries, leading to both imports and exports.

# The Gravity Equation

The index of intra-industry trade measures the degree of intra-industry trade for a product but does not tell us anything about the total amount of trade. To explain the value of trade, we need a different equation, called the "gravity equation." This equation was given its name by a Dutch economist and Nobel laureate, Jan Tinbergen. Tinbergen was trained in physics, so he thought about the trade between countries as similar to the force of gravity between objects: Newton's universal law of gravitation states that objects with larger mass, or that are closer to each other, have a greater gravitational pull between them. Tinbergen's gravity equation for trade states that countries with larger GDPs, or that are closer to each other, have more trade between them. Both these equations can be explained simply—even if you have never studied physics, you will be able to grasp their meanings. The point is that just as the force of gravity is strongest between two large objects, the monopolistic competition model predicts that large countries (as measured by their GDP) should trade the most with one another. There is much empirical evidence to support this prediction, as we will show.

Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation Suppose that two objects each have mass  $M_{1}$  and  $M_{2}$  and are located distance  $d$  apart. According to Newton's universal law of gravitation, the force of gravity  $F_{g}$  between these two objects is

$$
F _ {g} = G \cdot \frac {M _ {1} \cdot M _ {2}}{d ^ {2}}
$$ where  $G$  is a constant that tells us the magnitude of this relationship. The larger each object is, or the closer they are to each other, the greater is the force of gravity between them.


The Gravity Equation in Trade The equation proposed by Tinbergen to explain trade between countries is similar to Newton's law of gravity, except that instead of the mass of two objects, we use the GDP of two countries, and instead of predicting the force of gravity, we are predicting the amount of trade between them. The gravity equation in trade is

$$

\text {T r a d e} = B \cdot \frac {G D P _ {1} \cdot G D P _ {2}}{d i s t ^ {n}}

$$ where Trade is the amount of trade (measured by imports, exports, or their average) between two countries,  $GDP_{1}$  and  $GDP_{2}$  are their gross domestic products, and  $dist$  is the distance between them. Notice that we use the exponent  $n$  on distance,  $dist^{n}$ , rather than  $dist^{2}$  as in Newton's law of gravity, because we are not sure of the precise relationship between distance and trade. The term  $B$  in front of the gravity equation is a constant that

indicates the relationship between the "gravity term" (i.e.,  $GDP_{1} \cdot GDP_{2} / dist^{n}$ ) and Trade. It can also be interpreted as summarizing the effects of all factors (other than size and distance) that influence the amount of trade between two countries; such factors include tariffs (which would lower the amount of trade and reduce  $B$ ), sharing a common border (which would increase trade and raise  $B$ ), and so on.

According to the gravity equation, the larger the countries are (as measured by their GDP), or the closer they are to each other, the greater is the amount of trade between them. This connection among economic size, distance, and trade is an implication of the monopolistic competition model that we have studied in this chapter. The monopolistic competition model implies that larger countries trade the most for two reasons: larger countries export more because they produce more product varieties, and they import more because their demand is higher. Therefore, larger countries trade more in both exports and imports.

Deriving the Gravity Equation To explain more carefully why the gravity equation holds in the monopolistic competition model, we can work through some algebra using the GDPs of the various countries. Start with the GDP of Country 1,  $GDP_{1}$ . Each of the goods produced in Country 1 is a differentiated product, so they are different from the varieties produced in other countries. Every other country will demand the goods of Country 1 (because they are different from their home-produced goods), and the amount of their demand will depend on two factors: (1) the relative size of the importing country (larger countries demand more) and (2) the distance between the two countries (being farther away leads to higher transportation costs and less trade).

To measure the relative size of each importing country, we use its share of world GDP. Specifically, we define Country 2's share of world GDP as  $\text{Share}_2 = \frac{\text{GDP}_2}{\text{GDP}_W}$ . To measure the transportation costs involved in trade, we use distance raised to a power, or  $\text{dist}^n$ . Using these definitions, exports from Country 1 to Country 2 will equal the goods available in Country 1 ( $\text{GDP}_1$ ), times the relative size of Country 2 ( $\text{Share}_2$ ), divided by the transportation costs between them ( $\text{dist}^n$ ), so that

$$
\operatorname {T r a d e} = \frac {G D P _ {1} \cdot S h a r e _ {2}}{d i s t ^ {n}} = \left(\frac {1}{G D P _ {W}}\right) \frac {G D P _ {1} \cdot G D P _ {2}}{d i s t ^ {n}}
$$

This equation for the trade between Countries 1 and 2 looks similar to the gravity equation, especially if we think of the term  $(1 / GDP_{W})$  as the constant term  $B$ . We see from this equation that the trade between two countries will be proportional to their relative sizes, measured by the product of their GDPs (the greater the size of the countries, the larger is trade), and inversely proportional to the distance between them (the smaller the distance, the larger is trade). The following application explores how well the gravity equation works in practice.

# APPLICATION

# The Gravity Equation for Canada and the United States

We can apply the gravity equation to trade between any pair of countries, or even to trade between the provinces or states of one country and another. Panel (a) of Figure 6-9 shows data collected on the value of trade between Canadian provinces and U.S. states in 1993. On the horizontal axis, we show the gravity term:

$$
\text {G r a v i t y} = \frac {G D P _ {1} \cdot G D P _ {2}}{d i s t ^ {1 . 2 5}}
$$ where  $GDP_{1}$  is the gross domestic product of a U.S. state (in billions of U.S. dollars),  $GDP_{2}$  is the gross domestic product of a Canadian province (in billions of U.S. dollars), and  $dist$  is the distance between them (in miles). We use the exponent 1.25 on the distance term because it has been shown in other research studies to describe the relationship between distance and trade value quite well. The horizontal axis is

# Gravity Equation for the United States and

Canada, 1993 Plotted in these figures are the dollar value of exports in 1993 and the gravity term (plotted in log scale). Panel (a) shows these variables for trade between 10 Canadian provinces and 30 U.S. states. When the gravity term is 1, for example, the amount of trade between a province and state is 93 million. Panel (b) shows these variables for trade between 10 Canadian provinces. When the gravity term is 1, the amount of trade between the provinces is 1.3 billion, 14 times larger than between a province and a state. These graphs illustrate two important points: there is a positive relationship between country size (as measured by GDP) and trade volume, and there is much more trade within Canada than between Canada and the United States.

plotted as a logarithmic scale, with values from 0.001 to 100. A higher value along the horizontal axis indicates either a large GDP for the trading province and state or a smaller distance between them.

The vertical axis in Figure 6-9 shows the 1993 value of exports (in millions of U.S. dollars) between a Canadian province and U.S. state or between a U.S. state and Canadian province; this is the value of trade for the province-state pair. That axis is also plotted as a logarithmic scale, with values from  \$0.001 million (or$ 1,000) to $100,000 million (or \$100 billion) in trade. There are 30 states and 10 provinces included in the study, so there are a total of 600 possible trade flows between them (though some of those flows are zero, indicating that no exporting takes place). Each of the points in panel (a) represents the trade flow and gravity term between one state and one province.

We can see from the set of points in panel (a) that states and provinces with a higher gravity term between them (measured on the horizontal axis) also tend to have more trade (measured on the vertical axis). That strong, positive relationship shown by the set of points in panel (a) demonstrates that the gravity equation holds well empirically. Panel (a) also shows the "best fit" straight line through the set of points, which has the following equation:

$$

\text {T r a d e} = 9 3 \frac {G D P _ {1} \cdot G D P _ {2}}{d i s t ^ {1 . 2 5}}

$$

The constant term  $B = 93$  gives the best fit to this gravity equation for Canadian provinces and U.S. states. When the gravity term equals 1, as illustrated in panel (a), then the predicted amount of trade between that state and province is  \$93 million. The closest example to this point is Alberta and New Jersey. In 1993 there were\$ 94 million in exports from Alberta to New Jersey and they had a gravity term of approximately 1.

Trade Within Canada Because the gravity equation works well at predicting international trade between provinces and states in different countries, it should also work well at predicting trade within a country, or intra-national trade. To explore this idea, panel (b) of Figure 6-9 graphs the value of exports (in millions of U.S. dollars) between any two Canadian provinces, along with the gravity term for those provinces. The scale of the axes in panel (b) is the same as in panel (a). From panel (b), we again see that there is a strong, positive relationship between the gravity term between two provinces (measured on the horizontal axis) and their trade (measured on the vertical axis). The "best fit" straight line through the set of points has the following equation:

$$

\text {T r a d e} = 1, 3 0 0 \cdot \frac {G D P _ {1} \cdot G D P _ {2}}{d i s t ^ {1 . 2 5}}

$$

That is, the constant term  $B = 1,300$  gives the best fit to this gravity equation for Canadian provinces. When the gravity term equals 1, as illustrated in panel (b), then the predicted amount of trade between two provinces is  \$1,300 million, or\$ 1.3 billion. The closest example to this combination is between British Columbia and Alberta: in 1993 their gravity term was approximately 1.3 and British Columbia exported 1.4 billion of goods to Alberta.

Comparing the gravity equation for international trade between Canada and the United States with the gravity equation for intra-national trade in Canada, the constant term for Canadian trade is much bigger—1,300 as compared with 93. Taking the ratio of these two constant terms  $(1,300 / 93 = 14)$ , we find that on average there is 14 times more trade within Canada than occurs across the border! That number is even higher if we consider an earlier year, 1988, just before Canada and the United States signed the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement in 1989. In 1988 intra-national trade within Canada was 22 times higher than international trade between Canada and the United States.[14] Even though that ratio fell from 1988 to 1993 because of the free-trade agreement between Canada and the United States, it is still remarkable that there is so much more trade within Canada than across the border, or more generally, so much more intra-national than international trade.


The finding that trade across borders is less than trade within countries reflects all the barriers to trade that occur between countries. Factors that make it easier or more difficult to trade goods between countries are often called border effects, and they include the following:

Taxes imposed when imported goods enter into a country, tariffs
Limits on the number of items allowed to cross the border, quotas
- Other administrative rules and regulations affecting trade, including the time required for goods to clear customs
Geographic factors such as whether the countries share a border
Cultural factors such as whether the countries have a common language that might make trade easier

In the gravity equation, all the factors that influence the amount of trade are reflected in the constant  $B$ . As we have seen, the value of this constant differs for trade within a country versus trade between countries. In later chapters, we explore in detail the consequences of tariffs, quotas, and other barriers to trade. The lesson from the gravity equation is that such barriers to trade can potentially have a large impact on the amount of international trade as compared with intra-national trade.

# 5 Conclusions

When firms have differentiated products and increasing returns to scale, the potential exists for gains from trade above and beyond those that we studied in earlier chapters under perfect competition. We have demonstrated these additional gains using a model of monopolistic competition. In this model, trade will occur even between countries that are identical because the potential to sell in a larger market will induce firms to lower their prices below those charged in the absence of trade. When all firms lower their prices, however, some firms are no longer profitable and exit the market. The remaining firms expand their output, lowering their average costs through increasing returns to scale. The reduction in average costs lowers the prices charged by firms, creating gains for consumers in the importing country. In addition, because each firm produces a differentiated product, trade between countries allows for the importing of product varieties that are different from those produced domestically, creating a second source of gains for consumers.

When some firms have to exit the market, short-run adjustment costs arise within this model because of worker displacement. Using examples from Canada, Mexico, and the United States, we have argued that the short-run adjustment costs are less than the long-run gains. Regional trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are a good application of the monopolistic competition model. Another application is the "gravity equation," which states that countries that are larger or closer to one another will trade more. That prediction is supported by looking at data on trade between countries. Research has also shown that trade within countries is even larger than trade between countries.

# KEY POINTS

1. The monopolistic competition model assumes differentiated products, many firms, and increasing returns to scale. Firms enter whenever there are profits to be earned, so profits are zero in the long-run equilibrium.
2. When trade opens between two countries, the demand curve faced by each firm becomes more elastic, as consumers have more choices and become more price sensitive. Firms then lower their prices in an attempt to capture consumers from their competitors and obtain profits. When all firms do so, however, some firms incur losses and are forced to leave the market.
3. Introducing international trade under monopolistic competition leads to additional gains from trade for two reasons: (i) lower prices as firms expand their output and lower their average costs and (ii) additional imported product varieties available to consumers. There are also short-run adjustment costs, such as unemployment, as some firms exit the market.


4. The assumption of differentiated goods helps us to understand why countries often import and export varieties of the same type of good. That outcome occurs with the model of monopolistic competition.
5. The gravity equation states that countries with higher GDP, or that are close, will trade more. In addition, research has shown that there is more trade within countries than between countries.

# PROBLEMS

1. Explain how increasing returns to scale in production can be a basis for trade.
2. Why is trade within a country greater than trade between countries?

3. Starting from the long-run equilibrium without trade in the monopolistic competition model, as illustrated in Figure 6-5, consider what happens when the Home country begins trading with two other identical countries. Because the countries are all the same, the number of consumers in the world is three times larger than in a single country, and the number of firms in the world is three times larger than in a single country.


a. Compared with the no-trade equilibrium, how much does industry demand  $D$  increase? How much does the number of firms (or product varieties) increase? Does the demand curve  $D / \mathcal{N}^A$  still apply after the opening of trade? Explain why or why not.
b. Does the  $d_{1}$  curve shift or pivot due to the opening of trade? Explain why or why not.
c. Compare your answer to (b) with the case in which Home trades with only one other identical country. Specifically, compare the elasticity of the demand curve  $d_{1}$  in the two cases.
d. Illustrate the long-run equilibrium with trade, and compare it with the long-run equilibrium when Home trades with only one other identical country.

4. Starting from the long-run trade equilibrium in the monopolistic competition model, as illustrated in Figure 6-7, consider what happens when industry demand  $D$  increases. For instance, suppose that this is the market for cars, and lower gasoline prices generate higher demand  $D$ .

a. Redraw Figure 6-7 for the Home market and show the shift in the  $D / N^T$  curve and the new short-run equilibrium.
b. From the new short-run equilibrium, is there exit or entry of firms, and why?
c. Describe where the new long-run equilibrium occurs, and explain what has happened to the number of firms and the prices they charge.

5. Our derivation of the gravity equation from the monopolistic competition model used the following logic:

(i) Each country produces many products.
(ii) Each country demands all of the products that every other country produces.
(iii) Thus, large countries demand more imports from other countries.

The gravity equation relationship does not hold in the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Explain how the logic of the gravity equation breaks down in the Heckscher-Ohlin model; that is, which of the statements just listed is no longer true in the Heckscher-Ohlin model?

6. The United States, France, and Italy are among the world's largest producers. To answer the following questions, assume that their markets are monopolistically competitive, and use the gravity equation with  $B = 93$  and  $n = 1.25$ .

<table><tr><td></td><td>GDP in 2012 ($ billions)</td><td>Distance from the United States (miles)</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>2,776</td><td>5,544</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>2,196</td><td>6,229</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>14,991</td><td>—</td></tr></table> a. Using the gravity equation, compare the expected level of trade between the United States and France and between the United States and Italy.

b. The distance between Paris and Rome is 694 miles. Would you expect more French trade with Italy or with the United States? Explain what variable (i.e., country size or distance) drives your result.

7. What evidence is there that Canada is better off under the free-trade agreement with the United States?

8. In the section "Gains and Adjustment Costs for the United States Under NAFTA," we calculated the lost wages of workers displaced because of NAFTA. Prior experience in the manufacturing sector shows that about two-thirds of these workers obtain new jobs within three years. One way to think about that reemployment process is that one-third of workers find jobs in the first year, and another one-third of remaining unemployed workers find a job each subsequent year. Using this approach, in the table that follows, we show that one-third of workers get a job in the first year (column 2), leaving two-thirds of workers unemployed (column 4). In the second year, another  $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{9}$  of workers get a job (column 2), so that  $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{9} = \frac{5}{9}$  of the workers are employed (column 3). That leaves  $1 - \frac{5}{9} = \frac{4}{9}$  of the workers unemployed (column 4) at the end of the second year.

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Fraction Finding Job</td><td>Total Fraction Employed</td><td>Total Fraction Unemployed</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1/3</td><td>1/3</td><td>1 - 1/3 = 2/3</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1/3 • 2/3 = 2/9</td><td>1/3 + 2/9 = 5/9</td><td>1 - 5/9 = 4/9</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1/3 • 4/9 = 4/27</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1/3 • (2/3)Year-1</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table> a. Fill in two more rows of the table using the same approach as for the first two rows.

b. Notice that the fraction of workers finding a job each year (column 2) has the formula

Fraction finding job  $= \frac{1}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{\text{Year-1}}$

Using this formula, fill in six more values for the fraction of workers finding a job (column 2), up to year 10.

c. To calculate the average spell of unemployment, we take the fraction of workers finding jobs (column 2), multiply it by the years of unemployment (column 1), and add up the result over all the rows. By adding up over 10 rows, calculate what the average spell of unemployment is. What do you expect to get when adding up over 20 rows?

d. Compare your answer to (c) with the average three-year spell of unemployment on page 186. Was that number accurate?

9. a. Of two products, rice and paintings, which product do you expect to have a higher index of intra-industry trade? Why?
b. Access the U.S. TradeStats Express website at http://tse.export.gov/. Click on "National Trade Data" and then "Global Patterns of U.S. Merchandise Trade." Under the "Product" section, change the item to rice (HS 1006) and obtain the export and import values. Do the same for paintings (HS 9701); then calculate the intra-industry trade index for rice and paintings in 2012. Do your calculations confirm your expectation from part (a)? If your answers did not confirm your expectation, explain.
