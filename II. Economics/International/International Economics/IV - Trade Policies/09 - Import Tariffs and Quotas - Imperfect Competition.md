# Import Tariffs and Quotas Under Imperfect Competition

We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration—and it's made a difference… . But we need to do more… . Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.

President Barack Obama, State of the Union Address, January 24, 2012

If the case of heavyweight motorcycles is to be considered the only successful escape-clause [tariff], it is because it caused little harm and it helped Harley-Davidson get a bank loan so it could diversify. John Suomela, chief economist, U.S. International Trade Commission, 1993

In a recent survey of economists,  $87\%$  agreed with the statement "tariffs and import quotas usually reduce general economic welfare."2 It is no exaggeration to say that this belief has been a guiding principle of the international institutions established to govern the world economy since World War II, especially the World Trade Organization. That belief is the message from the previous chapter, which showed that the application of tariffs and quotas will reduce welfare for a small country. We also found that although a large country might gain from the application of a tariff, that gain would come at the expense of its trading partners, so the world as a whole would still lose. So there is really no good economic argument for the use of tariffs or quotas.

Still, you might wonder if that is really the whole story. We gave several recent examples of tariffs and quotas in the previous chapter, and there are many more examples if we look to countries at earlier stages in their development. For example, during

6 Conclusions the 1800s the United States had average tariff rates that fluctuated between  $10\%$  and  $50\%$ . These tariff rates were at times even higher than the Smoot-Hawley tariff that was applied during the Great Depression and peaked at  $25\%$ . Likewise, countries that industrialized after World War II, like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, started with high tariffs and quotas that were eliminated only slowly and incompletely. More recently, China had very high tariffs before it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and it still enjoys tariffs in some industries that are well above those in the United States or Europe.

These observations can lead us to wonder if there are some arguments in favor of tariffs that are missing from our treatment in the previous chapter, which dealt with perfect competition. Do the effects of trade policies differ when markets are imperfectly competitive? We explore the answer to this question in this chapter and the next.

This question received a good deal of attention from trade economists in the 1980s, in a body of research that became known as strategic trade policy. The idea of strategic trade policy was that government trade policies could give a strategic advantage to Home firms in imperfectly competitive markets that would enable them to compete more effectively with Foreign firms. Initially, the economists writing in this area thought that their research would challenge the idea that free trade is best for a country. As more research was done, however, supporters of strategic trade policy theory realized that the new arguments were limited in their scope: in some cases, the use of tariffs or quotas would backfire and harm the Home country, and in other cases, their use would give results similar to the large country case we analyzed in the previous chapter. We will give examples of both outcomes.

When countries use strategic trade policies to try to give advantage to their own firms, other countries trading with them often regard these policies as "unfair" and may respond to these policies in some way. That is the idea behind the first quotation at the beginning of the chapter from President Barack Obama, who announced in 2012 that the United States would establish a special "Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China." In the previous chapter we already discussed one trade policy recently used by the United States against China: the tariff on imports of Chinese tires (in effect from September 2009 to September 2012). In this chapter we discuss other examples, including tariffs recently imposed by the United States against imports of solar panels from China. To explore strategic trade policy, we need to abandon the assumption that markets are perfectly competitive, an assumption that was central to the treatment of the tariff and quota in the previous chapter. Instead, we need to allow for imperfect competition, which we defined in Chapter 6 as the market conditions that exist when firms have influence over the price that they charge and can charge a price above marginal costs for their goods. Recall that imperfect competition can arise when there is a small number of producers, as in a monopoly or oligopoly, or if products are differentiated from one another, as we assumed in our model of monopolistic competition in Chapter 6. In this chapter, we use the extreme case of a single producer—a Home or Foreign monopoly—to see how tariffs and quotas affect prices, trade, and welfare. In practice, imperfectly competitive industries often have more than one firm, but focusing on the monopoly case will give us the clearest sense of how the effects of these policy tools differ from those under perfect competition.

In this chapter, we begin by analyzing the effects of tariffs and quotas under the assumption of a Home monopoly. In the perfectly competitive framework of the previous chapter, quotas and tariffs have an equivalent impact on Home prices. In imperfectly competitive markets, however, these two trade policy instruments have different effects on Home prices, so the choice of which, if any, trade policy to implement must take these different effects into account.

The second case we analyze is a Foreign monopoly that exports to the Home market. We analyze the effect of an import tariff applied by the Home country and find that the tariff has effects similar to those in the large-country case under perfect competition (described in the previous chapter) in which the Home country can potentially gain from the tariff. A specific example of a Foreign monopolist is the Foreign discriminating monopoly, which charges a lower price to Home than to firms in its own local market and is therefore dumping its product into the Home market. A tariff applied against the Foreign discriminating monopoly is called an antidumping duty. Because of the special way in which antidumping duties are applied, they are unlikely to result in gains for the Home country and instead result in losses.

The final case we analyze is an infant industry at Home, by which we mean an industry that is too young to have achieved its lowest costs. Often these industries comprise a small number of firms. In our analysis, we assume there is only one firm, so it is again a case of Home monopoly. The special feature of this Home firm is that it cannot compete effectively under free trade, because the world price is below its minimum cost of production today, so the firm makes a loss. But by increasing its output today, the firm will learn how to produce its output more efficiently, and therefore have lower costs in the future, so that it can compete profitably at the world price. One way to achieve this end is for the government to step in and offer assistance—such as with a tariff—that will help the firm to survive long enough to achieve lower, world-competitive costs. This policy is called an "infant industry tariff."

Although we include the infant industry tariff argument in this chapter on strategic trade policy, it is actually a much older argument, dating back to the writings of John Stuart Mill (1806-1873). We will give several examples of infant industries, including the automobile industry in China, which imposed very high tariffs and quotas on foreign cars before it joined the WTO in 2001. We also use this argument to analyze the tariff used in the 1980s to protect Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the United States. The key policy question for an infant industry is whether a government should impose a temporary tariff today, to protect infant industry from competition, thereby keeping it in business long enough for it to learn how to achieve lower costs (and thus competitive prices) in the future.

# 1 Tariffs and Quotas with Home Monopoly

To illustrate the effect of tariffs and quotas under imperfect competition, we start with the example of a Home monopolist—a single firm selling a homogeneous good. In this case, free trade introduces many more firms selling the same good into the Home market, which eliminates the monopolist's ability to charge a price higher than its marginal cost (the free-trade equilibrium results in a perfectly competitive Home market). As we will show, tariffs and quotas affect this trade equilibrium differently because of their impact on the Home monopoly's market power, the extent to which a firm can set its price. With a tariff, the Home monopolist still competes against a large number of importers and so its market power is limited. With an import quota, on the other hand, once the quota limit is reached, the monopolist is the only producer able to sell in the Home market; hence, the Home monopolist can exercise its market power once again. This section describes the Home equilibrium with and without trade and explains this difference between tariffs and quotas.

# No-Trade Equilibrium

We begin by showing in Figure 9-1 the no-trade equilibrium with a Home monopoly. The Home demand curve is shown by  $D$ , and because it is downward-sloping, as the monopolist sells more, the price will fall. This fall in price means that the extra revenue earned by the monopolist from selling one more unit is less than the price: the extra revenue earned equals the price charged for that unit minus the fall in price times the quantity sold of all earlier units. The extra revenue earned from selling one more unit, the marginal revenue, is shown by curve  $MR$  in Figure 9-1.

To maximize its profits, the monopolist produces at the point where the marginal revenue  $MR$  earned from selling one more unit equals the marginal cost  $MC$  of producing one more unit. As shown in Figure 9-1, the monopolist produces quantity  $Q^{M}$ . Tracing up from  $Q^{M}$  to point  $A$  on the demand curve and then over to the price axis, the price charged by the monopolist is  $P^{M}$ . This price enables the monopolist to earn the highest profits and is the monopoly equilibrium in the absence of international trade.

Comparison with Perfect Competition We can contrast the monopoly equilibrium with the perfect competition equilibrium in the absence of trade. Instead of a single firm, suppose there are many firms in the industry. We assume that all these firms combined have the same cost conditions as the monopolist, so the industry marginal cost is identical to the monopolist's marginal cost curve of  $MC$ . Because a perfectly competitive industry will produce where price equals marginal cost, the

FIGURE 9-1

No-Trade Equilibrium In the absence of international trade, the monopoly equilibrium at Home occurs at the quantity  $Q^M$ , where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. From that quantity, we trace up to the demand curve at point  $A$ , and the price charged is  $P^M$ . Under perfect competition, the industry supply curve is  $MC$ , so the no-trade equilibrium would occur where demand equals supply (point  $B$ ), at the quantity  $Q^C$  and the price  $P^C$ .

$MC$  curve is also the industry supply curve. The no-trade equilibrium under perfect competition occurs where supply equals demand (the quantity  $Q^{C}$  and the price  $P^{C}$ ). The competitive price  $P^{C}$  is less than the monopoly price  $P^{M}$ , and the competitive quantity  $Q^{C}$  is higher than the monopoly quantity  $Q^{M}$ . This comparison shows that in the absence of trade, the monopolist restricts its quantity sold to increase the market price. Under free trade, however, the monopolist cannot limit quantity and raise price, as we investigate next.

# Free-Trade Equilibrium

Suppose now that Home engages in international trade. We will treat Home as a "small country," which means that it faces the fixed world price of  $P^W$ . In Figure 9-2, we draw a horizontal line at that price and label it as  $X^*$ , the Foreign export supply curve. At that price, Foreign will supply any quantity of imports (because Home is a small country, the Foreign export supply is perfectly elastic). Likewise, the Home monopolist can sell as much as it desires at the price of  $P^W$  (because it is able to export at the world price) but cannot charge any more than that price at Home. If it charged a higher price, Home consumers would import the product instead. Therefore, the Foreign supply curve of  $X^*$  is also the new demand curve facing the Home monopolist: the original no-trade Home demand of  $D$  no longer applies.

Because this new demand curve facing the Home monopolist is horizontal, the Home firm's new marginal revenue curve is the same as the demand curve, so  $X^{*} = MR^{*}$ . To understand why this is so, remember that marginal revenue equals the price earned from selling one more unit minus the fall in price times the quantity sold of all earlier units. For a horizontal demand curve, there is no fall in price from selling more because additional units sell for  $P^{W}$ , the same price for which the earlier units sell. Thus, marginal revenue is the price earned from selling another unit,  $P^{W}$ . Therefore,

FIGURE 9-2

# Home Monopoly's Free-Trade

Equilibrium Under free trade at the fixed world price  $P^W$ , Home faces Foreign export supply of  $X^{*}$  at that price. Because the Home firm cannot raise its price above  $P^W$  without losing all its customers to imports,  $X^{*}$  is now also the demand curve faced by the Home monopolist. Because the price is fixed, the marginal revenue  $MR^{*}$  is the same as the demand curve. Profits are maximized at point  $B$ , where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. The Home firm supplies  $S_{1}$ , and Home consumers demand  $D_{1}$ . The difference between these is imports,  $M_{1} = D_{1} - S_{1}$ . Because the Home monopoly now sets its price at marginal cost, the same free-trade equilibrium holds under perfect competition.

the demand curve  $X^{*}$  facing the Home monopolist is identical to the marginal revenue curve; the no-trade marginal revenue of  $MR$  no longer applies.

To maximize profits under the new free-trade market conditions, the monopolist will set marginal revenue equal to marginal cost (point  $B$  in Figure 9-2) and will supply  $S_{1}$  at the price  $P^{W}$ . At the price  $P^{W}$ , Home consumers demand  $D_{1}$ , which is more than the Home supply of  $S_{1}$ . The difference between demand and supply is Home imports under free trade, or  $M_{1} = D_{1} - S_{1}$ .

Comparison with Perfect Competition Let us once again compare this monopoly equilibrium with the perfect competition equilibrium, now with free trade. As before, we assume that the cost conditions facing the competitive firms are the same as those facing the monopolist, so the industry supply curve under perfect competition is equal to the monopolist's marginal cost curve of  $MC$ . With free trade and perfect competition, the industry will supply the quantity  $S_{1}$ , where the price  $P^{W}$  equals marginal cost, and consumers will demand the quantity  $D_{1}$  at the price  $P^{W}$ . Under free trade for a small country, then, a Home monopolist produces the same quantity and charges the same price as a perfectly competitive industry. The reason for this result is that free trade for a small country eliminates the monopolist's control over price; that is, its market power. It faces a horizontal demand curve, equal to marginal revenue, at the world price of  $P^{W}$ . Because the monopolist has no control over the market price, it behaves just as a competitive industry (with the same marginal costs) would behave.

This finding that free trade eliminates the Home monopolist's control over price is an extra source of gains from trade for the Home consumers because of the reduction in the monopolist's market power. We have already seen this extra gain in Chapter 6, in which we first discussed monopolistic competition. There we showed that with free trade, a monopolistically competitive firm faces more-elastic demand curves for its differentiated product, leading it to expand output and lower its prices. The same result holds in Figure 9-2, except that now we have assumed that the good produced by the Home monopolist and the imported good are homogeneous products, so they sell at exactly the same price. Because the Home good and the import are homogeneous, the demand curve  $X^{*}$  facing the Home monopolist in Figure 9-2 is perfectly elastic, leading the monopolist to behave in the same way under free trade as in a competitive industry.

# Effect of a Home Tariff

Now suppose the Home country imposes a tariff of  $t$  dollars on imports, which increases the Home price from  $P^{W}$  to  $P^{W} + t$ . In Figure 9-3, the effect of the tariff is to raise the Foreign export supply curve from  $X^{*}$  to  $X^{*} + t$ . The Home firm can sell as much as it desires at the price of  $P^{W} + t$  but cannot charge any more than that price. If it did, the Home consumers would import the product. Thus, the Foreign supply curve of  $X^{*} + t$  is also the new demand curve facing the Home monopolist.

Because this new demand curve is horizontal, the new marginal revenue curve is once again the same as the demand curve, so  $MR^{*} = X^{*} + t$ . The reasoning for this result is similar to the reasoning under free trade: with a horizontal demand curve, there is no fall in price from selling more, so the Home firm can sell as much as it desires at the price of  $P^{W} + t$ . So the demand curve  $X^{*} + t$  facing the Home monopolist is identical to its marginal revenue curve.

FIGURE 9-3

Tariff with Home Monopoly Initially under free trade at the fixed world price  $P^W$ , the monopolist faces the horizontal demand curve (and marginal revenue curve)  $X^*$ , and profits are maximized at point  $B$ . When a tariff  $t$  is imposed, the export supply curve shifts up since Foreign firms must charge  $P^W + t$  in the Home market to earn  $P^W$ . This allows the Home monopolist to increase its domestic price to  $P^W + t$ , but no higher, since otherwise it would lose all its customers to imports. The result is fewer imports,  $M_2$ , because Home supply  $S$  increases and Home demand  $D$  decreases. The deadweight loss of the tariff is measured by the area  $(b + d)$ . This result is the same as would have been obtained under perfect competition because the Home monopolist is still charging a price equal to its marginal cost.

To maximize profits, the monopolist will once again set marginal revenue equal to marginal costs, which occurs at point  $C$  in Figure 9-3, with the price  $P^{W} + t$  and supply of  $S_{2}$ . At the price  $P^{W} + t$ , Home consumers demand  $D_{2}$ , which is more than Home supply of  $S_{2}$ . The difference between demand and supply is Home imports,  $M_{2} = D_{2} - S_{2}$ . The effect of the tariff on the Home monopolist relative to the free-trade equilibrium is to raise its production from  $S_{1}$  to  $S_{2}$  and its price from  $P^{W}$  to  $P^{W} + t$ . The supply increase in combination with a decrease in Home demand reduces imports from  $M_{1}$  to  $M_{2}$ .

Comparison with Perfect Competition Let us compare this monopoly equilibrium with the tariff to what would happen under perfect competition. The tariff-inclusive price facing a perfectly competitive industry is  $P^{W} + t$ , the same price faced by the monopolist. Assuming that the industry supply curve under perfect competition is the same as the monopolist's marginal cost  $MC$ , the competitive equilibrium is where price equals marginal cost, which is once again at the quantity  $S_{2}$  and the price  $P^{W} + t$ . So with a tariff, a Home monopolist produces the same quantity and charges the same price as would a perfectly competitive industry. This result is similar to the result we found under free trade. This similarity occurs because the tariff still limits the monopolist's ability to raise its price: it can raise the price to  $P^{W} + t$  but no higher because otherwise consumers will import the product. Because the monopolist has limited control over its price, it behaves in the same way a competitive industry would when facing the tariff.

Home Loss Due to the Tariff Because the tariff and free-trade equilibria are the same for a Home monopoly and a perfectly competitive industry, the deadweight loss from the tariff is also the same. As we learned in the previous chapter, the deadweight loss under perfect competition is found by taking the total fall in consumer surplus due to the rise in price from  $P^W$  to  $P^W + t$ , adding the gain in producer surplus from the rise in price, and then adding the increase in government revenue due to the tariff. Summing all these components shows a net welfare loss of  $(b + d)$ :

<table><tr><td>Fall in consumer surplus:</td><td>-(a+b+c+d)</td></tr><tr><td>Rise in producer surplus:</td><td>+a</td></tr><tr><td>Rise in government revenue:</td><td>+c</td></tr><tr><td>Net effect on Home welfare:</td><td>-(b+d)</td></tr></table>

Under Home monopoly, the deadweight loss from the tariff is the same. Home consumers still have the loss of  $(a + b + c + d)$  because of the rise in price, while the Home monopolist gains the amount  $a$  in profits because of the rise in price. With the government collecting area  $c$  in tariff revenue, the deadweight loss is still area  $(b + d)$ .

# Effect of a Home Quota

Let us now contrast the tariff with an import quota imposed by the Home government. As we now show, the quota results in a higher price for Home consumers, and therefore a larger Home loss, than would a tariff imposed on the same equilibrium quantity of imports. The reason for the higher costs is that the quota creates a "sheltered" market for the Home firm, allowing it to exercise its monopoly power, which leads to higher prices than under a tariff. Economists and policy makers are well aware of this additional drawback to quotas, which is why the WTO has encouraged countries to replace many quotas with tariffs.

To show the difference between the quota and tariff with a Home monopoly, we use Figure 9-4, in which the free-trade equilibrium is at point  $B$  and the tariff equilibrium is at point  $C$  (the same points that appear in Figure 9-3). Now suppose that instead of the tariff, a quota is applied. We choose the quota so that it equals the imports under the tariff, which are  $M_2$ . Since imports are fixed at that level, the effective demand curve facing the Home monopolist is the demand curve  $D$  minus the amount  $M_2$ . We label this effective demand curve  $D - M_2$ . Unlike the situation under the tariff, the monopolist now retains the ability to influence its price: it can choose the optimal price and quantity along  $D - M_2$ . We graph the marginal revenue curve  $MR$  for the effective demand curve  $D - M_2$ . The profit-maximizing position for the monopolist is where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, at point  $E$ , with price  $P_3$  and supply  $S_3$ .

Let us now compare the tariff equilibrium, at point  $C$ , with the quota equilibrium, at point  $E$ . It will definitely be the case that the price charged under the quota is higher,  $P_{3} > P^{W} + t$ . The higher price under the quota reflects the ability of the monopolist to raise its price once the quota amount has been imported. The higher price occurs even though the quota equilibrium has the same level of imports as the tariff,  $M_{2}$ . Therefore, the effects of a tariff and a quota are no longer equivalent as they were under perfect competition: the quota enables a monopolist to exercise its market power and raise its price.

What about the quantity produced by the monopolist? Because the price is higher under the quota, the monopolist will definitely produce a lower quantity under the quota,  $S_{3} < S_{2}$ . What is more surprising, however, is that it is even possible that the quota could lead to a fall in output as compared with free trade: in Figure 9-4, we have shown  $S_{3} < S_{1}$ . This is not a necessary result, however, and instead we could

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/653bb326975684ce870e6d74888d2c45a4f6903c626d18eef0abc4fd4631ae04.jpg)

FIGURE 9-4

Effect of Quota with Home Monopoly Under free trade, the Home monopolist produces at point  $B$  and charges the world price of  $P^W$ . With a tariff of  $t$ , the monopolist produces at point  $C$  and charges the price of  $P^W + t$ . Imports under the tariff are  $M_2 = D_2 - S_2$ . Under a quota of  $M_2$ , the demand curve shifts to the left by that amount, resulting in the demand  $D - M_2$  faced by the Home monopolist. That is, after  $M_2$  units are imported, the monopolist is the only firm able to sell at Home, and so it can choose a price anywhere along the demand curve  $D - M_2$ . The marginal revenue curve corresponding to  $D - M_2$  is  $MR$ , and so with a quota, the Home monopolist produces at point  $E$ , where  $MR$  equals  $MC$ . The price charged at point  $E$  is  $P_3 > P^W + t$ , so the quota leads to a higher Home price than the tariff.

have drawn the  $MR$  curve so that  $S_{3} > S_{1}$ . It is surprising that the case  $S_{3} < S_{1}$  is even possible because it suggests that workers in the industry would fail to be protected by the quota; that is, employment could fall because of the reduction in output under the quota. We see, then, that the quota can have undesirable effects as compared with a tariff when the Home industry is a monopoly.

Home Loss Due to the Quota Our finding that Home prices are higher with a quota than with a tariff means that Home consumers suffer a greater fall in surplus because of the quota. On the other hand, the Home monopolist earns higher profit from the quota because its price is higher. We will not make a detailed calculation of the deadweight loss from the quota with Home monopoly because it is complicated. We can say, however, that the deadweight loss will always be higher for a quota than for a tariff because the Home monopolist will always charge a higher price. That higher price benefits the monopolist but harms Home consumers and creates an extra deadweight loss because of the exercise of monopoly power.

Furthermore, the fact that the Home monopolist is charging a higher price also increases the quota rents, which we defined in the previous chapter as the ability to import goods at the world price and sell them at the higher Home price (in our example, this is the difference between  $P_{3}$  and  $P^{W}$  times the amount of imports  $M_{2}$ ). In the case of Home monopoly, the quota rents are greater than government revenue would be under a tariff. Recall that quota rents are often given to Foreign countries in the case of "voluntary" export restraints, when the government of the exporting country implements the quota, or else quota rents can even be wasted completely when rent-seeking activities occur. In either of these cases, the increase in quota rents adds to Home's losses if the rents are given away or wasted.

In the next application, we examine a quota used in the United States during the 1980s to restrict imports of Japanese cars. Because the car industry has a small number of producers, it is imperfectly competitive. So our predictions from the case of monopoly discussed previously can serve as a guide for what we expect in the case of Home oligopoly.

# APPLICATION

# U.S. Imports of Japanese Automobiles

A well-known case of a "voluntary" export restraint (VER) for the United States occurred during the 1980s, when the U.S. limited the imports of cars from Japan. To understand why this VER was put into place, recall that during the early 1980s, the United States suffered a deep recession. That recession led to less spending on durable goods (such as automobiles), and as a result, unemployment in the auto industry rose sharply.

In 1980 the United Automobile Workers and Ford Motor Company applied to the International Trade Commission (ITC) for protection under Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and Section 201 of U.S. trade laws. As described in the previous chapter, Section 201 protection can be given when increased imports are a "substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry," where "substantial cause" must be "not less than any other cause." In fact, the ITC determined that the U.S. recession was a more important cause of injury to the auto industry than increased imports. Accordingly, it did not recommend that the auto industry receive protection.

With this negative determination, several members of Congress from states with auto plants continued to pursue import limits by other means. In April 1981 Senators John Danforth from Missouri and Lloyd Bentsen from Texas introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to restrict imports. Clearly aware of this pending legislation, the Japanese government announced on May 1 that it would "voluntarily" limit Japan's export of automobiles to the U.S. market. For the period April 1981 to March 1982, this limit was set at 1.83 million autos. After March 1984 the limit was raised to 2.02 million and then to 2.51 million vehicles annually. By 1988 imports fell below the VER limit because Japanese companies began assembling cars in the United States.

We are interested in whether American producers were able to exercise their monopoly power and raise their prices under the quota restriction. We are also interested in how much import prices increased. To measure the increase in import prices, we need to take into account a side effect of the 1980 quota: it led to an increase in the features of Japanese cars being sold in the United States such as size, weight, horsepower, and so on, or what we call an increase in quality. The overall increase in auto import prices during the 1980s needs to be broken up into the increases due to (1) the quality upgrading of Japanese cars; (2) the "pure" increase in price because of the quota, which equals the quota rents; and (3) any price increase that would have occurred anyway, even if the auto industry had not been subject to protection.

Price and Quality of Imports The impact of the VER on the price of Japanese cars is shown in Figure 9-5. Under the VER on Japanese car imports, the average price rose from  $5,150 to$ 8,050 between 1980 and 1985. Of that  \$2,900 increase,\$ 1,100

Prices of Japanese Car Imports Under the "voluntary" export restraint (VER) on Japanese car imports, the average price rose from  $5,150 to$ 8,050 between 1980 and 1985. Of that  \$2,900 increase,\$ 1,100 was the result of quota rent increases earned by Japanese producers. Another 1,650 was the result of quality improvements in the Japanese cars, which became heavier and wider, with improved horsepower, transmissions, and so on. The remaining 150 is the amount that import prices would have risen under free trade.

was the result of quota rents earned by Japanese producers in 1984 and 1985. Another  \$1,650 was from quality improvements in the Japanese cars, which became heavier and wider, with improved horsepower, transmissions, and so on. The remaining\$ 150 is the amount that import prices would have risen under free trade.

Quota Rents If we multiply the quota rents of  \$1,100 per car by the imports of about 2 million cars, we obtain total estimated rents of\$ 2.2 billion, which is the lower estimate of the annual cost of quota rents for automobiles. The upper estimate of 7.9 billion comes from also including the increase in price for European cars sold in the United States. Although European cars were not restricted by a quota, they did experience a significant increase in price during the quota period; that increase was due to the reduced competition from Japanese producers.

The Japanese firms benefited from the quota rents that they received. In fact, their stock prices rose during the VER period, though only after it became clear that the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry would administer the quotas to each producer (so that the Japanese firms would capture the rents). Moreover, because each producer was given a certain number of cars it could export to the United States, but no limit on the value of the cars, producers had a strong incentive to export more expensive models. That explains the quality upgrading that occurred during the quota, which was when Japanese producers started exporting more luxurious cars to the United States.

Price of U.S. Cars What happened to the prices of American small cars during this period? Under the VER on Japanese car imports, the average price of U.S. cars rose very rapidly when the quota was first imposed: from  $4,200 in 1979 to$ 6,000 in 1981, a 43\% increase over two years. That price increase was due to the exercise of market power by the U.S. producers, who were sheltered by the quota on their Japanese competitors. Only a small part of that price increase was explained by quality improvements since the quality of U.S. cars did not rise by as much as the quality of Japanese imports, as seen in Figure 9-6. So the American producers were able to benefit from the quota by raising their prices, and the Japanese firms also benefited by combining a price increase with an improvement in quality. The fact that both the Japanese and U.S. firms were able to increase their prices substantially indicates that the policy was very costly to U.S. consumers.

The GATT and WTO The VER that the United States negotiated with Japan in automobiles was outside of the GATT framework: because this export restraint was enforced by the Japanese rather than the United States, it did not necessarily violate Article XI of the GATT, which states that countries should not use quotas to restrict imports. Other countries used VERs during the 1980s and early 1990s to restrict imports in products such as automobiles and steel. All these cases were exploiting a loophole in the GATT agreement whereby a quota enforced by the exporter was not a violation of the GATT. This loophole was closed when the WTO was established in 1995. Part of the WTO agreement states that "a Member shall not seek, take or maintain any voluntary export restraints, orderly marketing arrangements or any other

similar measures on the export or the import side. These include actions taken by a single Member as well as actions under agreements, arrangements and understandings entered into by two or more Members."⁴ As a result of this rule, VERs can no longer be used unless they are a part of some other agreement in the WTO.

# 2 Tariffs with Foreign Monopoly

So far in this chapter, we have studied the effects of a tariff or quota under Home monopoly. For simplicity, we have focused on the case in which the Home country is small, meaning that the world price is fixed. Let us now examine a different case, in which we treat the Foreign exporting firm as a monopoly. We will show that applying a tariff under a Foreign monopoly leads to an outcome similar to that of the large-country case in the previous chapter; that is, the tariff will lower the price charged by the Foreign exporter. In contrast to the small-country case, a tariff may now benefit the Home country.

# Foreign Monopoly

To focus our attention on the Foreign monopolist selling to the Home market, we will assume that there is no competing Home firm, so the Home demand  $D$  in Figure 9-7 is supplied entirely by exports from the Foreign monopolist. This assumption is not very realistic because normally a tariff is being considered when there is also a Home firm. But ignoring the Home firm will simplify our analysis while still helping us to understand the effect of an imperfectly competitive Foreign exporter.

Free-Trade Equilibrium In addition to the Home demand of  $D$  in Figure 9-7, we also show Home marginal revenue of  $MR$ . Under free trade, the Foreign monopolist maximizes profits in its export market where Home marginal revenue  $MR$  equals Foreign marginal cost  $MC^{*}$ , at point  $A$  in Figure 9-7. It exports the amount  $X_{1}$  to the Home market and charges the price of  $P_{1}$ .

Effect of a Tariff on Home Price If the Home country applies an import tariff of  $t$  dollars, then the marginal cost for the exporter to sell in the Home market increases to  $MC^{*} + t$ . With the increase in marginal costs, the new intersection with marginal revenue occurs at point  $B$  in Figure 9-7, and the import price rises to  $P_{2}$ .

Under the case we have drawn in Figure 9-7, where the  $MR$  curve is steeper than the demand curve, the increase in price from  $P_{1}$  to  $P_{2}$  is less than the amount of the tariff  $t$ . In other words, the vertical rise along the  $MR$  curve caused by the tariff (the vertical distance from point  $A$  to  $B$ , which is the tariff amount) corresponds to a smaller vertical rise moving along the demand curve (the difference between  $P_{1}$  and  $P_{2}$ ). In this case, the net-of-tariff price received by the Foreign exporter, which is  $P_{3} = P_{2} - t$ , has fallen from its previous level of  $P_{1}$  because the price rises by less than the tariff. Since the Home country is paying a lower net-of-tariff price  $P_{3}$  for its import, it has experienced a terms-of-trade gain as a result of the tariff.

FIGURE 9-7

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/831e24d42027440ebbc03399ff4e5e63494fe25527212b201077d947dc425ffb.jpg)

Tariff with a Foreign Monopoly Under free trade, the Foreign monopolist charges prices  $P_{1}$  and exports  $X_{1}$ , where marginal revenue  $MR$  equals marginal cost  $MC^{*}$ . When an antidumping duty of  $t$  is applied, the firm's marginal cost rises to  $MC^{*} + t$ , so the exports fall to  $X_{2}$  and the Home price rises to  $P_{2}$ . The decrease in consumer surplus is shown by the area  $c + d$ , of which  $c$  is collected as a portion of tax revenues. The net-of-tariff price that the Foreign exporter receives falls to  $P_{3} = P_{2} - t$ . Because the net-of-tariff price has fallen, the Home country has a terms-of-trade gain, area  $e$ . Thus, the total welfare change depends on the size of the terms-of-trade gain  $e$  relative to the deadweight loss  $d$ .

The effect of the tariff applied against a Foreign monopolist is similar to the effect of a tariff imposed by a large country (analyzed in the previous chapter). There we found that a tariff would lower the price charged by Foreign firms because the quantity of exports decreased, so Foreign marginal costs also fell. Now that we have assumed a Foreign monopoly, we get the same result but for a different reason. The marginal costs of the monopolist are constant at  $MC^{*}$  in Figure 9-7, or  $MC^{*} + t$  including the tariff. The rise in marginal costs from the tariff leads to an increase in the tariff-inclusive Home price as the quantity of Home imports falls, but the monopolist chooses to increase the Home price by less than the full amount of the tariff. In that way, the quantity exported to Home does not fall by as much as it would if the Foreign firm increased its price by the full amount of the tariff. So, the Foreign firm is making a strategic decision to absorb part of the tariff itself (by lowering its price from  $P_{1}$  to  $P_{3}$ ) and pass through only a portion of the tariff to the Home price (which rises from  $P_{1}$  to  $P_{2}$ ).

Summary To preserve its sales to Home, the Foreign monopolist chooses to increase the Home price by less than the amount of the tariff. This result depends on having  $MR$  steeper than  $D$ , as shown in Figure 9-7. It is not necessarily the case that  $MR$  is steeper than  $D$  for all demand curves, but this is usually how we draw them. In the case of a straight-line demand curve such as the one drawn in Figure 9-7, for example, the marginal revenue curve is exactly twice as steep as the demand curve. In this case, the Home import price rises by exactly half of the tariff amount, and the Foreign export price falls by exactly half of the tariff amount.

Effect of the Tariff on Home Welfare With the rise in the Home price from  $P_{1}$  to  $P_{2}$ , consumers are worse off. The decline in consumer surplus equals the area between the two prices and to the left of the demand curve, which is  $(c + d)$  in Figure 9-7. The increase in the Home price would in principle benefit Home firms, but we have assumed for simplicity that there is no Home producer, so we do not need to keep track of the change in Home producer surplus. We do need to take account of tariff revenue collected by the Home government, however. Tariff revenue equals the amount of the tariff  $t$  times Foreign exports  $X_{2}$ , which is area  $(c + e)$ . Therefore, the effect of the tariff on Home welfare is

<table><tr><td>Fall in Home consumer surplus:</td><td>- (c+d)</td></tr><tr><td>Rise in Home government revenue:</td><td>+(c+e)</td></tr><tr><td>Net change in Home welfare:</td><td>+(e-d)</td></tr></table>

We can interpret the area  $e$  as the terms-of-trade gain for the Home country, whereas the area  $d$  is the deadweight loss from the tariff. If the terms-of-trade gain exceeds the deadweight loss,  $e > d$ , then Home gains overall by applying a tariff, similar to the result we found for a large country in the previous chapter. As we discussed there, we can expect the terms-of-trade gain to exceed the deadweight loss when the tariff is small, so that Home welfare initially rises for small tariffs. Welfare then reaches some maximum level and then falls as the tariff is increased beyond its optimal level. The same results apply when a tariff is placed against a Foreign monopolist, provided that the marginal revenue curve is steeper than demand, as we have assumed.

To illustrate how a tariff can affect the prices charged by a Foreign monopolist in practice, we once again use the automobile industry as an example. Because there are a small number of firms in that industry, it is realistic to expect them to respond to a tariff in the way that a Foreign monopolist would.

# APPLICATION

# Import Tariffs on Japanese Trucks

We have found that in the case of a Foreign monopolist, Home will experience a terms-of-trade gain from a small tariff. The reason for this gain is that the Foreign firm will lower its net-of-tariff price to avoid too large an increase in the price paid by consumers in the importing country. To what extent do Foreign exporters actually behave that way?

To answer this question, we can look at the effects of the  $25\%$  tariff on imported Japanese compact trucks imposed by the United States in the early 1980s and still in place today. The history of how this tariff came to be applied is an interesting story. Recall from the application earlier in the chapter that in 1980 the United Automobile

Workers and Ford Motor Company applied for a tariff under Article XIX of the GATT and Section 201 of U.S. trade law. They were turned down for the tariff, however, because the International Trade Commission determined that the U.S. recession was a more important cause of injury in the auto industry than growing imports. For cars, the "voluntary" export restraint (VER) with Japan was pursued. But for compact trucks imported from Japan, it turned out that another form of protection was available.

At that time, most compact trucks from Japan were imported as cab/chassis with some final assembly needed. These were classified as "parts of trucks," which carried a tariff rate of only  $4\%$ . But another category of truck—"complete or unfinished trucks"—faced a tariff rate of  $25\%$ . That unusually high tariff was a result of the "chicken war" between the United States and West Germany in 1962. At that time, Germany joined the European Economic Community (EEC) and was required to adjust its external tariffs to match those of the other EEC countries. This adjustment resulted in an increase in its tariff on imported U.S. poultry. In retaliation, the United States increased its tariffs on trucks and other products, so the  $25\%$  tariff on trucks became a permanent item in the U.S. tariff code.

That tariff created an irresistible opportunity to reclassify the Japanese imports and obtain a substantial increase in the tariff, which is exactly what the U.S. Customs Service did with prodding from the U.S. Congress. Effective August 21, 1980, imported cab/chassis "parts" were reclassified as "complete or unfinished" trucks. This reclassification raised the tariff rate on all Japanese trucks from  $4\%$  to  $25\%$ , which remains in effect today.

How did Japanese exporters respond to the tariff? According to one estimate, the tariff on trucks was only partially reflected in U.S. prices: of the  $21\%$  increase, only  $12\%$  (or about  $60\%$  of the increase) was passed through to U.S. consumer prices; the other  $9\%$  (or about  $40\%$  of the increase) was absorbed by Japanese producers.[7] Therefore, this tariff led to a terms-of-trade gain for the United States, as predicted by our theory: for a straight-line demand curve (as in Figure 9-7), marginal revenue is twice as steep, and the tariff will lead to an equal increase in the Home import price and decrease in the Foreign export price.[8] The evidence for Japanese trucks is not too different from what we predict in that straight-line case.

Notice that the terms-of-trade gain from the tariff applied on a Foreign monopolist is similar to the terms-of-trade gain from a tariff applied by a "large" country, as we discussed in the previous chapter. In both cases, the Foreign firm or industry absorbs part of the tariff by lowering its price, which means that the Home price rises by less than the full amount of the tariff. If the terms-of-trade gain, measured by the area  $e$  in Figure 9-7 exceed the deadweight loss  $d$ , then the Home country gains from the tariff. This is our first example of strategic trade policy that leads to a potential gain for Home.

In principle, this potential gain arises from the tariff that the United States has applied on imports of compact trucks, and that is still in place today. But some economists feel that this tariff has the undesirable side effect of encouraging the U.S. automobile industry to focus on the sales of trucks, since compact trucks have higher prices because of the tariff. $^{9}$  That strategy by U.S. producers can work when gasoline prices are low, so consumers are willing to buy trucks. At times of high prices, however, consumers instead want fuel-efficient cars, which have not been the focus of the American industry. So high fuel prices can lead to a surge in imports and fewer domestic sales, exactly what happened after the oil price increase of 1979 and again in 2008, just before the financial crisis. Some industry experts believe that these factors contributed to the losses faced by the American industry during the crisis, as explained in Headlines: The Chickens Have Come Home to Roost.

# HEADLINES

# The Chickens Have Come Home to Roost

This article discusses the history of the  $25\%$  tariff that still applies to U.S. imports of lightweight trucks. The author argues that this tariff caused some of the difficulties in the U.S. automobile industry today.

Although we call them the big three automobile companies, they have basically specialized in building trucks. This left them utterly unable to respond when high gas prices shifted the market towards hybrids and more fuel efficient cars.

One reason is that Americans like to drive SUVs, minivans and small trucks when gasoline costs  $1.50 to$ 2.00 a gallon. But another is that the profit margins have been much higher on trucks and vans because the US protects its domestic market with a twenty-five percent tariff. By contrast, the import tariff on regular automobiles is just 2.5 percent and US duties from tariffs on all imported goods are just one percent of the overall value of merchandise imports. Since many of the inputs used to assemble trucks are not subject to tariffs anywhere near 25 percent—US tariffs on all goods average only 3.5 percent—the effective protection and subsidy equivalent of this policy has been huge.

It is no wonder much of the initial foray by Japanese transplants to the US involved setting up trucks assembly plants, no wonder that Automakers only put three doors on SUVs so they can qualify as vans and no wonder that Detroit is so opposed to the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement that would eventually allow trucks built in Korea Duty-Free access to the US market.

What accounts for this distinctive treatment of trucks? An accident of history that shows how hard it is for the government to withdraw favors even when they have no sound policy justification.

It all comes down to the long forgotten chicken wars of the 1960s. In 1962, when implementing the European Common Market, the Community denied access to US chicken producers. In response after being unable to resolve the issue Diplomatically, the US responded with retaliatory tariffs that included a twenty five percent tariffs on trucks that was aimed at the German Volkswagen

Combi-Bus that was enjoying brisk sales in the US.

Since the trade (GATT) rules required that retaliation be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis, the tariffs were levied on all truck-type vehicles imported from all countries and have never been removed. Over time, the Germans stopped building these vehicles and today the tariffs are mainly paid on trucks coming from Asia. The tariffs have bred bad habits, steering Detroit away from building high-quality automobiles towards trucks and trucklike cars that have suddenly fallen into disfavor.

If Congress wants an explanation for why the big three have been so uncompetitive it should look first at the disguised largess it has been providing them with for years. It has taken a long time—nearly 47 years—but it seems that eventually the chickens have finally come home to roost.

# 3 Dumping

With imperfect competition, firms can charge different prices across countries and will do so whenever that pricing strategy is profitable. Recall that we define imperfect competition as the firm's ability to influence the price of its product. With international trade, we extend this idea: not only can firms charge a price that is higher than their marginal cost, they can also choose to charge different prices in their domestic market than in their export market. This pricing strategy is called price discrimination because the firm is able to choose how much different groups of customers pay. To discriminate in international trade, there must be some reason that consumers in the high-price market cannot import directly from the low-cost market; for example, that reason could be transportation costs or tariffs between the markets.

Dumping occurs when a foreign firm sells a product abroad at a price that is either less than the price it charges in its local market, or less than its average cost to produce the product. Dumping is common in international trade, even though the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) discourage this activity. Under the rules of the WTO, an importing country is entitled to apply a tariff any time a foreign firm dumps its product on a local market. Such a tariff is called an antidumping duty. We study antidumping duties in detail in the next section. In this section, we want to ask the more general question: Why do firms dump at all? It might appear at first glance that selling abroad at prices less than local prices or less than the average costs of production must be unprofitable. Is that really the case? It turns out the answer is no. It can be profitable to sell at low prices abroad, even at prices lower than average cost.

Discriminating Monopoly To illustrate how dumping can be profitable, we use the example of a Foreign monopolist selling both to its local market and exporting to Home. As described previously, we assume that the monopolist is able to charge different prices in the two markets; this market structure is sometimes called a discriminating monopoly. The diagram for a Foreign discriminating monopoly is shown in Figure 9-8. The local demand curve for the monopolist is  $D^{*}$ , with marginal revenue  $MR^{*}$ . We draw these curves as downward-sloping for the monopolist because to induce additional consumers to buy its product, the monopolist lowers its price (downward-sloping  $D^{*}$ ), which decreases the revenue received from each additional unit sold (downward-sloping  $MR^{*}$ ).

In the export market, however, the Foreign firm will face competition from other firms selling to the Home market. Because of this competition, the firm's demand curve in the export market will be more elastic; that is, it will lose more customers by raising prices than it would in its local market. If it faces enough competition in its export market, the Foreign monopolist's export demand curve will be horizontal at the price  $P$ , meaning that it cannot charge more than the competitive market price. If the price for exports is fixed at  $P$ , selling more units does not depress the price or the extra revenue earned for each unit exported. Therefore, the marginal revenue for exports equals the price, which is labeled as  $P$  in Figure 9-8.

Equilibrium Condition We can now determine the profit-maximizing level of production for the Foreign monopolist, as well as its prices in each market. For the discriminating monopoly, profits are maximized when the following condition holds:

$$
M R = M R ^ {*} = M C ^ {*}
$$

# FIGURE 9-8

Foreign Discriminating Monopoly The Foreign monopoly faces different demand curves and charges different prices in its local and export markets. Locally, its demand curve is  $D^{*}$  with marginal revenue  $MR^{*}$ . Abroad, its demand curve is horizontal at the export price,  $P$ , which is also its marginal revenue of  $MR$ . To maximize profits, the Foreign monopolist chooses to produce the quantity  $Q_{1}$  at point  $B$ , where local marginal cost equals marginal revenue in the export market,  $MC^{*} = MR$ . The quantity sold in the local market,  $Q_{2}$  (at point  $C$ ), is determined where local marginal revenue equals export marginal revenue,  $MR^{*} = MR$ . The Foreign monopolist sells  $Q_{2}$  to its local market at  $P^{*}$  and  $Q_{1} - Q_{2}$  to its export market at  $P$ . Because  $P < P^{*}$  (or alternatively  $P < AC_{1}$ ), the firm is dumping.

This equation looks similar to the condition for profit maximization for a single-market monopolist, which is marginal revenue equals marginal cost, except that now the marginal revenues should also be equal in the two markets.

We illustrate this equilibrium condition in Figure 9-8. If the Foreign firm produces quantity  $Q_{1}$ , at point  $B$ , then the marginal cost of the last unit equals the export marginal revenue  $MR$ . But not all of the supply  $Q_{1}$  is exported; some is sold locally. The amount sold locally is determined by the equality of the firm's local marginal revenue  $MR^{*}$  with its export marginal revenue  $MR$  (at point  $C$ ), and the equality of its local marginal cost  $MC^{*}$  with  $MR$  (at point  $B$ ). All three variables equal  $P$ , though the firm charges the price  $P^{*}$  (by tracing up the Foreign demand curve) to its local consumers. Choosing these prices, the profit-maximization equation just given is satisfied, and the discriminating monopolist is maximizing profits across both markets.

The Profitability of Dumping The Foreign firm charges  $P^{*}$  to sell quantity  $Q_{2}$  in its local market (from  $Q_{2}$ , we go up to the local demand curve  $D^{*}$  and across to the price). The local price exceeds the price  $P$  charged in the export market. Because the

Foreign firm is selling the same product at a lower price to the export market, it is dumping its product into the export market.

What about the comparison of its export price with average costs? At total production of  $Q_{1}$  at point  $B$ , the firm's average costs are read off the average cost curve above that point, so average costs equal  $AC_{1}$ , lower than the local price  $P^{*}$  but higher than the export price  $P$ . Because average costs  $AC_{1}$  are above the export price  $P$ , the firm is also dumping according to this cost comparison. But we will argue that the Foreign firm still earns positive profits from exporting its good at the low price of  $P$ . To see why that is the case, we turn to a numerical example.

# Numerical Example of Dumping

Suppose the Foreign firm has the following cost and demand data:

$$
\text {F i x e d} \quad \text {c o s t s} \quad = \quad \$ 1 0 0
$$

$$
\text {M a r g i n a l} = \$ 1 0 \text {p e r u n i t}
$$

$$
\text {L o c a l p r i c e} = \$ 2 5
$$

$$
\text {L o c a l} \quad \text {q u a n t i t y} \quad = \quad 1 0
$$

$$
\text {E x p o r t p r i c e} = \$ 1 5
$$

$$
\text {E x p o r t q u a n t i t y} = 1 0
$$

The profits earned from selling in its local market are

$$
\underbrace {(\$ 25 \cdot 1 0)} _ {\text {R e v e n u e}} - \underbrace {\$ 1 0 \cdot 1 0} _ {\text {V a r i a b l e}} - \underbrace {\$ 1 0 0} _ {\text {F i x e d}} = \underbrace {\$ 5 0} _ {\text {P r o f i t s}}
$$

Notice that the average costs for the firms are

$$
\text {A v e r a g e} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2 0 0}{1 0} = \mathbb {S} 2 0
$$

Now suppose that this firm sells an additional 10 units abroad, at the price of 15, which is less than its average cost of production. It is still worthwhile to sell these extra units because profits become

$$
\underbrace {(\underline {{\mathbb {S} 2 5 \cdot 1 0 + \mathbb {S} 1 5 \cdot 1 0}})} _ {\text {R e v e n u e}} - \underbrace {\underline {{\mathbb {S} 1 0 \cdot 2 0}}} _ {\text {V a r i a b l e}} - \underbrace {\underline {{\mathbb {S} 1 0 0}}} _ {\text {F i x e d}} = \underbrace {\underline {{\mathbb {S} 1 0 0}}} _ {\text {P r o f i t s}}
$$

Profits have increased because the extra units are sold at  \$15 but produced at a marginal cost of\$ 10, which is less than the price received in the export market. Therefore, each unit exported will increase profits by the difference between the price and marginal costs. Thus, even though the export price is less than average costs, profits still rise from dumping in the export market.

# 4 Policy Response to Dumping

In the previous section, we learned that dumping is not unusual: a Foreign monopolist that discriminates between its local and export markets by charging different prices in each can end up charging a lower price in its export market. Furthermore, the price it charges in its export market might be less than its average cost of production and still be profitable. Our interest now is in understanding the policy response in the Home importing country.

# Antidumping Duties

Under the rules of the WTO, an importing country is entitled to apply a tariff—called an antidumping duty—any time that a foreign firm is dumping its product. An imported product is being dumped if its price is below the price that the exporter charges in its own local market; if the exporter's local price is not available, then dumping is determined by comparing the import price to (1) a price charged for the product in a third market or (2) the exporter's average costs of production.[10] If one of these criteria is satisfied, then the exporting firm is dumping and the importing country can respond with antidumping duty. The amount of the antidumping duty is calculated as the difference between the exporter's local price and the "dumped" price in the importing country.

There are many examples of countries applying antidumping duties. In 2006 the European Union applied tariffs of  $10\%$  to  $16.5\%$  on shoes imported from China and  $10\%$  on shoes imported from Vietnam. These antidumping duties were justified because of the low prices at which the imported shoes are sold in Europe. These duties expired in 2011. A recent example of antidumping duties from the United States are those applied to the imports of solar panels from China, discussed next.

# APPLICATION

# United States Imports of Solar Panels from China

Since November 2012, the United States has applied antidumping duties on the imports of solar panels from China. In addition to the antidumping duties, another tariff—called a countervailing duty—has been applied against imports of solar panels from China. A countervailing duty is used when the Foreign government subsidizes its own exporting firms so that they can charge lower prices for their exports. We will examine export subsidies in the next chapter. For now, we'll just indicate the amount of the subsidy provided by the Chinese government to their firms that export solar panels. Later in the chapter, we'll discuss the type of subsidies the U.S. government provides to American producers of solar panels.

In October 2011, seven U.S. companies led by SolarWorld Industries America, based in Hillsboro, Oregon, filed a trade case against Chinese exporters of photovoltaic cells, or solar panels. These U.S. companies argued that the Chinese firms were dumping solar panels into the United States—that is, they were exporting them at less than the costs of production—and also that these firms were receiving substantial export subsidies from the Chinese government. These twin claims of dumping and of export subsidies triggered several investigations by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission (ITC), to determine the U.S. response.

The ITC completed its first investigation in December 2011, and made a preliminary finding that the U.S. companies bringing the trade case had been harmed—or "materially injured"—by the U.S. imports of solar panels from China. From 2009 to 2011, imports of solar panels from China increased by four times, and their value grew from  \$640 million to more than\$ 3 billion. During this period, several American solar panel producers went bankrupt, so it was not surprising that the ITC found material injury due to imports.

Following the ITC's investigation, the U.S. Department of Commerce held two inquiries during 2012 to determine the extent of dumping and the extent of Chinese export subsidies. It is particularly difficult to determine the extent of dumping when the exporting firm is based in a nonmarket economy like China, because it is hard to determine the market-based costs of the firms. To address this difficulty, the Department of Commerce looked at the costs of production in another exporting country—Thailand—and used those costs to estimate what market-based costs in China would be.[11] In a preliminary ruling in May 2012, and a later ruling in October 2012, the Department of Commerce found that a group of affiliated producers, all owned by Suntech Power Holdings, Co., Ltd., were selling in the United States at prices  $32\%$  below costs, and that a second group of producers were selling at  $18\%$  below costs. The  $32\%$  and  $18\%$  gaps include an export subsidy of about  $11\%$ . Because there was an additional export subsidy of  $4\%$  to  $6\%$  paid to the Chinese producers that was not reflected in the  $32\%$  and  $18\%$  gaps between costs and prices, tariffs of  $36\%$  were recommended for the first group of producers, and tariffs of  $24\%$  were recommended for the others.

In November 2012, the ITC made a final determination of material injury to the U.S. solar panel industry, and the tariffs went into effect. Not all American producers supported these tariffs, however, because they raised costs for firms such as SolarCity Corp., which finances and installs rooftop solar systems. These firms are the consumers of the imported solar panels and they face higher prices as a result of the tariffs. Despite the tariffs, the installation of solar panels is a thriving industry in the United States today, and the higher prices protect the remaining U.S. manufacturers of solar panels.

Strategic Trade Policy? The purpose of an antidumping duty is to raise the price of the dumped good in the importing Home country, thereby protecting the domestic producers of that good. There are two reasons for the Home government to use this policy. The first reason is that Foreign firms are acting like discriminating monopolists, as we discussed above. Then because we are dealing with dumping by a Foreign monopolist, we might expect that the antidumping duty, which is a tariff, will lead to a terms-of-trade gain for the Home country. That is, we might expect that the Foreign monopolist will absorb part of the tariff through lowering its own price, as was illustrated in Figure 9-7. It follows that the rise in the consumer price in the importing country is less than the full amount of the tariff, as was illustrated in the application dealing with Japanese compact trucks.

Does the application of antidumping duties lead to a terms-of-trade gain for the Home country, making this another example of strategic trade policy that can potentially benefit the Home country? In the upcoming analysis, we'll find that the answer to this question is "no," and that the antidumping provisions of U.S. trade law are overused and create a much greater cost for consumers and larger deadweight loss than does the less frequent application of tariffs under the safeguard provision, Article XIX of the GATT.[12]

A second reason for the Home government to use an antidumping duty is because of predatory dumping. Predatory dumping refers to a situation in which a Foreign firm sells at a price below its average costs with the intention of causing Home firms to suffer losses and, eventually, to leave the market because of bankruptcy. Predatory pricing behavior can occur within a country (between domestic firms), but when it occurs across borders between a Foreign and Home firm, it is called dumping. Economists generally believe that such predatory behavior is rare: the firm engaged in the predatory pricing behavior must believe that it can survive its own period of losses (due to low prices) for longer than the firm or firms it is trying to force out of the market. Furthermore, the other firms must have no other option except to exit the market even though the firm using the predatory pricing can survive. If we are truly dealing with a case of predatory dumping, then the discussion that follows (about the effect of an antidumping duty) does not really apply. Instead, we need to consider a more complicated model in which firms are deciding whether to enter and remain in the market. In the next chapter's discussion of export subsidies, we analyze such a model. In this chapter, we focus on dumping by a discriminating Foreign monopoly and the effect of an antidumping duty in that case.

Comparison with Safeguard Tariff It is important to recognize that the tariff on compact trucks, discussed in the earlier application, was not an antidumping duty. Rather, it was a safeguard tariff applied under Section 201 of the U.S. tariff code, or Article XIX of the GATT. Because the tariff on trucks was increased in the early 1980s and has not been changed since, it fits our assumption that Foreign firms treat the tariff as fixed. That assumption does not hold for antidumping duties, however, because Foreign exporting firms can influence the amount of an antidumping duty by their own choice of prices. In fact, the evidence shows that Foreign firms often change their prices and increase the price charged in the importing country even before an antidumping tariff is applied. To see why this occurs, let us review how the antidumping duty is calculated.

Calculation of Antidumping Duty The amount of an antidumping duty is calculated based on the Foreign firm's local price. If its local price is \$10 (after converting from Foreign's currency to U.S. dollars), and its export price to the Home market is \$6, then the antidumping tariff is calculated as the difference between these prices, \$4 in our example. This method of calculating the tariff creates an incentive for the Foreign firm to raise its export price even before the tariff is applied so that the duty will be lower. If the Foreign firm charges an export price of \$8 instead of \$4 but maintains its local price of \$10, then the antidumping tariff would be only \$2. Alternatively, the Foreign firm could charge \$10 in its export market (the same as its local price) and avoid the antidumping tariff altogether!

Thus, the calculation of an antidumping duty creates a strong incentive for Foreign firms to raise their export prices to reduce or avoid the duty. This increase in the import price results in a terms-of-trade loss for the Home country. Such an increase in the import price is illustrated in Figure 9-9 as the rise from price  $P_{1}$  to  $P_{2}$ . This price increase leads to a gain for Home firms of area  $a$ , but a loss for Home consumers of area  $(a + b + c + d)$ . There is no revenue collected when the duty is not imposed, so the net loss for the Home country is area  $(b + c + d)$ . This loss is higher than the dead-weight loss from a tariff (which is area  $b + d$ ) and illustrates the extra costs associated with the threat of an antidumping duty.

Home Loss Due to Threat of Duty A charge of dumping can sometimes lead Foreign firms to increase their prices, even without an antidumping duty being applied. In that case, there is a loss for Home consumers  $(a + b + c + d)$  and a gain for Home producers  $(a)$ . The net loss for the Home country is area  $(b + c + d)$ .

Furthermore, the fact that Foreign firms will raise their prices to reduce the potential duty gives Home firms an incentive to charge Foreign firms with dumping, even if none is occurring: just the threat of an antidumping duty is enough to cause Foreign firms to raise their prices and reduce competition in the market for that good. As the following application shows, these incentives lead to excessive filings of antidumping cases.

# APPLICATION

# Antidumping Duties Versus Safeguard Tariffs

In the previous chapter, we discussed the "safeguard" provision in Article XIX of the GATT (Side Bar: Key Provisions of the GATT) and Section 201 of U.S. trade law. This provision, which permits temporary tariffs to be applied, is used infrequently. As shown in Table 9-1, from 1980 to 1989, only 19 safeguard (also called "escape clause") cases were filed in the United States. In the following decade there were only nine, and from 2000 to 2011 only three such cases were filed. In each case, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) must determine whether rising imports are the "most important cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry." Of the 31 cases filed from 1980 to 2011, the ITC made a negative recommendation (i.e., it did not approve the tariff requests) in 16, or about one-half the cases. One of those negative recommendations was for the tariff on Japanese compact trucks discussed in the earlier application: the ITC made a negative recommendation for both cars and trucks in 1980, but trucks still obtained a tariff by reclassifying the type of trucks being imported.

The ITC made an affirmative ruling for protection in 12 cases, which then went for a final ruling to the President, who recommended import protection in only nine cases.[13] An example of a positive recommendation was the tariff on the import of steel, as discussed in the previous chapter, and the tariff imposed on heavyweight motorcycles, discussed later in this chapter. That only 31 cases were brought forward in three decades, and that tariffs were approved by the President in only nine cases, shows how infrequently this trade provision is used.

In the next panel of Table 9-1, we show the number of China-specific safeguard cases. This new trade provision, discussed in the previous chapter, took effect in 2001. Since that time, seven cases have been filed, of which two were denied by the ITC and five were approved. Of these five approved tariffs, the President also ruled in favor only once—the tariff imposed on imports of tires from China, approved by President Obama in 2009 and in effect until 2012.

The infrequent use of the safeguard provision can be contrasted with the many cases of antidumping duties. The cases filed in the United States under this provision are also listed in Table 9-1, which shows that the number of antidumping cases vastly exceeds safeguard cases. From 1980 to 1989 and from 1990 to 1999, there were more than 400 antidumping cases filed in the United States. In the next 12 years, 2000 to 2011, there were more than 300 antidumping cases, bringing the total number of antidumping cases filed from 1980 to 2011 to more than 1,200!

To have antidumping duties applied, a case must first go to the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), which rules on whether imports are selling domestically at "less than fair value"; that is, below the price in their own market or below the average cost of making them. These rulings were positive in  $93\%$  of cases during this period. The case is then brought before the ITC, which must rule on whether imports have caused "material injury" to the domestic industry (defined as "harm that is not inconsequential, immaterial, or unimportant"). This criterion is much easier to meet than the "substantial cause of serious injury" provision for a safeguard tariff, and as a result, the ITC more frequently rules in favor of antidumping duties. Furthermore, the application of duties does not require the additional approval of the President. Of the 1,200 antidumping cases filed from 1980 to 2011, about 450 were rejected and another 550 had duties levied.

The remaining 150 antidumping cases (or 148 to be precise, shown at the bottom of Table 9-1) fall into a surprising third category: those that are withdrawn prior to a ruling by the ITC. It turns out that the U.S. antidumping law actually permits U.S. firms to withdraw their case and, acting through an intermediary at the DOC, agree with the foreign firm on the level of prices and market shares! As we would expect, these withdrawn and settled cases result in a significant increase in market prices for the importing country.

Why do firms make claims of dumping so often? If a dumping case is successful, a duty will be applied against the Foreign competitor, and the import price will increase. If the case is withdrawn and settled, then the Foreign competitor will also raise its price. Even if the case is not successful, imports often decline while the DOC or ITC is making an investigation, and the smaller quantity of imports also causes their price to rise. So regardless of the outcome of a dumping case, the increase in the price of Foreign imports benefits Home firms by allowing them to charge more for their own goods. As a result, Home producers have a strong incentive to file for protection from dumping, whether it is occurring or not.

Because of the large number of antidumping cases and because exporting firms raise their prices to avoid the antidumping duties, this trade policy can be quite costly. According to one estimate, the annual cost to the United States from its antidumping policies is equivalent to the deadweight loss of a  $6\%$  uniform tariff applied across all imports.[14]

# 5 Infant Industry Protection

We now turn to the final application of tariffs that we will study in this chapter, and that is a tariff applied to an industry that is too young to withstand foreign competition, and so will suffer losses when faced with world prices under free trade. Given time to grow and mature, the industry will be able to compete in the future. The only way that a firm in this industry could cover its losses today would be to borrow against its future profits. But if banks are not willing to lend to this firm—perhaps because it is small and inexperienced—then it will go bankrupt today unless the government steps in and offers some form of assistance, such as with a tariff or quota. This argument is called the "infant industry case" for protection. Although we include the infant industry tariff argument in this chapter on strategic trade policy, the idea of protecting a young industry dates back to the writings of John Stuart Mill (1806-1873).

To analyze this argument and make use of our results from the previous sections, we assume there is only one Home firm, so it is again a case of Home monopoly. The special feature of this Home firm is that increasing its output today will lead to lower costs in the future because it will learn how to produce its output more efficiently and at a lower cost. The question, then, is whether the Home government should intervene with a temporary protective tariff or quota today, so that the firm can survive long enough to achieve lower costs and higher profits in the future.

There are two cases in which infant industry protection is potentially justified. First, protection may be justified if a tariff today leads to an increase in Home output that, in turn, helps the firm learn better production techniques and reduce costs in the future. This is different from increasing returns to scale as discussed in Chapter 6. With increasing returns to scale, lower costs arise from producing farther down along a decreasing average cost curve; while a tariff might boost Home production and lower costs, removing the tariff would reduce production to its initial level and still leave the firm uncompetitive at world prices. For infant industry protection to be justified, the firm's learning must shift down the entire average cost curve to the point where it is competitive at world prices in the future, even without the tariff.

If the firm's costs are going to fall in the future, then why doesn't it simply borrow today to cover its losses and pay back the loan from future profits? Why does it need import protection to offset its current losses? The answer was already hinted at above: banks may be unwilling to lend to this firm because they don't know with certainty that the firm will achieve lower costs and be profitable enough in the future to repay the loan. In such a situation, a tariff or quota offsets an imperfection in the market for borrowing and lending (the capital market). What is most essential for the infant industry argument to be valid is not imperfect competition (a single Home firm), but rather, this imperfection in the Home capital market.

A second case in which import protection is potentially justified is when a tariff in one period leads to an increase in output and reductions in future costs for other firms in the industry, or even for firms in other industries. This type of externality occurs when firms learn from each other's successes. For instance, consider the high-tech semiconductor industry. Each firm innovates its products at a different pace, and when one firm has a technological breakthrough, other firms benefit by being able to copy the newly developed knowledge. In the semiconductor industry, it is not unusual for firms to mimic the successful innovations of other firms, and benefit from a knowledge spillover. In the presence of spillovers, the infant industry tariff promotes a positive externality: an increase in output for one firm lowers the costs for everyone. Because firms learn from one another, each firm on its own does not have much incentive to invest in learning by increasing its production today. In this case, a tariff is needed to offset this externality by increasing production, allowing for these spillovers to occur among firms so that there are cost reductions.

As both of these cases show, the infant industry argument supporting tariffs or quotas depends on the existence of some form of market failure. In our first example, the market does not provide loans to the firm to allow it to avoid bankruptcy; in the second, the firm may find it difficult to protect its intellectual knowledge through patents, which would enable it to be compensated for the spillover of knowledge to others. These market failures create a potential role for government policy. In practice, however, it can be very difficult for a government to correct market failure. If the capital market will not provide loans to a firm because it doesn't think the firm will be profitable in the future, then why would the government have better information about that firm's future prospects? Likewise, in the case of a spillover of knowledge to other firms, we cannot expect the government to know the extent of spillovers. Thus, we should be skeptical about the ability of government to distinguish the industries that deserve infant industry protection from those that do not.

Furthermore, even if either of the two conditions we have identified to potentially justify infant industry protection hold, these market failures do not guarantee that the protection will be worthwhile—we still need to compare the future benefits of protection (which are positive) with its costs today (the deadweight losses). So while some form of market failure is a prerequisite condition for infant industry protection to be justified, we will identify two further conditions below that must be satisfied for the protection to be successful. With these warnings in mind, let's look at how infant industry protection can work.

# Free-Trade Equilibrium

In panel (a) of Figure 9-10, we show the situation a Home firm faces today, and in panel (b) we show its situation in the future. We assume that the Home country is small and therefore faces a fixed world price. As discussed earlier in the chapter, even a Home monopolist will behave in the same manner as a perfectly competitive industry under free trade, assuming that they have the same marginal costs. We also assume that any increase in the firm's output today leads to a reduction in costs in the future (i.e., a downward shift in the firm's average cost curve).

Equilibrium Today With free trade today, the Home firm faces the world price of  $P^W$  (which, you will recall from earlier in this chapter, is also its marginal revenue curve) and will produce to the point at which its marginal cost of production equals  $P^W$ . The Home firm therefore supplies the quantity  $S_1$ . To verify that  $S_1$  is actually the Home supply, however, we need to check that profits are not negative at this quantity. To do so, we compare the firm's average costs with the price. The average cost curve is shown as  $AC$  in panel (a), and at the supply of  $S_1$ , average costs are much higher than the price  $P^W$ . That means the Home firm is suffering losses and would shut down today instead of producing  $S_1$ .

# Tariff Equilibrium

To prevent the firm from shutting down, the Home government could apply an import tariff or quota to raise the Home price. Provided that the Home firm increases its output in response to this higher price, we assume that this increased size allows the firm to learn better production techniques so that its future costs are reduced. Given the choice of an import tariff or quota to achieve this goal, the Home government should

Infant Industry Protection In the situation today (panel a), the industry would produce  $S_{1}$ , the quantity at which  $MC = P^{W}$ . Because  $P^{W}$  is less than average costs at  $S_{1}$ , the industry would incur losses at the world price of  $P^{W}$  and would be forced to shut down. A tariff increases the price from  $P^{W}$  to  $P^{W} + t$ , allowing the industry to produce

(b) Future at  $S_{2}$  (and survive) with the net loss in welfare of  $(b + d)$ . In panel (b), producing today allows the average cost curve to fall through learning to  $AC'$ . In the future, the firm can produce the quantity  $S_{3}$  at the price  $P^{W}$  without tariff protection and earn producer surplus of  $e$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/22f5f01d3acf7a3d08de900d16f2d2278a7b146c3308f21c8111b5095abe1bf5.jpg)

definitely choose the tariff. The reason is that when a Home monopolist is faced with a quota rather than a tariff, it will produce less output under the quota so that it can further raise its price. The decrease in output leads to additional deadweight loss today, as discussed earlier in the chapter. Furthermore, because we have assumed that the firm's learning depends on how much it produces and output is lower under the quota, there would be less learning and a smaller reduction in future costs under a quota than a tariff. For both reasons, a tariff is a better policy than a quota when the goal is to nurture an infant industry.

Equilibrium Today If the government applies an import tariff of  $t$  dollars today, the Home price increases from  $P^W$  to  $P^W + t$ . We assume that the government sets the tariff high enough so that the new Home price,  $P^W + t$ , just covers the infant industry's average costs of production. At this new price, the firm produces the quantity  $S_2$  in panel (a). As illustrated, the price  $P^W + t$  exactly equals average costs,  $AC$ , at the quantity  $S_2$ , so the firm is making zero profits. Making zero profits means that the Home firm will continue to operate.

Equilibrium in the Future With the firm producing  $S_{2}$  today rather than  $S_{1}$ , it can learn about better production methods and lower its costs in the future. The effect of learning on production costs is shown by the downward shift of the average cost curve from  $AC$  in panel (a) to  $AC'$  in panel (b). The lower average costs in the future mean that the firm can produce quantity  $S_{3}$  without tariff protection at the world price  $P^{W}$ in panel (b) and still cover its average costs. We are assuming that the downward shift in the average cost curve is large enough that the firm can avoid losses at the world price  $P^W$ . If that is not the case—if the average cost curve  $AC'$  in panel (b) is above the world price  $P^W$ —then the firm would be unable to avoid losses in the future and the infant industry protection would not be successful. But if the temporary tariff today allows the firm to operate in the future without the tariff, then the infant industry protection has satisfied the first condition to be judged successful.

Effect of the Tariff on Welfare The application of the tariff today leads to a deadweight loss, and in panel (a), the deadweight loss is measured by the triangles  $(b + d)$ . But we also need to count the gain from having the firm operating in the future. In panel (b) of Figure 9-10, the producer surplus earned in the future by the firm is shown by the region  $e$ . We should think of the region  $e$  as the present value (i.e., the discounted sum over time) of the firm's future producer surplus; it is this amount that would be forgone if the firm shut down today. The second condition for the infant industry protection to be successful is that the deadweight loss  $(b + d)$  when the tariff is used should be less than the area  $e$ , which is present value of the firm's future produce surplus when it no longer needs the tariff.

To evaluate whether the tariff has been successful, it needs to satisfy both conditions: the firm has to be able to produce without losses and without needing the tariff in the future; and the future gains in producer surplus need to exceed the current deadweight loss from the tariff. To evaluate the second criterion, we need to compare the future gain of  $e$  with the deadweight loss today of  $(b + d)$ . If  $e$  exceeds  $(b + d)$ , then the infant industry protection has been worthwhile, but if  $e$  is less than  $(b + d)$ , then the costs of protection today do not justify the future benefits. The challenge for government policy is to try to distinguish worthwhile cases (those for which future benefits exceed present costs) from those cases that are not. In the application that follows, we will see whether the governments of China, Brazil, and the United States have been able to distinguish between these cases.

# APPLICATION

# Examples of Infant Industry Protection

There are many examples of infant industry protection in practice, and we will consider four: (1) policies used in the United States, Europe, and in China to support the solar panel industry; (2) a U.S. tariff imposed to protect Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the United States during the 1980s; (3) a complete ban on imports imposed from 1977 to the early 1990s to protect the computer industry in Brazil; and (4) tariffs and quotas imposed to protect the automobile industry in China, which were reduced when China joined the WTO in 2001.

# Government Policies in the Solar Panel Industry

Many countries subsidize the production or installation of photovoltaic cells (solar panels). In the United States, there are tax credits available to consumers who install solar panels on their home. This type of policy is common in other countries, too, and can be justified because the generation of electricity using solar panels does not lead to any pollution, in contrast to the generation of electricity by the burning of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil), which emits carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Earlier in this chapter we introduced the concept of an externality, which is an economic activity that imposes costs on other firms or consumers. Pollution is the leading example of an externality, and too much pollution will be emitted unless the government takes some action. Giving a subsidy to users of solar panels, because these households and businesses use less electricity from fossil fuels, is one way to limit the amount of pollution arising from electricity generation.

So subsidies for the use of solar panels are a way to correct an externality and, on their own, should not be viewed as a form of infant industry protection. But countries use other policies to encourage the production (not just the use) of solar panels in their own country. In the United States, the government gives tax breaks and low-interest loans or loan guarantees to companies that produce solar panels. One example of a loan guarantee was to the U.S. company Solyndra, which received a 535 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2009. The guarantee meant that the U.S. government would repay the loan if Solyndra could not, so that banks making loans to Solyndra did not face any risk. That policy can be viewed as a type of infant industry protection: giving the loan guarantee in the hope that the company will be profitable in the future. But Solyndra subsequently went bankrupt in 2011, and President Obama was widely criticized for this loan guarantee. This example illustrates how difficult it is to know whether a company protected by some form of infant industry protection will actually become profitable in the future, which is one of the conditions for the infant industry protection to be successful.

China has also pursued policies to encourage the production of solar panels, and especially to encourage their export. We discussed the use of export subsidies in China in an earlier application dealing with U.S. imports of solar panels from China. We discuss export subsidies in more detail in the next chapter, but for now you should think of them as similar to import tariffs: the export subsidy raises the price received by firms, just like an import tariff, and also carries a deadweight loss. So our discussion of infant industry protection applies equally well to export subsidies: these infant-industry policies are successful if (1) the industry becomes profitable in the future, after the export subsidy is removed; and (2) the deadweight loss of the subsidy is less than the future profits earned by the industry.

As we have already learned about the use of loan guarantees in the United States (where Solyndra went bankrupt), export subsidies also don't always work out as planned. In China, for example, the extensive use of subsidies led to vast overcapacity in the industry, which in turn led to the bankruptcy of the key Chinese firm, Suntech Power Holdings, whose main subsidiary in Beijing went bankrupt in March 2013. The Suntech-affiliated firms were named in the antidumping and countervailing duty case brought by the American companies in 2011 as having the lowest prices in the United States. The fact that some of these firms have gone bankrupt indicates that the Chinese export subsidies were not successful in leading them to be profitable. Other firms have survived and are still producing in China, but their exports to the United States are limited by the antidumping and countervailing duties now applied by the United States. Furthermore, the European Union is now contemplating stiff antidumping penalties against Chinese firms, as discussed in Headlines: Solar Flares. Ironically, the company in Europe calling for these duties is SolarWorld, whose U.S. subsidiary filed the trade case against Chinese exporters of solar panels in the United States. If these European duties are enacted, more Chinese firms could go bankrupt. For these various reasons, it appears that the Chinese subsidies to the solar panel industry have not been successful.

Still, we should recognize that this industry is still young and future years could bring further changes. Some experts believe that the industry might now migrate to Taiwan, where it would not face the U.S. tariffs applied against China. On the other hand, the Chinese industry itself will be helped by subsidies to the installation of solar panels in China, which the government is now starting to use rather than only relying on export subsidies. And in the United States and Europe, there are still a number of producers of solar panels, as well as a strong industry involved with the installation of either locally produced or imported panels, and this industry will continue to create demand for solar panels built in China or elsewhere in Asia. Given the state of the worldwide solar panel industry, it is too early to say for sure what the long-term impact of the U.S., European, and Chinese policies will be.

# U.S. Tariff on Heavyweight Motorcycles

Harley-Davidson does not really fit the usual description of an "infant" industry: the first plant opened in 1903 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and it was owned and operated by William Harley and the three Davidson brothers. Until the late 1970s it did not face intense import competition from Japanese producers; but by the early 1980s, Harley-Davidson was on the verge of bankruptcy. Even though it had been around since 1903, Harley-Davidson had many of the characteristics we associate with an infant industry: the inability to compete at the international price today and (as we will see) the potential for lower costs in the future. By including this case in our discussion of infant industries,

# Solar Flares

This article discusses the solar energy industry in Europe, and a recent proposal by the European Union to impose antidumping duties against China.

Four years ago, in the midst of Europe's solar energy boom, Wacker Chemie opened a new polysilicon factory in its sprawling chemicals facility in the small Bavarian town of Burghausen. There, in a production hall as large as an aircraft hangar but as clean as a laboratory, ultra-pure ingots of polysilicon—the most basic ingredient in photovoltaic cells—take shape in custom-built reactors heated to more than 1,000C. These days, the boom is over and Wacker's factory, with its 2,400 workers, is looking vulnerable. The company has been caught in what is shaping up to be a decisive trade fight between Europe and

China and Wacker executives are worried about collateral damage.

Last September the EU launched its biggest ever investigation, probing billions of euros of imports of Chinese solar equipment. This week Karel De Gucht, the EU trade commissioner, urged that provisional duties averaging 47 per cent be imposed on the country's exports of solar panels for dumping, or selling products below cost, in Europe. For Wacker, the fear is that such measures will backfire by pushing up solar equipment prices for consumers and further undermining an industry already under pressure in Europe. Adding to their unease is the likeli hood that Wacker will be first in line for Chinese retaliation. Late last year—just weeks after the EU opened its investigation—Beijing launched its own probe into Europe's polysilicon manufacturers. "This simply does not make sense," says Rudolf Staudigl, Wacker's chief executive, who is pleading with Brussels to hold fire. "If tariffs are implemented, Europe will be damaged more than China."

The case has risen to the highest political levels, with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, last year calling for a negotiated solution amid concerns that the confrontation could precipitate a full-blown trade war.

we are able to make a precise calculation of the effect of the tariffs on consumers and producers to determine whether the infant industry protection was successful.

In 1983 Harley-Davidson, the legendary U.S.-based motorcycle manufacturer, was in trouble. It was suffering losses due to a long period of lagging productivity combined with intense competition from Japanese producers. Two of these producers, Honda and Kawasaki, not only had plants in the United States but also exported Japan-made goods to the United States. Two other Japanese producers, Suzuki and Yamaha, produced and exported their products from Japan. In the early 1980s these four Japanese firms were engaged in a global price war that spilled over into the U.S. market, and inventories of imported heavyweight cycles rose dramatically in the United States. Facing this intense import competition, Harley-Davidson applied to the International Trade Commission (ITC) for Section 201 protection.

As required by law, the ITC engaged in a study to determine the source of injury to the industry, which in this case was identified as heavyweight (more than 700 cc) motorcycles. Among other factors, it studied the buildup of inventories by Japanese producers in the United States. The ITC determined that there was more than nine months' worth of inventory of Japanese motorcycles already in the United States, which could depress the prices of heavyweight cycles and threaten bankruptcy for Harley-Davidson. As a result, the ITC recommended to President Ronald Reagan that import protection be placed on imports of heavyweight motorcycles. This case is interesting because it is one of the few times that the  $\text{threat}$  of injury by imports has been used as a justification for tariffs under Section 201 of U.S. trade law.

President Reagan approved the recommendation from the ITC, and tariffs were imposed on imports of heavyweight motorcycles. These tariffs were initially very high, but they declined over five years. The initial tariff, imposed on April 16, 1983, was  $45\%$ ; it then fell annually to  $35\%$ ,  $20\%$ ,  $15\%$ , and  $10\%$  and was scheduled to end in April 1988. In fact, Harley-Davidson petitioned the ITC to end the tariff one year early, after the  $15\%$  rate expired in 1987, by which time it had cut costs and introduced new and very popular products so that profitability had been restored. Amid great fanfare, President Reagan visited the Harley-Davidson plant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and declared that the tariff had been a successful case of protection.

President Ronald Reagan visits the Harley-Davidson plant.

Calculation of Deadweight Loss Was the tariff on heavyweight motorcycles really successful? To answer this, we need to compare the deadweight loss of the tariff with the future gain in producer surplus. In our discussion of the steel tariff in the previous chapter, we derived a formula for the deadweight loss from using a tariff, measured relative to the import value:

$$
\frac {D W L}{P \cdot M} = \frac {1}{2} \cdot \left(\frac {t}{P ^ {W}}\right) \cdot \% \Delta M = \frac {1}{2} (0.45 \cdot 0.17) = 0.038, \text {or} 3.8 \%
$$

We can calculate the average import sales from 1982 to 1983 as  $(452 + 410) / 2 = \ {431}$  million. Multiplying the percentage loss by average imports, we obtain the deadweight loss in 1983 of  ${0.038} \times  {431} = \$  {16.3}  million. That deadweight loss is reported in the last column of Table 9-2, along with the loss for each following year. Adding up these deadweight losses, we obtain a total loss of 112.5 million over the four years that the tariff was used.[16]

Future Gain in Producer Surplus To judge whether the tariff was effective, we need to compare the deadweight loss of 112.5 million with the future gain in producer surplus (area e in Figure 9-10). How can we assess these future gains? We can use a technique that economists favor: we can evaluate the future gains in producer surplus by examining the stock market value of the firm around the time that the tariff was removed.

During the time that the tariff was in place, the management of Harley-Davidson reduced costs through several methods: implementing a "just-in-time" inventory system, which means producing inventory on demand rather than having excess amounts in warehouses; reducing the workforce (and its wages); and implementing "quality circles," groups of assembly workers who volunteer to meet together to discuss workplace improvements, along with a "statistical operator control system" that allowed employees to evaluate the quality of their output. Many of these production techniques were copied from Japanese firms. The company also introduced a new engine. These changes allowed Harley-Davidson to transform losses during the period from 1981 to 1982 into profits for 1983 and in following years.

In July 1986 Harley-Davidson became a public corporation and issued stock on the American Stock Exchange: 2 million shares at  \$11 per share, for a total offering of\$ 22 million. It also issued debt of \$70 million, which was to be repaid from future profits. In June 1987 it issued stock again: 1.23 million shares at \$16.50 per share, for a total offering of \$20.3 million. The sum of these stock and debt issues is \$112.3 million, which we can interpret as the present discounted value of the producer surplus of the firm. This estimate of area e is nearly equal to the consumer surplus loss,

\$112.5 million, in Table 9-2. Within a month after the second stock offering, however, the stock price rose from$ 16.50 to $19 per share. Using that price to evaluate the outstanding stock of 3.23 million, we obtain a stock value of  \$61 million, plus\$ 70 million in repaid debt, to obtain \$131 million as the future producer surplus.

By this calculation, the future gain in producer surplus from tariff protection to Harley-Davidson ( \$131 million) exceeds the deadweight loss of the tariff (\$ 112.5 million). Furthermore, since 1987 Harley-Davidson has become an even more successful company. Its sales and profits have grown every year, and many model changes have been introduced, so it is now the Japanese companies that copy Harley-Davidson. By March 2005 Harley-Davidson had actually surpassed General Motors in its stock market value:  \$17.7 billion versus\$ 16.2 billion. Both of these companies suffered losses during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, but Harley-Davidson continued to operate as usual (with a stock market value of \$4.3 billion in mid-2009), whereas General Motors declared bankruptcy and required a government bailout (its stock market value fell to less than \$0.5 billion). Although both companies can be expected to recover after the crisis, it is clear that General Motors—which once had the world's highest stock market value—has been surpassed by Harley-Davidson.

Was Protection Successful? Does this calculation mean that the infant industry protection was successful? A complete answer to that question involves knowing what would have happened if the tariff had not been put in place. When we say that infant industry protection is successful if the area  $e$  of future producer surplus gain ( \$131 million) exceeds the deadweight loss (\$ 112.5 million), we are assuming that the firm would not have survived at all without the tariff protection. That assumption may be true for Harley-Davidson. It is well documented that Harley-Davidson was on the brink of bankruptcy from 1982 to 1983. Citibank had decided that it would not extend more loans to cover Harley's losses, and Harley found alternative financing on December 31, 1985, just one week before filing for bankruptcy.[17] If the tariff saved the company, then this was clearly a case of successful infant industry protection.

On the other hand, even if Harley-Davidson had not received the tariff and had filed for bankruptcy, it might still have emerged to prosper again. Bankruptcy does not mean that a firm stops producing; it just means that the firm's assets are used to repay all possible debts. Even if Harley-Davidson had gone bankrupt without the tariff, some or all of the future gains in producer surplus might have been realized. So we cannot be certain whether the turnaround of Harley-Davidson required the use of the tariff.[18]

Despite all these uncertainties, it still appears that the tariff on heavyweight motorcycles bought Harley-Davidson some breathing room. This is the view expressed by the chief economist at the ITC at that time, in the quotation at the beginning of the chapter: "If the case of heavyweight motorcycles is to be considered the only successful escape-clause [tariff], it is because it caused little harm and it helped Harley-Davidson get a bank loan so it could diversify."19 We agree with this assessment that the harm caused by the tariff was small compared with the potential benefits of avoiding bankruptcy, which allowed Harley-Davidson to become the very successful company that it is today.

# Computers in Brazil

There are many cases in which infant industry protection has not been successful. One well-known case involves the computer industry in Brazil. In 1977 the Brazilian government began a program to protect domestic firms involved in the production of personal computers (PCs). It was thought that achieving national autonomy in the computer industry was essential for strategic military reasons. Not only were imports of PCs banned, but domestic firms also had to buy from local suppliers whenever possible, and foreign producers of PCs were not allowed to operate in Brazil.

The Brazilian ban on imports lasted from 1977 to the early 1990s. This was a period of rapid innovations in PC production worldwide, with large drops in the cost of computing power. In Figure 9-11, we show the effective price of computing power in the United States and Brazil between 1982 and 1992, which fell very rapidly in both countries. The price we are graphing is "effective" because it is not just the retail price of a new PC but a price index that reflects the improvements over time in the PC's speed of calculations, storage capacity, and so on.

FIGURE 9-11

Computer Prices in the United States and Brazil, 1982-1992 This diagram shows the effective price of computer power in the United States and Brazil. Both prices fell very rapidly because of technological improvements, but the drop in the U.S. price exceeded that of the Brazilian price. The difference between the two prices is a measure of the technology gap between Brazil and the United States in the production of personal computers.

Prices in Brazil Brazilian firms were adept at reverse engineering the IBM PCs being sold from the United States. But the reverse engineering took time, and the fact that Brazilian firms were required to use local suppliers for many parts within the computers added to the costs of production. We can see from Figure 9-11 that Brazil never achieved the same low prices as the United States. By 1992, for example, the effective prices in Brazil were between the prices that had been achieved in the United States four or five years earlier. The persistent gap between the prices in Brazil and the United States means that Brazil was never able to produce computers at competitive prices without tariff protection. This fact alone means that the infant industry protection was not successful.

Consumer and Producer Surplus In Table 9-3, we show the welfare calculation for Brazil, as well as other details of the PC industry. Local sales peaked at about  \$750 million in 1986, and the following year, the Brazilian prices rose to within 20\%$  of those in the United States. But that is as close as the Brazilian industry ever got to world prices. In 1984 prices in Brazil were nearly double those in the United States, which led to a producer surplus gain of 29 million but a consumer surplus loss in Brazil of \$80 million. The net loss was therefore \$80 million – \$29 million = \$51 million, which was  $0.02\%$  of Brazilian gross domestic product (GDP) that year. By 1986 the net loss had grown to \$164 million, or  $0.06\%$  of GDP. This net loss was the deadweight loss from the tariff during the years it was in place. The industry was never able to produce in the absence of tariffs, so there are no future gains (like area  $e$  in Figure 9-10) that we can count against those losses.

Other Losses The higher prices in Brazil imposed costs on Brazilian industries that relied on computers in manufacturing, as well as on individual users, and they became increasingly dissatisfied with the government's policy. During his campaign in 1990, President Fernando Collor de Mello promised to abolish the infant industry protection for personal computers, which he did immediately after he was elected.

A number of reasons have been given for the failure of this policy to develop an efficient industry in Brazil: imported materials such as silicon chips were expensive to obtain, as were domestically produced parts that local firms were required to use; in addition, local regulations limited the entry of new firms into the industry. Whatever

# Protecting the Automobile Industry in China

The final example of infant industry protection that we discuss involves the automobile industry in China. In 2009, China overtook the United States as the largest automobile market in the world (measured by domestic sales plus imports). Strong competition among foreign firms located in China, local producers, and import sales have resulted in new models and falling prices so that the Chinese middle class can now afford to buy automobiles. In 2009, there were over 13 million vehicles sold in China, as compared with 10.4 million cars and light trucks sold in the United States. Four years later in 2013, the Chinese industry is poised to reach another milestone by producing more cars than Europe, as described in Headlines: Milestone for China Car Output.

Growth in automotive production and sales has been particularly strong since 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). With its accession to the WTO, China agreed to reduce its tariffs on foreign autos, which were as high as  $260\%$  in the early 1980s, then fell from  $80\%$  to  $100\%$  by 1996, and  $25\%$  by July 2006. The tariff on automobile parts was further cut from  $25\%$  to  $10\%$  in 2009. China has loosened its import quotas, as well. Those tariffs and quotas, in addition to restrictions at the province and city level on what type of cars could be sold, had limited China's imports and put a damper on the auto industry in that country. Prices were high and foreign producers were reluctant to sell their newest models to China. That situation has changed dramatically. Now, foreign firms scramble to compete in China with their latest designs and are even making plans to export cars from China. Is the Chinese automobile industry a successful case of infant industry protection? Are the benefits

# HEADLINES

# Milestone for China Car Output

China is poised to produce more cars than Europe in 2013 for the first time, hitting a landmark in the country's rise in the automobile industry and underlining the difficulties for the European vehicle sector as it faces a challenging 12 months. China is in 2013 set to make 19.6 million cars and other light vehicles such as small trucks compared with 18.3 million in Europe … In 2012, on the basis of motor industry estimates, Europe made

18.9 million cars and related vehicles, comfortably ahead of China's tally of 17.8 million… . With global sales valued at about 1.3 trillion a year, the car industry is one of the best bellwethers of world economic conditions.

According to the data, Europe will in 2013 make just over a fifth of the world's cars—a figure that is well down on the 35 per cent it recorded in 2001. In 1970 nearly one in every two cars made in the world originated from a factory in Europe—which is generally recognized as the place where the global auto industry began with the unveiling of a rudimentary three-wheeler in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz. Car production in China in 2013 is likely to be 10 times higher than in 2000—when its share of global auto manufacturing was just 3.5 per cent as opposed to a likely 23.8 per cent in 2013.

gained by the current production and export of cars greater than the costs of the tariffs and quotas imposed in the past? To answer this, we begin by briefly describing the history of the Chinese auto industry.

Production in China Beginning in the early 1980s, China permitted a number of joint ventures between foreign firms and local Chinese partners. The first of these in 1983 was Beijing Jeep, which was a joint venture between American Motors Corporation (AMC—later acquired by Chrysler Corporation) and a local firm in Beijing. The following year, Germany's Volkswagen signed a 25-year contract to make passenger cars in Shanghai, and France's Peugeot agreed to another passenger car project to make vehicles in Guangzhou.

Although joint venture agreements provided a window for foreign manufacturers to tap the

China market, there were limits on their participation. Foreign manufacturers could not own a majority stake in a manufacturing plant—Volkswagen's venture took the maximum of  $50\%$  foreign ownership. The Chinese also kept control of distribution networks for the jointly produced automobiles. These various regulations, combined with high tariff duties, helped at least some of the new joint ventures achieve success. Volkswagen's Shanghai plant was by the far the winner under these rules, and it produced more than 200,000 vehicles per year by the late 1990s, more than twice as many as any other plant. Volkswagen's success was also aided by some Shanghai municipal efforts. Various restrictions on engine size, as well as incentives offered to city taxi companies that bought Volkswagen, helped ensure that only Volkswagen's models could be sold in the Shanghai market; essentially, the Shanghai Volkswagen plant had a local monopoly.

That local monopoly has been eroded by entry into the Shanghai market, however. A recent example occurred in early 2009, when General Motors opened two new plants in Shanghai, at a cost of  \$1.5 billion and\$ 2.5 billion each. General Motors is a leading producer in China, and locally produced 1.8 million of the 13 million vehicles sold in China in 2009. In fact, its profits from the Chinese market were the only bright spot on its global balance sheet that year, and served to offset some of its losses in the American market, as described in Headlines: Shanghai Tie-Up Drives Profits for GM.

Cost to Consumers The tariffs and quotas used in China kept imports fairly low throughout the 1990s, ranging from a high of 222,000 cars imported in 1993 to a low of 27,500 imports in 1998 and 160,000 cars in 2005. Since tariffs were in the range of  $80\%$  to  $100\%$  by 1996, import prices were approximately doubled because of the tariffs. But the quotas imposed on auto imports probably had at least as great an impact on prices of imports and domestically produced cars. Our analysis earlier in the chapter showed that quotas have a particularly large impact on domestic prices when the Home firm is a monopoly. That situation applied to the sales of Volkswagen's joint venture in Shanghai, which enjoyed a local monopoly on the sales of its vehicles.

# Shanghai Tie-Up Drives Profits for GM

This article discusses how partnerships in China have helped GM's profits.

If General Motors believes in God, it must be thanking Him right now for China.

Mainland Chinese sales were by far the brightest spot in GM's universe last year: sales in China rose 66 per cent while US sales fell by 30 per cent. One in four GM cars is now made in China. Even those cars made in Detroit were partly designed in Shanghai. GM managed to offload distressed assets to Chinese companies: the loss-making, environment-harming Hummer was sold to a previously unknown heavy equipment manufacturer, Sichuan Tengzhong

[this sale was, however, blocked by the Chinese government in February 2010], and Beijing Automotive (BAIC) took some Saab technology off GM's hands. Perhaps most importantly of all, though, China agreed last year to bankroll GM's expansion in Asia.

In exchange for a deal to sell Chinese minicommercial vehicles in India, GM agreed to give up the 50-50 ownership of its leading mainland joint venture, Shanghai General Motors, ceding 51 percent majority control to its Chinese partner, Shanghai Automotive Industry

Corp (SAIC). The Sino-American partnership said this would be only the first of many such deals. Will observers one day look back at that deal and say that was the day GM signed over its future to the Chinese? And does that deal demonstrate how China can save GM—or hint that it might gobble it up? "The quick answer is that Chinese consumers have already saved GM," says Klaus Paur of TNS auto consultancy in Shanghai, referring to stratospheric Chinese auto sales last year.

The effect of this local monopoly was to substantially increase prices in the Shanghai market. In Figure 9-12, we show the estimated markups of price over marginal costs for autos sold in China from 1995 to 2001, by various producers. The markups for Shanghai Volkswagen are the highest, reaching a high of  $54\%$  in 1998 and then falling to  $28\%$  in 2001, for an average of  $42\%$  for the period from 1995 to 2001. In comparison, the average markup charged by Tianjin Auto was  $19\%$ , and the average markup charged by Shanghai GM was  $14\%$ . All the other producers shown in Figure 9-12 have even lower markups.

From this evidence, it is clear that Shanghai Volkswagen was able to substantially raise its prices because of the monopoly power granted by the local government. Furthermore, the Jetta and Audi models produced by Shanghai Volkswagen during the 1990s were outdated models. That plant had the highest production through 2001, despite its high prices and outdated models, so a large number of consumers in the Shanghai area and beyond bore the costs of that local protection. This example illustrates how a Home monopoly can gain from protection at the expense of consumers. The example also illustrates how protection can stifle the incentive for firms to introduce the newest models and production techniques.

Gains to Producers For the tariffs and quotas used in China to be justified as infant industry protection, they should lead to a large enough drop in future costs so that the protection is no longer needed. China has not reached that point entirely, since it still imposes a tariff of  $25\%$  on autos, and a  $10\%$  tariff on auto parts. These tariff rates are much lower than in the past but still substantially protect the local market. So it is premature to point to the Chinese auto industry as a successful case of infant industry protection. Still, there are some important lessons that can be

learned from its experience. First, there is no doubt that past protection contributed to the inflow of foreign firms to the Chinese market. All the foreign auto companies that entered China prior to its WTO accession in 2001 did so under high levels of protection, so that acquiring a local partner was the only way to sell locally: tariffs were too high to allow significant imports to China. As a result, local costs fell as Chinese partners gained from the technology transferred to them by their foreign partners. We can conclude that tariff protection combined with the ownership restrictions for joint ventures has led to a great deal of learning and reduced costs by the Chinese partners.

Second, at least as important as the tariffs themselves is the rapid growth of income in China, which has led to a boom in domestic sales. It is that rapid growth in income that has led China to overtake the United States to become the largest automobile market in the world measured by sales in 2009, and with production exceeding that of Europe in 2013. Tariffs have contributed to the inflow of foreign investment, but it is now the consumers in China who are forcing firms to offer the newest models built with the most efficient techniques. For now, we must leave open the question of whether the high tariffs and quotas in China are responsible for the current success of its auto industry, or whether they just resulted in high prices and lagging model designs that slowed the development of the industry. It will be some years before researchers can look back at the development of this industry and identify the specific causes of its success.

# 6 Conclusions

In the previous chapter, we discussed the use of import tariffs and quotas under perfect competition and highlighted the difference between the small-country and large-country cases. With perfect competition, a small importing country loses from a tariff (because it cannot affect world prices), but the large importing country can potentially gain from a tariff (because the tariff depresses the world price). Import quotas have effects similar to those of import tariffs under perfect competition, so we often refer to quotas and tariffs as "equivalent."

We can contrast the results obtained under perfect competition with the results we learned in this chapter, in which we assume imperfect competition—either Home or Foreign monopoly. Under Home monopoly, the effects of a tariff and quota are very different. With a tariff, the Home monopolist can increase its price by the amount of the tariff (as would a competitive industry) but cannot exercise its monopoly power. With an import quota, however, the Home firm is able to charge a higher price than it could with a tariff because it enjoys a "sheltered" market. So the import quota leads to higher costs for Home consumers than the tariff, and these two policies are no longer "equivalent," as they are under perfect competition.

Under Foreign monopoly, the results are similar to those of the large-country case analyzed in the previous chapter: the tariff leads to a fall in the price received by the Foreign monopolist, so the price paid by Home consumers rises by less than the full amount of the tariff. The tariff is shared between an increase in the Home price and a decrease in the Foreign price, and the Home importer obtains a terms-of-trade gain. For small tariffs, the terms-of-trade gain exceeds the deadweight loss, and the Home country gains from the tariff. So this is a case where the use of a tariff as strategic trade policy can benefit the Home country, but at the expense of the Foreign firm.

A specific example of a tariff applied against a Foreign monopoly occurs when the Foreign firm is a discriminating monopoly and it dumps its output into Home at a lower price than it charges in its own local market. When dumping occurs, the importing country is permitted by WTO rules to respond with a tariff, which is called an antidumping duty. In principle, we might expect Home to gain from the duty because the Foreign firm will lower its price (as occurs for a tariff applied against a Foreign monopolist). But we have argued that the potential for Home gains from the antidumping duty are unlikely to arise because of special features in the way these duties are applied. Instead, the expected outcome from antidumping duties is that Foreign exporters raise prices even when a duty is not applied, leading to Home losses. Because of these losses, the use of antidumping duties as strategic trade policy is not effective.

Another topic discussed in this chapter is the infant industry case for protection. We studied four industries as examples of infant industry protection: solar panels in the United States and China, Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the United States, computers in Brazil, and automobiles in China. Both the United States and China provide various type of subsidies for the production or use of solar panels, and the United States has recently applied antidumping and countervailing duties on these imports from China. The solar panel industry is suffering from overcapacity on a global scale and firms in both countries have gone bankrupt. So the policies applied have not yet led to the long-term profitability of firms in either country. The tariff given to protect Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the United States during the 1980s appears to have been successful because Harley-Davidson survived and has become very profitable. For computers in Brazil, the ban on imports during the 1980s was not successful because the industry was never able to learn enough from the world leaders to reach the same level of efficiency and competitive prices. Finally, automobile production in China has grown rapidly and overtaken production in Europe, but it is still protected by a  $25\%$  tariff, so it is too early to judge whether this is a successful case of infant industry protection. In addition, the rapid growth in the domestic income of Chinese consumers has been at least as important as past tariffs to the recent growth in production and sales.

# KEY POINTS

1. Free trade will lead a Home monopoly in a small country to act in the same way as a perfectly competitive industry and charge a price equal to marginal cost. Therefore, competition from imports eliminates the monopoly power of the Home firm.
2. Quotas are not equivalent to tariffs when the Home firm is a monopolist. Because a quota limits the number of imports, the Home monopolist can charge higher prices than under a tariff, which results in greater costs to consumers.
3. When a tariff is applied against a Foreign monopolist, the results are similar to those of the large-country case analyzed in the previous chapter: the Foreign monopolist increases the price in the importing country by less than the full amount of the tariff and allows its own net-of-tariff price to fall. Hence, the tariff is shared between an increase in the Home price and a decrease in the Foreign price, a terms-of-trade gain for Home.
4. Dumping is the practice of a Foreign firm exporting goods at a price that is below its own domestic price or below its average cost of production. If the price charged for the exported good is above the firm's marginal cost, then dumping is profitable. We expect to observe dumping when the Foreign firm is acting like a discriminating monopolist.
5. Countries respond to dumping by imposing antidumping duties on imports. Antidumping duties are calculated as the difference between a Foreign firm's local price (or average costs) and its export price. To reduce or avoid the antidumping duties, Foreign firms can raise their export prices. That increase in price is a terms-of-trade loss for the importer and occurs because the Foreign firm can influence the duty.
6. In the United States and other countries, the use of antidumping tariffs far exceeds the use of safeguard tariffs. It is easy for domestic firms to bring a charge of dumping, and in many cases upholding the charge results in an increase in foreign prices and a decrease in competition for the domestic firm. The excessive use of antidumping cases also invites other countries to respond with their own charges of dumping.
7. An infant industry is a firm that requires protection to compete at world prices today. When a government applies a temporary tariff, it expects that costs for the firm or the industry overall will fall due to learning, thereby allowing it to compete at world prices in the future.

# PROBLEMS

1. Figure 9-1 shows the Home no-trade equilibrium under perfect competition (with the price  $P^{C}$ ) and under monopoly (with the price  $P^{M}$ ). In this problem, we compare the welfare of Home consumers in these two situations.

a. Under perfect competition, with the price  $P^C$ , label the triangle of consumer surplus and the triangle of producer surplus. Outline the area of total Home surplus (the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus).

b. Under monopoly, with the price  $P^M$ , label the consumer surplus triangle.

c. Producer surplus is the same as the profits earned by the monopolist. To measure this, label the point in Figure 9-1 where the  $MR$  curve intersects  $MC$  at point  $B'$ . For selling the units between zero and  $Q^M$ , marginal costs rise along the  $MC$  curve, up to  $B'$ . The monopolist earns the difference between the price  $P^M$  and  $MC$  for each unit sold. Label the difference between the price and the  $MC$  curve as producer surplus, or profits.

d. Outline the area of total Home surplus with a Home monopoly.

e. Compare your answers to parts (a) and (d), and outline what the difference between these two areas is. What is this difference called and why?

2. Figure 9-2 shows the free-trade equilibrium under perfect competition and under monopoly (both with the price  $P^W$ ). In this problem, we compare the welfare of Home consumers in the no-trade situation and under free trade.

a. Under perfect competition, with the price  $P^{W}$ , label the triangle of consumer surplus and the triangle of producer surplus. Outline the area of total Home surplus (the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus).

b. Based on your answers to part (a) in this problem and part (a) of the last problem, outline the area of gains from free trade under perfect competition.

c. Under monopoly, still with the price  $P^{W}$ , again label the triangle of consumer surplus and the triangle of producer surplus.

d. Based on your answers to part (c) in this problem and part (d) in the last problem, outline the area of gains from free trade under Home monopoly.

e. Compare your answers to parts (b) and (d). That is, which area of gains from trade is higher and why?

3. Rank the following in ascending order of Home welfare and justify your answers. If two items are equivalent, indicate this accordingly.

a. Tariff  $t$  in a small country with perfect competition b. Tariff  $t$  in a small country with a Home monopoly

c. Quota with the same imports  $M$  in a small country, with a Home monopoly d. Tariff  $t$  in a country facing a Foreign monopoly

4. Refer to the prices of Japanese auto imports under the VER (Figure 9-5) and answer the following: a. What component of the price of imported automobiles from Japan rose the most over the period 1980 to 1985?

b. Sketch how Figures 9-5 and 9-6 might have looked if the United States had applied a tariff to Japanese auto imports instead of the VER (with the same level of imports). In words, discuss how the import prices and U.S. prices might have compared under a tariff and the VER.

c. Which policy—a tariff or the VER—would have been least costly to U.S. consumers?

5. In this problem, we analyze the effects of an import quota applied by a country facing a Foreign monopolist. In Figure 9-7, suppose that the Home country applies an import quota of  $X_{2}$ , meaning that the Foreign firm cannot sell any more than that amount.

a. To achieve export sales of  $X_{2}$ , what is the highest price that the Foreign firm can charge?

b. At the price you have identified in part (a), what is the Home consumer surplus?

c. Compare the consumer surplus you identify in part (b) with the consumer surplus under free trade. Therefore, outline in Figure 9-7 the Home losses due to the quota. Hint: Remember that there is no Home firm, so you do not need to take into account Home producer surplus or tariff revenue. Assume that quota rents go to Foreign firms.

d. Based on your answer to (c), which has the greater loss to the Home country—a tariff or a quota, leading to the same level of sales  $X_{2}$  by the Foreign firm?

6. Suppose that the demand curve for a good is represented by the straight line

$$
P = 1 0 - Q
$$

Fill in the missing information in the following chart:

<table><tr><td>Quantity</td><td>Price</td><td>Total Revenue</td><td>Marginal Revenue</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td></td><td></td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table> a.

b. Is the marginal revenue curve a straight line as well? What is the slope of the marginal revenue curve? How does that slope compare with that of the demand curve?

c. Does the marginal revenue curve contain negative values over the specified range of quantities? Explain why or why not.

7. Consider the case of a Foreign monopoly with no Home production, shown in Figure 9-7. Starting from free trade at point A, consider a \10 tariff applied by the Home government.

a. If the demand curve is linear, as in Problem 6, what is the shape of the marginal revenue curve?

b. How much does the tariff-inclusive Home price increase because of the tariff, and how much does the net-of-tariff price received by the Foreign firm fall?

c. Discuss the welfare effects of implementing the tariff. Use a graph to illustrate under what conditions, if any, there is an increase in Home welfare.

8. Suppose the Home firm is considering whether to enter the Foreign market. Assume that the Home firm has the following costs and demand:

Fixed costs = 140

Marginal costs = 10 per unit

Local price = 25

Local quantity 20

Export price = 15

Export quantity 10 a. Calculate the firm's total costs from selling only in the local market.

b. What is the firm's average cost from selling only in the local market?

c. Calculate the firm's profit from selling only in the local market.

d. Should the Home firm enter the Foreign market? Briefly explain why.

e. Calculate the firm's profit from selling to both markets.

f. Is the Home firm dumping? Briefly explain.

9. Suppose that in response to a threatened antidumping duty of  $t$ , the Foreign monopoly raises its price by the amount  $t$ .

a. Illustrate the losses for the Home country.

b. How do these losses compare with the losses from a safeguard tariff of the amount  $t$ , applied by the Home country against the Foreign monopolist?

c. In view of your answers to (a) and (b), why are antidumping cases filed so often?

10. Why is it necessary to use a market failure to justify the use of infant industry protection?
11. What is a positive externality? Explain the argument of knowledge spillovers as a potential reason for infant industry protection.
12. If infant industry protection is justified, is it better for the Home country to use a tariff or a quota, and why?
13. Figures A, B, and C are taken from a paper by Chad Bown: "The Pattern of Antidumping and Other Types of Contingent Protection" (World Bank, PREM Notes No. 144, October 21, 2009), and updated from Chad Bown, 2012, "Global Antidumping Database," available at http://econ.worldbank.org/ttbd/ a. Figure A shows the number of newly initiated trade remedy investigations, including safeguard (SF), China safeguard (CSF), antidumping (AD), and countervailing duty (CVD) (a countervailing duty is used when foreign firms receive a subsidy from their government, and then the CVD prevents them from charging lower prices in the importing country). Each bar shows the number of new cases in each quarter of the year (Q1, Q2, etc.) for 2007 through Q1 of 2012. The number of cases is graphed separately for developing countries and developed countries. What does this graph tell us about what has happened to the number of such cases since 2007? What might have caused this pattern?

b. Figure B shows the number of safeguard (SF) tariff initiations by WTO members. Since 1995 what three years saw the largest numbers of safeguards? What might explain these increases? (Hint: Consider the U.S. business cycle over these years.) c. According to Figure B, year 2002 had the most safeguard actions by WTO members. How many action were started that year, and what U.S. safeguard case that year was discussed in this chapter?

d. Figure C shows the number of newly initiated antidumping (AD) investigations, for quarters of the year from 2007 through Q1 of 2012. Compare the number of cases in this graph with Figure A, which included safeguard (SF), China safeguard (CSF), antidumping (AD), and countervailing duty (CVD). What can you conclude about the total number of SF, CSF, and CVD cases as compared with the number of AD cases?

# Export Policies in Resource and High-Technology Industries

The Middle East has its oil, China has rare earth.

Deng Xiaoping, architect of China's economic reforms, Southern Tour of China, 1992

After more than a decade, the Doba round of global trade talks finally produced a deal. The package agreed to in Bali on Saturday [December 7, 2013] is significantly less ambitious than what the representatives who convened in [Doba,] Qatar in 2001 had in mind … With developing and rich countries at loggerbeads over sensitive topics such as agricultural duties, the World Trade Organization built around a package of "trade facilitation" measures that could be more easily agreed upon.

Financial Times, editorial, December 9, 2013, p.10.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/8ad4f78940870b5ece7a1a3e91b65e56f1a020b4d12ee15bc0949b3b0a346a30.jpg)

In July 21, 2008, representatives of the 152 countries belonging to the World Trade Organization (WTO) met in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss reforms of the world trading system. Like earlier meetings in Seattle (1999), Cancún, Mexico (2003), and Hong Kong (2005), this meeting was marked by large-scale protests. Groups including farmers from South Korea and fishermen from the Philippines objected to the impact that agricultural reforms could have on lowering food prices, thereby threatening their livelihoods. Farmers in South Korea, along with those in Japan, Europe, and the United States, benefit from an intricate system of tariffs (taxes on imports) and subsidies (payments to exporters) that keeps prices for their crops high but in some cases lowers prices in the rest of the world. The lower world price hurts farmers in land-rich developing countries such as Brazil, India, China, and some African nations by making it harder for them to export their own agricultural products. On the other hand, the lower world prices are a benefit to land-poor developing countries that must import agricultural products. Consumers in those countries will be hurt if prices end up rising as a result of agricultural reforms in the WTO.

The first goal of this chapter is to explain subsidy policies that affect resource-based industries (such as agriculture, mining, and fuel production) and high-tech industries.

Police fight rioters outside the World Trade Organization's meeting. Most of the protesters were South Korean farmers worried about rice imports.

The primary reason that countries subsidize exports is political, but there are other reasons as well. For example, agricultural subsidies benefit a group in society (such as farmers) that the government wants to support. Such subsidies occur in the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and many other countries. Because these subsidies are costly to the governments of these countries and because they harm exporters from land-rich developing countries, many countries attending the Doha Round of WTO negotiations (2001-present) advocated for the removal of agricultural subsidies. In exchange for the removal of subsidies, it was expected that land-poor developing countries would lower their tariffs on agricultural goods. This complex negotiation (which involved agriculture in many countries) ultimately failed, and the 2008 Geneva meeting of the Doha Round broke up without agreement. More recently, in December 2013 a much smaller deal to streamline customs procedures was agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, but without agreement on agricultural subsidies, as indicated in the quote at the beginning of the chapter. In this chapter, we describe the tentative agreements to reduce agricultural subsidies made at the 2005 Hong Kong meeting of the WTO, and the issues that could not be resolved which led to the breakup of the 2008 Geneva meeting.

Export subsidies are not the only kind of policy that is used to influence trade in resource-based industries such as agriculture, mining, and fuel extraction. The second goal of this chapter is to explain the effect of two policies, export tariffs and export quotas, on the countries that use them. To raise government revenue, some countries impose export tariffs, taxes applied by the exporting country when a good leaves the country.[2] Argentina, for example, charges export tariffs on many agricultural and resource exports. In 2011 the tariffs were  $35\%$  on soybeans,  $30\%$  on sunflower meal and oil,  $23\%$  on wheat,  $20\%$  on corn, and  $20\%$  on biodiesel (vegetable oil-based diesel fuel). Another trade policy that can sometimes benefit companies is an export quota, a restriction on the amount that producers are allowed to export. China, for example, applied quotas on firms exporting "rare earth" minerals in 2011 and 2012, which led to a substantial increase in the price of these minerals.

The third goal of the chapter is to examine how governments can strategically use export subsidies to bolster domestic companies and industries. Instead of being used to support a particular industry or to raise revenue for the government, some subsidies are meant to give a domestic industry a strategic advantage in international competition. Some high-technology industries, such as Airbus in Europe and Boeing in the United States, receive generous government subsidies, which often leads to political friction. Legislators often believe that subsidies to high-tech industries will raise those industries' profits and benefit the exporting country.

In this chapter, we assess the arguments for and against the various export policies by examining their effects on prices, the amount of trade, and welfare.

# 1 WTO Goals on Agricultural Export Subsidies

In Table 10-1, we describe the agreements made at the Hong Kong meeting of the WTO in December 2005. These agreements were never ratified by the legislatures in the countries involved, however, so it is best to think of them as goals that have not yet been achieved rather than definite outcomes. Four of the items deal with agricultural subsidies and tariffs, which were the focus of that meeting.

# Agricultural Export Subsidies

An export subsidy is payment to firms for every unit exported (either a fixed amount or a fraction of the sales price). Governments give subsidies to encourage domestic

# TABLE 10-1

Agreements Made at the Hong Kong WTO Meeting, December 2005 This table shows the agreements made at the 2005 WTO meeting in Hong Kong, which had as its major focus the subsidies provided to agricultural products. This meeting was part of the Doha Round of WTO negotiations, which have not yet been concluded.

<table><tr><td>Issue</td><td>Decision Made in Hong Kong</td><td>Unresolved in Hong Kong</td></tr><tr><td>Agricultural export subsidies</td><td>Abolition by end of 2013, with a &quot;substantial part&quot; scrapped before 2011, and parallel elimination of indirect subsidies.</td><td>Must agree [on] value of indirect subsidies and detailed phase-out programs.</td></tr><tr><td>Domestic farm supports</td><td>Agreement to classify WTO members in three bands based on their level of domestic farm support (top—European Union, middle—United States and Japan, bottom—everyone else).</td><td>Must agree [on] size of subsidy reduction and rules to stop countries from shifting trade-distorting subsidies into categories sheltered from deep cuts.</td></tr><tr><td>Agricultural tariffs</td><td>Agreement on four tiers (different for rich and poor countries) and on a mechanism allowing poor nations to raise duties to counter import surges.</td><td>Must decide size of tariff cuts and number and treatment of &quot;sensitive&quot; and &quot;special&quot; products.</td></tr><tr><td>Cotton Agreement</td><td>Agreement to eliminate export subsidies in 2006 and grant unrestricted access for cotton exports from West African producers and other least developed countries (LDCs).</td><td>United States will have the &quot;objective&quot; of cutting its 4 billion subsidies to cotton growers further and faster than the still-to-be-agreed-upon overall reduction for domestic farm supports.</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial goods</td><td>Agreement on formula and on a &quot;comparably high level of ambition&quot; for tariff cuts in agriculture and industrial goods so rich nations do not demand more cuts than they give.</td><td>Must agree [on] key elements of formula, how much to cut, flexibilities for developing countries, and role of sectoral negotiations.</td></tr><tr><td>Services</td><td>Some negotiating guidelines for trade in services agreed upon …</td><td>The European Union is pressing for liberal-ization timing targets opposed by developing countries; poor nations want rich ones to accept more temporary service workers.</td></tr><tr><td>Development</td><td>Duty-free, quota-free access extended to 97\% of product[s] … from least developed countries by 2008, allowing significant exclusions (e.g., U.S. textiles imports). More pledges of aid for trade.</td><td>Must agree [on] other measures to strengthen special treatment provisions for poor countries.</td></tr></table> firms to produce more in particular industries. As shown in Table 10-1, the member countries of the WTO agreed to abolish all export subsidies in agriculture by the end of 2013, though as mentioned above, this goal has not yet been achieved. Some agricultural exporters, such as Brazil, India, and China, had pushed for an earlier end to the subsidies but faced stiff opposition from many European countries. Europe maintains a system of agricultural subsidies known as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). For example, to help its sugar growers, the CAP pays farmers up to 50 euros per ton of harvested sugar beets, which is five times the world market price. Because of the subsidy, European farmers can afford to sell the sugar made from their sugar beets at a much lower price than the world market price. As a result, the sugar beet subsidy makes Europe a leading supplier of sugar worldwide, even though countries in more temperate or tropical climates have a natural comparative advantage. Other countries maintain agricultural subsidies that are just as generous. The United States, for example, pays cotton farmers to grow more cotton and then subsidizes agribusiness and manufacturers to buy the American cotton, so both the production and the sale of cotton receive subsidies. Japan allows  $10\%$  of the approximately 7 million tons of milled rice it consumes annually to enter into the country tariff-free but imposes a  $500\%$  tariff on any rice in excess of this  $10\%$  limit. There are many other examples of agricultural protection like this from countries all over the world.

Indirect Subsidies Included in the Hong Kong export subsidy agreement is the parallel elimination of indirect subsidies to agriculture, including food aid from developed to poor countries and other exports by state-sponsored trading companies in advanced countries. Europe has already eliminated its food aid subsidies and argues that cash aid to poor countries is much more effective; the United States continues to export agricultural commodities as aid. Later in the chapter, we explore the argument made by the European Union that cash aid is more effective than food aid in assisting developing countries.

Domestic Farm Supports Another item mentioned in the Hong Kong agreement is domestic farm supports, which refers to any assistance given to farmers, even if it is not directly tied to exports. Such domestic assistance programs can still have an indirect effect on exports by lowering the costs (and hence augmenting the competitiveness) of domestic products. The Hong Kong agreement is only a first step toward classifying the extent of such programs in each country, without any firm commitment as to when they might be eliminated.

Cotton Subsidies Finally, export subsidies in cotton received special attention because that crop is exported by many low-income African countries and is highly subsidized in the United States. The United States agreed to eliminate these export subsidies, but that action has not yet occurred because the Hong Kong agreement was never ratified. Subsidies to the cotton industry remain a contentious issue between the United States and other exporting countries, such as Brazil.

# Other Matters from the Hong Kong WTO Meeting

Issues that are related to export subsidies were also discussed at the 2005 Hong Kong meeting, in addition to the elimination of the subsidies themselves. One of these issues is the use of tariffs as a response to other countries' use of subsidies. As we now explain, that issue is so contentious that it led to the breakup of the subsequent meeting in Geneva in 2008 and threatens to derail the Doha Round of negotiations.

Tariffs in Agriculture Export subsidies applied by large countries depress world prices, so that exporting countries can expect tariffs to be imposed on the subsidized products when they are imported by other countries. The agriculture-exporting developing countries pushed for a dramatic reduction in these and other agriculture-related tariffs, especially by importing industrial countries, but were not able to obtain such a commitment in Hong Kong.

These discussions continued three years later in Geneva. At that time, the developing country food importers wanted two special provisions allowing them to limit the amount by which tariffs would be lowered. First, they wanted a list of "special products" that would be completely exempt from tariff reductions. Second, they wanted a "special safeguard mechanism" that could be applied to all other agricultural products. Under this mechanism, tariffs could be temporarily raised whenever imports suddenly rose or their prices suddenly fell.

Recall from Chapter 8 that Article XIX of the GATT allows for such a "safeguard tariff," and that there are specific rules allowing for its use mainly in manufactured goods (see Side Bar: Key Provisions of the GATT in Chapter 8). The "special safeguard mechanism" in agriculture likewise requires that countries agree on the exact conditions under which it would be used. The problem in Hong Kong was that countries could not agree on the conditions under which a safeguard tariff could be temporarily applied. Likewise, the negotiators at the Geneva meeting could not agree on how many agricultural products could be treated as "special" by the importing countries, and exempt from any tariff cuts. These conflicts led to the breakdown of the Geneva talks in 2008, but must eventually be resolved before the Doha Round of negotiations can be concluded.

Issues Involving Trade in Industrial Goods and Services Other issues were also discussed in Hong Kong, as listed in Table 10-1. To achieve further cuts in the tariffs on industrial goods, there was agreement in principle to use some formula for the cuts, but the exact nature of that formula was left for future negotiation. There was also an agreement to discuss opening trade in service sectors, which would benefit the industrial countries and their large service industries. The developing countries are expected to make some future offers to open their markets to trade in services, but in return they will expect wealthy countries to accept more temporary immigrant workers in their service sectors. Finally, there was agreement to allow  $97\%$  of imported products from the world's 50 least developed countries (LDCs) to enter WTO member markets tariff free and duty free. The United States already allows duty-free and tariff-free access for  $83\%$  of products from those 50 countries, and under this agreement, the United States would extend that access to nearly all products. Omitted from this agreement, however, are textile imports into the United States from LDCs because the United States wants to protect its domestic textile producers from low-priced imports from countries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia. This is not surprising, given our discussion of the United States' sensitivity to low-cost imports in the clothing and textiles industries, as illustrated by the history of quotas on clothing imports (see Chapter 8).

# 2 Export Subsidies in a Small Home Country

To see the effect of export subsidies on prices, exports, and welfare, we begin with a small Home country that faces a fixed world price for its exports. Following that, we see how the outcomes differ when the Home country is large enough to affect world prices.

Consider a small country exporting sugar. The Home no-trade equilibrium is at point  $A$  in Figure 10-1. With free trade, Home faces the world price of sugar  $P^W$ . In panel (a) of Figure 10-1, the quantity supplied in Home at that price is  $S_1$  and the quantity demanded is  $D_1$  tons of sugar. Because quantity demanded is less than quantity supplied, the Home country exports  $X_1 = S_1 - D_1$  tons under free trade. That quantity of exports is shown as point  $B$  in panel (b) corresponding to the free-trade price of  $P^W$ . By determining the level of exports at other prices, we can trace out the Home export supply curve  $X$ .

# Impact of an Export Subsidy

Now suppose that because the government wishes to boost the exports of the domestic sugar producers, each ton of sugar exported receives a subsidy of  $s$  dollars from the government. Panel (a) of Figure 10-1 traces the effect of this subsidy on the domestic economy. With an export subsidy of  $s$  dollars per ton, exporters will receive  $P^{W} + s$  for

FIGURE 10-1

Export Subsidy for a Small Country Applying a subsidy of  $s$  dollars per unit exported will increase the price that Home exporters receive from  $P^W$  to  $P^W + s$ . As a result, the domestic price of the similar good will also rise by that amount. This price rise leads to an increase in Home quantity supplied from  $S_1$  to  $S_2$  and a decrease in Home quantity demanded from  $D_1$  to  $D_2$ , in panel (a). Exports rise as a result of the subsidy, from  $X_{1}$  to  $X_{2}$  in panel (b). The Home export supply curve shifts down by exactly the amount of the subsidy since the marginal cost of a unit of exports decreases by exactly  $s$ . As in the case of a tariff, the deadweight loss as a result of the subsidy is the triangle  $(b + d)$ , the sum of consumer loss  $b$  and producer loss  $d$ .

each ton exported rather than the lower free-trade price  $P^W$ . Because they are allowed to export any amount they want at the subsidized price, the Home firms will not accept a price less than  $P^W + s$  for their domestic sales: if the domestic price was less than  $P^W + s$ , the firms would just export all their sugar at the higher price. Thus, the domestic price for sugar must rise to  $P^W + s$  so that it equals the export price received by Home firms.

Notice that with the domestic sugar price rising to  $P^W + s$ , Home consumers could in principle import sugar at the price of  $P^W$  rather than buy it from local firms. To prevent imports from coming into the country, we assume that the Home government has imposed an import tariff equal to (or higher than) the amount of the export subsidy. This is a realistic assumption. Many subsidized agricultural products that are exported are also protected by an import tariff to prevent consumers from buying at lower world prices. We see that the combined effect of the export subsidy and import tariff is to raise the price paid by Home consumers and received by Home firms.

With the price rising to  $P^{W} + s$ , the quantity supplied in Home increases to  $S_{2}$  while the quantity demanded falls to  $D_{2}$  in panel (a). Therefore, Home exports increase to  $X_{2} = S_{2} - D_{2}$ . The change in the quantity of exports can be thought of in two ways as reflected by points  $C$  and  $C'$  in panel (b). On one hand, if we were to measure the Home price  $P^{W}$  on the vertical axis, point  $C$  is on the original Home export supply curve  $X$ : that is, the rise in Home price has resulted in a movement along Home's initial supply curve from point  $B$  to  $C$  since the quantity of exports has increased with the Home price.

On the other hand, with the vertical axis of panel (b) measuring the world price and given our small-country assumption that the world price is fixed at  $P^W$ , the increase in exports from  $X_1$  to  $X_2$  because of the subsidy can be interpreted as a shift of the domestic export supply curve to  $X - s$ , which includes point  $C'$ . Recall from Chapter 8 that the export supply curve shifts by precisely the amount of the tariff. Here, because the export subsidy is like a negative tariff, the Home export supply curve shifts down by exactly the amount  $s$ . In other words, the subsidy allows firms to sell their goods to the world market at a price exactly  $s$  dollars lower at any point on the export supply curve; thus, the export supply curve shifts down. According to our small-country assumption, Home is a price taker in the world market and thus always sells abroad at the world price  $P^W$ ; the only difference is that with the subsidy, Home exports higher quantities.

Summary From the domestic perspective, the export subsidy increases both the price and quantity of exports, a movement along the domestic export supply curve. From the world perspective, the export subsidy results in an increase in export supply and, given an unchanged world price (because of the small-country assumption), the export supply curve shifts down by the amount of the subsidy  $s$ . As was the case with a tariff, the subsidy has driven a wedge between what domestic exporters receive ( $P^{W} + s$  at point  $C$ ) and what importers abroad pay ( $P^{W}$  at point  $C'$ ).

Impact of the Subsidy on Home Welfare Our next step is to determine the impact of the subsidy on the welfare of the exporting country. The rise in Home price lowers consumer surplus by the amount  $(a + b)$  in panel (a). That is the area between the two prices  $(P^{W}$  and  $P^{W} + s)$  and underneath the demand curve  $D$ . On the other hand, the price increase raises producer surplus by the amount  $(a + b + c)$ , the area between the two prices  $(P^{W}$  and  $P^{W} + s)$ , and above the supply curve  $S$ . Finally, we need to determine the effect on government revenue. The export subsidy costs the government  $s$  per unit exported, or  $s \cdot X_2$  in total. That revenue cost is shown by the area  $(b + c + d)$ .

Adding up the impact on consumers, producers, and government revenue, the overall impact of the export subsidy is

Fall in consumer surplus:  $-(a + b)$

Rise in producer surplus:  $+(a + b + c)$

Fall in government revenue:  $-(b + c + d)$

Net effect on Home welfare:  $-(b + d)$

The triangle  $(b + d)$  in panel (b) is the net loss or deadweight loss due to the subsidy in a small country. The result that an export subsidy leads to a deadweight loss for the exporter is similar to the result that a tariff leads to a deadweight loss for an importing country. As with a tariff, the areas  $b$  and  $d$  can be given precise interpretations. The triangle  $d$  equals the increase in marginal costs for the extra units produced because of the subsidy and can be interpreted as the production loss or the efficiency loss for the economy. The area of the triangle  $b$  can be interpreted as the drop in consumer surplus for those individuals no longer consuming the units between  $D_{1}$  and  $D_{2}$ , which we call the consumption loss for the economy. The combination of the production and consumption losses is the deadweight loss for the exporting country.

# 3 Export Subsidies in a Large Home Country

Now suppose that the Home country is a large enough seller on international markets so that its subsidy affects the world price of the sugar (e.g., this occurs with European sugar subsidies and U.S. cotton subsidies). This large-country case is illustrated in Figure 10-2. In panel (b), we draw the Foreign import demand curve  $M^{*}$  as downward-sloping because changes in the amount exported, as will occur when Home applies a subsidy, now affect the world price.

Under free trade, the Home and world price is  $P^W$ . At this price, Home exports  $X_1 = S_1 - D_1$ , and the world export market is in equilibrium at the intersection of Home export supply  $X$  and Foreign import demand  $M^*$ . Home and Foreign consumers pay the same price for the good,  $P^W$ , which is the world price.

# Effect of the Subsidy

Suppose that Home applies a subsidy of  $s$  dollars per ton of sugar exported. As we found for the small country, a subsidy to Home export production is shown as a downward shift of the Home export supply curve in panel (b) by the amount  $s$ ; the vertical distance between the original export supply curve  $X$  and the new export supply curve  $X - s$  is precisely the amount of the subsidy  $s$ . The new intersection of Home export supply,  $X - s$ , and Foreign import demand  $M^{*}$  corresponds to a new world price of  $P^{*}$ , decreased from the free-trade world price  $P^{W}$ , and a Home price  $P^{*} + s$ , increased from the free-trade price  $P^{W}$ . Furthermore, the equilibrium with the subsidy now occurs at the export quantity  $X_{2}$  in panel (b), increased from  $X_{1}$ .

In Chapter 2, we defined the terms of trade for a country as the ratio of export prices to import prices. Generally, a fall in the terms of trade indicates a loss for a country because it is either receiving less for exports or paying more for imports. We have

# FIGURE 10-2

Export Subsidy for a Large Country Panel (a) shows the effects of the subsidy at Home. The Home price increases from  $P^W$  to  $P^* + s$ , Home quantity demanded decreases from  $D_1$  to  $D_2$ , and Home quantity supplied increases from  $S_1$  to  $S_2$ . The deadweight loss for Home is the area of triangle  $(b + d)$ , but Home also has a terms-of-trade loss of area  $e$ . In the world market, the Home subsidy shifts out the export supply curve from  $X$  to  $X - s$  in panel (b). As in the small-country case, the

(b) World Market export supply curve shifts down by the amount of the subsidy, reflecting the lower marginal cost of exports. As a result, the world price falls from  $P^W$  to  $P^*$ . The Foreign country gains the consumer surplus area  $e'$ , so the world deadweight loss due to the subsidy is the area  $(b + d + f)$ . The extra deadweight loss  $f$  arises because only a portion of the Home terms-of-trade loss is a Foreign gain.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/48c0a792826ef40846b6195c90cbdc0bfc4b1658d45e678ed7358afd67130a65.jpg)

found that with the export subsidy, Foreign consumers pay a lower price for Home exports, which is therefore a fall in the Home terms of trade but a gain in the Foreign terms of trade. We should expect, therefore, that the Home country will suffer an overall loss because of the subsidy but that Foreign consumers will gain. To confirm these effects, let's investigate the impact of the subsidy on Home and Foreign welfare.

Home Welfare In panel (a) of Figure 10-2, the increase in the Home price from  $P^W$  to  $P^{*} + s$  reduces consumer surplus by the amount  $(a + b)$ . In addition, the increase in the price benefits Home firms, and producer surplus rises by the amount  $(a + b + c)$ . We also need to take into account the cost of the subsidy. Because the amount of the subsidy is  $s$ , and the amount of Home exports (after the subsidy) is  $X_{2} = S_{2} - D_{2}$ , it follows that the revenue cost of the subsidy to the government is the area  $(b + c + d + e)$ , which equals  $s \cdot X_{2}$  (the government pays  $s$  for every unit exported). Therefore, the overall impact of the subsidy in the large country can be summarized as follows:

Fall in consumer surplus:  $-(a + b)$

Rise in producer surplus:  $+(a + b + c)$

Fall in government revenue:  $-(b + c + d + e)$

Net effect on Home welfare:  $-(b + d + e)$

In the world market, panel (b), the triangle  $(b + d)$  is the deadweight loss due to the subsidy, just as it is for a small country. For the large country, however, there is an extra source of loss, the area  $e$ , which is the terms-of-trade loss to Home:  $e = e' + f$  in panel (b). When we analyze Foreign and world welfare, it will be useful to divide the Home terms-of-trade loss into two sections,  $e'$  and  $f$ , but from Home's perspective, the terms-of-trade welfare loss is just their sum, area  $e$ . This loss is the decrease in export revenue because the world price has fallen to  $P^{*}$ ; Home loses the difference between  $P^{W}$  and  $P^{*}$  on each of  $X_{2}$  units exported. So a large country loses even more from a subsidy than a small country because of the reduction in the world price of its exported good.

Foreign and World Welfare While Home definitely loses from the subsidy, the Foreign importing country definitely gains. Panel (b) of Figure 10-2 illustrates the consumer surplus benefit to Foreign of the Home subsidy; the price of Foreign imports decreases and Foreign's terms of trade improves. The change in consumer surplus for Foreign is area  $e'$ , the area below its import demand curve  $M^*$  and between the free-trade world price  $P^W$  and the new world price (with subsidy)  $P^*$ .

When we combine the total Home consumption and production losses  $(b + d)$  plus the Home terms-of-trade loss  $e$ , and subtract the Foreign terms-of-trade gain  $e'$ , there is an overall deadweight loss for the world, which is measured by the area  $(b + d + f)$  in panel (b). The area  $f$  is the additional world deadweight loss due to the subsidy, which arises because the terms-of-trade loss in Home is not completely offset by a terms-of-trade gain in Foreign.

Because there is a transfer of terms of trade from Home to Foreign, the export subsidy might seem like a good policy tool for large wealthy countries seeking to give aid to poorer countries. However, this turns out not to be the case. The deadweight loss  $f$  means that using the export subsidy to increase Home production and send the excess exported goods overseas (as was the case for food aid, discussed earlier as an example of an indirect subsidy) is an inefficient way to transfer gains from trade among countries. It would be more efficient to simply give cash aid in the amount of the Home terms-of-trade loss to poor importers, a policy approach that, because it does not change the free-trade levels of production and consumption in either country, would avoid the deadweight loss  $(b + d + f)$  associated with the subsidy. This argument is made by the European countries, which, several years ago, eliminated transfers of food as a form of aid and switched to cash payments. The United States has now agreed to make the same policy change, as discussed in the following application.

# APPLICATION

# Who Gains and Who Loses?

Now that we have studied the effect of export subsidies on world prices and trade volume in theory, we return to the agreements of the Hong Kong meeting of the WTO in December 2005 and ask: Which countries will gain and which will lose when export subsidies (including the "indirect" subsidies like food aid) are ever eliminated?

Gains The obvious gainers from this action will be current agricultural exporters in developing countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia, and Thailand, along with potential exporters such as India and China. These countries will gain from the rise in world prices as agricultural subsidies by the industrialized countries—especially

Europe and the United States--are eliminated. These countries will gain even more when and if an agreement is reached on the elimination of agricultural tariffs in the industrial countries, including Japan and South Korea, that protect crops such as rice. Both of these actions will also benefit the industrial countries themselves, which suffer both a deadweight loss and a terms-of-trade loss from the combination of export subsidies and import tariffs in agriculture. Farmers in the industrial countries who lose the subsidies will be worse off, and the government might choose to offset that loss with some type of adjustment assistance. In the United States and Europe, however, it is often the largest farmers who benefit the most from subsidy programs, and they may be better able to adjust to the elimination of subsidies (through switching to other crops) than small farmers.

Losses Which countries will lose from the elimination of export subsidies? To the extent that the elimination of export subsidies leads to higher world prices, as we expect from our analysis (in Figure 10-2, the price would rise from  $P^{*}$  to  $P^{W}$ ), then the food-importing countries, typically the poorer non-food-producing countries, will lose. This theoretical result is confirmed by several empirical studies. One study found that the existing pattern of agricultural supports (tariffs and subsidies) raises the per capita income of two-thirds of 77 developing nations, including most of the poorest countries, such as Burundi and Zambia. This result is illustrated in Figure 10-3. Panel (a) shows net agricultural exports graphed against countries' income per capita over the period 1990 to 2000. The poorer countries (i.e., those lower on the income scale on the horizontal axis) export more agricultural products and therefore would benefit from a rise in their prices. But for food exports in panel (b), rather than total agricultural exports (which includes non-food items like cotton), it is the middle-income countries that export the most. Panel (c) shows that poor countries are net importers of essential food items such as corn, rice, and wheat (summarized as "cereal exports") and would be harmed by an increase in their world price. Many of the world's poorest individuals depend on cereal crops for much of their diet and would be especially hard hit by any increase in those prices.

Food Aid What about indirect subsidies such as food aid? The United States has been a principal supplier of food aid, which it uses for both humanitarian purposes and to get rid of surpluses of food products at home. No country will argue with the need for donations in cases of starvation, as have occurred recently in the Darfur region of Sudan and in 1984 in Ethiopia, but the United States also provides food shipments to regions without shortages, an action that can depress local prices and harm local producers. European countries stopped this practice many years ago and argue that it is better to instead have United Nations relief agencies buy food from local farmers in poor regions and then distribute it to the poorest individuals in a country. In this way, the European countries boost production in the country and help to feed its poorest citizens. In the Hong Kong talks, the European Union insisted that the indirect subsidies to regions without shortages be eliminated.

Panel (c) shows that poor countries are net importers of essential food items (cereals) such as corn, rice, and wheat and would be harmed by an increase in their world price.

Even though the proposals from the Hong Kong talks were never ratified and the elimination of tariff and subsidies in agriculture has not occurred, the Doha Round of negotiations is still ongoing and some progress has been made toward the goal of replacing food aid with efforts to increase production. In 2009, the Group of Eight

$(\mathrm{G8})^4$  countries pledged to increase funding for agricultural development by 12 billion per year, as described in Headlines: G8 Shifts Focus from Food Aid to Farming. This pledge represents a shift in focus away from food aid and toward agricultural sustainability in developing countries. As the Headlines article describes, this approach is a major shift in focus for the United States, where 20 times more money has been spent on food aid than on projects to increase local production.

Despite this announcement, however, many observers remain skeptical that the funding for agricultural development in poor countries will be forthcoming. After the G8 summit many editorials appeared challenging these countries to follow through on their pledges. We include one of these editorials in *Headlines: Hunger and Food Security Back on Political Agenda*; this one written by the chairman of the European Food Security Group, a network of 40 European nongovernmental organizations.

# HEADLINES

# G8 Shifts Focus from Food Aid to Farming

This article announces a new "food security initiative" from the G8 countries, who promised billions of dollars to assist farmers in developing countries. As the next Headlines article describes, however, not all observers believe that these funds will be forthcoming, despite the overwhelming need for the assistance.

The G8 countries will this week announce a "food security initiative," committing more than 12 [billion] for agricultural development over the next three years, in a move that signals a further shift from food aid to long-term investments in farming in the developing world.

The US and Japan will provide the bulk of the funding, with  $3-$ 4 [billion] each, with the rest coming from Europe and Canada, according to United Nations officials and Group of Eight diplomats briefed on the "L'Aquila Food Security Initiative." Officials said it would more than triple spending… .

The G8 initiative underscores Washington's new approach to fighting global hunger, reversing a two-decade-old policy focused almost exclusively on food aid. Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, and Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, have both highlighted the shifting emphasis in recent speeches.

"For too long, our primary response [to fight hunger] has been to send emergency [food] aid when the crisis is at its worst," Ms. Clinton said last month. "This saves lives, but it doesn't address hunger's root causes. It is, at best, a short-term fix."

Washington's shift could prove contentious in the US, as its farmers are the largest exporters of several crops, including soyabean and corn. The US is the world's largest donor of food aid—mainly crops grown by US farmers, costing more than 2 [billion] last year.

The Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a think-tank, estimates that Washington spends 20 times more on food aid than on long-term schemes in Africa to boost local food production. US annual spending on African farming projects topped  \$400 [million] in the 1980s, but by 2006 had dwindled to\$ 60 [million], the council said in a report this year… .

# Hunger and Food Security Back on Political Agenda

This article expresses skepticism that the promises of the G8 countries for billions of dollars to assist farmers in developing countries will be forthcoming.

Global food security is a political and economic priority for the first time since the early 1970s. That should be the key message from the decision by the G8 group of leading economic nations to endorse a "food security initiative" at their meeting in Italy this week. But this welcome decision needs to be followed up by further significant policy change at national and international level if food security is to be achieved for the world's growing population over the coming decades…

It is reported that the initiative will involve a commitment of  \$12 billion for agricultural development over the next three years. But before giving three cheers for the G8, two critical questions must be answered. Is the\$ 12 billion additional resources or a repackaging of existing commitments? How can this initiative feed into sustained policy change aimed at increasing food security at household, national and global level?

Policy change is necessary in many countries which are currently food insecure. Investment in agricultural and rural development has been shamefully neglected over the past 30 years. Donors, including the World Bank, also bear responsibility for this. There must now be an acceptance that budget allocations to agriculture must increase and must be sustained… . The history of such summits is not good: the gap between the promises and subsequent actions is great. At the first such summit in 1974, Dr. Henry Kissinger made the pledge that "within 10 years, no child will go to bed hungry."

The G8 food security initiative at least provides a positive backdrop to the summit. It should provide an opportunity to many developing

With one billion hungry people in the world, with growing populations and with the threat that climate change presents to agricultural production capacity, such a commitment is both critical and urgent. It is good politics and good economics to do so.

# 4 Production Subsidies

The agreements reached in Hong Kong in 2005 distinguish between export subsidies in agriculture—which will be eliminated—and all other forms of domestic support that increase production (e.g., tax incentives and other types of subsidies). The agreements make this distinction because other forms of agricultural support are expected to have less impact on exports than direct subsidies. Therefore, there is less impact on other countries from having domestic support programs as compared with export subsidies. To illustrate this idea, let's examine the impact of a "production subsidy" in agriculture for both a small and a large country.

Suppose the government provides a subsidy of  $s$  dollars for every unit (e.g., ton of sugar in our example) that a Home firm produces. This is a production subsidy because it is a subsidy to every unit produced and not just to units that are exported. There are several ways that a government can implement such a subsidy. The government might guarantee a minimum price to the farmer, for example, and make up the difference between the minimum price and any lower price for which the farmer sells.

Alternatively, the government might provide subsidies to users of the crop to purchase it, thus increasing demand and raising market prices; this would act like a subsidy to every unit produced. As mentioned earlier, the United States has used both methods to support its cotton growers.

These policies all fall under Article XVI of the GATT (see Side Bar: Key Provisions of the GATT in Chapter 8). Article XVI states that partner countries should be notified of the extent of such subsidies, and when possible, they should be limited. In Hong Kong, the WTO members further agreed to classify countries according to the extent of such subsidies, with the European Union classified as having a high level of production subsidies, the United States and Japan having a middle level, and all other countries having low subsidies (see Table 10-1). Future discussion will determine the timing and extent of cuts in these production subsidies.

# Effect of a Production Subsidy in a Small Home Country

To illustrate the effect of a production subsidy, we begin with a small country that faces a fixed world price of  $P^W$ . In Figure 10-4, panel (a), the production subsidy of  $s$  increases the price received by Home producers to  $P^W + s$  and increases Home's quantity supplied from  $S_1$  to  $S_2$ . The quantity demanded at Home does not change,

Production Subsidy for a Small Country In panel (a), applying a production subsidy of  $s$  dollars per unit produced will increase the price that Home firms receive from  $P^W$  to  $P^W + s$ . This price rise leads to an increase in Home quantity supplied from  $S_1$  to  $S_2$ . The consumer price at Home is not affected because the production subsidy does not distinguish between items sold at Home or exported (firms therefore continue to charge the world price at Home), so the quantity demanded stays at  $D_{1}$ . The deadweight loss of the subsidy for a small country is the area  $c$ . In panel (b), exports rise as a result of the production subsidy, from  $X_{1}$  to  $X_{2}$ , though the increase in exports is less than for the export subsidy because, for the production subsidy, quantity demanded does not change at Home.

however, because producers continue to charge the world price at Home. This is the case (in contrast to the export subsidy) because Home producers receive a subsidy regardless of whom they sell to (domestic consumers or Foreign consumers through exporting). So with a production subsidy, Home producers charge the world price to Foreign consumers and receive the extra subsidy from the government and likewise charge the world price to Home consumers, and again receive the extra subsidy. In contrast, for an export subsidy, Home firms receive the subsidy only for export sales and not for domestic sales.

Because the price for Home consumers with the production subsidy is still  $P^W$ , there is no change in the quantity demanded at Home, which remains at  $D_1$ . In panel (b), we see that the production subsidy increases the quantity of exports from  $X_1 = S_1 - D_1$  to  $X_2 = S_2 - D_1$ . Because demand is not affected, the production subsidy increases exports by less than an export subsidy would. That result occurs because the quantity demanded decreases with an export subsidy due to higher Home prices, leading to greater Home exports. In contrast, with the production subsidy, the quantity demanded at Home is unchanged, so exports do not rise as much.

Home Welfare With the increase in the price received by Home producers, from  $P_W$  to  $P_W + s$ , there is a corresponding rise in producer surplus of the amount  $(a + b)$  in panel (a). The government revenue cost of the subsidy is the entire area  $(a + b + c)$ , which equals the amount of the subsidy  $s$ , times Home production  $S_2$ . So the overall impact of the production subsidy is

<table><tr><td>Change in consumer surplus:</td><td>none (because demand is not affected)</td></tr><tr><td>Rise in producer surplus:</td><td>+(a+b)</td></tr><tr><td>Fall in government revenue:</td><td>-(a+b+c)</td></tr><tr><td>Net effect on Home welfare:</td><td>-c</td></tr></table>

The deadweight loss caused by the production subsidy in a small country, area  $c$ , is less than that caused by the export subsidy in Figure 10-1, which is area  $(b + d)$ . The reason that the production subsidy has a lower deadweight loss than the export subsidy is that consumer decisions have not been affected at all: Home consumers still face the price of  $P^W$ . The production subsidy increases the quantity supplied by Home producers, just as an export subsidy does, but the production subsidy does so without raising the price for Home consumers. The only deadweight loss is in production inefficiency: the higher subsidized price encourages Home producers to increase the amount of production at higher marginal costs (i.e., farther right along the supply curve) than would occur in a market equilibrium without the subsidy.

Targeting Principle Our finding that the deadweight loss is lower for the production subsidy makes it a better policy instrument than the export subsidy to achieve an increase in Home supply. This finding is an example of the targeting principle: to achieve some objective, it is best to use the policy instrument that achieves the objective most directly. If the objective of the Home government is to increase cotton supply, for example, and therefore benefit cotton growers, it is better to use a production subsidy than an export subsidy. Of course, the benefits to cotton growers come at the expense of government revenue.

There are many examples of this targeting principle in economics. To limit the consumption of cigarettes and improve public health, the best policy is a tax on cigarette purchases, as many countries use. To reduce pollution from automobiles, the best policy would be a tax on gasoline, the magnitude of which is much higher in Europe than in the United States. And, to use an example from this book, to compensate people for losses from international trade, it is better to provide trade adjustment assistance directly (discussed in Chapter 3) to those affected than to impose an import tariff or quota.

# Effect of the Production Subsidy in a Large Home Country

We will not draw the large-country case in detail but will use Figure 10-4 to briefly explain the effects of a production subsidy on prices, exports, and welfare. When the price for Home producers rises from  $P^{W}$  to  $P^{W} + s$ , the quantity of the exported good supplied increases from  $S_{1}$  to  $S_{2}$ . Because demand has not changed, exports increase by exactly the same amount as the quantity supplied by domestic producers. We show that increase in exports by the outward shift of the export supply curve, from  $X$  to  $X'$  in panel (b). As mentioned previously, the rise in the quantity of exports due to the production subsidy, from point  $B$  to  $C'$  in Figure 10-4, is less than the increase in the quantity of exports for the export subsidy, from point  $B$  to  $C'$  shown in Figure 10-1. With the export subsidy, the price for Home producers and consumers rose to  $P^{W} + s$ , so exports increased because of both the rise in quantity supplied and the drop in quantity demanded. As a result, the export subsidy shifted down the Home export supply curve by exactly the amount  $s$  in Figure 10-1. In contrast, with a production subsidy, exports rise only because Home quantity supplied increases so that export supply shifts down by an amount less than  $s$  in Figure 10-4.

If we drew a downward-sloping Foreign import demand curve in panel (b), then the increase in supply as a result of the production subsidy would lower the world price. But that drop in world price would be less than the drop that occurred with the export subsidy because the increase in exports under the production subsidy is less.

Summary Production subsidies in agriculture still lower world prices, but they lower prices by less than export subsidies. For this reason, the WTO is less concerned with eliminating production subsidies and other forms of domestic support for agriculture. These policies have a smaller impact on world prices and, as we have also shown, a smaller deadweight loss as compared with that of export subsidies.

# 5 Export Tariffs

Export and production subsidies are not the only policies that countries use to influence trade in certain products. Some countries apply export tariffs—which are taxes applied by the exporting country when a good leaves the country. As we saw in the introduction to this chapter, Argentina applies export tariffs on many of its agricultural products. Mozambique charges a tariff on exports of diamonds, and Thailand charges a tariff on exports of teak wood. The main purpose of these export tariffs is to raise revenue for the government; farmers and other companies do not benefit from the export tariffs, because they pay the tax.

In this section we look at how export tariffs affect the overall welfare of the exporting country, taking into account the effects on consumers, producers, and government revenue. We start with the case of a small exporting country, facing fixed world prices. Following that, we look at how the outcome differs when the country is large enough to affect world prices.

# Impact of an Export Tariff in a Small Country

Consider a small country (like Argentina) that exports soybeans. The Home no-trade equilibrium is shown at point  $A$  in panel (a) of Figure 10-5. With free trade, Home faces a world price of soybeans of  $P^W$  pesos (we are using the currency of Argentina). At that price, the quantity supplied at Home is  $S_1$  and the quantity demanded is  $D_1$  in panel (a), so Home will export soybeans. The quantity of exports is  $X_1 = S_1 - D_1$ , which is shown by point  $B$  in panel (b). So far, the free trade equilibrium in Figure 10-5 is the same as that in Figure 10-1, which showed the impact of an export subsidy. But the two figures will change when we consider the effects of an export tariff.

Now suppose that the government applies a tariff of  $t$  pesos to the exports of soybeans. Instead of receiving the world price of  $P^W$ , producers will instead receive the price of  $P^W - t$  for their exports, because the government collects  $t$  pesos. If the price they receive at Home is any higher than this amount, then producers will sell only in the Home market and not export at all. As a result there would be an oversupply at Home and the local price would fall. Thus, in equilibrium, the Home price must also fall to equal the export price of  $P^W - t$ .

FIGURE 10-5

Export Tariff for a Small Country Panel (a): Applying an export tariff of  $t$  pesos per unit exported decreases the price that Home exporters receive from  $P^W$  to  $P^W - t$ . As a result, the domestic price of the similar good also falls by that amount. This price fall leads to a decrease in Home quantity supplied from  $S_1$  to  $S_2$ , and an increase in Home quantity demanded from  $D_1$ to  $D_{2}$ , in panel (a). Exports fall due to the tariff, from  $X_{1}$  to  $X_{2}$ . Panel (b): The Home export supply curve shifts up by the amount of the tariff because the marginal cost of a unit of exports increases by exactly  $t$ . The deadweight loss due to the subsidy is the triangle  $(b + d)$ , the sum of the consumption loss  $b$  and production loss  $d$ .

With the price falling to  $P^{W} - t$ , the quantity supplied in Home falls to  $S_{2}$ , and the quantity demanded increases to  $D_{2}$  in panel (a). Therefore, Home exports fall to  $X_{2} = S_{2} - D_{2}$ . The change in the quantity of exports can be thought of as a leftward, or upward, shift of the export supply curve in panel (b), where we measure the world price rather than the Home price on the vertical axis. The export supply curve shifts up by the amount of the tariff  $t$ . This result is analogous to what happened when we introduced a subsidy in Figure 10-1. In that case, the export supply curve fell by the amount of the subsidy  $s$ .

The new intersection of supply and demand in the world market is at point  $C$  in panel (b), with exports of  $X_{2}$ . Alternatively, on the original export supply curve  $X$ , exports of  $X_{2}$  occur at the point  $C'$  and the domestic price of  $P^{W} - t$ .

Impact of the Export Tariff on Small Country Welfare We can now determine the impact of the tariff on the welfare of the small exporting country. Since the Home price falls because of the export tariff, consumers benefit. The rise in consumer surplus is shown by area  $a$  in panel (a). Producers are worse off, however, and the fall in producer surplus is shown by the amount  $(a + b + c + d)$ . The government collects revenue from the export tariff, and the amount of revenue equals the amount of the tariff  $t$  times exports of  $X_{2}$ , area  $c$ .

Adding up the impact on consumers, producers, and government revenue, the overall impact of the export tariff on the welfare of a small exporting country is:

<table><tr><td>Rise in consumer surplus:</td><td>+ a</td></tr><tr><td>Fall in producer surplus:</td><td>-(a+b+c+d)</td></tr><tr><td>Rise in government revenue:</td><td>+c</td></tr><tr><td>Net effect on Home welfare:</td><td>-(b+d)</td></tr></table>

To sum up, the export tariff for a small country has a deadweight loss of  $(b + d)$ . (This outcome is similar to the results of the import tariff that we studied in Chapter 8 and the export subsidy we studied earlier in this chapter.) That loss can be broken up into two components. The triangle  $b$  in panel (a) is the consumption loss for the economy. It occurs because as consumers increase their quantity from  $D_{1}$  to  $D_{2}$ , the amount that they value these extra units varies between  $P^{W}$  and  $P^{W} - t$ , along their demand curve. The true cost to the economy of these extra units consumed is always  $P^{W}$ . Therefore, the value of the extra units is less than their cost to the economy, indicating that there is a deadweight loss.

Triangle  $d$  is the production loss for the economy. It occurs because as producers reduce their quantity from  $S_{1}$  to  $S_{2}$ , the marginal cost of supplying those units varies between  $P^{W}$  and  $P^{W} - t$ , along their supply curve. But the true value to the economy of these extra units consumed is always  $P^{W}$ , because that is the price at which they could be exported without the tariff. Therefore, the value of the forgone units exceeds their cost to the economy, indicating again that there is a deadweight loss.

# Impact of an Export Tariff in a Large Country

We have shown that the export tariff in a small country leads to a decline in overall welfare. Despite that, some governments—especially in developing countries—find that export tariffs are a convenient way to raise revenue, because it is very easy to apply the tax at border stations as goods leave the country. The fact that the economy overall suffers a loss does not prevent governments from using this policy.

What happens in a large exporting country? Does an export tariff still produce an overall loss? Recall from Chapter 8 that an import tariff in a large country would lead to an overall gain rather than a loss, provided that the tariff is not too high. This gain arises because the import tariff reduces demand for the imported product, and therefore lowers its price, which leads to a terms-of-trade gain. In this section, we see that an export tariff also leads to a terms-of-trade gain. That result occurs because an export tariff reduces the amount supplied to the world market, and therefore increases the price of the export product, which is a terms-of-trade gain.

Figure 10-6 illustrates the effect of an export tariff for a large country. Under free trade the price of soybeans is  $P^{W}$ , which is at the intersection of Home export supply  $X$  and Foreign import demand  $M^{*}$  in panel (b). When the government applies a tariff of  $t$  pesos to soybean exports, the Home export supply curve shifts up by exactly the amount of the tariff from  $X$  to  $X + t$ . The new intersection of the Home export supply curve and the Foreign import demand curve occurs at point  $C$ , and the world price has risen from  $P^{W}$  to  $P^{*}$ .

The price  $P^{*}$  is paid by Foreign buyers of soybeans and includes the export tariff. The Foreign import demand curve  $M^{*}$  is downward sloping rather than horizontal as it was in Figure 10-5 for a small country. Because the Foreign import demand curve slopes downward, the price  $P^{*}$  is greater than  $P^{W}$  but not by as much as the tariff  $t$ , which equals the upward shift in the export supply curve. Home receives price  $P^{*} - t$ ,

FIGURE 10-6

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/041a1c8ed1de4a140469a33cf5c6b37c0b7d8304428d343ebbb4b5d1eed0605f.jpg)

Export Tariff for a Large Country The tariff shifts up the export supply curve from  $X$  to  $X + t$ , in panel (b). As a result, the world price increases from  $P^W$  to  $P^*$ . But this increase in the world price is less than the upward shift in export supply of  $t$ . It follows that the Home price decreases from  $P^W$  to

$P^{*} - t$ , in panel (a). Home quantity demanded increases from  $D_{1}$  to  $D_{2}$ , and Home quantity supplied decreases from  $S_{1}$  to  $S_{2}$ . The deadweight loss for Home is the area of triangle  $(b + d)$ . Because world price rises from  $P^{W}$  to  $P^{*}$ , Home also has a terms-of-trade gain of area  $e$ .

which is measured net of the export tariff. Because  $P^{*}$  has risen above  $P^{W}$  by less than the amount  $t$ , it follows that  $P^{*} - t$  falls below  $P^{W}$ , as shown in panel (a).

Impact of the Export Tariff on Large Country Welfare We can now determine the impact of the tariff on the welfare of the large exporting country. Home consumer and producers faced the free trade price of  $P^W$  under free trade, but face the lower price of  $P^{*} - t$  once the tariff is applied. The rise in consumer surplus is shown by area  $a$  in panel (a) and the fall in producer surplus is shown by area  $(a + b + c + d)$ . The revenue the government collects from the export tariff equals the amount of the tariff  $t$  times exports of  $X_{2}$ , by area  $(c + e)$ .

Adding up the impacts on consumers, producers, and government revenue, the overall impact of the export tariff on the welfare of a large exporting country is:

<table><tr><td>Rise in consumer surplus:</td><td>+ a</td></tr><tr><td>Fall in producer surplus:</td><td>-(a+b+c+d)</td></tr><tr><td>Rise in government revenue:</td><td>+(c+e)</td></tr><tr><td>Net effect on Home welfare:</td><td>e-(b+d)</td></tr></table>

Compared with the effect of an export tariff for a small country, we find that the net effect on large-country Home welfare can be positive rather than negative, as long as  $e < (b + d)$ . The amount  $(b + d)$  is still the deadweight loss; area  $e$  is the terms-of-trade gain due to the export tariff. In either panel of Figure 10-6, this terms-of-trade gain is measured by the rise in the price paid by Foreign purchasers of soybeans, from  $P^{W}$  to  $P^{*}$ , multiplied by the amount of exports  $X_{2}$ . This terms-of-trade gain is the "extra" money that Home receives from exporting soybeans at a higher price. If the terms-of-trade gain exceeds the deadweight loss, then the Home country gains overall from applying the tariff.

To sum up, the effect of an export tariff is most similar to that of an import tariff because it leads to a terms-of-trade gain. In Chapter 8 we argued that for an import tariff that is not too high, the terms-of-trade gain  $e$  would always exceed the dead-weight loss  $(b + d)$ . That argument applies here, too, so that for export tariffs that are not too high, the terms-of-trade gain  $e$  exceeds the deadweight loss and Home country gains. In Chapter 8 we stressed that this terms-of-trade gain came at the expense of the Foreign country, which earns a lower price for the product it sells under an import tariff. Similarly, the Foreign country loses under an export tariff because it is paying a higher price for the product it is buying. So, just as we called an import tariff a beggar-thy-neighbor policy, the same idea applies to export tariffs because they harm the Foreign country. These results are the opposite of those we found for an export subsidy, which for a large Home country always leads to a terms-of-trade loss for Home and a benefit for Foreign buyers.

# 6 Export Quotas

The finding that a large country can gain from an export tariff gives a government an added reason to use this policy, in addition to earning the tariff revenue. There is one other export policy that also benefits the large country applying it: an export quota, which is a limit on the amount that firms are allowed to export. The most well-known system of export quotas in the world today is the system used by the Organization of

Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which includes six countries in the Middle East, four in Africa, and two in South America. OPEC sets limits on the amount of oil that can be exported by each country, and by limiting oil exports in this way, it keeps world petroleum prices high. Those high prices benefit not only OPEC's member countries, but also other oil-exporting countries that do not belong to OPEC. (At the same time, the high prices clearly harm oil-importing countries). The oil companies themselves benefit from the export quotas because they earn the higher prices. Thus, the export quota is different from an export tariff (which is, in effect, a tax on firms that lowers their producer surplus).

We can use Figure 10-7 to illustrate the effect of an export quota. This figure is similar to Figure 10-6 because it deals with a large exporting country. Initially under free trade, the world trade price occurs at the intersection of Home export supply  $X$  and Foreign import demand  $M^{*}$ , at point  $B$  in panel (b) with exports of  $X_{1}$ . Now suppose that the Home country imposes a quota that limits its exports to the quantity  $\overline{X} < X_{1}$ . We can think of the export supply curve as a vertical line at the amount  $\overline{X}$ . A vertical line at  $\overline{X}$  would intersect Foreign import demand at the point  $C$ , leading to a higher world price of  $P_{2}^{*} > P^{W}$ .

That higher world price is earned by the Home producers. But because they export less  $(\overline{X}$  rather than the free trade amount  $X_{1}$ ), they sell more locally. Local sales can be found by subtracting exports of  $\overline{X}$  from the Home supply curve in panel (a), shifting the remaining Home supply left to the curve labeled  $S - \overline{X}$ . The intersection of

FIGURE 10-7

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/18d2e953a7f897f4d8b5aa07d9b0e0404b70b90c3628c7480da1b36b0e8cc2d0.jpg)

Export Quota for a Large Country The export quota leads to a vertical export supply curve above the quantity  $\overline{X}$  in panel (b). As a result, the world price increases from  $P^W$  to  $P_2^*$ . Because Home firms can export only the amount  $\overline{X}$ , the remaining home supply curve shifts left by that amount, as shown by  $S - \overline{X}$ . This remaining Home supply intersects Home demand at the price  $P_{2}$  in panel (a), which is lower than the initial world price of  $P^{W}$ . This increase in the world price is less than the upward shift in export supply of  $t$ . The deadweight loss for Home is the area of triangle  $(b + d)$ , while Home firms earn the quota rents of area  $(c + e)$ .

this remaining Home supply with Home demand occurs at the price  $P_{2}$  in panel (a), which is lower than the initial world price of  $P^{W}$ . As we found for the export tariff in Figure 10-6, the fall in the Home price leads to an increase in Home demand from  $D_{1}$  to  $D_{2}$ . That quantity is the amount that Home firms supply to the local market. The total amount supplied by Home firms is  $D_{2} + \overline{X} = S_{2}$ , which has fallen in relation to the free-trade supply of  $S_{1}$ . So we see that a side-effect of the export quota is to limit the total sales of Home firms.

Let's compare the welfare effects of the export quota with those of the export tariff. Home consumers gain the same amount of consumer surplus  $a$  due to lower domestic prices. The change in producer surplus is more complicated. If producers earned the lower price of  $P_{2}$  on all their quantity sold, as they do with the export tariff, then they would lose  $(a + b + c + d)$  in producer surplus. But under the export quota they also earn rents of  $(c + e)$  on their export sales, which offsets the loss in producer surplus. These rents equal the difference between the Home and world prices,  $P_{2}^{*} - P_{2}$ , times the amount exported  $\overline{X}$ . A portion of these rents—the area  $e$ —is the rise in the world price times the amount exported, or the terms-of-trade gain for the exporter; the remaining amount of rents—the area  $c$ —offsets some of the loss in producer surplus. The government does not collect any revenue under the export quota, because the firms themselves earn rents from the higher export prices.

The overall impact of the export quota is:

<table><tr><td>Rise in consumer surplus:</td><td>+ a</td></tr><tr><td>Fall in producer surplus:</td><td>-(a + b + c + d)</td></tr><tr><td>Rise in rents earned by producers:</td><td>+(c + e)</td></tr><tr><td>Rise in government revenue:</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Net effect on Home welfare:</td><td>e - (b + d)</td></tr></table>

To summarize, the overall effect of the export quota on the Home country welfare is the same as the export tariff, with a net effect on welfare of  $e - (b + d)$ . If this amount is positive, then Home gains from the export quota. The effects of the quota on Home firms and the government differ from those of the tariff. Under the export tariff the Home government earns revenue of  $(c + e)$ , while under the export quota that amount is earned instead as quota rents by Home firms.

This conclusion is the same as the one we reached in Chapter 8, when we examined the ways that import quotas can be allocated. One of those ways was by using a "voluntary" export restraint (VER), which is put in place by the exporting country rather than the importing country. The VER and the export quota are the same idea with different names. In both cases, the restriction on exports raises the world price. Firms in the exporting country can sell at that higher world price, so they earn the quota rents, with no effect on government revenue. In the following application, we look at how China used export quotas to limit its export of some mineral products.

# APPLICATION

# Chinese Export Policies in Mineral Products

Like many developing countries, China uses a wide variety of export policies. Export tariffs ranging from  $10\%$  to  $40\%$  are applied to steel products, for example, which create a source of revenue for the government. In addition, China has applied both tariffs and quotas to its exports of mineral products. The policies that China has applied to mineral exports have attracted international attention recently, since some of these minerals are essential to the production of goods in other countries. As we saw in Figures 10-6 and 10-7, export tariffs and export quotas both increase the world price, making it more expensive for other countries to obtain a product and at the same time benefiting the exporting country with a terms-of-trade gain.

In 2009, the United States, the European Union, and Mexico filed a case against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO), charging that the export tariffs and export quotas that China applied on bauxite, zinc, yellow phosphorus, and six other industrial minerals, distorted the pattern of international trade. Export restrictions of this type are banned under Article XI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (see Side Bar: Key Provisions of the GATT, Chapter 8). When China joined the WTO in 2001, it was required to eliminate its export restrictions, including those on minerals. But an exception to Article XI states that this rule does not apply to "export prohibitions or restrictions temporarily applied to prevent or relieve critical shortages of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting contracting party." For example, a country facing a food shortage can restrict its food exports to keep the food at home. In its response to this 2009 case, China claimed that this exception applied to its exports of industrial minerals; China claimed that it was restricting its exports of the minerals because they were needed by Chinese industries using these products (such as the solar panel industry), and also because the export quota would limit the total amount sold of these precious resources and leave more in the ground for future use. But in July 2011, the WTO ruled that this exception did not apply to China's exports of these products, and that it must remove its export restrictions on industrial minerals. China filed an appeal, but the WTO reaffirmed the ruling again in January 2012.

This legal battle at the WTO was closely watched around the world, because shortly after the case was filed in 2009, China also started applying export quotas to other mineral products: "rare earth" minerals, such as lanthanum (used in batteries and lighting) and neodymium (used in making permanent magnets, which are found in high-tech products ranging from smartphones to hybrid cars to wind turbines). At that time, China controlled more than  $95\%$  of the world production and exports of these minerals. The export quotas applied by China contributed to a rise in the world prices of these products. For example, the price of lanthanum went from  \$6 per kilogram in 2009 to$ 60 in 2010 to $151 in 2011, and then back down to \$36 in 2012. The high world prices made it profitable for other nations to supply the minerals: Australia opened a mine and the United States reopened a mine in the Mojave Desert that had closed a decade earlier for environmental reasons. The U.S. mine includes deposits of light rare earth elements, such as neodymium, as well as the heavy rare elements terbium, yttrium, and dysprosium (which are needed to manufacture wind turbines and solar cells). These new sources of supply led to the price drop in 2012.

In March 2012, the United States, the European Union, and Japan filed another WTO case against China charging that it applied unfair export restrictions on its rare earth minerals, as well as tungsten and molybdenum. The first step in such a case is for the parties involved (the United States, Europe, and Japan on one side; China on the other) to see whether the charges can be resolved through consultations at the WTO. Those consultations failed to satisfy either side, and in September 2012, the case went to a dispute settlement panel at the WTO. The Chinese government appealed to Article XX of the GATT, which allows for an exception to GATT rules in cases "relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources." But the WTO ruled against China, who is expected to appeal.

Regardless of the ultimate outcome of that case, it appears that China has already changed its policies on rare earth minerals. By the end of 2012, China realized that its policy of export quotas for rare earth minerals was not having the desired effect of maintaining high world prices. It therefore shifted away from a strict reliance on export quotas, and introduced subsidies to help producers who were losing money. These new policies are described in Headlines: China Signals Support for Rare Earths. The new subsidy policy might also lead to objections from the United States, the European Union, and Japan. But as we have seen earlier in this chapter, it is more difficult for the WTO to control subsidies (which are commonly used in agriculture) than to control export quotas.

A final feature of international trade in rare earth minerals is important to recognize: the mining and processing of these minerals poses an environmental risk, because rare earth minerals are frequently found with radioactive ores like thorium or uranium. Processing these minerals therefore leads to low-grade radioactive waste as a by-product. That aspect of rare earth minerals leads to protests against the establishment of new mines. The Lynas Corporation mine in Australia, mentioned in the Headlines article, processes the minerals obtained there in Malaysia. That processing facility was targeted by protesters in Malaysia, led by a retired math teacher named Tan Bun Teet. Although Mr. Tan and the other protestors did not succeed in preventing the processing facility from being opened, they did delay it and also put pressure on the company to ensure that the radioactive waste would be exported from Malaysia, in accordance with that country's laws. But where will this waste go? This environmental dilemma arises because of the exploding worldwide demand for high-tech products (including your own cell phone), whose manufacturing involves environmental risks. This case illustrates the potential interaction between international trade and the environment, a topic we examine in more detail in the next chapter.

# 7 High-Technology Export Subsidies

We turn now to consider high-technology final products. This sector of an economy also receives substantial assistance from government, with examples including subsidies to the aircraft industries in both the United States and Europe. In the United States, subsidies take the form of low-interest loans provided by the Export-Import

# China Signals Support for Rare Earths

China has changed its rare earths policy amid fears that its hard line on producers threatens its dominance of the global market for 17 key substances found in items from smartphones to missiles. In a move that Beijing describes as "promoting orderly development", China will provide direct subsidies to revive struggling producers—a tacit acknowledgment of the strategic importance of the industry. The subsidies represent a significant shift in China's policy of the past two years, which focused on restricting production of rare earths, closing down illegal mines, and tightening control of exports. These moves led to price fluctuations and slowing global demand.

Chen Zhanheng, of the China Rare Earths Industry Association, said the move would help the large, state-controlled rare earths companies the government is trying to promote. "In the long run, the policy can promote resource protection and effective utilisation of rare earths," said Mr. Chen. "[The subsidy] is aimed at supporting technological upgrades, energy conservation and environmental protection."

… Beijing's near monopoly in the strategic sector has raised concerns in Washington and Tokyo, particularly when China suspended rare earths shipments to Japan during a diplomatic dispute in 2010. That incident, combined with broader concerns about the reliability of Chinese supply, triggered a surge of investment in mines outside China, several of which are set to start producing next year. Lynas Corporation, an Australia-based miner, announced yesterday that its first shipment of rare earths ore had arrived in Malaysia, where it has a processing facility expected to start producing the substances in the first half of 2013.

Bank to foreign firms or governments that want to purchase aircraft from Seattle-based Boeing. (The Export-Import Bank is a U.S. government agency that finances export-related projects.) On the European side, government support for research and development and other subsidies are given to Airbus, which produces parts and assembles its finished products in a number of European countries. In Japan and South Korea, direct subsidies have been given to high-tech manufacturing firms that achieve certain targets for increasing their export sales. High-tech subsidies are given by many other countries, too.

Why do governments support their high-technology industries? In the case of agricultural products, subsidies are instituted primarily because of the political clout of those industries. Although politics plays a role in subsidies for high-tech industries, governments also subsidize these industries because they may create benefits that spill over to other firms in the economy. That is, governments believe that high-tech industry produces a positive externality. This argument for a subsidy is similar to the infant industry argument used to justify protective tariffs (see Chapter 9), except that the protection is applied to an export industry rather than an import-competing industry.

# "Strategic" Use of High-Tech Export Subsidies

In addition to the spillover argument for export subsidies, governments and industries also argue that export subsidies might give a strategic advantage to export firms that are competing with a small number of rivals in international markets. By a strategic advantage, we mean that the subsidized industry can compete more effectively with its rivals on the world market. Think of the aircraft industry, which currently has just two producers of large, wide-bodied airplanes: Boeing in the United States and Airbus in Europe. Each of these firms receives some type of subsidy from its government. If high-tech subsidies allow firms to compete more effectively and earn more profits in international markets, and if the extra profits are more than the amount of the subsidy, then the exporting country will obtain an overall benefit from the export subsidy, similar to the benefit that comes from a large country applying a tariff.

To examine whether countries can use their subsidies strategically, we use the assumption of imperfect competition. We already used this assumption in Chapter 9, in which we considered the cases of Home monopoly and Foreign monopoly. Now we allow for two firms in the market, which is called a duopoly. In that case, each firm can set the price and quantity of its output (and hence maximize its profits) based on the price and quantity decisions of the other firm. When a government uses subsidies to affect this interaction between firms and to increase the profits of its own domestic firm, the government is said to be acting strategically. In this section, we examine the effects of strategic export subsidies to determine whether profits of the exporting firm will rise enough to offset the cost of the subsidy to the government.

Because we now assume that certain high-tech industries operate in imperfectly competitive markets, we need to use a different set of tools to model their supply decisions than we have used thus far in this chapter. To capture the strategic decision making of two firms, we use game theory, the modeling of strategic interactions (games) between firms as they choose actions that will maximize their returns. The main goal in this section is to model the strategic interaction of high-tech firms in Home and Foreign, and then to see the impact of export subsidies on their respective decisions and payoffs.

To examine the effect of an export subsidy, we start with the free-trade situation, before any subsidies are in place. Suppose there are two firms that are competing for sales of a new type of aircraft. For example, Airbus sells the double-decker A380, and Boeing sells a smaller aircraft called the 787 Dreamliner (discussed later in the chapter). For convenience, we focus on the decision of each firm to produce a relatively new aircraft that competes with the other firm for sales to the rest of the world. By ignoring sales to firms in their own countries, we will not have to keep track of consumer surplus in the United States or Europe. Instead, the measure of welfare for these countries will depend only on the profits earned by Boeing or Airbus from their sales to the rest of the world.

Payoff Matrix In Figure 10-8, we show a payoff matrix for Boeing and Airbus, each of which has to decide whether to produce the new aircraft. Each quadrant of the matrix shows the profit earned by Boeing in the lower-left corner and the profits of Airbus in the upper-right corner. When both firms produce (upper-left quadrant), their prices are reduced through competition, and they both end up making negative profits (i.e., losses) of 5 million.

If Airbus produces the new aircraft and Boeing does not (lower-left quadrant), then Boeing earns nothing, whereas Airbus, the only supplier, earns high profits of  \$100 million. Conversely, if Boeing produces and Airbus does not (upper-right quadrant), Airbus earns nothing, and Boeing, now the only supplier, earns high profits of\$ 100 million. Finally, if both firms choose not to produce (lower-right quadrant), then they both earn profits of 0.

Nash Equilibrium With the pattern of payoffs shown in Figure 10-8, we want to determine what the outcome of this game between the two firms will be. At first glance, this seems like a difficult problem. It is hard for each firm to decide what to do without knowing whether the other firm is going to produce. To solve this problem, we use the concept of the Nash equilibrium, named after John Nash, a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics.

The idea of a Nash equilibrium is that each firm must make its own best decision, taking as given each possible action of the rival firm. When each firm is acting that way, the outcome of the game is a Nash equilibrium. That is, the action of each player is the best possible response to the action of the other player.

Best Strategy for Boeing To determine the Nash equilibrium, we proceed by checking each quadrant of the payoff matrix. Let us look at Boeing's possible strategies, starting with the case in which its rival, Airbus, chooses to produce. If Boeing knows that Airbus will produce, then Boeing needs to decide whether to produce. If Boeing produces, then it earns  $-\$ 5$  million (in the upper-left quadrant); if Boeing does not produce, then it earns 0 (in the lower-left quadrant). Therefore, if Airbus produces, then Boeing is better off not producing. This finding proves that having both firms produce is not a Nash equilibrium. Boeing would never stay in production, since it prefers to drop out of the market whenever Airbus produces.

Best Strategy for Airbus Let's continue with the case in which Boeing does not produce but Airbus does (lower-left quadrant of Figure 10-8). Is this the best strategy for Airbus? To check this, suppose that Airbus chooses instead not to produce. That would move us from the lower-left quadrant to the lower-right quadrant in Figure 10-8, meaning that Airbus's profits fall from 100 million to 0. This outcome is worse for Airbus, so it would not change its decision: it would still choose to produce. We conclude that the decision illustrated in the lower-left quadrant, with Airbus producing and Boeing not producing, is a Nash equilibrium because each firm is making its best decision given what the other is doing. When Airbus produces, then Boeing's best response is not to produce, and when Boeing does not produce, then Airbus's best response is to produce. There is no reason for either firm to change its behavior from the Nash equilibrium.

FIGURE 10-8

# Payoff Matrix Between Two

Firms The lower-left number in each quadrant shows the profits of Boeing, and the upper-right number shows the profits of Airbus. Each firm must decide whether to produce a new type of aircraft. A Nash equilibrium occurs when each firm is making its best decision, given the action of the other. For this pattern of payoffs, there are two Nash equilibria, in the upper-right and lower-left quadrants, where one firm produces and the other does not.

Multiple Equilibria Is it possible to find more than one Nash equilibrium? To check for this, we need to check the other quadrants in Figure 10-8. Let us try the case in the upper-right quadrant, where Boeing produces but Airbus does not. Consider Airbus making the decision to produce or not, given that Boeing produces, or Boeing making the decision to produce or not, given that Airbus does not produce. Using the same logic we have already gone through, you can confirm that neither firm would want to change the decision it has made as seen in the upper-right quadrant: if either firm changed its choice, its profits would fall. If Boeing decides not to produce, then its profits fall to 0 (from the upper-right to the lower-right quadrant), whereas if Airbus decides to produce, its profits fall to  $-\$ 5$  million (from the upper-right to the upper-left quadrant). So we conclude that the upper-right quadrant, with Boeing producing and Airbus not producing, is also a Nash equilibrium. When Boeing produces, then Airbus's best response is to not produce, and when Airbus does not produce, then Boeing's best response is to produce. Finally, by applying the same logic to the other quadrants, we can confirm that there are no more Nash equilibria.

When there are two Nash equilibria, there must be some force from outside the model that determines in which equilibrium we are. An example of one such force is the first mover advantage, which means that one firm is able to decide whether to produce before the other firm. If Boeing had this advantage, it would choose to produce, and Airbus, as the second mover, would not produce, so we would be in the upper-right quadrant. Let us suppose that is the Nash equilibrium from which we start. Because Airbus is not producing, it is making zero profits. In this situation, the government in Europe might want to try to change the Nash equilibrium so that Airbus would instead earn positive profits. That is, by providing subsidies to Airbus, we want to determine whether the payoffs in the matrix change such that the Nash equilibrium also changes.

The type of subsidy we consider in our model is a cash payment to Airbus. In practice, however, subsidies are of many kinds: Boeing has benefited from U.S. military contracts, where the research and development (R&D) done for those contracts has been used in its civilian aircraft, too. Airbus, on the other hand, has benefited from direct R&D subsidies to defray the "launch costs" of getting a new aircraft off the ground. Both companies have benefited from low-cost loans provided by their governments to purchasers of aircraft. Later in the chapter, we examine in more detail actual export subsidies that are used in the aircraft industry.

# Effect of a Subsidy to Airbus

Suppose the European governments provide a subsidy of  \$25 million to Airbus. With this subsidy in place, Airbus's profits will increase by\$ 25 million when it produces. In Figure 10-9, we add that amount to the payoffs for Airbus and check to see whether the Nash equilibria have changed. Recall that the free-trade Nash equilibria occur when one firm produces and the other does not.

Best Strategy for Airbus Let us start with the free-trade Nash equilibrium in which Boeing produces but Airbus does not (upper-right quadrant) and see whether it changes when Airbus receives a government subsidy. After the subsidy, that option is no longer a Nash equilibrium: if Boeing is producing, then Airbus is now better off by also producing because then it receives a  \$25 million subsidy from the government. With the subsidy, it will now earn\$ 20 million (\$5 million in negative profits plus the \$25 million subsidy) even when Boeing produces. Recall that in the original situation, if Boeing produced,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/5977696171c3bd3cb73caa5bddeb2810f5c37ac0c340ce41505024289ea50a1a.jpg)

FIGURE 10-9

Payoff Matrix with Foreign Subsidy When the European governments provide a subsidy of  \$25 million to Airbus, its profits increase by that much when it produces a new aircraft. Now there is only one Nash equilibrium, in the lower-left quadrant, with Airbus producing but Boeing not producing. The profits for Airbus have increased from 0 to\$ 125 million, while the subsidy cost only \$25 million, so there is a net gain of \$100 million in European welfare.

then Airbus would not choose to produce because otherwise it would lose  \$5 million. With the subsidy, Airbus now earns\$ 20 million by producing instead of losing 5 million.

Best Strategy for Boeing Is this new position a Nash equilibrium? To answer that, we need to see whether Boeing would still be making the right decision given that Airbus is producing. When Airbus produces, Boeing loses  \$5 million when it produces (upper-left quadrant) but loses nothing when it does not produce (lower-left quadrant). Therefore, Boeing will want to drop out of the market. Once Boeing makes the decision not to produce, Airbus's decision doesn't change. It still chooses to produce, but its payoff increases dramatically from\$ 20 million to 125 million, and we move to the lower-left quadrant, with Airbus producing and Boeing not.

Nash Equilibrium You can readily check that the lower-left quadrant is a unique Nash equilibrium: each firm is making its best decision, given the action of the other. Furthermore, it is the only Nash equilibrium. The effect of the European governments' subsidy has been to shift the equilibrium from having Boeing as the only producer (where we started, in the upper-right quadrant) to having Airbus as the only producer (in the lower-left quadrant).

European Welfare The European subsidy has had a big impact on the equilibrium of the game being played between the two firms. But can we necessarily conclude that Europe is better off? To evaluate that, we need to add up the welfare of the various parties involved, much as we did earlier in the chapter.

The calculation of European welfare is simplified, however, because of our assumption that production is for export to the rest of the world. From Europe's point of view, we do not need to worry about the effect of the subsidy on consumer surplus in its own market. The only two items left to evaluate, then, are the profits for Airbus from its sales to the rest of the world and the cost of the subsidy to the European government.

Airbus's profits have increased from 0 (when it was not producing but Boeing was) to  \$125 million (now that Airbus is producing but Boeing is not). The revenue cost of the subsidy to Europe is\$ 25 million. Therefore, the net effect of the subsidy on European welfare is

Rise in producer surplus: +125

Fall in government revenue: -25

Net effect on European welfare: + 100

In this case, the subsidy led to a net gain in European welfare because the increase in profits for Airbus is more than the cost of the subsidy.[10]

# Subsidy with Cost Advantage for Boeing

Our finding that the subsidy can raise European welfare depends on the numbers we assumed so far, however. Let us now consider another case in which Boeing has a cost advantage over Airbus. In this case, we assume that the cost advantage is the result not of U.S. subsidies but of U.S. comparative advantage in aircraft production.

When Boeing has a cost advantage in aircraft production, the payoff matrix is as shown in Figure 10-10. Boeing earns profits of  \$5 million when both firms produce and profits of\$ 125 million when Airbus does not produce. There is now only one Nash equilibrium, and it is in the upper-right quadrant in which Boeing produces and Airbus does not. The alternative free-trade Nash equilibrium in Figure 10-8 (in which Airbus produces and Boeing does not) is no longer a Nash equilibrium because—with the cost advantage we are now assuming Boeing has, even if Airbus chooses to produce—it is better for Boeing to produce and earn profits of 5 million than not produce and earn 0 profits.

Now suppose, once again, that the European governments provide a 25 million subsidy to Airbus. We add that amount to the payoffs of Airbus when it produces (still assuming that Boeing has a cost advantage over Airbus), as shown in Figure 10-11.

Best Strategy for Airbus Let's see how the subsidy has affected the previous Nash equilibrium in which Boeing produces and Airbus does not (upper-right quadrant). Given that Boeing produces, the decision not to produce is no longer the best one for Airbus: with the subsidy now in place and Boeing producing, Airbus's best decision is to produce and to earn profits of 20 million (upper-left quadrant) rather than 0.

Best Strategy for Boeing Is this new position a Nash equilibrium? Once again, we need to check to see whether, given Airbus's new post-subsidy decision to produce, Boeing is still making the right decision. Given that Airbus produces, then Boeing earns profits of 5 million when it produces and 0 when it does not. Therefore,

# FIGURE 10-10

Another Payoff Matrix, with Boeing Cost Advantage If Boeing has a cost advantage in the production of aircraft, the payoffs are as shown here. Boeing earns profits of  \$5 million when both firms are producing and profits of\$ 125 million when Airbus does not produce. Now there is only one Nash equilibrium, in the upper-right quadrant, where Boeing produces and Airbus does not.

FIGURE 10-11

Another Payoff Matrix with Foreign Subsidy When the European governments provide a subsidy of  \$25 million to Airbus, its profits increase by that much when it produces. Now the only Nash equilibrium is in the upper-left quadrant, where both firms produce. The profits for Airbus have increased from 0 to\$ 20 million, but the subsidy costs \$25 million, so there is a net loss of \$5 million in European welfare.

Boeing will stay in the market, and we have proved that having both firms produce is a Nash equilibrium.

European Welfare Once Again When Boeing has a cost advantage, the European subsidy allows Airbus to enter the market, but it has not resulted in the exit of Boeing as it did in the earlier no-cost-advantage scenario. Let us evaluate the effect on European welfare under these circumstances.

Airbus's profits have increased from 0 (when it was not producing, but Boeing was) to 20 (now that both firms are producing). The revenue cost of the subsidy to Europe is still 25. Therefore, the net effect of the subsidy on European welfare is

Rise in producer profits: +20

Fall in government revenue: -25

Net effect on European welfare: - 5

When Boeing has a cost advantage, then, the subsidy leads to a net loss in European welfare because the increase in profits for Airbus is less than the cost of the subsidy.

Summary The lesson that we should draw from these various examples is that under conditions of imperfect competition, a subsidy by one government to its exporting firm might increase welfare for its nation, but it might not. Although profits for the exporting firm certainly rise, there is an increase in welfare only if profits rise by more than the cost of the subsidy. This condition is more likely to be satisfied if the subsidy leads to the exit of the other firm from the market. In that case, the profits earned by the single firm could very well exceed the cost of the subsidy. When both firms remain in the market after the subsidy, however, it is unlikely that the increase in profits for the subsidized firm will exceed the subsidy cost. In the following application, we are especially interested in whether subsidies in the aircraft industry have kept one firm out of a market segment in which another produces.

# APPLICATION

# Subsidies to Commercial Aircraft

In the large passenger aircraft industry, there have been just three competitors: Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas in the United States and Airbus in Europe. The former two companies merged on August 1, 1997, so the industry effectively became a duopoly.

The United States and Europe have used various types of subsidies to support their respective firms. First, there are indirect subsidies that arise because in the production of civilian and military aircraft, the research and development (R&D) for the military versions effectively subsidize R&D for the civilian aircraft. These indirect subsidies have benefited both McDonnell-Douglas and Boeing in the United States. Second, the government might directly subsidize the R&D costs of a new aircraft, as Europe subsidizes R&D at Airbus. Third, the government can subsidize the interest rates that aircraft buyers pay when they borrow money to purchase aircraft. Europe and the United States both provide such low-interest loans, for instance, through the Export-Import Bank in the United States as mentioned previously.

1992 Agreement Recognizing that these subsidies are ultimately costly, the United States and the European Community reached an agreement to limit them in 1992. The main features of this agreement are summarized in Table 10-2. Development subsidies are limited to  $33\%$  of the total development costs of a new aircraft, and it is expected that the aircraft manufacturers will repay these subsidies at the government interest rate. In addition, the agreement limits indirect (military) subsidies to not more than  $4\%$  of any firm's annual sales, prohibits production subsidies, and limits the ability of government agencies to subsidize the interest rate on purchases of aircraft. According to one estimate, this agreement reduced subsidies by between  $7.5\%$  and  $12.5\%$  of the costs of production. As a result of the reduction in subsidies, prices for aircraft rose by somewhere between  $3.1\%$  and  $8.8\%$ . This agreement between the United States and Europe benefited the countries' governments because they no longer had to spend the money on the subsidies, and most likely also benefited the aircraft companies because prices rose, but the higher prices led to welfare losses for the purchasing countries.

The Superjumbo There are recent claims that the terms of the 1992 agreement were violated by Airbus as it launched its newest aircraft: the double-decker A380, which is even larger than the Boeing 747 and will compete directly with the 747 in long flights. This "superjumbo" aircraft carries up to 555 passengers and consists of two passenger decks for its entire length. Its first test flight in Europe took place in April 2005, and its first commercial flight to the United States was in March 2007. The expenditures to develop the A380 are estimated to have been  \$12 billion, one-third of which the governments of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Finland, and the United Kingdom are expected to pay. The European governments provided some\$ 3.5 billion in low-interest loans to cover development costs. In 2005 both the United States and the European Union filed countercomplaints at the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding illegal subsidies by the other party to their respective aircraft producers. Europe was accused of "illegally" subsidizing the A380, while the United States was accused of subsidizing the development of Boeing's 787 commercial jet. The complaints at the WTO have been going on since 2004, as discussed in Headlines: EU Seeks 12 billion from U.S. over Boeing Aid.

Both Airbus and Boeing have filed cases against each other at the WTO, claiming that the subsidies given for the A380 and the 787 aircraft violated the terms of the 1992 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. In bringing the initial case to the WTO in 2004, the United States declared that it would no longer abide by the 1992 Agreement, which the United States felt had outlived its usefulness. Over the years, the WTO has ruled in favor of both companies, finding that the European Union gave up to 18 billion in subsidized financing to Airbus, while the United States

# TABLE 10-2

# Provisions of the 1992 Agreement between the United States and the European

Community on Trade in Civil Aircraft This table shows the major provisions of a 1992 agreement between the United States and Europe that limited the subsidies provided to the development and production of civilian aircraft.

# Aircraft Covered

- All aircraft of 100 seats or larger are subject to the provisions of the agreement.

# Direct Support Levels

- Funds advanced by governments for aircraft development may not exceed  $33\%$  of total development costs and are to be provided only to programs in which there is a reasonable expectation of recoupment within 17 years.

# Interest Rates

Airbus will repay the first  $25\%$  of total development costs at the government cost of borrowing within 17 years of first disbursement; the remaining  $8\%$  will be repaid at the government cost of borrowing plus  $1\%$  within 17 years of first disbursement.

# Indirect Supports

- Both sides agree that indirect (i.e., military) supports should neither confer unfair advantage on manufacturers of civil aircraft nor lead to distortions in international trade in such aircraft.
Identifiable benefits from indirect support are limited to  $3\%$  of the value of industry-wide turnover in each signatory and  $4\%$  of the value of each firm's annual sales. Benefits will primarily be calculated as cost reductions in the development of a civil aircraft program realized from technology acquired through government R&D programs.

# Escape Clause on Emergency Aid

- Either side can temporarily derogate from the agreement, with the exception of the development support provisions, if survival and financial viability of an aircraft manufacturer are in jeopardy. Any such withdrawal would require consultations with representatives of the other side, full disclosure of information to justify the withdrawal, and full explanation of the remedy to be used.

# Production Supports

- No further production subsidies are allowed.

# Dispute Settlement Mechanisms

- Both sides will consult at least twice a year to ensure the functioning of the agreement. Either side may request consultations related to the agreement at any time. Such consultations must be held no later than 30 days after they are requested.

gave up to 4 billion in subsidized financing to Boeing. Both governments are now requesting that they be permitted to apply "countermeasures" against the other countries, which means that they can apply tariffs against products imported from those countries in retaliation for the subsidies. We do not know at this point whether these tariffs will be permitted, and it will probably be years before this complex case is ever resolved at the WTO.

National Welfare Will the development subsidies provided by the European governments to the Airbus A380 increase their national welfare? From the theory presented previously, that outcome is more likely to happen if Airbus is the only firm producing in that market. And such is the case, because Boeing did not try to produce a double-decker aircraft to compete with the A380. Instead, it modified its 747 jumbo jet model to compete with the A380, and it focused its R&D on its new 787 Dreamliner, a midsized (250-passenger), wide-bodied aircraft.

Because Boeing did not enter the market with its own double-decker aircraft, it is possible that the profits earned by Airbus will be large enough to cover the subsidy costs, the criterion for an increase in national welfare. But that outcome is certainly not guaranteed. The profits earned by Airbus on the A380 will depend on how many aircraft are sold and at what price. Airbus has stated that it needs to produce at least

250 planes to cover its development costs but that it expects to sell 1,500 A380s over the next 20 years. As of April 2013, it had delivered 101 of 262 aircraft ordered and was experiencing a slow-down in new orders because of small cracks discovered in the aircraft wings. These cracks have been traced to faulty brackets connecting the wings to the body, and all A380 aircraft in operation will be serviced to repair this defect. Boeing believes that market demand for the A380 superjumbo will not exceed 700 aircraft over the next 20 years. It remains to be seen whether the subsidies provided by the European Union for the A380 will ultimately pay off.

Boeing has its own share of difficulties with the production of the 787 Dreamliner, which was initially scheduled for delivery in 2008, but did not make its first flight until December 15, 2009. Boeing outsourced many of the components of the 787 to firms in other countries, but then had difficulty in assembling these components back in the United States, which led to the delay in its delivery. Then, in January 2013, there were battery fires in two

787 aircraft owned by Japan Air and United Airlines. Those fires led to the grounding of all 787 aircraft until the battery problem could be addressed and solved. The planes were allowed to fly again in June 2013. Finally, note that Airbus has produced a competitor for the 787 Dreamliner, the A350 wide-bodied jet, which had its maiden take-off on June 14, 2013. Boeing and Airbus will be in direct competition for customers for these new aircraft. France, Germany, and Britain pledged 4.1 billion in launch funding for the A350, and it remains to be seen whether this funding will lead to another legal case at the WTO. The fact that both firms are producing a new midsized, wide-bodied aircraft makes it less likely that either country will recoup the subsidies provided and experience a rise in national welfare from the subsidies.

# 8 Conclusions

Countries use export subsidies in a wide range of industries, including agriculture, mining, and high technology. For agriculture, the underlying motivation for the export subsidies is to prop up food prices, thereby raising the real incomes of farmers. This motivation was also discussed at the end of Chapter 3 using the specific-factors model. In this chapter, we used supply and demand curves to analyze the effect of export subsidies, but obtain the same result as in the specific-factors model: export subsidies raise prices for producers, thereby increasing their real income (in the specific-factors model) and their producer surplus (using supply curves).

Shifting income toward farmers comes with a cost to consumers, however, because of the higher food prices in the exporting country. When we add up the loss in consumer surplus, the gain in producer surplus, and the revenue cost of the subsidy, we obtain a net loss for the exporting country as a result of the subsidy. This deadweight loss is similar to that from a tariff in a small country. On the other hand, for a large country, an import tariff and an export subsidy have different welfare implications. Both policies lead to a rise in domestic prices (of either the import good or the export good) and a fall in world prices. For an export subsidy, however, the fall in world prices is a terms-of-trade loss for the exporting country. This means that applying an export subsidy in a large exporting country leads to even greater losses than applying

# EU Seeks 12 billion from US over Boeing Aid

The EU has asked the World Trade Organisation for permission to levy up to 12bn in punitive tariffs against US goods for Washington's failure to dismantle illegal subsidies for Boeing, the aircraft maker. The EU request is the highest on record for so-called countermeasures in a WTO trade case and marks the latest turn in a eight year, tit-for-tat fight between the world's largest civil aircraft…

The US in December made a similar demand for up to 10bn in countermeasures against the EU after it complained that European governments had not complied with a WTO ruling to remove illegal subsidies for Airbus. Under WTO rules, countermeasures allow a governmeant to raise tariffs on goods from another country to recoup damages. The US and EU have previously hit politically sensitive items, such as Florida orange juice and French cheese.

The Boeing-Airbus dispute dates back to 2004, when each government filed complaints at the WTO, saying the other had lavished vast amounts of illegal subsidies on its civil aircraft maker, such as cheap financing, tax breaks, defense contracts and research and development aid. After years of litigation, both sides were ultimately found to have been guilty, although the sums for Airbus, at about 18bn, were more than four-times higher.

Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the US trade representative, said: "It is truly difficult to see how the EU characterises the finding against the US as the "worst loss" ever. "The WTO found that the EU granted 18bn in subsidised financing, which caused 342 lost sales for the United States. The WTO found 2bn to 4bn, mostly in subsidised research, against the United States, with 118 lost sales for Airbus," she added…

Airbus said the company was "grateful to the EU Commission for taking consequential action," and urged Boeing to come to the bargaining table. "We regret that Boeing continues a legal battle that should have long been resolved by a mutual agreement. We made offers time and again but are ready to fight it through if the other side wishes to do so."

it to a small country: there is no possibility of gain, as we found for a large-country import tariff.

The losses arising from an export subsidy, for either a small or a large country, are less severe when we instead consider production subsidies. A production subsidy provides a farmer with an extra payment for every unit produced, regardless of whether it is sold at home or abroad. So consumer prices do not change from their world level. Since consumer prices are not affected, exports increase only because domestic supply increases. In other words, the excess supply in response to production subsidies will indirectly spill over into international markets but production subsidies do not exclusively subsidize those exports (as export subsidies do). For these reasons, the losses arising from production subsidies in an exporting country are less severe than the losses arising from export subsidies. At the Hong Kong meeting of the WTO in December 2005, countries agreed to eliminate export subsidies in agriculture by 2013, but that agreement was not ratified and has not been implemented. In addition, the countries made a much weaker agreement for production subsidies and other domestic farm supports.

The losses experienced by an exporting country due to subsidies are reversed when countries instead use export tariffs, as occurs for some natural resource products. With export tariffs in a large country, the exporter obtains a terms-of-trade gain through restricting supply of its exports and driving up the world price. This terms-of-trade gain comes at the expense of its trade partners who are buying the products, so like an import tariff, and export tariff is a "beggar thy neighbor" policy.

The losses experienced by an exporting country due to subsidies also change when we consider high-technology industries, operating under imperfect competition. In this chapter, we examined an international duopoly (two firms) producing a good for sale in the rest of the world: Boeing and Airbus, competing for sales of a new aircraft. We showed that it is possible for an export subsidy to lead to gains for the exporting country, by increasing the profits earned by the exporting firms by more than the cost of the subsidy. But that result often requires the subsidy to force the other firm out of the market, which does not necessarily occur. In this case, if both firms stay in the market and are subsidized by their governments, then it is unlikely that the subsidies are in the national interest of either the United States or the European Union; instead, the countries purchasing the aircraft gain because of the lower price, while the United States and Europe lose as a result of the costs of the subsidies.

# KEY POINTS

1. An export subsidy leads to a fall in welfare for a small exporting country facing a fixed world price. The drop in welfare is a deadweight loss and is composed of a consumption and production loss, similar to an import tariff for a small country.
2. In the large-country case, an export subsidy lowers the price of that product in the rest of the world. The decrease in the export price is a terms-of-trade loss for the exporting country. Therefore, the welfare of the exporters decreases because of both the deadweight loss of the subsidy and the terms-of-trade loss. This is in contrast to the effects of an import tariff in the large-country case, which generates a terms-of-trade gain for the importing country.
3. Export subsidies applied by a large country create a benefit for importing countries in the rest of the world, by lowering their import prices. Therefore, the removal of these subsidy programs has an adverse effect on those countries. In fact, many of the poorest countries are net food importers that will face higher prices as agricultural subsidies in the European Union and the United States are removed.
4. Production subsidies to domestic producers also have the effect of increasing domestic production. However, consumers are unaffected by these subsidies. As a result, the deadweight loss of a production subsidy is less than that for an equal export subsidy, and the terms-of-trade loss is also smaller.
5. Export tariffs applied by a large country create a terms-of-trade gain for these countries, by raising the price of their export product. In addition, the export tariff creates a deadweight loss. If the terms-of-trade gain exceeds the deadweight loss, then the exporting countries gain overall.
6. It is common for countries to provide subsidies to their high-technology industries because governments believe that these subsidies can create a strategic advantage for their firms in international markets. Because these industries often have only a few global competitors, we use game theory (the study of strategic interactions) to determine how firms make their decisions under imperfect competition.
7. A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which each player is making the best response to the action of the other player. In a game with multiple Nash equilibria, the outcome can depend on an external factor, such as the ability of one player to make the first move.
8. Export subsidies can affect the Nash equilibrium of a game by altering the profits of the firms. If a subsidy increases the profits to a firm by more than the subsidy cost, then it is worthwhile for a government to undertake the subsidy. As we have seen, though, subsidies are not always worthwhile unless they can induce the competing firm to exit the market altogether, which may not occur.

# PROBLEMS

1. Describe the impact of each of the following goals from the Hong Kong WTO meeting on (i) domestic prices and welfare of the country taking the action and (ii) world prices and welfare for the partner countries.

a. Elimination of agriculture export subsidies b. Reduction of agricultural tariffs

c. Duty-free, quota-free access for  $97\%$  of goods originating in the world's least developed countries

2. Consider a large country with export subsidies in place for agriculture. Suppose the country changes its policy and decides to cut its subsidies in half.

a. Are there gains or losses to the large country, or is it ambiguous? What is the impact on domestic prices for agriculture and on the world price?

b. Suppose a small food-importing country abroad responds to the lowered subsidies by lowering its tariffs on agriculture by the same amount. Are there gains or losses to the small country, or is it ambiguous? Explain.

c. Suppose a large food-importing country abroad reciprocates by lowering its tariffs on agricultural goods by the same amount. Are there gains or losses to this large country, or is it ambiguous? Explain.

3. Suppose Home is a small exporter of wheat. At the world price of \$100 per ton, Home grows export 20 tons. Now suppose the Home government decides to support its domestic producer with an export subsidy of \$40 per ton. Use the following figure to answer these questions.

b. Calculate the effect of the export subsidy on consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government revenue.

c. Calculate the overall net effect of the export subsidy on Home welfare.

4. Refer to Problem 3. Rather than a small exporter of wheat, suppose that Home is a large country. Continue to assume that the free-trade world price is \$100 per ton and that the Home government provides the domestic producer with an export subsidy in the amount of \$40 per ton. Because of the export subsidy, the local price increases to \$120, while the foreign market price declines to \$80 per ton. Use the following figure to answer these questions.

b. Calculate the effect of the export subsidy on consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government revenue.

c. Calculate the overall net effect of the export subsidy on Home welfare. Is the large country better or worse off as compared to the small country with the export subsidy? Explain.

5. Refer to Problem 3. Suppose Home is a small exporter of wheat. At the world price of \$100 per ton, Home growers export 20 tons. But rather than an export subsidy, suppose the Home government provides its domestic producer with a production subsidy of \$40 per ton. Use the following figure to answer these questions.

b. Calculate the effect of the production subsidy on consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government revenue.

c. Calculate the overall net effect of the production subsidy on Home welfare. Is the cost of the production subsidy more or less than the cost of the export subsidy for the small country? Explain.

6. Explain why the WTO is more concerned with the use of direct export subsidies than production subsidies in achieving the same level of domestic support.
7. Boeing and Airbus are the world's only major producers of large, wide-bodied aircraft. But with the cost of fuel increasing and changing demand in the airline industry, the need for smaller regional jets has increased. Suppose that both firms must decide whether they will produce a smaller plane. We will assume that Boeing has a slight cost advantage over Airbus in both large and small planes, as shown in the payoff matrix below (in millions of U.S. dollars). Assume that each producer chooses to produce only large, only small, or no planes at all.

a. What is the Nash equilibrium of this game?

b. Are there multiple equilibria? If so, explain why. Hint: Guess at an equilibrium and then check whether either firm would want to change its action, given the action of the other firm. Remember that Boeing can change only its own action, which means moving up or down a column, and likewise, Airbus can change only its own action, which means moving back or forth on a row.

8. Refer to Problem 7. Now suppose the European government wants Airbus to be the sole producer in the lucrative small-aircraft market. Then answer the following: a. What is the minimum amount of subsidy that Airbus must receive when it produces small aircraft to ensure that outcome as the unique Nash equilibrium?

b. Is it worthwhile for the European government to undertake this subsidy?

9. Here we examine the effects of domestic sales taxes on the market for exports, as an example of the "targeting principle." For example, in the domestic market, there are heavy taxes on the purchase of cigarettes. Meanwhile, the United States has several very large cigarette companies that export their products abroad.

a. What is the effect of the sales tax on the quantity of cigarette exports from the United States? Hint: Your answer should parallel the case of production subsidies but for a consumption tax instead.

b. How does the change in exports, if any, due to the sales tax compare with the effect of an export subsidy on cigarettes?

10. Refer to Problem 9. Based on your answer there, would foreign countries have a reason to object to the use of a sales tax on cigarettes by the United States? Based on your knowledge of the GATT/WTO provisions (see Side Bar: Key Provisions of the GATT in Chapter 8), are foreign countries entitled to object to the use of such a tax?
11. To improve national welfare, a large country would do better to implement an export subsidy rather than an import tariff. Is this true or false? Explain why.
12. Who gains and who loses when governments in Europe and the United States provide subsidies to Airbus and Boeing?
13. Provide motivations for the use of export subsidies. Does your answer depend on whether firms compete under perfect or imperfect competition?
