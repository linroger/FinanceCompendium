# The Global Macroeconomy

So much of barbarism, however, still remains in the transactions of most civilized nations, that almost all independent countries choose to assert their nationality by having, to their inconvenience and that of their neighbors, a peculiar currency of their own.

John Stuart Mill

Neither a borrower nor a lender be; / For loan oft loseth both itself and friend. / And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.

Polonius, in William Shakespeare's Hamlet

History, in general, only informs us of what bad government is.

Thomas Jefferson

International macroeconomics is devoted to the study of large-scale economic interactions among interdependent economies. It is international because a deeper exploration of the interconnections among nations is essential to understanding how the global economy works. It is macroeconomic because it focuses on key economy-wide variables, such as exchange rates, prices, interest rates, income, wealth, and the current account. In the chapters that follow, we use familiar macroeconomic ideas to examine the main features of the global macroeconomy.

The preceding quotations indicate that the broad range of topics and issues in international macroeconomics can be reduced to three key elements: the world has many monies (not one), countries are financially integrated (not isolated), and in this context economic policy choices are made (but not always very well).

Money John Stuart Mill echoes the complaints of many exasperated travelers and traders when he bemoans the profusion of different monies around the world. Mill's vision of a world with a single currency is even more distant today: in his day, the number of currencies was far smaller than the

3 Government and Institutions: Policies and Performance

4 Conclusions more than 150 currencies in use today. Why do all these monies exist, and what purposes do they serve? How do they affect the working of our global economy? What are the causes and consequences of the changing value of one currency against another? Do the benefits of having a national currency outweigh the costs?

Finance William Shakespeare's Polonius would surely be distressed by the sight of the mounting debts owed by the United States and other borrower countries to the rest of world. For him, happiness meant financial isolation, with income exactly equal to expenditure. Over the centuries, however, this has been a minority view among individuals and among nations. Today, the scale of international financial transactions has risen to record levels as capital has become ever more mobile internationally. Why do all these transactions occur, and what purposes do they serve? Who lends to whom, and why? Why are some debts paid but not others? Does the free flow of finance have costs as well as benefits?

Policy Thomas Jefferson's assessment of government may be extreme, but looking at economic outcomes around the world today, it surely contains some truth. If government policies were always optimal, recessions never happened, currencies never crashed, and debts were never in default … well, that would be a nice world to inhabit. The reality—all too apparent after the global financial crisis of 2008—is that policy making is frequently not optimal, even at the best of times in the best-run countries. And in the worst run countries, poverty, underinvestment, hyperinflation, crises, and debt problems are common events. How do exchange rates and international capital flows affect an economy? How can policy makers avoid bad economic outcomes and formulate better monetary and fiscal policies? What are the trade-offs for each policy decision? Is there even a single "right" approach to the many intricate economic problems facing interdependent nations?

Many fundamental questions like these must be answered if we are to understand the economic world around us. To that end, the chapters that follow combine economic theory with compelling empirical evidence to explain the workings of today's global macroeconomy. This introductory chapter briefly explains the road ahead.

# 1 Foreign Exchange: Currencies and Crises

In most branches of economics, and even in the study of international trade, it is common to assume that all goods are priced in a common currency. Despite this unrealistic assumption, such analysis delivers important insights into the workings of the global economy.

In the real world, however, countries have different currencies, and a complete understanding of how a country's economy works requires that we study the exchange rate, the price of foreign currency. Because products and investments move across borders, fluctuations in exchange rates have significant effects on the relative prices of home and foreign goods (such as autos and clothing), services (such as insurance and tourism), and assets (such as equities and bonds). We start our analysis of the global economy with the theory of exchange rates, and learn how and why they fluctuate. In later chapters, we'll see why exchange rates matter for economic outcomes and why they are an important focus of economic policy making.

# How Exchange Rates Behave

In studying exchange rates, it is important to understand the types of behavior that any theory of exchange rate determination must explain. Figure 12-1 illustrates some basic facts about exchange rates. Panel (a) shows the exchange rate of China with the United States, in yuan per U.S. dollar  $(\mathbb{S})$ . Panel (b) shows the exchange rate of the United States with the Eurozone, in U.S. dollars per euro.

The behavior of the two exchange rates is very different. The yuan-dollar rate is almost flat. In fact, for many years it was literally unchanged, day after day, at 8.28 yuan/$. Finally, on July 23, 2005, it dropped exactly  $2\%$ . Then it followed a fairly smooth, slow downward trend for a while: by September 2008 (when the global financial crisis began), it had fallen a further  $15\%$ . After the crisis, it reverted to a flat line once again at 6.83 yuan/$, and then on June 21, 2010, it resumed a gradual slow decline. During the period shown, the daily average absolute change in the exchange rate was less than five-hundredths of one percent  $(0.05\%)$ .

Major Exchange Rates The chart shows two key exchange rates from 2003 to 2012. The China-U.S. exchange rate varies little and would be considered a fixed exchange rate, despite a period when it followed a gradual trend. The U.S.-Eurozone exchange rate varies a lot and would be considered a floating exchange rate.

Note: For comparative purposes, the two vertical scales have the same proportions: the maximum is twice the minimum.

100 Chinese yuan, U.S. dollars, Eurozone euros

In contrast, the euro-dollar exchange rate experienced much wider fluctuations over the same period. On a daily basis, the average absolute change in this exchange rate was one-third of one percent (0.33\%), about 6 or 7 times as large as the average change in the yuan-dollar rate.

Based on such clearly visible differences in exchange rate behavior, economists divide the world into two groups of countries: those with fixed (or pegged) exchange rates and those with floating (or flexible) exchange rates. In Figure 12-1, China's exchange rate with the United States would be considered fixed. It was officially set at a fixed exchange rate with the dollar until July 2005, and again in 2008-10, but even at other times its very limited range of movement was so controlled that it was effectively "fixed."² In contrast, the euro-dollar exchange rate is a floating exchange rate, one that moves up and down over a much wider range.

Key Topics How are exchange rates determined? Why do some exchange rates fluctuate sharply in the short run, while others remain almost constant? What explains why exchange rates rise, fall, or stay flat in the long run?

# Why Exchange Rates Matter

Changes in exchange rates affect an economy in two ways:

Changes in exchange rates cause a change in the international relative prices of goods. That is, one country's goods and services become more or less expensive relative to another's when expressed in a common unit of currency. For example, in 2011 Spiegel interviewed one Swiss cheesemaker:

When Hans Stadelmann talks about currency speculators, it seems like two worlds are colliding… . Five men are working at the boilers, making the most popular Swiss cheese in Germany according to a traditional recipe … then there are the international financial markets, that abstract global entity whose actors have decided that the Swiss franc is a safe investment and, in doing so, have pushed the currency's value to record levels… . A year back, one euro was worth 1.35 francs. Two weeks ago, the value was 1-to-1. This presents a problem for Stadelmann. About  $40\%$  of his products are exported, most of them to EU countries. In order to keep his earnings level in francs, he's being forced to charge higher prices in euros—and not all of his customers are willing to pay them. 'I'm already selling less, and I'm afraid it's going to get much worse,' Stadelmann says. And it's not just his company he's worried about. 'I get my milk from 50 small family farmers,' he says. 'If I close up shop, I'd be destroying the livelihoods of 50 families.'

Changes in exchange rates can cause a change in the international relative prices of assets. These fluctuations in wealth can then affect firms, governments, and individuals. For example, in June 2010, Swiss investors held \$397 billion of U.S. securities, when \$1 was worth 1.05 Swiss francs (SFr). So these assets were worth 1.05 times 397, or SFr 417 billion. One year later 1 was worth only SFr 0.85, so the same securities would have been worth just 0.85 times 397 or SFr 337 billion, all else equal. That capital loss of SFr 80 billion (about 20\%) came about purely because of exchange rate changes. Although other factors affect securities values in domestic transactions with a single currency, all cross-border transactions involving two currencies are strongly affected by exchange rates as well.^{4}

Key Topics How do exchange rates affect the real economy? How do changes in exchange rates affect international prices, the demand for goods from different countries, and hence the levels of national output? How do changes in exchange rates affect the values of foreign assets, and hence change national wealth?

# When Exchange Rates Misbehave

Even after studying how exchange rates behave and why they matter, we still face the challenge of explaining one type of event that is almost guaranteed to put exchange rates front and center in the news: an exchange rate crisis. In such a crisis, a currency experiences a sudden and pronounced loss of value against another currency, following a period in which the exchange rate had been fixed or relatively stable.

One of the most dramatic currency crises in recent history occurred in Argentina from December 2001 to January 2002. For a decade, the Argentine peso had been fixed to the U.S. dollar at a one-to-one rate of exchange. But in January 2002, the fixed exchange rate became a floating exchange rate. A few months later, 1 Argentine peso, which had been worth one U.S. dollar prior to 2002, had fallen in value to just 0.25 (equivalently, the price of a U.S. dollar rose from 1 peso to almost 4 pesos).

The drama was not confined to the foreign exchange market. The Argentine government declared a then-record default (i.e., a suspension of payments) on its 155 billion of debt; the financial system was in a state of near closure for months; inflation climbed; output collapsed and unemployment soared; and more than 50\% of Argentine households fell below the poverty line. At the height of the crisis, violence flared and the country had five presidents in the space of two weeks.

Argentina's experience was extreme but hardly unique. Exchange rate crises are fairly common. Figure 12-2 lists 27 exchange rate crises in the 12-year period from 1997 to 2011. In almost all cases, a fairly stable exchange rate experienced a large and sudden change. The year 1997 was especially eventful, with seven crises, five of them in East Asia. The Indonesian rupiah lost  $49\%$  of its U.S. dollar value, but severe collapses also occurred in Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Other notable crises during this period included Liberia in 1998, Russia in 1998, and Brazil in 1999. More recently, Iceland and Ukraine saw their exchange rates crash during the global financial crisis of 2008 (see Headlines: Economic Crisis in Iceland).

Crisis episodes display some regular patterns. Output typically falls, banking and debt problems emerge, households and firms suffer. In addition, political turmoil often ensues. Government finances worsen and embarrassed authorities may appeal for external help from international organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bank, or other entities. The economic setbacks

Currency Crashes The chart shows that exchange rate crises are common events.

Note: An exchange rate crisis is defined here as an event in which a currency loses more than  $30\%$  of its value in U.S. dollar terms over one year, having changed by less than  $20\%$  each of the previous two years. There were currency crises according to this definition in 2001 also in Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia, but these countries are pegged (the latter) to or in a monetary union with South Africa, and only this one crisis is shown.

are often more pronounced in poorer countries. Although we could confine our study of exchange rates to normal times, the frequent and damaging occurrence of crises obliges us to pay attention to these abnormal episodes, too.

Key Topics Why do exchange rate crises occur? Are they an inevitable consequence of deeper fundamental problems in an economy or are they an avoidable result of "animal spirits"—irrational forces in financial markets? Why are these crises so economically and politically costly? What steps might be taken to prevent crises, and at what cost?

# Summary and Plan of Study

International macroeconomists frequently refer to the exchange rate as "the single most important price in an open economy." If we treat this statement as more than self-promotion, we should learn why it might be true. In our course of study, we will explore the factors that determine the exchange rate, how the exchange rate affects the economy, and how crises occur.

Our study of exchange rates proceeds as follows: in Chapter 13, we learn about the structure and operation of the markets in which foreign currencies are traded.

# HEADLINES

# Economic Crisis in Iceland

International macroeconomics can often seem like a dry and abstract subject, but it must be remembered that societies and individuals can be profoundly shaken by the issues we will study. This article was written just after the start of the severe economic crisis that engulfed Iceland in 2008, following the collapse of its exchange rate, a financial crisis, and a government fiscal crisis. Real output per person shrank by more than  $10\%$ , and unemployment rose from  $1\%$  to  $9\%$ . Five years later a recovery was just beginning to take shape.

Reykjavik—The crisis that brought down Iceland's economy in late 2008 threw thousands of formerly well-off families into poverty, forcing people like Iris to turn to charity to survive.

Each week, up to 550 families queue up at a small white brick warehouse in Reykjavik to receive free food from the Icelandic Aid to Families organisation, three times more than before the crisis.

Rutur Jonsson, a 65-year-old retired mechanical engineer, and his fellow volunteers spend their days distributing milk, bread, eggs and canned food donated by businesses and individuals or bought in bulk at the supermarket.

"I have time to spend on others and that's the best thing I think I can do," he said as he pre-packed grocery bags full of produce.

In a small, close-knit country of just 317,000 people, where everyone knows everyone, the stigma of accepting a hand-out is hard to live down and of the dozens of people waiting outside the food bank in the snow on a dreary March afternoon, Iris is the only one willing to talk.

"It was very difficult for me to come here in the beginning. But now I try not to care so much anymore," said the weary-looking 41-year-old, who lost her job in a pharmacy last summer, as she wrung her hands nervously.

The contrast is brutal with the ostentatious wealth that was on display across the island just two years ago, as a hyperactive banking sector flooded the small, formerly fishing-based economy with fast cash.

Back then, the biggest worry for many Icelanders was who had the nicest SUV, or the most opulent flat.

But today visible signs of poverty are quickly multiplying in the Nordic island nation, despite its generous welfare state, as the middle class is increasingly hit by unemployment, which is up from one to nine per cent in about a year, and a large number of defaults on mortgages.

Icelanders who lose their job are initially entitled to benefits worth 70 per cent of their wages—but the amount dwindles fast the longer they are without work. Coupled with growing debt, the spike in long-term unemployment is taking a heavy toll.

"The 550 families we welcome here represent about 2,700 people, and the number keeps going up. And we think it will keep growing until next year, at least," said Asgerdur Jona Flosadottir, who manages the Reykjavik food bank.

For Iris, the fall came quickly.

She is struggling to keep up with payments on two car loans, which she took out in foreign currencies on what proved to be disastrous advice from her bank, and which have tripled since the kronur's collapse.

Threatened in November with eviction from her home in the village of Vogar, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Reykjavik, she managed to negotiate a year's respite with her bank.

"I feel very bad and I am very worried," she said, running her fingers

Protesters outside the Icelandic parliament in Reykjavik demand that the government do more to improve conditions for the recently poor.

through her long, brown hair.

"I've thought about going abroad, but decided to stay because friends have come forward to guarantee my loans," she added sadly, before leaving with a friend who was driving her back home.

To avoid resorting to charity, many other Icelanders are choosing to pack their bags and try for a new future abroad, with official statistics showing the country's biggest emigration wave in more than a century is underway.

"I just don't see any future here. There isn't going to be any future in this country for the next 20 years," laments Anna Margret Bjoernsdottir, a 46-year-old single mother who is preparing to move to Norway in June if she is unable to ward off eviction from her home near Reykjavik.

For those left behind, a growing number are having trouble scraping together enough money to put decent food on their children's plates.

While only a minority have been forced to seek out food banks to feed their families, some parents admit to going hungry to feed their children.

"I must admit that with the hike in food prices, my two sons eat most of what my husband and I bring home," Arna Borgthorsdottir Cors confessed in a Reykjavik cafe.

"We get what is left over," she says.

Chapters 14 and 15 present the theory of exchange rates. Chapter 16 discusses how exchange rates affect international transactions in assets. We examine the short-run impact of exchange rates on the demand for goods in Chapter 18, and with this understanding Chapter 19 examines the trade-offs governments face as they choose between fixed and floating exchange rates. Chapter 20 covers exchange rate crises in detail and Chapter 21 covers the euro, a common currency used in many countries. Chapter 22 presents further exploration of some exchange rate topics.

# 2 Globalization of Finance: Debts and Deficits

Financial development is a defining characteristic of modern economies. Households' use of financial instruments such as credit cards, savings accounts, and mortgages is taken for granted, as is the ability of firms and governments to use the products and services offered in financial markets. A few years ago, very little of this financial activity spilled across international borders; countries were very nearly closed from a financial standpoint. Today many countries are more open: financial globalization has taken hold around the world, starting in the economically advanced countries and spreading to many emerging market countries.

Although you might expect that you need many complex and difficult theories to understand the financial transactions between countries, such analysis requires only the application of familiar household accounting concepts such as income, expenditure, and wealth. We develop these concepts at the national level to understand how flows of goods, services, income, and capital make the global macroeconomy work. We can then see how the smooth functioning of international finance can make countries better off by allowing them to lend and borrow. Along the way, we also find that financial interactions are not always so smooth. Defaults and other disruptions in financial markets can mean that the potential gains from globalization are not so easily realized in practice.

# Deficits and Surpluses: The Balance of Payments

Do you keep track of your finances? If so, you probably follow two important figures: your income and your expenditure. The difference between the two is an important number: if it is positive, you have a surplus; if it is negative, you have a deficit. The number tells you if you are living within or beyond your means. What would you do with a surplus? The extra money could be added to savings or used to pay down debt. How would you handle a deficit? You could run down your savings or borrow and go into deeper debt. Thus, imbalances between income and expenditure require you to engage in financial transactions with the world outside your household.

At the national level, we can make the same kinds of economic measurements of income, expenditure, deficit, and surplus, and these important indicators of economic performance are the subject of heated policy debate. For example, Table 12-1 shows measures of U.S. national income and expenditure since 1991 in billions of U.S. dollars. At the national level, the income measure is called gross national disposable income; the expenditure measure is called gross national expenditure. The difference between the two is a key macroeconomic aggregate called the current account.

Since posting a small surplus in 1991, the U.S. deficit on the current account (a negative number) has grown much larger and at times it has approached 1 trillion per year, although it fell markedly in the latest recession. That is, U.S. income has not been high

How did the United States bridge this deficit? It engaged in financial transactions with the outside world and borrowed the difference, just as households do.

Because the world as a whole is a closed economy (we can't borrow from outer space, as yet), it is impossible for the world to run a deficit. If the United States is a net borrower, running a current account deficit with income less than expenditure, then the rest of the world must be a net lender to the United States, running surpluses with expenditure less than income. Globally, the world's finances must balance in this way, even if individual countries and regions have surpluses or deficits. Figure 12-3

shows the massive scale of some of these recent imbalances, dramatically illustrating the impact of financial globalization.

Key Topics How do different international economic transactions contribute to current account imbalances? How are these imbalances financed? How long can they persist? Why are some countries in surplus and others in deficit? What role do current account imbalances perform in a well-functioning economy? Why are these imbalances the focus of so much policy debate?

# Debtors and Creditors: External Wealth

To understand the role of wealth in international financial transactions, we revisit our household analogy. Your total wealth or net worth is equal to your assets (what others owe you) minus your liabilities (what you owe others). When you run a surplus, and save money (buying assets or paying down debt), your total wealth, or net worth, tends to rise. Similarly, when you have a deficit and borrow (taking on debt or running down savings), your wealth tends to fall. We can use this analysis to understand the behavior of nations. From an international perspective, a country's net worth is called its external wealth and it equals the difference between its foreign assets (what it is owed by the rest of the world) and its foreign liabilities (what it owes to the rest of the world). Positive external wealth makes a country a creditor nation (other nations owe it money); negative external wealth makes it a debtor nation (it owes other nations money).

Changes in a nation's external wealth can result from imbalances in its current account: external wealth rises when a nation has a surplus, and falls when it has a deficit, all else equal. For example, a string of U.S. current account deficits, going back to the 1980s, has been a major factor in the steady decline in U.S. external wealth, as shown in Figure 12-4, panel (a). The United States was generally a creditor nation until the mid-1980s when it became a debtor nation. More recently, by the end of 2012, the United States was the world's largest debtor, with external wealth equal to  $-\$ 4,416$  billion.[5] Argentina, another country with persistent current account deficits in the 1990s, also saw its external wealth decline, as panel (b) shows.

A closer look at these figures shows that there must be other factors that affect external wealth besides expenditure and income. For example, in years in which the United States ran deficits, its external wealth sometimes went up, not down. How can this be? Let us return to the household analogy. If you have ever invested in the stock market, you may know that even in a year when your expenditure exceeds your income, you may still end up wealthier because the value of your stocks has risen. For example, if you run a deficit of  \$1,000, but the value of your stocks rises by\$ 10,000, then, on net, you are \$9,000 wealthier. If the stocks' value falls by \$10,000, your wealth will fall by 11,000. Again, what is true for households is true for countries: their external wealth can be affected by capital gains (or, if negative, capital losses) on investments, so we need to think carefully about the complex causes and consequences of external wealth.

We also have to remember that a country can gain not only by having the value of its assets rise but also by having the value of its liabilities fall. Sometimes, liabilities fall because of market fluctuations; at other times they fall as a result of a deliberate action such as a nation deciding to default on its debts. For example, in 2002 Argentina

External Wealth A country's net credit position with the rest of the world is called external wealth. The time series charts show levels of external wealth from 1980 to 2007 for the United States in panel (a) and Argentina in panel (b). All else equal, deficits cause external wealth to fall; surpluses (and defaults) cause it to rise.

Source: Philip R. Lane and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, 2007, "The External Wealth of Nations Mark II: Revised and Extended Estimates of Foreign Assets and Liabilities, 1970-2004," Journal of International Economics, 73(2), 223-250 (and updates).

announced a record default on its government debt by offering to pay about  $30\text{e}$  for each dollar of debt in private hands. The foreigners who held most of this debt lost about  $\$ 55$  billion. At the same time, Argentina gained about  $\$ 55$  billion in external wealth, as shown by the sudden jump in Figure 12-4, panel (b). Thus, you don't have to run a surplus to increase external wealth—external wealth rises not only when creditors are paid off but also when they are blown off.

Key Topics What forms can a nation's external wealth take and does the composition of wealth matter? What explains the level of a nation's external wealth and how does it change over time? How important is the current account as a determinant of external wealth? How does it relate to the country's present and future economic welfare?

# Darlings and Deadbeats: Defaults and Other Risks

The 2002 Argentine government's debt default was by no means unusual. The following countries (among many others) have defaulted (sometimes more than once) on private creditors since 1980: Argentina (twice), Chile, Dominican Republic (twice), Ecuador, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru (twice), Philippines, Russia (twice), South Africa (twice), Ukraine, and Uruguay (twice). Dozens more countries could be added to the list if we expanded the definition of default to include the inability to make payments on loans from international financial institutions like the World Bank. (These debts may be continually rolled over, thus avoiding default by a technicality. In some cases, such loans are eventually forgiven, so they do not fall into the "default" category.)

Defaults highlight a peculiar risk of international finance: creditors may be poorly protected in foreign jurisdictions. Sovereign governments can repudiate debt without legal penalty or hurt creditors in other ways such as by taking away their assets or changing laws or regulations after investments have already been made.

International investors try to avoid these risks as much as possible by careful assessment and monitoring of debtors. For example, any financial misbehavior by a nation or firm usually ends up on a credit report: a "grade A" credit score means easy access to low-interest loans; a "grade C" score means more limited credit and very high interest rates. Advanced countries usually have good credit ratings, but emerging markets often find themselves subject to lower ratings.

In one important type of credit rating, countries are also rated on the quality of the bonds they issue to raise funds. Such bonds are rated by agencies such as Standard & Poor's (S&P): bonds rated BBBor higher are considered high-grade or investment-grade bonds and bonds rated BB+ and lower are called junk bonds. Poorer ratings tend to go hand in hand with higher interest rates. The difference between the interest paid on a safe "benchmark" U.S. Treasury bond and the interest paid on a bond issued by a nation associated with greater risk is called country risk. Thus, if U.S. bonds pay  $3\%$  and another country pays  $5\%$  per annum on its bonds, the country risk is  $+2\%$ .

For example, on September 28, 2012, the Financial Times reported that relatively good investment-grade governments such as Poland (grade A-) and Brazil (BBB) carried a country risk of  $+1.15\%$  and  $+0.67\%$  respectively, relative to U.S. Treasuries. Governments with junk grades such as Indonesia (grade BB+) and Turkey (BB) had to pay higher interest rates, with a country risk of  $1.66\%$  and  $2.69\%$ , respectively. Finally, Argentina, a country still technically in default, had bonds trading so cheaply (unrated, and considered beyond junk) they carried a massive  $+58\%$  of country risk.

Key Topics Why do countries default? And what happens when they do? What are the determinants of risk premiums? How do risk premiums affect macroeconomic outcomes such as output, wealth, and exchange rates?

# Summary and Plan of Study

International flows of goods, services, income, and capital allow the global macroeconomy to operate. In our course of study, we build up our understanding gradually, starting with basic accounting and measurement, then moving on to the causes and consequences of imbalances in the flows and the accumulations of debts and credits. Along the way, we learn about the gains from financial globalization, as well as some of its potential risks.

In Chapter 16, we learn how international transactions enter into a country's national income accounts. Chapter 17 considers the helpful functions that imbalances can play in a well-functioning economy in the long run, and shows us the potential long-run benefits of financial globalization. Chapter 18 then explores how imbalances play a role in short-run macroeconomic adjustment and in the workings of the monetary and fiscal policies that are used to manage a nation's aggregate demand. In Chapter 19, we learn that assets traded internationally are often denominated in different currencies and see how wealth can be sensitive to exchange rate changes and what macroeconomic effects this might have. Chapter 20 examines the implications of risk premiums for exchange rates, and shows that exchange rate crises and default crises are linked. Chapter 22 explores in more detail topics such as global imbalances and default.

# 3 Government and Institutions: Policies and Performance

In theory, one could devise a course of study in international economics without reference to government, but the result might not shed much light on reality. As we know from other courses in economics, and as we have already started to see in this chapter, government actions influence economic outcomes in many ways by making decisions about exchange rates, macroeconomic policies, whether to pay (or not pay) their debts, and so on.

To gain a deeper understanding of the global macroeconomy, we can look at government activity on several distinct levels. We will study policies, direct government actions, including familiar textbook topics like monetary and fiscal policy. However, economists also consider the broader context of rules and norms, or the regimes in which policy choices are made. At the broadest level, research also focuses on institutions, a term that refers to the overall legal, political, cultural, and social structures that influence economic and political actions.

To conclude this brief introduction to international macroeconomics, we highlight three important features of the broad macroeconomic environment that play an important role in the remainder of this book: the rules that a government decides to apply to restrict or allow capital mobility; the decision that a government makes between a fixed and a floating exchange rate regime; and the institutional foundations of economic performance, such as the quality of governance that prevails in a country.

# Integration and Capital Controls: The Regulation of International Finance

The United States is seen as one of the most financially open countries in the world, fully integrated into the global capital market. This is mostly true, but in recent years the U.S. government has blocked some foreign investment in ports, oil, and airlines. These are exceptional cases in the United States, but in many countries there are numerous, severe restrictions on cross-border financial transactions.

It is important to remember that globalization does not occur in a political vacuum. Globalization is often viewed as a technological phenomenon, a process driven by innovations in transport and communications such as container shipping and the Internet. But international economic integration has also occurred because some governments have allowed it to happen. In the past 60 years, international trade has grown as trade barriers have been slowly dismantled. More recently, many nations have encouraged international capital movement by lifting restrictions on financial transactions.

Figure 12-5 documents some of the important features of the trend toward financial globalization since 1970. Panel (a) employs an index of financial openness, where  $0\%$  means fully closed with tight capital controls and  $100\%$  means fully open with no controls. The index is compiled from measures of restriction on cross-border financial transactions. The average value of the index is shown for three groups of countries that will play an important role in our analysis:

(b) Increase in Financial Transactions

Foreign assets and liabilities (\% of GDP)

Financial Globalization Since the 1970s, many restrictions on international financial transactions have been lifted, as shown by the time series chart in panel (a). The volume of transactions has also increased dramatically, as shown in panel (b). These trends have been strongest in the advanced countries, followed by the emerging markets and the developing countries.

Lane and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, 2007, "The External Wealth of Nations Mark II: Revised and Extended Estimates of Foreign Assets and Liabilities, 1970-2004," Journal of International Economics 73(2), 223-250 (and updates); Menzie D.

Rogoff, and Shang-Jin Wei, 2006, "Financial Globalization: A Reappraisal," NBER Working Paper No. 12484.

Advanced countries—countries with high levels of income per person that are well integrated into the global economy

Emerging markets—middle-income countries that are growing and becoming more integrated into the global economy

Developing countries—low-income countries that are not yet well integrated into the global economy

Using these data to gauge policy changes over the past three decades, we can see that the trend toward financial openness started first, and went the furthest, in the advanced countries, with a rapid shift toward openness evident in the 1980s, when many countries abolished capital controls that had been in place since World War II. We can also see that in the 1990s, emerging markets also started to become more financially open and, to a lesser degree, so did some developing countries.

What were the consequences of these policy changes? Panel (b) shows that as the world became more financially open, the extent of cross-border financial transactions

(total foreign assets and liabilities expressed as a fraction of output) increased by a factor of 10 or more. As one might expect, this trend has gone the furthest in the more financially open advanced countries, but the emerging markets and developing countries follow a similar path.

Key Topics Why have so many countries made the choice to pursue policies of financial openness? What are the potential economic benefits of removing capital

controls and encouraging openness? If there are benefits, why has this policy change been so slow to occur since the 1970s? Are there any costs that offset the benefits? If so, can capital controls benefit the country that imposes them?

# Independence and Monetary Policy: The Choice of Exchange Rate Regimes

There are two broad categories of exchange rate behavior: fixed regimes and floating regimes. How common is each type? Figure 12-6 shows that there are many countries operating under each kind of regime. Because fixed and floating are both common regime choices, we have to understand both.

The choice of exchange rate regime is a major policy problem. If you have noticed the attention given by journalists and policy makers in recent years to the exchange rate movements of the dollar, euro, yen, pound, yuan, and other currencies, you know that these are important issues in debates on the global economy.

Exploring the evidence on exchange rate fluctuations, their origins, and their impact is a major goal of this book. On an intuitive level, whether we are confused travelers fumbling to change money at the bank or importers and exporters trying to conduct business in a predictable way, we have a sense that exchange rate fluctuations, especially if drastic, can impose real economic costs. If every country fixed its exchange rate, we could avoid those costs. Or, taking the argument to an extreme, if we had a single world currency, we might think that all currency-related transaction costs could be avoided. With more than 150 different currencies in existence today, however, we are very far from such a monetary utopia!

The existence of multiple currencies in the world dates back centuries, and for a country to possess its own currency has long been viewed as an almost essential aspect of sovereignty. Without control of its own national currency, a government's freedom to pursue its own monetary policy is sacrificed automatically. However, it still remains to be seen how beneficial monetary independence is.

Despite the profusion of currencies, we also see newly emerging forms of monetary organization. Some groups of countries have sought to simplify their transactions through the adoption of a common currency with shared policy responsibility. The

most notable example is the Eurozone, a subset of the European Union that in 2013 comprised 17 countries, but with more members expected to join at some point in the future. Still other countries have chosen to use currencies over which they have no policy control, as with the recent cases of dollarization in El Salvador and Ecuador.

Key Topics Why do so many countries insist on the "barbarism" of having their own currency (as John Stuart Mill put it)? Why do some countries create a common currency or adopt another nation's currency as their own? Why do some of the countries that have kept their own currencies maintain a fixed exchange rate with another currency? And why do others permit their exchange rate to fluctuate over time, making a floating exchange rate their regime choice?

# Institutions and Economic Performance: The Quality of Governance

Going beyond specific policy choices, economists also consider the broader institutional context in which such choices are made. The legal, political, social, cultural, ethical, and religious structures of a society can influence the environment for economic prosperity and stability, or poverty and instability.

Figure 12-7 shows evidence on the importance of the quality of a nation's institutions or "governance" using an average or composite of measures on six dimensions: voice and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. The figure shows that, across countries, institutional quality is strongly correlated with economic outcomes (see Headlines: The Wealth of Nations).

First, we see that better institutions are correlated with more income per capita in panel (a). A government that is unaccountable, unstable, ineffective, unpredictable, corrupt, and not based on laws is unlikely to encourage commerce, business, investment, or innovation. The effects of institutions on economic prosperity are very large. In the advanced countries at the top right of the figure, income per person is more than 50 times larger than in the poorest developing countries at the bottom left, probably the largest gap between rich and poor nations we have ever seen in history. Economists refer to this unequal outcome as "The Great Divergence."

We also see that better institutions are correlated with less income volatility (i.e., smaller fluctuations in the growth of income per capita, measured by the standard deviation). This result is shown in panel (b) and may also reflect the unpredictability of economic activity in poorly governed economies. There may be periodic shifts in political power, leading to big changes in economic policies. Or there may be internal conflict between groups that sporadically breaks out and leads to conflict over valuable economic resources. Or the state may be too weak to ensure that essential policies to stabilize the economy (such as bank regulation) are carried out.

Recent research has documented these patterns and has sought to show that causality runs from institutions to outcomes and to explore the possible sources of institutional variation. Institutional change is typically very slow, taking decades or even centuries, because vested interests may block efficiency-enhancing reforms. Thus, as the institutional economist Thorstein Veblen famously pointed out, "Institutions are products of the past process, are adapted to past circumstances, and are therefore never in full accord with the requirements of the present." Consequently, influential recent research seeks to find the roots of institutional (and income) divergence in factors such as:

Actions of colonizing powers (helpful in setting up good institutions in areas settled by Europeans but harmful in tropical areas where Europeans did not transplant their own institutions, but instead supported colonizers and local elites with a strong interest in extracting revenue or resources);

- Types of legal codes that different countries developed (British common law generally resulted in better outcomes than codes based on continental civil law);
Resource endowments (tropical regions being more suitable for slave-based economies, elite rule, and high inequality; temperate regions being more suited to small-scale farming, decentralized democracy, and better governance).

Key Topics Governance explains large differences in countries' economic outcomes. Poor governance generally means that a country is poorer, subject to more damaging macroeconomic and political shocks, and cannot conduct policy in a reliable and consistent way. These characteristics force us to think carefully about how to formulate optimal policies and policy regimes in rich and poor countries. One size may not fit all, and policies that work well in a stable well-governed country may be less successful in an unstable developing country with poor governance.

# Summary and Plan of Study

The functioning of the global macroeconomy is affected in many ways by the actions of governments. Throughout this book, we must pay attention to the possible actions that governments might take and try to understand their possible causes and consequences.

Chapter 15 explores the finding that if a country is financially open, then a fixed exchange rate is incompatible with monetary policy autonomy. Because both goals may be desirable, policy makers are often reluctant to face up to the difficult trade-offs implied by financial globalization. Chapter 17 explores the economic rationales for financial liberalization: If financial openness has clear economic benefits, why are countries slow to liberalize? We explore exchange rate regime choice in detail in Chapter 19 and study the trade-offs involved. Then, in Chapter 20, we study crises, and find that if a country's policy makers cling to fixed exchange rates, there is a risk of suffering costly crises. The remarkable Euro project, discussed in Chapter 21, throws these issues into sharper perspective in the one region of the world where economic integration has arguably progressed the furthest in recent decades—but where the recent economic crisis has been most severe. The main lessons of our study are that policy makers need to acknowledge trade-offs, formulate sensible goals, and exercise careful judgment when deciding when and how to financially open their economies. Sadly, history shows that, all too often, they don't.

# HEADLINES

# The Wealth of Nations

Social scientists have sought for centuries to understand the essential conditions that enable a nation to achieve prosperity. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith said: "Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice; all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things." The following article discusses the poor quality of governance in developing countries and the obstacle this poses to economic development.

It takes 200 days to register a new business in Haiti and just two in Australia. This contrast perfectly encapsulates the gulf between one of the world's poorest countries and one of the richest. A sophisticated mar ket economy is a uniquely powerful engine of prosperity. Yet, in far too many poor countries, the law's delays and the insolence of office prevent desperately needed improvements in economic performance.

That makes [the 2005] "World Development Report" among the most important the World Bank has ever produced.* It is about how to make market economies work… . The report is based on two big research projects: surveys of the investment climate … in 53 countries; and the "doing business" project, which identifies obstacles to business in 130 countries… . The argument starts with growth. As the report rightly notes: "With rising populations, economic growth is the only sustainable mechanism for increasing a society's standard of living." Happily, "investment climate improvements in China and India have driven the greatest reductions in poverty the world has ever seen." … Governmental failure is the most important obstacle business faces. Inadequate enforcement of contracts, inappropriate regulations, corruption, rampant crime and unreliable infrastructure can cost 25 per cent of sales. This is more than three times what businesses typically pay in taxes. Similarly, when asked to enumerate the obstacles they face, businesses list policy uncertainty, macroeconomic instability, taxes and corruption at the head of the list. What do these have in common? Incompetence and malfeasance by governments is again the answer… .

In many developing countries, the requirement is not less government but more and better directed government. What does this involve? Four requirements are listed: a reduction in the "rent-seeking" that affects all countries but mars developing countries to an extreme extent; credibility in the making and execution of policy; the fostering of public trust and legitimacy; and the tailoring of policy responses to what works in local conditions.

One of the conclusions the report rightly draws from this list is that reform is not a one-off event but a process. What is involved is not just discrete and

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/8ccb084eb6a9af1b71e52966dbfae2b1dafd5c440808f624a71a0a739c85cbbf.jpg)

Green means grow: The map above shows the World Bank's composite Worldwide Governance Indicator in 2005. The index measures voice and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. Green indicates a country that is in the top  $25\%$  based on this measure; yellow, the next  $25\%$ ; orange, the next  $25\%$ ; and red, the bottom  $25\%$ . Dark green and dark red are the top and bottom  $10\%$ , respectively. The prosperity in Europe, North America, Australasia, and Japan coincides with the best institutions of governance; the poverty in so much of Africa and parts of Asia with the poorest ones.

well-known policy changes (such as lower tariffs) but the fine-tuning of policy and the evolution of institutions. This is why, it suggests, the credibility of the government's journey, as in China, may be more important than the details of policy at each stage along the way.

Turning these broad objectives into specific policy is a tricky business. The Bank describes its core recommendation as "delivering the basics." These are: stability and security, which includes protection of property… , facilitating contract enforcement, curbing crime and compensating for expropriation; better regulation and taxation, which means focusing intervention where it is needed, broadening the tax base and lowering tax rates, and reducing barriers to trade; better finance and infrastructure, which requires both more competition and better regulation; and transforming labour market regulation, to foster skills, while avoiding the counterproductive interventions that so often destroy employment in the formal sector… .

The world's wealthy countries can also help by lifting their many barriers to imports from developing countries and by targeting aid on improving the investment climate.

Governments then are both the disease and the cure. This is why development is so hard and so slow. The big advance is in the richness of our understanding of what makes an economy thrive. But that understanding also demonstrates the difficulties. The Bank's recognition of the nature of the disease is at least a first step towards the cure.

# 4 Conclusions

Today's global macroeconomy is an economic system characterized by increasingly integrated markets for goods, services, and capital. To effectively study macroeconomic outcomes in this context, we must understand the economic linkages between different countries—their currencies, their trade, their capital flows, and so on. Only then can we begin to understand some of the most important economic phenomena in the world today, such as the fluctuations in currencies, the causes of crises, the determinants of global imbalances, the problems of economic policy making, and the origins of the growing gap between rich and poor countries.

# KEY POINTS

1. Countries have different currencies, and the price at which these currencies trade is known as the exchange rate. In learning what determines this exchange rate and how the exchange rate is linked to the rest of the economy, we confront various questions: Why do some countries have fixed exchange rates and others floating? Why do some go from one to the other, often in response to a crisis? Why do some countries have no currency of their own?
2. When countries are financially integrated, it allows them to decouple their level of income from their level of expenditure; the difference between the two is the current account. An important goal is to understand what determines the current account and how the current account is linked to the rest of a nation's econ omy. Along the way, we learn how a country's current account affects its wealth, how its credits and debts are settled, and how the current account changes.
3. Countries differ in the quality of their policy choices and in the quality of the deeper institutional context in which policies are made. In studying international macroeconomic interactions and events, it is essential to understand how policy regimes and institutions affect policy choices and economic outcomes. How does quality of governance affect economic outcomes? Why might some policies, such as a fixed exchange rate, work better in some contexts than others? Do country characteristics affect the costs and benefits of financial globalization?

(a) Which country in each pair experienced faster growth in GDP per capita? Which one is now richest?

(b)The World Bank's World Governance Indicators for each country in 2000 were as shown in the table above (higher is better):

Based on these data, do you think institutions can explain the divergent outcomes in these countries? Explain. Why do you think it helps to compare countries that are physically contiguous?
