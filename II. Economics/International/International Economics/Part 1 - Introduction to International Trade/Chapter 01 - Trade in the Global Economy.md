# Trade in the Global Economy

The emergence of China, India, and the former communist-bloc countries implies that the greater part of the earth's population is now engaged, at least potentially, in the global economy. There are no historical antecedents for this development.

Ben Bernanke, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, 2006

The main losers in today's very unequal world are not those who are too much exposed to globalization. They are those who have been left out.

Kofi Annan, former secretary general of the United Nations, 2000

In August 2009, the ships Beluga Fraternity and Beluga Foresight made a historic voyage through the Northern Sea Route of the Arctic Ocean, accompanied by a Russian nuclear icebreaker. These ships carried power-plant components from South Korea, around the top of Russia, to the Siberian port of Novy, where the cargo was unloaded. The ships continued westward to the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This was one of the first times that commercial ships had successfully navigated this northern route through the Arctic Circle, and it was made possible by the shrinkage of Arctic ice in recent years. It is believed that global warming is causing the Arctic ice to melt, which will open up new shipping lanes through the Arctic Ocean.

In this historical milestone, we see that global climate change can have important consequences for international trade, by which we mean the movement of goods (such as cargo) and services (such as the shipping of the cargo) across borders. To move goods from South Korea (or elsewhere in Asia) to Europe would normally involve a trip through the Suez Canal (in the Middle East) at much greater cost. The Northern Sea Route is shorter than the Suez Canal route by about 4,000 nautical miles. If the Northern Sea Route becomes passable for much of the year, then we would expect that the amount of trade from Asia to Europe will increase.

In this book, we will study international trade in goods and services and will learn the economic forces that determine what that trade looks like: what products are traded; who trades them; at what quantities and prices they are traded; and what the

benefits and costs of trade are. We will also learn about the policies that governments use to shape trade patterns among countries.

Why should we care about international trade? Many people believe that international trade creates opportunities for countries to grow and thrive. The manufacture of goods exported from China, for example, creates employment for many millions of workers there. The same is true for exports from the United States and European countries. It is not just large countries that potentially benefit from trade; smaller countries, too, are affected. In Greenland, for example, higher temperatures due to global warming have exposed deposits of "rare earth" minerals, such as lanthanum and neodymium, which are used in cell phones and other high-tech devices. Because of international trade, Greenland is expected to benefit from exporting these rare earth minerals to meet global demand. But such benefits can also bring difficult social change and challenges, as the traditional lifestyle of fishing becomes less crucial to Greenland's economy. In this book we will explore both the opportunities and challenges created by international trade for different groups in society.

Let's begin by looking at a very broad picture of international trade. What country was the world's largest exporter of goods in 2012? If you guessed China, you are right: since 2009, it overtook Germany as the top exporter. In 2012, China sold around  \$ 2.0 trillion in goods to other countries, ahead of the \$ 1.6 trillion exported by the second-place country, the United States. The third largest exporter of goods was Germany, which exported \$ 1.5 trillion in goods.

These numbers reveal only part of the trade picture, however, because in addition to exporting goods, countries also export services. In 2012 the United States exported  \$ 0.6 trillion in services (including business services, education of foreign students, travel by foreigners, and so forth). If we combine exports in goods and services, then in 2012 the world's largest exporter was the United States at \$ 2.2 trillion, followed by China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan.

Nations trade goods for many reasons, the most obvious of which is that they can get products from abroad that are cheaper or of higher quality than those they can produce at home. For example, Germany was the largest exporter of goods up until 2009, a position that reflected its world-class technologies for producing high-quality manufactured goods, such as cars like the BMW and Mercedes-Benz. China, on the other hand, can produce goods more cheaply than most industrial countries. The United States has both the technology to produce high-quality manufactured goods and the ability to produce agricultural goods very cheaply (because of its abundant land resources as well as government policies).

In the first part of this book, we develop a number of models that help us understand the reasons that countries trade goods and services. In addition, we investigate migration, the flow of people across borders as they move from one country to another, and foreign direct investment (FDI), the flow of capital across borders when a firm owns a company in another country. All three types of flows between countries—of products (goods and services), people, and capital—are so common today that we take them for granted. When you go into a store to purchase an item, for example, it is possible that it was made in another country, the store itself might be foreign-owned, and the salesperson who assists you may be an immigrant. Why are these international flows so common? What are the consequences of these flows for the countries involved? And what actions do governments take to make their countries more or less open to trade, migration, and FDI? These are the questions we address.

# 1 International Trade

This section begins our study of international economics by defining some important terms and summarizing the overall trends in world trade.

# The Basics of World Trade

Countries buy and sell goods and services from one another constantly. An export is a product sold from one country to another, and an import is a product bought by one country from another. We normally think of exports and imports as goods that are shipped between countries, but for services that is not necessarily the case. Construction services, for example, are performed on-site in the importing country rather than being shipped. Travel and tourism are large categories of service exports that also occur on-site: the money spent by a U.S. visitor to the Eiffel Tower is a service export of France, and a Chinese visitor to the Grand Canyon adds to U.S. service exports.

A country's trade balance is the difference between its total value of exports and its total value of imports (usually including both goods and services). Countries that export more than they import, such as China in recent years, run a trade surplus,

whereas countries that import more than they export, such as the United States, run a trade deficit. In addition to keeping track of the overall trade balance for a country with the rest of the world, we often see reported in the newspaper the bilateral trade balance, meaning the difference between exports and imports between two countries. The U.S. bilateral trade balance with China, for example, has been a trade deficit of more than \$ 200 billion every year between 2005 and 2012.

In the models developed to understand international trade, we are not concerned with whether a country has a trade deficit or surplus but just assume that each country has balanced trade, with exports equal to imports. There are two reasons why we make this assumption. First, economists believe that an overall trade deficit or surplus arises from macroeconomic conditions, such as the overall levels of spending and savings in an economy—countries with high spending and low savings will run a trade deficit. (Macroeconomic conditions are studied in the second half of this book that deals with international macroeconomics.)

Second, the interpretation of a trade deficit or surplus is problematic when we focus on the bilateral trade balance between two countries, such as the United States and China. To see what the problem is, think about the U.S. import of a particular good from China, such as the iPhone (see Headlines: Sum of iPhone Parts: Trade Distortion).

In 2010, the iPhone 3GS was valued at about  \$ 179 when it was shipped from China to the United States, and it sold for about \$ 500 in the United States. However only \$ 6.50 of that amount reflects the value of Chinese labor used in the assembly. The rest of the \$ 172.50 export value was actually imported into China from other countries, including: \$ 60 for the flash memory, display module, and touch screen from Toshiba in Japan; \$ 23 for the processor chip and memory from Samsung in Korea; \$ 29 for the camera and transmitting and receiving devices from Infineon in Germany, and so on. Nevertheless, the entire \$ 179 is counted as an export from China to the United States. This example shows that the bilateral trade deficit or surplus between countries is a slippery concept. It doesn't really make sense to count the entire \$ 179 iPhone as a Chinese export to the United States, as is done in official trade statistics, when only \$ 6.50 is the value-added in China; that is, the difference between the value of the iPhone when it leaves China and the cost of parts and materials purchased in China and imported from other countries. That shortcoming of official statistics gives us a good reason to not focus on the bilateral trade deficit or surplus between countries, even though that number is often reported in the media.

The iPhone example illustrates how the manufacturing required for a single final product is often spread across many countries. That so many countries can be involved in manufacturing a final product and its components is a new phenomenon that illustrates the drop in transportation and communication costs in the modern world economy. In the past, trade occurred in more standardized goods (such as raw materials) that were shipped long distances, but were not shipped back-and-forth between countries during the manufacturing process. This new feature of world trade and production, often called offshoring, is discussed later in the book; here, we present the idea by looking at how trade patterns have changed over time.

# Sum of Iphone Parts: Trade Distortion

Although the iPhone sold in the United States is assembled in China, most of its value comes from parts made in other countries. Counting its full value as a U.S. import from China therefore exaggerates the size of the U.S. trade deficit with China.

One widely touted solution for current U.S. economic woes is for America to come up with more of the high-tech gadgets that the rest of the world craves. Yet two academic researchers have found that Apple Inc.'s iPhone—one of the most iconic U.S. technology products—actually added \$ 19 billion to the U.S. trade deficit with China last year. How is this possible?

... Though the iPhone is entirely designed and owned by a U.S. company, and is made largely of parts produced in other countries, it is physically assembled in China. Both countries' trade statistics therefore consider the iPhone a Chinese export to the U.S. So a U.S. consumer who buys what is often considered an American product will add to the U.S. trade deficit with China. The result is that according to official statistics, "even high-tech products invented by U.S. companies will not increase U.S. exports," . . . This isn't a problem with high-tech products, but with how exports and imports are measured . .

The new research adds to a growing technical debate about traditional

trade statistics that could have big real-world consequences. Conventional trade figures are the basis for political battles waging in Washington and Brussels over what to do about China's currency policies and its allegedly unfair trading practices. But there is a growing belief that the practice of assuming every product shipped from one country is entirely produced by that country may need to be adjusted. "What we call 'Made in China' is indeed assembled in China, but what makes up the commercial value of the product comes from the numerous countries that preceded its assembly in China in the global value chain," Pascal Lamy, the director-general of the World Trade Organization, said in a speech in October. "The concept of country of origin for manufactured goods has gradually become obsolete." Mr. Lamy said that if trade statistics were adjusted to reflect the actual value contributed to a product by different countries, the size of the U.S. trade deficit with China— \$ 226.88 billion, according to U.S. figures—would be cut in half. That

Products like the Apple iPhone are often assembled in China from components made in many other countries.

means, he argued, that political tensions over trade deficits are probably larger than they should be.

# Is Trade Today Different from the Past?

Is the type of trade today different from that in the past? The answer to this question is yes. Not only is there more international trade today than in the past, but the type of trade has also changed. We can see the changes in the type of trade by organizing imports and exports into four categories, depending on their use in the economy: (1) foods, feeds, and beverages; (2) industrial supplies and materials (raw materials

like chemicals and petroleum and basic processed goods, such as steel, newsprint, and textiles); (3) capital goods (durable goods including aircraft, cars, computers, machinery, and so forth); (4) finished consumer goods (all finished household goods, except cars and computers, but including the iPhone). The percentage of U.S. imports and exports accounted for by these four categories from 1925 to 2010 is shown in Figure 1-1, with U.S. imports in panel (a) and exports in panel (b).

In Figure 1-1(a), we see that U.S. trade has shifted away from agriculture and raw materials and toward manufactured goods, as shown by the declining shares of foods, feeds, and beverages and industrial supplies and materials. Together, these two categories of traded goods accounted for  $ 90\% $ of imports in 1925 but only about $ 40\% $

(b) Exports

The Changing Face of U.S. Import and Export Industries, 1925-2010 The types of goods imported and exported by the United States have changed drastically over the past century. Foods, feeds, and beverages and industrial supplies were  $ 90\% $ of imports in 1925, but represented only $ 40\% $  in 2010. These categories' shares

of exports have also fallen from  $ 80\% $ in 1925 to $ 40\% $ in 2010. Capital plus consumer goods plus automobiles have increased from $ 10\% $ of imports in 1925 to $ 60\% $ of imports in 2010. Exports of these goods have likewise increased from $ 20\% $ in 1925 to $ 60\% $  in 2010.

in 2010. Figure 1-1(b) shows that the export share of these same categories also fell from about  $ 80\% $ to $ 40\% $  over that time.

Figure 1-1(a) also shows that the imports of capital goods plus consumer goods have increased from  $ 10\% $ in 1925 to $ 60\% $ in 2010. In Figure 1-1(b), we see that the export of capital plus consumer goods has likewise increased from about $ 20\% $ of exports in 1925 to about $ 60\% $  of exports in 2010. Capital goods and consumer products (including the iPhone) are the types of goods that are most likely to have a portion of their production process sent overseas through offshoring. The fact that the share of trade in these products has increased shows that the type of trade today has changed greatly from the past.

# Map of World Trade

To show the flow of exports and imports around the world, we use the map in Figure 1-2, which shows trade in billions of dollars for 2010. That year about \$ 16.8 trillion in goods crossed international borders. (Because trade in services is harder to measure between countries, we do not include it in Figure 1-2.) The amount

of trade in goods is illustrated by the width of the lines, with the largest trade flows having the heaviest lines and the smallest having dashed lines. For large trade flows, we usually draw two lines indicating the direction of each trade flow. For smaller amounts of trade, we draw a single dashed line, with the amount of the trade flows shown on each arrow. The trade flows within certain regions, such as Europe, are described by a circle, with the total amount of trade shown.

European and U.S. Trade The largest amount of trade shown in Figure 1-2 is the flow of goods within Europe, which was \(3.9 trillion in 2010, or almost one-quarter (23%) of world trade! This fact is shown in Table 1-1 as internal trade within Europe. The European countries trade a great deal with one another because there are so many countries located there and because it is easy to ship from one country to another. Furthermore, trade is high because import tariffs (taxes on international trade) are low. The European Union is a group of countries within Europe that have zero tariffs on imports from one another. That group of countries expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004, with two more countries joining in 2007, so most of the European countries trade with each other at zero tariffs.[2]

In addition to large trade flows among the European countries, there are also large trade flows between the United States and Europe. The United States exported  \$ 303 billion of goods to Europe in 2010 and imported \$ 377 billion of goods from Europe. If we add those flows to the trade flow within Europe, we find that Europe and the United States account for about \$ 4.6 trillion, or 27%, of the \$ 16.8 trillion in world trade flows. This fact is also recorded in Table 1-1, and it shows that a large amount

of world trade occurs between countries that are similar in their levels of advanced industrialization and great wealth. Why do these countries trade so much with one another?

The many differences among European countries and between Europe and the United States explain, in part, the trade between them. The first model of trade we study in the next chapter, called the Ricardian model, was initially used to explain trade between England and Portugal based on their difference in climate. Despite such differences, however, industrialized countries like the United Kingdom and the United States have many similarities in their consumption patterns and in their ability to produce goods and services. Why, then, do "similar" countries trade so much with one another? We try to answer that question in a later chapter, by arguing that even similar countries have enough variety in the goods they produce (such as different models of cars or types of cheese) that it is natural for them to trade with one another.

Trade in the Americas There is also a large amount of trade recorded within the Americas; that is, between North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. In 2010 the United States exported  \$ 248 billion to Canada and imported \$ 289 billion from Canada. In addition, the United States exported \$ 303 billion to Latin America (which consists of Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean) and imported \$ 378 billion from Latin America. If we add together these trade flows, plus the amounts that Canada trades with Latin America and Latin America trades internally, we get \$ 1.4 trillion as the total trade in goods within the Americas in 2010, or another 8% of world trade.

So trade within the Americas is about one-third of trade within Europe, and the vast majority of that trade is within the North American Free Trade Area, consisting of Canada, the United States, and Mexico. There is a proposal to extend free trade with the United States to many of the other countries that border the Pacific Ocean in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. There is also a proposal for a free trade area between the United States and the European Union in the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. We study the consequences of free trade areas for the countries included, and for the countries left out, in a later chapter.

If we add the trade flows within the Americas to those within Europe and also include all other exports of these two regions to the rest of the world, we find that these combined regions account for  \$ 8.5 trillion in exports, or about one-half (51%) of the \$ 16.8 trillion in world trade. This finding is also recorded in Table 1-1.

Trade with Asia Very large trade flows are also shown in Figure 1-2 to and from Asia. For example, Europe exported  \$ 575 billion to the Asian countries in 2010 and imported \$ 947 billion. The United States exported \$ 69 billion to Japan and \$ 301 billion to the rest of Asia and imported about twice as much from each of these regions.

If we break up Asian exports to the United States, the largest exporting country is China (selling  \$ 383 billion in 2010), followed by Japan (\$ 124 billion), South Korea (\$ 51 billion), and Taiwan (\$ 37 billion). India, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the other Asian countries export smaller amounts. The exports from all of Asia to the United States totaled \$ 792 billion in 2010.

All the exports from Asia totaled about \(5.7 trillion in 2010, or about one-third \((34\%)\) of world trade, as shown in Table 1-1. Remember that this total includes only trade in goods and omits trade in services, which is becoming increasingly important. India, for example, performs a wide range of services such as accounting, customer

support, computer programming, and research and development tasks for firms in the United States and Europe. Because these services are performed for U.S. and European firms in another country, they are considered service exports from the country in which the services are performed. In the quote at the beginning of the chapter, Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, points out that the entrance of China, India, and the former Communist-bloc countries into the world economy has led to a level of globalization that exceeds anything we have seen in the past.

Why does Asia trade so much? There are many answers to this question. One answer is that wages in many Asian countries are much lower than in the industrialized world. China's low wages allow it to produce goods cheaply and then export them. But why are Chinese wages so low? One explanation is that Chinese workers are less productive (the Ricardian model presented in the next chapter explains wages in that way). Low wages cannot explain why Japan exports so much, however. Japan's wages are very high because its workers are very productive; its exports to Europe and the United States are large because its highly skilled workforce and large amount of capital (factories and machines) make it possible for Japan to produce high-quality goods in abundance. Conversely, its scarcity of raw materials explains why it imports those goods from resource-rich countries such as Australia, Canada, and the United States. Trade patterns based on the amounts of labor, capital, and natural resources found in each country are explained by the Heckscher-Ohlin trade model, the topic of a later chapter.

Other Regions The Middle East sells oil to many countries, earning  \$ 1.5 trillion in export revenues and spending \$ 1.1 trillion on imports. Like the Middle East, Russia also has reserves of oil and natural gas, which countries in Europe rely on and that are an important source of export revenue for Russia. In 2010 Russia earned \$ 534 billion in its export sales and spent \$ 302 billion on imports. The exports of the Middle East and Russia combined (together with countries around Russia like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan) total \$ 2 trillion, or another 12% of world trade.

And then there is Africa. The European nations have the closest trade links with Africa, reflecting both their proximity and the former colonial status of some African countries. Europe exported  \$ 99 billion and imported \$ 105 billion from Africa in 2010, as compared with African trade with the United States, which totaled \$ 90 billion, mostly in U.S. imports. Internal trade within Africa is also small: only \$ 71 billion in 2010. Adding up all its exports, the continent of Africa accounts for only 2% of world trade, a very small number given Africa's huge land mass and population.

In the quote at the start of the chapter, Kofi Annan, former secretary general of the United Nations, expresses the view that Africa's growth out of poverty will depend on its developing greater linkages with the world economy through trade. A thorough treatment of the difficulties faced by African and other least-developed countries is beyond the scope of this book, and we recommend that the interested reader consult a textbook on development economics. But the lessons we draw from our examination of international trade and trade policy will still hold for the African countries.

The export percentages shown in Table 1-1 add up to  $ 100\% $ (being careful not to add Europe and the Americas twice), once we include trade at the bottom of the world: Australia and New Zealand export \$ 270 billion (accounting for  $ 1.6\% $ of world exports) and import \$ 242 billion. You do not need to know all the specific percentages shown in Table 1-1, but an understanding of the broad picture (such as which regions trade the most) will be useful as we undertake our study of international trade.

# Trade Compared With Gdp

So far, we have discussed the value of trade crossing international borders. But there is a second way that trade is often reported, and that is as a ratio of trade to a country's gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all final goods produced in a year. For the United States, the average value of imports and exports (for goods and services) expressed relative to GDP was  $ 15\% $  in 2010. Most other countries have a higher ratio of trade to GDP, as shown in Table 1-2.

At the top of the list are Hong Kong (China) and Singapore, where the amount of trade exceeds their GDP! These two countries are important shipping and processing centers, so they are importing goods, processing them, and then exporting the final product to other countries. As in our iPhone example, the value-added involved in the exports ( \$ 6.50 for each iPhone) can be much less than the total value of exports (\$ 179). That explains why the total amount that countries trade can be greater than their GDP. At the bottom of the list are the United States and Japan, which are very large in economic size; Pakistan, which is only starting to engage in international trade; and Brazil and Argentina, which are far away from other importing countries.

So even though the United States is among the world's largest exporters and importers, it is nearly the smallest trading nation of the countries shown in Table 1-2 when trade is measured as a percent of a country's GDP. What is the reason for this inverse relationship? Very large countries tend to have a lot of trade among states or provinces within their borders, but that trade is not counted as part of international trade. Other countries that are not quite as large as the United States but are close to their major trading partners, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, and Canada and Mexico, tend to appear in the middle of the list in Table 1-2. Smaller countries with close neighbors, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and the smaller European nations, will have more trade spilling across their borders and have the highest ratios of trade to GDP.

# Table 1-2

Trade/GDP Ratio in 2010 This table shows the ratio of total trade to GDP for each country, where trade is calculated as (Imports + Exports)/2, including both merchandise goods and services. Countries with the highest ratios of trade to GDP tend to be small in economic size and are often important centers for shipping goods, like Hong Kong (China) and Singapore. Countries with the lowest ratios of trade to GDP tend to be very large in economic size, like Japan and the United States, or are not very open to trade because of trade barriers or their distance from other countries.

# Barriers to Trade

Table 1-2 shows the differences across countries in the amount of trade relative to GDP, but this ratio changes over time. There are many reasons, aside from country size, for the amount of trade to change. Those reasons include import tariffs, taxes that countries charge on imported goods; transportation costs of shipping from one country to another; events, such as wars and natural disasters, that lead to reduced trade; and so on. The term trade barriers refers to all factors that influence the amount of goods and services shipped across international borders. To see how these trade barriers have changed over time, Figure 1-3 graphs the ratio of trade in goods and services to GDP for a selection of countries for which historical data are available: Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and an average of countries in continental Europe (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Sweden).<sup>4</sup>

# "first Golden Age" of Trade

The period from 1890 until World War I (1914-1918) is sometimes referred to as a "golden age" of international trade. Those years saw dramatic improvements in transportation, such as the steamship and the railroad, that allowed for a great increase in the amount of international trade. Figure 1-3 shows this increase in the ratio of trade to GDP between 1890 and World War I. The United Kingdom reached the highest ratio of trade to GDP  $ (30\%) $, while Australia, Canada, and the average of European countries all exceeded $ 20\% $ at their peaks (shown in 1913 or 1920). Japan reached a ratio of trade to GDP of $ 15\% $, while the United States achieved $ 7.5\% $ , which was low in comparison with other countries (as expected for a large country) but still high by the United States' historical standards.

Interwar Period In the aftermath of World War I, the ratio of trade to GDP fell in all countries, a decline that was made worse by the Great Depression, which began in 1929, and World War II, which began in Europe in 1939. During the Great Depression, the United States adopted high tariffs called the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, named after Senator Reed Smoot from Utah and Representative Willis C. Hawley from Oregon. Signed into law in June 1930, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act raised tariffs to as high as  $ 60\% $  on many categories of imports.

These tariffs were applied by the United States to protect farmers and other industries, but they backfired by causing other countries to retaliate. Canada retaliated by applying high tariffs of its own against the United States; France used import quotas, a limitation on the quantity of an imported good allowed into a country, to restrict imports from the United States; Britain gave preferences to goods available from its former colonies; and other countries reacted, too. As reported by one economic historian:

A groundswell of resentment spread around the world and quickly led to retaliation. Italy objected to duties on hats and bonnets of straw, wool-felt hats, and olive oil; Spain reacted sharply to increases on cork and onions; Canada took umbrage at increases on maple sugar and syrup, potatoes, cream, butter, buttermilk,

Trade in Goods and Services Relative to GDP This diagram shows total trade in merchandise goods and services for each country (i.e., the average of imports and exports) divided by gross domestic product (GDP). There was a considerable increase in the ratio of trade to GDP between 1890 and 1913. This trend ended by World War I and the Great Depression, and it took many years to regain the same level of trade. Most of the industrial countries

shown did not reach the level of trade prevailing in 1913 until the 1970s. Some countries—such as Australia and the United Kingdom—did not reach their earlier levels until the end of the century. The financial crisis in 2008-2009 led to a fall in trade relative to GDP for most countries.

and skimmed milk. Switzerland was moved to boycott American typewriters, fountain pens, motor cars, and films because of increased duties on watches, clocks, embroidery, cheese and shoes. . . . Retaliation was begun long before the [Smoot-Hawley] bill was enacted into law in June 1930.

The response of these countries, initially against the United States and then against one another, led to a dramatic increase in worldwide tariffs during the interwar period. The average worldwide tariff for 35 countries from 1860 to 2010 is shown in Figure 1-4. We see that the average tariff fluctuated around  $ 15\% $ from 1860 to 1914. After World War I, however, the average tariff rose because of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and the reaction by other countries, reaching about $ 25\% $  by 1933. The high tariffs led to a dramatic fall in world trade in the interwar period, with large costs to the United States and the world economy. These costs are one reason that the Allied countries met together after World War II to develop international agreements to

keep tariffs low, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, now known as the World Trade Organization. Later in this book, we study tariffs and other trade policies in more detail and the international institutions that govern their use. The lesson from the interwar period is that high tariffs reduce the amount of trade and impose large costs on the countries involved.

# "second Golden Age" of Trade

It took many years for the world economy to regain the same level of global integration that existed before World War I. From Figure 1-3, we can see that some countries (the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia) began increasing trade immediately after the end of World War II in 1945, so their ratio of trade to GDP was much higher in 1950 than it was in 1940. Some countries did not show an increase until after 1950 and others not until after 1960. In addition to the end of World War II and tariff reductions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, improved transportation costs contributed to the growth in trade. The shipping container, invented in 1956, allowed goods to be moved by ship, rail, and truck more cheaply than before (see Headlines: A Sea Change in Shipping 50 Years Ago). As a result of all these factors, world trade grew steadily after 1950 in dollar terms and as a ratio to GDP. For this reason, the period after 1950 is called the "second golden age" of trade and globalization.

# A Sea Change in Shipping 50 Years Ago

The following article discusses the invention of the shipping container 50 years ago, which allowed goods to be shipped between countries at a much lower cost.

Globalization is having an anniversary. It was 50 years ago that Malcom McLean, an entrepreneur from North Carolina, loaded a ship with 58 35-foot containers and sailed from Newark, N.J., to Houston. He wasn't the only one to suggest that containers might make shipping more efficient. But he was the first to design a transportation system around the packaging of cargo in huge metal boxes that could be loaded and unloaded by cranes.

Container shipping eventually replaced the traditional "break-bulk" method of handling crates, barrels and bags, and stowing them loose in a ship's hold, a system in use since the days of the Phoenicians. Replacing break-bulk with cargo containers dramatically reduced shipping costs, reinvigorating markets and fueling the world economy. . . .

In 1959, according to Matson Research, the industry was loading and unloading 0.627 tons per man hour. By 1976, with container shipping well established, the figure was 4,234 tons per man hour. A ship's time in port shrank from three weeks to 18 hours. In 1950, an average commercial vessel could carry 10,000 tons at a speed of 16 knots.

With container shipping, the average commercial vessel carried 40,000 tons at a speed of 23 knots, Matson says. The numbers are even larger today. A vessel capable of carrying 6,600 20-foot containers can carry 77,000 tons at up to 24.8 knots.

"Containerization has transformed global trade in manufactured goods as dramatically as jet planes have changed

the way we travel and the Internet has changed the way we communicate," said Joseph Bonney, editor of the Journal of Commerce, the bible of the shipping industry. "The Asian economic miracle of the last two decades could not have happened without the efficient transportation that containerized shipping provides."

Many of the countries shown in Figure 1-3 have substantially exceeded the peak levels of trade relative to GDP that prevailed just before or after World War I. Canada's trade ratio grew from  $ 24\% $ in 1920 to $ 43\% $ by 2000, and then back down to $ 30\% $ in 2010 (due to reduced exports of natural gas). The average of European countries increased from $ 20\% $ in 1913 to $ 39\% $ in 2010. Likewise, the U.S. trade ratio grew from $ 7.5\% $ in 1920 to $ 15\% $ by 2010. A few countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, have only recently achieved the level of trade relative to GDP that they had prior to World War I and are now in a position to surpass that level. For the world as a whole, the ratio of trade to GDP in 2010 was about $ 30\% $, up from $ 20\% $ in 1980 and $ 12\% $  in 1970.

Near the end of the decade, in the years just before 2010, we see a fall in the ratios of trade to GDP for several countries in Figure 1-3. What happened to cause this slow-down in trade? In the fall of 2008 there was a financial crisis in the United States that quickly spread to other countries. The crisis had a substantial impact on the amount of international trade, because it sent many countries into recessions that led to a fall in both exports and imports. This fall in trade is illustrated in the final years shown in Figure 1-3, with signs of a recovery of trade in most countries by 2010. Still, it will take some years more for the world economy to again reach a level of trade, or ratio of trade to GDP, that is as high as that achieved before the financial crisis.

# 2 Migration and Foreign Direct Investment

In addition to examining the reasons for and effects of international trade (the flow of goods and services between countries), we will also analyze migration, the movement of people across borders, and foreign direct investment, the movement of capital across borders. All three of these flows affect the economy of a nation that opens its borders to interact with other nations.

# Map of Migration

In Figure 1-5, we show a map of the number of migrants around the world. The values shown are the number of people in 2005 (this is the most recent year for which these data are available) who were living (legally or illegally) in a country other than the one in which they were born. For this map, we combine two different sources of data: (1) the movement of people from one country to another, reported for just the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and shown by arrows from one country to another<sup>7</sup>, and (2) the number of foreign-born located in each region (but without data on their country of origin), shown by the bold arrows from World into Asia, Africa, and Latin America.<sup>8</sup>

In 2005 there were 62 million foreign-born people living in the OECD countries. But that was less than one-third of the total number of foreign-born people worldwide, which was 195 million. These figures show that unlike trade (much of which occurs between the OECD countries), the majority of immigration occurs outside the OECD between countries that are less wealthy. Asia, for example, was home to 53.1 million migrants in 2005, and Africa was home to 17.1 million migrants. Latin America has 6.9 million foreign-born people living there. We expect that many of

these immigrants come from the same continent where they are now living but have had to move from one country to another for employment or other reasons such as famine and war.<sup>9</sup>

Given the choice, these migrants would probably rather move to a high-wage, industrial country. But people cannot just move to another country as can the goods and services that move in international trade. All countries have restrictions on who can enter and work there. In many OECD countries, these restrictions are in place because policy makers fear that immigrants from low-wage countries will drive down the wages for a country's own less skilled workers. Whether or not that fear is justified, immigration is a hotly debated political issue in many countries, including Europe and the United States. As a result, the flow of people between countries is much less free than the flow of goods.

The limitation on migration out of the low-wage countries is offset partially by the ability of these countries to export products instead. International trade can act as a substitute for movements of labor or capital across borders, in the sense that trade can raise the living standard of workers in the same way that moving to a higher-wage country can. The increased openness to trade in the world economy since World War II has provided opportunities for workers to benefit through trade by working in export industries, even when restrictions on migration prevent them from directly earning higher incomes abroad.

European and U.S. Immigration We have just learned that restrictions on migration, especially into the wealthier countries, limit the movement of people between countries. Let us see how such restrictions are reflected in recent policy actions in two regions: the European Union and the United States.

Prior to 2004 the European Union (EU) consisted of 15 countries in western Europe, and labor mobility was very open between them. On May 1, 2004, 10 more countries of central Europe were added: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. These countries had per capita incomes that were only about one-quarter of the average per capita incomes in those western European countries that were already EU members. This large difference in wages created a strong incentive for labor migration. In principle, citizens from these newly added countries were permitted to work anywhere in the EU. As shown in Figure 1-5, in 2005 there were 24 million people from Europe living in an EU country in which they were not born. In practice, however, fears of this impending inflow of labor led to policy disagreements among the countries involved.

Germany and Austria, which border some of the new member countries, argued for a 7-year moratorium on allowing labor mobility from new members, if desired by the host countries. Britain and Ireland, on the other hand, promised to open up their countries to workers from the new EU members. In January 2007 two more countries joined the EU: Romania and Bulgaria. Legal immigration from these countries in the expanded EU, together with legal and illegal immigration from other countries, has put strains on the political system in Britain. All major political parties spoke in favor of limiting immigration from outside the EU, and this issue may have contributed to the ousting of the Labour Party in Britain in the election of May 2010.

A second example of recent migration policy is from the United States. As shown in Figure 1-5, there were 16 million people from Latin America living in the United States and Canada in 2005, and the largest group of these migrants is Mexicans living in the United States. It is estimated that today close to 13 million Mexicans are living in the United States, about half legally and half illegally. This number is more than  $ 10\% $  of Mexico's population of 115 million. The concern that immigration will drive down wages applies to Mexican migration to the United States and is amplified by the exceptionally high number of illegal immigrants. It is no surprise, then, that immigration policy is a frequent topic of debate in the United States.

There is a widespread perception among policy makers in the United States that the current immigration system is not working and needs to be fixed. In 2007 President George W. Bush attempted an immigration reform, but it was not supported by the

Congress. During his first term as president, Barack Obama also promised to pursue immigration reform. But that promise had to wait for other policy actions, most notably the health-care reform bill and the reform of the financial system following the 2008-2009 crisis, both of which delayed the discussion of immigration. As President Obama began his second term in 2013, he again promised action on immigration reform, and that idea is supported by members of both parties in the United States. As of the time of writing, it remains to be seen what type of immigration bill will be enacted during President Obama's administration.

# Map of Foreign Direct Investment

As mentioned earlier in the chapter, foreign direct investment (FDI) occurs when a firm in one country owns (in part or in whole) a company or property in another country. Figure 1-6 shows the principal stocks of FDI in 2010, with the magnitude of the stocks illustrated by the width of the lines. As we did for migration, we again combine two sources of information: (1) stocks of FDI found in the OECD countries

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/bd23c787690f94386bad5fe1b37ac81ffcb6fe4200a45341a234520ed69b11d9.jpg)

that are owned by another country, shown by arrows from the country of ownership to the country of location, and (2) FDI stocks from anywhere in the world found in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America.

In 2010 the total value of FDI stocks located in the OECD countries or owned by those countries was \(17 trillion. That value is \(85\%\) of the total world stock of FDI, which was \)19.9 trillion in 2010. So unlike our findings for immigration, the vast majority of FDI is located in or owned by firms in the OECD countries. The concentration of FDI among wealthy countries is even more pronounced than the concentration of international trade flows. The FDI stock in Africa (\(570 billion) is just over one-third of the stock in Latin America (\)1,450 billion), which in turn is less than one-half of the FDI into China and other Asian countries (\(3,991 billion). Most of this FDI is from industrial countries, but Chinese firms have begun to acquire land in Africa and Latin America for agriculture and resource extraction, as well as purchase companies in the industrial countries, as we discuss below.

FDI can be described in one of two ways: horizontal FDI or vertical FDI.

Horizontal FDI The majority of FDI occurs between industrial countries, when a firm from one industrial country owns a company in another industrial country. We refer to these flows between industrial countries as horizontal FDI. Recent examples have occurred in the automobile industry, such as the 2009 purchase of Chrysler by Fiat, an Italian firm.

There are many reasons why companies want to acquire firms in another industrial country. First, having a plant abroad allows the parent firm to avoid any tariffs from exporting to a foreign market because it can instead produce and sell locally in that market. For example, as early as the 1950s and 1960s, American auto manufacturers produced and sold cars in Europe to avoid having to pay any tariffs. In the 1980s and 1990s many Japanese auto firms opened plants in the United States to avoid U.S. import quotas (restrictions on the amount imported). Today, more Japanese cars are built in the United States than are imported from Japan.

Second, having a foreign subsidiary abroad also provides improved access to that economy because the local firms will have better facilities and information for marketing products. For example, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan and markets Toyota cars and trucks in the United States. Many other foreign firms selling in the United States have similar local retail firms. Third, an alliance between the production divisions of firms allows technical expertise to be shared and avoids possible duplication of products. Examples are the American and Canadian divisions of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, which have operated plants specializing in different vehicles on both sides of the border (in Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario) for decades. There are many reasons for horizontal FDI, which is really just a way for a firm to expand its business across international borders.

Vertical FDI The other form of FDI occurs when a firm from an industrial country owns a plant in a developing country, which we call vertical FDI. Low wages are the principal reasons that firms shift production abroad to developing countries. In the traditional view of FDI, firms from industrial economies use their technological expertise and combine this with inexpensive labor in developing countries to produce goods for the world market. This is a reasonable view of FDI in China, although as we have already seen, much of worldwide FDI does not fit this traditional view because it is between industrial countries.

In addition to taking advantage of low wages, firms have entered the Chinese market to avoid tariffs and acquire local partners to sell there. For example, China formerly had high tariffs on automobile imports, so many auto producers from the United States, Germany, and Japan established plants there, always with a Chinese partner, enabling them to sell more easily in that market. China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, which means that it has reduced its tariffs on nearly all imports, including automobiles. Nevertheless, the foreign automobile firms are planning to remain and are now beginning to export cars from China.

European and U.S. FDI Turning back now to Figure 1-6, the largest stocks of FDI are within Europe; these stocks amounted to  \$ 11.6 trillion in 2010, or more than one-half of the world total, with \$ 4.3 trillion coming from other European countries. In addition, the horizontal FDI from Europe to the United States (\$ 1.5 trillion) and that from the United States to Europe (\$ 2.0 trillion) are very substantial. An example of a European direct investment in the United States was the merger of the German company Daimler-Benz (which produces the Mercedes-Benz car) and Chrysler Corporation in 1998, resulting in the firm DaimlerChrysler. That deal lasted for fewer than 10 years, however, and in May 2007 DaimlerChrysler sold the Chrysler firm back to an American financial company, Cerberus Capital Management, so Chrysler returned to American ownership. Then, in 2009, Chrysler was again sold to a European automobile firm, Fiat. An example of American direct investment in Europe was Ford Motor Company's acquisition of the British firm Jaguar (in 1989) and the Swedish firm Volvo (in 1999). The United States consistently ranks as the top country for both inbound and outbound FDI stocks (\$ 2.5 trillion and \$ 4.3 trillion in 2010, respectively), followed by the United Kingdom and then France.

Adding up the stocks within Europe and between Europe and the United States, we find that they total \$ 7.9 trillion, or more than one-third (39%) of the world total. That share is even larger than the roughly one-quarter (27%) of worldwide trade that occurs within Europe and between Europe and the United States (see Table 1-1). This finding illustrates that the greatest amount of FDI is horizontal FDI between the industrial countries.

FDI in the Americas There are also substantial amounts of FDI shown in Figure 1-6 among the United States, Canada, and Latin America. The United States had a stock of direct investments of  \$ 290 billion in Canada in 2010, and Canada invested \$ 211 billion in the United States. The United States had a stock of direct investments of \$ 747 billion in Latin America, principally in Mexico. Brazil and Mexico are two of the largest recipients of FDI among developing countries, after China. In 2010 Mexico had a FDI stock of \$ 265 billion, and Brazil had a stock of \$ 514 billion, accounting for about one-half of the total \$ 1,450 billion in FDI to Latin America. These are examples of vertical FDI, prompted by the opportunity to produce goods at lower wages than in the industrial countries.

FDI with Asia The direct investments between the United States and Japan and between Europe and Japan are horizontal FDI. In addition to Japan, the rest of Asia shows a large amount of FDI in Figure 1-6. The United States had direct investments of  \$ 298 billion in the rest of Asia, especially China, while Europe had a direct investment of \$ 270 billion in Asia. These stocks are also examples of vertical FDI, foreign direct investment from industrial to developing countries, to take advantage of low wages.

China has become the largest recipient country for FDI in Asia and the second largest recipient of FDI in the world (after the United States). The FDI stock in China and Hong Kong was  \$ 1,476 billion in 2010, which accounts for \(37\% $  of the total FDI into China and the rest of Asia (\)4.0 trillion). There is some "double counting" in these numbers for China and Hong Kong because Hong Kong itself has direct investment in mainland China, which is funded in part by businesses on the mainland. This flow of funds from mainland China to Hong Kong and then back to China is called "round tripping," and it is estimated that one-quarter to one-half of FDI flowing into China is funded that way.

Notice in Figure 1-6 that Asia has direct investment into the United States and Europe, or what we might call "reverse-vertical FDI." Contrary to the traditional view of FDI, these are companies from developing countries buying firms in the industrial countries. Obviously, these companies are not going after low wages in the industrial countries; instead, they are acquiring the technological knowledge of those firms, which they can combine with low wages in their home countries. A widely publicized example was the purchase of IBM's personal computer division by Lenovo, a Chinese firm. What expertise did Lenovo acquire from this purchase? According to media reports, Lenovo will acquire the management and international expertise of IBM and will even hire IBM executives to run the business. Instead of using FDI to acquire inexpensive labor, Lenovo has engaged in FDI to acquire expensive and highly skilled labor, which is what it needs to succeed in the computer industry.

Another example of reverse-vertical FDI from China is the 2009 purchase of Volvo (formerly a Swedish company) from Ford Motor Company, by the Chinese automaker Geely. In a later chapter, we will discuss how automobile companies from the United States, Europe, and Japan entered the automobile industry in China by buying partial ownership in Chinese firms, which allowed the Chinese firms to learn from their foreign partners. That process of learning the best technology continues in the case of Geely purchasing Volvo from Ford, but now it is the Chinese firm that is doing the buying rather than the American, European, or Japanese firms.

In addition to acquiring technical knowledge, Chinese firms have been actively investing in foreign companies whose products are needed to meet the growing demand of its 1.3 billion people. A recent example is the proposed purchase of the American firm Smithfield Foods, one of the largest producers of pork in the United States, by the Chinese firm Shuanghui International. Rising incomes have led to increased demand for pork in China, exceeding that country's own ability to supply it. This example illustrates the more general trend of Chinese companies investing in natural resource and infrastructure projects around the world. As reported in The New York Times:

[The proposed purchase of Smithfield] fulfills a major ambition of the Chinese government, to encourage companies to venture abroad by acquiring assets, resources and technical expertise. In North America, Africa and Australia, Chinese companies, flush with cash, are buying up land and resources to help a country that is plagued by water shortages and short of arable land, a situation exacerbated by a long running property and infrastructure boom.

As China continues to industrialize, which will raise the income of its consumers and the ability of its firms to invest overseas, we can expect that its firms and government will continue to look beyond its borders to provide for the needs of its population.

# 3 Conclusions

Globalization means many things: the flow of goods and services across borders, the movement of people and firms, the spread of culture and ideas among countries, and the tight integration of financial markets around the world. Although it might seem as if such globalization is new, international trade and the integration of financial markets were also very strong in the period before World War I. The war and the Great Depression disrupted these global linkages. Since World War II world trade has grown rapidly again, even faster than the growth in world GDP, so that the ratio of trade to world GDP has risen steadily. International institutions established after World War II have promoted the growth in trade: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now known as the World Trade Organization), the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and the World Bank were all established in the postwar years to promote freer trade and economic development.

Migration across countries is not as free as international trade, and all countries have restrictions on immigration because of the fear that the inflow of workers will drive down wages. That fear is not necessarily justified. We argue in a later chapter that immigrants can sometimes be absorbed into a country with no change in wages. FDI is largely unrestricted in the industrial countries but often faces some restrictions in developing countries. China, for example, requires approval of all foreign investments and until recently, required that foreign firms have a local partner. Typically, firms invest in developing countries to take advantage of lower wages in those countries. Investments in developing countries and industrial countries enable firms to spread their business and knowledge of production processes across borders. Migration and FDI are further aspects of the globalization that has become so widespread today.

# Key Points

1. The trade balance of a country is the difference between the value of its exports and the value of its imports, and is determined by macroeconomic conditions in the country.
2. The type of goods being traded between countries has changed from the period before World War I, when standardized goods (raw materials and basic processed goods like steel) were predominant. Today, the majority of trade occurs in highly processed consumer and capital goods, which might cross borders several times during the manufacturing process.
3. A large portion of international trade is between industrial countries. Trade within Europe and

trade between Europe and the United States accounts for roughly one-quarter of total world trade.

4. Many of the trade models we study emphasize the differences between countries, but it is also possible to explain trade between countries that are similar. Similar countries will trade different varieties of goods with one another.
5. Larger countries tend to have smaller shares of trade relative to GDP because so much of their trade occurs internally. Hong Kong (China) and Singapore have ratios of trade to GDP that exceed  $ 100\% $, whereas the United States' ratio of trade to GDP in 2010 was $ 15\% $ .

6. The majority of world migration occurs into developing countries as a result of restrictions on immigration into wealthier, industrial countries.
7. International trade in goods and services acts as a substitute for migration and allows workers to improve their standard of living through working in export industries, even when they cannot migrate to earn higher incomes.

8. The majority of world FDI occurs between industrial countries. In 2010 more than one-third of the world stock of FDI was within Europe or between Europe and the United States, and  $ 85\% $  of the world stock of FDI was into or out of the OECD countries.

# Problems

1. Figures 1-2 and 1-6 rely on data from 2010, and Figure 1-5 relies on data from 2005, to map worldwide trade, migration, and FDI. Updated data for migration and FDI were not available at the time this chapter was written, but it is available for worldwide trade. In this question, you are asked to update the numbers for world trade shown in Table 1-1.

a. Go to the World Trade Organization's website at http://www.wto.org, and look for its trade data under "Documents and resources" then "International trade statistics." Look for the most recent edition of its International Trade Statistics publication, then go to "Trade by region," and find the Excel spreadsheet with "Intra- and interregional merchandise trade." Print out this table.

If you cannot find the website or spreadsheet, use the 2011 table for "Intra- and Inter-Regional Merchandise Trade" that

appears below to answer the following questions.12

b. From this table, what is the total amount of trade within Europe? What percentage of total world trade is this?

c. What is the total amount of trade (in either direction) between Europe and North America? Add that to the total trade within Europe, and calculate the percentage of this to the world total.

d. What is the total amount of trade within the Americas (i.e., between North America, Central America, South America, and within each of these regions)? What percentage of total world trade is this?

e. What is the total value of exports from Europe and the Americas, and what percentage of the world total is this?

f. What is the total value of exports from Asia, and what percentage of the world total is this?

g. What is the total value of exports from the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States,13 and what percentage of the world total is this?
h. What is the total value of exports from Africa, and what percentage of the world total is this?
i. How do your answers to (b) through (h) compare with the shares of worldwide trade shown in Table 1-1?

2. The quotation from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke at the beginning of the chapter is from a speech that he delivered in Jackson

Hole, Wyoming, on August 25, 2006, titled "Global Economic Integration: What's New and What's Not?" The full transcript of the speech is available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060825a.htm. Read this speech and answer the following questions:

a. List three ways in which international trade today does not differ from the trade that occurred before World War I.
b. List three ways in which international trade today does differ from the trade that occurred before World War I.
