# Exchange Rates Ii: the Asset Approach in the Short Run

The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again.

John Maynard Keynes, A Tract on Monetary Reform, 1923

# A

As we saw in the last chapter, the monetary approach to exchange rates

may work in the long run, but it is a poor guide to what happens in the short run. To recap this distinction, let's return to the Canada-U.S. comparison with which we opened the last chapter—only this time we'll focus on developments in the short run.

From March 2005 to March 2006, the Canadian price level (measured by the consumer price index) rose from 126.5 to 129.3, an increase of  $ 2.2\% $. The U.S. price level rose from 193.3 to 199.8, an increase of $ 3.4\% $. U.S. prices therefore increased $ 1.2\% $ more than Canadian prices. But over the same period, the loonie (Canadian dollar) rose in value from $ 0.8267 $ to $ \ $ 0.8568 \$, an appreciation of $ 3.6\% $ .<sup>1</sup>

Because Canadian baskets cost  $ 2.2\% $ more in loonie terms, and because each loonie cost $ 3.6\% $ more in U.S. dollar terms, the change in the U.S. dollar price of the Canadian basket was approximately the sum of these two changes, or about $ 5.8\% $. Over the same period, however, the U.S. dollar price of U.S. baskets rose only $ 3.4\% $. Taking the difference, Canadian baskets ended up $ 2.4\% $ more expensive than U.S. baskets, meaning that the U.S. real exchange rate with Canada rose by $ 2.4\% $, a real depreciation. This pattern was not unusual. In the previous year from March 2004 to March 2005, the real depreciation had been even larger, at $ 7.5\% $, so over two years Canadian goods rose in price by about $ 10\% $  compared with U.S. goods.

6 Conclusions

As we have already noted, evidence of this kind suggests that substantial deviations from purchasing power parity (PPP) occur in the short run: the same basket of goods generally does not cost the same everywhere at all times. These short-run failures of the monetary approach prompted economists to develop an alternative theory to explain exchange rates in the short run: the asset approach to exchange rates, the subject of this chapter.

The asset approach is based on the idea that currencies are assets. The price of the asset in this case is the spot exchange rate, the price of one unit of foreign exchange. To explain the determination of exchange rates in the short run, we can draw on what we learned about arbitrage. Recall from Chapter 13 that arbitrage plays a major role in the foreign exchange (forex, or FX) market by forcing the expected returns of two assets in different currencies to be equal. This insight led us to derive the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition. Because it characterizes the forex market equilibrium in the short run, UIP is further explored and extensively applied in this chapter.

The asset approach differs from the monetary approach in its time frame and assumptions. The monetary approach applies more to a long run of several years or even decades; the asset approach applies more to a short run of a few weeks or months, or maybe a year or so at most. In the monetary approach, we treat goods prices as perfectly flexible, a plausible assumption in the long run; in the asset approach, we assume that goods prices are sticky, a more appropriate assumption in the short run. Each theory is valid but only in the right context. Thus, rather than supplanting the monetary approach, the asset approach complements it, and provides us with the final building blocks necessary to construct a complete theory of exchange rates.

So far, we have assumed that exchange rates are determined by market forces in the goods, money, and forex markets—so our theory is relevant when the exchange rate floats, and the authorities leave it to find its own market-determined level. Can our theory also tell us anything about fixed exchange rates? Yes. At the end of the chapter, we see how the same theoretical framework can be applied to a fixed exchange rate regime.

# 1 Exchange Rates and Interest Rates in the Short Run: Uip and Fx Market Equilibrium

To begin our study of exchange rates in the short run, let's recap the crucial equilibrium condition for the forex market. In our earlier presentation, we considered a U.S. investor with two alternative investment strategies: a one-year investment in a U.S. dollar account with an interest rate  $ i_{\S} $, or a one-year investment in a euro account with an interest rate $ i_{\epsilon} $ . Here are the essentials.

# Risky Arbitrage

For the case of risky arbitrage, the forex market is in equilibrium when there is no expected difference in the rates of return on each type of currency investment in the two countries or locations. As before, we assume Home is the United States (U.S.); and Foreign is Europe (EUR, meaning the Eurozone). As we saw in the approximate uncovered interest parity condition—Equation (13-3), and repeated in this section as Equation (15-1)—this outcome requires that the dollar rate of

return on the home investment (the dollar deposit) equal the expected dollar rate of return on the foreign investment (the euro deposit),
$ $

\underbrace {i_{\S}}_{\substack {\text{Interestrate} \\ \text{ondollardeposits} \\ = \\ \text{Dollarrateofreturn} \\ \text{ondollardeposits}}} = \underbrace {i_{\epsilon}}_{\substack {\text{Interestrate} \\ \text{oneurodeposits}}} + \underbrace {\frac{\left(E_{\S / \epsilon}^{e} - E_{\S / \epsilon}\right)}{E_{\S / \epsilon}}}_{\substack {\text{Expectedrateofdepreciation} \\ \text{ofthedollar}}} \tag{15 - 1}

$ $
where each interest rate is an annual rate,  $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon} $ is today's exchange rate (the spot rate), and $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{\epsilon} $  is the expected future exchange rate that will prevail one year ahead.

The uncovered interest parity (UIP) equation is the fundamental equation of the asset approach to exchange rates, and from now on, we use it in the form of Equation (15-1). As we have seen, by rearranging this equation, we can solve it for the spot exchange rate, if we know all of the other variables. Thus, the asset approach employs the UIP equation to determine today's spot exchange rate, as illustrated in Figure 15-1. Note that the theory is useful only if we know the future expected exchange rate and the short-term interest rates. Where does that knowledge come from?

Short-Term Interest Rates The first assumption is that we know today's interest rates on deposit accounts in each country, the dollar interest rate  $ i_{\mathbb{S}} $, and the euro account interest rate $ i_{\epsilon} $ . Market participants can observe these short-term interest rates. But how are these interest rates determined, and, in particular, what is their relation to economic policy? In the next section, we explore that question to develop a fuller understanding of how exchange rates are determined.

Exchange Rate Expectations The second assumption is that we know the forecast of the future level of the exchange rate  $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}^e $ . The asset approach itself does not provide the answer, so we must look elsewhere. Where to look? In the long-run monetary approach to the exchange rate presented in the previous chapter. We can now see how the asset approach and monetary approach fit together.

Approach In this model, the nominal interest rate and expected future exchange rate are treated as known exogenous variables (in green). The model uses these variables to predict the unknown endogenous variable (in red), the current spot exchange rate.

# Equilibrium in the Fx Market: an Example

To explore the concepts we've just studied, let's work through a numerical example to show how equilibrium in the forex market is determined.

Suppose that the current European interest rate  $ i_{\epsilon} $ is $ 3\% $, and the current U.S. interest rate $ i_{\mathrm{S}} $ is $ 5\% $. Suppose also that we have made a forecast (using the long-run monetary model of exchange rates) that the expected future exchange rate $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{e} $  (in one year's time) is 1.224 dollars per euro.

Now examine Table 15-1 to see how, for various values of the spot exchange rate  $ E_{\ $ /\epsilon} $, we can calculate the domestic rate of return and expected foreign rate of return in U.S. dollars. (Remember that $ 5\% = 0.05 $, $ 3\% = 0.03 $, etc.) As you work through the table, remember that the foreign returns have two components: one due to the European interest rate $ i_{\epsilon} $  and the other due to the expected rate of depreciation of the dollar, as in Equation (15-1).

Figure 15-2 presents an FX market diagram, a graphical representation of these returns in the forex market. We plot the expected domestic and foreign returns (on the vertical axis) against today's spot exchange rate (on the horizontal axis). The domestic dollar return  $ (DR) $ (which is Home's nominal interest rate) is fixed at $ 5\% = 0.05 $  and is independent of the spot exchange rate.

According to Equation (15-1), the foreign expected dollar return  $ (FR) $ depends on the spot exchange rate and it varies as shown in Table 15-1. For example, we can infer from the table that a spot exchange rate of 1.224 implies a foreign return of $ 3\% = 0.03 $. Hence, the point (1.224, 0.03) is on the $ FR $ line in Figure 15-2. This is the special case in which there is no expected depreciation (spot and expected future exchange rates equal 1.224), so the foreign return equals the foreign country's interest rate, $ 3\% $ .

More generally, we see that the foreign return falls as the spot exchange rate  $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon} $ increases, all else equal. Why? This is clear mathematically from the right side of Equation (15-1). The intuition is as follows. If the dollar depreciates today, $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon} $  rises; a euro investment is then a more expensive (and, thus, less attractive) proposition, all else

equal. That is, \(1 moved into a European account is worth fewer euros today; this, in turn, leaves fewer euro proceeds in a year's time after euro interest has accrued. If expectations are fixed so that the future euro-dollar exchange rate \(E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{e}\) is known and unchanged, then those fewer future euros will be worth fewer future dollars. Hence, the foreign return (in dollars) goes down as \(E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}\) rises, all else equal, and the FR curve slopes downward.

What is the equilibrium level of the spot exchange rate? According to Table 15-1, the equilibrium exchange rate is  $ 1.20 \, \text{$ /€} $. Only at that exchange rate are domestic returns and foreign returns equalized. To illustrate the solution graphically, domestic and foreign returns are plotted in Figure 15-2. The FX market is in equilibrium, and foreign and domestic returns are equal, at point 1 where the $ FR $ and $ DR $  curves intersect.

# Adjustment to Forex Market Equilibrium

Our forex market equilibrium condition and its graphical representation should now be clear. But how is this equilibrium reached? It turns out that arbitrage automatically pushes the level of the exchange rate toward its equilibrium value.

To see this, suppose that the market is initially out of equilibrium, with the spot  $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon} $  exchange rate at a level too low, so that the foreign return—the right-hand side of Equation (15-1)—exceeds the domestic return (the left-hand side).

At point 2 in Figure 15-2, foreign returns are well above domestic returns. With the spot exchange rate of  $ 1.16 \, \text{€}/\text{€} $ and (from Table 15-1) an expected future exchange rate as high as $ 1.224 \, \text{€}/\text{€} $, the euro is expected to appreciate by $ 5.5\% = 0.055 $ $[= (1.224 / 1.16) - 1] $ . In addition, euros earn at an interest rate of $ 3\% $, for a whopping foreign expected return of $ 5.5\% + 3\% = 8.5\% = 0.085 $, which far exceeds the domestic return of $ 5\% $. At point 2, in other words, the euro offers too high a return; equivalently, it is too cheap. Traders want to sell dollars and buy euros. These market pressures bid up the price of a euro: the dollar starts to depreciate against the euro, causing $ E_{\text{€}} $  to rise, which moves foreign and domestic returns into equality and forces the exchange rate back toward equilibrium at point 1.

The same idea applies to a situation in which the spot exchange rate  $ E_{\ $ / \epsilon} $ is initially too high. At point 3 in Figure 15-2, foreign and domestic returns are not equal: the exchange rate is $ 1.24 \, \text{€/€} $. Given where the exchange rate is expected to be in a year's time (1.224 $ / \epsilon $), paying a high price of $ 1.24 \, \text{€/€} $ today means the euro is expected to depreciate by about $ 1.3\% = 0.013 $ [=1.224/1.24 - 1]. If euro deposits pay $ 3\% $, and euros are expected to depreciate $ 1.3\% $, this makes for a net foreign return of just $ 1.7\% $, well below the domestic return of $ 5\% = 0.05 $ . In other words, at point 3, the euro offers too low a return; equivalently, it is too expensive today. Traders will want to sell euros.

Only at point 1 is the euro trading at a price at which the foreign return equals the domestic return. At point 1, the euro is neither too cheap nor too expensive—its price is just right for uncovered interest parity to hold, for arbitrage to cease, and for the forex market to be in equilibrium.

# Changes in Domestic and Foreign Returns and Fx Market Equilibrium

When economic conditions change, the two curves depicting domestic and foreign returns shift. In the case of the domestic return curve, the movements are easy to understand because the curve is a horizontal line that intersects the vertical axis at the domestic interest rate. If the domestic interest changes, the curve shifts up or down. Shifts in the foreign returns curve are a bit more complicated because there are two parts to the foreign return: the foreign interest rate plus any expected change in the exchange rate.

To gain greater familiarity with the model, let's see how the FX market example shown in Figure 15-2 responds to three separate shocks:

A higher domestic interest rate,  $ i_{\mathrm{S}} = 7\% $ A lower foreign interest rate, $ i_{\epsilon} = 1\% $ A lower expected future exchange rate, E€/€ = 1.20 \$ /€

These three cases are shown in Figure 15-3, panels (a), (b), and (c). In all three cases, the shocks make dollar deposits more attractive than euro deposits, but for different reasons. Regardless of the reason, however, the shocks we examine all lead to dollar appreciations.

A Change in the Domestic Interest Rate In Figure 15-3, panel (a), when  $ i_{\mathrm{S}} $ rises to $ 7\% $, the domestic return is increased by $ 2\% $ so the domestic return curve $ DR $ shifts up by $ 2\% = 0.02 $ from $ DR_{1} $ to $ DR_{2} $. The foreign return is unaffected. Now, at the initial equilibrium spot exchange rate of $ 1.20 $ $\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E} $ , the domestic return (point 4) is higher than the foreign return. Traders sell euros and buy dollars; the dollar appreciates to $ 1.177 $ $ \mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E} $  at the new equilibrium, point 5. The foreign return and domestic return are equal once again, and UIP holds once more.

FIGURE 15-3

(a) A Change in the Home Interest Rate A rise in the dollar interest rate from 5% to 7% increases domestic returns, shifting the  $ DR $ curve up from $ DR_{1} $ to $ DR_{2} $. At the initial equilibrium exchange rate of $ 1.20 $ $/€ on $ DR_{2} $, domestic returns are above foreign returns at point 4. Dollar deposits are more attractive and the dollar appreciates from $ 1.20 $ $/€ to $ 1.177 \$ $/€. The new equilibrium is at point 5.

(b) A Change in the Foreign Interest Rate A fall in the euro interest rate from  $ 3 \% $ to $ 1 \% $ lowers foreign expected dollar returns, shifting the FR curve down from $ F R_{1} $ to $ F R_{2} $. At the initial equilibrium exchange rate of 1.20 $ \mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E} $ on $ F R_{2} $, foreign returns are below domestic returns at point 6. Dollar deposits are more attractive and the dollar appreciates from 1.20 $ \mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E} $ to 1.177 $ \mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E} $ . The new equilibrium is at point 7.

(c) A Change in the Expected Future Exchange Rate A fall in the expected future exchange rate from 1.22 to 1.20 lowers foreign expected dollar returns, shifting the FR curve down from  $ FR_{1} $ to $ FR_{2} $. At the initial equilibrium exchange rate of $ 1.20 \, \text{$ /€} $ on $ FR_{2} $, foreign returns are below domestic returns at point 6. Dollar deposits are more attractive at the dollar appreciates from $ 1.20 \, \text{$ /€} $ to $ 1.177 \, \text{$ /€} $ . The net equilibrium is at point 7.

A Change in the Foreign Interest Rate In Figure 15-3, panel (b), when  $ i_{\epsilon} $ falls to $ 1\% $, euro deposits now pay a lower interest rate (1% versus 3%). The foreign return curve $ FR $ shifts down by $ 2\% = 0.02 $ from $ FR_{1} $ to $ FR_{2} $. The domestic return is unaffected. Now, at the old equilibrium rate of $ 1.20 $ /€, the foreign return (point 6) is lower than the domestic return. Traders sell euros and buy dollars; the dollar appreciates to $ 1.177 $  /€ at the new equilibrium, point 7, and UIP holds once more.

A Change in the Expected Future Exchange Rate In Figure 15-3, panel (c), a decrease in the expected future exchange rate  $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}^e $ lowers the foreign return because a future euro is expected to be worth fewer dollars in the future. The foreign return curve $ FR $ shifts down from $ FR_1 $ to $ FR_2 $. The domestic return is unaffected. At the old equilibrium rate of $ 1.20 $ $\mathbb{E} / \mathbb{E} $ , the foreign return (point 6) is lower than the domestic return. Again, traders sell euros and buy dollars, causing the dollar to appreciate and the spot exchange rate to fall to $ 1.177 $ $ \mathbb{E} / \mathbb{E} $ . The new equilibrium is point 7.

# Summary

The FX market diagram, with its representation of domestic returns and foreign returns, is central to our analysis in this chapter and later in the book. Be sure that you understand that domestic returns depend only on the home interest rate  $ i_{\S} $ but that foreign returns depend on both the foreign interest rate $ i_{\epsilon} $ and the expected future exchange rate $ E_{\S/\epsilon}^{e} $ . Remember: any change that raises (lowers) the foreign return relative to the domestic return makes euro deposits more (less) attractive to investors, so that traders will buy (sell) euro deposits. The traders' actions push the forex market toward a new equilibrium at which the dollar will have depreciated (appreciated) against the euro.

To check your understanding, you might wish to rework the three examples and the figures for the opposite cases of a decrease in  $ i_{\mathbb{S}} $, an increase in $ i_{\mathbb{C}} $, and an increase in $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{C}}^{e} $ ; constructing the equivalent of Table 15-1 for each case may also prove helpful.

# 2 Interest Rates in the Short Run: Money Market Equilibrium

The previous section laid out the essentials of the asset approach to exchange rates. Figure 15-1 sums up the uncovered interest parity relationship at the heart of the asset approach. The spot exchange rate is the output (endogenous variable) of this model, and the expected future exchange rate and the home and foreign interest rates are the inputs (exogenous variables). But where do these inputs come from? In the last chapter, we developed a theory of the long-run exchange rate, the monetary approach, which can be used to forecast the future exchange rate. That leaves us with just one unanswered question: How are current interest rates determined?

# Money Market Equilibrium in the Short Run: How Nominal Interest Rates Are Determined

Having seen how the supply and demand for money work in the previous chapter, we can build on that foundation here. We consider two money markets in two locations: the United States and Europe. Both markets are in equilibrium with money demand

equal to money supply. In both locations, the money supply is controlled by a central bank and is taken as given; the demand for real money balances  $ M / P = L(i)Y $ is a function of the interest rate $ i $ and real income $ Y $ .

The Assumptions It is important to understand the key difference between the way we approach money market equilibrium in the short run (in this chapter) and the way we approached it in the long run (in the last chapter).

In the last chapter, we made the following long-run assumptions:

In the long run, the price level  $ P $  is fully flexible and adjusts to bring the money market to equilibrium.
In the long run, the nominal interest rate  $ i $  equals the world real interest rate plus domestic inflation.

In this chapter, we make short-run assumptions that are quite different:

In the short run, the price level is sticky; it is a known predetermined variable, fixed at  $ P = \overline{P} $  (the bar indicates a fixed value).
In the short run, the nominal interest rate  $ i $  is fully flexible and adjusts to bring the money market to equilibrium.

Why do we make different assumptions in the short run?

First, why assume prices are now sticky? The assumption of sticky prices, also called nominal rigidity, is common to the study of macroeconomics in the short run. Economists have many explanations for price stickiness. Nominal wages may be sticky because of long-term labor contracts. Nominal product prices may be sticky because of contracts and menu costs; that is, firms may find it costly to frequently change their output prices. Thus, although it is reasonable to assume that all prices are flexible in the long run, they may not be in the short run.

Second, why assume that interest rates are now flexible? In the previous chapter, we showed that nominal interest rates are pinned down by the Fisher effect (or real interest parity) in the long run: in that case, the home nominal interest rate was equal to the world real interest rate plus the home rate of inflation. However, recall that this result does not apply in the short run because it is derived from purchasing power parity—which, as we know, only applies in the long run. Indeed, we saw evidence that in the short run real interest rates fluctuate in ways that deviate from real interest parity.

The Model With these explanations of our short-run assumptions in hand, we can now use the same general monetary model of the previous chapter and write down expressions for money market equilibrium in the two countries as follows:
$ $

\underbrace {\frac{M_{U S}}{\overline {{P}}_{U S}}}_{\text{U .S .s up pl yo f} \quad \text{re al mo ne yb al an ce s}} = \underbrace {L (i_{\S}) \times Y_{U S}}_{\text{U .S .d em an df or} \quad \text{re al mo ne yb al an ce s}} \tag {15-2}

$ $

$ $

\underbrace {\frac{M_{E U R}}{\overline {{P}}_{E U R}}}_{\text{Eu ro pe an su pp ly of}} = \underbrace {L \left(i_{\epsilon}\right) \times Y_{E U R}}_{\text{Eu ro pe an dm an df or}} \tag {15-3}

$ $
To recap: In the long run, prices adjust to clear the money market and bring money demand and money supply into line. In the short run, when prices are sticky, such adjustment is not possible. However, nominal interest rates are free to adjust. In the short run, the nominal interest rate in each country adjusts to bring money supply and money demand into equilibrium.

# Money Market Equilibrium in the Short Run: Graphical Solution

Figure 15-4 represents the U.S. money market (a similar diagram applies to the European market). On the horizontal axis is the quantity of U.S. real money balances  $ M_{US} / P_{US} $ and on the vertical axis is the U.S. nominal interest rate $ i_{\S} $. The vertical line represents the supply of real money balances; this supply is fixed by the central bank at the level $ M_{US}^{1} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $ and is independent of the level of the interest rate. The downward-sloping line represents the demand for real money balances, $ L(i_{\S}) \times Y_{US} $. Demand decreases as the U.S. nominal interest rate increases because the opportunity cost of holding money rises and people don't want to hold high money balances. The money market is in equilibrium at point 1: the demand and supply of real money balances are equal at $ M_{US}^{1} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $ and at a nominal interest rate $ i_{\S}^{1} $ .

# Adjustment to Money Market Equilibrium in the Short Run

If interest rates are flexible in the short run, as we assume they are, there is nothing to prevent them from adjusting to clear the money market. But how do market forces ensure that a nominal interest rate  $ i_{\mathrm{S}}^{1} $  is attained? The adjustment process works as follows.

Suppose instead that the interest rate was  $ i_{\mathrm{S}}^{2} $ , so that we were at point 2 on the real money demand curve. At this interest rate, real money demand is less than real money supply. In the aggregate, the central bank has put more money in the hands of the public than the public wishes to hold. The public will want to reduce its cash holdings

# Equilibrium in the Home Money

Market The supply and demand for real money balances determine the nominal interest rate. The money supply curve (MS) is vertical at  $ M_{US}^{1} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $ because the quantity of money supplied does not depend on the interest rate. The money demand curve (MD) is downward-sloping because an increase in the interest rate raises the cost of holding money, thus lowering the quantity demanded. The money market is in equilibrium when the nominal interest rate $ i_{\S}^{1} $  is such that real money demand equals real money supply (point 1). At points 2 and 3, demand does not equal supply and the interest rate will adjust until the money market returns to equilibrium.

by exchanging money for interest-bearing assets such as bonds, saving accounts, and so on. That is, they will save more and seek to lend their money to borrowers. But borrowers will not want to borrow more unless the cost of borrowing falls. So the interest rate will be driven down as eager lenders compete to attract scarce borrowers. As this happens, back in the money market, in Figure 15-4, we move from point 2 back toward equilibrium at point 1.

A similar story can be told if the money market is initially at point 3, where there is an excess demand for money. In this case, the public wishes to reduce their savings in the form of interest-bearing assets and turn them into cash. Now fewer loans are extended. The loan market will suffer an excess demand. But borrowers will not want to borrow less unless the cost of borrowing rises. So the interest rate will be driven up as eager borrowers compete to attract scarce lenders. These adjustments end only when point 1 is reached and there is no excess supply of real money balances.

# Another Building Block: Short-run Money Market Equilibrium

This model of the money market may be familiar from previous courses in macroeconomics. The lessons that are important for our theory of exchange rates are summed up in Figure 15-5. We treat the price level in each country as fixed and known in the short run. We also assume that the money supply and real income in each country are known. The equilibrium equations for the money market, Equations (15-2) and (15-3), then tell us the interest rates in each country. Once these are known, we can put them to use in another building block seen earlier: the interest rates can be plugged into the fundamental equation of the asset approach to exchange rate determination, Equation (15-1), along with the future expected exchange rate derived from a forecast based on the long-run monetary model of the previous chapter. In that way, the spot exchange rate can finally be determined.

# Changes in Money Supply and the Nominal Interest Rate

Money market equilibrium depends on money supply and money demand. If either changes, the equilibrium will change. To help us better understand how exchange rates are determined, we need to understand how these changes occur.

(b) Increase in Money Demand, MD

Home Money Market with Changes in Money Supply and Money Demand In panel (a), with a fixed price level  $ \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $, an increase in nominal money supply from $ M_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} $ causes an increase in real money supply from $ M_{US}^{1} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $. The nominal interest rate falls from $ i_{\S}^{1} $ to $ i_{\S}^{2} $  to restore equilibrium at

point 2. In panel (b), with a fixed price level  $ \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $, an increase in real income from $ Y_{US}^{1} $ to $ Y_{US}^{2} $ causes real money demand to increase from $ MD_{1} $ to $ MD_{2} $. To restore equilibrium at point 2, the interest rate rises from $ i_{\S}^{1} $ to $ i_{\S}^{2} $ .

Figure 15-6, panel (a), shows how the money market responds to a monetary policy change consisting of an increase in Home (U.S.) nominal money supply from  $ M_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} $. Because, by assumption, the U.S. price level is fixed in the short run at $ \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $, the increase in nominal money supply causes an increase in real money supply from $ M_{US}^{1} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $. In the figure, the money supply curve shifts to the right from $ MS_{1} $ to $ MS_{2} $. Point 1 is no longer an equilibrium; at the interest rate $ i_{\S}^{1} $, there is now an excess supply of real money balances. As people move their dollars into interest-bearing assets to be loaned out, the interest rate falls from $ i_{\S}^{1} $ to $ i_{\S}^{2} $ , at which point the money market is again in equilibrium at point 2. By the same logic, a reduction in the nominal money supply will raise the interest rate.

To sum up, in the short run, all else equal, an increase in a country's money supply will lower the country's nominal interest rate; a decrease in a country's money supply will raise the country's nominal interest rate.

Fortunately, our graphical analysis shows that, for a given money demand curve, setting a money supply level uniquely determines the interest rate and vice versa. Hence, for many purposes, the money supply or the interest rate may be used as a policy instrument. In practice, most central banks tend to use the interest rate as their policy instrument because the money demand curve may not be stable, and the fluctuations caused by this instability would lead to unstable interest rates if the money supply were set at a given level as the policy instrument.

# Can Central Banks Always Control the Interest Rate? a Lesson from the Crisis of 2008-2009

In our analyses so far, we have assumed that central banks can control the money market interest rate, and that they can effectively do so whether they set the interest rate or the money supply. These assumptions are critical in this chapter and in the rest of this book. But are they really true? In general, perhaps, but policy operations by central banks can be undermined by financial market disruptions. Recent events in many countries illustrate the problem.

In the United States, for example, the Federal Reserve sets as its policy rate the interest rate that banks charge each other for the overnight loan of the money they hold at the Fed. In normal times, changes in this cost of short-term funds for the banks are usually passed through into the market rates the banks charge to borrowers on loans such as mortgages, corporate loans, auto loans, and so forth, as well as on interbank loans between the banks themselves. This process is one of the most basic elements in the so-called transmission mechanism through which the effects of monetary policy are eventually felt in the real economy.

In the recent crisis, however, banks regarded other banks and borrowers (and even themselves) as facing potentially catastrophic risks. As a result, they lent much less freely and when they did loan, they charged much higher interest rates to compensate themselves for the risk of the loan suffering a loss or default. Thus, although the Fed brought its policy rate all the way down from  $ 5.25\% $ to $ 0\% $  in 2007 and 2008, there was no similar decrease in market rates. In fact, market interest rates barely moved at all, and even the credit that was available at more favorable rates was often restricted by tighter lending standards; total credit expanded very little, and refinancings were limited.

A second problem arose once policy rates hit the zero lower bound (ZLB). At that point, the central banks' capacity to lower the policy rate further was exhausted. However, many central banks wanted to keep applying downward pressure to market rates to calm financial markets. The Fed's response was a policy of quantitative easing.

Usually, the Fed expands base money M0 by either lending to banks which put up safe government bonds as collateral, or by buying government bonds outright in open-market operations—although these actions are taken only in support of the Fed's interest rate target. But in the crisis, and with interest rates stuck at a floor, the Fed engaged in a number of extraordinary policy actions to push more money out more quickly:

1. It expanded the range of credit securities it would accept as collateral to include lower-grade, private-sector bonds.
2. It expanded the range of securities that it would buy outright to include private-sector credit instruments such as commercial paper and mortgage-backed securities.
3. It expanded the range of counterparties from which it would buy securities to include some nonbank institutions such as primary dealers and money market funds.

As a result of massive asset purchases along these lines, M0 in the United States more than doubled to over a trillion dollars. However, there was very little change in M1 or M2, indicating that banks had little desire to translate the cash they were receiving from the Fed into the new loans and new deposits that would expand the broad money supply.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/aac817e4ce187682b0f9a6637006db0a83e7fb3001511969fe0ce8c6d04c47d8.jpg)
A broken transmission: the Fed's extraordinary interventions did little to change private credit market interest rates from 2008 through 2009.

Similar crisis actions were taken by the Bank of England and, eventually, by the European Central Bank (ECB); both expanded their collateral rules, although their outright purchase programs were more narrowly focused on aggressive use of open-market operations to purchase large quantities of U.K. and Eurozone government bonds (though in the ECB's case this included low-grade bonds from crisis countries such as Greece and Portugal).

To sum up, with the traditional transmission mechanism broken, central banks had to find different

tools. In the Fed's case, by directly intervening in markets for different types of private credit at different maturities, policy makers hoped to circumvent the impaired transmission mechanism. Would matters have been much worse if the central banks had done nothing at all? It's hard to say. However, if the aim was to lower market interest rates in a meaningful way and expand broader monetary aggregates, it is not clear that these policies had significant economic effects.

# Changes in Real Income and the Nominal Interest Rate

Figure 15-6, panel (b), shows how the money market responds to an increase in home (U.S.) real income from  $ Y_{US}^{1} $ to $ Y_{US}^{2} $. The increase in real income causes real money demand to increase as reflected in the shift from $ MD_{1} $ to $ MD_{2} $. At the initial interest rate $ i_{\mathrm{S}}^{1} $, there is now an excess demand for real money balances. To restore equilibrium at point 2, the interest rate rises from $ i_{\mathrm{S}}^{1} $ to $ i_{\mathrm{S}}^{2} $  to encourage people to hold lower dollar balances. Similarly, a reduction in real income will lower the interest rate.

To sum up, in the short run, all else equal, an increase in a country's real income will raise the country's nominal interest rate; a decrease in a country's real income will lower the country's nominal interest rate.

# The Monetary Model: the Short Run Versus the Long Run

The short-run implications of the model we have just discussed differ from the long-run implications of the monetary approach we presented in the previous chapter. It is important that we look at these differences, and understand how and why they arise.

Consider the following example: the home central bank that previously kept the money supply constant suddenly switches to an expansionary policy. In the following year, it allows the money supply to grow at a rate of  $ 5\% $ .

If such annual expansions are expected to be a permanent policy in the long run, the predictions of the long-run monetary approach and Fisher effect are clear. All else equal, a five percentage point increase in the rate of home money growth causes a five percentage point increase in the rate of home inflation and a five percentage point increase in the home nominal interest rate. The home interest rate will then rise in the long run when prices are flexible.

If this expansion is expected to be temporary, then the short-run model we have just studied in this chapter tells a very different story. All else equal, if the home money supply expands, the immediate effect is an excess supply of real money balances. The home interest rate will then fall in the short run when prices are sticky.

These different outcomes illustrate the importance of the assumptions we make about price flexibility. They also point out the importance of the nominal anchor in monetary policy formulation and the constraints that central banks have to confront. The different outcomes also explain some apparently puzzling linkages among money, interest rates, and exchange rates. In both of the previous cases, an expanded money supply leads to a weaker currency. However, in the short run, low interest rates and a weak currency go together, whereas in the long run, high interest rates and a weak currency go together.

What is the intuition for these findings? In the short run, when we study the impact of a lower interest rate and we say "all else equal," we have assumed that expectations have not changed concerning future exchange rates (or money supply or inflation). In other words, we assume (implicitly) a temporary policy that does not tamper with the nominal anchor. In the long run, if the policy turns out to be permanent, this assumption is inappropriate; prices are flexible and money growth, inflation, and expected depreciation now all move in concert—in other words, the "all else" is no longer equal.

A good grasp of these key differences between the short- and long-run approaches is essential to understanding how exchange rates are determined. To cement our understanding, in the rest of the chapter we explore the different implications of temporary and permanent policy changes. To make our exploration a bit easier, we now lay out the short-run model in a succinct, graphical form.

# 3 the Asset Approach: Applications and Evidence

To simplify the graphical presentation of the asset approach, we focus on conditions in the home economy; a similar approach can be used for the foreign economy. For illustration we again assume that Home is the United States and Foreign is Europe meaning the Eurozone.

# The Asset Approach to Exchange Rates: Graphical Solution

Figure 15-7 shows two markets: panel (a) shows the home money market (for the United States), and panel (b) shows the FX market diagram (for the dollar-euro market). This figure summarizes the asset approach in the short run.

The U.S. Money Market Panel (a) depicts equilibrium in the U.S. money market. The horizontal axis shows the quantity of U.S. real money balances demanded or supplied,  $ M_{US} / P_{US} $. The vertical axis shows the U.S. nominal interest rate $ i_{\mathrm{S}} $ . Two relationships are shown:

1. The vertical line  $ MS $ represents the U.S. real money supply. The line is vertical because (i) the nominal U.S. money supply $ M_{US} $ is treated as exogenous (known), because it is set by the home central bank, and (ii) the U.S. price level $ \overline{P}_{US} $  is treated as exogenous (known) in the short run because prices are sticky.

(b) FX Market

Equilibrium in the Money Market and the FX Market The figure summarizes the equilibria in the two asset markets in one diagram. In panel (a), in the home (U.S.) money market, the home nominal interest rate  $ i_{\S}^{1} $  is determined by the home levels of real money supply MS and demand MD with equilibrium at point 1.

In panel (b), in the dollar-euro FX market, the spot exchange rate  $ E_{\mathfrak{S} / \mathfrak{E}}^{1} $ is determined by foreign and domestic expected returns, with equilibrium at point $ 1' $ . Arbitrage forces the domestic and foreign returns in the FX market to be equal, a result that depends on capital mobility.

2. The curve  $ MD $ on the diagram represents the U.S. demand for real money balances, $ L(i_{\S})Y_{US} $. It slopes down because, when the home nominal interest rate $ i_{\S} $ rises, the opportunity cost of holding money increases, and demand falls. For now, we also assume that the U.S. real income level $ Y_{US} $  is exogenous (given) and fixed in the short run.

In equilibrium, money demand equals money supply, the quantity of real money demanded and supplied is  $ M_{US}^{1} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $, and the nominal interest rate is $ i_{\S}^{1} $  (point 1).

The Market for Foreign Exchange Panel (b) depicts equilibrium in the FX market. The horizontal axis shows the spot exchange rate,  $ E_{\mathrm{S} / \ell} $ . The vertical axis shows U.S. dollar returns on home and foreign deposits. Two relationships are shown:

1. The downward-sloping foreign return curve  $ FR $ shows the relationship between the exchange rate and the expected dollar rate of return on foreign deposits $ [i_{\epsilon} + (E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{e} - E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}) / E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}] $. The European interest rate $ i_{\epsilon} $ is treated as exogenous (given); it is determined in the European money market, which is not shown in this figure. The expected future exchange rate $ E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{e} $  is treated as exogenous (given); it is determined by a forecast obtained from the long-run model we developed in the previous chapter.
2. The horizontal domestic return line  $ DR $ shows the dollar rate of return on U.S. deposits, which is the U.S. nominal interest rate $ i_{\S} $. It is horizontal at $ i_{\S}^{1} $  because this is the U.S. interest rate determined in the home money market in panel (a), and it is the same regardless of the spot exchange rate.

In equilibrium, foreign and domestic returns are equal (uncovered interest parity holds) and the FX market is in equilibrium at point  $ 1' $ .

Capital Mobility Is Crucial We assume that the FX market is subject to the arbitrage forces we have studied and that uncovered interest parity will hold. But this is true only if there are no capital controls: as long as capital can move freely between home and foreign capital markets, domestic and foreign returns will be equalized. Our assumption that  $ DR $ equals $ FR $ depends on capital mobility. If capital controls are imposed, there is no arbitrage and no reason why $ DR $ has to equal $ FR $ .

Putting the Model to Work With this graphical apparatus in place, it is relatively straightforward to solve for the exchange rate given knowledge of all the known (exogenous) variables we have just specified.

To solve for the exchange rate, we start in the home money market in panel (a) on the horizontal axis, at the level of real money supply  $ M_{US}^{1} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $; we trace upward along MS to MD at point 1, to find the current home interest rate $ i_{\S}^{1} $. We then trace right and move across from the home money market to the FX market in panel (b), since the home interest rate is the same as domestic return $ DR $ in the FX market. We eventually meet the $ FR $ curve at point $ 1' $. We then trace down and read off the equilibrium exchange rate $ E_{\S/\epsilon}^{1} $ .

Our graphical treatment shows that solving the model is as simple as tracing a path around the diagrams. While we gain in simplicity, we also lose some generality because one market, the foreign money market, has been left out of the analysis. However, the same analysis also applies to the foreign country. As a quick check that you understand the logic of the asset approach to exchange rates, you might try to construct the equivalent of Figure 15-7 under the assumption that Europe is Home and the United States is Foreign. (Hint: In the FX market, you will need to treat the home [European] expected future exchange rate  $ E_{\epsilon/\S}^{\epsilon} $ and the foreign [U.S.] interest rate $ i_{\S} $  as given. Take care with the currency units of every variable when making the switch.)

# Short-run Policy Analysis

The graphical exposition in Figure 15-7 shows how the asset approach works to determine the exchange rate. This approach can be used to analyze the impacts of economic policy or other shocks to the economy.

The most straightforward shocks we can analyze are temporary shocks because they affect only the current state of the money and foreign exchange markets and do not affect expectations about the future. In this section, we use the model to see what happens when there is a temporary, short-run increase in the money supply by the central bank.

A Temporary Shock to the Home Money Supply We take the model of Figure 15-7 and assume that, apart from the home money supply, all exogenous variables remain unchanged and fixed at the same level. Thus, foreign money supply, home and foreign real income and price levels, and the expected future exchange rate are all fixed.

The initial state of all markets is shown in Figure 15-8. The home money market is in equilibrium at point 1 where home money supply  $ MS $ and money demand $ MD $ are equal at the home nominal interest rate $ i_{s}^{1} $ . The foreign exchange market is in

(b) FX Market

Temporary Expansion of the Home Money Supply In panel (a), in the home money market, an increase in home money supply from  $ M_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} $ causes an increase in real money supply from $ M_{US}^{1} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $. To keep real money demand equal to real money supply, the interest rate falls from $ i_{\S}^{1} $ to $ i_{\S}^{2} $ , and the

new money market equilibrium is at point 2. In panel (b), in the FX market, to maintain the equality of domestic and foreign expected returns, the exchange rate rises (the dollar depreciates) from  $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{1} $ to $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{2} $, and the new FX market equilibrium is at point $ 2' $ .

equilibrium at point  $ 1' $, where domestic return $ DR $ equals foreign return $ FR $, where $ i_{\S}^{1} = i_{\epsilon}^{1} + (E_{\S/\epsilon}^{e} - E_{\S/\epsilon}^{1}) / E_{\S/\epsilon} $, and the spot exchange rate is $ E_{\S/\epsilon}^{1} $ .

Suppose the U.S. money supply is increased temporarily from  $ M_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} $. Under the assumption of sticky prices, $ \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $ does not change, so the U.S. real money supply will increase to $ M_{US}^{2} / \overline{P}_{US}^{1} $, and the real money supply curve shifts from $ MS_{1} $ to $ MS_{2} $ in panel (a). U.S. real money demand is unchanged, so the money market equilibrium shifts from point 1 to point 2 and the nominal interest rate falls from $ i_{\S}^{1} $ to $ i_{\S}^{2} $ . The expansion of the U.S. money supply causes the U.S. nominal interest rate to fall.

A temporary monetary policy shock leaves the long-run expected exchange rate  $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{e} $ unchanged. Assuming all else equal, European monetary policy is also unchanged, and the euro interest rate remains fixed at $ i_{\epsilon} $. If $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{e} $ and $ i_{\epsilon} $ are unchanged, then the foreign-return $ FR $ curve in panel (b) is unchanged and the new FX market equilibrium is at point $ 2' $. The lower domestic return $ i_{\mathbb{S}}^{2} $ is matched by a lower foreign return. The foreign return is lower because the U.S. dollar has depreciated from $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{1} $ to $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{2} $ .

The result is intuitive, and we have seen each of the steps previously. We now just put them all together: a home monetary expansion lowers the home nominal interest rate, which is also the domestic return in the forex market. This makes foreign deposits more attractive and makes traders wish to sell home deposits and buy foreign deposits. This, in turn, makes the home exchange rate increase (depreciate). However, this depreciation makes foreign deposits less attractive (all else equal). Eventually, the equality of foreign and domestic returns is restored, uncovered

interest parity holds again, and the foreign exchange market reaches a new short-run equilibrium.

A Temporary Shock to the Foreign Money Supply We now repeat the previous analysis for a shock to the foreign money supply. All other exogenous variables remain unchanged and fixed at their initial levels. Thus, home money supply, home and foreign real income and price levels, and the expected future exchange rate are all fixed. The initial state of all markets is shown in Figure 15-9: the home money market is in equilibrium at point 1 and the FX market is in equilibrium at point 2.

Let's see what happens when the foreign money supply increases temporarily. Because changes in the foreign money supply have no effect on the home money market in panel (a), equilibrium remains at point 1 and the home nominal interest rate stays at  $ i_{\S}^{1} $ .

The shock is temporary, so long-run expectations are unchanged, and the expected exchange rate  $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}^{e} $ stays fixed in panel (b). However, because the foreign money supply has expanded temporarily, the euro interest rate falls from $ i_{\epsilon}^{1} $ to $ i_{\epsilon}^{2} $. Foreign returns are diminished, all else equal, by a fall in euro interest rates, so the foreign return curve $ FR $ shifts downward from $ FR_{1} $ to $ FR_{2} $. On the horizontal axis in panel (b), we can see that at the new FX market equilibrium (point 2') the home exchange rate has decreased (the U.S. dollar has appreciated) from $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}^{1} $ to $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}^{2} $ .

This result is also intuitive. A foreign monetary expansion lowers the foreign nominal interest rate, which lowers the foreign return in the forex market. This makes foreign deposits less attractive and makes traders wish to buy home deposits and sell foreign

FIGURE 15-9

Temporary Expansion of the Foreign Money Supply In panel (a), there is no change in the home money market. In panel (b), an increase in the foreign money supply causes the foreign (euro) interest rate to fall from  $ i_{\epsilon}^{1} $ to $ i_{\epsilon}^{2} $. For a U.S. investor, this lowers the foreign return $ i_{\epsilon} + (E_{\S/\epsilon}^{\epsilon} - E_{\S/\epsilon}) / E_{\S/\epsilon} $, all else equal. To maintain the equality of domestic and foreign returns in the FX market, the exchange rate falls (the dollar appreciates) from $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}^{1} $ to $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}^{2} $, and the new FX market equilibrium is at point $ 2' $ .

deposits. This, in turn, makes the home exchange rate decrease (appreciate). However, this appreciation makes foreign deposits more attractive (all else equal). Eventually, the equality of foreign and domestic returns is restored, uncovered interest parity holds again, and the foreign exchange market reaches a new short-run equilibrium.

To ensure you have grasped the model fully, you might try two exercises. First, derive the predictions of the model for temporary contractions in the home or foreign money supplies. Second, go back to the version of Figure 15-7 that you constructed from the European perspective and generate predictions using that version of the model, first for a temporary expansion of the money supply in Europe and then for a temporary expansion in the United States. Do you get the same answers?

# Application

# The Rise and Fall of the Dollar, 1999-2004

In the 1990s, many developed countries adopted monetary policies that established clear, long-run nominal anchors. The European Central Bank, for example, adopted an explicit inflation target. The Federal Reserve in the United States operated with a more implicit target, but nonetheless could claim to have a credible anchor, too.

The Fisher effect tells us that nominal anchoring of this kind ought to keep nominal interest rate differentials between the United States and the Eurozone roughly constant in the long run. But in the short run, this constraint does not apply, so central banks have some freedom to temporarily change their monetary policies. In the years 2000 to 2004, such flexibility was put to use and interest rates in the United States and Europe followed very different tracks.

In later chapters, we study in more detail why central banks alter monetary policy in the short run, but for now we focus on how such changes affect exchange rates. As Figure 15-10 shows, the Fed raised interest rates from 1999 to 2001 faster than the ECB (the Fed was more worried about the U.S. economy "overheating" with higher inflation). In this period of global economic boom, the ECB's policy also tightened over time, as measured by changes in the Euro interest rate—the refinancing rate set by the ECB. But the changes were more restrained and slower in coming.

As Figure 15-10 also shows, the Fed then lowered interest rates aggressively from 2001 to 2004, with rates falling as low as  $ 1\% $  in 2003 to 2004 (the U.S. economy had slowed after the boom and the Fed hoped that lower interest rates would avert a recession; the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led to fears of a more serious economic setback and encouraged further monetary easing). The ECB also acted similarly to lower interest rates, but again the ECB did not move rates as far or as fast as the Fed.

As a result, the ECB's interest rate, previously lower than the Fed's rate, was soon higher than the U.S. rate in 2001 and remained higher through 2004. Investors most likely viewed these policy changes as a temporary shift in monetary policy in both countries. Hence, they might be considered as an example of temporary monetary policy shocks. Do our model's predictions accord well with reality?

Up until 2001, the policy of higher rates in the United States could be seen as a temporary home monetary contraction (relative to foreign), and our model would predict a dollar appreciation in the short run. After 2001 the aggressive reductions in U.S. interest rates could be seen as a temporary home monetary expansion (relative

U.S.-Eurozone Interest Rates and Exchange Rates, 1999-2004 From the euro's birth in 1999 until 2001, the dollar steadily appreciated against the euro, as interest rates in the United States were raised well above those in Europe. In early 2001, however, the Federal Reserve began a long series of interest rate reductions. By 2002 the Fed Funds rate was well below the ECB's refinancing rate. Theory predicts a dollar appreciation (1999-2001) when U.S. interest rates were relatively high, followed by a dollar depreciation (2001-2004) when U.S. interest rates were relatively low. Looking at the figure, you will see that this is what occurred.

to foreign), and our model predicts a dollar depreciation in the short run. Looking at the path of the dollar-euro exchange rate in the figure, we can see that the model accords well with reality.

# 4 a Complete Theory: Unifying the Monetary and Asset Approaches

In this section, we extend our analysis from the short run to the long run, and examine permanent as well as temporary shocks. To do this, we put together a complete theory of exchange rates that couples the long-run and short-run approaches, as shown schematically in Figure 15-11:

We need the asset approach (this chapter)—short-run money market equilibrium and uncovered interest parity:
$ $

\left. \begin{array}{l} \overline {{P}}_{U S} = M_{U S} / \left[ L_{U S} \left(i_{\S}\right) Y_{U S} \right] \\ \overline {{P}}_{E U R} = M_{E U R} / \left[ L_{E U R} \left(i_{\ell}\right) Y_{E U R} \right] \\ i_{\S} = i_{\ell} + \frac{E_{\S / \ell}^{e} - E_{\S / \ell}}{E_{\S / \ell}} \end{array} \right\} \text{Th ea ss et ap pr oa ch .} \tag {15-4}

$ $
- There are three equations and three unknowns (two short-run nominal interest rates and the spot exchange rate). The future expected exchange rate must be known, as must the current levels of money and real income. (The price level is also treated as given.)
- But to forecast the future expected exchange rate, we also need the long-run monetary approach from the previous chapter—a long-run monetary model and purchasing power parity:
$ $

\left. \begin{array}{l} P_{U S}^{e} = M_{U S}^{e} / \left[ L_{U S} \left(i_{\S}^{e}\right) Y_{U S}^{e} \right] \\ P_{E U R}^{e} = M_{E U R}^{e} / \left[ L_{E U R} \left(i_{\epsilon}^{e}\right) Y_{E U R}^{e} \right] \\ E_{\S / \epsilon}^{e} = P_{U S}^{e} / P_{E U R}^{e} \end{array} \right\} \quad \text{Th em on et ar ya pp ro ac h .} \tag {15-5}

$ $
- There are three equations and three unknowns (two price levels and the exchange rate). Note that all variables here have a superscript  $ e $  to denote future expected values or forecasts. We assume that forecasts of future money, real income, and nominal interest rates are known. This model can then be applied to obtain price forecasts and, hence, a forecast of the future expected exchange rate.<sup>2</sup>

Figure 15-11 sums up all the theory we have learned so far in the past two chapters. It shows how all the pieces fit together. In total we have six equations and six unknowns.

It is only now, with all the building blocks in place, that we can fully appreciate how the two key mechanisms of expectations and arbitrage operate in a variety of ways to determine exchange rates in both the short run and the long run. Ensure you are comfortable with all of the building blocks—how they work individually and how they connect.

After all our hard work, we have arrived at a complete theory to explain exchange rates in the short run and the long run. The model incorporates all of the key economic fundamentals that affect exchange rates and, in practice, although forex markets exhibit a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty, there is evidence that these fundamentals play a major role in shaping traders' decisions (see Side Bar: Confessions of a Forex Trader).

# Long-run Policy Analysis

When and how can we apply the complete model? The downside of working with the complete model is that we have to keep track of multiple mechanisms and variables; the upside is that the theory is fully developed and can be applied to short-run and long-run policy shocks.

The temporary shocks we saw in the last section represent only one kind of monetary policy change, one that does not affect the long-run nominal anchor. The fact that these shocks were temporary allowed us to conduct all of the analysis under

FIGURE 15-11

the assumption that the long-run expected level of the exchange rate remained unchanged.

When the monetary authorities decide to make a permanent change, however, this assumption of unchanged expectations is no longer appropriate. Under such a change, the authorities would cause an enduring change in all nominal variables; that is, they would be electing to change their nominal anchor policy in some way. Thus, when a monetary policy shock is permanent, the long-run expectation of the level of the exchange rate has to adjust. This change will, in turn, cause the exchange rate predictions of the short-run model to differ from those made when the policy shock was only temporary.

# Confessions of a Foreign Exchange Trader

Trying to forecast exchange rates is a major enterprise in financial markets and serves as the basis of any trading strategy. A tour of the industry would find many firms offering forecasting services at short, medium, and long horizons. Forecasts are generally based on three methodologies (or some mix of all three):

1. Economic fundamentals. Forecasts are based on ideas developed in the past two chapters. Exchange rates are determined by factors such as money, output, interest rates, and so on; hence, forecasters try to develop long- and short-range predictions of these "fundamental" variables. Example: "The exchange rate will depreciate because a looser monetary policy is expected."
2. Politics. Forecasts recognize that some factors that are not purely economic can affect exchange rates. One is the outbreak of war (see the application at the end of this chapter). Political crises might matter, too, if they affect perceptions of risk. Changes in risk interfere with simple interest parity and can move exchange rates. Making such forecasts is more qualitative and subjective, but it is still concerned with fundamental determinants in our theory. Example: "The exchange rate will depreciate because a conflict with a neighboring state raises the probability of war and inflation."
3. Technical methods. Forecasts rely on extrapolations from past behavior. Trends may be assumed to continue ("momentum"), or recent maximum and minimum values may be assumed to be binding. These trading strategies assume that financial markets exhibit some persistence and, if followed, may make such an assumption self-fulfilling for a time. Nonetheless, large crashes that return asset prices back to fundamental levels can burst such bubbles. Example: "The exchange rate has hit this level three times this year but never gone further; it will not go further this time."

A recent survey of U.K. forex traders provided some interesting insights into this world.* One-third described their trading as "technically based," and one-third said their trades were "fundamentals-based"; others were jobbing or trading for clients.

The survey revealed that insights from economic theory mattered little from one hour to the next. In the very short run, within the day, traders confessed that many factors unrelated to economic fundamentals affected exchange rates in the market:  $ 29\% $ cited "bandwagon effects," and $ 33\% $ mentioned "overreaction to news." Concerning within-day changes in exchange rates, when asked, "Do you believe exchange rate movements accurately reflect changes in the fundamental value," fully $ 97\% $ of the traders responded no and only $ 3\% $ yes. However, in the medium run, described as within six months, $ 58\% $ responded yes. And in the long run, described as more than six months, $ 87\% $  thought that changes reflected fundamentals.

Which economic fundamentals mattered? News about money supplies, interest rates, and GDP levels was quickly incorporated into trading, usually in less than a minute or even in a matter of seconds. All of these are key variables in our complete model. As we would expect, PPP was deemed irrelevant within the day, but  $ 16\% $ thought it mattered in the medium run, and $ 44\% $  in the long run. The lack of unanimity about PPP may reflect legitimate concerns about its shortcomings (which we examined in the previous chapter).

These insights guide our analysis of permanent policy shocks. They also tell us that we cannot approach such analysis chronologically. Before we can figure out what happens in the short run, we have to know expectations, that is, what is going to happen in the long run. Thus, we have to use a technique that is common in forward-looking economic problems: we must solve backward from the future to the present. (This ordering mirrors the presentation of the material in this textbook—we must understand the long run before we can understand the short run.)

A Permanent Shock to the Home Money Supply We start our analysis of the Home (U.S.) and Foreign (Europe) economies with each economy currently at a

long-run equilibrium in which all variables are steady. In this equilibrium, we assume that each country has a fixed real income, a fixed money supply, and a zero rate of inflation. Hence, there is a zero rate of depreciation because the equilibrium is characterized by purchasing power parity, and interest rates in each country are the same because the equilibrium is characterized by uncovered interest parity.

Our analysis is shown in Figure 15-12. Panels (a) and (b) show the short-run impacts of a permanent increase in the money supply in the home (U.S.) money and FX markets; panels (c) and (d) show the long-run impacts and the adjustment from the short run to the long run.

As shown in panels (a), (b), (c), and (d), we suppose the home economy starts with initial equilibria in the home money and FX markets shown by points 1 and  $ 1' $, respectively. In the money market, in panels (a) and (c), at point 1, the home money market is initially in equilibrium: $ MS_{1} $ corresponds to an initial real money supply of $ M_{US}^{1}/\overline{P}_{US}^{1} $; given real money demand $ MD $, the nominal interest rate is $ i_{\S}^{1} $. In the FX market, in panels (b) and (d), at point $ 1' $, the domestic return $ DR_{1} $ is the nominal interest rate $ i_{\S}^{1} $. Given the foreign return curve $ FR_{1} $, the equilibrium exchange rate is $ E_{\S/\epsilon}^{1} $. If both economies are at a long-run equilibrium with zero depreciation, then this is also the expected future exchange rate $ E_{\S/\epsilon}^{e1} = E_{\S/\epsilon}^{1} $ .

We now start to figure out what happens after the policy shock hits today, working backward from the future to the present.

The Long Run Refer to panels (c) and (d) of Figure 15-12. In the long run, we know from the monetary approach that an increase in the money supply will eventually lead to a proportionate increase in the price level and the exchange rate. If the money supply increases from  $ M_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} $ today, then the price level will eventually increase by the same proportion from $ P_{US}^{1} $ to $ P_{US}^{2} $, and, to maintain PPP, the exchange rate will eventually rise by the same proportion (and the dollar will depreciate) from $ E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{1} $ to its long-run level $ E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{4} $, in panel (d), where $ E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{4} / E_{\mathbb{S}/\epsilon}^{1} = P_{US}^{2} / P_{US}^{1} = M_{US}^{2} / M_{US}^{1} > 1 $ . (We use "4" to denote long-run exchange rate values because there will be some short-run responses to consider in just a moment.)

Thus, in the long run, in panel (c), if money and prices both rise in the same proportion, then the real money supply will be unchanged at its original level  $ M_{US}^{1} / P_{US}^{1} = M_{US}^{2} / P_{US}^{2} $, the real money supply curve will still be in its original position $ MS_{1} $ and the nominal interest rate will again be $ i_{\S}^{1} $ . In the long run, the money market returns to where it started: long-run equilibrium is at point 4 (which is the same as point 1).

In the FX market, however, a permanent money supply shock causes some permanent changes in the long run. One thing that does not change is the domestic return  $ DR_{1} $, since in the long run it returns to $ i_{\mathrm{S}}^{1} $. But the exchange rate will rise from the initial long-run exchange rate $ E_{\mathrm{S}/\epsilon}^{1} $, to a new long-run level $ E_{\mathrm{S}/\epsilon}^{4} $. Because $ E_{\mathrm{S}/\epsilon}^{4} $ is a long-run stable level, it is also the new expected level of the exchange rate $ E_{\mathrm{S}/\epsilon}^{4} $ that will prevail in the future. That is, the future will look like the present, under our assumptions, except that the exchange rate will be sitting at $ E_{\mathrm{S}/\epsilon}^{4} $ instead of $ E_{\mathrm{S}/\epsilon}^{1} $. What does this change do to the foreign return curve $ FR $ ? As we know, when the expected exchange rate increases, foreign returns are higher, so the $ FR $ curve shifts up, from $ FR_{1} $ to $ FR_{2} $. Because in the long run $ E_{\mathrm{S}/\epsilon}^{4} $ is the new stable equilibrium exchange rate, and $ i_{\mathrm{S}}^{1} $ is the interest rate, the new FX market equilibrium is at point $ 4' $ where $ FR_{2} $ intersects $ DR_{1} $ .

(b) Short Run: FX Market

Permanent Expansion of the Home Money Supply, Short-Run Impact: In panel (a), the home price level is fixed, but the supply of dollar balances increases and real money supply shifts out. To restore equilibrium at point 2, the interest rate falls from  $ i_{\frac{1}{2}}^{1} $ to $ i_{\frac{1}{2}}^{2} $. In panel (b), in the FX market, the home interest rate falls, so the domestic return decreases and $ DR $ shifts down. In addition, the permanent change in the home money supply implies a permanent, long-run depreciation of the dollar. Hence, there is also a permanent rise in $ E_{\frac{1}{2}/\epsilon}^{e} $, which causes a permanent increase in the foreign return $ i_{\epsilon} + (E_{\frac{1}{2}/\epsilon}^{e} - E_{\frac{1}{2}/\epsilon}) / E_{\frac{1}{2}/\epsilon} $, all else equal; $ FR $ shifts up from $ FR_{1} $ to $ FR_{2} $. The simultaneous fall in $ DR $ and rise in $ FR $ cause the home currency to depreciate steeply, leading to a new equilibrium at point $ 2' $ (and not at $ 3' $ , which would be the equilibrium if the policy were temporary).

(d) Long Run: FX Market

Long-Run Adjustment: In panel (c), in the long run, prices are flexible, so the home price level and the exchange rate both rise in proportion with the money supply. Prices rise to  $ P_{US}^{2} $, and real money supply returns to its original level $ M_{US}^{1} / P_{US}^{1} $. The money market gradually shifts back to equilibrium at point 4 (the same as point 1). In panel (d), in the FX market, the domestic return $ DR $, which equals the home interest rate, gradually shifts back to its original level. The foreign return curve $ FR $ does not move at all: there are no further changes in the foreign interest rate or in the future expected exchange rate. The FX market equilibrium shifts gradually to point $ 4' $. The exchange rate falls (and the dollar appreciates) from $ E_{\S/\epsilon}^{2} $ to $ E_{\S/\epsilon}^{4} $ . Arrows in both graphs show the path of gradual adjustment.

The Short Run Only now that we have changes in expectations worked out can we work back through panels (a) and (b) of Figure 15-12 to see what will happen in the short run.

Look first at the FX market in panel (b). Because expectations about the future exchange rate have changed with today's policy announcement, the FX market is affected immediately. Everyone knows that the exchange rate will be  $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^4 $ in the future. The foreign return curve shifts when the expected exchange rate changes; it rises from $ FR_1 $ to $ FR_2 $. This is the same shift we just saw in the long-run panel (d). The dollar is expected to depreciate to $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^4 $ (relative to $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^1 $ ) in the future, so euro deposits are more attractive today.

Now consider the impact of the change in monetary policy in the short run. Look at the money market in panel (a). In the short run, if the money supply increases from  $ M_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} $ but prices are sticky at $ P_{US}^{1} $, then real money balances rise from $ M_{US}^{1} / P_{US}^{1} $ to $ M_{US}^{2} / P_{US}^{1} $. The real money supply shifts from $ MS_{1} $ to $ MS_{2} $ and the home interest rate falls from $ i_{\mathrm{S}}^{1} $ to $ i_{\mathrm{S}}^{2} $ , leading to a new short-run money market equilibrium at point 2.

Now look back to the FX market in panel (b). If this were a temporary monetary policy shock, expectations would be unchanged, and the  $ FR_{1} $ curve would still describe foreign returns, but domestic returns would fall from $ DR_{1} $ to $ DR_{2} $ as the interest rate fell and the home currency would depreciate to the level $ E_{\mathrm{S /E}}^{3} $. The FX market equilibrium, after a temporary money supply shock, would be at point $ 3' $ , as we have seen before.

But this is not the case now. This time we are looking at a permanent shock to money supply. It has two effects on today's FX market. One impact of the money supply shock is to lower the home interest rate, decreasing domestic returns in today's FX market from  $ DR_{1} $ to $ DR_{2} $. The other impact of the money supply shock is to increase the future expected exchange rate, increasing foreign returns in today's FX market from $ FR_{1} $ to $ FR_{2} $. Hence, the FX market equilibrium in the short run is where $ DR_{2} $ and $ FR_{2} $ intersect, now at point $ 2' $, and the exchange rate depreciates all the way to $ E_{\mathrm{S /E}}^{2} $ .

Note that the short-run equilibrium level of the exchange rate  $ (E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{2}) $ is higher than the level that would be observed under a temporary shock $ (E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{3}) $ and also higher than the level that will be observed in the long run $ (E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}^{4}) $ . To sum up, in the short run, the permanent shock causes the exchange rate to depreciate more than it would under a temporary shock and more than it will end up depreciating in the long run.

Adjustment from Short Run to Long Run The arrows in panels (c) and (d) of Figure 15-12 trace what happens as we move from the short run to the long run. Prices that were initially sticky in the short run become unstuck. The price level rises from  $ P_{US}^{1} $ to $ P_{US}^{2} $, and this pushes the real money supply back to its initial level, from $ MS_{2} $ back to $ MS_{1} $. Money demand $ MD $ is unchanged. Hence, in the home money market of panel (c), the economy moves from the short-run equilibrium at point 2 to the long-run equilibrium, which is again at point 1, following the path shown by the arrows. Hence, the interest rate gradually rises from $ i_{\S}^{2} $ back to $ i_{\S}^{1} $. This raises the domestic returns over in the FX market of panel (d) from $ DR_{2} $ back to $ DR_{1} $. So the FX market moves from the short-run equilibrium at point $ 2' $ to the long-run equilibrium, which is again at point $ 4' $ .

An Example Let's make this very tricky experiment a bit more concrete with a numerical example. Suppose you are told that, all else equal, (i) the home money

supply permanently increases by  $ 5\% $ today; (ii) prices are sticky in the short run, so this also causes an increase in real money supply that lowers domestic interest rates by four percentage points from $ 6\% $ to $ 2\% $ ; (iii) prices will fully adjust in one year's time to today's monetary expansion and PPP will hold again. Based on this information, can you predict what will happen to prices and the exchange rate today and in a year's time?

Yes. Work backward from the long run to the short run, as before. In the long run, a  $ 5\% $ increase in $ M $ means a $ 5\% $ increase in $ P $ that will be achieved in one year. By PPP, this $ 5\% $ increase in $ P $ implies a $ 5\% $ rise in $ E $ (a $ 5\% $ depreciation in the dollar's value) over the same period. In other words, over the next year $ E $ will rise at $ 5\% $ per year, which will be the rate of depreciation. Finally, in the short run, UIP tells us what happens to the exchange rate today: to compensate investors for the four percentage point decrease in the domestic interest rate, arbitrage in the FX market requires that the value of the home currency be expected to appreciate at $ 4\% $ per year; that is, $ E $ must fall $ 4\% $ in the year ahead. However, if $ E $ has to fall $ 4\% $ in the next year and still end up $ 5\% $ above its level at the start of today, then it must jump up $ 9\% $  today: it overshoots its long-run level.

# Overshooting

Compared with the temporary expansion of money supply we studied before, the permanent shock has a much greater impact on the exchange rate in the short run.

Under the temporary shock, domestic returns go down; traders want to sell the dollar for one reason only—temporarily lower dollar interest rates make dollar deposits less attractive. Under the permanent shock, domestic returns go down and foreign returns go up; traders want to sell the dollar for two reasons—temporarily lower dollar interest rates and an expected dollar depreciation make dollar deposits much less attractive. In the short run, the interest rate and exchange rate effects combine to create an instantaneous "double whammy" for the dollar, which gives rise to a phenomenon that economists refer to as exchange rate overshooting.

To better visualize the overshooting phenomenon, we show in Figure 15-13 the time path over which the key economic variables change after the permanent shock we just studied using Figure 15-12. We see the following:

a. The nominal money supply is subject to a one-time increase at time  $ T $ .
b. Real money balances rise instantaneously but revert to their initial level in the long run; the nominal interest rate falls instantaneously but reverts to its initial level in the long run.
c. The price level is sticky in the short run but rises to a new higher level in the long run, increasing in the same proportion as the nominal money supply.
d. The exchange rate rises (depreciates) to a new higher level in the long run, rising in the same proportion as the nominal money supply. In the short run, however, the exchange rate rises even more, overshooting its long-run level, then gradually decreasing to its long-run level (which is still higher than the initial level).

The overshooting result adds yet another argument for the importance of a sound long-run nominal anchor: without it, exchange rates are likely to be more volatile,

Responses to a Permanent Expansion of the Home Money Supply In panel (a), there is a one-time permanent increase in home (U.S.) nominal money supply at time  $ T $ . In panel (b), prices are sticky in the short run, so there is a short-run increase in the real money supply and a fall in the home interest rate. In panel (c), in the long run, prices rise in the same proportion as the money supply. In panel (d), in the short run, the exchange rate overshoots its long-run value (the dollar depreciates by a large amount), but in the long run, the exchange rate will have risen only in proportion to changes in money and prices.

The wild fluctuations of exchange rates in the 1970s, at a time when exchange rate anchors were ripped loose, exposed these linkages with great clarity (see Side Bar: Overshooting in Practice). And new research provides evidence that the shift to a new form of anchoring, inflation targeting, might be helping to bring down exchange rate volatility in recent years.<sup>3</sup>

# Overshooting in Practice

Overshooting can happen in theory, but does it happen in the real world? The model tells us that if there is a tendency for monetary policy shocks to be more permanent than temporary, then there will be a tendency for the exchange rate to be more volatile. Thus, we might expect to see a serious increase in exchange rate volatility whenever a nominal anchoring system breaks down. Indeed, such conditions were seen in the 1970s, which is precisely when the overshooting phenomenon was discovered. How did this happen?

From the 1870s until the 1970s, except during major crises and wars, the world's major currencies were fixed against one another. Floating rates were considered anathema by policy makers and economists. Later in this book, we study the gold standard regime that began circa 1870 and fizzled out in the 1930s and the subsequent "dollar standard" of the 1950s and 1960s that was devised at a conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944. As we'll see, the Bretton Woods system did not survive for various reasons.

When floating rates reappeared in the 1970s, fears of instability returned. Concern mounted as floating exchange rates proved much more volatile than could be explained according to the prevailing flexible-price monetary approach: the models said that money supplies and real income were simply too

stable to be able to generate such large fluctuations (as seen in Figure 15-14). Some feared that this was a case of animal spirits, John Maynard Keynes's term for irrational forces, especially in asset markets like that for foreign exchange. The challenge to economists was to derive a new model that could account for the wild swings in exchange rates.

In 1976, economist Rudiger Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed such a model. Building on Keynesian foundations, Dornbusch showed that sticky prices and flexible exchange rates implied exchange rate overshooting. Dornbusch's seminal work was a rare case of a theory arriving at just the right time to help explain reality. In the 1970s, countries abandoned exchange rate anchors and groped for new ways to conduct monetary policy in a new economic environment. Policies varied and inflation rates grew, diverged, and persisted. Overshooting helps make sense of all this: if traders saw policies as having no well-defined anchor, monetary policy shocks might no longer be guaranteed to be temporary, so long-run expectations could swing wildly with every piece of news.

# 5 Fixed Exchange Rates and the Trilemma

We have developed a complete theory of exchange rates, based on the assumption that market forces in the money market and the foreign exchange market determine exchange rates. Our models have the most obvious application to the case of floating exchange rate regimes. But as we have seen, not every country floats. Can our theory also be applied to the equally important case of fixed exchange rate regimes and to other intermediate regimes? The answer is yes, and we conclude this chapter by adapting our existing theory for the case of fixed regimes.

# What is a Fixed Exchange Rate Regime?

To understand the crucial difference between fixing and floating, we contrast the polar cases of tight fixing (hard pegs including narrow bands) and free floating, and ignore, for now, intermediate regimes. We also set aside regimes that include controls on arbitrage (capital controls) because such extremes of government intervention render our theory superfluous. Instead, we focus on the case of a fixed rate regime without controls so that capital is mobile and arbitrage is free to operate in the foreign exchange market.

Here the government itself becomes an actor in the foreign exchange market and uses intervention in the market to influence the market rate. Exchange rate intervention takes the form of the central bank buying and selling foreign currency at a fixed price, thus holding the market exchange rate at a fixed level denoted  $ \overline{E} $ .

We can explore the implications of that policy in the short run and the long run using the familiar building blocks of our theory. To give a concrete flavor to these analyses, we replace the United States and the Eurozone (whose currencies float against each other) with an example of an actual fixed exchange rate regime. In this example, Foreign remains the Eurozone, but Home is now Denmark.

We examine the implications of Denmark's decision to peg its currency, the krone, to the euro at a fixed rate  $ \overline{E}_{DKr / \ell} $ .<sup>4</sup>

In the long run, fixing the exchange rate is one kind of nominal anchor. Yet even if it allowed the krone to float but had some nominal anchor, Denmark's monetary policy would still be constrained in the long run by the need to achieve its chosen nominal target. We have seen that any country with a nominal anchor faces long-run monetary policy constraints of some kind. What we now show is that a country with a fixed exchange rate faces monetary policy constraints not just in the long run but also in the short run.

# Pegging Sacrifices Monetary Policy Autonomy in the Short Run: Example

By assumption, equilibrium in the krone-euro forex market requires that the Danish interest rate be equal to the Eurozone interest rate plus the expected rate of depreciation of the krone. But under a peg, the expected rate of depreciation is zero.

Here uncovered interest parity reduces to the simple condition that the Danish central bank must set its interest rate equal to  $ i_{\epsilon} $, the rate set by the ECB: $ $

i_{DKr} = i_{\epsilon} + \underbrace{\frac{E^{e}_{DKr / \epsilon} - E_{DKr / \epsilon}}{E_{DKr / \epsilon}}}_{\text{Equalszerofora crediblefixedexchangerate}} = i_{\epsilon}

$ $
Denmark has lost control of its monetary policy: it cannot independently change its interest rate under a peg.

The same is true of money supply policy. Short-run equilibrium in Denmark's money market requires that money supply equal money demand, but once Denmark's interest rate is set equal to the Eurozone interest rate  $ i_{\epsilon} $, there is only one feasible level for money supply, as we see by imposing $ i_{\epsilon} $ as the Danish interest rate in money market equilibrium: $ $

M_{D E N} = \bar {P}_{D E N} L_{D E N} \left(i_{D K r}\right) Y_{D E N} = \bar {P}_{D E N} L_{D E N} \left(i_{\epsilon}\right) Y_{D E N}

$ $
The implications are striking. The final expression contains the euro interest rate (exogenous, as far as the Danes are concerned), the fixed price level (exogenous by assumption), and output (also exogenous by assumption). No variable in this expression is under the control of the Danish authorities in the short run, and this is the only level of the Danish money supply consistent with equilibrium in the money and forex markets at the pegged rate  $ \overline{E}_{DKr/\epsilon} $ . If the Danish central bank is to maintain the peg, then in the short run it must choose the level of money supply implied by the last equation.

What's going on? Arbitrage is the key force. For example, if the Danish central bank tried to supply more krone and lower interest rates, they would be foiled by arbitrage. Danes would want to sell krone deposits and buy higher-yield euro deposits, applying downward pressure on the krone. To maintain the peg, whatever krone the Danish central bank had tried to pump into circulation, it would promptly have to buy them back in the foreign exchange market.

Thus, our short-run theory still applies, but with a different chain of causality:

Under a float, the home monetary authorities pick the money supply  $ M $. In the short run, the choice of $ M $ determines the interest rate $ i $ in the money market; in turn, via UIP, the level of $ i $ determines the exchange rate $ E $ . The money supply is an input in the model (an exogenous variable), and the exchange rate is an output of the model (an endogenous variable).
Under a fix, this logic is reversed. Home monetary authorities pick the fixed level of the exchange rate  $ E $. In the short run, a fixed $ E $ pins down the home interest rate $ i $ via UIP (forcing $ i $ to equal the foreign interest rate $ i^* $); in turn, the level of $ i $ determines the level of the money supply $ M $  necessary to meet money demand. The exchange rate is an input in the model (an exogenous variable), and the money supply is an output of the model (an endogenous variable).

This reversal of short-run causality is shown in a new schematic in the top part of Figure 15-15.

FIGURE 15-15

A Complete Theory of Fixed Exchange Rates: Same Building Blocks, Different Known and Unknown Variables Unlike in Figure 15-10, the home country is now assumed to fix its exchange rate with the foreign country. Inputs to the model are known exogenous variables (in green boxes). Outputs of the model are unknown endogenous variables (in red boxes). The levels of real income and the fixed exchange rate determine the home money supply levels, given outcomes in the foreign country.

# Pegging Sacrifices Monetary Policy Autonomy in the Long Run: Example

As we have noted, choosing a nominal anchor implies a loss of long-run monetary policy autonomy. Let's quickly see how that works when the anchor is a fixed exchange rate.

Following our discussion of the standard monetary model, we must first ask what the nominal interest rate is going to be in Denmark in the long run. But we have

already answered that question; it is going to be tied down the same way as in the short run, at the level set by the ECB, namely  $ i_{\epsilon} $. We might question, in turn, where that level $ i_{\epsilon} $ comes from (the answer is that it will be related to the "neutral" level of the nominal interest rate consistent with the ECB's own nominal anchor, its inflation target for the Eurozone). But that is beside the point: all that matters is that $ i_{\epsilon} $  is as much out of Denmark's control in the long run as it is in the short run.

Next we turn to the price level in Denmark, which is determined in the long run by PPP. But if the exchange rate is pegged, we can write long-run PPP for Denmark as
$ $

P_{D E N} = \bar {E}_{D K r / \epsilon} P_{E U R}

$ $
Here we encounter another variable that is totally outside of Danish control in the long run. Under PPP, pegging to the euro means that the Danish price level is a fixed multiple of the Eurozone price level (which is exogenous, as far as the Danes are concerned).

With the long-run nominal interest and price level outside of Danish control, we can show, as before, that monetary policy autonomy is out of the question. We just substitute  $ i_{DKr} = i_{\epsilon} $ and $ P_{DEN} = \overline{E}_{DKr / \epsilon}P_{EUR} $ into Denmark's long-run money market equilibrium to obtain $ $

M_{D E N} = P_{D E N} L_{D E N} \left(i_{D K r}\right) Y_{D E N} = \overline {{E}}_{D K r / \epsilon} P_{E U R} L_{D E N} \left(i_{\epsilon}\right) Y_{D E N}

$ $
The final expression contains the long-run euro interest rate and price levels (exogenous, as far as the Danes are concerned), the fixed exchange rate level (exogenous by assumption), and long-run Danish output (also exogenous by assumption). Again, no variable in the final expression is under the control of the Danish authorities in the long run, and this is the only level of the Danish money supply consistent with equilibrium in the money and foreign exchange market at the pegged rate of  $ \overline{E}_{DKr / \ell} $ .

Thus, our long-run theory still applies, just with a different chain of causality:

Under a float, the home monetary authorities pick the money supply  $ M $. In the long run, the growth rate of $ M $ determines the interest rate $ i $ via the Fisher effect and also the price level $ P $; in turn, via PPP, the level of $ P $ determines the exchange rate $ E $ . The money supply is an input in the model (an exogenous variable), and the exchange rate is an output of the model (an endogenous variable).
Under a fix, this logic is reversed. Home monetary authorities pick the exchange rate  $ E $. In the long run, the choice of $ E $ determines the price level $ P $ via PPP, and also the interest rate $ i $ via UIP; these, in turn, determine the necessary level of the money supply $ M $ . The exchange rate is an input in the model (an exogenous variable), and the money supply is an output of the model (an endogenous variable).

This reversal of long-run causality is also shown in the new schematic in the bottom part of Figure 15-15.

# The Trilemma

Our findings lead to the conclusion that policy makers face some tough choices. Not all desirable policy goals can be simultaneously met. These constraints are summed up in one of the most important principles in open-economy macroeconomics.

Consider the following three equations and parallel statements about desirable policy goals. For illustration we return to the Denmark-Eurozone example:

<table><tr><td>1. EeDKr/ε - EDKr/ε / EDKr/ε = 0</td><td>A fixed exchange rate
■ May be desired as a means to promote stability in trade and investment
■ Represented here by zero expected depreciation</td></tr><tr><td>2. iDKr = iε + EeDKr/ε - EDKr/ε / EDKr/ε</td><td>International capital mobility
■ May be desired as a means to promote integration, efficiency, and risk sharing
■ Represented here by uncovered interest parity, which results from arbitrage</td></tr><tr><td>3. iDKr ≠ iε</td><td>Monetary policy autonomy
■ May be desired as a means to manage the home economy&#x27;s business cycle
■ Represented here by the ability to set the home interest rate independently of the foreign interest rate</td></tr></table>

For a variety of reasons, as noted, governments may want to pursue all three of these policy goals. But they can't: formulae 1, 2, and 3 show that it is a mathematical impossibility as shown by the following statements:

1 and 2 imply not 3 (1 and 2 imply interest equality, contradicting 3).
2 and 3 imply not 1 (2 and 3 imply an expected change in  $ E $ , contradicting 1).
3 and 1 imply not 2 (3 and 1 imply a difference between domestic and foreign returns, contradicting 2).

This result, known as the trilemma, is one of the most important ideas in international macroeconomics. It tells us that the three policy goals just outlined are mutually incompatible: you cannot have all three at once. You must choose to drop one of the three (or, equivalently, you must adopt one of three pairs: 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 1). Sadly, there is a long history of macroeconomic disasters stemming from the failure of some policy that ignored this fundamental lesson.

The trilemma can be illustrated graphically as in Figure 15-16. Each corner of the triangle represents a viable policy regime choice. For each corner, the label on the opposite edge of the triangle indicates the goal that has been sacrificed, while the labels on the two adjacent edges show the two goals that can be attained under that choice (see Side Bar: Intermediate Regimes).

# Figure 15-16

The Trilemma Each corner of the triangle represents a viable policy choice. The labels on the two adjacent edges of the triangle are the goals that can be attained; the label on the opposite edge is the goal that has to be sacrificed.

# Side Bar

# Intermediate Regimes

The lessons of the trilemma most clearly apply when the policies are at the ends of a spectrum: a hard peg or a float, perfect capital mobility or immobility, complete autonomy or none at all. But sometimes a country may not be fully in one of the three corners: the rigidity of the peg, the degree of capital mobility, and the independence of monetary policy could be partial rather than full.

For example, in a band arrangement, the exchange rate is maintained within a range of  $ \pm X\% $ of some central rate. The significance of the band is that some expected depreciation (i.e., a little bit of floating) is possible. As a result, a limited interest differential can open up between the two countries. For example, suppose the band is $ 2\% $ wide (i.e., $ \pm 1\% $ around a central rate). To compute home interest rates, UIP tells us that we must add the foreign interest rate (let's suppose it is $ 5\% $) to the expected rate of depreciation (which is $ \pm 2\% $ if the exchange rate moves from one band edge to the other). Thus, Home may "fix" this way and still have the freedom to set 12-month interest rates in the range between $ 3\% $ and $ 7\% $ . But the home country cannot evade the trilemma forever: on average, over time, the rate of depreciation will have to be zero to keep the exchange rate within the narrow band, meaning that the home interest rate must track the foreign interest rate apart from small deviations.

Similar qualifications to the trilemma could result from partial capital mobility, in which barriers to arbitrage could also lead to interest differentials. And with such differentials emerging, the desire for partial monetary autonomy can be accommodated.

In practice, once these distinctions are understood, it is usually possible to make some kind of judgment about which corner best describes the country's policy choice. For example, in 2007 both Slovakia and Denmark were supposedly pegged to the euro as members of the EU's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). But the similarities ended there. The Danish krone was operating in ERM bands of official width  $ \pm 2.25\% $, but closer to $ \pm 0.5\% $ in practice, a pretty hard peg with almost no movement. The Slovak koruna was operating with $ \pm 15\% $ bands and at one point even shifted that band by appreciating its central rate by $ 8.5\% $  in March 2007. With its perpetual narrow band, Denmark's regime was clearly fixed. With its wide and adjustable bands, Slovakia's regime was closer to managed floating.\*

# Application

# The Trilemma in Europe

We motivated the trilemma with the case of Denmark, which has chosen policy goals 1 and 2. As a member of the European Union (EU), Denmark adheres to the single-market legislation that requires free movement of capital within the bloc. It also unilaterally pegs its krone to the euro under the EU's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), an arrangement that ostensibly serves as a stepping-stone to Eurozone membership. Consequently, UIP predicts that the Danish central bank must set an interest rate at the same level as that set by the ECB; it has lost option 3.

The Danes could make one of two politically difficult choices if they wished to gain monetary independence from the ECB: they could abandon their commitment to the EU treaties on capital mobility (drop 2 to get 3), which is extremely unlikely, or they could abandon their ERM commitment and let the krone float against the euro (drop 1 to get 3), which is also fairly unlikely. Floating is, however, the choice of the United Kingdom, an EU country that has withdrawn from the ERM and that allows the pound to float against the euro.

Figure 15-17 shows evidence for the trilemma. Since 1999 the United Kingdom has had the ability to set interest rates independently of the ECB. But Denmark has

FIGURE 15-17

The Trilemma in Europe The figure shows selected central banks' base interest rates for the period 1994 to 2012 with reference to the German mark and euro base rates. In this period, the British made a policy choice to float against the German mark and (after 1999) against the euro. This permitted monetary independence because interest rates set by the Bank of England could diverge from those set in Frankfurt. No such independence in policy making was afforded by the Danish decision to peg the krone first to the mark and then to the euro. Since 1999 the Danish interest rate has moved almost exactly in line with the ECB rate. Similar forces operated pre-1999 for other countries pegging to the mark, such as the Netherlands and Austria. Until they joined the Eurozone in 1999, their interest rates, like that of Denmark, closely tracked the German rate.

not: since 1999 the Danish interest rate has tracked the ECB's rate almost exactly. (Most of the departures from equality reflect uncertainty about the euro project and Denmark's peg at two key moments: at the very start of the euro project in 1999, and during the credibility crisis of the Eurozone since the crisis of 2008.)

These monetary policy ties to Frankfurt even predate the euro itself. Before 1999 Denmark, and some countries such as Austria and the Netherlands, pegged to the German mark with the same result: their interest rates had to track the German interest rate, but the U.K. interest rate did not. The big difference is that Austria and the Netherlands have formally abolished their national currencies, the schilling and the guilder, and have adopted the euro—an extreme and explicit renunciation of monetary independence. Meanwhile, the Danish krone lives on, showing that a national currency can suggest monetary sovereignty in theory but may deliver nothing of the sort in practice.

# 6 Conclusions

In this chapter, we drew together everything we have learned so far about exchange rates. We built on the concepts of arbitrage and equilibrium in the foreign exchange market in the short run, taking expectations as given and applying uncovered interest parity. We also relied on the purchasing power parity theory as a guide to exchange rate determination in the long run. Putting together all these building blocks provides a complete and internally consistent theory of exchange rate determination.

Exchange rates are an interesting topic in and of themselves, but at the end of the day, we also care about what they mean for the wider economy, how they relate to macroeconomic performance, and the part they play in the global monetary system. That is our goal in the next chapters in which we apply our exchange rate theories in a wider framework to help us understand how exchange rates function in the national and international economy.

The theory we've developed in the past three chapters is the first tool that economists and policy makers pick up when studying a problem involving exchange rates. This theory has served well in rich and poor countries, whether in periods of economic stability or turbulence. Remarkably, it has even been applied in wartime, and to round off our discussion of exchange rates, we examine some colorful applications of the theory from conflicts past and present.

# Application

# News and the Foreign Exchange Market in Wartime

Our theory of exchange rates places expectations at center stage, but demonstrating the effect of changing expectations empirically is a challenge. However, wars dramatically expose the power of expectations to change exchange rates. War raises the risk that a currency may depreciate in value rapidly in the future, possibly all the way to zero. For one thing, the government may need to print money to finance its war effort, but how much inflation this practice will generate may be unclear. In addition, there is a risk of defeat and a decision by the victor to impose new economic arrangements such as a new currency; the existing currency may then be converted into the

new currency at a rate dictated by the victors or, in a worst-case scenario, it may be declared totally worthless, that is, not legal tender. Demand for the currency will then collapse to nothing and so will its value. Investors in the foreign exchange market are continually updating their forecasts about a war's possible outcomes, and, as a result, the path of an exchange rate during wartime usually reveals a clear influence of the effects of news.

The U.S. Civil War, 1861-1865 For four years, beginning April 12, 1861, a war raged between Union (Northern) and Confederate (Southern) forces. An important economic dimension of this conflict was the decision by the Confederate states to issue their own currency, the Confederate dollar, to help gain economic autonomy from the North and finance their war effort. The exchange rate of the Confederate dollar against the U.S. dollar is shown in Figure 15-18.

How should we interpret these data? The two currencies differed in one important respect. If the South had won, and the Confederate states had gained independence, they would have kept their Confederate dollar, and the Northern United States would have kept their U.S. dollar, too. Instead, the South was defeated, and, as expected in these circumstances, the U.S. dollar was imposed as the sole currency of the unified country; the Confederate dollar, like all liabilities of the Confederate nation, was repudiated by the victors and, hence, became worthless.

Confederate dollar fluctuated against the U.S. dollar and is shown on a logarithmic scale. Against the backdrop of a steady trend, victories and advances by the North (N) were generally associated with faster depreciation of the Confederate currency, whereas major Southern successes (S) usually led to a stronger Confederate currency.

Sources: Wesley C. Mitchell, 1908, Gold, Prices, and Wages under the Greenback Standard (Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press), Table 2; George T. McCandless Jr., 1996, "Money, Expectations, and U.S. Civil War," American Economic Review, 86(3), 661-671.

War news regularly influenced the exchange rate. As the South headed for defeat, the value of the Confederate dollar shrank. The overall trend was driven partly by inflationary war finance and partly by the probability of defeat. Major Northern victories marked "N" tended to coincide with depreciations of the Confederate dollar. Major Southern victories marked "S" were associated with appreciations or, at least, a slower depreciation. The key Union victory at Gettysburg, July 1-3, 1863, and the near simultaneous fall of Vicksburg on July 4 were followed by a dramatic depreciation of the Confederate dollar. By contrast, Southern victories (in the winter of 1862 to 1863 and the spring of 1864) were periods when the Southern currency held steady or even appreciated. But by the fall of 1864, and particularly after Sherman's March, the writing was on the wall, and the Confederate dollar began its final decline.

Currency traders in New York did good business either way. They were known to whistle "John Brown's Body" after a Union victory and "Dixie" after Confederate success, making profits as they traded dollars for gold and vice versa. Abraham Lincoln was not impressed, declaring, "What do you think of those fellows in Wall Street, who are gambling in gold at such a time as this? . . . For my part, I wish every one of them had his devilish head shot off."

The Iraq War, 2002-2003 The Civil War is not the only example of such phenomena. In 2003 Iraq was invaded by a U.S.-led coalition of forces intent on overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein, and the effects of war on currencies were again visible.<sup>7</sup>

Our analysis of this case is made a little more complicated by the fact that at the time of the invasion there were two currencies in Iraq. Indeed, some might say there were two Iraqs. Following a 1991 war, Iraq had been divided: in the North, a de facto Kurdish government was protected by a no-fly zone enforced by the Royal Air Force and U.S. Air Force; in the South, Saddam's regime continued. The two regions developed into two distinct economies, and each had its own currency. In the North, Iraqi dinar notes called "Swiss" dinars circulated.[8] In the South, a new currency, the "Saddam" or "print" dinar, was introduced.[9]

Figure 15-19 shows the close correlation between wartime news and exchange rate movements for this modern episode. We can compare exchange rate movements with well-known events, but panel (a) allows another interesting comparison. In 2002 a company called TradeSports Exchange allowed bets on Saddam's destiny by setting up

<sup>6</sup> This correlation was noted by Wesley Mitchell in 1903, (A History of the Greensbacks; Chicago: University of Chicago Press). For recent econometric studies that examine this phenomenon, see George T. McCandless, Jr., 1996, "Money, Expectations, and U.S. Civil War," *American Economic Review*, 86(3), 661-671; and Kristen L. Willard, Timothy W. Guinnane, and Harvey S. Rosen, 1996, "Turning Points in the Civil War: Views from the Greenback Market," *American Economic Review*, 86(4), 1001-1018.

<sup>8</sup> The notes were printed in Britain using plates of Swiss manufacture. The Kurds issued no new notes of their own; indeed, they had no means to do so and simply used this legacy currency after 1991. No new Swiss dinars were issued after 1989 in the South either.
<sup>9</sup> Once economic sanctions were imposed after the 1991 war, Baghdad had no access to the high-security technology and papers used to make modern banknotes. Instead, the Swiss dinar was retired, and the Saddam regime issued new legal tender notes in a form that it could print by using low-technology offset litho techniques that your local printer might use. These were the so-called Saddam or print dinars. Circulation of these notes exploded: a large volume of notes were printed by the Iraqi Central Bank and counterfeit added to this number. For these reasons, the northern currency, the Swiss dinar, was much more stable in the 1990s than the Saddam dinar.

(b) Exchange Rates for the Kurdish Region

Exchange Rates and News in the Iraq War As regime change looked more likely from 2002 to 2003, as reflected in panel (a), the Swiss dollar, the currency used by the Kurds, appreciated against the U.S. dollar and the Saddam dollar, the currency used in the south, as shown in panel (b). When the U.S. invasion ended, the difficult postwar transition began. Insurgencies and the failure to find Saddam Hussein became a cause for concern, as reflected in panel (a). The Swiss dollar depreciated against the dollar until December 2003, as shown in panel (b).

Notes: Panel (a) shows two contract prices: the value in cents of a TradeSports contract that paid 100¢ if Saddam were deposed by the end of June 2003 and 0 otherwise, and the value in cents of a contract that paid 100¢ if Saddam were captured by the end of December 2003 and 0 otherwise.

a market in contracts that paid \(1 if he was deposed by a certain date, and the prices of these contracts are shown using the left scale. After he was deposed, contracts that paid out upon his capture were traded, and these are also shown. If such a contract had a price of, say, \(80\text{¢}\), then this implied that "the market" believed the probability of overthrow or apprehension was \(80\%\).

In panel (b), we see the exchange rates of the Swiss dinar against the U.S. dollar and the Saddam dinar from 2002 to 2003. The Kurds' Swiss dinar-U.S. dollar rate had held at 18 per U.S. dollar for several years but steadily appreciated in 2002 and 2003 as the prospect of a war to depose Saddam became more likely. By May 2003, when the invasion phase of the war ended and Saddam had been deposed, it had appreciated as far as 6 to the dollar. The war clearly drove this trend: the more likely the removal of Saddam, the more durable would be Kurdish autonomy, and the more likely it was that a postwar currency would be created that respected the value of the Kurds' Swiss dinars. Notice how the rise in the value of the Swiss dinar tracked the odds of regime change until mid-2003.

After Baghdad fell, the coalition sought to capture Saddam, who had gone into hiding. As the hunt wore on, and a militant/terrorist insurgency began, fears mounted that he would never be found and his regime might survive underground and reappear. The odds on capture fell, and, moving in parallel, so did the value of the Swiss dinar. The Kurds now faced a rising probability that the whole affair would end badly for them and their currency. (However, when Saddam Hussein was captured on December 14, 2003, the Swiss dinar appreciated again.)

We can also track related movements in the Swiss dinar against the Saddam or print dinar. Before and during the war, while the Swiss dinar was appreciating against the U.S. dollar, it was also appreciating against the Saddam dinar. It strengthened from around 10 Swiss dinars per 1,000 Saddam dinars in early 2002 to about 3 Swiss dinars per 1,000 Saddam dinars in mid-2003. Then, as the postwar operations dragged on, this trend was reversed. By late 2003, the market rate was about 6 Swiss dinars per 1,000 Saddam dinars. Again, we can see how the Kurds' fortunes appeared to the market to rise and fall.

What became of all these dinars? Iraqis fared better than the holders of Confederate dollars. A new dinar was created under a currency reform announced in July 2003 and implemented from October 15, 2003, to January 15, 2004.[10] Exchange rate expectations soon moved into line with the increasingly credible official conversion rates and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the new dinar.

# Key Points

1. Our theory of exchange rates builds on two ideas: arbitrage and expectations. First, we developed the theory for the case of floating exchange rates.
2. In the short run, we assume prices are sticky and the asset approach to exchange rates is valid. Interest-bearing accounts in different currencies may offer different rates of nominal interest. Currencies may be expected to depreciate or appreciate against one another. There is an incentive for arbitrage: investors will shift funds from one country to another until the expected rate of return (measured in a common currency) is equalized. Arbitrage in the foreign exchange (forex, or FX) market determines today's spot exchange rate, and the forex market is in equilibrium when the uncovered interest parity condition holds. To apply the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition, however, we need a forecast of the expected exchange rate in the long run.
3. In the long run, we assume prices are flexible and the monetary approach to exchange rates is valid. This approach states that in the long run, purchasing power parity (PPP) holds so that the exchange rate must equal the ratio of the price levels in the two countries. Each price level, in turn, depends on the ratio of money supply to money demand in each country. The monetary approach can be used to forecast the long-run

future expected exchange rate, which, in turn, feeds back into short-run exchange rate determination via the UIP equation.

4. Putting together all of these ingredients yields a complete theory of how exchange rates are determined in the short run and the long run.
5. This model can be used to analyze the impact of changes to monetary policy, as well as other shocks to the economy.
6. A temporary home monetary expansion causes home interest rates to fall and the home exchange rate to depreciate. This temporary policy can be consistent with a nominal anchor in the long run.
7. A permanent home monetary expansion causes home interest rates to fall and the home exchange rate to depreciate and, in the short run, overshoot what will eventually be its long-run level. This permanent policy is inconsistent with a nominal anchor in the long run.
8. The case of fixed exchange rates can also be studied using this theory. Under capital mobility, interest parity becomes very simple. In this case, the home interest rate equals the foreign interest rate. Home monetary policy loses all autonomy compared with the floating case. The only way to recover it is to impose capital controls. This is the essence of the trilemma.

# Problems

1. Use the money market and FX diagrams to answer the following questions about the relationship between the British pound (£) and the U.S. dollar (\(). The exchange rate is in U.S. dollars per British pound \(E_{\mathrm{S}/\mathrm{£}}\). We want to consider how a change in the U.S. money supply affects interest rates and exchange rates. On all graphs, label the initial equilibrium point \(A\).
a. Illustrate how a temporary decrease in the U.S. money supply affects the money and FX markets. Label your short-run equilibrium point  $ B $ and your long-run equilibrium point $ C $ .
b. Using your diagram from (a), state how each of the following variables changes in the short run (increase/decrease/no change): U.S. interest rate, British interest rate,  $ E_{\mathrm{S}/\mathrm{E}} $, $ E_{\mathrm{S}/\mathrm{E}}^e $, and the U.S. price level $ P $ .
c. Using your diagram from (a), state how each of the following variables changes in the long run (increase/decrease/no change relative to their initial values at point  $ A $): U.S. interest rate, British interest rate, $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}} $, $ E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}^e $, and U.S. price level $ P $ .
2. Use the money market and FX diagrams to answer the following questions. This question considers the relationship between the Indian rupee (Rs) and the U.S. dollar (\$. The exchange rate is in rupees per dollar,  $ E_{\mathrm{Rs / \Phi}} $.On all graphs, label the initial equilibrium point $ A $ a. Illustrate how a permanent increase in India's money supply affects the money and FX markets. Label your short-run equilibrium point $ B $ and your long-run equilibrium point $ C $. b. By plotting them on a chart with time on the horizontal axis, illustrate how each of the following variables changes over time (for India): nominal money supply $ M_{IN} $, price level $ P_{IN} $, real money supply $ M_{IN} / P_{IN} $, interest rate $ i_{\mathrm{Rs}} $, and the exchange rate $ E_{\mathrm{Rs}/\mathbb{S}} $. c. Using your previous analysis, state how each of the following variables changes in the short run (increase/decrease/no change): India's interest rate $ i_{\mathrm{Rs}} $, $ E_{\mathrm{Rs}/\mathbb{S}} $, expected exchange rate $ E_{\mathrm{Rs}/\mathbb{S}}^e $, and price level $ P_{IN} $ .

d. Using your previous analysis, state how each of the following variables changes in the long run (increase/decrease/no change relative to their initial values at point  $ A $): India's interest rate $ i_{\mathrm{Rs}} $, $ E_{\mathrm{Rs}/\mathbb{S}} $, $ E_{\mathrm{Rs}/\mathbb{S}}^e $, and India's price level $ P_{IN} $ .
e. Explain how overshooting applies to this situation.
3. Is overshooting (in theory and in practice) consistent with purchasing power parity? Consider the reasons for the usefulness of PPP in the short run versus the long run and the assumption we've used in the asset approach (in the short run versus the long run). How does overshooting help to resolve the empirical behavior of exchange rates in the short run versus the long run?
4. Use the money market and FX diagrams to answer the following questions. This question considers the relationship between the euro (€) and the U.S. dollar (\$. The exchange rate is in U.S. dollars per euro,  $ E_{\S/\epsilon} $. Suppose that with financial innovation in the United States, real money demand in the United States decreases. On all graphs, label the initial equilibrium point $ A $ .
a. Assume this change in U.S. real money demand is temporary. Using the FX/money market diagrams, illustrate how this change affects the money and FX markets. Label your short-run equilibrium point  $ B $ and your long-run equilibrium point $ C $ .
b. Assume this change in U.S. real money demand is permanent. Using a new diagram, illustrate how this change affects the money and FX markets. Label your short-run equilibrium point  $ B $ and your long-run equilibrium point $ C $ .
c. Illustrate how each of the following variables changes over time in response to a permanent reduction in real money demand: nominal money supply  $ M_{US} $, price level $ P_{US} $, real money supply $ M_{US}/P_{US} $, U.S. interest rate $ i_{\S} $, and the exchange rate $ E_{\S/\epsilon} $ .

5. This question considers how the FX market will respond to changes in monetary policy in South Korea. For these questions, define the exchange rate as South Korean won per Japanese yen,  $ E_{\mathrm{won / \Psi}} $. Use the FX and money market diagrams to answer the following questions. On all graphs, label the initial equilibrium point $ A $ .

a. Suppose the Bank of Korea permanently decreases its money supply. Illustrate the short-run (label equilibrium point  $ B $) and long-run effects (label equilibrium point $ C $ ) of this policy.
b. Now, suppose the Bank of Korea announces it plans to permanently decrease its money supply but doesn't actually implement this policy. How will this affect the FX market in the short run if investors believe the Bank of Korea's announcement?
c. Finally, suppose the Bank of Korea permanently decreases its money supply, but this change is not anticipated. When the Bank of Korea implements this policy, how will this affect the FX market in the short run?
d. Using your previous answers, evaluate the following statements:

- If a country wants to increase the value of its currency, it can do so (temporarily) without raising domestic interest rates.
- The central bank can reduce both the domestic price level and value of its currency in the long run.
- The most effective way to increase the value of a currency is through surprising investors.

6. In the late 1990s, several East Asian countries used limited flexibility or currency pegs in managing their exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. This question considers how different countries responded to the East Asian currency crisis (1997-1998). For the following questions, treat the East Asian country as the home country and the United States as the foreign country. Also, for the diagrams, you may assume these countries maintained a currency peg (fixed rate) relative to the U.S. dollar. Also, for the following questions, you need consider only the short-run effects.

a. In July 1997, investors expected that the Thai baht would depreciate. That is, they expected that Thailand's central bank would be unable to maintain the currency peg with the U.S. dollar. Illustrate how this change in investors' expectations affects the Thai money market and FX market, with the exchange rate defined as baht (B) per U.S. dollar, denoted  $ E_{\mathrm{B} / \mathrm{S}} $ . Assume the Thai central bank wants to maintain capital mobility and preserve the level of its interest rate, and abandons the currency peg in favor of a floating exchange rate regime.
b. Indonesia faced the same constraints as Thailand—investors feared Indonesia would be forced to abandon its currency peg. Illustrate how this change in investors' expectations affects the Indonesian money market and FX market, with the exchange rate defined as rupiahs (Rp) per U.S. dollar, denoted  $ E_{\mathrm{Rp}/\mathbb{S}} $ . Assume that the Indonesian central bank wants to maintain capital mobility and the currency peg.
c. Malaysia had a similar experience, except that it used capital controls to maintain its currency peg and preserve the level of its interest rate. Illustrate how this change in investors' expectations affects the Malaysian money market and FX market, with the exchange rate defined as ringgit (RM) per U.S. dollar, denoted  $ E_{\mathrm{RM}/\mathbb{S}} $ . You need show only the short-run effects of this change in investors' expectations.
d. Compare and contrast the three approaches just outlined. As a policy maker, which would you favor? Explain.
Several countries have opted to join currency unions. Examples include those in the Euro area, the CFA franc union in West Africa, and the Caribbean currency union. This involves sacrificing the domestic currency in favor of using a single currency unit in multiple countries. Assuming that once a country joins a currency union, it will not leave, do these countries face the policy trilemma discussed in the text? Explain.
During the Great Depression, the United States remained on the international gold standard longer than other countries. This

effectively meant that the United States was committed to maintaining a fixed exchange rate at the onset of the Great Depression. The U.S. dollar was pegged to the value of gold, along with other major currencies, including the British pound, French franc, and so on. Many researchers have blamed the severity of the Great Depression on the Federal Reserve and its failure to react to economic conditions in 1929 and 1930. Discuss how the policy tri-lemma applies to this situation.

9. On June 20, 2007, John Authors, investment editor of the Financial Times, wrote the following in his column "The Short View":

The Bank of England published minutes showing that only the narrowest possible margin, 5-4, voted down [an interest] rate hike last month. Nobody foresaw this. . . The news took sterling back above \$ 1.99, and to a 15-year high against the yen.

Can you explain the logic of this statement? Interest rates in the United Kingdom had remained unchanged in the weeks since the

vote and were still unchanged after the minutes were released. What news was contained in the minutes that caused traders to react? Explain using the asset approach.

10. We can use the asset approach to both make predictions about how the market will react to current events and understand how important these events are to investors. Consider the behavior of the Union/Confederate exchange rate during the Civil War. How would each of the following events affect the exchange rate, defined as Confederate dollars per Union dollar,  $ E_{\mathrm{CS}/\mathrm{S}} $ ?

a. The Confederacy increases the money supply by  $ 2,900\% $  between July and December 1861.
b. The Union Army suffers a defeat in Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863.
c. The Confederate Army suffers a major defeat with Sherman's March in the autumn of 1864.
