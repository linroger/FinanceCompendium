# Exchange Rate Crises: How Pegs Work and How They Break

Global capital markets pose the same kinds of problems that jet planes do. They are faster, more comfortable, and they get you where you are going better. But the crashes are much more spectacular.

Lawrence Summers, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, 1999

Either extreme: a fixed exchange rate through a currency board, but no central bank, or a central bank plus truly floating exchange rates; either of those is a tenable arrangement. But a pegged exchange rate with a central bank is a recipe for trouble.

Milton Friedman, Nobel laureate, 1998

In the last chapter, we treated the question "fixed or floating?" as a one-time problem of exchange rate regime choice and assumed that, once the choice was made, the chosen regime would be stable and sustainable.

Unfortunately, the reality is different. The typical fixed exchange rate succeeds for a few years, only to break. A recent study found that the average duration of any peg was about five years, and the median duration was only two years. When the break occurs, there is often a large, sudden depreciation accompanied by high economic and political costs. Such a collapse is known as an exchange rate crisis. When a country shifts from floating to fixed it is generally smooth and planned, but when a country shifts from fixed to floating it is typically unplanned and catastrophic.

Despite the fragility exposed by recurrent crises, fixed exchange rate regimes are still in use. Typically, after a crisis, a country that prefers to have a fixed exchange rate

will try to peg again: the cycle of crises may continue. Understanding exchange rate crises is a major goal of international macroeconomics because of the damage they do, not only to the country in which the crisis occurs but often to its neighbors and trading partners. In this chapter we learn about exchange rate crises, their causes, and their consequences.

# 1 Facts About Exchange Rate Crises

To understand the importance of exchange rate crises, let's examine what crises look like and the costs associated with them.

# What is an Exchange Rate Crisis?

A simple definition of an exchange rate crisis would be a "big" depreciation that occurs after a peg breaks. But how big is big enough to qualify as a crisis? In practice, in an advanced country, a  $ 10\% $ to $ 15\% $ depreciation might be considered large. In emerging markets, the bar might be set higher, say, $ 20\% $ to $ 25\% $ . Examples of such crises are shown in Figure 20-1.

Panel (a) shows the depreciation of six European currencies against the German mark after 1992. Four currencies (the escudo, lira, peseta, and pound) were part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM); the other two (the markka and krona) were not in the ERM but were pegging to the German mark. All six currencies lost  $ 15\% $ to $ 25\% $  of their value against the mark within a year.

Panel (b) shows the depreciation of seven emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar in various crises that occurred from 1994 to 2002. These depreciations, while also very rapid, were much larger than those in panel (a). These currencies lost  $ 50\% $ to $ 75\% $  of their value against the dollar in the year following the crisis.

The figure illustrates two important points. First, exchange rate crises can occur in advanced countries as well as in emerging markets and developing countries. Second, the magnitude of the crisis, as measured by the subsequent depreciation of the currency, is often much greater in emerging markets and developing countries.

# How Costly Are Exchange Rate Crises?

There is much evidence on the potentially damaging effects of exchange rate crises. The economic costs are often large, and the political costs can be even more dramatic (see Side Bar: The Political Costs of Crises).

Figure 20-2 presents some evidence on the effects of exchange rate crises. Annual rates of growth of GDP in years close to crises were compared with growth in other (i.e., "normal") years to obtain a measure of how growth differs during crisis periods. The figure shows that just before a crisis all countries have economic growth that is between  $ 0.5\% $ and $ 1.0\% $  below that in normal years.

After a typical exchange rate crisis, advanced countries and emerging markets react differently. Advanced countries tend to bounce back: growth accelerates and is above normal by the second and third years after the crisis. Emerging markets do not bounce back, and growth usually plummets: it is  $ 2.5\% $ to $ 3\% $ below normal in the year of the crisis and the two subsequent years, and is still $ 1\% $  below normal in the third

# The Economic Costs of Crises

Exchange rate crises can impose large economic costs on a country. After a crisis, growth rates in emerging markets and developing countries are, on average, two to three percentage points lower than normal, an effect that persists for about three years. In advanced countries, a depreciation is typically expansionary, and growth is, on average, faster just after the crisis than it was just before.

year. All those reductions in growth add up to about a  $ 10\% $ decline in GDP relative to its typical trend three years after the crisis—a major recession. $ ^4 $

The major downturns in emerging markets often have serious economic and social consequences. For example, in the aftermath of the Argentina crisis of 2001 to 2002, news reports were filled with shocking tales of unemployment, financial ruin, rising poverty, hunger, and deprivation. After the Asian crisis of 1997, the recoveries were a little faster, but the economic misfortunes were still deep and painful.

Causes: Other Economic Crises Why are exchange rate crises sometimes so damaging? From the crises of the 1990s, economists learned that exchange rate crises usually go hand in hand with other types of economically harmful financial crises, especially in emerging markets. In the private sector, if banks and other financial institutions face adverse shocks, they may become insolvent, causing them to close or declare bankruptcy: this is known as a banking crisis. In the public sector, if the government faces adverse shocks, it may default and be unable or unwilling to pay the principal or interest on its debts: this is known as a sovereign debt crisis or default crisis. Both banking and default crises can have damaging effects on the economy because they disrupt the flow of credit within and between countries. (In a later chapter, we examine default crises in more detail, including their links to banking and exchange rate crises.)

# The Political Costs of Crises

Exchange rate crises don't simply have economic consequences—they often have political consequences, too. Figure 20-3 shows that exchange rate crises are often followed by personnel changes at the central bank or finance ministry and not infrequently by a change in a country's leadership as well.

At first, this result might seem odd. As the economist Jeffrey Frankel said, speaking of the Indonesian crisis of 1997: "What is it about devaluation that carries such big political costs? How is it that a strong ruler like Indonesia's Suharto can easily weather 32 years of political, military, ethnic, and environmental challenges, only to succumb to a currency crisis?"*

In emerging markets, we know that the economic costs of exchange rate crises can be large, which helps explain how a Suharto could be undermined. There are many other examples: the Radical Party is the oldest political party in Argentina, but after the exchange rate crisis in 2001 to 2002 under the leadership of President Fernando de la Rúa and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, the party faced extinction, polling just  $ 2.3\% $ in the 2003 presidential election. $ ^{\dagger} $

Still, why do exchange rate crises carry large political costs in advanced countries where the exit from an exchange rate peg often allows for a depreciation and favorable growth performance? A pertinent example is the decision by Britain's Conservative government to exit the ERM on "Black Wednesday," September 16, 1992. Chancellor Norman Lamont left his job within a year, and Prime Minister John Major tasted defeat at the next general election in 1997, despite faster economic growth after 1992.

The legacy of "Black Wednesday" haunted the Conservatives for years. On the question of economic competence, the polls gave the subsequent Labour government a massive lead for many years. It was not until 2010 that the Conservatives regained power, but only in a coalition, and under their fifth leader in 13 years, David Cameron (who had been a junior minister working under Lamont at the Treasury on that fateful day in 1992).

Even when a depreciation turns out to be good for the economy, the collapse of a peg typically destroys the reputations of politicians and policy makers for credibility and competence. Regaining the trust of the people can take a very long time.

Probability of change  $ (\%) $ The Political Costs of Crises Exchange rate crises usually impose large political costs on those in power.

International macroeconomists thus have three crisis types to consider: exchange rate crises, banking crises, and default crises. Evidence shows they can occur one at a time, but they are quite likely to occur simultaneously:

- The likelihood of a banking or default crisis increases significantly when a country is having an exchange rate crisis. One study found that the probability of a banking crisis was 1.6 times higher during an exchange rate crisis (16% versus 10% on average). Another study found that the probability of a default crisis was more than 3 times higher during an exchange rate crisis (39% versus 12% on average). [5] Explanations for these findings focus on valuation effects. As we saw in the last chapter, a big depreciation causes a sudden increase in the local currency value of dollar debts (principal and interest). Because this change in value can raise debt burdens to intolerable levels, exchange rate crises are frequently accompanied by financial distress in the private and public sectors.
The likelihood of an exchange rate crisis increases significantly when a country is having a banking or default crisis. The same two studies just noted found that the probability of an exchange rate crisis was 1.5 times higher during a banking crisis (46% versus 29% on average). The probability of an exchange rate crisis was more than 5 times higher during a default crisis (84% versus 17% on average).

Explanations for these reverse effects center on the issuance of money by the central bank to bail out banks and governments. Banking crises can be horrendously costly. As can be seen in Table 20-1, countries have to cope not only with direct fiscal costs of fixing a damaged banking sector (e.g., through the bailout and recapitalization of insolvent institutions) but also with typically very long and protracted recessions where output is significantly below trend. These slumps in turn create added cyclical drag on the government's fiscal position (lower taxes, higher spending) leading to a large run up in public debt. Such burdens might be handled purely via future fiscal adjustments, but they can sometimes endanger monetary policy and the nominal anchor. If a country is having a banking crisis, the central bank will be under pressure to extend credit or outright transfers to weak banks to prop them up. If a country is having a default crisis, the government will lose access to foreign and domestic loans and may pressure the central bank to lend to the government. This raises a key question: Why does the extension of credit by the central bank threaten an exchange rate peg? In this chapter, we show how a peg works—and how, if the central bank issues too much money to pay for bailouts and/or government deficits, it can place the peg at risk by causing a loss of reserves.

These findings show how crises are likely to happen in pairs, known as twin crises, or all three at once, known as triple crises, magnifying the costs of any one type of crisis.

# Summary

Exchange rate crises have been recurring for more than 100 years, and we have not seen the last of them. They can generate significant economic costs, and policy makers and scholars are seriously concerned about how to prevent them. What is it about

# 2 How Pegs Work: the Mechanics of a Fixed Exchange Rate

To start, we must first understand how a pegged exchange rate works. Once we know what policy makers have to do to make a peg work, we will then be in a position to understand the factors that make a peg break.

To help us understand the economic mechanisms that operate in a fixed exchange rate system, we develop a simple model of what a central bank does. We then use the model to look at the demands placed on a central bank when a country adopts a fixed exchange rate.

# Preliminaries and Assumptions

We consider a small open economy, in which the authorities are trying to peg to some foreign currency. We make the following assumptions, some of which may be relaxed in later analyses:

For convenience, and without implying that we are referring to any specific country, we assume that the home currency is called the peso. The currency to which home pegs is the U.S. dollar. We assume the authorities have been maintaining a fixed exchange rate, with  $ E $ fixed at $ \overline{E} = 1 $  (one peso per U.S. dollar).
- The country's central bank controls the money supply  $ M $  by buying and selling assets in exchange for cash. The central bank trades only two types of assets: domestic bonds, often government bonds, denominated in local currency (pesos), and foreign assets, denominated in foreign currency (dollars).
- The central bank intervenes in the forex market to peg the exchange rate. It stands ready to buy and sell foreign exchange reserves at the fixed exchange rate  $ \overline{E} $ . If it has no reserves, it cannot do this and the exchange rate is free to float: the peg is broken.
Unless stated otherwise, we assume that the peg is credible: everyone believes it will continue to hold. Uncovered interest parity then implies that the home and foreign interest rates are equal:  $ i = i^{*} $ .
We also assume for now that the economy's level of output or income is assumed to be exogenous; that is, it is treated as given and denoted  $ Y $ .
- There is a stable foreign price level  $ P^{*} = 1 $ at all times. In the short run, the home country's price is sticky and fixed at a level $ P = 1 $ . In the long run, if the exchange rate is kept fixed at 1, then the home price level will be fixed at 1 as a result of purchasing power parity.
As in previous chapters, the home country's demand for real money balances  $ M / P $ is determined by the level of output $ Y $ and the nominal interest rate $ i $ and takes the usual form, $ M / P = L(i)Y $ . The money market must be in equilibrium, so money demand is always equal to money supply.
- We use the simplest model of a fixed exchange rate, where there is no financial system. The only money is currency, also known as M0 or the monetary base. The monetary base (M0) and broad money (M1) are then the same, so the money supply is denoted  $ M $ . This assumption allows us to examine the operation of a fixed exchange rate system by considering only the effects of the actions of a central bank.

If there is no financial system, we do not need to worry about the role of private banks in creating broad money through checking deposits, loans, and so on. A simple generalization would allow for banks by letting broad money be a constant multiple of the currency. Still, the existence of a banking system is important, and even without formal theory, we will see later in the chapter how it affects the operation of a fixed exchange rate.

# The Central Bank Balance Sheet

To understand how the home central bank maintains the peg, we must understand how the home central bank manages its assets in relation to its sole liability, the money in circulation.

Suppose the central bank has purchased a quantity  $ B $ pesos of domestic bonds. By, in effect, loaning money to the domestic economy, the central bank's purchases are usually referred to as domestic credit created by the central bank. These purchases are also called the bank's domestic assets. Because the central bank purchases these assets with money, this purchase generates part of the money supply. The part of the home money supply created as a result of the central bank's issuing of domestic credit is denoted $ B $ .

Now suppose the central bank has also purchased a quantity  $ R $ dollars of foreign exchange reserves, usually referred to as reserves or foreign assets, and that the exchange rate is pegged at a level $ \overline{E} = 1 $. The central bank also purchases its reserves with money. Thus, given that the exchange rate has always been 1 (by assumption), the part of the money supply created as a result of the central bank's purchase of foreign exchange reserves is $ \overline{E} R = R $ .<sup>7</sup>

Because the central bank holds only two types of assets, the last two expressions add up to the total money supply in the home economy:
$ $

\underbrace {M} _ {\text {M o n e y s u p p l y}} = \underbrace {B} _ {\text {D o m e s t i c c r e d i t}} + \underbrace {R} _ {\text {R e s e r v e s}} \tag {20-1}

$ $
This equation states that the money supply equals domestic credit plus reserves.

This expression is also useful when expressed not in levels but in changes:
$ $

\underbrace {\Delta M} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n}} = \underbrace {\Delta B} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n}} + \underbrace {\Delta R} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n}} \tag {20-2}

$ $
This expression says that changes in the money supply must result from either changes in domestic credit or changes in reserves.

For example, if the central bank buys additional reserves  $ \Delta R = 1,000 $ dollars, then the money it spends adds $ \Delta M = 1,000 $ pesos to the money in circulation. If the central bank creates additional domestic credit of $ \Delta B = 1,000 $ pesos, then it buys 1,000 pesos of government debt, and this also adds $ \Delta M = 1,000 $  pesos to the money in circulation.

One common way of depicting Equation (20-1) is to write down each entry and construct the central bank balance sheet. The domestic debt and foreign reserves purchased by the central bank are its assets,  $ B + R $. The money supply issued by the central bank $ M $  is its liabilities.

Following is a hypothetical central bank balance sheet. The central bank has purchased 500 million pesos in domestic government bonds and 500 million pesos in foreign exchange reserves. The total money in circulation resulting from these purchases is 1,000 million pesos. As on any balance sheet, total assets equal total liabilities.

# Fixing, Floating, and the Role of Reserves

The crucial assumption in our simple model is that the central bank maintains the peg by intervening in the foreign exchange market by buying and selling reserves at the fixed exchange rate. In other words, our model supposes that if the central bank wants to fix the exchange rate, it must have some reserves it can trade to achieve that goal. We also assume, for now, that it holds reserves only for this purpose. Thus:

We are assuming that the exchange rate is fixed if and only if the central bank holds reserves; and the exchange rate is floating if and only if the central bank has no reserves.

These assumptions simplify our analysis by clarifying the relationship between the central bank balance sheet and the exchange rate regime. In reality, the relationship may be less clear, but the mechanisms in our model still play a dominant role.

For example, countries may adjust domestic credit as well as reserves, but they never try to maintain a peg by relying solely on domestic credit adjustments and zero reserves. Why? In the very short run, forex market conditions can change so quickly that only direct intervention in that market through reserve trading can maintain the peg. In addition, large adjustments to domestic credit may pose problems in an emerging market by causing instability in the bond market as the central bank buys or sells potentially large amounts of government bonds.

Countries can also float and yet keep some reserves on hand for reasons that we ignore in our model so as to keep it simple. They may want reserves on hand for future emergencies, such as war; or as a savings buffer in the event of a sudden stop to financial flows; or so they can peg at some later date.[8] Thus, the minimum level of reserves the central bank will tolerate on its balance sheet may not be at zero, but allowing for some other forms of reserves would not affect our analysis.

# How Reserves Adjust to Maintain the Peg

We now turn to the key questions we need to answer to understand how a peg works. What level of reserves must the central bank have to maintain the peg? And how are reserves affected by changing macroeconomic conditions? If the central bank can maintain a level of reserves above zero, we know the peg will hold. If not, the peg breaks.

We can rearrange Equation (20-1) to solve for the level of reserves, with  $ R = M - B $ . Why do we do that? It is important to remember that reserves are the unknown variable here: by assumption, reserves change as a result of the central bank's interventions in the forex market, which it must undertake to maintain the peg.

Because (in nominal terms) money supply equals money demand, given by  $ M = \overline{P} L(i)Y $, we can restate and rearrange Equation (20-1) to solve for the level of reserves: $ $

\underbrace {R} _ {\text {R e s e r v e s}} = \underbrace {\overline {{P}} L (i) Y} _ {\text {M o n e y D e m a n d D o m e s t i c C r e d i t}} - \underbrace {B} _ {\text {D o m e s t i c C r e d i t}} \tag {20-3}

$ $
By substituting money demand for money supply, we can investigate how shocks to money demand (say, due to changes in output or the interest rate) or shocks to domestic credit affect the level of reserves.

We can solve this equation. Under our current assumptions, every element on the right-hand side is exogenous and known. The home price level is fixed, the output level is exogenous, interest parity tells us that the home interest rate equals the foreign interest rate, and we can treat domestic credit as predetermined by the central bank's purchases of domestic government debt.

Why is this answer for the reserve level correct and unique? Recall how forex market equilibrium is attained from the chapter on exchange rates in the short run. If the central bank bought more reserves than this, home money supply would expand and the home nominal interest rate would fall, the peso would depreciate, and the peg would break. To prevent this, the central bank would need to intervene in the forex market. The central bank would have to offset its initial purchase of reserves to keep the supply of pesos constant and keep the exchange rate holding steady. Similarly, if the central bank sells reserves for pesos, it would cause the peso to appreciate and would have to reverse course and buy back the reserves. The peg means that the central bank must keep the reserves at the level specified in Equation (20-3).

# Graphical Analysis of the Central Bank Balance Sheet

Based on this toolkit, we show the mechanics of a pegged exchange rate in Figure 20-4, which illustrates the central bank balance sheet. On the horizontal axis is the money supply  $ M $ and on the vertical axis is domestic credit $ B $, both measured in pesos. Money demand is initially at the level $ M_{1} $, and domestic credit is at $ B_{1} $ .

Two important lines appear in this figure. If reserves  $ R $ are zero, then all of the money supply is due to domestic credit and Equation (20-1) tells us that $ M = B $. The points where $ M = B $ are on the 45-degree line. Points on this line, like point $ Z $ , correspond to cases in which the central bank balance sheet contains no reserves. By assumption, the country will then have a floating exchange rate, so we call this the floating line.

When the assets of the central bank include both reserves and domestic credit, then  $ B $ and $ R $ are both greater than zero and they add up to $ M $ . The state of the central bank balance sheet must correspond to a point such as point 1 in this diagram, somewhere

The Central Bank Balance Sheet Diagram On the 45-degree line, reserves are at zero, and the money supply  $ M $ equals domestic credit $ B $. Variations in the money supply along this line would cause the exchange rate to float. There is a unique level of the money supply $ M_{1} $ (here assumed to be 1,000) that ensures the exchange rate is at its chosen fixed value. To fix the money supply at this level, the central bank must choose a mix of assets on its balance sheet that corresponds to points on line $ XZ $, points at which domestic credit $ B $ is less than money supply $ M $. At point $ Z $, reserves would be at zero; at point $ X $, reserves would be 100% of the money supply. Any point in between on $ XZ $ is a feasible choice. At point 1, for example, domestic credit is $ B_{1} = 500 $, reserves are $ R_{1} = 500 $, and $ B_{1} + R_{1} = M_{1} = 1,000 $ .

on the vertical line  $ XZ $. We call this the fixed line because on this line the money supply is at the level $ M_{3} $  necessary to maintain the peg.

If domestic credit is  $ B_{1} $, then reserves are $ R_{1} = M_{1} - B_{1} $, the vertical (or horizontal) distance between point 1 and the 45-degree floating line. Hence, the distance to the floating line tells us how close to danger the peg is by showing how close the central bank is to the point at which reserves run out. The point farthest from danger is $ X $, on the horizontal axis. At this point, domestic credit $ B $ is zero and reserves $ R $ equal the money supply $ M $. A fixed exchange rate that always operates with reserves equal to $ 100\% $  of the money supply is known as a currency board system.[10]

To sum up: if the exchange rate is floating, the central bank balance sheet must correspond to points on the 45-degree floating line; if the exchange rate is fixed, the central bank balance sheet must correspond to points on the vertical fixed line.

The model is now complete, and with the aid of our key tools—the tables and graphs of the central bank balance sheet—we can see how a central bank that is trying to maintain a peg reacts to two types of shocks. We first look at shocks to the level of money demand and then shocks to the composition of money supply.

# Defending the Peg I: Changes in the Level of Money Demand

We first look at shocks to money demand and how they affect reserves by altering the level of money supply  $ M $. As we saw in Equation (20-3), money supply is equal to money demand, as given by the equation $ M = \overline{P} L(i)Y $. If the price level is fixed, then money demand will fluctuate only in response to shocks in output $ Y $ and the home interest rate $ i $ (which equals the foreign interest rate $ i^* $  if the peg is credible). For now, output is exogenous, and a rise in output will raise money demand. The foreign interest rate is also exogenous, and a rise in the foreign interest rate will raise the home interest rate and thus lower money demand. We assume all else is equal, so domestic credit is constant.

A Shock to Home Output or the Foreign Interest Rate Suppose output falls or the foreign interest rate rises. We treat either of these events as an exogenous shock for now, all else equal, and suppose it decreases money demand by, say,  $ 10\% $  at the current interest rate.

For example, suppose we start with a central bank balance sheet as given earlier. Initially, money supply is \( M_{1} = 1,000 \) million pesos. Suppose money demand then falls by \( 10\% \). This would lower money demand by \( 10\% \) to \( M_{2} = 900 \) million pesos. A fall in the demand for money would lower the interest rate in the money market and put depreciation pressure on the home currency. A floating exchange rate would allow the home currency to depreciate in these circumstances. To maintain the peg, the central bank must keep the interest rate unchanged. To achieve this goal, it must sell 100 million pesos (\(100 million) of reserves, in exchange for cash, so that money supply contracts as much as money demand. The central bank's balance sheet will then be as follows:

<table><tr><td colspan="3">SIMPLIFIED CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEET AFTER MONEY DEMAND FALLS (MILLIONS OF PESOS)</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td>Liabilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reserves R     400 Foreign assets (dollar reserves)</td><td>Money supply M    900 Currency in circulation</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Domestic credit B     500 Domestic assets (peso bonds)</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

In Figure 20-5, we can trace the implications of the shock in a graph. The demand for money has fallen, so the fixed line is still vertical, but it shifts from the initial money demand level  $ M_{1} = 1,000 $ to a new lower level $ M_{2} = 900 $. There is no change to domestic credit, so it remains constant at the level $ B_{1} = 500 $. Thus, the central bank's balance sheet position shifts from point 1 to point 2. This shift takes the balance sheet position closer to the floating line in the diagram: reserves are falling. At point 2, reserves have fallen from $ R_{1} = 500 $ to $ R_{2} = 400 $ , as shown.

# Figure 20-5

Central Bank Balance Sheet
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/e7a23a5daa9c0a39f2d8f41307b896c4ba61e9b48b4fef88852d86e1fb1d9797.jpg)
Shocks to Money Demand If money demand falls, interest rates tend to fall, leading to pressure for an exchange rate to depreciate. To prevent this, the central bank must intervene in the forex market and defend the peg by selling reserves and hence lowering the money supply to keep the interest rate fixed and ensure that money supply equals money demand. As shown here, the money supply declines from  $ M_{1} = 1,000 $ to $ M_{2} = 900 $. If domestic credit is unchanged at $ B_{1} = 500 $, the change in the central bank balance sheet is shown by a move from point 1 to point 2, and reserves absorb the money demand shock by falling from $ R_{1} = 500 $ to $ R_{2} = 400 $. An opposite positive shock is shown by the move from point 1 to point 3, where $ M_{3} = 1,100 $ and $ R_{3} = 600 $. In a currency board system, a country maintaining $ 100\% $ reserves will be on the horizontal axis with zero domestic credit, $ B = 0 $. A currency board adjusts to money demand shocks by moving from point 1' to points $ 2' $ or $ 3' $ .

Figure 20-5 also shows what would happen with the opposite shock. If money demand increased by  $ 10\% $ from the initial money demand level $ M_{1} = 1,000 $ to a new higher level $ M_{3} = 1,100 $, the central bank would need to prevent an interest rate rise and an appreciation by expanding the money supply by 100 pesos. The central bank would need to intervene and increase the money supply by purchasing \$ 100 of reserves. The central bank's balance sheet position would then shift from point 1 to point 3, moving away from the floating line, with reserves rising from  $ R_{1} = 500 $ to $ R_{3} = 600 $ .

Equation (20-3) confirms these outcomes as a general result when domestic credit is constant (at  $ B_{1} $ in our example). We know that if the change in domestic credit is zero, $ \Delta B = 0 $, then any change in money supply must equal the change in reserves, $ \Delta R = \Delta M $ . This is also clear from Equation (20-2).

We have shown the following: holding domestic credit constant, a change in money demand leads to an equal change in reserves.

The Importance of the Backing Ratio In the first example above, money demand and money supply fell by  $ 10\% $ from 1,000 to 900, but reserves fell by $ 20\% $  from 500 to 400. The proportional fall in reserves was greater than the proportional fall in money

because reserves  $ R $ were initially only 500 and just a fraction (one-half) of the money supply $ M $ , which was 1,000. When money demand fell by 100, reserves had to absorb all of the change, with domestic credit unchanged.

The ratio  $ R / M $ is called the backing ratio, and it indicates the fraction of the money supply that is backed by reserves on the central bank balance sheet. It, therefore, tells us the size of the maximum negative money demand shock that the regime can withstand without running out of reserves if domestic credit remains unchanged. In our example, the backing ratio was 0.5 or $ 50\% $ (reserves were 500 and money supply 1,000 initially), so the central bank could absorb up to a $ 50\% $ decline in the money supply before all of its reserves run out. Because reserves were only 500 to start with, a shock of $ -500 $  to money demand would cause reserves to just run out.

In general, for a given size of a shock to money demand, a higher backing ratio will better insulate an economy against running out of reserves, all else equal.[11]

In Figure 20-5, the higher the backing ratio, the higher the level of reserves  $ R $ and the lower the level of domestic credit $ B $, for a given level of money supply $ M $ . In other words, the central bank balance sheet position on this figure would be closer to the horizontal axis and farther away from the floating line. This is a graphical illustration of the idea that a high backing ratio makes a peg safer.

Currency Board Operation This maximum backing ratio of  $ 100\% $ is maintained at all times by a currency board. A $ 100\% $ backing ratio puts the country exactly on the horizontal axis. In Figure 20-5, a currency board would start at point $ 1' $, not point 1. Because reserves would then be 1,000 to start with, a shock of up to $ -1,000 $ to money demand could be accommodated without reserves running out. In the face of smaller shocks to money demand such as we have considered, of plus or minus 100, the central bank balance sheet would move to points $ 2' $ or $ 3' $, with reserves equal to money supply equal to money demand equal to 900 or 1,100. These points are as far away from the 45-degree floating line as one can get in this diagram, and they show how a currency board keeps reserves at a maximum $ 100\% $. A currency board can be thought of as the safest configuration of the central bank's balance sheet because with $ 100\% $  backing, the central bank can cope with any shock to money demand without running out of reserves. Currency boards are considered a hard peg because their high backing ratio ought to confer on them greater resilience in the face of money demand shocks.

Why Does the Level of Money Demand Fluctuate? Our result tells us that to maintain the fixed exchange rate, the central bank must have enough reserves to endure a money demand shock without running out. A shock to money demand is not under the control of the authorities, but they must respond to it. Thus, it is important for policy makers to understand the sources and likely magnitudes of such shocks. Under our assumptions, money demand shocks originate either in shocks to home output  $ Y $ or the foreign interest rate $ i^{*} $ (because under a credible peg $ i = i^{*} $ ).

We have studied output fluctuations in earlier chapters, and one thing we observed was that output tends to be much more volatile in emerging markets and developing countries. Thus, the prudent level of reserves is likely to be much higher in these countries. Volatility in foreign interest rates can also be important, whether in U.S. dollars or in other currencies that form the base for pegs.

However, we must also confront a new possibility—that the peg is not fully credible and that simple interest parity fails to hold. In this case, the home interest rate will no longer equal the foreign interest rate, and additional disturbances to home money demand can be caused by the spread between the two. As we now see, this is a vital step toward understanding crises in emerging markets and developing countries.

# Risk Premiums in Advanced and Emerging Markets

So far in the book, we have assumed that uncovered interest parity (UIP) requires that the domestic return (the interest rate on home bank deposits) equals the foreign interest rate plus the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency. However, an important extension of UIP needs to be made when additional risks affect home bank deposits: a risk premium is then added to the foreign interest rate to compensate investors for the perceived risk of holding a home domestic currency deposit. This perceived risk is due to an aversion to exchange rate risk or a concern about default risk:
$ $

i = i ^ {*} + \underbrace {\frac {\Delta E _ {\text {p e s o} / \mathbb {S}} ^ {e}}{E _ {\text {p e s o} / \mathbb {S}}} + \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {E x c h a n g e r a t e} \\ \text {r i s k p r e m i u m} \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {D e f a u l t} \\ \text {r i s k p r e m i u m} \end{array} \right]} _ {\substack {\text {P e s o} \\ \text {i n t e r s t} \\ \text {r a t e}}} + \underbrace {\text {E x p e c t e d r a t e o f}} _ {\substack {\text {D o d d a r} \\ \text {i n t e r s t} \\ \text {r a t e}}}

$ $
The left-hand side is still the domestic return, but the right-hand side is now a risk-adjusted foreign return. The final three terms are the difference between home and foreign interest rates, and their sum total is known as the interest rate spread. What causes these spreads?

The first part of the interest rate spread is the currency premium:
$ $

\text {C u r r e n c y p r e m i u m} = \frac {\Delta E _ {\text {p e s o / S}} ^ {e}}{E _ {\text {p e s o / S}}} + \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {E x c h a n g e r a t e} \\ \text {r i s k p r e m i u m} \end{array} \right]

$ $
The currency premium should be zero for a credibly pegged exchange rate: the peso is not expected to change in value relative to the dollar. But if a peg is not credible, and investors suspect that the peg may break, there could be a premium reflecting both the size of the expected depreciation and the currency's perceived riskiness. The currency premium therefore reflects the credibility of monetary policy.

The second part of the interest rate spread is known as the country premium:
$ $

\text {C o u n t r y p r e m i u m} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {D e f a u l t} \\ \text {r i s k p r e m i u m} \end{array} \right]

$ $
The country premium is compensation for perceived default risk (settlement or counterparty risk). It will be greater than zero if investors suspect a risk of losses when they

attempt to convert a home (peso) asset back to foreign currency (dollars) in the future. Such a loss might occur because of expropriation, bank failure, surprise taxation, delays, capital controls, other regulations, and so on. The country premium therefore reflects the credibility of property rights.

Why does all this matter? Fluctuations in currency and country premiums have the same effect in Equation (20-4) as fluctuations in the foreign interest rate  $ i^{*} $. Sudden increases in the interest rate spread raise the risk-adjusted foreign return and imply sudden increases in the domestic return, here given by the (peso) interest rate $ i $ . In some countries, these spreads can be large and volatile—and even more volatile than the foreign interest rate.

Figure 20-6 presents interest rate spreads for two countries with fixed exchange rates. Panel (a) shows an advanced country, Denmark, which pegs to the euro; panel (b) shows an emerging market, Argentina, which pegged to the dollar from 1991 to 2001.

In Denmark, there was some spread in the early years of the euro from 1999 to 2002 (up to about  $ 0.5\% $ per year), and again some wider spreads in the 2009-10 crisis period, perhaps reflecting a worry that the krone-euro peg might not endure. Otherwise the spread was almost imperceptible (less than $ 0.1\% $ per year). Overall, the simple correlation between the krone interest rate and the euro interest rate was very high, equal to 0.96. Investors came to see the peg as credible, eliminating the currency premium almost entirely. They also had no fear of default risk if they invested in Denmark, eliminating the country premium almost entirely. Thus one could assume at most times that $ i $ was approximately equal to $ i^{*} $  with no spread.

In Argentina the spreads were large: note the bigger vertical scale in panel (b). The annual peso and dollar interest rates were far apart, often differing by 2 or 3 percentage points and sometimes differing by more than 10 percentage points. Most striking is that changes in the spread were usually more important in determining the Argentine interest rate than were changes in the actual foreign (U.S. dollar) interest rate. Overall, the correlation between the peso interest rate  $ i $ and the dollar interest rate $ i^* $  was low, equal to only 0.38. What was going on?

We can separately track currency risk and country risk because Argentine banks offered interest-bearing bank deposits denominated in both U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos. The lower two lines in panel (b) show the interest rate on U.S. dollar deposits in the United States  $ (i^{*}) $  and the interest rate on U.S. dollar deposits in Argentina. Because the rates are expressed in the same currency, the difference between these two interest rates cannot be the result of a currency premium. It represents a pure measure of country premium: investors required a higher interest rate on dollar deposits in Argentina than on dollar deposits in the United States because they perceived that Argentine deposits might be subject to a default risk. (Investors were eventually proved right: in the 2001-2002 crisis, many Argentine banks faced insolvency, some were closed for a time, capital controls were imposed at the border, and a "pesification" law turned many dollar assets into peso assets ex post, a form of expropriation and a contractual default.)

The upper line in panel (b) shows the interest rate on peso deposits in Argentina (i), which is even higher than the interest rate on U.S. dollar deposits in Argentina. Because these are interest rates on bank deposits in the same country, the difference between these two rates cannot be due to a country premium. It represents a pure measure of currency premium. Investors required a higher interest rate on peso deposits in Argentina than on dollar deposits in Argentina because they perceived that peso deposits might be subject to a risk of depreciation, that is, a collapse of the

Interest Rate Spreads: Currency Premiums and Country Premiums When advanced countries peg, the interest rate spread is usually close to zero, and we can assume  $ i = i^{*} $ . An example is Denmark's peg to the euro in panel (a), where the correlation between the krone and euro interest rates is 0.96. When emerging markets peg, interest rate spreads can be large and volatile, due to both currency and country premiums. An example is Argentina's peg to the U.S. dollar in panel (b), where the correlation between the peso interest rate and the U.S. interest rate is only 0.38.

peg. (Investors were eventually proved right again: in the 2001-2002 crisis, the peso depreciated by  $ 75\% $ from \$ 1 to the peso to about \$ 0.25 to the peso, or four pesos per U.S. dollar.)

Summary Pegs in emerging markets are different from those in advanced countries. Because of fluctuations in interest rate spreads, they are subject to even greater interest rate shocks than the pegs of advanced countries, as a result of credibility problems.

Currency premiums may fluctuate due to changes in investors' beliefs about the durability of the peg, a problem of the credibility of monetary policy. Country premiums may fluctuate due to changes in investors' beliefs about the security of their investments, a problem of the credibility of property rights.

Still, not every movement in emerging market spreads is driven by economic fundamentals. For example, in Argentina the figure shows that investors revised their risk premiums sharply upward when other emerging market countries were experiencing crises in the 1990s: Mexico in 1994, Asia in 1997, and later Russia and Brazil. With the exception of Brazil (a major trade partner for Argentina), there were no major changes in Argentine fundamentals during these crises. Thus, many economists consider this to be evidence of contagion in global capital markets, possibly even a sign of market inefficiency or irrationality, where crises in some parts of the global capital markets trigger adverse changes in market sentiment in faraway places.

# The Argentine Convertibility Plan Before the Tequila Crisis

The central bank balance sheet diagram helps us to see how a central bank manages a fixed exchange rate and what adjustments it needs to make in response to a shock in money demand.

We can put this analysis to use with a concrete example: the operation of Argentina's fixed exchange rate system (known as the Convertibility Plan), which began in 1991 and ended in 2002. In this plan, a peg was maintained as one peso per dollar. With the aid of Figure 20-7, we focus first on how the central bank managed its balance sheet during an early phase of the plan, in 1993 and 1994. (We will discuss later years shortly.)

Money Demand Shocks, 1993-1994 The evolution of money supply and reserves is shown in panel (a). From point 1 to point 2 (April 1993 to November/ December 1994), all was going well. Argentina had recovered from its hyperinflation in 1989 to 1990, prices were stable, the economy was growing, and so was money demand. Because money demand must equal money supply, the central bank had to increase the money supply. The central bank kept domestic credit more or less unchanged in this period at 4 billion pesos, so reserves had to expand (from 8 billion to 11 billion pesos) as the base money supply expanded (from 12 billion to 15 billion pesos). The backing ratio rose from about  $ 67\% $ (8/12) to about $ 73\% $ (11/15). In the central bank balance sheet diagram in panel (b), this change is shown by the horizontal move from point 1 to point 2 as the money demand shock causes the fixed line to shift out from $ M_{1} $ to $ M_{2} $ , so that higher levels of base money supply are now consistent with the peg.

Then an unexpected nasty shock happened: a risk premium shock occurred as a result of the so-called Tequila crisis in Mexico in December 1994. Interest rate spreads widened for Argentina because of currency and country premiums, raising the home interest rate. Argentina's money demand fell. In panel (a), from point 2 to point 3 (November/December 1994 to January/February 1995), base money supply contracted by 1 billion pesos, and this was absorbed almost entirely by a contraction in reserves from 11 billion to 10 billion pesos. The backing ratio fell to about  $ 71\% $ (10/14). In panel (b), this change is shown by the horizontal move from point 2 to point 3 as the money demand shock causes the fixed line to shift in from $ M_{2} $ to $ M_{3} $ .

Argentina's Central Bank Operations, 1993-1997 In this period, one peso was worth one U.S. dollar. Panel (a) shows the money supply and reserves. The difference between the two is domestic credit. Six key dates are highlighted before, during, and after the Mexican Tequila crisis. In panel (b), the balance sheet of the central bank at these key dates is shown. Prior to the crisis, domestic credit was essentially unchanged, and reserves grew from  \$ 8 billion to \$ 11 billion as money demand grew from $ M_{1} $ to $ M_{2} $ in line with rapid growth in incomes (move from point 1 to 2). After the crisis hit in December 1994, interest rate spreads widened, money demand fell from $ M_{2} $ to $ M_{3} $, but domestic credit stood still (to point 3) and \$ 1  billion in reserves were lost. In 1995 there was a run on banks and on the currency, and the central bank sterilized by expanding domestic credit by 5 billion pesos and selling  \$ 5  billion of reserves as money demand remained constant (to point 4). Reserves reached a low level of  \$ 5  billion. By 1996 the crisis had passed and the central bank now replenished its reserves, reversing the earlier sterilization. Domestic credit fell by 5 billion pesos and reserves increased by  \$ 5  billion (to point 5, same as point 3). Further sterilized purchases of  \$ 4  billion of reserves brought the backing ratio up to  $ 100\% $  in 1997 (to point 6).

Source: IMF, International Financial Statistics. Data compiled by Kurt Schuler.

To Be Continued Through all of these events, the backing ratio remained high and domestic credit remained roughly steady at around 4 billion pesos, corresponding to our model's assumptions so far. People wanted to swap some pesos for dollars, but nothing catastrophic had happened. However, this was about to change. The shock to Argentina's interest rate proved damaging to the real economy and especially the banking sector. Argentines also became nervous about holding pesos. Foreigners stopped lending to Argentina as the economic situation looked riskier. The central bank stepped in to provide assistance to the ailing banks. But we have yet to work out how a central bank can do this and still maintain a peg. After we complete that task, we will return to the story and see how Argentina managed to survive the Tequila crisis.

# Defending the Peg Ii: Changes in the Composition of Money Supply

So far we have examined changes to the level of money demand. We have assumed that the central bank's policy toward domestic credit was passive, and so  $ B $ has been held constant up to now. In contrast, we now study shocks to domestic credit $ B $ , all else equal. To isolate the effects of changes in domestic credit, we assume that money demand is constant.

If money demand is constant, then so is money supply. Therefore, the key lesson of this section will be that, on its own, a change in domestic credit cannot affect the level of the money supply, it can only affect the composition in terms of domestic credit and reserves.

A Shock to Domestic Credit Suppose that the central bank increases domestic credit by an amount  $ \Delta B > 0 $ from $ B_{1} $ to $ B_{2} $ . This increase could be the result of an open market operation by the bank's bond trading desk to purchase bonds from private parties. Or it could be the result of a demand by the country's economics ministry that the bank directly finance government borrowing. For now we will not concern ourselves with the cause of this policy decision, and will not discuss whether it makes any sense. We just ask what implications it has for a central bank trying to maintain a peg, all else equal. We assume that domestic output and the foreign interest rate are unchanged.

For example, suppose we start with a central bank balance sheet with money supply at its initial level of  $ M_{1} = 1,000 $ million pesos. The bank then expands domestic credit from $ 500 $ million pesos by buying $ \Delta B = \\(100 $  million of peso bonds. All else equal, this action puts more money in circulation, which lowers the interest rate in the money market and puts depreciation pressure on the exchange rate. A floating rate would depreciate in these circumstances. To defend the peg, the central bank must sell enough reserves to keep the interest rate unchanged. To achieve that, it must sell 100 million pesos (\)100 million) of reserves, in exchange for cash, so that the money supply remains unchanged. The central bank's balance sheet will then be as follows:

SIMPLIFIED CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEET AFTER EXPANSION OF DOMESTIC CREDIT (MILLIONS OF PESOS)

What is the end result? Domestic credit  $ B $ changes by $ +100 $ million pesos (rising to 600 million pesos), foreign exchange reserves $ R $ change by $ -100 $ million pesos (falling to 400 million pesos), and the money supply $ M $  remains unchanged (at 1,000 million pesos).

The bond purchases expand domestic credit but also cause the central bank to lose reserves as it is forced to intervene in the forex market. There is no change in monetary policy as measured by home money supply (or interest rates) because the sale and purchase actions by the central bank offset each other exactly. This type of central bank action is called sterilization, a sterilized intervention, or a sterilized sale of reserves.

In Figure 20-8, we show the implications of sterilization policies. On the vertical axis, domestic credit rises from  $ B_{1} $ to $ B_{2} $. The balance sheet position of the central bank therefore shifts up the fixed line from point 1 to point 2. Reserves fall by $ \Delta B $ from $ R_{1} = \\(500 $ million to $ R_{2} = \ $ 400\) million. The central bank has moved closer to point $ Z $, the danger point of zero reserves on the 45-degree line. The backing ratio falls from 50 to $ 40\% $ .

Figure 20-8 also shows what would happen with the opposite shock. If domestic credit fell by 100 million pesos to 400 million pesos at  $ B_{3} $, with an unchanged money demand, then reserves would rise by \$ 100 million. The central bank's balance sheet ends up at point 3. Reserves rise from  $ R_{1} = 500 $ to $ R_{3} = 600 $ . The backing ratio now rises from 50% to 60%.

Sterilization If domestic credit rises, money supply rises, all else equal, interest rates tend to fall, putting pressure on the exchange rate to depreciate. To prevent this depreciation, keep the peg, and stay on the fixed line, the central bank must intervene and defend the peg by selling reserves to keep the money supply fixed. As shown here, the money supply is  $ M_{1} = 1,000 $. If domestic credit increases from $ B_{1} = 500 $ to $ B_{2} = 600 $, the central bank balance sheet moves from point 1 to point 2, and reserves fall from $ R_{1} = 500 $ to $ R_{2} = 400 $. An opposite shock is shown by the move from point 1 to point 3, where $ B_{3} = 400 $ and $ R_{3} = 600 $. If the country maintains $ 100\% $ reserves, it has to stay at point $ 1' $ : a currency board cannot engage in sterilization.

We also see in Figure 20-8 that sterilization is impossible in the case of a currency board because a currency board requires that domestic credit always be zero and that reserves be  $ 100\% $  of the money supply at all times.

Equation (20-3) confirms this as a general result. We know that if the change in money demand is zero, then so is the change in money supply,  $ \Delta M = 0 $; hence, the change in domestic credit, $ \Delta B > 0 $, must be offset by an equal and opposite change in reserves, $ \Delta R = -\Delta B < 0 $ . This is also clear from Equation (20-2).

We have shown the following: holding money demand constant, a change in domestic credit leads to an equal and opposite change in reserves, which is called a sterilization.

Why Does the Composition of the Money Supply Fluctuate? Our model tells us that sterilization has no effect on the level of money supply and hence no effect on interest rates and the rest of the economy. This prompts a question: if sterilization has no effect on these variables, why would central banks bother to do it? In the case of buying and selling government bonds, which is the predominant form of domestic credit, the effects are controversial but are generally thought to be small. The only possible effect would be indirect, via portfolio changes in the bond market. If the central bank absorbs some government debt, it leaves less peso debt for the private sector to hold, and this could change the risk premium on the domestic interest rate. But evidence for that type of effect is rather weak.[12]

However, there is another type of domestic credit that can have very important effects on the wider economy. This is domestic credit caused by a decision by the central bank to lend to private commercial banks in difficulty. Here, the central bank would be fulfilling one of its traditional responsibilities as the protector of the domestic financial system. This action has real effects because a domestic banking crisis, if allowed to happen, can cause serious economic harm by damaging the economy's payments system and credit markets.

In theory, when it comes to banks that are having difficulties, economists distinguish between banks that are illiquid and those that are insolvent. Let's see how loans from the central bank to private commercial banks affect the central bank balance sheet for these two cases. Note that for these cases we can no longer assume that M0 (currency or base money) is the same as M1 (narrow money, which includes checking deposits) or M2 (broad money, which includes saving deposits).

■ Insolvency and bailouts. A private bank is insolvent if the value of its liabilities (e.g., customers' deposits) exceeds the value of its assets (e.g., loans, other securities, and cash on hand). Often, this happens when the bank's assets unexpectedly lose value (loans turn bad, stocks crash). In some circumstances, the government may offer a rescue or bailout to banks in such a damaged state, because it may be unwilling to see the bank fail (for political or even for economic reasons, if the bank provides valuable intermediation services to the

economy). This bailout could be direct from the finance ministry. But the rescue may happen another way, and even in stages, if the banks ask for a loan from the central bank ostensibly for temporary liquidity purposes, and then (after losses appear) find their loans rolled over for a very long time, or even forgiven with some or all interest and principal unpaid.

Suppose the central bank balance sheet was originally 500 reserves and 500 domestic credit, with base money supply of 1,000. The cash from a bailout (say, 100) goes to the private bank and domestic credit rises (by 100) to 600 on the central bank's balance sheet. Because there has been no increase in base money demand, but more cash has gone into circulation, reserves must fall (by 100) to 400, as in Figure 20-9, panel (a). This central bank action is equivalent to the central bank buying bonds worth 100 directly from the government (a sterilization, as we saw previously) and the government then bailing out the private bank with the proceeds. Bottom line: bailouts are very risky for the central bank because they cause reserves to drain, endangering the peg.

Illiquidity and bank runs. A private bank may be solvent, but it can still be illiquid: it holds some cash, but its loans cannot be sold (liquidated) quickly at a high price and depositors can withdraw at any time. If too many depositors attempt to withdraw their funds at once, the bank is in trouble if it has insufficient cash on hand: this is known as a bank run. In this situation, the central bank may lend money to commercial banks that are running out of cash. Suppose, for example, the monetary base is M0 and equals 1,000 as in the last example, but broad money is M2 (including bank deposits) and equals 2,000. The difference of 1,000 is the value of bank checking and saving deposits. If there is a run at a bank, and customers rush in and demand 100 in cash, the bank has to borrow 100 from somewhere to satisfy them. We suppose the bank is at zero cash or at the lowest level permitted by regulation—so it is constrained. Because every other bank is likewise constrained, fearful of lending to the troubled bank, or also experiencing a run, the problem cannot be solved by interbank lending. The central bank is then the lender of last resort. Crucially, in addition to the central bank expanding domestic credit (by 100) to 600, base money demand (demand for cash) also rises (by 100) to 1,100. Thus, we have a combination of the two types of shocks we have studied: an increase in domestic credit and an increase in (base) money demand, as shown in Figure 20-9, panel (b). Reserves do not change; they stay at 500. Why? The central bank is satisfying a demand for more cash, which absorbs the expansion of domestic credit. The situation will revert to normal when the run ends and the private bank pays back its loan to the central bank. Bottom line: providing liquidity to solvent banks is not risky for the central bank because there is no reserve drain to threaten the peg.

This simple classification of banks as insolvent or illiquid is useful but the reality is more complex. The difference between insolvency and illiquidity is often unclear. If depositors fear that banks have either problem, and that the central bank may bail them out slowly or partially, they will seek to withdraw their deposits and put them in a safe place. If the problems are potentially big, the fear may affect all depositors and all banks, and depositors will not be able to tell which banks are safe, which are illiquid, and which are insolvent. The problem gets more dangerous if the financial system is more complex, when banks have borrowing relationships with each other, for if one suffers losses and fails then it will cause spillover losses for others, and more

(b) Lender of Last Resort Operation Central Bank Balance Sheet

The Central Bank and the Financial Sector In panel (a), a bailout occurs when the central bank prints money and buys domestic assets—the bad assets of insolvent private banks. There is no change in demand for base money (cash), so the expansion of domestic credit leads to a decrease of reserves. In panel (b), private bank depositors want to shift from holding deposits to holding cash. If the central bank acts as a lender of last resort and temporarily lends the needed cash to illiquid private banks, both the demand and supply of base money (cash) rise, so the level of reserves is unchanged.

The Old Lady doth protest too much: In September 2007, the Bank of England assured Northern Rock depositors that the bank would not fail. The bank's balance sheet was widely believed to be healthy (solvency), but the bank had run short of cash to fund mortgages (illiquidity). Despite official assurances, there was a run on the bank because depositors preferred cash in hand to government promises.

possible failures. In many emerging markets and developing countries, this kind of panic often leads depositors to hold foreign bank deposits instead of deposits in local currency. This flight to foreign bank deposits happens because depositors do not know if, when, or how much of a bailout will occur. Thus they cannot be sure if the peg will hold, and if their peso deposits will

in the end keep their value in dollar terms. In such circumstances, depositors' fears can be self-fulfilling. A bank that faces a run may have to sell illiquid assets in a hurry at a low price, damaging itself and magnifying the problem. As depositors demand foreign currency, they drain reserves and make it more likely that devaluation will happen. A country at risk for devaluation faces a higher-risk premium, which in turn worsens economic conditions and encourages a flight from the domestic currency. If a depreciation happens, then banks and firms that have foreign currency liabilities will be in even worse shape, so running looks even better. And so the vicious circle continues.

To get a sense of the challenges faced by a central bank when confronted with difficulties in the banking sector under a fixed exchange rate, let us return to the case of Argentina after the Mexican Tequila crisis.

# Application

# The Argentine Convertibility Plan After the Tequila Crisis

When we left Argentina at the end of the last application, the Mexican Tequila crisis had just hit in December 1994, and Argentina's base money supply had fallen by a billion pesos. This change was shown in Figure 20-7 by the move from point 2 to point 3. With domestic credit steady, this meant that reserves also fell by a billion pesos to a level of 10 billion in January/February 1995.

Banking Crisis, 1995 Higher interest rates were reducing output as the private sector struggled with the high cost of credit. The government's budget deficit grew as tax revenues fell. Commercial bank balance sheets were damaged by bad loans and depressed asset prices. The country now faced the threat of a banking crisis.[13]

The central bank began extending loans, even to banks of questionable solvency. The loans became more abundant and for a much longer duration. Concerns grew that the central bank had stepped up to, or over, the line between acting as a lender of last resort and bailing out insolvent institutions that could not repay.

People feared that banks would fail, but they could not easily tell the difference between a strong bank and a weak one. People withdrew checking and saving deposits, but the run made it only more likely that banks would fail. Contagion and uncertainty meant that the panic hit all banks, weak and strong alike. Dollar deposits caused an additional problem. If people wanted to withdraw pesos, the central bank's peso loans helped, but if they wanted to withdraw dollars, the peso loans would head right back to the central bank as the commercial banks demanded dollar reserves to satisfy the dollar claims.

Even as people started to run from bank deposits to cash, higher interest rates and lower output depressed the demand for cash. Reserves drained, casting more doubt on the viability of the fixed exchange rate, raising the currency premium, and draining more reserves. Given the fears of a banking crisis and an exchange rate crisis, cash and bank deposits were switched into dollars and moved to banks in Montevideo (Uruguay), Miami, or other offshore locations. People were now starting to run from the currency too.

The consequences for the central bank balance sheet were dramatic. Domestic credit expanded from 4 billion pesos to 9 billion pesos in the first half of 1995, as seen in Figure 20-7 at point 4 in panel (a), even as base money supply remained more or less steady near 14 billion pesos. Cash demand held up, but people were moving bank deposits into pesos and then offshore—and the central bank was providing the peso liquidity (to banks) and then the dollar liquidity (to people) to allow this capital flight to happen. As a result of this sterilization, reserves fell to a low of just 5 billion pesos, with the backing ratio collapsing to a low of about  $ 36\% $  (5/14). In the central bank balance sheet diagram in Figure 20-7, panel (b), the country was now moving vertically up to point 4 and getting perilously close to the floating line, the dangerous place where reserves run out.

Help From the IMF and Recovery In late 1994 Argentina was at the point of being cut off from further official lending by the International Monetary Fund as a result of its failure to reduce its fiscal deficit and pursue other reforms. With private credit markets screeching toward a sudden stop after the Tequila crisis, and the government running a large deficit, the situation looked bleak.

However, after the Tequila crisis, the United States advanced a large assistance package to Mexico, and the IMF took a more lenient view of the Argentine situation, fearing the possibility of a global financial crisis if Argentina crashed too. IMF lending resumed. This was seen as "catalytic" in putting an end to the sudden stop, and a "Patriotic Bond" was issued in private capital markets. The loans provided desperately needed dollars. Some of the dollars could then be poured into the central bank. This replenished reserves, but it also revealed the scale of the bailing out. A substantial fund was set up to salvage insolvent commercial banks, a move that finally erased the stain of the bailouts from the central bank's balance sheet (bad commercial bank debt to the central bank was socialized and then turned into a government debt to foreigners).<sup>14</sup>

The Argentine authorities squeaked through a crisis, the economy recovered, capital flows resumed, and eventually the central bank's emergency loans were paid back. By 1996 economic growth had picked up, interest rate spreads eased, and confidence returned. The central bank reversed its earlier sterilization policies and replenished reserves by contracting domestic credit. By November 1996 domestic credit was back down to 4 billion pesos (its precrisis level), and by May 1997 the central bank had gone further and reduced domestic credit to zero. These steps are shown in the central bank balance sheet diagram in Figure 20-7, panel (b), by the moves from point 4 to point 5 to point 6.

Postscript Argentina's central bank ended up with a  $ 100\% $  backing ratio and was in a position to act as a strict currency board. However, it did not do so and in subsequent turbulent times continued to exercise discretion in its use of sterilization policies. The Convertibility Plan came to an end in 2001, however, when its room for maneuver finally ran out: the economy was in recession, the government was deeper in debt, the IMF and private creditors had reached their lending limits, and the government was reduced

to raiding the banks and the central bank for resources. The details of that story, which are tied up with the Argentine 2001 default, are taken up in the last chapter.

# The Central Bank Balance Sheet and the Financial System

We can see from the experiences of Argentina and many other countries that the existence of a financial system affects the operations and balance sheet of the central bank. In particular, whether as a result of its own policy choices, formal laws and regulations, or political pressure, the typical central bank takes on the responsibility for monitoring, regulating, and—in an emergency—protecting a country's commercial banking system.

A More General Balance Sheet As a result of its interactions with banks, the central bank's balance sheet is in reality more complicated than we have assumed in our simplified model. Typically, it looks something like this, with some hypothetical values inserted:15

GENERAL CENTRAL BANK BALANCE (MILLIONS OF PESOS)

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign assets</td><td>950</td><td>Foreign liabilities</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>of which:</td><td></td><td>of which:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Foreign reserves (all currencies)</td><td>950</td><td>Foreign currency debt issued by the central bank</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Gold</td><td>0</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Domestic assets</td><td>500</td><td>Domestic liabilities</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>of which:</td><td></td><td>of which:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Domestic government bonds bought</td><td>300</td><td>Domestic currency debt issued by the central bank</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>Loans to commercial banks</td><td>200</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Money supply M</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>of which:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Currency in circulation</td><td>900</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Reserve liabilities to commercial banks</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

In the first row, the central bank's net foreign assets are worth 900, given by 950 minus 50. We see that foreign assets can include other currencies besides the anchor currency (the dollar) and may also include gold. There may also be offsetting foreign liabilities if the central bank chooses to borrow. In this example, gold happens to be 0, foreign reserves are 950, and foreign liabilities are 50.

In the second row, net domestic assets are worth 100, 500 minus 400. We see that domestic assets may be broken down into government bonds (here, 300) and loans to commercial banks (here, 200). All of these assets can be offset by domestic liabilities, such as debt issued in home currency by the central bank. In this example, the central bank has issued 400 in domestic debt, which we shall assume was used to finance the purchase of foreign reserves.

Finally, the money supply is a liability for the central bank worth 1,000, as before. However, not all of that currency is "in circulation" (i.e., outside the central bank, in the hands of the public or in commercial bank vaults). Typically, central banks place reserve requirements on commercial banks and force them to place some cash on deposit at the central bank. This is considered a prudent regulatory device. In this case, currency in circulation is 900, and 100 is in the central bank as part of reserve requirements.

Despite all these refinements, the lessons of our simple model carry over. For example, in the simple approach, money supply  $ (M) $ equaled foreign assets $ (R) $ plus domestic assets $ (B) $ . We now see that, in general, money supply is equal to net foreign assets plus net domestic assets. The only real difference is the ability of the central bank to borrow by issuing nonmonetary liabilities, whether domestic or foreign.

Sterilization Bonds Why do central banks expand their balance sheets by issuing such liabilities? To see what the central bank can achieve by borrowing, consider what the preceding balance sheet would look like if the central bank had not borrowed to fund the purchase of reserves.

Without issuing domestic liabilities of 400 and foreign liabilities of 50, reserves would be lower by 450. In other words, they would fall from 950 to their original level of 500 seen in the example at the start of this chapter. Domestic credit would then be 500, as it was in that earlier example, with money supply of 1,000. Thus, what borrowing to buy reserves achieves is not a change in monetary policy (money supply and interest rates are unchanged, given the peg) but an increase in the backing ratio. Instead of a  $ 50\% $ backing ratio (500/1,000), the borrowing takes the central bank up to a $ 95\% $  backing ratio (950/1,000).

But why stop there? What if the central bank borrowed, say, another 300 by issuing domestic debt and used the proceeds to purchase more reserves? Its domestic liabilities would rise from 400 to 700 (net domestic assets would fall from  $ +100 $ to $ -200 $), and on the other side of the balance sheet, reserves (foreign assets) would rise from 950 to 1,250. Money supply would still be 1,000, but the backing ratio would be $ 125\% $. This could go on and on. Borrow another 250, and the backing ratio would be $ 150\% $ .

As we have seen, these hypothetical operations are all examples of changes in the composition of the money supply—in terms of net foreign assets and net domestic assets—holding fixed the level of money supply. In other words, this is just a more general form of sterilization. And sterilization is just a way to change the backing ratio, all else equal.

What is new here is that the central bank's net domestic assets (assets minus liabilities) can be less than zero because the central bank is now allowed to borrow. Many central banks do just this, by issuing bonds—or sterilization bonds as they are fittingly described. This allows the backing ratio to potentially exceed  $ 100\% $ .

Looking back at Figure 20-8, we could depict this by allowing reserves  $ R $ to represent net foreign assets, credit $ B $ to represent net domestic assets, and $ B $ to be less than zero. The key equation $ M = R + B $  still holds, and the fixed and floating lines work as before, as long as we interpret zero net foreign assets as the trigger for a switch from fixed to floating.[16] So we can imagine that the fixed line in Figure 20-8 can extend down below the horizontal axis.

Going below the horizontal axis means that net domestic credit is negative, and the backing ratio is more than  $ 100\% $. Why might countries want backing to be that high? As we saw, Argentina had high backing of more than $ 70\% $  on the eve of the Tequila crisis, but this would not have been enough for the peg to survive a major run from the financial system to dollars. In Figure 20-8, the zone below the horizontal axis would be an ultra-safe place, even farther from the floating line. Many countries have recently sought refuge in that direction (see Side Bar: The Great Reserve Accumulation in Emerging Markets).

# The Great Reserve Accumulation in Emerging Markets

An illustration of reserve buildup via sterilization is provided by the activities of the People's Bank of China, whose central bank balance sheet diagram is shown in Figure 20-10 in yuan (¥) units. The vertical distance to the 45-degree line represents net foreign assets  $ R $ , which were essentially the same as foreign reserves because the bank had close to zero foreign liabilities.*

From 1995 to 2003 net domestic credit in China grew very slowly, from ¥1,409 billion to ¥2,218 billion, but rapid economic growth and financial development caused base money demand to grow rapidly, more than doubling, from ¥2,076 billion to ¥5,284 billion. Thus, most of the base money supply growth of ¥3,208 billion was absorbed by ¥2,399 billion of reserve accumulation. In this period, the backing ratio rose from 32% to 58%.

From 2003 to 2009 net domestic credit fell by  $ 6,202 $ billion and eventually turned negative as the central bank sold large amounts of sterilization bonds. Money supply growth continued, rising from $ \ $ 5,284 \$ billion to $ \ $ 14,399 \$ billion, an increase of $ \ $ 9,115 \$ billion. But the sterilization caused reserves to rise by almost twice as much, by $ \ $ 15,317 \$ billion. The backing ratio rose from $ 58\% $ to $ 128\% $. In the years 2009 to 2012 sterilization was not in play, and both reserves and domestic credit increased together; by 2012 money supply was $ \ $ 25,235 \$ billion with $ 95\% $ backing in reserves of $ \ $ 23,928 \$ .

Given the country's economic (and political) importance, the Chinese case attracts a lot of attention—but it isn't the only example of this type of central bank behavior. Figure 20-11 shows the massive increase in reserves at central banks around the world in recent years: it started in about 1999, it mostly happened in Asia in countries pegging (more or less) to the dollar, and much of it was driven by large-scale sterilization. What was going on?

Sterilization in China By issuing "sterilization bonds" central banks can borrow from domestic residents to buy more reserves. With sufficient borrowing of this kind, the central bank can end up with negative net domestic credit and reserves in excess of  $ 100\% $ of the money supply. The chart shows how this has happened in China in some recent years: from 1995 to 2003 net domestic credit in China was steady; reserve growth was almost entirely driven by money demand growth (movement to the right). From 2003 to 2009 sterilization (movement down) sent net domestic credit below zero; sterilization accounted for about $ 40\% $ of the reserve growth in that period. In 2009-12, sterilization abated and the reserve ratio fell below $ 100\% $  for the first time in seven years.

# Causes of the Reserve Accumulation

Why are these countries, most of them poor emerging markets, accumulating massive hoards of reserves? There are various possible motivations for these reserve hoards, in addition to simply wanting greater backing ratios to absorb larger shocks to money demand.** For example, the countries may fear a sudden stop, when access to foreign capital markets dries up. Foreign creditors may cease to roll over short-term debt for a while, but if reserves are on hand, the central bank can temporarily cover the shortfall. This precautionary motive leads to policy guidelines or rules suggesting that an adequate and prudent level of reserves should be some multiple either of foreign trade or of short-term debt. In practice, such ratios usually imply reserve levels less than  $ 100\% $  of M0, the narrow money supply.

An alternative view, illustrated by the case of Argentina that we studied, would tend to focus on a different risk, the fragility of the financial sector. If there is a major banking crisis with a flight from local deposits to foreign banks, then a central bank may need a far greater level of reserves, adequate to cover some or all of M2, the broader measure of money that includes deposits and other liquid commercial bank liabilities. Because M2 can be several times M0, the reserve levels adequate for these purposes could be much larger and well over  $ 100\% $ of M0. Because reserves now far exceed traditional guidelines based on trade or debt levels, fears of financial fragility might be an important part of the explanation for the scale of the reserve buildup, with reserve backing in excess of $ 100\% $  of M0. As economist Martin Feldstein

pointed out after the Asian crisis, it is unrealistic to expect safe and crisis-free banking sector operations in emerging markets (in 2007 and 2008 we even saw bank runs in "developed countries" like the United Kingdom and the United States). But if countries are pegged, they then need to watch out for the peg: "... Sufficient liquidity, either through foreign currency reserves or access to foreign credit, would let a government restructure and recapitalize its banks without experiencing a currency crisis. The more international liquidity a government has, the less depositors will feel that they must rush to convert their currency before the reserves are depleted. And preventing a currency decline can be the best way to protect bank solvency."†

Thus, current reserve levels can be seen as a reaction, in part, to the financial crises of the recent past: policy makers have taken a "never again" stance, and have piled up a large war chest of reserves to guard against any risk of exchange rate crises. Is this wise? The benefits may seem clear, but many economists think this "insurance policy" carries too heavy an economic cost as countries invest in low-interest reserves and forsake investments with higher returns.

- In this period, foreign liabilities were just 1% of foreign assets.

Reserve Accumulation, 1997-2012 By the end of 2012, reserve holdings worldwide exceeded \(10,000 billion, more than five times their level in 1997. Most of the growth occurred in emerging markets, especially Asia. Much of these additional reserves were acquired through sterilization and have caused several countries' holdings of foreign exchange reserves to exceed \(100\%\) of the monetary base.

# Summary

In this section, we examined the constraints on the operations of the central bank when a fixed exchange rate is in operation. We focused on the central bank balance sheet, which in its simplest form describes how the narrow money supply (monetary base) is backed by foreign assets (reserves) and domestic assets (domestic credit). We have seen how, in response to money demand shocks, the central bank buys or sells reserves, to defend the peg. The central bank can also change the composition of the money supply through sterilization operations, which keep the money supply constant.

Two Types of Exchange Rate Crises When reserves go to zero, the country is floating, changes in domestic credit cause changes in the money supply, and the peg breaks. The central bank balance sheet diagrams in Figure 20-12 show two ways in which pegs can break:

In panel (a), in the first type of crisis, domestic credit is constantly expanding, so the central bank is pushed up the fixed line until reserves run out. At this point, the currency floats, the money supply then grows without limit, and, in the long run, the exchange rate depreciates.
In panel (b), in the second type of crisis, no long-run tendency exists for the money supply to grow, but there is a short-run temptation to expand the money supply temporarily, leading to a temporarily lower interest rate and a temporarily depreciated exchange rate.

Two Types of Exchange Rate Crisis In our model, using the central bank balance sheet diagram, we can see what actions will cause the peg to break. Two types of crisis are highlighted here. In panel (a), a permanent and ongoing expansion of domestic credit is incompatible with a fixed exchange rate regime because, sooner or later, reserves will be reduced to zero, and then the money supply starts to expand. In panel (b), a temporary expansion of domestic credit and the money supply will lower interest rates and depreciate the exchange rate, even if a reversal of this policy is expected in the future. Both policies take the country off the fixed line and onto the floating line.

In the next two sections, we develop models of these two types of crisis. Although the descriptions just given appear simple, a deeper examination reveals some peculiar features that illustrate the powerful role played by market expectations in triggering crises.

# 3 How Pegs Break I: Inconsistent Fiscal Policies

We begin with a so-called first-generation crisis model of inconsistent fiscal policies in a country with a fixed exchange rate, a model proposed by economist Paul Krugman.[17] This kind of crisis model has been successfully applied to many historical cases, including a series of Latin American crises in the 1980s.

# The Basic Problem: Fiscal Dominance

In this model, the level of output plays no role, so we assume output is fixed at some level  $ Y $. However, the price level $ P $  plays an important role, and we allow the price level to be flexible and determined by purchasing power parity (PPP), as in the chapter on the long-run monetary model. For now we keep all our earlier assumptions from this chapter.

In this model, the government is running a persistent deficit  $ DEF $ because of insufficient tax revenue, and the government's situation is so dire that it is unable to borrow from any creditor. It therefore turns to the central bank for financing. In this type of environment, economists speak of a situation of fiscal dominance in which the monetary authorities ultimately have no independence. The treasury hands over bonds in the amount $ DEF $ to the central bank, receives cash in the amount $ DEF $ in return, and uses the cash to fund the government deficit. As a result, domestic credit $ B $ increases by an amount $ \Delta B = DEF $ every period. For simplicity, we assume that domestic credit $ B $ is growing at a constant positive rate, $ \Delta B / B = \mu $. For example, if $ \mu = 0.1 $, then domestic credit $ B $ is growing at $ 10\% $  per period.

Given our previous graphical analysis of the central bank balance sheet, we can see that the fixed exchange rate is doomed. As in Figure 20-12, panel (a), every change in the level of domestic credit leads to an equal and opposite change in the level of reserves. This process can't go on forever because reserves must eventually run out. At that point, the peg breaks and the central bank shifts from a fixed exchange rate regime to a floating regime, in which the money supply equals domestic credit,  $ M = B $ . We note a key point:

Once reserves run out, the money supply  $ M $, which was previously fixed, grows at the same rate as domestic credit, $ \Delta M / M = \Delta B / B = \mu $ .

The reason the peg breaks in this situation is simple. There is an inconsistency between the authorities' commitment to a monetary policy of a fixed exchange rate and a fiscal policy of continuously monetizing deficits through an endless expansion of domestic credit. On the face of it, crisis results from elementary incompetence on the part of the authorities; to be more generous, we might say that the crisis happens because authorities are willing to let it happen because of overriding fiscal priorities.

# A Simple Model

In many ways, this situation is familiar. We have already seen the implications of long-run money growth. In the chapter on exchange rates in the long run, we learned what

happens in response to an unexpected increase in the rate of money supply growth: if prices can adjust flexibly, then, after the increase, the economy ends up with all nominal values growing at the rate  $ \mu $, the rate of growth of domestic credit. There will be inflation as prices $ P $ rise at a rate $ \mu $, and depreciation as the exchange rate $ E $ rises at a rate $ \mu $ .

The Myopic Case Figure 14-14 (p. 508) described a case in which the rate of growth of the money supply unexpectedly increased by a fixed amount. We apply the same analysis here and assume that investors are myopic and do not see the crisis coming. (To be more realistic, we relax this assumption in a moment, but the myopic case provides useful insights.)

Drawing on what we know, Figure 20-13 describes this kind of crisis scenario, assuming that prices are stable in the foreign country, that the foreign interest rate is  $ i^{*} = 5\% $, and that all variables change continuously through time. For simplicity, we start with $ M = P = E = 1 $, and at all times we assume the foreign price level is 1, $ P^{*} = 1 $ .

Starting at time 1, in the fixed regime, domestic credit is less than the money supply,  $ B < M $, and reserves are positive, $ R > 0 $. But because of the monetization of deficits, $ B $ is gradually rising, and, as a result, $ R $ is steadily falling. Eventually, reserves run out, and thereafter $ B = M $ and $ R = 0 $. We assume for now that the regime change occurs at time 4. In the fixed regime, up to that point, money supply $ M $ is fixed, but when floating starts, $ M $ grows at a rate $ \mu $  as shown in panel (a).

Because prices are flexible, the monetary model of exchange rates in the long run tells us that  $ P $ will be fixed until time 4 and then it will grow at a rate $ \mu $. Thus, inflation rises by an amount $ \mu $ at time 4. The Fisher effect tells us that an increase in the home inflation rate causes a one-for-one increase in the home interest rate. So the home interest rate $ i $ must rise by an amount $ \mu $  as we move from the fixed to the floating regime as shown in panel (b).

An increase in the home interest rate  $ i $ at time 4 lowers the demand for real money balances, $ M / P = L(i)Y $, because in the money demand function, $ L $ is a decreasing function of $ i $. Thus, $ M / P $ "jumps" down as we change from fixed to floating. Because the money supply $ M $ does not change at time 4, the drop in $ M / P $ can be accommodated only by a jump in the flexible price level $ P $ at time 4. Because, by assumption, PPP holds continuously (and because $ P^* = 1 $), then we can just compute $ E = P / P^* = P $. So the discontinuous rise in $ P $ also implies a discontinuous rise in $ E $ at time 4, and a depreciation of the home currency. Both $ E $ and $ P $ jump up and start to grow at rate $ \mu $  at time 4, as shown in panel (c).

To sum up, in Figure 20-13, the exchange rate crisis occurs at time 4, but the exchange rate doesn't drift continuously away from its previous fixed level. It jumps away discontinuously. The new floating path of the exchange rate rises at a growth rate  $ \mu $ , which is above the old fixed rate at time 4.

For example, if the money growth rate is  $ 10\% $ after the crisis, as assumed, then there is a 10 percentage point increase in the interest rate from $ 5\% $ to $ 15\% $. Now suppose this reduces real money demand by $ 20\% $, from 1.00 to 0.80. Because the nominal money supply $ M $ equals 1 just before and just after the crisis, it does not jump at time 4. To get $ M / P $ to fall from 1.00 to 0.80, $ P $ must jump up, from 1.0 to $ (1 / 0.80) = 1.25 $, implying an instantaneous $ 25\% $ increase in $ P $. To maintain purchasing power parity, there must also be a $ 25\% $ increase in the exchange rate $ E $, to 1.25, followed by growth at $ 10\% $ .

One significant implication of the jump in nominal values is that anyone holding a peso that was worth 1 dollar will suddenly be left holding a peso that is worth only  $ 1/1.25 = 0.80 $  dollar. Investors holding pesos at the moment of crisis will suffer a capital loss (in dollar terms) if this model accurately describes their behavior.

(c) Price Level and Exchange Rate (with myopia)

An Exchange Rate Crisis Due to Inconsistent Fiscal Policies: Myopic Case In the fixed regime, money supply  $ M $ is fixed, but expansion of domestic credit $ B $ implies that reserves $ R $ are falling to zero. Suppose the switch to floating occurs when reserves run out at time 4. Thereafter, the monetary model tells us that $ M $, $ P $, and $ E $ will all grow at a constant rate (here, $ 10\% $ per period). The expected rates of inflation and depreciation are now positive, and the Fisher effect tells us that the interest rate must jump up at period 4 (by 10 percentage points). The interest rate increase means that real money demand $ M / P = L(i)Y $ falls instantly at time 4. The money supply does not adjust immediately, so this jump in $ M / P $ must be accommodated by a jump in prices $ P $. To maintain purchasing power parity, $ E $  must also jump at the same time. Hence, myopic investors face a capital loss on pesos at time 4.

The Forward-Looking Case There is good reason to believe that investors will not be as shortsighted (myopic) as we have just assumed. It is usually well known when a government has a deficit that is being monetized, even if the authorities try to conceal the problem.

Let us move to the other extreme, forward-looking behavior, which for now we take to mean perfect foresight. Figure 20-14 explains how this scenario departs from the myopic version we just saw in Figure 20-13. Suppose peso holders see that domestic credit is rising and reserves are falling. Knowledgeable people will speculate that the fixed rate is going to break in the near future. They will expect pesos to suddenly lose their dollar value if they hold them until the bitter end at time 4 when reserves would run out under myopia. They will therefore decide to dump pesos sooner. But when? And how?

When investors sell all their holdings of a particular currency, it is known as a speculative attack. When such an attack occurs, the economy must immediately switch to the floating regime we have already studied, since once it has zero reserves, the money supply  $ M $ will always equal domestic credit $ B $ —which has been and will be growing at the constant rate $ \mu $ . At that same time, the nominal interest rate will also jump up, when the Fisher effect kicks in, and there will be a jump down in both money demand (as the interest rise hits) and in money supply (as the attack drains all remaining reserves).

In our example, the key lesson is that once an attack occurs, the economy completely switches over to the floating regime. Under myopia the switch occurred at time 4. But now, the switch happens well before time 4, and at the time of the attack the economy's inflation, exchange rates, prices, and interest rates all jump to their new (and rising) paths. This leaves one question: When does the speculative attack occur? From Figure 20-14, the answer must be at time 2. In this case, the path of the price level  $ P $ and the exchange rate $ E $  are continuous as we switch from fixed to floating. Only then can the switch occur without any expected dollar gains or losses on holding pesos.

How does this pin down the attack at time 2? Suppose the attack were at any time later than 2, such as time 3. As we can see from the diagram, this requires a jump up in the exchange rate, a discontinuous depreciation. If peso holders wait to attack until time 3, they still suffer a capital loss because they have waited too long. What if the attack is before time 2, say, at time 1? An attack at time 1 implies a discontinuous appreciation of the peso. But if that happened, any individual peso holder would enjoy capital gains (in dollars) from holding on to pesos rather than exchanging them for reserves at the central bank at the prior fixed rate. They would rather wait, let everyone else attack, and pocket the gains. But if one person thinks like that, all do, and the attack cannot materialize.

The speculative attack model teaches an important lesson. One moment, a central bank may have a pile of reserves on hand, draining away fairly slowly, giving the illusion that there is no imminent danger. The next moment, the reserves are all gone. The model can therefore explain why fixed exchange rates sometimes witness a sudden collapse rather than a long, lingering death.

# Application

# The Peruvian Crisis of 1986

An example of a crisis driven by inconsistent fiscal policies and excessive expansion of domestic credit is provided by the events in Peru from 1985 to 1986, illustrated in Figure 20-15.

In the early 1980s, Peru's political and economic conditions were highly unfavorable. The country had endured a period of social unrest and military rule in the 1970s, and the government had an enormous external debt burden. World commodity prices fell, exports and economic growth slowed, and government deficits grew. At the same time, world interest rates sharply increased.

An Exchange Rate Crisis Due to Inconsistent Fiscal Policies: Perfect-Foresight Case Compare this figure with Figure 20-13. If investors anticipate a crisis, they will seek to avoid losses by converting the pesos they are holding to dollars before period 4. The rational moment to attack is at time 2, the point at which the switch from fixed to floating is achieved without any jumps in  $ E $ or $ P $ . Why? At time 2, the drop in money demand (due to the rise in the interest rate) exactly equals the decline in the money supply (the reserve loss), and money market equilibrium is maintained without the price level having to change.

A Crisis in Peru: The Inconsistent Policies of the Garcia Administration From 1985 to 1986 the Peruvian government implemented a fixed exchange rate regime, but government budget problems required significant monetization of budget deficits. Monetary and fiscal policies were inconsistent: a peg was in place, but domestic credit grew exponentially (note that the exchange rate and domestic credit are shown on logarithmic scales). The central bank lost three-quarters of its reserves in two years, and the peg had to be abandoned.
Source: IMF, International Financial Statistics.

The Peruvian government defaulted on its debt obligations and began negotiations with the IMF and other creditors. Denied fresh loans from world capital markets, and with low tax receipts that could not cover rising spending, government financing came to rely on money printing by the central bank—that is, the inflation tax. Domestic credit grew by  $ 65\% $ in 1982, $ 165\% $ in 1983, and $ 93\% $  in 1984—a rough doubling every year, on average. The dollar value of Peru's currency, the sol, rapidly sank.

As economic conditions deteriorated further and political violence by guerilla groups intensified, President Alan García Pérez was elected to office in 1985. One important economic measure he instituted immediately was a fixed exchange rate. This stopped the depreciation and was intended to give Peru a firm nominal anchor. But, as we now know, its durability would depend on whether García's administration could solve its fiscal problems and put an end to the monetization of government deficits.

Some fiscal reform was attempted, and the economy recovered slightly: the government budget improved at first. But the administration could not get the government budget out of the red for long. The deficit fell from  $ 2\% $ to $ 3\% $ of GDP to near zero in early 1986, but by mid-1986 it was growing again, averaging over $ 5\% $ and peaking at $ 8\% $ to $ 9\% $ of GDP in late 1986 and 1987. The printing presses of the central bank kept running, and domestic credit grew $ 84\% $ in 1985, $ 77\% $ in 1986, and $ 146\% $  in 1987—roughly doubling every year.

Under a fixed exchange rate, something had to give. With domestic credit exploding, the central bank was continually selling reserves to defend the peg.[18] Reserves fell from a peak of \(2,000 million in early 1986 to \)500 million in early 1988. The authorities gave up in April 1988 before the attack was complete and so avoided losing all their dollar reserves. The sol began to float and depreciation was rapid: the sol hit 250,000 sol/\( in September, 500,000 in November, and 1,200,000 by March 1989, and Peru was heading into a hyperinflation.[19]

The data closely match the predictions of the model. Under the peg, reserves drain as domestic credit grows, and the exchange rate is stable. Under the float, reserves are stable, and the exchange rate grows as domestic credit expands.

By the time García left office, Peru was in economic shambles. García's popularity sank. The 1990 presidential election was won by a political newcomer, Alberto Fujimori, who would struggle with the problems created by his predecessor (and problems of his own). Yet, remarkably, in 2006 Alan García Pérez was elected president of Peru for a second time. Twenty years is a long time in politics.

Expectations and the Critical Level of Reserves What determines the critical level of reserves  $ R_{c} $ at which the crisis occurs? In the speculative attack model, the size of the sudden reserve loss, and hence the timing of the crisis, depend critically on market expectations about the future growth rate of domestic credit. The reserves $ R_{c} $  lost at the moment of crisis will depend on how much money investors want to convert into reserves when they attack. This, in turn, depends on how much money demand shrinks as we move from fixed to floating, and that is driven by the change in the interest rate.

Let's assume that each percentage point increase in the interest rate causes a  $ \phi \% $ fall in real money balances.[20] At the moment of attack, the interest rate rises by an amount $ \Delta i = \mu $, so the proportional fall in money demand is given by $ \phi $ times that change. Thus, the change in money demand is given by $ -\Delta M / M = \phi \times \mu $ .

But we also know that the change in the money supply at the moment of attack  $ -\Delta M $ has to correspond exactly to the size of the reserve drain at the moment of attack, which equals the critical level of reserves $ R_{c} $ that are lost at that instant. Thus, $ $

\begin{array}{c c} \frac {R _ {c}}{M} = & \frac {- \Delta M}{M} \\ \text {C r i t i c a l b a c k i n g r a t i o} & \\ \text {w h e n a c t a c k o c c u r s} & \end{array} \qquad \begin{array}{c c} = & \underbrace {\phi} _ {\text {R e s p o n s i v e n e s s}} \times \\ & \text {o f m o n e y d e m a n d} \\ & \text {t o i n t e r i s t r a t e c h a n g e s} \end{array} \qquad \begin{array}{c c} \underset {\text {F u t u r e}} {\mu} \\ \text {r a t e o f g r o w t h o f} \\ \text {d o m e s t i c c r e d i t} \end{array}

$ $
This expression tells us the ratio of the critical level of reserves  $ R_{c} $ to the money supply $ M $. It depends on the sensitivity of money demand to the interest rate and on the expected future rate of growth of domestic credit $ \mu $  (remember, investors are forward-looking).

To illustrate, and continue our previous example, if the growth rate of domestic credit is expected to be  $ \mu = 10\% $, and if $ \phi = 1.5 $, then the fall in money demand and money supply at the moment of attack is $ 10\% $ times 1.5, or $ 15\% $. Thus, when reserves have drained so far that the backing ratio falls to the critical level $ R_{c} = 15\% $, the peg will break. But if $ \mu $ rises to $ 20\% $, the critical level $ R_{c} $ would be twice as large, $ 30\% $ .

We can now see that if people expect a fiscal problem to worsen (expect the deficit to increase, and thus domestic credit to grow faster to finance it), then reserves drain away faster, and the crisis hits sooner, at a higher critical level of reserves  $ R_{c} $ . Thus, an increase in the expected rate of deficit monetization shortens the length of time that the peg will survive.

This result emphasizes the importance of market beliefs. Suppose a country has reserves well above the critical level. There is no imminent crisis. Then market beliefs change, perhaps because news or rumors emerge about a budget problem. Investors now expect a higher growth rate of domestic credit. Suppose that, as a result of this change in expectations, the critical level of reserves rises so much as to equal the current level of reserves. With the change in expectations, the time for a speculative attack is now. A crisis will happen immediately, even though there has been no change in the economic situation as of today!

# Summary

The first-generation crisis model tells us that inconsistent fiscal policies can destroy a fixed exchange rate. Yet it is not actual fiscal policy that matters, but beliefs and expectations about future fiscal policy. Because beliefs about future deficits may or may not be justified, the model opens up the possibility that countries will be punished for crimes they do not intend to commit.

For example, some economists have argued that expected future deficits were a factor in the Asian currency crisis of 1997: the countries were affected by "crony capitalism" and the banking sectors were insolvent because of bad loans to insiders. Once the scale of these problems became known, investors believed that the monetary authorities would bail out the banks. Fears of a rapid future expansion of domestic credit thus undermined the pegs.[21]

# 4 How Pegs Break Ii:

# Contingent Monetary Policies

In the previous section, we found that inconsistent fiscal policies under a fixed exchange rate regime eventually cause an exchange rate crisis. However, the crises of the 1990s often did not conform to a model based on deficit monetization because budget problems were absent in many cases. In particular, the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) crisis of 1992 affected developed countries in Europe, most of which were unlikely to monetize deficits. In countries with apparently sound economic policies, foreign currency speculators went for the attack and pegs broke.[22]

Economists therefore developed alternative models of crises, with the pioneering work on the second-generation crisis model being done by Maurice Obstfeld. These types of models can explain how, even when policy making is rational and purposeful—rather than incompetent and inconsistent—there may still be situations in which pegs break for no apparent reason.[23]

# The Basic Problem: Contingent Commitment

The essence of the model is that policy makers are not committed to the peg under all circumstances. Defending the peg is therefore a contingent commitment (a slight oxymoron): if things get "bad enough," the government will let the exchange rate float rather than put the country through serious economic pain. The problem is that everyone—especially, investors in the forex market—knows this and will adjust their expectations accordingly.

To develop some intuition, we return to Britain and Germany in 1992, the example we saw at the start of the previous chapter when we studied fixed and floating regimes. Let's recap the basic story: the German central bank raised interest rates to deal with a domestic shock, the fiscal expansion arising from German unification after 1989. This left Britain with a higher interest rate and a lower output level than it wanted. What would Britain do in response?

If German interest rates are fairly low, so too are British interest rates, output costs in Britain are low, and nobody expects Britain to leave the peg. The peg is credible. But if German interest rates rise to high levels, output in Britain falls to an intolerably low level, and nobody expects Britain to stay on the peg for long. Instead, everyone thinks Britain will float and use expansionary monetary policy to boost output and depreciate the pound. The peg is not credible, and the market now expects a depreciation in the future.

The problem for Britain is that an expected depreciation will introduce a currency premium, as we saw earlier in this chapter. Investors will demand even higher interest rates in Britain to compensate for the imminent depreciation—and this will mean even lower output and even higher pain for Britain!

This creates a gray area. How? It is quite possible that the German interest rate can be at some "intermediate" level at which pegging is tolerable with no expected depreciation: people would expect the peg to hold and the peg would hold. But if there is an expected depreciation and a currency premium, pegging might be intolerable: people would expect the peg to fail and the peg would fail. Crucially, in both scenarios, ex ante market expectations are validated ex post, and hence would be considered "rational."

(b) Large Recession, Peg Credible

Based on these insights from the Britain-Germany example, we now develop an economic model with such self-fulfilling expectations. In this model we may not always find a single, unique equilibrium but rather multiple equilibria. Whether there is a crisis depends entirely on market sentiment, and not simply economic fundamentals.

# A Simple Model

In this type of model, we need a measure of the cost of maintaining the peg. The simplest cost measure is the deviation of output  $ Y $ in the short run below its full employment level. To allow output to vary, we need to use the IS-LM-FX model introduced in the chapter on macroeconomic policy, which means that we reverse some of the assumptions we made before. From now on, output $ Y $  will be variable rather than fixed, and it will be determined by the model. And from now on, prices will be sticky, not flexible, and treated as given.[24]

(c) Large Recession, Peg Not Credible

Contingent Commitments and the Cost of Maintaining a Peg This figure describes how the IS-LM-FX equilibrium changes as demand shocks occur and as the credibility of the peg weakens. The economy is pegging at a fixed exchange rate  $ \overline{E} $. In panel (a), the economy is at IS-LM equilibrium at point 1, with the FX market at point $ 1' $. Output is a little below desired output, so the cost of pegging $ c_{1} $ is small. In panel (b), there is an adverse shock to domestic demand, and the IS curve shifts in. LM shifts in, too, to maintain the peg. The new IS-LM equilibrium occurs at point 2, with FX market equilibrium at point $ 2' $ (same as $ 1' $). The cost of pegging $ c_{2} $ is higher. Panel (c) shows that if the country wants to attain full employment output next period, it must move to point 4, shifting the LM curve out and allowing the FX market to settle at point $ 4' $ with the exchange rate depreciating to $ E_{\mathrm{float}} $. The peg would still be in operation today, but, by definition, it would no longer be credible if such a policy change were anticipated. Because of the lack of credibility, investors would insist on receiving a positive currency premium today, and the home interest rate would rise to $ i_{3} $, squeezing demand even more and moving the IS-LM equilibrium to point 3 and the FX market to point $ 3' $. Now the cost of pegging $ c_{3} $  is even higher: having a noncredible peg is more costly than having a credible peg.

For simplicity, we assume there are some benefits from pegging, say, the gains from increased trade. Let these benefits be  $ b > 0 $ and constant. Against the benefits of pegging, the government weighs costs $ c $ that equal the "output gap": full-employment $ \overline{Y} $ output minus current output $ Y $ . If costs exceed benefits, we assume that the government will elect to float next period and use monetary policy to restore full employment output. For simplicity, we assume each period lasts one year. (Restricting attention to this type of rule keeps things simple while illustrating the key trade-offs.)

In Figure 20-16, we use the home IS-LM-FX diagram to look at how outcomes under the peg can depend on both economic fundamentals and market expectations. We assume foreign output is fixed at  $ Y^{*} $ , and we also assume there is no fiscal policy change, so we can focus only on home monetary policy choices. Most important, we assume that investors are aware of the contingent commitment to the peg.

In this setup, it does not matter where adverse output shocks originate. They could result from increases in the foreign interest rate (as in the ERM example). Or they could be caused by a decline in the demand for home goods overseas. All that matters is that the home economy is in some kind of pain with output below the desired level.

Small Recession, Peg Credible Panel (a) shows a situation in which the pain is small. Initially, the  $ IS_{1} $ and $ LM_{1} $ curves intersect at equilibrium point 1, and the home interest rate is $ i_{1} = i^{*} $ to maintain the peg. In the FX diagram, the domestic return is $ DR_{1} $ and the foreign return $ FR_{1} $. They intersect at point $ 1' $ and the exchange rate is fixed at $ E_{1} = \overline{E} $. Home output is at $ Y_{1} $, but we assume that the desired full employment level of home output is $ \overline{Y} $, slightly higher than $ Y_{1} $. In this situation, when the peg is credible, the economy suffers a small cost given by the "output gap": $ c_{1} = \overline{Y} - Y_{1} $ .

Large Recession, Peg Credible Panel (b) shows a situation in which the adverse shock to output is large. The  $ IS_{2} $ and $ LM_{2} $ curves now intersect at equilibrium point 2. The IS curve has moved left by assumption: it is the source of the adverse shock. The LM curve has moved in to maintain the peg and preserve interest parity, so that the home interest rate remains at $ i_{1} = i^{*} $. In the FX diagram, the domestic return is still $ DR_{1} $ and the foreign return is still $ FR_{1} $, and they intersect at point $ 2' $, the same as point $ 1' $, with $ E_{1} = \overline{E} $. Home output is now much lower at $ Y_{2} $. Here, the economy suffers an even larger cost given by the "output gap": $ c_{2} = \overline{Y} - Y_{2} $ .

We obtain our first important result: if the market believes that the peg is credible, the output gap (cost) increases as the size of the adverse shock increases.

Large Recession, Peg Not Credible This is the most complex situation. Panel (c) assumes a large recession as in panel (b), but shows what happens if investors believe that the authorities will choose to depreciate next year to achieve desired output. We suppose exchange rate expectations are unchanged next year at the pegged rate. The IS curve will still be at  $ IS_2 $, and the required monetary expansion next year will shift the LM curve to $ LM_4 $ so that the new equilibrium will be at point 4 with output at the desired level $ \overline{Y} $, and a low interest rate of $ i_{4} $. This will lead to a temporary depreciation next year, the peg will break, and the exchange rate will rise from $ \overline{E} $ to $ E_{\mathrm{float}} $. We can also see that to achieve full employment output, the lower that $ Y_{2} $  is, the larger the required shift in the LM curve will be next year and the larger the resulting depreciation.

However, the government's response next year will be anticipated by investors. If they know that output is low enough to prompt a depreciation, they will expect a depreciation over the coming year of a size given by  $ \Delta E^{e} / \overline{E} = (E_{\mathrm{float}} - \overline{E}) / \overline{E} > 0 $. This expected depreciation will appear today as a currency premium in the FX market of panel (c). The current period's risk-adjusted foreign return curve shifts up to $ FR_{2} $  by an amount equal to the currency premium.

If the central bank wants to maintain the peg, even though it is not credible, it has to ensure forex market equilibrium at point  $ 3' $, so it must raise the home interest rate to $ i_{3} $. At today's pegged rate $ \overline{E} $, uncovered interest parity now requires a higher home interest rate $ i_{3} = i^* + \Delta E^e / \overline{E} $. Graphically, this means the domestic return curve must also shift up (to $ DR_2 $ ) by an amount equal to the currency premium.

As we know from the earlier chapters on policy and regimes, this shift will depress home demand and lead to even lower home output today, which is shown at  $ Y_{3} $ .

In more detail, today the IS curve moves out slightly to  $ IS_{3} $ due to expected depreciation, but the LM curve moves in a long way to $ LM_{3} $  to defend the peg. The latter effect dominates, because we know that demand and output have to be lower today given the combination of the same exchange rate (no change in the trade balance) and a higher interest rate (lower investment demand). So the new IS-LM equilibrium is at point 3, to the left of point 2.

We also note that to achieve this monetary contraction, the central bank must sell reserves—and the drain can take the form of a speculative attack if the currency premium appears suddenly as a result of a switch in beliefs.

The loss of credibility makes a bad recession even worse. If the peg is not credible, a higher interest rate causes the costs of pegging to rise to  $ c_{3} = \overline{Y} - Y_{3} $ . Finally, we note that this cost will be higher when the output gap is higher, because a larger output gap implies a larger depreciation to restore full employment.

Our second important result: if the forex market switches to believing that the peg is not credible, then reserves drain, the interest rate rises, and the output gap (cost) increases; also, the cost increases more if the output gap is larger to begin with.

The Costs and Benefits of Pegging Our IS-LM-FX analysis is now complete, and all we need to do is consider the implications.

Figure 20-17 sums up the cost-benefit analysis. The horizontal axis measures the output gap, or the cost of pegging, when the peg is credible. We denote these costs  $ c(\overline{E}) $. This notation indicates that this is the cost $ c $  when the exchange rate is expected to be

FIGURE 20-17

# Contingent Policies And

# Multiple Equilibria Building

on Figure 20-16, this figure shows how the costs of pegging depend on whether the peg is credible, and how that affects the game between the authorities and investors. The costs of pegging when the peg is credible are shown on the horizontal axis. To measure these costs on the vertical axis, we can read off from the 45-degree line. We know that the costs of pegging when the peg is not credible will be even higher. Costs rise when investors do not believe in the peg. We assume the government believes the benefits of pegging (e.g., lower trade costs) are fixed and equal to  $ b $ . In this world, the peg is always credible in Zone I, where benefits always exceed costs: the government never wants to depreciate and investors know it. The peg is always noncredible in Zone III, where costs always exceed benefits: the government always wants to depreciate and investors know it. Zone II is the gray area: if investors believe the peg is credible, costs are low and the peg will hold; if investors believe the peg is noncredible, costs are higher and the peg will break.

at  $ \overline{E} $  next period. The first of our results showed that this cost rises, and we move right along the horizontal axis, whenever the country suffers an adverse shock under the peg.

The vertical axis measures and compares the costs and benefits of pegging. Benefits are constant at  $ b $. The costs when the peg is credible are equal to $ c(\overline{E}) $ so these will fall on the 45-degree line, since $ c(\overline{E}) $  is measured on the horizontal axis.

Finally, the cost of pegging when the peg is not credible is denoted  $ c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) $. This notation indicates that this is the cost $ c $ when the exchange rate is expected to be at $ E_{\mathrm{float}} $  next period.

The second of our results showed that the costs of pegging when the peg is not credible are always greater than the costs when the peg is credible, due to the rise in the currency premium associated with an expected depreciation. In other words, the  $ c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) $ line is above the $ c(\overline{E}) $ line, as shown. We also saw that the difference gets larger as the costs grow larger. In Figure 20-17, this means that the $ c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) $ curve diverges from the $ c(\overline{E}) $  curve, as shown.

Corresponding to the previous analysis in Figure 20-16, point 1 (cost  $ c_{1} $) represents a small recession with a credible peg; point 2 (cost $ c_{2} $) represents a large recession with a credible peg; point 3 (cost $ c_{3} $ ) represents the same large recession with a noncredible peg.

With this basic apparatus, we can now analyze the "game" between the authorities and investors. To keep it simple, we suppose investors can choose from two beliefs about what the government will do: {peg, depreciate}. And we suppose the authorities then choose from two actions: {peg, depreciate}. Faced with this type of problem, economists search for what might be considered a rational outcome of the game. We look for a self-confirming equilibrium, that is, combinations of investor beliefs and government actions for which the ex post outcome validates the ex ante beliefs.

We can identify several such equilibria using Figure 20-17:

In Zone I,  $ b > c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) > c(\overline{E}) $, so the benefits $ b $ of pegging always outweigh both kinds of costs, no matter what the market believes. The authorities will always choose to "peg." Anticipating this, the market belief will also be peg, and this is the only ex ante belief that will be validated ex post. Benefits are always given by $ b $, and costs are always those of a credible peg $ c(\overline{E}) $. There is a unique self-confirming equilibrium: peg, with costs corresponding to the solid portion of the line $ c(\overline{E}) $ . (Example: point 1.)
In Zone III,  $ c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) > c(\overline{E}) > b $, so both kinds of costs of pegging always outweigh the benefits $ b $, no matter what the market believes. The authorities will always choose to "depreciate." Anticipating this, the market belief will also be depreciate, and this is the only ex ante belief that will be validated ex post. Benefits are then always given by $ b $, and the costs are always those of a noncredible peg $ c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) $. There is a unique self-confirming equilibrium: depreciate, with costs corresponding to the solid portion of the line $ c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) $ . (Example: point 5.)
In Zone II,  $ c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) > b > c(\overline{E}) $. If the market belief is "depreciate," then the benefits $ b $ of pegging are less than the costs of the noncredible peg $ c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) $; authorities will then choose depreciate, and market beliefs are validated for this case. Conversely, if the market belief is peg, then the benefits $ b $ of pegging are greater than the costs of a credible peg $ c(\overline{E}) $ ; authorities will then choose peg, and the market beliefs are also validated for this case. There are two self-confirming equilibria in this zone. Zone II is shown as a gray area in the diagram. And appropriately so! In this range, there is no unique equilibrium,

and depending on market beliefs, costs may correspond to the solid portions of either line  $ c(\overline{E}) $ or line $ c(E_{\mathrm{float}}) $ . (Examples: points 2 and 3.)

# Application

# The Man Who Broke the Bank of England

Our analysis of contingent policies is highly simplified but advances our understanding of the potential for capricious outcomes driven by shifts in market sentiment. Changes in market sentiment, often called "animal spirits," emerge here from a model based on rational actors.

In some circumstances, the instability problem is much worse than we have suggested, for a couple of reasons. First, we have assumed that the government does not exit the peg immediately when it suffers pain, so expectations of depreciation are slow. If a  $ 10\% $ devaluation is feared in one year, this causes a $ 10\% $ currency premium. But if it is expected to happen in three months (next quarter), then the expected rate of depreciation on an annualized basis is much higher and is given by a fourfold compounding of a $ 10\% $ increase: this is $ 46\% $ (because 1.10 to the power 4 equals 1.46). So the currency premium would be approximately $ 46\% $, a heavy penalty. If the $ 10\% $ devaluation were expected in one month, the premium would be more than $ 200\% $  on an annualized basis.[25] As the time frame shrinks, the currency premium explodes!

For example, in 1992 Swedish interest rates climbed astronomically as investors speculated on the imminent demise of the krona's peg to the German mark. The annualized short-term (overnight) lending rate climbed to  $ 75\% $ on September 8 and $ 500\% $  on September 19. Such an interest rate was not politically tenable for very long. Investors knew this, and they were proved right.

A second issue is how beliefs form in the first place. Suppose we are in Zone II at the "no crisis" self-confirming equilibrium, with beliefs and actions corresponding to "peg." A mass switch in beliefs to "depreciate" would also be a self-confirming equilibrium. How does the market end up in one equilibrium or the other?

If traders are a group of many individuals, spread diffusely throughout the market, then it is unclear how they could all suddenly coordinate a switch to a new set of beliefs. And if each trader can place only a small bet, then it would be irrational for any trader to switch beliefs—unless all traders switch, and without coordination the switch is not going to happen and the peg stands a chance of holding.

But what if there are only a few traders? Or even just one very large trader who can make very big bets? If that single trader changes beliefs, the entire market goes from believing "peg" (no bets) to believing "depreciate" (making as big a bet against the home currency as possible). The coordination problem is solved. This is illustrated by the British ERM crisis of 1992. The large trader was the Quantum Fund, owned

George Soros: "Reflexivity is, in effect, a two-way feedback mechanism in which reality helps shape the participants' thinking and the participants' thinking helps shape reality."

by the famous (to some, infamous) investor George Soros, who likes to use the term "reflexivity" to describe how markets shape events, as well as vice versa.

Soros's firm placed one big bet after another, until he had borrowed billions of pounds and parked all the money in German mark deposits. "It was an obvious bet, a one-way bet," he later recalled.[26] If the pound held, he could convert his marks back to pounds, having paid a small interest cost (the difference between pound and mark interest rates for a few days); if the peg broke, he made billions as the pound fell. And who sold him the marks in exchange for pounds? The Bank of England, under orders from the U.K. Treasury, was intervening furiously, selling marks to prop up the pound at the limits of the ERM band.

The sudden increase in the currency premium was inducing a massive reserve drain. On the morning of September 16, 1992, the pressure on the pound became intense. The government made a feeble defense, raising the Bank's interest rates too little, too late, from  $ 10\% $ to $ 12\% $ and, at the last gasp, to $ 15\% $ . Pessimistic investors were unimpressed. With bearish sentiment so strong, reserve outflow was unlikely to halt without stronger measures, such as the Swedes had taken the week before. But with the British economy performing weakly, the government had little stomach for triple-digit interest rates—something investors well knew.

It was all over by lunchtime, with the bulk of the reserves lost, and an estimated £4 billion spent in a futile defense. The event has gone down in history as one more legendary British exchange rate fiasco.

# Summary

Our results are striking. If government policies are contingent, then they will depend on market sentiment. But market sentiment, in turn, depends on what the market believes the government will do. If costs of pegging are "low," then pegs hold when they "should"—when the government has no desire to exit. If costs of pegging are "high," then crises happen when they "should"—when the government clearly wants to exit. But in between these extremes, an ambiguity arises in the form of multiple equilibria because for some "medium" range of costs, a crisis occurs if and only if the market expects a crisis.

# 5 Conclusions

Fixed exchange rates exhibit no signs of disappearing. Despite all their potential benefits, however, history shows another persistent feature—the recurrent crises that mark the collapse of fixed regimes.

In this chapter, we studied two kinds of crises. Adverse fiscal conditions can send the money supply out of control. And changes in the real economy can weaken the commitment to a peg. Expectations matter in each case—shifts in investor sentiment can make the crises occur “sooner” (i.e., when economic fundamentals are better), leading to worries that some crises are an unnecessary and undeserved punishment.

# Can We Prevent Crises?

With these insights, we can now confront the major policy problem: How can these crises be prevented? A number of solutions have been proposed that merit mention:

- The case for capital controls. Crises occur in the forex market when investors see an arbitrage opportunity in shifting from one currency to another. If a nation could shut down its forex market, the risk of a crisis occurring would be lower. However, experience shows that capital controls, which are used to limit or prevent cross-border arbitrage by investors, are hard to implement and never watertight.

Empirically, there seems to be no consistent evidence that capital controls work to decrease crisis frequency or enhance growth. In addition, countries tend to want to maintain financial openness as a way to obtain some of the economic gains described in the chapter on financial globalization. Controls could be instituted as a temporary policy, but, given the speed with which crises can unfold, the controls often end up taking effect after the reserves have disappeared. In a few countries (Malaysia after 1997, Spain after 1992), capital controls may have improved a crisis situation, but in many cases controls had only weak or negative effects.[27]

The case against intermediate regimes. One lesson of the models presented in this chapter is that a change in market expectations today can trigger "unnecessary" crises, with no deterioration today in economic fundamentals (e.g., GDP, inflation, etc.). After the experience of the 1990s, many leading economists began to see that intermediate regimes (such as dirty floats and soft pegs) are very risky when fluid market expectations are taken into account. Under such regimes, the extent of the authorities' commitment to the exchange rate target would be seen as questionable, meaning that departures from the target to monetize deficits or pursue monetary autonomy might be suspected, leading to potentially self-fulfilling crises. How can a nation avoid this outcome? In the trilemma diagram, countries should get out of the middle and move to the corners. This view came to be known as the corners hypothesis or the missing middle. Given the prevailing view that controls are not a viable option, this reduces the trilemma to a dilemma: in this "bipolar" view, only the two extremes of a hard peg or a true float can be recommended (an idea dating back to Milton Friedman, quoted at the start of this chapter). Evidence has mounted that intermediate regimes have been more crisis-prone in the past (up to five times as likely to have a crisis than a hard peg, according to one study), but the move away from such regimes appears to be very slow.[28]

27 See, for example, Sebastian Edwards and Jeffrey A. Frankel, eds., 2002, Preventing Currency Crises in Emerging Markets, National Bureau of Economic Research Conference Report (Chicago: University of Chicago Press); Sebastian Edwards, ed., 2007, Capital Controls and Capital Flows in Emerging Economies: Policies, Practices, and Consequences, National Bureau of Economic Research Conference Report (Chicago: University of Chicago Press); Reuven Glick, Xueyan Guo, and Michael Hutchison, 2006, "Currency Crises, Capital-Account Liberalization, and Selection Bias," Review of Economics and Statistics, 88(4), 698-714; Rawi Abdelal and Laura Alfaro, 2003, "Capital and Control: Lessons from Malaysia," Challenge, 46(4), 36-53. 28 After Friedman, the corners hypothesis gained new life in the 1990s and became influential in the minds of leading international economists and policy makers, such as Andrew Crockett, Barry Eichengreen, Stanley Fischer, and Lawrence Summers. For surveys of the intellectual history and arguments for and against the bipolar views, see Morris Goldstein, 2002, Managed Floating, Policy Analyses in International Economics, No. 66 (Washington, D.C.: Peterson Institute for International Economics); Thomas D. Willett, 2007, "Why the Middle Is Unstable: The Political Economy of Exchange Rate Regimes and Currency Crises," World Economy, 30(5), 709-732. On crisis frequency and evidence for a trend away from the middle, see Andrea Bubula and Inci Otker-Robe, The Continuing Bipolar Conundrum, IMF Finance and Development, March 2004. Evidence of no such trend is given by Kenneth Rogoff, Ashoka Mody, Nienke Oomes, Robin Brooks, and Aasim M. Husain, 2004, "Evolution and Performance of Exchange Rate Regimes," IMF Occasional Paper No. 229.

The case for floating. In a crisis, a peg breaks. If there isn't a peg, there is nothing to break. It might be desirable for all countries to float from that perspective. However, in the chapter on fixed and floating regimes, we saw that there are powerful reasons to peg, especially in emerging markets and developing countries with fear of floating. And empirically, there is no overwhelming trend toward floating regimes in recent years. Thus, the floating corner has not attracted all that many countries in practice.

The case for hard pegs. If floating is out, then the "bipolar view" suggests that (short of dollarizing) countries should go the other way and adopt a really hard peg like a currency board. Only a few countries have ever taken this route, including such examples as Hong Kong (still operative), Estonia (now in the euro), and Argentina (until its 2001-2002 crisis). Not all of these regimes were strict currency boards, but they could all be considered hard pegs, with high reserve ratios and some rules to try to limit domestic credit. Did they work? Some worked very well. Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority wasn't following the strict rules, the system has worked, and the massive reserves have kept the peg alive even in times of financial market turmoil. But hard pegs can also break like any other kind of government commitment, if the authorities deem it necessary, as they did in Argentina. Lesson: all fixed exchange rates can be broken, no matter how strong they appear to be.[29]

- The case for improving the institutions of macroeconomic policy and financial markets. If hard pegs are not a panacea, then risks to pegged regimes might be minimized if the rest of the macroeconomic and financial structure in a country could be endowed with greater strength, increased stability, and enhanced transparency. Admittedly, these goals are always desirable no matter what the exchange rate regime, but they take on added importance when a country is pegging because fiscal and banking problems have emerged as the root cause of so many crises. The steps involved may be slow, incremental, bureaucratic, and unglamorous. But their defenders would claim that, although they lack the "quick-fix" appearance of currency boards and other schemes, these improvements are the foundations on which any successful fixed exchange rate regime must be built.

The case for an international lender of last resort. We have seen that the adequate level of reserves to avert a crisis can depend on market sentiment. Why not borrow more reserves? This solution is not possible if lenders worry about an imminent crisis and you face a sudden stop. This is where the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can help. The IMF may lend to countries in difficulty if it thinks they can restore stability in a timely fashion with the help of a loan. But making the right judgments is far from easy. The IMF may impose unwelcome loan conditions that require policy change, including, for example, stricter control of budget deficits. If the conditions are ignored, the IMF may suspend the loan program. The IMF has also been criticized on occasion for being too hard (Korea in 1997) or too soft (Argentina in 2001). Moreover, its

capacity to lend is limited and is increasingly dwarfed by private capital flows, causing concerns that future attacks may be too large for any IMF program to contain. Not that larger rescue capacity is necessarily good—at a basic level, many worry that the prospect of IMF bailouts, like any kind of insurance, may encourage lax behavior (moral hazard), which could worsen the crisis problem. Not surprisingly, the role of the IMF has been constantly questioned in the current era of globalization.[30]

The case for self-insurance. What if a country wants to peg, but none of the above ideas offers much comfort? What if capital controls are unattractive or porous, floating too risky, and currency boards too much of a straightjacket? What if a country knows that its domestic macroeconomic and financial architecture is still in a state of remodeling? What if the country looks back at the 1990s and worries that IMF programs will be too small, too late, too full of conditions, or not available when they are most needed? In some ways,

this describes many of the Asian countries, and other emerging markets, in the 2000s. The vast reserve buildup of recent years seen in these countries may be an exercise in saving for a rainy day to protect themselves against unpredictable shifts in global financial market conditions.

After what happened in 1997, some Asian countries may not turn to the IMF again—and with their reserve accumulation, they may not need to.

# Key Points

1. An exchange rate crisis is a large and sudden depreciation that brings to an end a fixed exchange rate regime.
2. Such crises are common. The typical fixed exchange rate lasts only a few years. History shows that crises can affect all types of countries—advanced, emerging, and developing.
3. Crises have economic costs that tend to be very large in emerging markets and developing countries. Political costs are also large.
4. To avoid a crisis, the central bank in a country with a fixed exchange rate regime must have the ability to peg the exchange rate. In practice, this means the central bank needs foreign currency reserves, which can be bought or sold in the forex market at the fixed rate.

5. In a simple model of a central bank, the money supply consists of domestic credit and foreign reserves. Money demand is exogenous and is determined by interest rates and output levels that we assume are beyond the control of the authorities when the exchange rate is pegged. In this model, reserves are simply money demand minus domestic credit.
6. If money demand rises (falls), holding domestic credit fixed, reserves rise (fall) by the same amount.
7. If domestic credit rises (falls), holding money demand fixed, reserves fall (rise) by the same amount and the money supply is unchanged. The combined result is called sterilization.

8. When the central bank gives assistance to the financial sector, it expands domestic credit. If it is a bailout, money demand is unchanged, and reserves drain. If it is a loan to satisfy depositors' demand for cash, then reserves stay constant.
9. A first-generation crisis occurs when domestic credit grows at a constant rate forever, usually due to the monetization of a chronic fiscal deficit. Eventually, reserves drain and the money supply grows at the same rate, causing inflation and depreciation. Myopic investors do not anticipate the drain, and when reserves run out, they see a sudden jump (depreciation) in the exchange rate. Investors with foresight will try to sell domestic currency before that jump happens and by doing so will cause a speculative attack and a sudden drain of reserves.

10. A second-generation attack occurs when the authorities' commitment to the peg is contingent. If the domestic economy is suffering too high a cost from pegging, the authorities will consider floating and using expansionary monetary policy to boost output by allowing the currency to depreciate, thus breaking the peg. If investors anticipate that the government will break the peg, they will demand a currency premium, making interest even higher under the peg and raising the costs of pegging still further. In this setup, at some intermediate costs, the authorities will maintain the peg as long as investors find the peg credible, but they will allow their currency to depreciate if investors find the peg not credible. This creates multiple equilibria and self-fulfilling crises.

# Problems

1. The economic costs of currency crises appear to be larger in emerging markets and developing countries, than they are in advanced countries. Discuss why this is the case, citing the interaction between the currency crisis and the financial sector. In what ways do currency crises lead to banking crises in these countries? In what ways do banking crises spark currency crises?

2. Using the central bank balance sheet diagrams, evaluate how each of the following shocks affects a country's ability to defend a fixed exchange rate.

a. The central bank buys government bonds.
b. Currency traders expect an appreciation in the home currency in the future.
c. An economic expansion leads to a change in home money demand.
d. The foreign interest rate increases.

3. Consider the central bank balance sheet for the country of Riqueza. Riqueza currently has \$ 1,800 million escudos in its money supply, \$ 1,100 million of which is backed by domestic government bonds; the rest is backed by foreign exchange reserves. Assume that Riqueza maintains a fixed exchange rate of one escudo per dollar, the foreign interest rate remains unchanged, and money demand takes the usual form, M/P = L(i)Y. Assume prices are sticky.

a. Show Riqueza's central bank balance sheet, assuming there are no private banks. What is the backing ratio?
b. Suppose that Riqueza's central bank sells \(200 million in government bonds. Show how this affects the central bank balance sheet. Does this change affect Riqueza's money supply? Explain why or why not. What is the backing ratio now?
c. Now, starting from this new position, suppose that there is an economic downturn in Riqueza, so that real income contracts by  $ 10\% $ . How will this affect money demand in Riqueza? How will forex traders respond to this change? Explain the responses in the money market and the forex market.

d. Using a new balance sheet, show how the change described in (c) affects Riqueza's central bank. What happens to domestic credit? What happens to Riqueza's foreign exchange reserves? Explain the responses in the money market and the forex market.
e. How will the change above affect the central bank's ability to defend the fixed exchange rate? What is the backing ratio now? Describe how this situation differs from one in which the central bank buys government bonds, as in part (b).

4. What is a currency board? Describe the strict rules about the composition of reserves and domestic credit that apply to this type of monetary arrangement.
5. What is a lender of last resort and what does it do? If a central bank acts as a lender of last resort under a fixed exchange rate regime, why are reserves at risk?
6. Suppose that a country's money supply is  \$ 1,200 million and its domestic credit is equal to \$ 800 million in the year 2005. The country maintains a fixed exchange rate, the central bank monetizes any government budget deficit, and prices are sticky.

a. Compute total reserves for the year 2005. Illustrate this situation on a central bank balance sheet diagram.
b. Now, suppose the government unexpectedly runs a \$ 100 million deficit in the year 2006 and the money supply is unchanged. Illustrate this change on your diagram. What is the new level of reserves?
c. If the deficit is unexpected, will the central bank be able to defend the fixed exchange rate?
d. Suppose the government runs a deficit of \(100 million each year from this point forward. What will eventually happen to the central bank's reserves?
e. In what year will the central bank be forced to abandon its exchange rate peg and why?
f. What if the future deficits are anticipated? How does your answer to part (e) change? Explain briefly.

7. Consider two countries with fixed exchange rate regimes. In one country, government authorities exert fiscal dominance. In the other, they do not. Describe how this affects the central bank's ability to defend the exchange rate peg. How might this difference in fiscal dominance affect the central bank's credibility?

8. The government of the Republic of Andea is currently pegging the Andean peso to the dollar at  $ E = 1 $ peso per dollar. Assume the following: In year 1 the money supply $ M $ is 2,250 pesos, reserves $ R $ are 1,250 pesos, and domestic credit $ B $ is 1,000 pesos. To finance spending, $ B $ is growing at $ 50\% $ per year. Inflation is currently zero, prices are flexible, PPP holds at all times, and initially, $ P = 1 $. Assume also that the foreign price level is $ P^{*} = 1 $, so PPP holds. The government will float the peso if and only if it runs out of reserves. The U.S. nominal interest rate is $ 5\% $. Real output is fixed at $ Y = 2,250 $ at all times. Real money balances are $ M / P = 2,250 = L(i)Y $, and $ L $  is initially equal to 1.

a. Assume that Andean investors are myopic and do not foresee the reserves running out. Compute domestic credit in years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. At each date, also compute reserves, money supply, and the growth rate of money supply since the previous period (in percent).

b. Continue to assume myopia. When do reserves run out? Call this time  $ T $. Assume inflation is constant after time $ T $ . What will that new inflation rate be? What will the rate of depreciation be? What will the new domestic interest rate be? (Hint: Use PPP and the Fisher effect.)

c. Continue to assume myopia. Suppose that at time  $ T $, when the home interest rate $ i $ increases, then $ L(i) $ drops from 1 to 2/3. Recall that $ Y $ remains fixed. What is $ M / P $ before time $ T $ ? What will be the new level of $ M / P $ after time $ T $ , once reserves have run out and inflation has started?

d. Continue to assume myopia. At time  $ T $ , what is the price level going to be right before reserves run out? Right after? What is the percentage increase in the price level? In the exchange rate? [Hint: Use the answer to part (c) and PPP.]

e. Suppose investors know the rate at which domestic credit is growing. Is the path described above consistent with rational behavior? What would rational investors want to do instead?

f. Given the data presented in the question so far, when do you think a speculative attack would occur? At what level of reserves will such an attack occur? Explain your answer.

9. A peg is not credible when investors fear depreciation in the future, despite official announcements. Why is the home interest rate always higher under a noncredible peg than under a credible peg? Why does that make it more costly to maintain a noncredible peg than a credible peg? Explain why nothing more than a shift in investor beliefs can cause a peg to break.

10. You are the economic advisor to Sir Bufton Tufton, the prime minister of Perfidia. The Bank of Perfidia is pegging the exchange rate of the local currency, the Perfidian albion. The albion is pegged to the wotan, which is the currency of the neighboring country of Wagneria. Until this week both countries have been at full employment. This morning, new data showed that Perfidia was in a mild recession,  $ 1\% $ below desired output. Tufton believes a downturn of $ 1\% $  or less is economically and politically acceptable but a larger downturn is not. He must face the press in 15 minutes and is considering making one of three statements:

a. "We will abandon the peg to the wotan immediately."
b. "Our policies will not change unless economic conditions deteriorate further."
c. "We shall never surrender our peg to the wotan."

What would you say to Tufton concerning the merits of each statement?

11. What steps have been proposed to prevent exchange rate crises? Discuss their pros and cons.
