# Exchange Rates I: The Monetary Approach in the Long Run

Our willingness to pay a certain price for foreign money must ultimately and essentially be due to the fact that this money possesses a purchasing power as against commodities and services in that foreign country.

Gustav Cassel, of the Swedish school of economics, 1922

The fundamental things apply / As time goes by.

Herman Hupfeld, songwriter, 1931 (featured in the film Casablanca, 1942)

The cost of living is usually rising, but it rises in some places more than others. From 1970 to 1990, for example, a standardized Canadian basket of consumer goods rose in price considerably. In 1970 a Canadian would have spent C\$100 (100 Canadian dollars) to purchase this basket; by 1990 the same basket cost C\$392. Thus, Canadian prices rose by 292\%. Over the same period, in the United States, a basket of goods that initially cost \$100 in 1970 had risen in cost to \$336 by 1990. Thus, U.S. prices rose by only 236\%. Both countries witnessed serious inflation, but Canadian prices rose more.

Did these price changes cause U.S. goods to appear relatively cheaper? Would they have caused Canadians to start spending more on U.S. goods, or Americans to spend less on Canadian goods?

The answer to these questions is no. In 1970 C\$1 was worth almost exactly \$1 (1 U.S. dollar). So in 1970 both baskets cost the same when their cost was expressed in a common currency, about C$100 = $100. By 1990, however, the Canadian dollar had depreciated relative to its 1970 value and C\$1.16 was needed to buy \$1.00. Thus, the \$336 U.S. basket in 1990 actually cost $336 × 1.16 = C$390 when expressed in Canadian currency—almost the same price as the C\$392 Canadian basket! (Conversely, expressed in U.S. currency, the Canadian basket cost about 392/1.16 = \$338, almost the same as the \$336 U.S. basket.)

6 Conclusions

In this example, although Canadian prices rose about  $16\%$  more than U.S. prices, U.S. residents also found that each of their U.S. dollars could buy about  $16\%$  more loonies. From the U.S. point of view, the cost of the baskets in each country expressed in U.S. dollars rose by about the same amount. The same was true from the Canadian perspective with all prices expressed in loonies. Economists (such as Gustav Cassel, quoted previously) would say that the relative purchasing power of each currency (in terms of U.S. versus Canadian goods) had remained the same.

Is it a coincidence that the changes in prices and exchange rates turned out that way? One of the oldest and most fundamental macroeconomic hypotheses, dating back to the sixteenth century, asserts that this outcome is not a coincidence at all—and that in the long run, prices and exchange rates will always adjust so that the purchasing power of each currency remains comparable over baskets of goods in different countries (as here, where  \$100 and$ C100 could purchase comparable amounts of goods in 1970, and also in 1990). This hypothesis, which we explore in this chapter, provides another key building block in the theory of how exchange rates are determined. In the last chapter, uncovered interest parity provided us with a theory of how the spot exchange rate is determined, given knowledge of three variables: the expected future exchange rate, the home interest rate, and the foreign interest rate. In this chapter we look at the long run to see how the expected future exchange rate is determined; then, in the next chapter, we turn to the short run and discuss how interest rates are determined in each country. When all the pieces are put together, we will have a complete theory of how exchange rates are determined in the short run and the long run.

If investors are to make forecasts of future exchange rates, they need a plausible theory of how exchange rates are determined in the long run. The theory we develop in this chapter has two parts. The first part involves the theory of purchasing power, which links the exchange rate to price levels in each country in the long run. This theory provides a partial explanation of the determinants of long-run exchange rates, but it raises another question: How are price levels determined? In the second part of the chapter, we explore how price levels are related to monetary conditions in each country. Combining the monetary theory of price level determination with the purchasing power theory of exchange rate determination, we emerge with a long-run theory known as the monetary approach to exchange rates. The goal of this chapter is to set out the long-run relationships between money, prices, and exchange rates.

# 1 Exchange Rates and Prices in the Long Run: Purchasing Power Parity and Goods Market Equilibrium

Just as arbitrage occurs in the international market for financial assets, it also occurs in the international markets for goods. An implication of complete goods market arbitrage would be that the prices of goods in different countries expressed in a common currency must be equalized. Applied to a single good, this idea is called the law of one price; applied to an entire basket of goods, it is called the theory of purchasing power parity.

Why should these "laws" hold? If the price of a good is not the same in two locations, buyers will rush to buy at the cheap location (forcing prices up there) and avoid buying from the expensive location (forcing prices down there). Some factors, such as the costs of transporting goods between locations, may hinder the process of arbitrage, and more refined models take such frictions into account. For now, our goal is to develop a simple yet useful theory based on an idealized world of frictionless trade where transaction costs can be neglected. We start at the microeconomic level with single goods and the law of one price. We then move to the macroeconomic level to consider baskets of goods and purchasing power parity.

# The Law of One Price

The law of one price (LOOP) states that in the absence of trade frictions (such as transport costs and tariffs), and under conditions of free competition and price flexibility (where no individual seller or buyer has the power to manipulate prices and prices can freely adjust), identical goods sold in different locations must sell for the same price when prices are expressed in a common currency.

To see how the law of one price operates, consider the trade in diamonds that takes place between the United States and the Netherlands. Suppose that a diamond of a given quality is priced at €5,000 in the Amsterdam market, and the exchange rate is \$1.20 per euro. If the law of one price holds, the same-quality diamond should sell in New York for (€5,000 per diamond) × (1.20 \$/€) = 6,000 per diamond.

Why will the prices be the same? Under competitive conditions and frictionless trade, arbitrage will ensure this outcome. If diamonds were more expensive in New York, arbitragers would buy at a low price in Holland and sell at a high price in Manhattan. If Dutch prices were higher, arbitragers would profit from the reverse trade. By definition, in a market equilibrium there are no arbitrage opportunities. If diamonds can be freely moved between New York and Amsterdam, both markets must offer the same price. Economists refer to this situation in the two locations as an integrated market.

We can mathematically state the law of one price as follows, for the case of any good  $g$  sold in two locations, say, Europe (EUR, meaning the Eurozone) and the United States (US). The relative price (denoted  $q_{\text{US/EUR}}^g$ ) is the ratio of the good's price in Europe relative to the good's price in the United States where both prices are expressed in a common currency.

Using subscripts to indicate locations and currencies, the relative price can be written

$$
\underline {{q _ {U S / E U R} ^ {\mathrm {g}}}} = \underbrace {(E _ {\S / \epsilon} P _ {E U R} ^ {\mathrm {g}})} / \underbrace {P _ {U S} ^ {\mathrm {g}}}
$$

Relative price of good  $g$  in Europe versus U.S.

European price of good g in $

U.S. price of good g in $ where  $P_{US}^{g}$  is the good's price in the United States,  $P_{EUR}^{g}$  is the good's price in Europe, and  $E_{\mathbb{S}/\mathbb{E}}$  is the dollar-euro exchange rate used to convert euro prices into dollar prices.

Notice that  $q_{US/EUR}^g$  expresses the rate at which goods can be exchanged: it tells us how many units of the U.S. good are needed to purchase one unit of the same good in Europe (hence, the subscript uses the notation US/EUR). This contrasts with the nominal exchange rate  $E_{\$/\epsilon}$  which expresses the rate at which currencies can be exchanged ( $/€$ ).

The law of one price may or may not hold. Recall from Chapter 13 that there are three possibilities in an arbitrage situation of this kind: the ratio exceeds 1 and the good is costlier in Europe; the ratio is less than 1 and the good is cheaper in Europe; or  $E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}P_{EUR}^g = P_{US}^g$ , the ratio is  $q_{US/EUR}^g = 1$ , and the good is the same price in both locations. Only in the final case is there no arbitrage, the condition that defines market equilibrium. In equilibrium, European and U.S. prices, expressed in the same currency, are equal; the relative price  $q$  equals 1, and the law of one price holds.

How does the law of one price further our understanding of exchange rates? We can rearrange the equation for price equality,  $E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}P_{EUR}^{g} = P_{US}^{g}$ , to show that if the law of one price holds, then the exchange rate must equal the ratio of the goods' prices expressed in the two currencies:

$$
\underbrace{E_{\S/\ell}}_{\substack{\text{Exchange}\\ \text{rate}}} = \underbrace{P_{US}^{g} / P_{EUR}^{g}}_{\substack{\text{Ratio of}\\ \text{goods' prices}}}
$$

One final word of caution: given our concerns in the previous chapter about the right way to define the exchange rate, we must take care when using expressions that are ratios to ensure that the units on each side of the equation correspond. In the last equation, we know we have it right because the left-hand side is expressed in dollars per euro and the right-hand side is also a ratio of dollars to euros ( $per unit of goods divided by$  per unit of goods).

# Purchasing Power Parity

The principle of purchasing power parity (PPP) is the macroeconomic counterpart to the microeconomic law of one price (LOOP). The law of one price relates exchange rates to the relative prices of an individual good, while purchasing power parity relates exchange rates to the relative prices of a basket of goods. In studying international macroeconomics, purchasing power parity is the more relevant concept.

We can define a price level (denoted  $P$ ) in each location as a weighted average of the prices of all goods  $g$  in a basket, using the same goods and weights in both locations. Let  $P_{US}$  be the basket's price in the United States and  $P_{EUR}$  the basket's price in Europe. If the law of one price holds for each good in the basket, it will also hold for the price of the basket as a whole. $^{1}$

To express PPP algebraically, we can compute the relative price of the two baskets of goods in each location, denoted  $q_{US/EUR}$ :

$$
\underbrace {q _ {U S / E U R}} _ {\text {R e l a t i v e p r i c e o f}} = \underbrace {(E _ {\S / \mathrm {e}} P _ {E U R})} _ {\text {E u r o p e a n}} / \underbrace {P _ {U S}} _ {\text {U . S . p r i c e o f b a s k e t}}
$$

Just as there were three possible outcomes for the law of one price, there are three possibilities for PPP: the basket is cheaper in United States; the basket is cheaper in Europe; or  $E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}P_{\mathbb{E}\mathbb{U}\mathbb{R}} = P_{\mathbb{U}\mathbb{S}}$ ; the basket is the same price in both locations, and  $q_{\mathrm{US} / \mathrm{EUR}} = 1$ . In the first two cases, the basket is cheaper in one location and profitable arbitrage on the baskets is possible. Only in the third case is there no arbitrage. PPP holds when price levels in two countries are equal when expressed in a common currency. This statement about equality of price levels is also called absolute PPP.

For example, suppose the European basket costs €100, and the exchange rate is \$1.20 per euro. For PPP to hold, the U.S. basket would have to cost 1.20 × 100 = \$120.

# The Real Exchange Rate

The relative price of the two countries' baskets (denoted  $q$ ) is the macroeconomic counterpart to the microeconomic relative price of individual goods ( $q^g$ ). The relative price of the baskets is one of the most important variables in international macroeconomics, and it has a special name: it is known as the real exchange rate. The real exchange rate  $q_{US/EUR} = E_{\mathbb{S}/\mathbb{E}}P_{EUR} / P_{US}$  tells us how many U.S. baskets are needed to purchase one European basket.

As with the nominal exchange rate, we need to be careful about what is in the numerator of the real exchange rate and what is in the denominator. According to our definition (based on the case we just examined), we will refer to  $q_{US/EUR} = E_{\mathbb{S}/\mathbb{E}}P_{EUR} / P_{US}$  as the home country, or the U.S. real exchange rate: it is the price of the European basket in terms of the U.S. basket (or, if we had a Home-Foreign example, the price of a Foreign basket in terms of a Home basket).

To avoid confusion, it is essential to understand the difference between nominal exchange rates (which we have studied so far) and real exchange rates. The exchange rate for currencies is a nominal concept; it says how many dollars can be exchanged for one euro. The real exchange rate is a real concept; it says how many U.S. baskets of goods can be exchanged for one European basket.

The real exchange rate has some terminology similar to that used with the nominal exchange rate:

If the real exchange rate rises (more Home goods are needed in exchange for Foreign goods), we say Home has experienced a real depreciation.

If the real exchange rate falls (fewer Home goods are needed in exchange for Foreign goods), we say Home has experienced a real appreciation.

# Absolute PPP and the Real Exchange Rate

We can restate absolute PPP in terms of real exchange rates: purchasing power parity states that the real exchange rate is equal to 1. Under absolute PPP, all baskets have the same price when expressed in a common currency, so their relative price is 1.

It is common practice to use the absolute PPP-implied level of 1 as a benchmark or reference level for the real exchange rate. This leads naturally to some new terminology:

If the real exchange rate  $q_{\text{US/EUR}}$  is below 1 by  $x\%$ , then Foreign goods are relatively cheap:  $x\%$  cheaper than Home goods. In this case, the Home currency (the dollar) is said to be strong, the euro is weak, and we say the euro is undervalued by  $x\%$ .

If the real exchange rate  $q_{\text{US/EUR}}$  is above 1 by  $x\%$ , then Foreign goods are relatively expensive:  $x\%$  more expensive than Home goods. In this case, the Home currency (the dollar) is said to be weak, the euro is strong, and we say the euro is overvalued by  $x\%$ .

For example, if a European basket costs  $E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}P_{\text{EUR}} = \550$  in dollar terms, and a U.S. basket costs only  $P_{\text{US}} = \$ 500 , then  $q_{\text{US/EUR}} = E_{\mathbb{S} / \mathbb{E}}P_{\text{EUR}} / P_{\text{US}} = \550 / \$ 500 = 1.10 , the euro is strong, and the euro is  $10\%$  overvalued against the dollar.

# Absolute PPP, Prices, and the Nominal Exchange Rate

Finally, just as we did with the law of one price, we can rearrange the no-arbitrage equation for the equality of price levels,  $E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}P_{EUR} = P_{US}$ , to allow us to solve for the exchange rate that would be implied by absolute PPP:

$$
\text {A b s o l u t e P P P :} \underbrace {E _ {\mathbb {S} / \epsilon}} _ {\text {E x c h a n g e r a t e}} = \underbrace {P _ {U S} / P _ {E U R}} _ {\text {R a t i o o f p r i c e l e v e l s}} \tag {14-1}
$$

This is one of the most important equations in our course of study because it shows how PPP (or absolute PPP) makes a clear prediction about exchange rates: Purchasing power parity implies that the exchange rate at which two currencies trade equals the relative price levels of the two countries.

For example, if a basket of goods costs \$460 in the United States and the same basket costs €400 in Europe, the theory of PPP predicts an exchange rate of \$460/€400 = 1.15 per euro.

Thus, if we know the price levels in different locations, we can use PPP to determine an implied exchange rate, subject to all of our earlier assumptions about frictionless trade, flexible prices, free competition, and identical goods. The PPP relationship between the price levels in two countries and the exchange rate is therefore a key building block in our theory of how exchange rates are determined, as shown in Figure 14-1. Moreover, the theory is not tied to any point in time: if we can forecast future price levels, then we can also use PPP to forecast the expected future exchange rate implied by those forecasted future price levels, which is the main goal of this chapter.

# Relative PPP, Inflation, and Exchange Rate Depreciation

PPP in its absolute PPP form involves price levels, but in macroeconomics we are often more interested in the rate at which price levels change than we are in the price levels themselves. The rate of growth of the price level is known as the rate of inflation, or simply inflation. For example, if the price level today is 100, and one year from now it is 103.5, then the rate of inflation is  $3.5\%$  (per year). Because inflation is such an important variable in macroeconomics, we examine the implications of PPP for the study of inflation.

To consider changes over time, we introduce a subscript  $t$  to denote the time period, and calculate the rate of change of both sides of Equation (14-1) from period  $t$  to

period  $t + 1$ . On the left-hand side, the rate of change of the exchange rate in Home is the rate of exchange rate depreciation in Home given by

$$
\frac {\Delta E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}}{E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}} \qquad = \qquad \underbrace {E _ {\S / \epsilon , t + 1} - E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}} _ {E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}}
$$

Rate of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate

On the right of Equation (14-1), the rate of change of the ratio of two price levels equals the rate of change of the numerator minus the rate of change of the denominator:

$$
\frac {\Delta \left(P _ {U S} / P _ {E U R}\right)}{\left(P _ {U S} / P _ {E U R}\right)} = \frac {\Delta P _ {U S , t}}{P _ {U S , t}} - \frac {\Delta P _ {E U R , t}}{P _ {E U R , t}} = \underbrace {\left(\frac {P _ {U S , t + 1} - P _ {U S , t}}{P _ {U S , t}}\right)} _ {\text {R a t e o f i n f l a t i o n i n}} - \underbrace {\left(\frac {P _ {E U R , t + 1} - P _ {E U R , t}}{P _ {E U R , t}}\right)} _ {\text {R a t e o f i n f l a t i o n i n}} = \pi_ {U S} - \pi_ {E U R}
$$ where the terms in brackets are the inflation rates in each location, denoted  $\pi_{US}$  and  $\pi_{EUR}$ , respectively.


If Equation (14-1) holds for levels of exchange rates and prices, then it must also hold for rates of change in these variables. By combining the last two expressions, we obtain

$$

\text {R e l a t i v e P P P :} \quad \underbrace {\frac {\Delta E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}}{E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}}} = \underbrace {\pi_ {U S , t} - \pi_ {E U R , t}} _ {\text {I n f l a t i o n d i f f e r e n t i a l}} \tag {14-2}

$$

Rate of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate

This way of expressing PPP is called relative PPP, and it implies that the rate of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate equals the difference between the inflation rates of two countries (the inflation differential).

We saw relative PPP in action in the example at the start of this chapter. Over 20 years, Canadian prices rose  $16\%$  more than U.S. prices, and the Canadian dollar depreciated  $16\%$  against the U.S. dollar. Converting these to annual rates, Canadian prices rose by  $0.75\%$  per year more than U.S. prices (the inflation differential), and the loonie depreciated by  $0.75\%$  per year against the dollar. Relative PPP held in this case.

Two points should be kept in mind about relative PPP. First, unlike absolute PPP, relative PPP predicts a relationship between changes in prices and changes in exchange rates, rather than a relationship between their levels. Second, remember that relative PPP is derived from absolute PPP. Hence, the latter always implies the former: if absolute PPP holds, this implies that relative PPP must hold also. But the converse need not be true: relative PPP does not necessarily imply absolute PPP (if relative PPP holds, absolute PPP can hold or fail). For example, imagine that all goods consistently cost  $20\%$  more in country A than in country B, so absolute PPP fails; however, it still can be the case that the inflation differential between A and B (say,  $5\%$ ) is always equal to the rate of depreciation (say,  $5\%$ ), so relative PPP will still hold.

# Summary

The purchasing power parity theory, whether in the absolute PPP or relative PPP form, suggests that price levels in different countries and exchange rates are tightly linked, either in their absolute levels or in the rates at which they change. To assess how useful this theory is, let's look at some empirical evidence to see how well the theory matches reality. We can then reexamine the workings of PPP and reassess its underlying assumptions.

# APPLICATION

# Evidence for PPP in the Long Run and Short Run

Is there evidence for PPP? The data offer some support for relative PPP most clearly over the long run, when even moderate inflation mounts and leads to large cumulative changes in price levels and, hence, substantial cumulative inflation differentials.

The scatterplot in Figure 14-2 shows average rates of depreciation and inflation differentials for a sample of countries compared with the United States over three decades from 1975 to 2005. If relative PPP were true, then the depreciation of each country's currency would exactly equal the inflation differential, and the data would line up on the 45-degree line. We see that this is not literally true, but the correlation

is close. Relative PPP is an approximate, useful guide to the relationship between prices and exchange rates in the long run, over horizons of many years or decades.

But the purchasing power theory turns out to be a fairly useless theory in the short run, over horizons of just a few years. This is easily seen by examining the time series of relative price ratio and exchange rates for any pair of countries, and looking at the behavior of these variables from year to year and not just over a long period. If absolute PPP held at all times, then the exchange rate would always equal the relative price ratio. Figure 14-3 shows 35 years of data for the United States and United Kingdom from 1975 to 2010. This figure confirms the relevance of absolute and relative PPP in the long run because the price-level ratio and the exchange rate have similar levels and drift together along a common trend. In the short run, however, the two series show substantial and persistent differences. In any given year the differences can be 10\%, 20\%, or more. These year-to-year differences in levels and changes show that absolute and relative PPP fail in the short run. For example, from 1980 to 1985, the pound depreciated by 45\% (from 2.32 to 1.28 per pound), but the cumulative inflation differential over these five years was only 9\%.

# How Slow Is Convergence to PPP?

If PPP were taken as a strict proposition for the short run, then price adjustment via arbitrage would occur fully and instantaneously, rapidly closing the gap between common-currency prices in different countries for all goods in the basket. This doesn't happen. The evidence suggests that PPP works better in the long run. But how long is the long run?

Research shows that price differences—the deviations from PPP—can be persistent. Estimates suggest that these deviations may die out at a rate of about  $15\%$  per year. This kind of measure is often called a speed of convergence: in this case, it implies that after one year,  $85\%$  (0.85) of an initial price difference persists; compounding, after two years,  $72\%$  of the gap persists  $(0.72 = 0.85^2)$ ; and after four years,  $52\%$

FIGURE 14-3

Exchange Rates and Relative Price Levels Data for the United States and United Kingdom for 1975 to 2010 show that the exchange rate and relative price levels do not always move together in the short run. Relative price levels tend to change slowly and have a small range of movement; exchange rates move more abruptly and experience large fluctuations. Therefore, relative PPP does not hold in the short run. However, it is a better guide to the long run, and we can see that the two series do tend to drift together over the decades.

$(0.52 = 0.85^4)$ . Thus, approximately half of any PPP deviation still remains after four years: economists would refer to this as a four-year half-life.

Such estimates provide a rule of thumb that is useful as a guide to forecasting real exchange rates. For example, suppose the home basket costs  \$100 and the foreign basket\$ 90, in home currency. Home's real exchange rate is 0.900, and the home currency is overvalued, with foreign goods less expensive than home goods. The deviation of the real exchange rate from the PPP-implied level of 1 is -10\% (or -0.1). Our rule of thumb tells us that next year 15\% of this deviation will have disappeared (i.e., 0.015), so the new deviation will be only -0.085, meaning that Home's real exchange rate would be forecast to be 0.915 after one year and thus end up a little bit closer to 1, after a small depreciation. Similarly, after four years, all else being equal, 52\% of the deviation (or 0.052) would have been erased, and the real exchange rate would by then be 0.952, only -4.8\% from PPP. (See Side Bar: Forecasting When the Real Exchange Rate Is Undervalued or Overvalued.)

# What Explains Deviations from PPP?

If it takes four years for even half of any given price difference to dissipate, as research has indicated, it is no surprise that PPP does not hold in the short run. But how can arbitrage take so long to eliminate price differences? Economists have found a variety of reasons why PPP fails in the short run.

- Transaction costs. Trade is not frictionless as we have assumed thus far because the costs of international transportation are significant for most goods and because some goods also bear additional costs, such as tariffs and duties, when they cross borders. By some recent estimates, transportation costs may add about  $20\%$  on average to the price of goods moving internationally, while tariffs (and other policy barriers) may add another  $10\%$ . Other costs arise due to the time it takes to ship goods, and the costs and time delays associated with developing distribution networks and satisfying legal and regulatory requirements in foreign markets.
- Nontraded goods. Some goods are inherently nontradable; one can think of them as having infinitely high transaction costs. Most goods and services fall somewhere between tradable and nontradable. Consider a restaurant meal; it includes traded goods, such as some raw foods, and nontraded goods, such as the work of the chef. As a result, PPP may not hold. (See Headlines: The Big Mac Index.)
- Imperfect competition and legal obstacles. Many goods are not simple undifferentiated commodities, as LOOP and PPP assume, but are differentiated products with brand names, copyrights, and legal protection. For example, consumers have the choice of cheaper generic acetaminophen or a pricier brand-name product such as Tylenol, but these are not seen as perfect substitutes. Such differentiated goods create conditions of imperfect competition because firms have some power to set the price of their good.

# Forecasting When the Real Exchange Rate Is Undervalued or Overvalued

When relative PPP holds, forecasting exchange rate changes is simple: just compute the inflation differential. But how do we forecast when PPP doesn't hold, as is often the case? Even if the real exchange rate is not equal to 1, knowing the real exchange rate and the convergence speed may still allow us to construct a forecast of real and nominal exchange rates.

To see how, let's take an example. Start with the definition of the real exchange rate:  $q_{US/EUR} = E_{\$/\epsilon} P_{EUR} / P_{US}$ . Rearranging, we find  $E_{\$/\epsilon} = q_{US/EUR} \times (P_{US} / P_{EUR})$ . By taking the rate of change of that expression, we find that the rate of change of the nominal exchange rate equals the rate of change of the real exchange rate plus home inflation minus foreign inflation:

$$

\begin{array}{c} \underbrace {\Delta E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}} _ {E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}} = \underbrace {\Delta q _ {U S / E U R , t}} _ {q _ {U S / E U R, t}} + \underbrace {\pi_ {U S , t} - \pi_ {E U R , t}} _ {\text {I n f l a t i o n d i f f e r e n t i a l}} \end{array}

$$

When the real exchange rate  $q$  is constant, the first term on the right is zero and we are back to the simple world of relative PPP and Equation (14-2). For forecasting purposes, the predicted nominal depreciation is then just the second term on the right, the inflation differential. For example, if the forecast is for U.S. inflation to be  $3\%$  next year and for European inflation to be  $1\%$ , then the inflation differential is  $+2\%$  and we would forecast a U.S. dollar depreciation, or rise in  $E_{\S/\varepsilon}$ , of  $+2\%$  next year.

What if  $q$  isn't constant and PPP fails? If there is currently a deviation from absolute PPP, but we still think that there will be convergence to absolute PPP in the long run, the first term on the right of the formula is not zero and we can estimate it given the right information.

To continue the example, suppose you are told that a U.S. basket of goods currently costs  \$100, but the European basket of the same goods costs\$ 130. You would compute a U.S. real exchange rate  $q_{\text{US/EUR}}$  of 1.30 today. But what will it be next year? If you expect absolute PPP to hold in the long run, then you expect that the U.S. real exchange rate will move toward 1. How fast? At this point, you need to know the convergence speed. Using the 15\% rule of thumb, you estimate that 15\% of the 0.3 gap between 1 and 1.3 (i.e., 0.045) will dissipate over the coming year. Hence, you forecast that the U.S. real exchange will fall from 1.3 to 1.255, implying a change of -3.46\% in the coming year. In this case, adding the two terms on the right of the expression given previously, you forecast that the approximate change in E next year will be the change in  $q_{\text{US/EUR}}$  of -3.46\% plus the inflation differential of +2\%, for a total of -1.46\%; that is, a dollar appreciation of 1.46\% against the euro.

The intuition for the result is as follows: the U.S. dollar is undervalued against the euro. If convergence to PPP is to happen, then some of that undervaluation will dissipate over the course of the year through a real appreciation of the dollar (predicted to be  $3.46\%$ ). That real appreciation can be broken down into two components:

1. U.S. goods will experience higher inflation than European goods (we have predicted that the inflation differential will be  $+2\%$ ).
2. The remainder of the real appreciation will be accomplished via a  $1.46\%$  nominal dollar appreciation (predicted based on a convergence speed of  $15\%$  per year).

countries (pharmaceutical companies, for example, charge different prices for drugs in different countries). This practice is possible because arbitrage can be shut down by legal threats or regulations. If you try to import large quantities of a firm's pharmaceutical and resell them as an unauthorized distributor, you will probably hear very quickly from the firm's lawyers and/or from the government regulators. The same would apply to many other goods such as automobiles and consumer electronics.

Price stickiness. One of the most common assumptions of macroeconomics is that prices are "sticky" in the short run—that is, they do not or cannot adjust quickly and flexibly to changes in market conditions. PPP assumes that arbitrage can force prices to adjust, but adjustment will be slowed down by price stickiness. Empirical evidence shows that many goods' prices do not adjust quickly in the short run. For example, in Figure 14-3, we saw that the nominal exchange rate moves up and down in a very dramatic fashion but that price levels are much more sluggish in their movements and do not fully match exchange rate changes.


Despite these problems, the evidence suggests that as a long-run theory of exchange rates, PPP is still a useful approach. And PPP may become even more relevant in the future as arbitrage becomes more efficient and more goods and services are traded. Years ago we might have taken it for granted that certain goods and services (such as pharmaceuticals, customer support, and health-care services) were strictly nontraded and thus not subject to arbitrage at the international level. Today, many consumers shop for pharmaceuticals overseas to save money. If you dial a U.S. software support call center, you may find yourself being assisted by an operator in another country. In some countries, citizens motivated by cost considerations may travel overseas for dental treatment, eye care, hip replacements, and other health services (so-called medical tourism or health tourism). These globalization trends may well continue.

# The Big Mac Index

For more than 25 years, The Economist newspaper has engaged in a whimsical attempt to judge PPP theory based on a well-known, globally uniform consumer good: McDonald's Big Mac. The over- or undervaluation of a currency against the U.S. dollar is gauged by comparing the relative prices of a burger in a common currency, and expressing the difference as a percentage deviation from one:

$$

\text {B i g M a c I n d e x} = q ^ {\text {B i g M a c}} - 1 = \left(\frac {E _ {\mathbb {S} / \text {l o c a l c u r r e n c y}} P _ {\text {l o c a l}} ^ {\text {B i g M a c}}}{P _ {\text {U S}} ^ {\text {B i g M a c}}}\right) - 1

$$ less than the U.S. price. So the peso was  $4 \%$ undervalued against the U.S. dollar according to this measure, and Argentina's exchange rate would have had to appreciate to 4.39 pesos per dollar to attain the level implied by a burgerbased PPP theory. An example of overvaluation appears in Row 4, in the case of neighboring Brazil. There a Big Mac cost 10.08 reais, or 4.94 in U.S. currency at the prevailing exchange

Table 14-1 shows the July 2012 survey results, and some examples will illustrate how the calculations work. Row 1 shows the average U.S. dollar price of the Big Mac of  \$4.33. An example of undervaluation appears in Row 2, where we see that the Buenos Aires correspondent found the same burger cost 19 pesos, which, at an actual exchange rate of 4.57 pesos per dollar, worked out to be\$ 4.16 in U.S. currency, or 4\%

To get to its PPP-implied level, and put the burgers at parity, Brazil's currency would have needed to depreciate to 2.33 reais per dollar. Looking through the table, burger disparity is typical, with only 7 countries coming within  $\pm 5\%$  of PPP.

# TABLE 14-1

The Big Mac Index The table shows the price of a Big Mac in July 2012 in local currency (column 1) and converted to U.S. dollars (column 2) using the actual exchange rate (column 4). The dollar price can then be compared with the average price of a Big Mac in the United States (4.33 in column 1, row 1). The difference (column 5) is a measure of the overvaluation (+) or undervaluation (-) of the local currency against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate against the dollar implied by PPP (column 3) is the hypothetical price of dollars in local currency that would have equalized burger prices, which may be compared with the actual observed exchange rate (column 4).

# 2 Money, Prices, and Exchange Rates in the Long Run: Money Market Equilibrium in a Simple Model

It is time to take stock of the theory developed so far in this chapter. Up to now, we have concentrated on PPP, which says that in the long run the exchange rate is determined by the ratio of the price levels in two countries. But this prompts a question: What determines those price levels?

Monetary theory supplies an answer: according to this theory, in the long run, price levels are determined in each country by the relative demand and supply of money. You may recall this theory from previous macroeconomics courses in the context of a closed economy. This section recaps the essential elements of monetary theory and shows how they fit into our theory of exchange rates in the long run.

# What Is Money?

We recall the distinguishing features of this peculiar asset that is so central to our everyday economic life. Economists think of money as performing three key functions in an economy:

1. Money is a store of value because, as with any asset, money held from today until tomorrow can still be used to buy goods and services in the future. Money's rate of return is low compared with many other assets. Because we earn no interest on it, there is an opportunity cost to holding money. If this cost is low, we hold money more willingly than other assets (stocks, bonds, and so forth).
2. Money is a unit of account in which all prices in the economy are quoted. When we enter a store in France, we expect to see the prices of goods to read something like "100 euros"—not "10,000 Japanese yen" or "500 bananas," even though, in principle, the yen or the banana could also function as a unit of account in France (bananas would, however, be a poor store of value).
3. Money is a medium of exchange that allows us to buy and sell goods and services without the need to engage in inefficient barter (direct swaps of goods). The ease with which we can convert money into goods and services is a measure of how liquid money is compared with the many illiquid assets in our portfolios (such as real estate). Money is the most liquid asset of all.

# The Measurement of Money

What counts as money? Clearly, currency (coins and bills) in circulation is money. But do checking accounts count as money? What about savings accounts, mutual funds, and other securities? Figure 14-4 depicts the most widely used measures of the money supply and illustrates their relative magnitudes with recent data from the United States. The most basic concept of money is currency in circulation (i.e., in the hands of the nonbank public). After that, M0 is typically the narrowest definition of money (also called "base money"), and it includes both currency in circulation and the reserves of commercial banks (liquid cash held in their vaults or on deposit at the Fed). Normally, in recent years, banks' reserves have been very small and so M0 has been virtually identical to currency in circulation. This changed dramatically after the financial crisis of 2008 gave rise to liquidity problems, and banks began to maintain

# The Measurement of

Money This figure shows the major kinds of monetary aggregates (currency, M0, M1, and M2) for the United States from 2004 to 2010. Normally, bank reserves are very close to zero, so M0 and currency are virtually identical, but reserves spiked up during the financial crisis in 2008, as private banks sold securities to the Fed and stored up the cash proceeds in their Fed reserve accounts as a precautionary hoard of liquidity.

Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).

huge reserves at the Fed as a precaution. (When and how this unprecedented board of cash will be unwound remains to be seen, and this is a matter of some concern to economists and policy makers.)

A different narrow measure of money, M1, includes currency in circulation plus highly liquid instruments such as demand deposits in checking accounts and traveler's checks, but it excludes bank's reserves, and thus may be a better gauge of money available for transactions purposes. A much broader measure of money, M2, includes slightly less liquid assets such as savings and small time deposits.[7]

For our purposes, money is defined as the stock of liquid assets that are routinely used to finance transactions, as implied by the "medium of exchange" function of money. So, in this book, when we speak of money (denoted  $M$ ), we will generally mean M1 (currency in circulation plus demand deposits). Many important assets are excluded from M1, including longer-term assets held by individuals and the voluminous interbank deposits used in the foreign exchange market discussed in the previous chapter. These assets do not count as money in the sense we use the word because they are relatively illiquid and not used routinely for transactions.

# The Supply of Money

How is the supply of money determined? In practice, a country's central bank controls the money supply. Strictly speaking, by issuing notes and coins (and private bank reserves), the central bank controls directly only the level of M0, or base money, the amount of currency and reserves in the economy. However, it can indirectly control the level of M1 by using monetary policy to influence the behavior of the private banks that are responsible for checking deposits. The intricate mechanisms by which monetary policy affects M1 are beyond the scope of this book. For our purposes, we make the simplifying assumption that the central bank's policy tools are sufficient to allow it to control the level of M1 indirectly, but accurately.[8]

# The Demand for Money: A Simple Model

A simple theory of household money demand is motivated by the assumption that the need to conduct transactions is in proportion to an individual's income. For example, if an individual's income doubles from  $20,000 to$ 40,000, we expect his or her demand for money (expressed in dollars) to double also.

Moving from the individual or household level up to the aggregate or macroeconomic level, we can infer that the aggregate money demand will behave similarly. All else equal, a rise in national dollar income (nominal income) will cause a proportional increase in transactions and, hence, in aggregate money demand.

This insight suggests a simple model in which the demand for money is proportional to dollar income. This model is known as the quantity theory of money:

$$
\underbrace {M ^ {d}} _ {\substack {\text {Demand} \\ \text {for money (\$)}}} = \underbrace {\overline {L}} _ {\substack {\text {A constant} \\ \text {Nominal}}} \times \underbrace {P Y} _ {\substack {\text {income (\$)}}}
$$

Here,  $PY$  measures the total nominal dollar value of income in the economy, equal to the price level  $P$  times real income  $Y$ . The term  $\overline{L}$  is a constant that measures how much demand for liquidity is generated for each dollar of nominal income. To emphasize this point, we assume for now that every  \$1 of nominal income requires$ \overline{L}$ of money for transactions purposes and that this relationship is constant. (Later, we relax this assumption.)

The intuition behind the last equation is as follows: If the price level rises by  $10\%$  and real income is fixed, we are paying a  $10\%$  higher price for all goods, so the dollar cost of transactions rises by  $10\%$ . Similarly, if real income rises by  $10\%$  but prices stay fixed, the dollar amount of transactions will rise by  $10\%$ . Hence, the demand for nominal money balances,  $M^d$ , is proportional to the nominal income  $PY$ .

Another way to look at the quantity theory is to convert all quantities into real quantities by dividing the previous equation by  $P$ , the price level (the price of a basket of goods). Quantities are then converted from nominal dollars to real units (specifically, into units of baskets of goods). These conversions allow us to derive the demand for real money balances:

$$
\underbrace{\frac{M^{d}}{P}}_{\substack{\text{Demand for}\\ \text{real money}}} = \underbrace{\overline{L}}_{\substack{\text{A constant}}} \times \underbrace{Y}_{\substack{\text{Real income}}}
$$

Real money balances measure the purchasing power of the stock of money in terms of goods and services. The expression just given says that the demand for real money balances is proportional to real income. The more real income we have, the more real transactions we have to perform, and the more real money we need.

# Equilibrium in the Money Market

The condition for equilibrium in the money market is that the demand for money  $M^d$  must equal the supply of money  $M$ , which we assume to be under the control of the central bank. Imposing this condition on the last two equations, we find that nominal money supply equals nominal money demand:

$$
M = \bar {L} P Y
$$ and, equivalently, that real money supply equals real money demand:


$$

\frac {M}{P} = \bar {L} Y

$$

# A Simple Monetary Model of Prices

We are now in a position to put together a simple model of the exchange rate, using two building blocks. The first building block, the quantity theory, is a model that links prices to monetary conditions. The second building block, PPP, is a model that links exchange rates to prices.

We consider two locations, or countries, as before; the United States will be the home country and we will treat the Eurozone as the foreign country. We shall refer to the Eurozone, or more simply Europe, as a country in this and later examples. The model generalizes to any pair of countries or locations.

Let's consider the last equation given and apply it to the United States, adding U.S. subscripts for clarity. We can rearrange this formula to obtain an expression for the U.S. price level:

$$

P _ {U S} = \frac {M _ {U S}}{\overline {{L}} _ {U S} Y _ {U S}}

$$

Note that the price level is determined by how much nominal money is issued relative to the demand for real money balances: the numerator on the right-hand side  $M_{US}$  is the total supply of nominal money; the denominator  $\overline{L}_{US}Y_{US}$  is the total demand for real money balances.

The analogous expression for the European price level is:

$$

P _ {E U R} = \frac {M _ {E U R}}{\bar {L} _ {E U R} Y _ {E U R}}

$$

The last two equations are examples of the fundamental equation of the monetary model of the price level. Two such equations, one for each country, give us another important building block for our theory of prices and exchange rates as shown in Figure 14-5.

In the long run, we assume prices are flexible and will adjust to put the money market in equilibrium. For example, if the amount of money in circulation (the nominal money supply) rises, say, by a factor of 100, and real income stays the same, then there will be "more money chasing the same quantity of goods." This leads to inflation, and

FIGURE 14-5

Building Block: The Monetary Theory of the Price Level According to the Long-Run Monetary Model In these models, the money supply and real income are treated as known exogenous variables (in the green boxes). The models use these variables to predict the unknown endogenous variables (in the red boxes), which are the price levels in each country.

in the long run, the price level will rise by a factor of 100. In other words, we will be in the same economy as before except that all prices will have two zeros tacked on to them.

# A Simple Monetary Model of the Exchange Rate

A long-run model of the exchange rate is close at hand. If we take the last two equations, which use the monetary model to find the price level in each country, and plug them into Equation (14-1), we can use absolute PPP to solve for the exchange rate:

$$

\underbrace {E _ {\S / \epsilon}} _ {\text {E x c h a n g e r a t e}} = \underbrace {\frac {P _ {U S}}{P _ {E U R}}} _ {\text {R a t i o o f p r i c e l e v e l s}} = \underbrace {\frac {\left(\frac {M _ {U S}}{\bar {L} _ {U S} Y _ {U S}}\right)}{\left(\frac {M _ {E U R}}{\bar {L} _ {E U R} Y _ {E U R}}\right)}} _ {\text {R e l a t i v e m o n i n a l m o n e y}}} = \underbrace {\frac {(M _ {U S} / M _ {E U R})}{(\bar {L} _ {U S} Y _ {U S} / \bar {L} _ {E U R} Y _ {E U R})}} _ {\text {R e l a w m o n e y d e m a n d s}} \tag {14-3}

$$

This is the fundamental equation of the monetary approach to exchange rates. By substituting the price levels from the monetary model into PPP, we have put together the two building blocks from Figures 14-1 and 14-5. The implications of this equation are as follows:

Suppose the U.S. money supply increases, all else equal. The right-hand side increases (the U.S. nominal money supply increases relative to Europe), causing the exchange rate to increase (the U.S. dollar depreciates against the euro). For example, if the U.S. money supply doubles, then all else equal, the U.S. price level doubles. That is, a bigger U.S. supply of money leads to a weaker dollar. That makes sense—there are more dollars around, so you expect each dollar to be worth less.
Now suppose the U.S. real income level increases, all else equal. Then the right-hand side decreases (the U.S. real money demand increases relative to Europe), causing the exchange rate to decrease (the U.S. dollar appreciates against the euro). For example, if the U.S. real income doubles, then all else equal, the U.S. price level falls by a factor of one-half. That is, a stronger U.S. economy leads to a stronger dollar. That makes sense—there is more demand for the same quantity of dollars, so you expect each dollar to be worth more.


# Money Growth, Inflation, and Depreciation

The model just presented uses absolute PPP to link the level of the exchange rate to the level of prices and uses the quantity theory to link prices to monetary conditions in each country. But as we have said before, macroeconomists are often more interested in rates of change of variables (e.g., inflation) rather than levels.

Can we extend our theory to this purpose? Yes, but this task takes a little work. We convert Equation (14-3) into growth rates by taking the rate of change of each term.

The first term of Equation (14-3) is the exchange rate  $E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}$ . Its rate of change is the rate of depreciation  $\Delta E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon} / E_{\mathbb{S} / \epsilon}$ . When this term is positive, say,  $1\%$ , the dollar is depreciating at  $1\%$  per year; if negative, say,  $-2\%$ , the dollar is appreciating at  $2\%$  per year.

The second term of Equation (14-3) is the ratio of the price levels  $P_{US} / P_{EUR}$ , and as we saw when we derived relative PPP at Equation (14-2), its rate of change is the rate of change of the numerator (U.S. inflation) minus the rate of change of the denominator (European inflation), which equals the inflation differential  $\pi_{US,t} - \pi_{EUR,t}$ .

What is the rate of change of the third term in Equation (14-3)? The numerator represents the U.S. price level,  $P_{US} = M_{US} / \overline{L}_{US}Y_{US}$ . Again, the growth rate of a fraction equals the growth rate of the numerator minus the growth rate of the denominator. In this case, the numerator is the money supply  $M_{US}$ , and its growth rate is  $\mu_{US}$ :

$$

\mu_ {U S, t} = \underbrace {\frac {M _ {U S , t + 1} - M _ {U S , t}}{M _ {U S , t}}}

$$

Rate of money supply growth in U.S.

The denominator is  $\overline{L}_{US}Y_{US}$ , which is a constant  $\overline{L}_{US}$  times real income  $Y_{US}$ . Thus,  $\overline{L}_{US}Y_{US}$  grows at a rate equal to the growth rate of real income  $g_{US}$ :

$$ g _ {U S, t} = \underbrace {\frac {Y _ {U S , t + 1} - Y _ {U S , t}}{Y _ {U S , t}}}
$$

Rate of real income growth in U.S.

Putting all the pieces together, the growth rate of  $P_{US} = M_{US} / \bar{L}_{US}Y_{US}$  equals the money supply growth rate  $\mu_{US}$  minus the real income growth rate  $g_{US}$ . We have already seen that the growth rate of  $P_{US}$  on the left-hand side is the inflation rate  $\pi_{US}$ . Thus, we know that

$$
\pi_ {U S, t} = \mu_ {U S, t} - g _ {U S, t} \tag {14-4}
$$

The denominator of the third term of Equation (14-3) represents the European price level,  $P_{EUR} = M_{EUR} / \overline{L}_{EUR}Y_{EUR}$ , and its rate of change is calculated similarly:

$$
\pi_ {E U R, t} = \mu_ {E U R, t} - g _ {E U R, t} \tag {14-5}
$$

The intuition for these last two expressions echoes what we said previously: when money growth is higher than real income growth, we have "more money chasing fewer goods" and this leads to inflation.

Combining Equation (14-4) and Equation (14-5), we can now solve for the inflation differential in terms of monetary fundamentals and finish our task of computing the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate:

$$
\underbrace {\frac {\Delta E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}}{E _ {\S / \epsilon , t}}} = \underbrace {\pi_ {U S , t} - \pi_ {E U R , t}} _ {\text {I n f l a t i o n d i f f e r e n t i a l}} = \left(\mu_ {U S, t} - g _ {U S, t}\right) - \left(\mu_ {E U R, t} - g _ {E U R, t}\right) \tag {14-6}
$$

Rate of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate

$$
= \underbrace {\left(\mu_ {U S , t} - \mu_ {E U R , t}\right)} _ {\text {D i f f e r e n t i a l}} - \underbrace {\left(g _ {U S , t} - g _ {E U R , t}\right)} _ {\text {D i f f e r e n t i a l i n}}
$$

The last term here is the rate of change of the fourth term in Equation (14-3).

Equation (14-6) is the fundamental equation of the monetary approach to exchange rates expressed in rates of change, and much of the same intuition we applied in explaining Equation (14-3) carries over here.

If the United States runs a looser monetary policy in the long run measured by a faster money growth rate, the dollar will depreciate more rapidly, all else equal. For example, suppose Europe has a  $5\%$  annual rate of change of money and a  $2\%$  rate of change of real income; then its inflation would be the difference:  $5\%$  minus  $2\%$  equals  $3\%$ . Now suppose the United States has a  $6\%$  rate of change of money and a  $2\%$  rate of change of real income; then its inflation would be the difference:  $6\%$  minus  $2\%$  equals  $4\%$ . And the rate of depreciation of the dollar would be U.S. inflation minus European inflation,  $4\%$  minus  $3\%$ , or  $1\%$  per year.

If the U.S. economy grows faster in the long run, the dollar will appreciate more rapidly, all else equal. In the last numerical example, suppose the U.S. growth rate of real income in the long run increases from  $2\%$  to  $5\%$ , all else equal. U.S. inflation equals the money growth rate of  $6\%$  minus the new real income growth rate of  $5\%$ , so inflation is just  $1\%$  per year. Now the rate of dollar depreciation is U.S. inflation minus European inflation, that is,  $1\%$  minus  $3\%$ , or  $-2\%$  per year (meaning the U.S. dollar would now appreciate at  $2\%$  per year).

With a change of notation to make the United States the foreign country, the same lessons could be derived for Europe and the euro.

# 3 The Monetary Approach: Implications and Evidence

The monetary approach is the workhorse model in the study of long-run exchange rate movements. In this section, we look at some applications and empirical evidence.

# Exchange Rate Forecasts Using the Simple Model

An important application of the monetary approach to exchange rate determination is to provide a forecast of the future exchange rate. Remember from the previous chapter that foreign exchange (forex) market arbitrageers need such a forecast to be able to make arbitrage calculations using uncovered interest parity. Using Equation (14-3), we can see that a forecast of future exchange rates (the left-hand side) can be constructed as long as we know how to forecast future money supplies and real income (the right-hand side).

In practice, this is why expectations about money and real income in the future attract so much attention in the financial media, and especially in the forex market. The discussion returns with obsessive regularity to two questions. The first question — What are central banks going to do? — leads to all manner of attempts to decode the statements of central bank officials. The second question — How is the economy expected to grow in real terms? — leads to a keen interest in any economic indicators, such as productivity or investment, that might hint at changes in the rate of income growth.

Any such forecasts come with at least two major caveats. First, there is great uncertainty in trying to answer these questions, and forecasts of economic variables years in the future are inevitably subject to large errors. Nonetheless, this is one of the key tasks of financial markets. Second, whenever one uses the monetary model for forecasting, one is answering a hypothetical question: What path would exchange rates follow from now on if prices were flexible and PPP held? As forecasters know, in the short run there might be deviations from this prediction about exchange rate changes, but in the longer run, we expect the prediction will supply a more reasonable guide.

Forecasting Exchange Rates: An Example To see how forecasting might work, let's look at a simple scenario and focus on what would happen under flexible prices. Assume that U.S. and European real income growth rates are identical and equal to zero (0\%) so that real income levels are constant. Assume also that the European money supply is constant. If the money supply and real income in Europe are constant, then the European price level is constant, and European inflation is zero, as we can see from Equation (14-5). These assumptions allow us to perform a controlled thought-experiment, and focus on changes on the U.S. side of the model, all else equal. Let's look at two cases.

Case 1: A one-time unanticipated increase in the money supply. In the first, and simpler, case, suppose at some time  $T$  that the U.S. money supply rises by a fixed proportion, say,  $10\%$ , all else equal. Assuming that prices are flexible, what does our model predict will happen to the level of the exchange rate after time  $T$ ? To spell out the argument in detail, we look at the implications of our model for some key variables.

a. There is a  $10\%$  increase in the money supply  $M$ .

b. Real money balances  $M / P$  remain constant, because real income is constant.

c. These last two statements imply that price level  $P$  and money supply  $M$  must move in the same proportion, so there is a  $10\%$  increase in the price level  $P$ .

d. PPP implies that the exchange rate  $E$  and price level  $P$  must move in the same proportion, so there is a  $10\%$  increase in the exchange rate  $E$ ; that is, the dollar depreciates by  $10\%$ .

A quicker solution uses the fundamental equation of the monetary approach at Equation (14-3): the price level and exchange rate are proportional to the money supply, all else equal.

Case 2: An unanticipated increase in the rate of money growth. The model also applies to more complex scenarios. Consider a second case in which the U.S. money supply is not constant, but grows at a steady fixed rate  $\mu$ . Then suppose we learn at time  $T$  that the United States will raise the rate of money supply growth from some previously fixed rate  $\mu$  to a slightly higher rate  $\mu + \Delta \mu$ . How would people expect the exchange rate to behave, assuming price flexibility? Let's work through this case step by step:

a. Money supply  $M$  is growing at a constant rate.

b. Real money balances  $M / P$  remain constant, as before.

c. These last two statements imply that price level  $P$  and money supply  $M$  must move in the same proportion, so  $P$  is always a constant multiple of  $M$ .

d. PPP implies that the exchange rate  $E$  and price level  $P$  must move in the same proportion, so  $E$  is always a constant multiple of  $P$  (and hence of  $M$ ).

Corresponding to these four steps, the four panels of Figure 14-6 illustrate the path of the key variables in this example. This figure shows that if we can forecast

(d) Home Exchange Rate,  $E$

An Increase in the Growth Rate of the Money Supply in the Simple Model Before time  $T$ , money, prices, and the exchange rate all grow at rate  $\mu$ . Foreign prices are constant. In panel (a), we suppose at time  $T$  there is an increase  $\Delta \mu$  in the rate of growth of home money supply  $M$ . In panel (b), the quantity theory assumes that the level of real money balances remains unchanged. After time  $T$ , if real money balances  $(M / P)$  are constant, then money  $M$  and prices  $P$  still grow at the same rate, which is now  $\mu + \Delta \mu$ , so the rate of inflation rises by  $\Delta \mu$ , as shown in panel (c). PPP and an assumed stable foreign price level imply that the exchange rate will follow a path similar to that of the domestic price level, so  $E$  also grows at the new rate  $\mu + \Delta \mu$ , and the rate of depreciation rises by  $\Delta \mu$ , as shown in panel (d).

the money supply at any future period as in (a), and if we know real money balances remain constant as in (b), then we can forecast prices as in (c) and exchange rates as in (d). These forecasts are good in any future period, under the assumptions of the monetary approach. Again, Equation (14-3) supplies the answer more quickly; under the assumptions we have made, money, prices, and exchange rates all move in proportion to one another.

# Evidence for the Monetary Approach

The monetary approach to prices and exchange rates suggests that, all else equal, increases in the rate of money supply growth should be the same size as increases in the rate of inflation and the rate of exchange rate depreciation. Looking for evidence of this relationship in real-world data is one way to put this theory to the test.

The scatterplots in Figure 14-7 and Figure 14-8 show data from 1975 to 2005 for a large sample of countries. The results offer fairly strong support for the monetary theory. All else equal, Equation (14-6) predicts that an  $x\%$  difference in money growth rates (relative to the United States) should be associated with an  $x\%$  difference in inflation rates (relative to the United States) and an  $x\%$  depreciation of the home exchange rate (against the U.S. dollar). If this association were literally true in the data, then each country in the scatterplot would be on the 45-degree line. This is not exactly true, but the actual relationship is very close and offers some support for the monetary approach.

One reason the data do not sit on the 45-degree line is that all else is not equal in this sample of countries. In Equation (14-6), countries differ not only in their relative

money supply growth rates but also in their real income growth rates. Another explanation is that we have been assuming that the money demand parameter  $L$  is constant, and this may not be true in reality. This is an issue we must now confront.

# APPLICATION

# Hyperinflations

The monetary approach assumes long-run PPP, which has some support, as we saw in Figure 14-2. But we have been careful to note, again, that PPP generally works poorly in the short run. However, there is one notable exception to this general failure of PPP in the short run: hyperinflations.

Economists traditionally define a hyperinflation as occurring when the inflation rate rises to a sustained rate of more than  $50\%$  per month (which means that prices are doubling every 51 days). In common usage, some lower-inflation episodes are also called hyperinflations; for example, an inflation rate of  $1,000\%$  per year is a common rule of thumb (when inflation is "only"  $22\%$  per month).

There have been many hyperinflations worldwide since the early twentieth century. They usually occur when governments face a budget crisis, are unable to borrow to finance a deficit, and instead choose to print money to cover their financing needs. The situation is not sustainable and usually leads to economic, social, or political crisis, which is eventually resolved with a return to price stability. (For more discussion of hyperinflations and their consequences, see Side Bar: Currency Reform and Headlines: The First Hyperinflation of the Twenty-First Century.)

# SIDE BAR

# Currency Reform

Hyperinflations help us understand how some currencies become extinct if they cease to function well and lose value rapidly. Dollarization in Ecuador is a recent example. Other currencies survive such traumas, only to be reborn. But the low denomination bills—the ones, fives, tens—usually become essentially worthless and normal transactions can require you to be a millionaire. The elimination of a few pesky zeros might then be a good idea. A government may then redeminate a new unit of currency equal to  $10^{N}$  (10 raised to the power  $N$ ) old units.

Sometimes  $N$  can get quite large. In the 1980s, Argentina suffered hyperinflation. On June 1, 1983, the peso argentino replaced the (old) peso at a rate of 10,000 to 1. Then on June 14, 1985, the austral replaced the peso argentino at 1,000 to 1. Finally, on January 1, 1992, the convertible peso replaced the austral at a rate of 10,000 to 1 (i.e., 10,000,000,000 old pesos). After all this, if you had owned 1 new peso in 1983 (and had changed it into the later monies), it would have lost  $99.99997\%$  of its U.S. dollar value by 2003.

In 1946 the Hungarian pengö became so worthless that the authorities no longer printed the denomination on each note in numbers, but only in words—perhaps to avert distrust (unsuccessful), to hide embarrassment (also unsuccessful), or simply because there wasn't room to print all those zeros. By July 15, 1946, there were 76,041,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pengö in circulation. A stable new currency, the forint, was finally introduced on July 26, 1946, with each forint worth 400,000 quadrillion pengö ( $4 \times 10^{20} = 400,000,000,000,000,000,000$  pengö). The dilution of the Zimbabwean dollar from 2005 to 2009 was even more extreme, as the authorities lopped off 25 zeros in a series of reforms before the currency finally vanished from use.

PPP in Hyperinflations Each of these crises provides a unique laboratory for testing the predictions of the PPP theory. The scatterplot in Figure 14-9 looks at the data using changes in levels (from start to finish, expressed as multiples). The change in the exchange rate (with the United States) is on the vertical axis and the change in the price level (compared with the United States) is on the horizontal axis. Because of the huge changes involved, both axes use log scales in powers of 10. For example,  $10^{12}$  on the vertical axis means the exchange rate rose (the currency depreciated) by a factor of a trillion against the U.S. dollar during the hyperinflation.

If PPP holds, changes in prices and exchange rates should be equal and all observations would be on the 45-degree line. The changes follow this pattern very closely, providing support for PPP. What the hyperinflations have in common is that a very large depreciation was about equal to a very large inflation differential. In an economy with fairly stable prices and exchange rates, large changes in exchange rates and prices only develop over the very long run of years and decades; in a hyperinflation, large inflations and large depreciations are compressed into the short run of years or months, so this is one case where PPP holds quite well even in the short run.

Some price changes were outrageously large. Austria's hyperinflation of 1921 to 1922 was the first one on record, and prices rose by a factor of about 100 ( $10^{2}$ ). In Germany from 1922 to 1923, prices rose by a factor of about 20 billion ( $2 \times 10^{10}$ ); in the worst month, prices were doubling on average every two days. In Hungary from 1945 to 1946, pengö prices rose by a factor of about 4 septillion ( $4 \times 10^{27}$ ), the current record, and in July 1946, prices were doubling on average every 15 hours. Serbia's inflation from 1992 to 1994 came close to breaking the record for cumulative price changes, as did the most recent case in Zimbabwe. In comparison, Argentina's 700-fold inflation and Brazil's 200-fold inflation from 1989 to 1990 look modest.

Hanke and Alex K. F. Kwok, 2009, "On the Measurement of Zimbabwe's Hyperinflation," Cato Journal 29(2), 353-64.

Money Demand in Hyperinflations There is one other important lesson to be learned from hyperinflations. In our simple monetary model, the money demand parameter  $L$  was assumed to be constant and equal to  $\overline{L}$ . This implied that real money balances were proportional to real income, with  $M / P = \overline{L} Y$  as shown in Equation (14-5). Is this assumption of stable real money balances justified?

The evidence shown in Figure 14-10 suggests this assumption is not justified, based on a subset of the hyperinflations. For each point, on the horizontal axis of this figure, we see the peak monthly inflation rate (the moment when prices were rising most rapidly); on the vertical axis, we see the level of real money balances in that month relative to their initial level (in the month just before the hyperinflation began). If real money balances were stable, there should be no variation in the vertical dimension aside from fluctuations in real income. But there is, and with a clear pattern: the higher the level of inflation, the lower the level of real money balances. These declines are far too severe to be explained by just the fall in real incomes experienced during hyperinflations, though such income declines did occur.

This finding may not strike you as very surprising. If prices are doubling every few days (or every few hours), the money in people's pockets is rapidly turning into

The Collapse of Real Money Balances During Hyperinflations This figure shows that real money balances tend to collapse in hyperinflations as people economize by reducing their holdings of rapidly depreciating notes. The horizontal axis shows the peak monthly inflation rate  $(\%)$ , and the vertical axis shows the ratio of real money balances in that peak month relative to real money balances at the start of the hyperinflationary period. The data are shown using logarithmic scales for clarity.

worthless pieces of paper. They will try to minimize their money holdings—and will do so even more as inflation rises higher and higher, just as the figure shows. It becomes just too costly to hold very much money, despite one's need to use it for transactions.

If you thought along these lines, you have an accurate sense of how people behave during hyperinflations. You also anticipated the extensions to the simple model that we make in the next section so it is more realistic. Even during "normal" inflations—situations that are less pathological than a hyperinflation—it is implausible to assume that real money balances are perfectly stable. In our extension of the simple model, we will assume that people make the trade-off highlighted previously: comparing the benefits of holding money for transactions purposes with the costs of holding money as compared with other assets.

# 4 Money, Interest Rates, and Prices in the Long Run:

# A General Model

So far we have a long-run theory that links exchange rates to the price levels in each country: PPP. We also have a simple long-run monetary model that links price levels in each country to money supply and demand: the quantity theory.

These building blocks provide some basic intuition for the links between price levels, money, and exchange rates. The trouble is that the quantity theory's assumption — that the demand for money is stable — is implausible. In this section, we explore a more general model that addresses this shortcoming by allowing money demand to vary with

# The First Hyperinflation of the Twenty-First Century

By 2007 Zimbabwe was almost at an economic standstill, except for the printing presses churning out banknotes. A creeping inflation— $58\%$  in 1999,  $132\%$  in 2001,  $385\%$  in 2003, and  $586\%$  in 2005—was about to become hyperinflation, and the long-suffering people faced an accelerating descent into even greater chaos. Three years later, shortly after this news report, the local currency disappeared from use, replaced by U.S. dollars and South African rand.

…Zimbabwe is in the grip of one of the great hyperinflations in world history. The people of this once proud capital have been plunged into a Darwinian struggle to get by. Many have been reduced to peddlers and paupers, hawkers and black-market hustlers, eating just a meal or two a day, their hollowed cheeks a testament to their hunger.

Like countless Zimbabweans, Mrs. Moyo has calculated the price of goods by the number of days she had to spend in line at the bank to withdraw cash to buy them: a day for a bar of soap; another for a bag of salt; and four for a sack of cornmeal.

The withdrawal limit rose on Monday, but with inflation surpassing what independent economists say is an almost unimaginable 40 million percent, she said the value of the new amount would quickly be a pittance, too.

"It's survival of the fittest," said Mrs. Moyo, 29, a hair braider who sells the greens she grows in her yard for a dime a bunch. "If you're not fit, you will starve."

Economists here and abroad say Zimbabwe's economic collapse is gaining velocity, radiating instability into the heart of southern Africa. As the bankrupt government prints ever more money, inflation has gone wild, rising from 1,000 percent in 2006 to 12,000 percent in 2007…. In fact, Zimbabwe's hyperinflation is probably among the five worst of all time, said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Columbia University economics professor, along with Germany in the 1920s, Greece and Hungary in the 1940s and Yugoslavia in 1993….

Basic public services, already devastated by an exodus of professionals in recent years, are breaking down on an ever larger scale as tens of thousands of teachers, nurses, garbage collectors and janitors have simply stopped reporting to their jobs because their salaries, more worthless literally by the hour, no longer cover the cost of taking the bus to work…

The bodies of paupers in advanced states of decay were stacking up in the mortuary at Beitbridge District Hospital because not even government authorities were seeing to their burial… . Harare Central Hospital slashed admissions by almost half because so much of its cleaning staff could no longer afford to get to work.

Most of the capital, though lovely beneath its springtime canopy of lavender jacaranda blooms, was without water because the authorities had stopped paying the bills to transport the treatment chemicals. Garbage is piling up uncollected. Sixteen people have died in an outbreak of cholera in nearby Chitungwiza, spread by contaminated water and sewage…

Vigilantes in Kwekwe killed a man suspected of stealing two chickens, eggs and a bucket of corn… . And traditional chiefs complained about corrupt politicians and army officers who sold grain needed for the hungry to the politically connected instead.

the nominal interest rate. But this theory, in turn, brings another variable into play: How is the nominal interest rate determined in the long run? Answering this question will lead us to consider the links between inflation and the nominal interest rate in an open economy. With these new models in hand, we then return to the question of how best to understand what determines exchange rates in the long run.

# The Demand for Money: The General Model

The general model of money demand is motivated by two insights, the first of which carries over from the quantity theory, the simple model we studied earlier in this chapter.

There is a benefit from holding money. As is true in the simple quantity theory, the benefit of money is that individuals can conduct transactions with it, and we continue to assume that transactions demand is in proportion to income, all else equal.

- There is a cost to holding money. The nominal interest rate on money is zero,  $i_{\text{money}} = 0$ . By holding money and not earning interest, people incur the opportunity cost of holding money. For example, an individual could hold an interest-earning asset paying  $i_{\S}$ . The difference in nominal returns between this asset and money would be  $i_{\S} - i_{\text{money}} = i_{\S} > 0$ . This is one way of expressing the opportunity cost.

Moving from the individual or household level up to the macroeconomic level, we can infer that aggregate money demand in the economy as a whole will behave similarly:

All else equal, a rise in national dollar income (nominal income) will cause a proportional increase in transactions and, hence, in aggregate money demand.

All else equal, a rise in the nominal interest rate will cause the aggregate demand for money to fall.

Thus, we arrive at a general model in which money demand is proportional to nominal income, and is a decreasing function of the nominal interest rate:

$$
\underbrace {M ^ {d}} _ {\substack {\text {Demand for} \\ \text {money (\$)}}} = \underbrace {L (i)} _ {\substack {\text {A decreasing} \\ \text {function}}} \times \underbrace {P \times Y} _ {\substack {\text {Nominal} \\ \text {income (\$)}}}
$$

Recall that, formerly, in the quantity theory, the parameter  $L$  (the liquidity ratio, the amount of money needed for transactions per dollar of nominal GDP) was a constant. In this general model, we assume that  $L$  is a decreasing function of the nominal interest rate  $i$ . Dividing by  $P$ , we can derive the demand for real money balances:

$$
\begin{array}{c c c c} \frac {M ^ {d}}{P} & = & \underbrace {L (i)} _ {\text {A d e c r e a s i n g}} & \times \\ \underset {\text {R e a l m o n e y}} {\text {D e m a n d f o r}} & & \text {f u n c t i o n} & \underset {\text {R e a l i n c o m e}} {\text {R e a l}} \end{array}
$$

Figure 14-11(a) shows a typical real money demand function of this form, with the quantity of real money balances demanded on the horizontal axis and the nominal interest rate on the vertical axis. The downward slope of the demand curve reflects the inverse relationship between the demand for real money balances and the nominal interest rate at a given level of real income  $(Y)$ .

Figure 14-11(b) shows what happens when real income increases from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ . When real income increases (by  $x\%$ ), the demand for real money balances increases (by  $x\%$ ) at each level of the nominal interest rate and the curve shifts.

# Long-Run Equilibrium in the Money Market

The money market is in equilibrium when the real money supply (determined by the central bank) equals the demand for real money balances (determined by the nominal interest rate and real income):

$$
\underset {\text {R e a l m o n e y} \quad \text {s u p p l y}} {\frac {M}{P}} = \underbrace {L (i) Y} _ {\text {R e a l m o n e y} \quad \text {d e m a n d}} \tag {14-7}
$$

(b) Effect of an Increase in Real Income on Real Money Demand

We will continue to assume that prices are flexible in the long run and that they adjust to ensure that equilibrium is maintained.

We now have a model that describes equilibrium in the money market which will help us on the way to understanding the determination of the exchange rate. Before we arrive at the long-run exchange rate, however, we need one last piece to the puzzle. Under the quantity theory, the nominal interest rate was ignored. Now, in our general model, it is a key variable in the determination of money demand. So we need a theory to tell us what the level of the nominal interest rate  $i$  will be in the long run. Once we have solved this problem, we will be able to apply this new, more complex, but more realistic model of the money market to the analysis of exchange rate determination in the long run.

# Inflation and Interest Rates in the Long Run

The tools we need to determine the nominal interest rate in an open economy are already at hand. So far in this chapter, we have developed the idea of purchasing power parity (PPP), which links prices and exchange rates. In the last chapter, we developed another parity idea, uncovered interest parity (UIP), which links exchange rates and interest rates. With only these two relationships in hand, PPP and UIP, we can derive a powerful and striking result concerning interest rates that has profound implications for our study of open economy macroeconomics.

Relative PPP, as indicated in Equation (14-2), states that the rate of depreciation equals the inflation differential at time  $t$ . When market actors use this equation to forecast future exchange rates, we use a superscript  $e$  to denote such expectations. Equation (14-2) is recast to show expected depreciation and inflation at time  $t$ :

$$
\underbrace {\frac {\Delta E _ {\S / \epsilon} ^ {e}}{E _ {\S / \epsilon}}} _ {\text {E V I S T}} = \underbrace {\pi_ {U S} ^ {e} - \pi_ {E U R} ^ {e}} _ {\text {E x p e c t e d i n f l a t i o n d i f f e r e n t i a l}}
$$

Expected rate of dollar depreciation

Next we recall that UIP in the approximate form (Equation 13-3) can be rearranged to show that the expected rate of depreciation equals the interest differential at time  $t$ :

$$
\frac {\Delta E _ {\S / \epsilon} ^ {e}}{E _ {\S / \epsilon}} \hskip 2 8. 4 5 2 7 5 6 p t = \hskip 2 8. 4 5 2 7 5 6 p t i _ {\S} \hskip 2 8. 4 5 2 7 5 6 p t - \hskip 2 8. 4 5 2 7 5 6 p t i _ {\epsilon} \hskip 2 8. 4 5 2 7 5 6 p t
$$

Expected rate of dollar depreciation

Net dollar Net euro interest rate interest rate

This way of writing the UIP equation says that traders will be indifferent to a higher U.S. interest rate relative to the euro interest rates (making U.S. deposits look more attractive) only if the higher U.S. rate is offset by an expected dollar depreciation (making U.S. deposits look less attractive). For example, if the U.S. interest rate is  $4\%$  and the euro interest rate is  $2\%$ , the interest differential is  $2\%$  and the forex market can be in equilibrium only if traders expect a  $2\%$  depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro, which would exactly offset the higher U.S. interest rate.

# The Fisher Effect

Because the left sides of the previous two equations are equal, the right sides must also be equal. Thus, the nominal interest differential equals the expected inflation differential:

$$
\underbrace {i _ {\S} - i _ {\epsilon}} = \underbrace {\pi_ {U S} ^ {e} - \pi_ {E U R} ^ {e}} \tag {14-8}
$$

Nominal interest rate differential

Nominal inflation rate differential (expected)

What does this important result say? To take an example, suppose expected inflation is  $4\%$  in the United States and  $2\%$  in Europe. The inflation differential on the right is then  $+2\%$  ( $4\% - 2\% = +2\%$ ). If interest rates in Europe are  $3\%$ , then to make the interest differential the same as the inflation differential,  $+2\%$ , the interest rate in the United States must equal  $5\%$  ( $5\% - 3\% = +2\%$ ).

Now suppose expected inflation in the United States changes, rising by one percentage point to  $5\%$ . If nothing changes in Europe, then the U.S. interest rate must also rise by one percentage point to  $6\%$  for the equation to hold. In general, this equation predicts that changes in the expected rate of inflation will be fully incorporated (one for one) into changes in nominal interest rates.

All else equal, a rise in the expected inflation rate in a country will lead to an equal rise in its nominal interest rate.

This result is known as the Fisher effect, named for the American economist Irving Fisher (1867-1947). Note that because this result depends on an assumption of PPP, it is therefore likely to hold only in the long run.

The Fisher effect makes clear the link between inflation and interest rates under flexible prices, a finding that is widely applicable. For a start, it makes sense of the evidence we just saw on money holdings during hyperinflations (see Figure 14-10). As inflation rises, the Fisher effect tells us that the nominal interest rate  $i$  must rise by the same amount; the general model of money demand then tells us that  $L(i)$  must fall because it is a decreasing function of  $i$ . Thus, for a given level of real income, real money balances must fall as inflation rises.

In other words, the Fisher effect predicts that the change in the opportunity cost of money is equal not just to the change in the nominal interest rate but also to the change in the inflation rate. In times of very high inflation, people should, therefore, want to reduce their money holdings—and they do.

# Real Interest Parity

As just described, the Fisher effect tells us something about nominal interest rates, but we can quickly derive the implications for real interest rates, too. Rearranging the last equation, we find

$$ i _ {\$} - \pi_ {U S} ^ {e} = i _ {\epsilon} - \pi_ {E U R} ^ {e}

$$

The expressions on either side of this equation might look familiar from previous courses in macroeconomics. When the inflation rate  $(\pi)$  is subtracted from a nominal interest rate  $(i)$ , the result is a real interest rate  $(r)$ , the inflation-adjusted return on an interest-bearing asset. Given this definition, we can simplify the last equation further. On the left is the expected real interest rate in the United States  $(r_{US}^{e} = i_{S} - \pi_{US}^{e})$ . On the right is the expected real interest rate in Europe  $(r_{EUR}^{e} = i_{C} - \pi_{EUR}^{e})$ .

Thus, using only two assumptions, PPP and UIP, we have shown that

$$ r _ {U S} ^ {e} = r _ {E U R} ^ {e} \tag {14-9}
$$

This remarkable result states the following: if PPP and UIP hold, then expected real interest rates are equalized across countries.

This powerful condition is called real interest parity and because it depends on an assumption of PPP, it is therefore likely to hold only in the long run.[10]

We have arrived at a strong conclusion about the potential for globalization to cause convergence in economic outcomes, because real interest parity implies the following: arbitrage in goods and financial markets alone is sufficient, in the long run, to cause the equalization of real interest rates across countries.

We have considered two locations, but this argument applies to all countries integrated into the global capital market. In the long run, they will all share a common expected real interest rate, the long-run expected world real interest rate denoted  $r^{*}$ , so

$$ r _ {U S} ^ {e} = r _ {E U R} ^ {e} = r ^ {*}
$$

From now on, unless indicated otherwise, we treat  $r^*$  as a given, exogenous variable, something outside the control of a policy maker in any particular country.[11]

Under these conditions, the Fisher effect is even clearer, because, by definition,

$$ i _ {\S} = r _ {U S} ^ {e} + \pi_ {U S} ^ {e} = r ^ {*} + \pi_ {U S} ^ {e}
$$

$$ i _ {\epsilon} = r _ {E U R} ^ {e} + \pi_ {E U R} ^ {e} = r ^ {*} + \pi_ {E U R} ^ {e}
$$

Thus, in each country, the long-run expected nominal interest rate is the long-run world real interest rate plus that country's expected long-run inflation rate. For example, if the world real interest rate is  $r^* = 2\%$ , and the country's long-run expected inflation rate goes up by two percentage points from  $3\%$  to  $5\%$ , then its long-run nominal interest rate also goes up by two percentage points from the old level of  $2 + 3 = 5\%$  to a new level of  $2 + 5 = 7\%$ .

# APPLICATION

# Evidence on the Fisher Effect

Are the Fisher effect and real interest parity supported by empirical evidence? One might expect a problem here. We derived them from purchasing power parity. The evidence we have seen on PPP offers support only in the long run. Thus, we do not expect the Fisher effect and real interest parity to hold exactly in the short run, but we might expect them to hold (at least approximately) in the long run.

Figure 14-12 shows that the Fisher effect is close to reality in the long run: on average, countries with higher inflation rates tend to have higher nominal interest rates, and the data line up fairly well with the predictions of the theory. Figure 14-13 shows that, for three developed countries, real interest parity holds fairly well in the long

run: real interest differentials are not always zero, but they tend to fluctuate around zero in the long run. This could be seen as evidence in favor of long-run real interest parity.

# The Fundamental Equation Under the General Model

Now that we understand how the nominal interest rate is determined in the long run, our general model is complete. This model differs from the simple model (the quantity theory) only by allowing  $L$  to vary as a function of the nominal interest rate  $i$ .

We can therefore update our fundamental equations to allow for this change in how we treat  $L$ . For example, the fundamental equation of the monetary approach to exchange rates, Equation (14-3), can now be suitably modified:

$$
\underbrace {E _ {\mathrm {S} / \mathrm {E}}} _ {\text {E x c h a n g e r a t e}} = \underbrace {\frac {P _ {U S}}{P _ {E U R}}} _ {\text {R a t i o o f}} = \underbrace {\frac {\left(\frac {M _ {U S}}{L _ {U S} (i _ {\mathrm {S}}) Y _ {U S}}\right)}{\left(\frac {M _ {E U R}}{L _ {E U R} (i _ {\mathrm {C}}) Y _ {E U R}}\right)}} _ {\text {p r i c e l e v e l s}} = \underbrace {\frac {(M _ {U S} / M _ {E U R})}{\left(L _ {U S} (i _ {\mathrm {S}}) Y _ {U S} / L _ {E U R} (i _ {\mathrm {C}}) Y _ {E U R}\right)}} _ {\text {R e l a t i v e n o m i n a l m o n e y s u p p l i e s}} \tag {14-10}
$$

What have we gained from this refinement? We know that the simple model will remain valid for cases in which nominal interest rates remain unchanged in the long run. It is only when nominal interest rates change that the general model has different implications, and we now have the right tools for that situation. To put those tools to work, we revisit the example of an exchange rate forecasting problem we encountered earlier in this chapter.

# Exchange Rate Forecasts Using the General Model

Earlier in the chapter, we looked at two forecasting problems under the assumption of flexible prices. The first was a one-time unanticipated change in an otherwise constant U.S. money supply. Under the assumptions we made (stable real income in both countries and stable European money supply), this change caused a one-time increase in the U.S. price level but did not lead to a change in U.S. inflation (which was zero before and after the event).

The Fisher effect tells us that if inflation rates are unchanged, then, in the long run, nominal interest rates remain unchanged. Thus, the predictions of the simple model remain valid. But in the second and more complex forecasting problem, there was a one-time unanticipated change in the U.S. money growth rate that did lead to a change in inflation. It is here that the general model makes different predictions.

Earlier we assumed that U.S. and European real income growth rates are identical and equal to zero (0\%), so real income levels are constant. We also assumed that the European money supply is constant, so that the European price level is constant, too. This allowed us to focus on changes on the U.S. side of the model, all else equal.

We now reexamine the forecasting problem for the case in which there is an increase in the U.S. rate of money growth. We learn at time  $T$  that the United States is raising the rate of money supply growth from some fixed rate  $\mu$  to a slightly higher rate  $\mu + \Delta \mu$ .

For example, imagine an increase from  $2\%$  to  $3\%$  growth, so  $\Delta \mu = 1\%$ . How will the exchange rate behave in the long run? To solve the model, we make a provisional assumption that U.S. inflation rates and interest rates are constant before and after time  $T$  and focus on the differences between the two periods caused by the change in money supply growth. The story is told in Figure 14-14: a. The money supply is growing at a constant rate. If the interest rate is constant in each period, then real money balances  $M / P$  remain constant, by assumption, because  $L(i)Y$  is then a constant. If real money balances are constant, then  $M$  and  $P$  grow at the same rate. Before  $T$  that rate is  $\mu = 2\%$ ; after  $T$  that rate is  $\mu + \Delta \mu = 3\%$ . That is, the U.S. inflation rate rises by an amount  $\Delta \mu = 1\%$  at time  $T$ .

b. As a result of the Fisher effect, U.S. interest rates also rise by  $\Delta \mu = 1\%$  at time  $T$ . Consequently, real money balances  $M / P$  must fall at time  $T$  because  $L(i)Y$  will decrease as  $i$  increases.

c. In (a) we have described the path of  $M$ . In (b) we found that  $M / P$  is constant up to  $T$ , then drops suddenly, and then is constant after time  $T$ . What path must the price level  $P$  follow? Up to time  $T$ , it is a constant multiple of  $M$ ; the same applies after time  $T$ , but the constant has increased. Why? The nominal money supply grows smoothly, without a jump. So if real money balances drop down discontinuously at time  $T$ , the price level must jump up discontinuously at time  $T$ . The intuition for this is that the rise in inflation and interest rates at time  $T$  prompts people to instantaneously demand less real money, but because the supply of nominal money is unchanged, the price level has to jump up. Apart from this jump,  $P$  grows at a constant rate; before  $T$  that rate is  $\mu = 2\%$ ; after  $T$  that rate is  $\mu + \Delta \mu = 3\%$ .

d. PPP implies that  $E$  and  $P$  must move in the same proportion, so  $E$  is always a constant multiple of  $P$ . Thus,  $E$  jumps like  $P$  at time  $T$ . Apart from this jump,  $E$  grows at a constant rate; before  $T$  that rate is  $\mu = 2\%$ ; after  $T$  that rate is  $\mu + \Delta \mu = 3\%$ .

(d) Home Exchange Rate,  $E$

An Increase in the Growth Rate of the Money Supply in the Standard Model Before time  $T$ , money, prices, and the exchange rate all grow at rate  $\mu$ . Foreign prices are constant. In panel (a), we suppose at time  $T$  there is an increase  $\Delta \mu$  in the rate of growth of home money supply  $M$ . This causes an increase  $\Delta \mu$  in the rate of inflation; the Fisher effect means that there will be a  $\Delta \mu$  increase in the nominal interest rate; as a result, as shown in panel (b), real money demand falls with a discrete jump at  $T$ . If real money balances are to fall when the nominal money supply expands continuously, then the domestic price level must make a discrete jump up at time  $T$ , as shown in panel (c). Subsequently, prices grow at the new higher rate of inflation; and given the stable foreign price level, PPP implies that the exchange rate follows a similar path to the domestic price level, as shown in panel (d).

Corresponding to these four steps, Figure 14-14 illustrates the path of the key variables in this example. (Our provisional assumption of constant inflation rates and interest rates in each period is satisfied, so the proposed solution is internally consistent.)

Comparing Figure 14-14 with Figure 14-6, we can observe the subtle qualitative differences between the predictions of the simple quantity theory and those of the more general model. Shifts in the interest rate introduce jumps in real money demand. Because money supplies evolve smoothly, these jumps end up being reflected in the price levels and hence—via PPP—in exchange rates. The Fisher effect tells us that these interest rate effects are ultimately the result of changes in expected inflation.

Looking Ahead We can learn a little more by thinking through the market mechanism that produces this result. People learn at time  $T$  that money growth will be more rapid in the United States. This creates expectations of higher inflation in the United States. If people believe PPP holds in the long run, they will believe higher future inflation will cause the U.S. currency to depreciate in the future. This prospect makes holding dollars less attractive, by UIP. People try to sell dollars, and invest in euros. This creates immediate downward pressure on the dollar—even though at time  $T$  itself the supply of dollars does not change at all! This lesson underlines yet again the importance of expectations in determining the exchange rate. Even if actual economic conditions today are completely unchanged, news about the future affects today's exchange rate. This crucial insight can help us explain many phenomena relating to the volatility and instability in spot exchange rates, an idea we develop further in the chapters that follow.

# 5 Monetary Regimes and Exchange Rate Regimes

The monetary approach shows that, in the long run, all nominal variables—the money supply, interest rate, price level, and exchange rate—are interlinked. Hence, monetary policy choices can radically affect some important economic outcomes, notably prices and inflation, about which policy makers, governments, and the people they represent deeply care. The approach therefore highlights issues that must be taken into account in long-run economic policy design, and we will explore these important connections between theory and policy in this final section of the chapter.

We have repeatedly stressed the importance of inflation as an economic variable. Why is it so important? High or volatile inflation rates are considered undesirable. They may destabilize an economy or retard its growth.[12] Economies with low and stable inflation generally grow faster than those with high or volatile inflation. Inflationary crises, in which inflation jumps to a high or hyperinflationary level, are very damaging indeed.[13]

Thus, an overarching aspect of a nation's economic policy is the desire to keep inflation within certain bounds. The achievement of such an objective requires that policy makers be subject to (or subject themselves to) some kind of constraint in the long run. Such constraints are called nominal anchors because they attempt to tie down a nominal variable that is potentially under the policy makers' control.

Policy makers cannot directly control prices, so the attainment of price stability in the short run is not feasible. The question is what can policy makers do to promote price stability in the long run and what types of flexibility, if any, they will allow

12 Macroeconomists can list numerous potential costs of inflation. Expected inflation generates a cost of holding money, a tax on transactions that adds friction to the economy; firms and workers use nominal contracts for prices and would have to change prices and rewrite contracts more often; inflation also distorts the economy when a tax system has significant nominal provisions (e.g., fixed deductions and exemptions). Unexpected inflation creates arbitrary redistributions from creditors to debtors, and this introduces risk into borrowing and lending, making interest rates and investment more costly. In short, if inflation is other than low and stable, economic life becomes at best inconvenient and at worst (as in a hyperinflation) dysfunctional. See N. Gregory Mankiw, 2013, Macroeconomics, 8th ed., Chap. 5 (New York: Worth). This evidence is merely suggestive: high inflation and slow growth may each be caused by other factors, such as weak institutions. Some studies have used sophisticated econometrics to address this problem. See Stanley Fischer, 1993, "The Role of Macroeconomic Factors in Growth," Journal of Monetary Economics, 32, 485-511; Robert J. Barro, 1997, Determinants of Economic Growth (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press); Michael Bruno and William Easterly, 1998, "Inflation Crises and Long-Run Growth," Journal of Monetary Economics, 41, 3-26.

themselves in the short run. Long-run nominal anchoring and short-run flexibility are the characteristics of the policy framework that economists call the monetary regime. In this section, we examine different types of monetary regimes and what they mean for the exchange rate.

# The Long Run: The Nominal Anchor

Which variables could policy makers use as anchors to achieve an inflation objective in the long run? To answer this key question, all we have to do is go back and rearrange the equations for relative PPP at Equation (14-2), the quantity theory in rates of change at Equation (14-6), and the Fisher effect at Equation (14-8), to obtain alternative expressions for the rate of inflation in the home country. To emphasize that these findings apply generally to all countries, we re-label the countries Home (H) and Foreign (F) instead of United States and Europe.

The three main nominal anchor choices that emerge are as follows:

- Exchange rate target: Relative PPP at Equation (14-2) says that the rate of depreciation equals the inflation differential, or  $\Delta E_{H / F} / E_{H / F} = \pi_H - \pi_F$ . Rearranging this expression suggests one way to anchor inflation is as follows:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/de3cf325b04d7e784f9e5ecfa074087e3c9ee645737d01b71a5751ee3b593299.jpg)

Relative PPP says that home inflation equals the rate of depreciation plus foreign inflation. A simple rule would be to set the rate of depreciation equal to a constant. Under a fixed exchange rate, that constant is set at zero (a peg). Under a crawl, it is a nonzero constant. Alternatively, there may be room for movement about a target (a band). Or there may be a vague goal to allow the exchange rate "limited flexibility." Such policies can deliver stable home inflation if PPP works well and if policy makers keep their commitment. The drawback is the final term in the equation: PPP implies that over the long run the home country "imports" inflation from the foreign country over and above the chosen rate of depreciation. For example, under a peg, if foreign inflation rises by  $1\%$  per year, then so, too, does home inflation. Thus, countries almost invariably peg to a country with a reputation for price stability (e.g., the United States). This is a common policy choice: fixed exchange rates of some form are in use in more than half of the world's countries.

Money supply target: The quantity theory suggests another way to anchor because the fundamental equation for the price level in the monetary approach says that inflation equals the excess of the rate of money supply growth over and above the rate of real income growth:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/e302fca53c9d8da9fcf5d58799f6fcdf7bc0009fe99f85a7d5e06e24c3d26321.jpg)

A simple rule of this sort is: set the growth rate of the money supply equal to a constant, say,  $2\%$  a year. The printing presses should be put on automatic pilot, and no human interference should be allowed. Essentially, the central bank is run by robots. This would be difficult to implement. Again the drawback is the final term in the previous equation: real income growth can be unstable. In periods of high growth, inflation will be below the desired level. In periods of low growth, inflation will be above the desired level. For this reason, money supply targets are waning in popularity or are used in conjunction with other targets. For example, the European Central Bank claims to use monetary growth rates as a partial guide to policy, but nobody is quite sure how serious it is.

Inflation target plus interest rate policy: The Fisher effect suggests yet another anchoring method:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/60861111-a690-431a-80eb-af541ac27095/479dbdc39736e24a552465557e2f11c5bd1db6dc6af3d48acc507ec6b2b28683.jpg)

The Fisher effect says that home inflation is the home nominal interest rate minus the foreign real interest rate. If the latter can be assumed to be constant, then as long as the average home nominal interest rate is kept stable, inflation can also be kept stable. This type of nominal anchoring framework is an increasingly common policy choice. Assuming a stable world real interest rate is not a bad assumption. (And in principle, the target level of the nominal interest rate could be adjusted if necessary.) More or less flexible versions of inflation targeting can be implemented. A central bank could in theory set the nominal interest rate at a fixed level at all times, but such rigidity is rarely seen and central banks usually adjust interest rates in the short run to meet other goals. For example, if the world real interest rate is  $r^* = 2.5\%$ , and the country's long-run inflation target is  $2\%$ , then its long-run nominal interest rate ought to be on average equal to  $4.5\%$  (because  $2.5\% = 4.5\% - 2\%$ ). This would be termed the neutral level of the nominal interest rate. But in the short run, the central bank might desire to use some flexibility to set interest rates above or below this neutral level. How much flexibility is a matter of policy choice, as is the question of what economic objectives should drive deviations from the neutral rate (e.g., inflation performance alone, or other factors like output and employment that we shall consider in later chapters).

The Choice of a Nominal Anchor and Its Implications Under the assumptions we have made, any of the three nominal anchor choices are valid. If a particular long-run inflation objective is to be met, then, all else equal, the first equation says it will be consistent with one particular rate of depreciation; the second equation says it will be consistent with one particular rate of money supply growth; the third equation says it will be consistent with one particular rate of interest. But if policy makers announced targets for all three variables, they would be able to match all three consistently only by chance. Two observations follow.

First, using more than one target may be problematic. Under a fixed exchange rate regime, policy makers cannot employ any target other than the exchange rate. However, they may be able to use a mix of different targets if they adopt an intermediate regime,

# TABLE 14-2

Exchange Rate Regimes and Nominal Anchors This table illustrates the possible exchange rate regimes that are consistent with various types of nominal anchors. Countries that are dollarized or in a currency union have a "superfixed" exchange rate target. Pegs, bands, and crawls also target the exchange rate. Managed floats have no preset path for the exchange rate, which allows other targets to be employed. Countries that float freely or independently are judged to pay no serious attention to exchange rate targets; if they have anchors, they will involve monetary targets or inflation targets with an interest rate policy. The countries with "freely falling" exchange rates have no serious target and have high rates of inflation and depreciation. It should be noted that many countries engage in implicit targeting (e.g., inflation targeting) without announcing an explicit target and that some countries may use a mix of more than one target.

Table 14-2 illustrates the ways in which the choice of a target as a nominal anchor affects the choice of exchange rate regime. Obviously, these are not independent choices. But a variety of choices do exist. Thus, nominal anchoring is possible with a variety of exchange rate regimes.

Second, whatever target choice is made, a country that commits to a target as a way of nominal anchoring is committing itself to set future money supplies and interest rates in such a way as to meet the target. Only one path for future policy will be compatible with the target in the long run. Thus, a country with a nominal anchor sacrifices monetary policy autonomy in the long run.

# APPLICATION

# Nominal Anchors in Theory and Practice

An appreciation of the importance of nominal anchors has transformed monetary policy making and inflation performance throughout the global economy in recent decades.

In the 1970s, most of the world was struggling with high inflation. An economic slowdown prompted central banks everywhere to loosen monetary policy. In advanced countries, a move to floating exchange rates allowed great freedom for them to loosen their monetary policy. Developing countries had already proven vulnerable to high inflation and now many of them were exposed to even worse inflation. Those who were pegged to major currencies imported high inflation via PPP. Those who weren't pegged struggled to find a credible nominal anchor as they faced economic downturns of their own. High oil prices everywhere contributed to inflationary pressure.

# TABLE 14-3

Global Disinflation Cross-country data from 1980 to 2012 show the gradual reduction in the annual rate of inflation around the world. This disinflation process began in the advanced economies in the early 1980s. The emerging markets and developing countries suffered from even higher rates of inflation, although these finally began to fall in the 1990s.

In the 1980s, inflationary pressure continued in many developed countries, and in many developing countries high levels of inflation, and even hyperinflations, were not uncommon. Governments were forced to respond to public demands for a more stable inflation environment. In the 1990s, policies designed to create effective nominal anchors were put in place in many countries, and these have endured to the present.

One study found that the use of explicit targets grew markedly in the 1990s, replacing regimes in which there had previously been no explicit nominal anchor. The number of countries in the study with exchange rate targets increased from 30 to 47. The number with money targets increased from 18 to 39. The number with inflation targets increased most dramatically, almost sevenfold, from 8 to 54. Many countries had more than one target in use: in 1998,  $55\%$  of the sample announced an explicit target (or monitoring range) for more than one of the exchange rate, money, and inflation. These shifts have persisted. As of 2010, more than a decade later, there were still more than 50 inflation-targeting countries (many now part of the single Eurozone block), and there were more than 80 countries pursuing some kind of exchange rate target via a currency board, peg, band or crawl type arrangement.[14]

Looking back from the present we can see that most, but not all, of those policies have turned out to be credible, too, thanks to political developments in many countries that have fostered central bank independence. Independent central banks stand apart from the interference of politicians: they have operational freedom to try to achieve the inflation target, and they may even play a role in setting that target.

Overall, these efforts are judged to have achieved some success, although in many countries inflation had already been brought down substantially in the early to mid-1980s before inflation targets and institutional changes were implemented. Table 14-3 shows a steady decline in average levels of inflation since the early 1980s. The lowest levels of inflation are seen in the advanced economies, although developing countries have also started to make some limited progress. In the industrial countries, central bank independence is now commonplace (it was not in the 1970s), but in developing countries it is still relatively rare.

Still, one can have too much of a good thing, and the crisis of 2008-2010 prompted some second thoughts about inflation targets. Typically, such targets have been set at about  $2\%$  in developed countries, and with a world real interest rate of  $2\%$  this implies a neutral nominal interest rate of  $4\%$ . In terms of having room to maneuver, this rate permits central banks to temporarily cut their interest rates up to four percentage points below the neutral level. Prior to the crisis this range was considered ample room for central banks to take short-run actions as needed (e.g., to stimulate output or the rate of inflation if either fell too low). In the crisis, however, central banks soon hit the lower bound of zero rates and could not prevent severe output losses and declines in inflation rates to low or, at times, negative levels (deflation). As Irving Fisher famously noted, deflation is very damaging economically—it drives up real interest rates when nominal rates can fall no further as an offset, and falling prices make the real burden of nominal debts higher. These problems have led some economists, among them the IMF's Chief Economist, Olivier Blanchard, to question whether inflation targets should be set higher (e.g., at  $4\%$  rather than  $2\%$ ). The idea received a lukewarm reception, however: moving to a higher inflation target is easy in principle, but many feared its potential abuse would risk the hard-won credibility gains that central banks have earned for themselves in the last three decades. Indeed, even as inflation rates fell almost to zero in major economies like the United States and Eurozone, many central bankers continued to speak of their vigilance in guarding against inflation.

# 6 Conclusions

This chapter emphasized the determinants of exchange rates in the long run using the monetary approach. We employed PPP and a simple monetary model (the quantity theory) to study an equilibrium in which goods are arbitraged and prices are flexible. Under these assumptions, in the home country, changes in the money supply pass through into proportional changes in the price level and the exchange rate.

We also found that uncovered interest parity and PPP implied that real interest rates are equalized across countries. This helped us develop a monetary model that was more complex—and more realistic—because it allowed money demand to fluctuate in response to changes in the interest rate. In that setting, increases in money growth lead to higher inflation and a higher nominal interest rate and, hence, via decreases in money demand, to even higher price levels. Still, the same basic intuition holds, and one-time changes in the money supply still lead to proportional changes in prices and exchange rates.

The monetary approach to exchange rates provides a basis for certain kinds of forecasting and policy analysis using the flexible-price model in the long run. But such forecasts matter even in the short run because today's spot exchange rate depends, like all asset prices, on the exchange rate expected to prevail in the future. To make these connections clear, in the next chapter we bring together the key ideas of arbitrage (from the previous chapter) and expectations (from this chapter) to form a complete model of the exchange rate.

# KEY POINTS

1. Purchasing power parity (PPP) implies that the exchange rate should equal the relative price level in the two countries, and the real exchange rate should equal 1.
2. Evidence for PPP is weak in the short run but more favorable in the long run. In the short run, deviations are common and changes in the real exchange rate do occur. The failure of PPP in the short run is primarily the result of market frictions, imperfections that limit arbitrage, and price stickiness.
3. A simple monetary model (the quantity theory) explains price levels in terms of money supply levels and real income levels. Because PPP can explain exchange rates in terms of price levels, the two together can be used to develop a monetary approach to the exchange rate.
4. If we can forecast money supply and income, we can use the monetary approach to forecast the level of the exchange rate at any time in the future. However, the monetary approach is valid only under the assumption that prices are flexible. This assumption is more likely to hold in the long run, so the monetary approach is not useful in the short run forecast. Evidence for PPP and the monetary approach is more favorable in the long run.
5. PPP theory, combined with uncovered interest parity, leads to the strong implications of the Fisher effect (interest differentials between countries should equal inflation differentials). The Fisher effect says that changes in local inflation rates pass through one for one into changes in local nominal interest rates. The result implies real interest parity (expected real interest rates should be equalized across countries). Because these results rest on PPP, they should be viewed only as long-run results, and the evidence is somewhat favorable.
6. We can augment the simple monetary model (quantity theory) to allow for the demand for real money balances to decrease as the nominal interest rate rises. This leads to the general monetary model. Its predictions are similar to those of the simple model, except that a one-time rise in money growth rates leads to a one-time rise in inflation, which leads to a one-time drop in real money demand, which in turn causes a one-time jump in the price level and the exchange rate.
7. The monetary approach to exchange rate determination in the long run has implications for economic policy. Policy makers and the public generally prefer a low-inflation environment. Various policies based on exchange rates, money growth, or interest rates have been proposed as nominal anchors. Recent decades have seen a worldwide decline in inflation thanks to the explicit recognition of the need for nominal anchors.

# PROBLEMS

1. Suppose that two countries, Vietnam and Côte d'Ivoire, produce coffee. The currency unit used in Vietnam is the dong (VND). Côte d'Ivoire is a member of Communaute Financière Africaine (CFA), a currency union of West African countries that use the CFA franc (XOF). In Vietnam, coffee sells for 5,000 dong (VND) per pound. The exchange rate is 30 VND per 1 CFA franc,  $E_{\mathrm{VND / XOF}} = 30$ .

a. If the law of one price holds, what is the price of coffee in Côte d'Ivoire, measured in CFA francs?

b. Assume the price of coffee in Côte d'Ivoire is actually 160 CFA francs per pound of coffee. Compute the relative price of coffee in Côte d'Ivoire versus Vietnam. Where will coffee traders buy coffee? Where will they sell coffee in this case? How will these transactions affect the price of coffee in Vietnam? In Côte d'Ivoire?

2. Consider each of the following goods and services. For each, identify whether the law of one price will hold, and state whether the relative price  $q_{US/Foreign}^g$  is greater than, less than, or equal to 1. Explain your answer in terms of the assumptions we make when using the law of one price.

a. Rice traded freely in the United States and Canada b. Sugar traded in the United States and Mexico; the U.S. government imposes a quota on sugar imports into the United States

c. The McDonald's Big Mac sold in the United States and Japan d. Haircuts in the United States and the United Kingdom

3. Use the table that follows to answer this question. Treat the country listed as the home country, and treat the United States as the foreign country. Suppose the cost of the market basket in the United States is  P_{US} = \190 . Check to see whether PPP holds for each of the countries listed, and determine whether we should expect a real appreciation or real depreciation for each country (relative to the United States) in the long run. For the answer, create a table similar to the one shown and fill in the blank cells. (Hint: Use a spreadsheet application such as Excel.)

4. Table 14-1 in the text shows the percentage undervaluation or overvaluation in the Big Mac, based on exchange rates in July 2012. Suppose purchasing power parity holds in the long run, so that these deviations would be expected to disappear. Suppose the local currency prices of the Big Mac remained unchanged. Exchange rates one year later on July 1, 2013, were as follows (Source: ft.com):

<table><tr><td>Country</td><td>Per U.S. $</td></tr><tr><td>Australia (A$)</td><td>1.08</td></tr><tr><td>Brazil (real)</td><td>2.23</td></tr><tr><td>Canada (C$)</td><td>1.05</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark (krone)</td><td>5.72</td></tr><tr><td>Eurozone (euro)</td><td>0.77</td></tr><tr><td>India (rupee)</td><td>59.43</td></tr><tr><td>Japan (yen)</td><td>99.75</td></tr><tr><td>Mexico (peso)</td><td>12.89</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden (krona)</td><td>6.67</td></tr></table>

Based on these data and Table 14-1, calculate the change in the exchange rate from July 2012 to July 2013, and state whether the direction of change was consistent with the PPP-implied exchange rate using the Big Mac Index. How might you explain the failure of the Big Mac Index to correctly predict the change in the nominal exchange rate between July 2012 and July 2013?

5. You are given the following information. The current dollar-pound exchange rate is \$2 per pound. A U.S. basket that costs \$100 would cost 120 in the United Kingdom. For the next year, the Fed is predicted to keep U.S. inflation at 2\% and the Bank of England is predicted to keep U.K. inflation at 3\%. The speed of convergence to absolute PPP is 15\% per year.

a. What is the expected U.S. minus U.K. inflation differential for the coming year?

b. What is the current U.S. real exchange rate  $q_{\mathrm{US/UK}}$  with the United Kingdom?

c. How much is the dollar overvalued/undervalued?

d. What do you predict the U.S. real exchange rate with the United Kingdom will be in one year's time?

e. What is the expected rate of real depreciation for the United States (versus the United Kingdom)?

f. What is the expected rate of nominal depreciation for the United States (versus the United Kingdom)?

g. What do you predict will be the dollar price of one pound a year from now?

6. Describe how each of the following factors might explain why PPP is a better guide for exchange rate movements in the long run versus the short run: (i) transactions costs, (ii) nontraded goods, (iii) imperfect competition, (iv) price stickiness. As markets become increasingly integrated, do you suspect PPP will become a more useful guide in the future? Why or why not?
7. Consider two countries: Japan and Korea. In 1996 Japan experienced relatively slow output growth  $(1\%)$ , while Korea had relatively robust output growth  $(6\%)$ . Suppose the Bank of Japan allowed the money supply to grow by  $2\%$  each year, while the Bank of Korea chose to maintain relatively high money growth of  $12\%$  per year.

For the following questions, use the simple monetary model (where  $L$  is constant). You will find it easiest to treat Korea as the home country and Japan as the foreign country.

a. What is the inflation rate in Korea? In Japan?

b. What is the expected rate of depreciation in the Korean won relative to the Japanese yen (¥)?

c. Suppose the Bank of Korea increases the money growth rate from  $12\%$  to  $15\%$ . If nothing in Japan changes, what is the new inflation rate in Korea?

d. Using time series diagrams, illustrate how this increase in the money growth rate affects the money supply  $M_{\mathrm{K}}$ , Korea's interest rate, prices  $P_{\mathrm{K}}$ , real money supply, and  $E_{\mathrm{won}/\yen}$  over time. (Plot each variable on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.) e. Suppose the Bank of Korea wants to maintain an exchange rate peg with the Japanese yen. What money growth rate would the Bank of Korea have to choose to keep the value of the won fixed relative to the yen?

f. Suppose the Bank of Korea sought to implement policy that would cause the Korean won to appreciate relative to the Japanese yen. What ranges of the money growth rate (assuming positive values) would allow the Bank of Korea to achieve this objective?

8. This question uses the general monetary model, where  $L$  is no longer assumed constant, and money demand is inversely related to the nominal interest rate. Consider the same scenario described at the beginning of the previous question. In addition, the bank deposits in Japan pay a  $3\%$  interest rate,  $i_{\mathrm{Y}} = 3\%$ .

a. Compute the interest rate paid on Korean deposits.

b. Using the definition of the real interest rate (nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation), show that the real interest rate in Korea is equal to the real interest rate in Japan. (Note that the inflation rates you computed in the previous question will be the same in this question.) c. Suppose the Bank of Korea increases the money growth rate from  $12\%$  to  $15\%$  and the inflation rate rises proportionately (one for one) with this increase. If the nominal interest rate in Japan remains unchanged, what happens to the interest rate paid on Korean deposits?

d. Using time series diagrams, illustrate how this increase in the money growth rate affects the money supply  $M_{\mathrm{K}}$ ; Korea's interest rate; prices  $P_{\mathrm{K}}$ ; real money supply; and  $E_{\mathrm{won / \Psi}}$  over time. (Plot each variable on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.)

9. Both advanced economics and developing countries have experienced a decrease in inflation since the 1980s (see Table 14-3 in the text). This question considers how the choice of policy regime has influenced such global disinflation. Use the monetary model to answer this question.

a. The Swiss Central Bank currently targets its money growth rate to achieve policy objectives. Suppose Switzerland has output growth of  $3\%$  and money growth of  $8\%$  each year. What is Switzerland's inflation rate in this case? Describe how the Swiss Central Bank could achieve an inflation rate of  $2\%$  in the long run through the use of a nominal anchor.

b. Like the Federal Reserve, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand uses an interest rate target.

Suppose the Reserve Bank of New Zealand maintains a  $6\%$  interest rate target and the world real interest rate is  $1.5\%$ . What is the New Zealand inflation rate in the long run? In 1997 New Zealand adopted a policy agreement that required the bank to maintain an inflation rate no higher than  $2.5\%$ . What interest rate targets would achieve this objective?

c. The central bank of Lithuania maintains an exchange rate band relative to the euro. This is a prerequisite for joining the Eurozone. Lithuania must keep its exchange rate within  $\pm 15\%$  of the central parity of 3.4528 litas per euro. Compute the exchange rate values corresponding to the upper and lower edges of this band. Suppose PPP holds. Assuming Eurozone inflation is currently  $2\%$  per year and inflation in Lithuania is  $5\%$ , compute the rate of depreciation of the lita. Will Lithuania be able to maintain the band requirement? For how long? Does your answer depend on where in the band the exchange rate currently sits? A primary objective of the European Central Bank is price stability (low inflation) in the current and future Eurozone. Is an exchange rate band a necessary or sufficient condition for the attainment of this objective?

10. Several countries that have experienced hyperinflation adopt dollarization as a way to control domestic inflation. For example, Ecuador has used the U.S. dollar as its domestic currency since 2000. What does dollarization imply about the exchange rate between Ecuador and the United States? Why might countries experiencing hyperinflation adopt dollarization? Why might they do this rather than just fixing their exchange rate?
11. You are the central banker for a country that is considering the adoption of a new nominal anchor. When you take the position as chairperson, the inflation rate is  $4\%$  and your position as the central bank chairperson requires that you achieve a  $2.5\%$  inflation target within the next year. The economy's growth in real output is currently  $3\%$ . The world real interest rate is currently  $1.5\%$ . The currency used in your country is the lira. Assume prices are flexible.

a. Why is having a nominal anchor important for you to achieve the inflation target? What is the drawback of using a nominal anchor?

b. What is the growth rate of the money supply in this economy? If you choose to adopt a money supply target, which money supply growth rate will allow you to meet your inflation target?

c. Suppose the inflation rate in the United States is currently  $2\%$  and you adopt an exchange rate target relative to the U.S. dollar. Compute the percent appreciation/depreciation in the lira needed for you to achieve your inflation target. Will the lira appreciate or depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar?

d. Your final option is to achieve your inflation target using interest rate policy. Using the Fisher equation, compute the current nominal interest rate in your country. What nominal interest rate will allow you to achieve the inflation target?

The Big Mac Index isn't the only popular PPP gauge. In 2004, the Economist made a Starbucks Tall Latte Index, which you can try to find online. (Hint: Search "cnn tall latte index.") In 2007, two new indices appeared: the iPod Index (based on the local prices of Apple's iPod music player) and iTunes Index (based on the local prices of a single song downloaded from Apple's iTunes store). Find those indices online and the discussions surrounding them. (Hint: Search "ipod iTunes index big mac.") Do you think that either the iPod Index or iTunes Index is a better guide to currency overvaluation/undervaluation than the Big Mac Index? Explain your answer.

Visit the websites of some central banks around the world, for example, the U.S. Federal Reserve (http://www.federalreserve.gov/) and the European Central Bank (http://www.ecb.int/). Read their main statements of policy. Try to find out what their policy goals are in the long run. Who sets them? Is there more than one goal? What about a nominal anchor—Is controlling inflation a long-run goal? If so, what policy is used to try to ensure that the long-run inflation goal will be met? In the short run, is the main tool they use for implementing their policy the quantity of money, the exchange rate, or the interest rate?
