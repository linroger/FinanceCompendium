# National and International Accounts: Income, Wealth, and the Balance of Payments

Money is sent from one country to another for various purposes: such as the payment of tributes or subsidies; remittances of revenue to or from dependencies, or of rents or other incomes to their absent owners; emigration of capital, or transmission of it for foreign investment. The most usual purpose, however, is that of payment for goods. To show in what circumstances money actually passes from country to country for this or any of the other purposes mentioned, it is necessary briefly to state the nature of the mechanism by which international trade is carried on, when it takes place not by barter but through the medium of money.

John Stuart Mill, 1848

In Chapter 13, we encountered George, the hypothetical American tourist in Paris. We learned about his use of exchange rate conversion—but how did he pay for his expenses? He traded some of his assets (such as dollars converted into euros, or charges on his debit card against his bank account) for goods and services (hotel, food, wine, etc.). Every day households and firms routinely trade goods, services, and assets, but when such transactions cross borders, they link the home economy with the rest of the world. In the upcoming chapters, we study economic transactions between countries, how they are undertaken, and the impact they have on the macroeconomy.

To that end, the first task of any macroeconomist is to measure economic transactions. The collection and analysis of such data can help improve research and policymaking. In a closed economy there are important aggregate flows to consider, such as national output, consumption, investment, and so on. When an economy is open to transactions with the rest of the world, there are a host of additional economic transactions that take place across borders. In today's world economy these international flows of trade and finance have reached unprecedented levels.

Beyond barter: International transactions involve not just goods and services but also financial assets.

Cross-border flows of goods, services, and capital are measured in various ways and are increasingly important subjects of discussion for economists and policy makers, for businesses, and for the well-educated citizen. There are debates about the size of the U.S. trade deficit, trade surpluses in emerging economies like China and India, the growing indebtedness of the United States to the rest of the world, and how these trends might be related to national saving and the government's budget. To understand such debates, we must first know what is being talked about. What do all these measures mean and how are they related? How does the global economy actually function?

The goals of this chapter are to explain the international system of trade and payments, to discover how international trade in goods and services is complemented and balanced by a parallel trade in assets, and to see how these transactions relate to national income and wealth. In the remainder of the book, we use these essential tools to understand the macroeconomic links between nations.

# 1 Measuring Macroeconomic Activity: An Overview

To understand macroeconomic accounting in an open economy, we build on the principles used to track payments in a closed economy. As you may recall from previous courses in economics, a closed economy is characterized by a circular flow of payments, in which economic resources are exchanged for payments as they move through the economy. At various points in this flow, economic activity is measured and recorded in the national income and product accounts. In an open economy, however, such measurements are more complicated because we have to account for cross-border flows. These additional flows are recorded in a nation's balance of payments accounts. In this opening section, we survey the principles behind these measurements. In later sections, we define the measurements more precisely and explore how they work in practice.

# The Flow of Payments in a Closed Economy: Introducing the National Income and Product Accounts

Figure 16-1 shows how payments flow in a closed economy. At the top is gross national expenditure (GNE), the total expenditure on final goods and services by home entities in any given period of measurement (usually a calendar year, unless otherwise noted). It is made up of three parts: personal consumption  $C$ , investment  $I$ , and government spending  $G$ . The sum of these variables equals GNE.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/8fb43f4b9d3e8bd0673419de6e5b4b856f60fcb1e7a389be5ae7e367ea8d0309.jpg)

FIGURE 16-1

Once GNE is spent, where do the payments flow next? All of this spending constitutes all payments for final goods and services within the nation's borders. Because the economy is closed, the nation's expenditure must be spent on the final goods and services it produces. More specifically, a country's gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of all (intermediate and final) goods and services produced as output by firms, minus the value of all intermediate goods and services purchased as inputs by firms. (GDP is also known as value added.) GDP is a product measure, in contrast to GNE, which is an expenditure measure. In a closed economy, intermediate sales must equal intermediate purchases, so in GDP these two terms cancel out, leaving only the value of final goods and services produced, which equals the expenditure on final goods and services, or GNE. Thus, GDP equals GNE.

Once GDP is sold, where do the payments flow next? Because GDP measures the value of firm outputs minus the cost of firm inputs, and this remaining flow is paid by firms as income to factors such as the owners of labor, capital, and land employed by the firms. The factors may, in turn, be owned by households, government, or firms, but such distinctions are not important. The key thing in a closed economy is that all such income is paid to domestic entities. It thus equals the total income resources of the economy, also known as gross national income (GNI). By this point in our circular flow, we can see that in a closed economy the expenditure on total goods and services GNE equals GDP, which is then paid as income to productive factors GNI.

Once GNI is received by factors, where do the payments flow next? Clearly, there is no way for a closed economy to finance expenditure except out of its own income, so total income is, in turn, spent and must be the same as total expenditure. This is shown by the loop that flows back to the top of Figure 16-1. What we have seen in our tour around the circular flow is that in a closed economy, all the economic aggregate measures are equal: GNE equals GDP which equals GNI which equals GNE. In a closed economy, expenditure is the same as product, which is the same as income. Our understanding of the closed economy circular flow is complete.

# The Flow of Payments in an Open Economy: Incorporating the Balance of Payments Accounts

The closed-economy circular flow shown in Figure 16-1 is simple and tidy. When a nation opens itself to trade with other nations, however, the flow becomes a good deal more complicated. Figure 16-2 incorporates all of the extra payment flows to and from the rest of the world, which are recorded in a nation's balance of payments (BOP) accounts.

The circulating purple arrows on the left side of the figure are just as in the closed-economy case in Figure 16-1. These arrows flow within the purple box, which represents the home country, and do not cross the edge of that box, which represents the international border. The cross-border flows that occur in an open economy are represented by green arrows. There are five key points on the figure where these flows appear.

As before, we start at the top with the home economy's gross national expenditure,  $C + I + G$ . In an open economy, some home expenditure is used to purchase foreign final goods and services. At point 1, these imports are subtracted from home GNE because those goods are not sold by domestic firms. In addition, some foreign expenditure is used to purchase final goods and services from home. These exports must be added to home GNE because those goods are sold by domestic firms. (A similar logic applies to intermediate goods.) The difference between payments made for imports and payments received for exports is called the trade balance (TB), and it equals net payments to domestic firms due to trade. GNE plus TB equals GDP, the total value of production in the home economy.

At point 2, some home GDP is paid to foreign entities for factor service imports, that is, domestic payments to capital, labor, and land owned by foreign entities. Because this income is not paid to factors at home, it is subtracted when computing home income. Similarly, some foreign GDP may be paid to domestic entities as payment for factor service exports, that is, foreign payments to capital, labor, and land owned by domestic entities. Because this income is paid to factors at home, it is added when computing home income. The value of factor service exports minus factor service imports is known as net factor income from abroad (NFIA). Thus GDP plus NFIA equals GNI, the total income earned by domestic entities from all sources, domestic and foreign.

At point 3, we see that the home country may not retain all of its earned income GNI. Why? Domestic entities might give some of it away—for example, as foreign aid or remittances by migrants to their families back home. Similarly, domestic enti

FIGURE 16-2

The Open Economy Measurements of national expenditure, product, and income are recorded in the national income and product accounts, with the major categories shown on the left. Measurements of international transactions are recorded in the balance of payments accounts, with the major categories shown on the right. The purple line shows the flow of transactions within the home economy; the green lines show all cross-border transactions.

ties might receive gifts from abroad. Such gifts may take the form of income transfers or be "in kind" transfers of goods and services. They are considered nonmarket transactions, and are referred to as unilateral transfers. Net unilateral transfers (NUT) equals the value of unilateral transfers the country receives from the rest of the world minus those it gives to the rest of the world. These net transfers are added to GNI to calculate gross national disposable income (GNDI). Thus GNI plus NUT equals GNDI, which represents the total income resources available to the home country.

The balance of payments accounts collect the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers and report their sum as the current account (CA), a tally of all international transactions in goods, services, and income that occur through market transactions or transfers. The current account is not, however, a complete picture of international transactions. Resource flows of goods, services, and income are not the only items that flow between open economies. Financial assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate are also traded across international borders.

At point 4, we see that a country's capacity to spend is not restricted to be equal to its GNDI, but instead can be increased or decreased by trading assets with other countries. When foreign entities pay to acquire assets from home entities, the value of these asset exports increases resources available for spending at home. Conversely, when domestic entities pay to acquire assets from the rest of the world, the value of the asset imports decreases resources available for spending. The value of asset exports minus asset imports is called the financial account (FA). These net asset exports are added to home GNDI when calculating the total resources available for expenditure in the home country.

Finally, at point 5, we see that a country may not only buy and sell assets but also transfer assets as gifts. Such asset transfers are measured by the capital account (KA), which is the value of capital transfers from the rest of the world minus those to the rest of the world. These net asset transfers are also added to home GNDI when calculating the total resources available for expenditure in the home country.

After some effort, at the bottom of Figure 16-2, we have finally computed the total value of all the resources that are available for the home country to use for spending, or gross national expenditure, as the flow loops back to the top. We have now fully modified the circular flow to account for international transactions.

These modifications to the circular flow in Figure 16-2 tell us something very important about the balance of payments. We start at the top with GNE. We add the trade balance to get GDP, we add net factor income from abroad to get GNI, and then we add net unilateral transfers received to get GNDI. We then add net asset exports measured by the financial account and net capital transfers measured by the capital account, and we get back to GNE. That is, we start with GNE, add in everything in the balance of payments accounts, and still end up with GNE. What does this tell us? The sum of all the items in the balance of payments account, the net sum of all those cross-border flows, must amount to zero! The balance of payments account does balance. We explore the implications of this important result later in this chapter.

# 2 Income, Product, and Expenditure

In the previous section, we sketched out all the important national and international transactions that occur in an open economy. With that overview in mind, we now formally define the key accounting concepts in the two sets of accounts and put them to use.

# Three Approaches to Measuring Economic Activity

There are three main approaches to the measurement of aggregate economic activity within a country:

The expenditure approach looks at the demand for goods: it examines how much is spent on demand for final goods and services. The key measure is gross national expenditure GNE.

The product approach looks at the supply of goods: it measures the value of all goods and services produced as output minus the value of goods used as inputs in production. The key measure is gross domestic product GDP.

The income approach focuses on payments to owners of factors and tracks the amount of income they receive. The key measures are gross national income GNI and gross national disposable income GNDI (which includes net transfers).

It is crucial to note that in a closed economy the three approaches generate the same number: In a closed economy,  $GNE = GDP = GNI$ . In an open economy, however, this is not true.

# From GNE to GDP: Accounting for Trade in Goods and Services

As before, we start with gross national expenditure, or GNE, which is by definition the sum of consumption  $C$ , investment  $I$ , and government consumption  $G$ . Formally, these three elements are defined, respectively, as follows:

- Personal consumption expenditures (usually called "consumption") equal total spending by private households on final goods and services, including nondurable goods such as food, durable goods such as a television, and services such as window cleaning or gardening.
- Gross private domestic investment (usually called "investment") equals total spending by firms or households on final goods and services to make additions to the stock of capital. Investment includes construction of a new house or a new factory, the purchase of new equipment, and net increases in inventories of goods held by firms (i.e., unsold output).
- Government consumption expenditures and gross investment (often called "government consumption") equal spending by the public sector on final goods and services, including spending on public works, national defense, the police, and the civil service. It does not include any transfer payments or income redistributions, such as Social Security or unemployment insurance payments—these are not purchases of goods or services, just rearrangements of private spending power.

As for GDP, it is by definition the value of all goods and services produced as output by firms, minus the value of all intermediate goods and services purchased as inputs by firms. It is thus a product measure, in contrast to the expenditure measure GNE. Because of trade, not all of the GNE payments go to GDP, and not all of GDP payments arise from GNE.

To adjust GNE and find the contribution going into GDP, we subtract the value of final goods imported (home spending that goes to foreign firms) and add the value of final goods exported (foreign spending that goes to home firms). In addition, we can't forget about intermediate goods: we subtract the value of imported intermediates (in GDP they also count as home's purchased inputs) and add the value of exported intermediates (in GDP they also count as home's produced output). So, adding it all up, to get from GNE to GDP, we add the value of all exports denoted  $EX$  and subtract the value of all imports  $IM$ . Thus,

$$
\underbrace {G D P} _ {\text {G r o s s d o m e s t i c p r o d u c t}} = \underbrace {C + I + G} _ {\text {G r o s s n a t i o n a l e x p e n d i t u r e}} + \underbrace {\left(\underbrace {E X} _ {\text {A l l e x p o r t s , f i n a l & i n t e r m i d a t e}} - \underbrace {I M} _ {\text {A l l i m p o r t s , f i n a l & i n t e r m i d a t e}}\right)} _ {\text {T r a d e b a l a n c e} T B} \tag {16-1}
$$

This important formula for GDP says that gross domestic product is equal to gross national expenditure (GNE) plus the trade balance (TB).

It is important to understand and account for intermediate goods transactions properly because trade in intermediate goods has surged in recent decades due to globalization and outsourcing. For example, according to the 2010 Economic Report of the President, estimates suggest that one-third of the growth of world trade from 1970 to 1990 was driven by intermediate trade arising from the growth of "vertically specialized" production processes (outsourcing, offshoring, etc.). More strikingly, as of 2010, it appears that—probably for the first time in world history—total world trade now consists more of trade in intermediate goods  $(60\%)$  than in final goods  $(40\%)$ .

The trade balance TB is also called net exports. Because it is the net value of exports minus imports, it may be positive or negative.

If  $TB > 0$ , exports are greater than imports and we say a country has a trade surplus.

If  $TB < 0$ , imports are greater than imports and we say a country has a trade deficit.

In 2012, the United States had a trade deficit because exports  X  were 2,184 billion and imports  M  were 2,744 billion. Thus its trade balance was equal to -560 billion.

# From GDP to GNI: Accounting for Trade in Factor Services

Trade in factor services occurs when, say, the home country is paid income by a foreign country as compensation for the use of labor, capital, and land owned by home entities but in service in the foreign country. We say the home country is exporting factor services to the foreign country and receiving factor income in return.

An example of a labor service export is a home country professional temporarily working overseas, say, a U.S. architect freelancing in London. The wages she earns in the United Kingdom are factor income for the United States. An example of trade in capital services is foreign direct investment. For example, U.S.-owned factories in Ireland generate income for their U.S. owners; Japanese-owned factories in the United States generate income for their Japanese owners. Other examples of payments for capital services include income from overseas financial assets such as foreign securities, real estate, or loans to governments, firms, and households.

These payments are accounted for as additions to and subtractions from home GDP. Some home GDP is paid out as income payments to foreign entities for factor services imported by the home country  $IM_{FS}$ . In addition, domestic entities receive some income payments from foreign entities as income receipts for factor services exported by the home country  $EX_{FS}$ .

After accounting for these income flows, we see that gross national income (GNI), the total income earned by domestic entities, is  $GDP$  plus the factor income arriving from overseas  $EX_{FS}$ , minus the factor income going out overseas  $IM_{FS}$ . The last two terms, income receipts minus income payments, are the home country's net factor income from abroad,  $NFIA = EX_{FS} - IM_{FS}$ . This may be a positive or negative number, depending on whether income receipts are larger or smaller than income payments.

With the help of the GDP expression in Equation (16-1), we obtain the key formula for GNI that says the gross national income equals gross domestic product (GDP) plus net factor income from abroad (NFIA).

$$
\begin{array}{r l} G N I & = \underbrace {C + I + G} _ {\text {G r o s s n a t i o n a l e x p e n d i t u r e}} + \underbrace {(E X - I M)} _ {\text {T r a d e b a l i n c e}} \\ & \underbrace {G N E} _ {G D P} \end{array} + \underbrace {(E X _ {F S} - I M _ {F S})} _ {\text {N e t f a c t o r i n c o m e f r o m a b r o a d}} \tag {16-2}
$$

In 2012 the United States received income payments from foreigners  $EX_{FS}$  of \$782 billion and made income payments to foreigners  $IM_{FS}$  of \$539 billion, so the net factor income from abroad NFLA was +243 billion.

# APPLICATION

# Celtic Tiger or Tortoise?

International trade in factor services (as measured by NFIA) can generate a difference between the product and income measures in a country's national accounts. In the United States, this difference is typically small, but at times NFIA can play a major role in the measurement of a country's economic activity.

In the 1970s, Ireland was one of the poorer countries in Europe, but over the next three decades it experienced speedy economic growth with an accompanying investment boom now known as the Irish Miracle. From 1980 to 2007, Irish real GDP per person grew at a phenomenal rate of  $4.1\%$  per year—not as rapid as in some developing countries but extremely rapid by the standards of the rich countries of the European Union (EU) or the

Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Comparisons with fast-growing Asian economies—the "Asian Tigers"—soon had people speaking of the "Celtic Tiger" when referring to Ireland. Despite a large recession after the 2008 crisis, real GDP per person in Ireland is still almost three times its 1980 level.

But did Irish citizens enjoy all of these gains? No. Figure 16-3 shows that in 1980 Ireland's annual net factor income from abroad was virtually nil—about €120 per person (in year 2000 real euros) or  $+0.9\%$  of GDP. Yet by 2000, and in the years since, around  $15\%$  to  $20\%$  of Irish GDP was being used to make net factor income payments to foreigners who had invested heavily in the Irish economy by buying stocks and bonds and by purchasing land and building factories on it. (By some estimates,  $75\%$  of Ireland's industrial-sector GDP originated in foreign-owned plants in 2004.) These foreign investors expected their big Irish investments to generate income, and so they did, in the form of net factor payments abroad amounting to almost one-fifth of Irish GDP. This meant that Irish GNI (the income paid to Irish people and firms) was a lot smaller than Irish GDP. Ireland's net factor income from abroad has remained large and negative ever since.

FIGURE 16-3

A Paper Tiger? The chart shows trends in GDP, GNI, and NFIA in Ireland from 1980 to 2011. Irish GNI per capita grew more slowly than GDP per capita during the boom years of the 1980s and 1990s because an ever-larger share of GDP was sent abroad as net factor income to foreign investors. Close to zero in 1980, this share had risen to around  $15\%$  of GDP by the year 2000 and has remained at approximately that level ever since.

Sources: OECD and IMF.

This example shows how GDP can be a misleading measure of economic performance. When ranked by GDP per person, Ireland was the 4th richest OECD economy in 2004; when ranked by GNI per person, it was only 17th richest. The Irish outflow of net factor payments is certainly an extreme case, but it serves to underscore an important point about income measurement in open economies. Any country that relies heavily on foreign investment to generate economic growth is not getting a free lunch. Irish GNI per person grew at "only"  $3.6\%$  from 1980 to the peak in 2007; this was  $0.5\%$  per year less than the growth rate of GDP per person over the same period. Living standards grew impressively, but the more humble GNI figures may give a more accurate measure of what the Irish Miracle actually meant for the Irish.

# From GNI to GNDI: Accounting for Transfers of Income

So far, we have fully described market transactions in goods, services, and income. However, many international transactions take place outside of markets. International nonmarket transfers of goods, services, and income include such things as foreign aid by governments in the form of official development assistance (ODA) and other help, private charitable gifts to foreign recipients, and income remittances sent to relatives or friends in other countries. These transfers are "gifts" and may take the form of goods and services (food aid, volunteer medical services) or income transfers.

If a country receives transfers worth  $UT_{IN}$  and gives transfers worth  $UT_{OUT}$ , then its net unilateral transfers,  $NUT$ , are  $NUT = UT_{IN} - UT_{OUT}$ . Because this is a net amount, it may be positive or negative. In the year 2012, the United States had net unilateral transfers of 157 billion to the rest of the world. In general, net unilateral transfers play a small role in the income and product accounts for most high-income countries (net outgoing transfers are typically no more than 5\% of GNI). But they are an important part of the gross national disposable income (GNDI) for many low-income countries that receive a great deal of foreign aid or migrant remittances, as seen in Figure 16-4.

Measuring national generosity is highly controversial and a recurring theme of current affairs (see Headlines: Are Rich Countries "Stingy" with Foreign Aid?). You might think that net unilateral transfers are in some ways a better measure of a country's generosity toward foreigners than official development assistance, which is but one component. For example, looking at the year 2000, a USAID report, *Foreign Aid in the National Interest*, claimed that while U.S. ODA was only \$9.9 billion, other U.S. government assistance (such as contributions to global security and humanitarian assistance) amounted to \$12.7 billion, and assistance from private U.S. citizens totaled \$33.6 billion—for total foreign assistance equal to \$56.2 billion, more than five times the level of ODA.

To include the impact of aid and all other transfers in the overall calculation of a country's income resources, we add net unilateral transfers to gross national income. Using the definition of GNI in Equation (16-2), we obtain a full measure of national income in an open economy, known as gross national disposable income (GNDI), henceforth denoted  $Y$ :

$$
\underbrace {Y} = \underbrace {C + I + G} + \underbrace {(E X - I M)} + \underbrace {(E X _ {F S} - I M _ {F S})} + \underbrace {(U T _ {I N} - U T _ {O U T})} \tag {16-3}

Major Transfer Recipients The chart shows average figures for the decade 2001 to 2010 for all countries in which average net unilateral transfers exceeded  $15\%$  of GNI. Many of the countries shown were heavily reliant on foreign aid, including some of the poorest countries in the world, such as Liberia, Eritrea, Malawi, and Nepal. Some countries with higher incomes also have large transfers because of substantial migrant remittances from a large number of emigrant workers overseas (e.g., Tonga, El Salvador, Honduras, and Cape Verde).

In general, economists and policy makers prefer to use GNDI to measure national income. Why? GDP is not a true measure of income because, unlike GNI, it does not include net factor income from abroad. GNI is not a perfect measure either because it leaves out international transfers. GNDI is a preferred measure because it most closely corresponds to the resources available to the nation's households, and national welfare depends most closely on this accounting measure.

# What the National Economic Aggregates Tell Us

We have explained all the international flows shown in Figure 16-2 and have developed three key equations that link the important national economic aggregates in an open economy:

To get from GNE to GDP, we add TB (Equation 16-1).

# HEADLINES

# Are Rich Countries "Stingy" with Foreign Aid?

The Asian tsunami on December 26, 2004, was one of worst natural disasters of modern times. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed and billions of dollars of damage was done. Some aftershocks were felt in international politics. Jan Egeland, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, declared, "It is beyond me why we are so stingy." His comments rocked the boat in many rich countries, especially in the United States where official aid fell short of the UN goal of  $0.7\%$  of GNI. However, the United States gives in other ways, making judgments about stinginess far from straightforward.

Is the United States stingy when it comes to foreign aid? … The answer depends on how you measure…

In terms of traditional foreign aid, the United States gave  \$16.25 billion in 2003, as measured by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the club of the world's rich industrial nations. That was almost double the aid by the next biggest net spender, Japan (\$ 8.8 billion). Other big donors were France (\$7.2 billion) and Germany (\$6.8 billion).

But critics point out that the United States is much bigger than those individual nations. As a group, member nations of the European Union have a bit larger population than the United States and give a great deal more money in foreign aid—49.2 billion altogether in 2003.

In relation to affluence, the United States lies at the bottom of the list of rich donor nations. It gave  $0.15\%$  of gross national income to official development assistance in 2003. By this measure, Norway at  $0.92\%$  was the most generous, with Denmark next at  $0.84\%$ .

Bring those numbers down to an everyday level and the average American gave 13 cents a day in government aid, according to David Roodman, a researcher at the Center for Global Development (CGD) in Washington. Throw in another nickel a day from private giving. That private giving is high by international standards, yet not enough to close the gap with Norway, whose citizens average 1.02 per day in government aid and 24 cents per day in private aid…

To get from GDP to GNI, we add NFIA (Equation 16-2).

To get from GNI to GDNI, we add NUT (Equation 16-3).

To go one step further, we can group the three cross-border terms into an umbrella term that is called the current account CA:

$$
\underbrace {Y} _ {G N D I} = \underbrace {C + I + G} _ {G N E} + \underbrace {\{\left(E X - I M\right)} _ {T B} + \underbrace {\left(E X _ {F S} - I M _ {F S}\right)} _ {N F I A} + \underbrace {\left(U T _ {I N} - U T _ {O U T}\right)} _ {N U T} \} \tag {16-4}
$$

Current account

CA

It is important to understand the intuition for this expression. On the left is our full income measure, GNDI. The first term on the right is GNE, which measures payments by home entities. The other terms on the right, combined into CA, measure all net payments to the home country arising from the full range of international transactions in goods, services, and income.

Remember that in a closed economy, there are no international transactions so TB and NFIA and NUT (and hence CA) are all zero. Therefore, in a closed economy, the four main aggregates GNDI, GNI, GDP, and GNE are exactly equal. In an open economy, however, each of these four aggregates can differ from the others.

# Understanding the Data for the National Economic Aggregates

Now that we've learned how a nation's principal economic aggregates are affected by international transactions in theory, let's see how this works in practice. In this section, we take a look at some data from the real world to see how they are recorded and presented in official statistics.

Table 16-1 shows data for the United States in 2012 reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the official national income and product accounts.

Lines 1 to 3 of the table show the components of gross national expenditure GNE. Personal consumption expenditures  C  were 11,120 billion, gross private domestic investment  I  was 2,062 billion, and government consumption  G  was 3,063 billion. Summing up, GNE was 16,245 billion (line 4).

Line 5 shows the trade balance  TB , the net export of goods and services, which was -\560 billion. (Net exports are negative because the United States imported more goods and services than it exported.) Adding this to GNE gives gross domestic

Adding this to GDP gives gross national income GNI of 15,928 billion (line 8).

Finally, to get to the bottom line, we account for the fact that the United States received net unilateral transfers from the rest of the world of -\157 billion (i.e., the United States makes net transfers to the rest of the world of \157 billion) on line 9. Adding these negative transfers to GNI results in a gross national disposable income GNDI of \15,771 billion on line 10.

Some Recent Trends Figures 16-5 and 16-6 show recent trends in various components of U.S. national income. Examining these breakdowns gives us a sense of the relative economic significance of each component.

In Figure 16-5, GNE is shown as the sum of consumption  $C$ , investment  $I$ , and government consumption  $G$ . Consumption accounts for about  $70\%$  of GNE, while government consumption  $G$  accounts for about  $15\%$ . Both of these components are relatively stable. Investment accounts for the rest of GNE (about  $15\%$ ), but investment tends to fluctuate more than  $C$  and  $G$  (e.g., it fell steeply after the Great Recession in 2008-2010). Over the period shown, GNE grew from  \$6,000 billion to around\$ 16,000 billion in current dollars.

Figure 16-6 shows the trade balance (TB), net factor income from abroad (NFIA), and net unilateral transfers (NUT), which constitute the current account (CA). In the United States, the trade balance is the dominant component in the current account. For the entire period shown, the trade balance has been in deficit and has grown larger over time. From 2004 to 2008, the trade balance was close to -\800 billion, but it fell during the recession as global trade declined and then rebounded somewhat.

# What the Current Account Tells Us

Because it tells us, in effect, whether a nation is spending more or less than its income, the current account plays a central role in economic debates. In particular, it is important to remember that Equation (16-4) can be concisely written as

$$
Y = C + I + G + C A \tag {16-5}
$$

This equation is the open-economy national income identity. It tells us that the current account represents the difference between national income  $Y$  (or GNDI) and gross national expenditure GNE (or  $C + I + G$ ). Hence,

GNDI is greater than GNE if and only if CA is positive, or in surplus.

GNDI is less than GNE if and only if CA is negative, or in deficit.

Subtracting  $C + G$  from both sides of the last identity, we can see that the current account is also the difference between national saving ( $S = Y - C - G$ ) and investment:

$$
\underbrace {S} _ {Y - C - G} = I + C A \tag {16-6}
$$ where national saving is defined as income minus consumption minus government consumption. This equation is called the current account identity even though it is just a rearrangement of the national income identity. Thus,


$S$  is greater than  $I$  if and only if  $CA$  is positive, or in surplus.

$S$  is less than  $I$  if and only if  $CA$  is negative, or in deficit.

These last two equations give us two ways of interpreting the current account, and tell us something important about a nation's economic condition. A current account deficit measures how much a country spends in excess of its income or—equivalently—how it saves too little relative to its investment needs. (A current account surplus means the opposite.) We can now understand the widespread use of the current account deficit in the media as a measure of how a country is "spending more than it earns" or "saving too little" or "living beyond its means."

# APPLICATION

# Global Imbalances

We can apply what we have learned to study some remarkable features of financial globalization in recent years, including the explosion in global imbalances: the widely discussed current account surpluses and deficits that have been of great concern to policy makers.

Figure 16-7 shows trends since 1970 in saving, investment, and the current account for four groups of industrial countries. All flows are expressed as ratios relative to each region's GDP. Some trends stand out. First, in all four cases, saving and investment have been on a marked downward trend for the past 30 years. From its peak, the ratio of saving to GDP fell by about 8 percentage points in the United States, about 15 percentage points in Japan, and about 6 percentage points in the Eurozone and other countries. Investment ratios typically followed a downward path in all regions, too. In Japan, this decline was steeper than the decline in savings, but in the United States, there was hardly any decline in investment.

These trends reflect the recent history of the industrialized countries. The U.S. economy grew rapidly after 1990 and the Japanese economy grew very slowly, with other countries in between. The fast-growing U.S. economy generated high investment demand, while in slumping Japan investment collapsed; other regions maintained middling levels of growth and investment. Decreased saving in all the countries reflects the demographic shift toward aging populations. That is, higher and higher percentages of these nations' populations are retired, are no longer earning income, and are living on funds they saved in the past.

The current account identity tells us that  $CA$  equals  $S$  minus  $I$ . Thus, investment and saving trends have a predictable impact on the current accounts of industrial countries. Because saving fell more than investment in the United States, the current account moved sharply into deficit, a trend that was only briefly slowed in the early 1990s. By 2003-05 the U.S. current account was at a record deficit level close to  $-6\%$  of U.S. GDP, only to fall later in the Great Recession. In Japan, saving fell less than investment, so the opposite happened: a very big current account surplus opened up in the 1980s and 1990s, which closed recently. In the euro area and other industrial regions, the difference between saving and investment has been fairly steady, so their current accounts have been closer to balance.

Saving, Investment, and Current Account Trends: Industrial Countries The charts show saving, investment, and the current account as a percent of each subregion's GDP for four groups of advanced countries. The United States has seen both saving and investment fall since 1980, but saving has fallen further than investment, opening up a large current account deficit approaching  $6\%$  of GDP in recent years. Japan's experience is the opposite: investment has fallen further than saving, opening up a large current account surplus of about  $3\%$  to  $5\%$  of GDP, which has narrowed somewhat since the 2008 crisis and recession. The Euro area has also seen saving and investment fall but has been closer to balance overall. Other advanced countries (e.g., non-European EU countries, Canada, Australia, etc.) have tended to run large current account deficits, which have recently moved toward balance.

To uncover the sources of the trends in total saving, Figure 16-8 examines two of its components, public and private saving. We define private saving as the part of after-tax private sector disposable income that is not devoted to private consumption  $C$ . After-tax private sector disposable income, in turn, is national income  $Y$  minus the net taxes  $T$  paid by households to the government. Hence, private saving  $S_{p}$  is

$$

S _ {p} = Y - T - C \tag {16-7}

$$

Private saving can be a positive number, but if the private sector consumption exceeds after-tax disposable income, then private saving is negative. (Here, the private sector includes households and private firms, which are ultimately owned by households.)

# Private and Public Saving Trends: Industrial

Countries The chart on the left shows private saving and the chart on the right public saving, both as a percent of GDP. Private saving has been declining in the industrial countries, especially in Japan (since the 1970s) and in the United States (since the 1980s). Private saving has been more stable in the Euro area and other countries. Public saving is clearly more volatile than private saving. Japan has been mostly in surplus and massively so in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The United States briefly ran a government surplus in the late 1990s but then returned to a deficit position. All advanced countries have moved sharply toward lower public saving (in fact, larger deficits) and higher private saving since the 2008 crisis and recession.


Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook, September 2005, and updates.

Similarly, we define government saving or public saving as the difference between tax revenue  $T$  received by the government and government purchases  $G$ . Hence, public saving  $S_{g}$  equals

$$

S _ {g} = T - G \tag {16-8}

$$

Government saving is positive when tax revenue exceeds government consumption  $(T > G)$  and the government runs a budget surplus. If the government runs a budget deficit, however, government consumption exceeds tax revenue  $(G > T)$ , and public saving is negative.

If we add these last two equations, we see that private saving plus government saving equals total national saving

$$

S = Y - C - G = \underbrace {(Y - T - C)} _ {\text {}} + \underbrace {(T - G)} _ {\text {}} = S _ {p} + S _ {g} \tag {16-9}

$$

Private saving Government saving

In this last equation, taxes cancel out and do not affect saving in the aggregate because they are a transfer from the private sector to the public sector.

One striking feature of the charts in Figure 16-8 is the smooth path of private saving compared with the volatile path of public saving. Public saving is government tax revenue minus spending, and it fluctuates greatly as economic conditions change. The most noticeable feature is the very large public surpluses run up in Japan in the boom of the 1980s and early 1990s which then disappeared during the long slump in the mid- to late 1990s and early 2000s. In other cases, surpluses in the 1970s soon gave way to deficits in the 1980s, and despite occasional improvements in the fiscal balance (as in the late 1990s), deficits have been the norm in the public sector. The United States witnessed a particularly sharp move from surplus to deficit after the year 2000. All regions saw private saving rise and public saving decline after the 2008 crisis and up to 2012.


Do government deficits cause current account deficits? Sometimes they go together: in the early 2000s, the U.S. government went into deficit when it was fighting two wars (Afghanistan and Iraq) and implemented tax cuts. At the same time there was a large increase in the current account deficit as seen in Figure 16-7. Sometimes, however, the "twin deficits" do not occur at the same time; they are not inextricably linked, as is sometimes believed. Why?

We can use the equation just given and the current account identity to write

$$

C A = S _ {p} + S _ {g} - I \tag {16-10}

$$

Now, suppose the government lowers your taxes by  \$100 this year and borrows to finance the resulting deficit but also says you will be taxed by an extra\$ 100 plus interest next year to pay off the debt. The theory of Ricardian equivalence asserts that you and other households will save the tax cut to pay next year's tax increase, so that any fall in public saving will be fully offset by a rise in private saving. In this situation, the current account—as seen in Equation (16-10)—would be unchanged. However, empirical studies do not support this theory: private saving does not fully offset government saving in practice.[8]

How large is the effect of a government deficit on the current account deficit? Research suggests that a change of  $1\%$  of GDP in the government deficit (or surplus) coincides with a  $0.2\%$  to  $0.4\%$  of GDP change in the current account deficit (or surplus), a result consistent with a partial Ricardian offset.

A second reason why the current account might move independently of saving (public or private) is that during the same period there may be a change in the level of investment in the last equation. A comparison of Figures 16-7 and 16-8 shows this effect at work. For example, we can see from Figure 16-7 that the large U.S. current account deficits of the early to mid-1990s were driven by an investment boom, even though total saving rose slightly, driven by an increase in public saving seen in Figure 16-8. Here there was no correlation between government deficit (falling) and current account deficit (rising). Shifts after the 2008 recession illustrate multiple factors at work: U.S. investment collapsed and private saving rose as recession fears increased. The combined effects of lower investment and higher private saving more than offset the decline in public saving and so overall the current account deficit started to decline.

Finally, Figure 16-9 shows global trends in saving, investment, and the current account for advanced countries, emerging and developing economies, and the world economy since 1980. Because the U.S. economy accounts for a large part of the world economy, in aggregate, the industrial countries have shifted into current account deficit over this period, a trend that has been offset by a shift toward current account surplus in the developing countries. The industrialized countries all followed a trend of declining investment and saving ratios, but the developing countries saw the opposite

Global Imbalances The charts show saving (blue), investment (red), and the current account (yellow) as a percent of GDP. In the 1990s, emerging markets moved into current account surplus and this financed the overall trend toward current account deficit of the industrial countries. For the world as a whole up to the 1990s, global investment and saving rates declined as a percent of GDP, falling from a high of near  $25\%$  to lows near  $20\%$ . This trend started to reverse in the 2000s as high-growth emerging markets became a larger share of the global economy.

site trend: rising investment and saving ratios. For the developing countries, however, the saving increase was larger than the investment increase, allowing a current account surplus to open up. Overall, the industrial country trend of lower saving and investment drove the world trend of lower saving and investment in the 1980s and 1990s. But since the 2000s, the rising share of high-saving emerging and developing countries in the world economy has caused the world trends to reverse. Saving and investment have been on the rise in recent years, but the effects have been felt very unevenly across the globe, leading to the imbalances we have studied.

# 3 The Balance of Payments

In the previous section, we saw that the current account summarizes the flow of all international market transactions in goods, services, and factor services plus non-market transfers. In this section, we look at what's left: international transactions in assets. These transactions are of great importance because they tell us how the current account is financed and, hence, whether a country is becoming more or less indebted to the rest of the world. We begin by looking at how transactions in assets are accounted for, once again building on the intuition developed in Figure 16-2.

# Accounting for Asset Transactions: The Financial Account

The financial account (FA) records transactions between residents and nonresidents that involve financial assets. The total value of financial assets that are received by the rest of the world from the home country is the home country's export of assets, denoted  $EX_{A}$  (the subscript "A" stands for asset). The total value of financial assets that are received by the home country from the rest of the world in all transactions is the home country's import of assets, denoted  $IM_{A}$ .

The financial account measures all "movement" of financial assets across the international border. By this, we mean a movement from home to foreign ownership, or vice versa, even if the assets do not physically move. This definition also covers all types of assets: real assets such as land or structures, and financial assets such as debt (bonds, loans) or equity. The financial account also includes assets issued by any entity (firms, governments, households) in any country (home or overseas). Finally, the financial account includes market transactions as well as transfers, or gifts of assets.

Subtracting asset imports from asset exports yields the home country's net overall balance on asset transactions, which is known as the financial account, where  $FA = EX_{A} - IM_{A}$ . A negative FA means that the country has imported more assets than it has exported; a positive FA means the country has exported more assets than it has imported. The financial account therefore measures how the country can increase or decrease its holdings of assets through international transactions.

# Accounting for Asset Transactions: The Capital Account

The capital account (KA) covers some remaining, minor activities in the balance of payments account. One is the acquisition and disposal of nonfinancial, nonproduced assets (e.g., patents, copyrights, trademarks, franchises, etc.). These assets have to be included here because such nonfinancial assets do not appear in the financial account, although like financial assets, they can be bought and sold with resulting payments flows. The other important item in the capital account is capital transfers (i.e., gifts of assets), an example of which is the forgiveness of debts.[10]

As with unilateral income transfers, capital transfers must be accounted for properly. For example, the giver of an asset must deduct the value of the gift in the capital account to offset the export of the asset, which is recorded in the financial account, because in the case of a gift the export generates no associated payment. Similarly, recipients of capital transfers need to record them to offset the import of the asset recorded in the financial account.

Using similar notation to that employed with unilateral transfers of income, we denote capital transfers received by the home country as  $KA_{IN}$  and capital transfers given by the home country as  $KA_{OUT}$ . The capital account,  $KA = KA_{IN} - KA_{OUT}$ , denotes net capital transfers received. A negative KA indicates that more capital transfers were given by the home country than it received; a positive KA indicates that the home country received more capital transfers than it made.

The capital account is a minor and technical accounting item for most developed countries, usually close to zero. In some developing countries, however, the capital account can at times play an important role because in some years nonmarket debt forgiveness can be large, whereas market-based international financial transactions can be small.

# Accounting for Home and Foreign Assets

Asset trades in the financial account can be broken down into two types: assets issued by home entities (home assets) and assets issued by foreign entities (foreign assets). This is of economic interest, and sometimes of political interest, because the breakdown makes clear the distinction between the location of the asset issuer and the location of the asset owner, that is, who owes what to whom.

From the home perspective, a foreign asset is a claim on a foreign country. When a home entity holds such an asset, it is called an external asset of the home country because it represents an obligation owed to the home country by the rest of the world. Conversely, from the home country's perspective, a home asset is a claim on the home country. When a foreign entity holds such an asset, it is called an external liability of the home country because it represents an obligation owed by the home country to the rest of the world. For example, when a U.S. firm invests overseas and acquires a computer factory located in Ireland, the acquisition is an external asset for the United States (and an external liability for Ireland). When a Japanese firm acquires an automobile plant in the United States, the acquisition is an external liability for the United States (and an external asset for Japan). A moment's thought reveals that all other assets traded across borders have a nation in which they are located and a nation by which they are owned—this is true for bank accounts, equities, government debt, corporate bonds, and so on. (For some examples, see Side Bar: The Double-Entry Principle in the Balance of Payments.)

If we use superscripts "H" and "F" to denote home and foreign assets, we can break down the financial account as the sum of the net exports of each type of asset:

$$

F A = \underbrace {\left(E X _ {A} ^ {H} - I M _ {A} ^ {H}\right)} _ {\text {N e t e x p o r t o f}} + \underbrace {\left(E X _ {A} ^ {F} - I M _ {A} ^ {F}\right)} _ {\text {N e t e x p o r t o f}} = \underbrace {\left(E X _ {A} ^ {H} - I M _ {A} ^ {H}\right)} _ {\text {N e t e x p o r t o f}} - \underbrace {\left(I M _ {A} ^ {F} - E X _ {A} ^ {F}\right)} _ {\text {N e t i m p o r t o f}} \tag {16-11}

$$

In the last part of this formula, we use the fact that net imports of foreign assets are just minus net exports of foreign assets, allowing us to change the sign. This reveals to us that FA equals the additions to external liabilities (the home-owned assets moving into foreign ownership, net) minus the additions to external assets (the foreign-owned assets moving into home ownership, net). This is our first indication of how flows of assets have implications for changes in a nation's wealth, a topic to which we return shortly.

# How the Balance of Payments Accounts Work:

# A Macroeconomic View

To further understand the links between flows of goods, services, income, and assets, we have to understand how the current account, capital account, and financial account are related and why, in the end, the balance of payments accounts must balance as seen in the open-economy circular flow (Figure 16-2).

Recall from Equation (16-4) that gross national disposable income is

$$

Y = G N D I = G N E + T B + N F I A + N U T = \underbrace {G N E + C A} _ {\text {R e s o u r c e s a v a i l a b l e t o}}

$$

Does this expression represent all of the resources that are available to the home economy to finance expenditure? No. It represents only the income resources, that is, the resources obtained from the market sale and purchase of goods, services, and factor services and from nonmarket transfers. In addition, the home economy can free up (or use up) resources in another way: by engaging in net sales (or purchases) of assets. We can calculate these extra resources using our previous definitions:

$$

\underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} E X _ {A} - K A _ {O U T} \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {V a l u e o f}} - \underbrace {\left[ I M _ {A} - K A _ {I N} \right]} _ {\text {a l l a s s e t s}} = E X _ {A} - I M _ {A} + K A _ {I N} - K A _ {O U T} = \underbrace {F A + K A} _ {\text {E x t r a r e s o u r c e s}}

$$

Adding the last two expressions, we arrive at the value of the total resources available to the home country for expenditure purposes. This total value must equal the total value of home expenditure on final goods and services, GNE:

$$

\underbrace {G N E + C A} _ {\text {R e s o u r c e s a v a i l a b l e}} + \underbrace {F A + K A} _ {\text {E x t r a r e s o u r c e s a v a i l a b l e}} = G N E

$$

We can cancel GNE from both sides of this expression to obtain the important result known as the balance of payments identity or BOP identity:

$$

\underbrace {C A} _ {\text {C u r r e n t a c c o u n t}} + \underbrace {K A} _ {\text {C a p i t a l a c c o u n t}} + \underbrace {F A} _ {\text {F i n a c i a l a c c o u n t}} = 0 \tag {16-12}

$$

The balance of payments sums to zero: it does balance!

# How the Balance of Payments Accounts Work:

# A Microeconomic View

We have just found that at the macroeconomic level,  $CA + KA + EA = 0$ , a very simple equation that summarizes, in three variables, every single one of the millions of international transactions a nation engages in. This is one way to look at the BOP accounts.

Another way to look at the BOP is to look behind these three variables to the specific flows we saw in Figure 16-2, and the individual transactions within each flow.

$$

C A = (E X - I M) + \left(E X _ {F S} - I M _ {F S}\right) + \left(U T _ {I N} - U T _ {O U T}\right)

$$

$$

K A = \left(K A _ {I N} - K A _ {O U T}\right) \tag {16-13}

$$

$$

F A = \left(E X _ {A} ^ {H} - I M _ {A} ^ {H}\right) + \left(E X _ {A} ^ {F} - I M _ {A} ^ {F}\right)

$$

Written this way, the components of the BOP identity allow us to see the details behind why the accounts must balance. As you can observe from these equations, there are 12 transaction types (each preceded by either a plus or minus sign) and 3 accounts (CA, KA, FA) in which they can appear.

If an item has a plus sign, it is called a balance of payments credit, or BOP credit. Six types of transactions receive a plus (+) sign as follows:

Current account (CA):

Exports of goods and services  $(+EX)$

Exports of factor services  $(+EX_{FS})$

Unilateral transfers received  $(+UT_{IN})$

Capital account (KA):

Capital transfers received  $(+KA_{IN})$

Financial account (FA):

Exports of home and foreign assets

$$

\left(+ E X _ {A} ^ {H}, + E X _ {A} ^ {F}\right).

$$

If an item has a minus sign, it is called a balance of payments debit, or BOP debit. Six types of transactions receive a minus  $(-)$  sign as follows:

Current account (CA):

Imports of goods and services  $(-IM)$

Imports of factor services  $(-IM_{FS})$

Unilateral transfers given  $(-UT_{OUT})$

Capital account (KA):

Capital transfers given  $(-KA_{OUT})$

Financial account (FA):

Imports of home and foreign assets

$$

\left(- I M _ {A} ^ {H}, - I M _ {A} ^ {F}\right).

$$

Now, to see why the BOP accounts balance overall, we have to understand one simple principle: every market transaction (whether for goods, services, factor services, or assets) has two parts. If party  $A$  engages in a transaction with a counterparty  $B$ , then  $A$  receives from  $B$  an item of a given value, and in return  $B$  receives from  $A$  an item of equal value.[11]

Thus, whenever a transaction generates a credit somewhere in the BOP account, it must also generate a corresponding debit somewhere else in the BOP account. Similarly, every debit generates a corresponding credit. (For more detail on this topic, see Side Bar: The Double-Entry Principle in the Balance of Payments.)

It might not be obvious where the offsetting item is, but it must exist somewhere if the accounts have been measured properly. As we shall see shortly, this is a big "if": mismeasurement can sometimes be an important issue.

# SIDE BAR

# The Double-Entry Principle in the Balance of Payments

We can make the double-entry principle more concrete by looking at some (mostly) hypothetical international transactions and figuring out how they would be recorded in the U.S. BOP accounts.

1. Recall from Chapter 13 that our friend George was in Paris. Suppose he spent \$110 (€100) on French wine one evening. This is a U.S. import of a foreign service. George pays with his American Express card. The bar is owed \$110 (or €100) by American Express (and Amex is owed by George). The United States has exported an asset to France: the bar now has a claim against American Express. From the U.S. perspective, this represents an increase in U.S. assets owned by foreigners. The double entries in the U.S. BOP appear in the current account and the financial account:

CA: Drinks in Paris bar -IM -110

FA: Bar's claim on AMEX +EX_{A}^{H} +\110

2. George was in the bar to meet his Danish cousin Georg. They both work as wine merchants. After a few bottles of Bordeaux, George enthuses about Arkansas chardonnay and insists Georg give it a try. Georg counters by telling George he should really try some Jutland rosé. Each cousin returns home and asks his firm to ship a case of each wine (worth 36) to the other. This barter transaction (involving no financial activity) would appear solely as two entries in the U.S. current account:

CA: Arkansas wine exported EX +36 to Denmark

CA: Jutland wine imported -IM -\36 to United States

3. Later that night, George met a French entrepreneur in a smoky corner of the bar. George vaguely remembers the story: the entrepreneur's French tech company was poised for unbelievable success with an upcoming share issue. George decides to invest 10,000 to buy the French stock; he imports a French asset. The stock is sold to him through the French bank BNP, and George sends them a U.S. check. BNP then has a claim against Citibank, an export of a home asset to France. Both entries fall within the financial account:


FA: George's French tech  $-IM_A^F$  -10,000 stocks

FA: BNP claim against +EX_{A}^{H} +\10,000 Citibank

4. Rather surprisingly, George's French stocks do quite well. Later that year they have doubled in value. George makes a 5,000 donation to charity. His charity purchases U.S. relief supplies that will be exported to a country suffering a natural disaster. The two entries here are entirely in the U.S. current account. The supplies are a nonmarket export of goods offset by the value of the unilateral transfer:

CA: Relief supplies exported  $EX + \$  5,000$

CA: George's charitable gift -UTOUT -5,000

5. George was also pleased to see that some poor countries were benefiting from another kind of foreign assistance, debt forgiveness. The U.S. Secretary of State announced that the United States would forgive 1 billion of debt owed by a developing country. This would decrease U.S.-owned assets overseas. The United States was exporting the developing country's assets: it hands the canceled debts back, a credit in the financial account. The double entries would be seen in the capital and financial accounts:

KA: U.S. grant of debt relief -KA_{OUT} -1,000,000,000

FA: Decline in U.S. external  $-EX_A^F$  +1,000,000,000 assets

# Understanding the Data for the Balance of Payments Account

To illustrate all the principles we've learned, let's look at the United States' balance of payments account. Table 16-2 shows an extract of the U.S. BOP accounts for 2012.[12]

In the current account, in the top part of the table, we look first at the trade in goods and services on lines 1 and 3. Overall exports  $EX$  were  $+\ 2,{194}$  billion (line 1,a credit), and imports  ${IM}$  were  $- \$  2,{734}  billion (line 3,a debit). In the summary items,

Data preliminary as of March 14, 2013.</td></tr></table> we see the balance on goods and services, the trade balance TB, was -\ 540 billion (line 1 plus line 3, or exports minus imports). Exports and imports and the trade balance are also broken down even further into goods and service components (lines 1a, 1b, 3a, and 3b).


The next part of the current account on lines 2 and 4 deals with trade in factor services, also known as the income account (referring to the income paid to those factors). Income receipts for factor service exports,  EX_{FS} , generated a credit of  +\742  billion and income payments for factor service imports,  IM_{FS} , generated a debit of  -\543  billion. Adding these two items resulted in net factor income from abroad NFIA equal to  +\199  billion (line 2 plus line 4), a net credit.

Lastly, we see that net unilateral transfers NUT were -\ 134 billion, a net debit (line 5); the United States was a net donor as measured by the net transfer of goods, services, and income to the rest of the world. (Typically, in summary tables like these, unilateral transfers are shown only in net form.)

Overall, summing lines 1 through 5, the 2012 U.S. current account balance CA was  $-475$  billion, that is, a deficit of  $475$  billion, as shown in the summary items at the foot of the table.

A country with a current account surplus is called a (net) lender. By the BOP identity, we know that it must have a deficit in its asset accounts, so like any lender, it is, on net, buying assets (acquiring IOUs from borrowers). For example, China is a large net lender. A country with a current account deficit is called a (net) borrower. By the BOP identity, we know that it must have a surplus in its asset accounts, so like any borrower, it is, on net, selling assets (issuing IOUs to lenders). As we can see, the United States is a large net borrower.

Now we move to the capital and financial accounts. Typically, in summary tables like these, the capital account is shown only in net form. The United States in 2012 had a negligible capital account KA of +\ 6 billion (line 6).

Lastly, we move to the financial account. As explained, this account can be broken down in terms of the exports and imports of two kinds of assets: U.S. assets (U.S. external liabilities) and rest of the world assets (U.S. external assets). In this summary the net trades are shown for each kind of asset.

We see that the United States was engaged in the net sale of foreign assets, so that external assets (U.S.-owned assets abroad) decreased by  \$18 billion. This net export of foreign assets is recorded as a credit of +\$ 18 billion (line 7). Note that the plus sign maintains the convention that exports are credits.

At the same time, the United States was engaged in the net export of U.S. assets to the rest of the world so that external liabilities (foreign-owned assets in the United States) increased by  \$385 billion; the net export of U.S. assets is duly recorded as a credit of +\$ 385 billion (line 8).

The sum of lines 7 and 8 gives the financial account balance FA of +\ 403 billion, recorded in the summary items.

For further information on interventions by central banks, financial account transactions are often also broken down into reserve and nonreserve components. Changes in reserves arise from official intervention in the foreign exchange market—that is, purchases and sales by home and foreign monetary authorities. The balance on all reserve transactions is called the official settlements balance, and the balance on all other asset trades is called the nonreserve financial account. We see here that U.S. authorities intervened a little: a net import of 4 billion of U.S. official reserves (line 7a) means that the Federal Reserve bought  \$4 billion in foreign (i.e., nondollar) exchange reserves from foreigners. In contrast, foreign central banks intervened a lot: U.S. entities sold them\$ 374 billion in U.S. dollar reserve assets (line 8a).


Adding up the current account, the capital account, and the financial account (lines 1 through 8), we find that the total of the three accounts was -\66 billion (-475 + \6 + \$403 = -\$66). The BOP accounts are supposed to balance by adding to zero—in reality, they never do. Why not? Because the statistical agencies tasked with gathering BOP data find it impossible to track every single international transaction correctly, because of measurement errors and omissions. Some problems result from the smuggling of goods or trade tax evasion. Larger errors are likely due to the mismeasured, concealed, or illicit movement of financial income flows and asset movements (e.g., money laundering and capital tax evasion).

The Statistical Discrepancy To "account" for this error, statistical agencies create an accounting item, the statistical discrepancy (SD) equal to minus the error  $SD = -(CA + KA + FA)$ . With that "correction," the amended version of the BOP identity will hold true in practice, sweeping away the real-world measurement problems. In the table, the statistical discrepancy is shown on line 9. $^{13}$  Once the statistical discrepancy is included, the balance of payments accounts always balance.

Some Recent Trends in the U.S. Balance of Payments Figure 16-10 shows recent trends in various components of the U.S. balance of payments. The sharp downward trend of the current account is as previously shown in Figure 16-6, so for the balance of payments identity to hold, there must be an offsetting upward trend in other parts of the BOP accounts. This is indeed the case. We can see that the United States has been financing its growing deficit on the current account primarily by running an expanding surplus on the financial account. In the mid-1990s, there was close to a  \$100 billion current account deficit and a comparable financial account surplus. A decade later, both figures were in the region of\$ 800 billion, with a substantial decline seen in the period since the global financial crisis of 2008 and up to 2012.

# What the Balance of Payments Account Tells Us

The balance of payments accounts consist of the following:

- The current account, which measures external imbalances in goods, services, factor services, and unilateral transfers.
The financial and capital accounts, which measure asset trades.

Using the principle that market transactions must consist of a trade of two items of equal value, we find that the balance of payments accounts really do balance.

Surpluses on the current account side of the BOP accounts must be offset by deficits on the asset side. Similarly, deficits on the current account must be offset by surpluses on the asset side. By telling us how current account imbalances are financed, the balance of payments connects a country's income and spending decisions to the evolution of that country's wealth, an important connection we develop further in the final section of this chapter.

# 4 External Wealth

The measurement of a nation's income flow is not the only important economic variable that must be adapted to the open-economy environment. Economists and policy makers, and the general public, also care about a nation's stock of wealth. And so, probably, do you.

For example, Anne has income and expenditures of  \$50,000 each year and savings in the bank of\$ 10,000. But she also has a credit card debt of \$20,000. Beth's life is identical to Anne's in almost every respect: she has income and expenditures of \$50,000 each year and savings of \$10,000, but she has no credit card debt. Who is better off? Clearly, Beth is. Her income is the same as Anne's. But Anne's wealth or "net worth" is -\$10,000 (savings of \$10,000 minus debt of \$20,000), whereas Beth has a net worth of +10,000. Anne's wealth is -20\% of her income; Beth's wealth is +20\% of her income.

Just as a household is better off with higher wealth, all else equal, so is a country. We can calculate a home country's "net worth" or external wealth (W) with respect to the rest of the world (ROW) by adding up all of the home assets owned by ROW

(foreigners' claims against home) and then subtracting all of the ROW assets owned by the home country (home claims against foreigners). Doing this for the United States at the end of year 2012, we would find that the United States had an external wealth of about  $-4,474 billion, according to preliminary BEA estimates. This made the United States the world's biggest debtor in history at the time of this writing. The United States' net debt to the ROW was about\$ 14,250 for every American. Because GDP per person in the United States was about \$50,000 in 2012, the external wealth of the U.S. was about  $-28.5\%$  of GDP.

Why is U.S. external wealth at this level? How did it get there and what will happen next? To understand how the wealth levels of countries evolve, in this final section of the chapter we build on what we have learned from the national income and balance of payments accounts.

# The Level of External Wealth

First, we give a definition of the level of a country's external wealth  $(W)$ :

$$

\underbrace {\text {E x t e r n a l w e a l t h}} _ {W} = \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{l} \text {R O W a s s e t s} \\ \text {o w n e d b y h o m e} \end{array} \right]} _ {A} - \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{l} \text {H o m e a s s e t s} \\ \text {o w n e d b y R O W} \end{array} \right]} _ {L} \tag {16-14}

$$

External wealth equals the value of total external assets  $(A)$  minus the value of total external liabilities  $(L)$ . Total external assets is what the rest of the world owes to the home country, and total external liabilities is what the home country owes to the ROW. A country's level of external wealth is also called its net international investment position or net foreign assets. It is a stock measure, not a flow measure.

If  $W > 0$ , the home country is a net creditor country: external assets exceed external liabilities, and what the rest of the world owes the home country is greater than what the home country owes to the rest of the world.

If  $W < 0$ , the home country is a net debtor country: external liabilities exceed external assets, and what the home country owes to the rest of the world is greater than what the rest of the world owes to the home country.

External wealth is only one part of a nation's total wealth. The other part of a nation's wealth is internal wealth, which corresponds to the total value of all nonfinancial assets in the home country. (The links between external wealth and total wealth are explored further in the appendix to this chapter.)

Because we are focusing on international economic relationships, our main emphasis is on external wealth because it measures the outstanding obligations of one country to another. Those obligations, and when and how they are paid, can be the source of great economic and political stress. Moreover, the net debts of nations, like those of individuals, ultimately carry a cost. To understand external wealth, let's look at how it is measured and how it evolves.

# Changes in External Wealth

There are two reasons a country's level of external wealth changes over time.

1. Financial flows: As a result of asset trades, the country can increase or decrease its external assets and liabilities. How? Net exports of foreign assets cause an equal decrease in the level of external assets and hence a corresponding decrease in external wealth. Net exports of home assets cause an equal increase in the level of external liabilities and hence a corresponding decrease in external wealth. For example, if net exports of assets (whether home or foreign) are  $+$ 1 billion, then the change in external wealth is  $-$ 1 billion. The net export of assets of all kinds is measured by the financial account (FA), and this has a negative effect on external wealth in any period.


2. Valuation effects: The value of existing external assets and liabilities may change over time because of capital gains or losses. In the case of external wealth, this change in value could be due to price effects or exchange rate effects. For example, suppose, a U.S. citizen buys 100 shares of BP on the London Stock Exchange at £7 each. Suppose the exchange rate is \$1.5 per pound. These U.S. external assets are worth \$10.50 each (1.5 times 7), for a total of \$1,050. Suppose the price of these shares then falls to £6, and the exchange rate stays the same. Each share is now worth \$9.00 (1.5 times 6) and the 100 shares are valued at \$900. Their value has fallen in dollar terms by \$150 (£1 times 1.5 times 100), which is a capital loss. This is an example of a price effect. Now suppose the exchange rate rises to \$1.6 per pound. Each share is still worth £6 in U.K. currency but \$9.60 in U.S. currency (1.6 times 6), so the total value of the shares rises to \$960, which, relative to the \$900 they were previously worth, implies a capital gain of 60. This is an example of an exchange rate effect. Similar effects can change the value of external liabilities.

Adding up these two contributions to the change in external wealth  $(\Delta W)$ , we find

$$

\underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C h a n g e i n} \\ \text {e x t e r n a l w e a l t h} \end{array} \right]} _ {\Delta W} = - \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {F i n a n c i a l} \\ \text {a c c o u n t} \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {N e t e x p o r t o f a s s e t s}} + \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s o n} \\ \text {e x t e r n a l w e a l t h} \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {E A}} \tag {16-15}

$$

We gain a deeper understanding of this expression if we recall the BOP identity: the current account plus the capital account plus the financial account equals zero. Hence, minus the financial account equals the current account plus the capital account, or  $-FA = CA + KA$ . Substituting this identity into Equation (16-15), we obtain

$$

\underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C h a n g e i n} \\ \text {e x t e r n a l w e a l t h} \end{array} \right]} _ {\Delta W} = \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C u r r e n t} \\ \text {a c c o u n t} \end{array} \right]} _ {CA} + \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l} \\ \text {a c c o u n t} \end{array} \right]} _ {K A} + \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s o n} \\ \text {e x t e r n a l w e a l t h} \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {V a l u a t i o n e f f e c t s}} \tag {16-16}

$$

This fundamental formula tells us that a country can increase its external wealth in one of only three ways:

Through its own thrift (a CA surplus, so expenditure is less than income)
By the charity of others (a KA surplus, by receiving net gifts of wealth)
With the help of windfalls (having positive capital gains)

Similarly, a country can reduce its external wealth by doing any of the opposites.

# Understanding the Data on External Wealth

To track external wealth accurately, statisticians apply Equation (16-15). They face the challenge of not only keeping tabs on every trade in assets but also correctly assessing the impact of changing financial market conditions around the world on the value of the country's external assets and liabilities.

Measures of levels and changes in national external wealth are tabulated in an account known as the net international investment position. To illustrate with an example, a simplified version of this account for the United States appears in Table 16-3. The latest detailed data for the year 2012 show a clear distinction between the contribution of financial flows to changes in external wealth—net trade in assets, in column (a)—and the impact of various kinds of valuation effects—columns (b), (c), and (d).

Table 16-3, line 3, column (a), shows that in 2012 the United States, on net, exported  \$446 billion in assets (net exports of\$ 544 billion of U.S. assets on line 3, minus

On their own, these financial flows would have reduced U.S. external wealth by\$ 446 billion in just one year. Yet the actual change in external wealth was much smaller in that year due to positive valuation effects of +341 billion in columns (b), (c), and (d) which mitigated the decline U.S. external wealth over the same period. These valuation effects were mainly driven by +490 billion in price change effects and only +5 billion in exchange rate effects. "Other" changes are recorded as -153 billion. Thus, while the United States borrowed an additional \$446 billion from various nations in 2012, its external wealth actually fell by only \$105 billion as shown by the total change on line 3.


So what happened in 2012? The value of the U.S. dollar changed very little against foreign currencies, and hence exchange rate effects were tiny. The main factor was that equity values were rising worldwide (about  $15\%$ ). However, U.S. external assets include a larger share of higher-risk equities than U.S. external liabilities, which consist of a great deal of lower-risk U.S. debt. This difference in the composition of the two portfolios meant that rising equity markets tended to raise the value of U.S. external assets (which went up about  $6\%$  in value) much more than U.S. external liabilities (which went up about  $2.5\%$ ). In addition, U.S. external liabilities include vast foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, held either as foreign official assets in central banks or as low-risk assets by foreign investors. These dollar-denominated assets tended to have a stable value in 2012 as interest rates on U.S. debt remained low and changed very little from the start to the end of the year.[14]

Some Recent Trends Over the longer run, the changes in external wealth in Equation (16-16) gradually accumulate. In the case of the United States, for the past three decades, the financial account has been almost always in surplus, reflecting a net export of assets to the rest of the world to pay for chronic current account deficits (the capital account has been negligibly small).

If there had been no valuation effects, then Equation (16-15) would make a simple prediction. The change in the level of external wealth between two dates should equal the cumulative net import of assets (minus the financial account) over the intervening period. For example, if we had taken the U.S. external wealth level at the end of 1988 and added to that level all subsequent financial flows for the next 24 years until the end of 2012, we would have estimated U.S. external wealth in 2012 at about  $-8,000$  billion, which would have been a massive net debtor position (exceeding  $-50\%$  of GDP). In reality, the actual 2011 figure for external wealth was a lot smaller: only  $-4$  trillion ( $-3,922$  billion as shown in Table 16-3).

Why? Valuation effects or capital gains generated the difference of 4 trillion in external wealth over the period from 1988 to 2012, and when added up these effects reduced U.S. net external indebtedness in 2012 by almost one-half compared with the level that financial flows alone would have predicted. The flip side of these valuation effects is that the rest of the world outside the United States suffered an equal and opposite capital loss over the same period. Why? Capital gains always have a "zero sum" property—by symmetry, an increase in the dollar value of the home country's external assets is simultaneously an increase in the dollar value of the rest of the world's external liabilities.

# What External Wealth Tells Us

External wealth data tell us the net credit or debit position of a country with respect to the rest of the world. They include data on external assets (foreign assets owned by the home country) and external liabilities (home assets owned by foreigners). A creditor country has positive external wealth, a debtor country negative external wealth.

What drives external wealth? The current account told us about the imbalances in a country's external flows of goods, services, factor services, and income. The balance of payments accounts told us how these imbalances require offsetting financial flows of assets between countries. Countries with a current account surplus (deficit) must be net buyers (sellers) of assets. This buying and selling of assets has implications for external wealth. An increase in a country's external wealth results from every net import of assets; conversely, a decrease in external wealth results from every net export of assets. In addition, countries can experience capital gains or losses on their external assets and liabilities that cause changes in external wealth. All of these changes are summarized in the statement of a country's net international investment position.

# 5 Conclusions

The science of macroeconomics would be impossible without data, and the vast majority of the data we employ emerge from the efforts of official statisticians around the world. Despite all the statistical discrepancies, and even the occasional errors of omission and commission (see Side Bar: Beware of Greeks Bearing Statistics), we would be lost without these measures of macroeconomic activity.

This chapter has illustrated some important accounting concepts and has highlighted some unusual and intriguing features of the current international economic system. We have seen how a consistent system of national income and product accounts allows countries to track international trade flows (including trade in intermediate goods), cross-border factor income flows, and unilateral transfers. We have also seen how these net resource flows of goods and services can be matched against a parallel set of net payment activities involving assets in the balance of payments accounts. Finally, we have seen how the flow of trades in assets can be combined with capital gains and losses to track the evolution of a nation's stock of external wealth, an important part of its total wealth, as recorded in the statement of the net international investment position.

In the remainder of the book, we make extensive use of the concepts introduced in this chapter to develop theories that explore the global macroeconomic links between nations.

# SIDE BAR

# Beware of Greeks Bearing Statistics

It is important, but rather sad, to note that when it comes to national statistics, we cannot believe everything we read. Over the years numerous governments have been suspected of fiddling with their official data for various purposes, as indicated by the following examples:

- Greece. In 2001 Greece was allowed to join the Eurozone. One of the criteria it had to meet in order to join was that its budget deficit could not be more than  $3\%$  of its GDP. Greece met this requirement according to its official statistics. In November 2004, after it had been allowed to join the Eurozone, Greece admitted its 2003 budget deficit was really  $3.4\%$ , twice as large as it had previously claimed. In fact, the budget deficit had not been below  $3\%$  since 1999. The EU was not amused. Greece continued to publish incorrect or manipulated data (including a  $25\%$  upward adjustment to GDP to take into account "black economy" activity such as prostitution). By inflating its GDP, Greece made its budget deficit position look better than it was, which may have allowed Greece to borrow from other countries on favorable terms. When the euro crisis hit in 2008-09, the full horror of Greece's weak economic and fiscal position became clear, by which point the fiasco forced other Eurozone nations and the IMF to provide emergency funding in 2010. Greece eventually defaulted in 2011, went into a deeper depression, and the economic and political ramifications (e.g., austerity policies, the collapse of the Cyprus banking system in 2013, and undermined confidence in other weak economies) have continued to threaten the survival of the euro project itself.
- Italy. In 1987 Italy was considered much poorer than northern European countries. But its statisticians also decided to increase GDP by  $15\%$  after some guesswork to account for the black economy. Instantly, Italians had a higher official GDP per person than the British, an event known as il sorpasso. Not that this made any Italians actually feel richer.
- Argentina. After its 2001 crisis, a new populist government took over but faced problems with high and persistent inflation. To "solve" this problem, the government "reorganized" its official statistical bureau, which then started publishing much lower, and highly suspicious, inflation data. Lower inflation also helped the government avoid larger costs of indexed benefits and allowed the government to claim it had solved the inflation problem. Few believed these published data were true.
- China. In the 2005 International Comparison Program by the World Bank, the estimate of China's yuan price level came in much higher than had been expected. This had various implications: dividing nominal yuan income by the price level made China look quite a bit poorer. And higher prices made China's real exchange rate less undervalued, or even overvalued. Since poorer countries usually have lower price levels, both of these impacts had the effect of making China's exchange rate look more fairly valued, given its standard of living. This came about at a time when China was under considerable political pressure to appreciate its currency. But skeptics doubted whether the data were totally plausible, because the change in the yuan price level since the previous ICP was much larger than that implied by China's own official inflation data over the same period.

# KEY POINTS

1. National flows of expenditure, product, income, and wealth, and international flows of goods, services, income, and assets, together measure important aspects of a country's economic performance and describe its economy's relationship to economies in the rest of the world. The records kept in the national income and product accounts, the balance of payments account, and the net international investment position track these data.

2. The key measures of economic activity are:

- Gross national expenditure (GNE) measures an economy's total spending on final goods and services. It is the sum of consumption, investment, and government consumption:  $GNE = C + I + G$ .
- Gross domestic product (GDP) measures total production (value of all output minus value of all purchased inputs).
- Gross national income (GNI) measures the total payments to an economy's domestic factors.
- Gross national disposable income (GNDI, also denoted  $Y$ ) measures an economy's disposable income including transfers.

In a closed economy,  $GNE = GDP = GNI = GNDI$ .

3. In an open economy, GDP need not equal GNE. When nations can trade, the sum of goods and services demanded by domestic residents need not be the same as the sum of goods and services supplied by domestic firms. The difference between GDP and GNE is the trade balance TB:  $GDP = GNE + TB$ . The trade balance is the difference between a nation's imports and exports of goods and services.
4. In an open economy, GDP need not equal GNI because imports and exports of factor services

(measured by net factor income from abroad or NFIA) imply that factor income received by domestic residents need not be the same as factor payments made by domestic firms. Thus,  $GNI = GDP + NFLA$ .

5. In an open economy, the true level of disposable income is best measured by gross national disposable income or  $Y = GNDI$ . GNDI need not equal GNI because net unilateral transfers (NUT) to foreigners may be positive, due to foreign aid and other nonmarket gifts. Thus,  $Y = GNDI = GNI + NUT$ .
6. The sum of all the aforementioned international transactions,  $TB + NFIA + NUT$ , is called the current account (CA).
7. From the relationships just outlined, we find that  $Y = C + I + G + CA$ . This expression is known as the national income identity.
8. National saving  $S$  is defined as  $Y - C - G$ . From the national income identity, we can derive the current account identity:  $S = I + CA$ . The current account equals saving minus investment. Movements in saving or investment, all else equal, feed directly into the current account.
9. All international trades in goods and services and in assets are recorded in an account known as the balance of payments (BOP). As a result of double-entry bookkeeping, and allowing for gifts and transfers, the BOP must sum to zero.

10. The BOP contains the following:

- Net exports of goods and services, TB, called the trade balance
- Net exports of factor services, NFIA, called the net factor income from abroad
- Net unilateral transfers received, NUT, called the net unilateral transfers
- Net transfers of assets received, KA, called the capital account
- Net exports of assets, FA, called the financial account

11. The first three items are the current account CA. Since the BOP accounts sum to zero, this implies the balance of payments identity:  $CA + FA + KA = 0$ .
12. External wealth is a measure of a country's credit or debt position versus the rest of the world. It equals external assets—rest of world (ROW) assets owned by home—minus external liabilities (home assets owned by ROW). The net export (import) of assets lowers (raises) a country's external wealth. External wealth is one part of a country's total wealth.
13. External wealth can change for one of two reasons: the export or import of assets (called financial flows) or changes in the value of existing assets due to capital gains or losses (called valuation effects). Both of these channels affect net external wealth.

Using this expression, show that in a closed economy, gross domestic product (GDP), gross national income (GNI), and gross national expenditures (GNE) are the same. Show that domestic investment is equal to domestic savings.

3. Show how each of the following would affect the U.S. balance of payments. Include a description of the debit and credit items, and in each case identify which specific account is affected (e.g., imports of goods and services,  $IM$ ; exports of assets,  $EX_{A}$ ; and so on. (For this question, you may find it helpful to refer to Appendix 1.) a. A California computer manufacturer purchases a 50 hard disk from a Malaysian company, paying the funds from a bank account in Malaysia.

b. A U.S. tourist to Japan sells his iPod to a local resident for yen worth 100.
c. The U.S. central bank sells 500 million of its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds to a British financial firm and purchases pound sterling foreign reserves.
d. A foreign owner of Apple shares receives 10,000 in dividend payments, which are paid into a New York bank.
e. The central bank of China purchases \$1 million of export earnings from a firm that has sold \$1 million of toys to the United States, and the central bank holds these dollars as reserves.
f. The U.S. government forgives a 50 million debt owed by a developing country.

4. In 2010 the country of Ikonomia has a current account deficit of \$1 billion and a non-reserve financial account surplus of \$750 million. Ikonomia's capital account is in a \$100 million surplus. In addition, Ikonomian factories located in foreign countries earn \$700 million. Ikonomia has a trade deficit of \$800 million. Assume Ikonomia neither gives nor receives unilateral transfers. Ikonomia's GDP is \$9 billion.

a. What happened to Ikonomia's net foreign assets during 2010? Did it acquire or lose foreign assets during the year?

b. Compute the official settlements balance (OSB). Based on this number, what happened to the central bank's (foreign) reserves?
c. How much income did foreign factors of production earn in Ikonomia during 2010?
d. Compute net factor income from abroad (NFIA).
e. Using the identity  $BOP = CA + FA + KA$ , show that  $BOP = 0$ .
f. Compute Ikonomia's gross national expenditure (GNE), gross national income (GNI), and gross national disposable income (GNDI).

5. To answer this question, you must obtain data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), http://www.bea.gov, on the U.S. balance of payments (BOP) tables. Go to interactive tables to obtain annual data for 2008 (the default setting is for quarterly data). It may take you some time to become familiar with how to navigate the website. You need only refer to Table 1 on the BOP accounts. Using the BOP data, compute the following for the United States: a. Trade balance (TB), net factor income from abroad (NFIA), net unilateral transfers (NUT), and current account (CA)

b. Financial account (FA) c. Official settlements balance (OSB), referred to as "U.S. official reserve assets" and "Foreign official assets in the U.S."
d. Nonreserve financial account (NRFA) e. Balance of payments (BOP). Note that this may not equal zero because of statistical discrepancy. Verify that the discrepancy is the same as the one reported by the BEA.

6. Continuing from the previous question, find nominal GDP for the United States in 2008 (you can find it elsewhere on the BEA site). Use this information along with your previous calculations to compute the following: a. Gross national expenditure (GNE), gross national income (GNI), and gross national disposable income (GNDI)

b. In macroeconomics, we often assume the U.S. economy is a closed economy when building models that describe how changes in policy and shocks affect the economy. Based on the previous data (BOP and GDP), do you think this is a reasonable assumption to make? Do international transactions account for a large share of total transactions (involving goods and services, or income) involving the United States?


7. During the 1980s, the United States experienced "twin deficits" in the current account and government budget. Since 1998 the U.S. current account deficit has grown steadily along with rising government budget deficits. Do government budget deficits lead to current account deficits? Identify other possible sources of the current account deficits. Do current account deficits necessarily indicate problems in the economy?
8. Consider the economy of Opulenza. In Opulenza, domestic investment of  \$400 million earned\$ 20 million in capital gains during 2012. Opulenzans purchased \$120 million in new foreign assets during the year; foreigners purchased \$160 million in Opulenzan assets. Assume the valuation effects total 1 million in capital gains.

a. Compute the change in domestic wealth in Opulenza.
b. Compute the change in external wealth for Opulenza.
c. Compute the total change in wealth for Opulenza.
d. Compute domestic savings for Opulenza.
e. Compute Opulenza's current account. Is the CA in deficit or surplus?
f. Explain the intuition for the CA deficit/ surplus in terms of savings in Opulenza, financial flows, and its domestic/external wealth position.
g. How would a depreciation in Opulenza's currency affect its domestic, external, and total wealth? Assume that foreign assets owned by Opulenzans are denominated in foreign currency.

Visit the BEA's balance of payments data page and obtain the U.S. balance of payments for 2004 in billions of dollars. Be sure to get the correct year, and annual data, not quarterly.

Visit the BEA's net international investment position data page and obtain the U.S. net international investment position for end 2003 to end 2004.

a. What was the U.S. current account for 2004?
b. What was the U.S. financial account for 2004?
c. What was the U.S. change in external wealth for 2004?
d. What was the U.S. total valuation effect for 2004?
e. Does the answer to part (d) equal the answer to part (e) minus the answer to part (c)? Why?

f. What do the BEA data indicate was the U.S. valuation effect due to exchange rate changes for 2004?

You may now assume that the U.S. dollar depreciated by  $10\%$  against major currencies in 2004, and use this average to estimate valuation effects.

g. What were end-2003 U.S. external liabilities? If  $5\%$  of these liabilities were in foreign currency and were subject to a  $10\%$  exchange rate appreciation, what decrease in U.S. external wealth resulted?
h. What were end-2003 U.S. external assets? If  $65\%$  of these assets were subject to a  $10\%$  exchange rate appreciation, what increase in U.S. external wealth resulted?
i. Using the answers to parts (g) and (h), what was the 2004 U.S. valuation effect due to exchange rate changes according to your rough calculation? Is it close to the BEA figure in part (f)?

# APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 16

# External Wealth and Total Wealth

In this chapter, we studied external wealth, but individuals and countries care about their total wealth. How does external wealth relate to total wealth?

External wealth is only part of a country's total wealth, the sum of the home capital stock (all nonfinancial assets in the home economy, denoted  $K$ ) plus amounts owed to home by foreigners ( $A$ ) minus amounts owed foreigners by home ( $L$ ):

$$

\text {T o t a l w e a l t h} = \underbrace {K} _ {\substack {\text {H o m e n o n f i n a n c i a l} \\ \text {a s s e t s}}} + \underbrace {(A - L)} _ {\substack {\text {E x t e r n a l w e a l t h}}}

$$

In this definition, note that we deliberately exclude financial assets owed by one home entity to another home entity because in the aggregate these cancel out and form no part of a country's total wealth.

Changes in the value of total wealth can then be written as follows:

$$

\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C h a n g e i n} \\ \text {t o t a l w e a l t h} \end{array} \right] = \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {A d d i t i o n s} \\ \text {t o} K \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {A d d i t i o n s (a c q u i s i t i o n s m i n u s d i s p o s a l s)}} + \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {A d d i t i o n s} \\ \text {t o} A - L \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {C a p i t a l g a i n s}} + \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s} \\ \text {o n} K \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {V a l u a t i o n e f f e c t s (g a i n s m i n u s l o s s e s)}}

$$

There are two kinds of terms in this expression. The total value of wealth (of a person or a country) may change due to additions of assets (such as purchases, sales, or net gifts) or due to valuation effects (capital gains—or, if they are negative, capital losses—arising from changes in the prices of assets).

The previous equation can be simplified by two observations. First, additions to the domestic capital stock  $K$  have a simpler expression: they are known as investment, denoted  $I$ . (Strictly, this is the gross addition to the capital stock; the net addition would require the subtraction of depreciation, and in the previous notation that would be accounted for under valuation effects since depreciating assets fall in value.)

Second, additions to external wealth,  $A - L$ , also have a simpler expression: they are equal to net additions to external assets minus net additions to external liabilities, and as we saw in the main chapter, these are equal to minus the financial account,  $-FA$ .

Substituting, we can rewrite the last equations as

$$

\left[ \begin{array}{l} \text {C h a n g e i n} \\ \text {t o t a l w e a l t h} \end{array} \right] = \underbrace {I} _ {\substack {\text {A d d i t i o n s t o} K \\ = \\ \text {A d d i t i o n s t o} \\ \text {a s s e t s i n t h e} \\ \text {h o m e e c o n o m y}}} + \underbrace {(- F A)} _ {\substack {\text {A d d i t i o n s t o} A - L \\ = \\ \text {N e t i m p o r t o f} \\ \text {a s s e t s i n t o t h e} \\ \text {h o m e e c o n o m y}}} + \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s} \\ \text {o n} K \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s} \\ \text {o n} A - L \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {V a l u a t i o n e f f e c t s (g a i n s m i n u s l o s s e s)}}

$$

Now, using the BOP identity, we know that  $CA + KA + FA = 0$  so that minus the financial account  $-FA$  must equal  $CA + KA$ ; hence, we can rewrite the last equation as

$$

\left[ \begin{array}{l} \text {C h a n g e i n} \\ \text {t o t a l w e a l t h} \end{array} \right] = I + C A + K A + \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s} \\ \text {o n} K \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s} \\ \text {o n} A - L \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {V a l u a t i o n e f f e c t s (g a i n s m i n u s l o s s e s)}}

$$

Notice what has happened here. The BOP identity makes the connection between external asset trade and activity in the current account. We take the connection one step further using the current account identity,  $S = I + CA$ , which allows us to write

$$

\left[ \begin{array}{l} \text {C h a n g e i n} \\ \text {t o t a l w e a l t h} \end{array} \right] = S + K A + \underbrace {\left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s} \\ \text {o n} K \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s} \\ \text {o n} A - L \end{array} \right]} _ {\text {V a l u a t i o n e f f e c t s (g a i n s m i n u s l o s s e s)}}

$$

The message of this expression is clear. As we all probably know from personal experience, there are only three ways to get more (or less) wealthy: do more (or less) saving  $(S)$ , receive (or give) gifts of assets  $(KA)$ , or enjoy the good (bad) fortune of capital gains (losses) on your portfolio. What is true about individuals' wealth is also true for the wealth of a nation in the aggregate.
