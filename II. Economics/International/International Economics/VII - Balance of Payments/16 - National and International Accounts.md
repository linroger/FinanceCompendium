# Balance of Payments I: The Gains from Financial Globalization

Save for a rainy day.

Make bay while the sun shines.

Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

# H ow does your household cope with economic shocks and the financial

challenges they pose? Let's take an extreme example. Suppose you are self-employed and own a business. A severe storm appears and a flood overwhelms your town. This is bad news on several fronts. As people recover from the disaster, businesses, including yours, suffer and your income is lower for several months. If your business premises are damaged, you must also plan to make new investments to repair the damage.

If you have no financial dealings with anyone, your household, as a little closed economy, faces a difficult trade-off as your income falls. Your household income has to equal its consumption plus investment. Would you try to maintain your level of consumption, and neglect the need to invest? Or would you invest, and let your household suffer as you cut back drastically on consumption? Faced with an emergency like this, most of us look for help beyond our own household, if we can: we might hope for transfers (gifts from friends and family, or emergency relief payments from the government or a charity), or we might rely on financial markets (dip into savings, apply for a loan, rely on an insurance payout, etc.).

What does this story have to do with international economics? If we redraw the boundaries of this experiment and expand from the household unit, to the local, regional, and finally national level, the same logic applies. Countries face shocks all the time, and how they are able cope with them depends on whether they are open or closed to economic interactions with other nations.

3 Gains from Efficient Investment

4 Gains from Diversification of Risk

5 Conclusions

To get a sense of how countries can deal with shocks, we can look at data from Caribbean and Central American countries that have faced the same kinds of shock as the household we just described. Every year many tropical storms, some of them of hurricane strength, sweep through this region. The storms are large—hundreds of miles across—and most countries in the region are much smaller in size, some no more than little islets. For them, a hurricane is the town flood blown up to a national scale. The worst storms cause widespread destruction and loss of life.

Hurricanes are tragic human events, but they provide an opportunity for research. Economists study them because such an "act of God"—in economics jargon, a "natural experiment"—provides a laboratory-like test of economic theory. Figure 17-1 shows the average macroeconomic response in these countries after they were hit by a hurricane. In the aftermath, these countries do some of the things we would expect households to do: accept nonmarket gifts (transfers from foreign countries) and borrow (by running a current account deficit). If we subtract nonmarket transfers and examine market behavior alone, the patterns are striking. As a fraction of GDP, investment is typically  $3\%$  to  $6\%$  higher than normal in the three years after a hurricane, and saving is  $1\%$  to  $5\%$  lower (excluding transfers). Combining the two effects, the current account (saving minus investment) falls dramatically and is  $6\%$  to  $10\%$  more in deficit than normal.

Hurricanes are extreme examples of economic shocks. They are not representative of the normal fluctuations that countries experience, but the size and randomness of the hurricanes allow us to look at the nations' macroeconomic responses to such a shock. These responses illustrate some of the financial mechanisms that help open economies cope with all types of shocks, large and small, natural or human in origin.

In this chapter, we see how financially open economies can, in theory, reap gains from financial globalization. We first look at the factors that limit international borrowing and lending. Then, in the remaining sections of the chapter, we see how a nation's ability to use international financial markets allows it to accomplish three different goals:

The responses are as expected: investment rises (to rebuild) and saving falls (to limit the fall in consumption); hence, the current account moves sharply toward deficit.

Note: Transfers are excluded from saving and the current account, and the saving measure is calculated as  $S - \text{NUT} = I + CA - \text{NUT}$ .

■ consumption smoothing (steadying consumption when income fluctuates);

■ efficient investment (borrowing to build a productive capital stock); and

■ diversification of risk (by trading of stocks between countries).

Along the way, we look at how well the theoretical gains from financial globalization translate into reality (an area of some dispute among economists) and find that many of these gains have yet to be realized. In advanced countries, the gains from financial globalization are often large and more attainable, but in poorer countries the gains may be smaller and harder to realize. We want to understand why these differences exist, and what risks may arise for poor countries that attempt to capture the gains from financial globalization.

# 1 The Limits on How Much a Country Can Borrow: The Long-Run Budget Constraint

Our introductory examples show how borrowing can help countries (like households) better cope with shocks. But, also like households, there is a limit to how much a country can borrow (or, how much lenders will lend). Understanding the constraints on how countries might borrow and lend to each other is our critical first task in this chapter. With this understanding we can then examine how financial globalization shapes the economic choices available to a country as economic conditions change over time. The ability to borrow in times of need and lend in times of prosperity has profound effects on a country's well-being.

When we study an economy as it evolves over time, we are taking a dynamic approach to macroeconomics—rather than a static approach by looking at the state of the economy at one specific time. The dynamic approach is also known as the intertemporal approach to macroeconomics. One key to this approach is that we must keep track of how a country is managing its wealth and whether it is doing so in a way that is within its means, that is, sustainable in the long run. The intertemporal approach makes use of the key lessons from the end of the last chapter, which taught us how to account for the change in a nation's external wealth from one period to the next.

In this section, we use changes in an open economy's external wealth to derive the key constraint that limits its borrowing in the long run: the long-run budget constraint (LRBC). The LRBC tells us precisely how and why a country must, in the long run, "live within its means." A country's ability to adjust its external wealth through borrowing and lending provides a buffer against economic shocks, but the LRBC places limits on the use of this buffer.

To develop some intuition, let's look at a simple household analogy. This year (year 0) you borrow  $100,000 from the bank at an interest rate of 10\%$  annually. You have no other wealth and inflation is zero. Once you borrow the 100,000, consider two possible different ways in which you can deal with your debt each year.

Case 1 A debt that is serviced. Every year you pay the  $10\%$  interest due on the principal amount of the loan, 10,000, but you never pay any principal. At the

Hurricane Mitch battered Central America from October 22, 1998, to November 5, 1998. It was the deadliest hurricane in more than 200 years and the second deadliest ever recorded.

end of each year, the bank renews the loan (a rollover), and your wealth remains constant at  $-\$ 100,000$ .

Case 2 A debt that is not serviced. You pay neither interest nor principal but ask the bank to roll over the principal plus the interest due on it each year. In year 1, the overdue interest is  $10,000, and your debt grows by 10\%$  to 110,000. In year 2, the overdue interest is  $10\%$  of $110,000, or $11,000, and your debt grows by  $10\%$  again to $121,000. Assuming this process goes on and on, your level of debt grows by  $10\%$  every year.

Case 2 is not sustainable. If the bank allows it, your debt level will explode to infinity as it grows by  $10\%$  every year forever. This case, sometimes called a rollover scheme, a pyramid scheme, or a Ponzi game, illustrates the limits or constraints on the use of borrowing, which implies negative external wealth. In the long run, lenders will simply not allow the debt to grow beyond a certain point. Debts must be paid off eventually. This requirement is the essence of the long-run budget constraint.

# How the Long-Run Budget Constraint Is Determined

As is usual when building an economic model, we start with a basic model that makes a number of simplifying assumptions, but yields lessons that can be extended to more complex cases. Here are the assumptions we make about various conditions that affect our model:

- Prices are perfectly flexible. Under this assumption, all analysis in this chapter can be conducted in terms of real variables, and all monetary aspects of the economy can be ignored. (To adjust for inflation and convert to real terms, we could divide all nominal quantities by an index of prices.)
The country is a small open economy. The country trades goods and services with the rest of the world through exports and imports and can lend or borrow overseas, but only by issuing or buying debt (bonds). Because it is small, the country cannot influence prices in world markets for goods and services.
- All debt carries a real interest rate  $r^*$ , the world real interest rate, which we assume to be constant. Because the country is small, it takes the world real interest rate as given, and we assume it can lend or borrow an unlimited amount at this interest rate.
- The country pays a real interest rate  $r^{*}$  on its start-of-period debt liabilities  $L$  and is paid the same interest rate  $r^{*}$  on its start-of-period debt assets  $A$ . In any period, the country earns net interest income payments equal to  $r^{*}A$  minus  $r^{*}L$  or, more simply,  $r^{*}W$ , where  $W$  is external wealth  $(A - L)$  at the start of the period. External wealth may vary over time.
- There are no unilateral transfers  $(NUT = 0)$ , no capital transfers  $(KA = 0)$ , and no capital gains on external wealth. Under these assumptions, there are only two nonzero items in the current account: the trade balance TB and net factor income from abroad,  $r^{*}W$ . If  $r^{*}W$  is positive, the country is earning interest and is a lender/creditor with positive external wealth. If  $r^{*}W$  is negative, the country is paying interest and is a borrower/debtor with negative external wealth.

Calculating the Change in Wealth Each Period In the previous balance of payments chapter, we saw that the change in external wealth equals the sum of three terms: the current account, the capital account, and capital gains on external wealth. In the special case we are studying, our assumptions tell us that the last two terms are zero, and that the current account equals the sum of just two terms: the trade balance  $TB$  plus any net interest payments  $r^{*}W$  at the world interest rate on the external wealth held at the end of the last period.

Mathematically, we can write the change in external wealth from end of year  $N - 1$  to end of year  $N$  as follows (where subscripts denote periods, here years):

$$
\Delta W _ {N} = \underbrace {W _ {N} - W _ {N - 1}} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n e x t e r n a l}} = \underbrace {T B _ {N}} _ {\text {T r a d e b a n c e}} + \underbrace {r ^ {*} W _ {N - 1}} _ {\text {I n t e r s t p a i d / r e c e i v e d o n}}
$$

In this simplified world, external wealth can change for only two reasons: surpluses or deficits on the trade balance in the current period, or surpluses and deficits on net factor income arising from interest received or paid.

Calculating Future Wealth Levels Now that we have a formula for wealth changes, and assuming we know the initial level of wealth in year  $N - 1$ , we can compute the level of wealth at any time in the future by repeated application of the formula.

To find wealth at the end of year  $N$ , we rearrange the preceding equation:

$$
\underbrace {W _ {N}} _ {\substack {\text {External wealth at} \\ \text {the end of this period}}} = \underbrace {T B _ {N}} _ {\substack {\text {Trade balance} \\ \text {this period}}} + \underbrace {(1 + r ^ {*}) W _ {N - 1}} _ {\substack {\text {Last period's external wealth} \\ \text {plus interest paid/received}}}
$$

This equation presents an important and intuitive result: it shows that wealth at the end of a period is the sum of two terms. The trade balance this period captures the addition to wealth from net exports (exports minus imports). Wealth at the end of last period times  $(1 + r^{*})$  captures the wealth from last period plus the interest earned on that wealth. The examples in the following sections will help us understand the changes in a country's external wealth and the role that the trade balance plays here.

# The Budget Constraint in a Two-Period Example

We first put these ideas to work in a simplified two-period example. Suppose we start in year 0, so  $N = 0$ . Suppose further that a country has some initial external wealth from year  $-1$  (an inheritance from the past), and can borrow or lend in the present period (year 0). We also impose the following limit: by the end of year 1, the country must pay off what it has borrowed from other countries and must call in all loans it has made to other countries. That is, the country must end year 1 with zero external wealth.

As we saw in the formula given earlier,  $W_0 = (1 + r^*)W_{-1} + TB_0$ . Wealth at the end of year 0 depends on two things. At the end of year 0, the country carries over from the last period (year -1) its initial wealth level, plus any interest accumulated on it. In addition, if the country runs a trade deficit it has to run its external wealth down by adding liabilities (borrowing) or cashing in external assets (dissaving); conversely, if the country runs a trade surplus, it lends that amount to the rest of the world.

That's the end of year 0. But next, where do things stand at the end of year 1? We assume the country must have zero external wealth when the world ends at the end of year 1. Applying the preceding formula to year 1, we know that  $W_{1} = 0 = (1 + r^{*})W_{0} + TB_{1}$ . We can then substitute  $W_{0} = (1 + r^{*})W_{-1} + TB_{0}$  into this formula to find that

$$
W _ {1} = 0 = \left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {2} W _ {- 1} + \left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) T B _ {0} + T B _ {1}
$$

This equation shows that two years later at the end of year 1 the country has accumulated wealth equal to the trade balance in years 0 and 1  $(TB_0 + TB_1)$ ; plus one year of interest earned (or paid) on the year 0 trade balance  $(r^{*}TB_{0})$ ; plus the two years of interest and principal earned (or paid) on its initial wealth  $(1 + r^{*})^{2}W_{-1}$ .

Because we have stated that the final wealth level  $W_{1}$  must be zero, the right-hand side of the last equation must be zero, too. For that to be the case, the trade balances in year 0 ( $TB_{0}$ ) and in year 1 ( $TB_{1}$ ) (plus any accumulated interest) must be equal and opposite to initial wealth ( $W_{-1}$ ) (plus any accumulated interest):

$$
- \left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {2} W _ {- 1} = \left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) T B _ {0} + T B _ {1}
$$

This equation is the two-period budget constraint. It tells us that a creditor country with positive initial wealth (left-hand-side negative) can afford to run trade deficits "on average" in future; conversely, a debtor country (left-hand-side positive) is required to run trade surpluses "on average" in future.

Present Value Form By dividing the previous equation by  $(1 + r^{*})$ , we find a more intuitive expression for the two-period budget constraint:

$$
\underbrace {- (1 + r ^ {*}) W _ {- 1}} _ {\text {M i n u s t h e p r e s e n t v a l u e}} = \underbrace {T B _ {0} + \frac {T B _ {1}}{(1 + r ^ {*})}} _ {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f a l l p r e s e n t}}
$$

Every element in this statement of the two-period budget constraint represents a quantity expressed in so-called present value terms.

By definition, the present value of X in period N is the amount that would have to be set aside now, so that, with accumulated interest, X is available N periods from now. If the interest rate is r*, then the present value of X is X/(1 + r*)^N. For example, if you are told that you will receive $121 at the end of year 2 and the interest rate is 10\%, then the present value of that $121 now, in year 0, is $100 because $100 × 1.1 (adding interest earned in year 1) × 1.1 (adding interest earned in year 2) = 121.

A Two-Period Example Let's put some numbers into the last equation. Suppose a country starts in debt, with a wealth level of  $-\$ 100$  million at the end of year  $-1$ :  $W_{-1} = -\$ 100$  million. Question: at a real interest rate of  $10\%$ , how can the country satisfy the two-period budget constraint that it must have zero external wealth at the end of year 1? Answer: to pay off the \$110 million (initial debt plus the interest accruing on this debt during period 0) on the left-hand side, the country must ensure that the present value of future trade balances  $TB_{1}$  is  $+\$ 110$  million on the right-hand side. The country has many ways to do this.

- It could pay off its debt at the end of period 0 by running a trade surplus of 110 million in period 0 and then have balanced trade in period 1.
It could wait to pay off the debt until the end of period 1 by having balanced trade in period 0 and then running a trade surplus of 121 million in period 1.
- It could pay off the debt and its accumulated interest through any other combination of trade balances in periods 0 and 1, as long as external wealth at the end of period 1 is zero and the budget constraint is satisfied.

Extending the Theory to the Long Run By extending the two-period model to  $N$  periods, and allowing  $N$  to run to infinity, we can transform the two-period budget constraint into the long-run budget constraint (LRBC). Repeating the two-period logic  $N$  times, external wealth after  $N$  periods is initial wealth and accumulated interest on that wealth (whether positive or negative) plus all intervening trade balances and accumulated interest on those positive or negative trade balances. If external wealth is to be zero at the end of  $N$  periods, then the sum of the present values of  $N$  present and future trade balances must equal minus the present value of external wealth. If  $N$  runs to infinity, we get an infinite sum and arrive at the equation of the LRBC: $^2$

$$
\underset {\text {M i n u s t h e p r e s e n t v a l u e o f}} {\text {L R B C :}} \underbrace {- (1 + r ^ {*}) W _ {- 1}} = \underbrace {T B _ {0} + \frac {T B _ {1}}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right)} + \frac {T B _ {2}}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {2}} + \frac {T B _ {3}}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {3}} + \frac {T B _ {4}}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {4}} + \cdots} _ {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f a l l p r e s e n t a n d f u t u r e t r a d e b a l a n c e s}} \tag {17-1}
$$

This expression for the LRBC says that a debtor country must have future trade balances that are positive in present value terms so that they offset the country's initially negative wealth. Conversely, a creditor country must have future trade balances that are negative in present value terms so that they offset the country's initially positive wealth. The LRBC plays an important role in our analysis of how countries can lend or borrow because it imposes a condition that rules out choices that would lead to exploding positive or negative external wealth.

# A Long-Run Example: The Perpetual Loan

The following example helps us understand the long-run budget constraint and we can apply it to various cases that we visit in the rest of the chapter. It shows us how countries that take out an initial loan must make payments to service that loan in the future.

Suppose that today is year 0 and a country is to pay (e.g., to its creditors) a constant amount  $X$  every year starting next year, year 1. What is the present value  $(PV)$  of that sequence of payments  $(X)$ ?

$$
P V (X) = \frac {X}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right)} + \frac {X}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {2}} + \frac {X}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {3}} + \dots
$$

This expression for  $PV(X)$  is an infinite sum. If we multiply this equation by  $(1 + r^{*})$ , we obtain

$$
P V (X) (1 + r ^ {*}) = X + \frac {X}{(1 + r ^ {*})} + \frac {X}{(1 + r ^ {*}) ^ {2}} + \frac {X}{(1 + r ^ {*}) ^ {3}} + \dots
$$

To get this result, we can take the basic equation for the change in external wealth,  $W_{0} = (1 + r^{*})W_{-1} + TB_{0}$  and apply it  $N$  times with repeated substitution to obtain wealth at the end of period  $N$ :

$$
W _ {N} = \left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {N + 1} W _ {- 1} + \left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {N} T B _ {0} + \left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {N - 1} T B _ {1} + \left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {N - 2} T B _ {2} + \dots + \left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) T B _ {N - 1} + T B _ {N}
$$

We can then get toward the LRBC in the text if we divide the previous equation by  $(1 + r^{*})^{N}$

$$
\frac {W _ {N}}{(1 + r ^ {*}) ^ {N}} = (1 + r ^ {*}) W _ {- 1} + T B _ {0} + \frac {T B _ {1}}{(1 + r ^ {*})} + \frac {T B _ {2}}{(1 + r ^ {*}) ^ {2}} + \dots + \frac {T B _ {N}}{(1 + r ^ {*}) ^ {N}}.
$$

As we saw earlier, in a Ponzi game, external wealth  $W_{N}$  explodes, growing by a factor  $(1 + r^{*})$  every period. To prevent this, external wealth  $W_{N}$  (whether positive or negative) must grow more slowly in the long run than the factor  $(1 + r^{*})^{\mathrm{N}}$ . In this case, as  $N$  approaches infinity, the left-hand side of the above equation will approach zero. When this is the case, the right-hand side must also approach zero. This tendency of the right-hand side to go to zero in the limit leads directly to the LRBC equation (17-1) in the text.

To find a simple expression for  $PV(X)$ , we subtract the first equation from the second, cancel out all of the terms on the right except  $X$ , then rearrange the remaining equation  $r^{*}PV(X) = X$  to arrive at:

$$
\underbrace {\frac {X}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right)} + \frac {X}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {2}} + \frac {X}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {3}} + \cdots} _ {P V (X)} = \frac {X}{r ^ {*}} \tag {17-2}
$$

This formula helps us compute  $PV(X)$  for any stream of constant payments, something we often need to do to verify the long-run budget constraint.

For example, if the constant payment is  $X = 100$  and the interest rate is  $5\%$  ( $r^{*} = 0.05$ ), Equation (17-2) says that the present value of a stream of payments of 100 starting in year 1 is  $100 / 0.05 = 2,000$ :

$$
\frac {1 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 0 5)} + \frac {1 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 0 5) ^ {2}} + \frac {1 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 0 5) ^ {3}} + \dots = \frac {1 0 0}{0 . 0 5} = 2, 0 0 0
$$

This example, which we will often revisit later in this chapter, shows the stream of interest payments on a perpetual loan (i.e., an interest-only loan or, equivalently, a sequence of loans for which only the principal is refinanced or rolled over every year). If the amount loaned by the creditor is  $2,000 in year 0, and this principal amount is outstanding forever, then the interest that must be paid each year to service the debt is 5\%$  of 2,000, or 100. Under these conditions, wherein the loan payments are always fully serviced, the present value of the future interest payments equals the value of the amount loaned in year 0 and the LRBC is satisfied.

# Implications of the LRBC for Gross National Expenditure and Gross Domestic Product

In economics, a budget constraint always tells us something about the limits to expenditure, whether for a person, firm, or government. The LRBC is no different—it tells us that in the long run, a country's national expenditure (GNE) is limited by how much it produces (GDP).

To see why this is true, recall from the previous chapter that the trade balance is the difference between gross domestic product and gross national expenditure,  $TB = GDP - GNE$ . If we insert this expression into the LRBC equation (17-1) and collect terms, we see that

$$
\underbrace {(1 + r ^ {*}) W _ {- 1}} _ {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f}} + \underbrace {G D P _ {0} + \frac {G D P _ {1}}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right)} + \frac {G D P _ {2}}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {2}} + \cdots} \tag {17-3}
$$

Present value of wealth from last period Present value of present and future GDP

Present value of the country's resources

$$
= \underbrace {G N E _ {0} + \frac {G N E _ {1}}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right)} + \frac {G N E _ {2}}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {2}} + \cdots}
$$

Present value of present and future GNE

Present value of the country's spending

The left side of this equation is the present value of the country's resources in the long run: the present value of any inherited wealth plus the present value of present and future product as measured by GDP. The right side is the present value of all present and future spending  $(C + I + G)$  as measured by GNE.

We have arrived at the following, very important result: the long-run budget constraint says that in the long run, in present value terms, a country's expenditures (GNE) must equal its production (GDP) plus any initial wealth. The LRBC states that an economy must live within its means in the long run.

# Summary

The key lesson of our intertemporal model is that a closed economy is subject to a tighter budget constraint than an open economy. In a closed economy, "living within your means" requires a country to have balanced trade each and every year. In an open economy, "living within your means" requires only that a country must maintain a balance between its trade deficits and surpluses that satisfies the long-run budget constraint—they must balance only in a present value sense, rather than year by year.

This conclusion implies that an open economy should be able to do better (or no worse) than a closed economy in achieving its desired pattern of expenditure over time. This is the essence of the theoretical argument that there are gains from financial globalization.

In the next section, we examine this argument in greater detail and consider under what circumstances it is valid in the real world. First, however, we consider some situations in which the assumptions of the model might need to be modified.

# APPLICATION

# The Favorable Situation of the United States

Two assumptions greatly simplified our intertemporal model. We assumed that the same real rate of interest  $r^*$  applied to income received on assets and income paid on liabilities, and we assumed that there were no capital gains on external wealth. However, these assumptions do not hold true for the United States.

"Exorbitant Privilege" Since the 1980s, the United States has been the world's largest ever net debtor with  $W = A - L < 0$ . Under the model's simplifying assumptions, negative external wealth would lead to a deficit on net factor income from abroad with  $r^{*}W = r^{*}(A - L) < 0$ . And yet as we saw in the last chapter, U.S. net factor income from abroad has been positive throughout this period! How can this be?

The only way a net debtor can earn positive net interest income is by receiving a higher rate of interest on its assets than it pays on its liabilities. The data show that this has been consistently true for the United States since the 1960s. The interest the United States has received on its assets has been higher by about 1.5 to 2 percentage points per year on average (with a slight downward trend) than the interest it pays on its liabilities.

To develop a framework to make sense of this finding, suppose the United States receives interest at the world real interest rate  $r^*$  on its external assets but pays interest at a lower rate  $r^0$  on its liabilities. Then its net factor income from abroad is  $r^* A - r^0 L = r^* W + (r^* - r^0)L$ . The final term, the interest rate difference times total liabilities, is an income bonus the United States earns as a "banker to the world"—like any other bank, it borrows low and lends high.

Understandably, the rest of the world may resent this state of affairs from time to time. In the 1960s French officials complained about the United States' "exorbitant privilege" of being able to borrow cheaply by issuing external liabilities in the form of reserve assets (Treasury debt) while earning higher returns on U.S. external assets such as foreign equity and foreign direct investment. This conclusion is not borne out in the data, however. U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data suggest that most of the interest rate difference is due not to the low interest paid on Treasury debt, but to the low interest rate on U.S. equity liabilities (i.e., low profits earned on foreign investment in the United States).

"Manna from Heaven" The difference between interest earned and interest paid isn't the only deviation from our simple model that benefits the United States. BEA statistics reveal that the country has long enjoyed positive capital gains (KG) on its external wealth. This gain, which started in the 1980s, comes from a difference of two percentage points between large capital gains on several types of external assets and smaller capital losses on external liabilities.

It is hard to pin down the source of these capital gains because the BEA data suggest that these effects are not the result of price or exchange rate effects, and they just reflect capital gains that cannot be otherwise measured. As a result, the accuracy and meaning of these measurements is controversial. Some skeptics call these capital gains "statistical manna from heaven." Others think these gains are real and may reflect the United States acting as a kind of "venture capitalist to the world." As with the "exorbitant privilege," this financial gain for the United States is a loss for the rest of the world.

Summary When we add the  $2\%$  capital gain differential to the  $1.5\%$  interest differential, we end up with a U.S. total return differential (interest plus capital gains) of about  $3.5\%$  per year on average since the 1980s. For comparison, in the same period, the total return differential was close to zero in every other G7 country.

To include the effects of the total return differential in our model, we have to incorporate the effect of the extra "bonuses" on external wealth as well as the conventional terms that reflect the trade balance and interest payments:

$$
\Delta W _ {N} = \underbrace {W _ {N} - W _ {N - 1}} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n}} = \underbrace {\underbrace {T B _ {N}} _ {\text {T r a d e}}} _ {\text {b a l a n c e}} + \underbrace {r ^ {*} W _ {N - 1}} _ {\text {I n t e r e s t p a i d / r e c e i v e d}} + \underbrace {(r ^ {*} - r ^ {0}) L} _ {\text {o n l a s t p e r i o d /}} + \underbrace {K G} _ {\text {I n c o m e d u t o}}
$$

Too Good to Be True? With this equation, the implications of the final two terms become clearer for the U.S. economy. When positive, they offset wealth losses due to trade deficits. Thus, if these terms increase in value by  $1\%$  of GDP, for example, then the United States could run an additional  $1\%$  of GDP in trade deficit forever and still satisfy its LRBC.

As Figure 17-2 shows, the United States has seen these offsets increase markedly in recent years, rising from  $1\%$  of GDP in the late 1980s to an average of about  $4\%$ of GDP in the 2000s. These large offsets have led some economists to take a relaxed view of the swollen U.S. trade deficit because the offsets finance a large chunk of the country's trade deficit—with luck, in perpetuity. However, we may not be able to count on these offsets forever: longer-run evidence suggests that they are not stable and may be diminishing over time.

Others warn that, given the likely presence of errors in these data, we really have no idea what is going on. In 2006, economist Daniel Gros calculated that the United States had borrowed  $5,500 billion over 20 years, even though its external wealth had fallen by "only"$ 2,800 billion. Have 2.7 trillion dollars been mislaid? Gros argued

# How Favorable Interest Rates and Capital Gains on External Wealth Help the United

States The total average annual change in U.S. external wealth each period is shown by the dark red columns. Negative changes were offset in part by two positive effects. One effect was due to the favorable interest rate differentials on U.S. assets (high) versus liabilities (low). The other effect was due to favorable rates of capital gains on U.S. assets (high) versus liabilities (low). Without these two offsetting effects, the declines in U.S. external wealth would have been much bigger.

Notes: Interest rate differential effects are computed assuming that counterfactual liability yields would have been equal to asset yields. Capital gains are computed as the difference between financial flows and changes in external wealth.

that most of this difference can be attributed to poor U.S. measurement of the assets foreigners own and investment earnings foreigners receive. Correcting these errors would make all of the additional offset terms disappear—and roughly double the estimated current level of U.S. net indebtedness to the rest of the world.[7]

# APPLICATION

# The Difficult Situation of the Emerging Markets

The previous application showed that the simple intertemporal model may not work for the United States. In this section, we see that its assumptions may also not work for emerging markets and developing countries.

As in the U.S. example, the first assumption we might question is that these nations face the same real interest rate on assets and liabilities. The United States borrows low and lends high. For most poorer countries, the opposite is true. Because of country risk, investors typically expect a risk premium before they will buy any assets issued by these countries, whether government debt, private debt or equity, or foreign direct investments.

Figure 17-3 plots government credit ratings (from Standard & Poor's) against public debt levels using historical data prior to the financial crisis of 2008 for a large sample of countries. Bond ratings are seen to be highly correlated with risk premiums. At the top of the figure are the advanced countries whose bonds were then rated AA or better. (At the time this sample was constructed, before the financial crisis, almost all the advanced countries had very high credit ratings and moderate debt levels; after the financial crisis and Great Recession, this rapidly changed as some advanced countries' debt rapidly ballooned and their credit ratings fell: some of them even fell quite far and started to look more like emerging markets).

Before the financial crisis, advanced-country bonds carried very small-risk premiums because investors were confident that these countries would repay their debts. In addition, the risk premiums did not increase markedly even as these countries went further into debt. In the bottom half of the figure, we see that emerging markets and developing countries inhabited a very different world. They had worse credit ratings and correspondingly higher-risk premiums. Only about half of the government bonds issued by these countries were considered investment grade, BBBand above; the rest were considered junk bonds. Investors demanded extra profit as compensation for the perceived risks of investing in many of these countries.

Figure 17-3 also shows that in poorer countries ratings deteriorated rapidly as debt levels rose, an effect that is not as strong in the advanced countries. This observation shows the sharp limits to borrowing for poorer countries: at some stage, the cost of borrowing becomes prohibitive, if it is possible at all.

This example brings us to the other assumption of the simple model that sometimes fails to hold in poorer countries, the assumption that the country can borrow or lend as much as it wants at the prevailing world real interest rate. On the lending side, it usually isn't a problem to save as much as you want. On the borrowing side, however, lenders often tell borrowers that they have reached a debt limit and can borrow no more. When that happens, access to external credit ceases, and anything additional a country wants to consume or invest has to be taken out of its own domestic output.

Sovereign Ratings and Public Debt Levels: Advanced Countries Versus Emerging Markets and Developing Countries The data shown are for the period from 1995 to 2005. The advanced countries (green) are at the top of the chart. Their credit ratings (vertical axis) do not drop very much in response to an increase in debt levels (horizontal axis). And ratings are always high investment grade. The emerging markets and developing countries (orange) are at the bottom of the graph. Their ratings are low or junk, and their ratings deteriorate as debt levels rise.

Note: The data shown are from the period before the global financial crisis. Since that event, many advanced countries have seen large increases in public debt and ratings downgrades, and in some cases the impacts have been serious, e.g., Iceland, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain.

Number of countries experiencing a "sudden stop"

# Sudden Stops in Emerging

Markets On occasion, capital flows can suddenly stop, meaning that those who wish to borrow anew or roll over an existing loan will be unable to obtain financing. These capital market shutdowns occur frequently in emerging markets.

Figure 17-4 illustrates the remarkable frequency with which emerging market countries experience this kind of isolation from global capital markets. Research by economists Guillermo Calvo and Carmen Reinhart has focused attention on sudden stops in the flow of external finance, especially in emerging markets. In a sudden stop, a borrower country sees its financial account surplus rapidly shrink (suddenly nobody wants to buy any more of its domestic assets) and so the current account deficit also must shrink (because there is no way to finance a trade imbalance). Reaching a debt limit can be a jolting macroeconomic shock for any economy, because it requires sudden and possibly large adjustments to national expenditure and its composition. Most seriously, output may drop if domestic investment is curtailed as a result of lack of access to external credit. As the constraints arising from hitting a debt limit start to bite, the upside of financial globalization recedes, and the downside of economic instability may take its place. In later chapters, we examine why credit market disruptions happen by looking in more detail at financial problems, crises, and default.

# 2 Gains from Consumption Smoothing

In the next two sections of this chapter, we bring together the long-run budget constraint and a simplified model of an economy to see how gains from financial globalization can be achieved in theory. First, we focus on the gains that result when an open economy uses external borrowing and lending to eliminate an important kind of risk, namely, undesirable fluctuations in aggregate consumption.

# The Basic Model

We retain all of the assumptions we made when developing the long-run budget constraint. There are no international transfers of income or capital, and the price level is perfectly flexible, so all nominal values are also real values, and so on. We also adopt some additional assumptions. These hold whether the economy is closed or open.

The economy's GDP or output is denoted  $Q$ . It is produced each period using labor as the only input. Production of GDP may be subject to shocks; depending on the shock, the same amount of labor input may yield different amounts of output.

- Households, which consume, are identical. This means we can think of a representative household, and use the terms "household" and "country" interchangeably. The country/household prefers a level of consumption  $C$  that is constant over time, or smooth. This level of smooth consumption must be consistent with the country/household's long-run budget constraint.
To keep the rest of the model simple—for now—we assume that consumption is the only source of demand, and that both investment  $I$  and government spending  $G$  are zero. Under these assumptions,  $GNE$  equals personal consumption expenditures  $C$ . In this simple case, if the country is open, the trade balance (GDP minus  $GNE$ ) equals  $Q$  minus  $C$ . The trade balance is positive (negative) only if  $Q$ , output, is greater (less) than consumption  $C$ .
Our analysis begins at time 0, and we assume the country begins with zero initial wealth inherited from the past, so that  $W_{-1}$  is zero.
- When the economy is open, we look at its interaction with the rest of the world (ROW). We assume that the country is small, ROW is large, and the prevailing world real interest rate is constant at  $r^*$ . In the numerical examples that follow, we assume  $r^* = 0.05 = 5\%$  per year.

Taken all together, these assumptions give us a special case of the LRBC that requires the present value of current and future trade balances to equal zero (because initial wealth is zero):

0 = Present value of TB = Present value of Q - Present value of C

Initial wealth is zero

Present value of GDP

Present value of GNE or equivalently,

$$
\underbrace {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f} Q} _ {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f} G D P} = \underbrace {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f} C} _ {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f} G N E} \tag {17-4}
$$

Remember, this equation says that the LRBC will hold, and the present value of current and future  $TB$  will be zero, if and only if the present value of current and future  $Q$  equals the present value of current and future  $C$ .

# Consumption Smoothing: A Numerical Example and Generalization

Now that we've clarified the assumptions for our model, we can explore how countries smooth consumption by examining two cases:

A closed economy, in which  $TB = 0$  in all periods, external borrowing and lending are not possible, and the LRBC is automatically satisfied

An open economy, in which  $TB$  does not have to be zero, borrowing and lending are possible, and we must verify that the LRBC is satisfied

Let's begin with a numerical example that illustrates the gains from consumption smoothing. We will generalize the result later.

Closed Versus Open Economy: No Shocks Table 17-1 provides a numerical example for our model economy when it is closed and experiences no shocks. Output  $Q$  is 100 units in each period, and all output is devoted to consumption. The present value of 100 in each period starting in year 0 equals the present value of 100 in year 0, which is simply 100, plus the present value of 100 in every subsequent year, which is  $100 / 0.05 = 2,000$  [using Equation (17-2), from the case of a perpetual loan]. Thus, the present value of present and future output is 2,100.

If this economy were open rather than closed, nothing would be different. The LRBC is satisfied because there is a zero trade balance at all times. Consumption  $C$  is perfectly smooth: every year the country consumes all 100 units of its output, and this is the country's preferred consumption path. There are no gains from financial globalization because this open country prefers to consume only what it produces each year, and thus has no need to borrow or lend to achieve its preferred consumption path.

Closed Versus Open Economy: Shocks The smooth path for the closed economy cannot be maintained if it suffers shocks to output, such as one of the hurricanes discussed at the start of the chapter. Suppose there is a temporary unanticipated output shock of  $-21$  units in year 0. Output  $Q$  falls to 79 in year 0 and then returns to a level of 100 thereafter. The change in the present value of output is the drop of 21 in year 0. The present value of output falls from 2,100 to 2,079, a drop of  $1\%$ .

Over time, will consumption in an open economy respond to this shock in the same way closed-economy consumption does? In the closed economy, there is no doubt what happens. Because all output is consumed and there is no possibility of a trade imbalance, consumption necessarily falls to 79 in year 0 and then rises back to 100 in year 1 and stays there forever. The path of consumption is no longer smooth, as shown in Table 17-2.

In the open economy, however, a smooth consumption path is still attainable because the country can borrow from abroad in year 0, and then repay over time. The country can't afford its original smooth consumption path of 100 every period, because the present value of output is now less. So what smooth consumption path can it afford?

A Closed or Open Economy with No Shocks Output equals consumption. Trade balance is zero. Consumption is smooth.

In the first section of this chapter, we spent some time deriving the LRBC. Now we can see why: the LRBC, given by Equation (17-4), is the key to determining a smooth consumption path in the face of economic shocks. Once we establish the present value of output, we know the present value of consumption, because these must be the same; from this fact we can figure out how to smooth consumption.

In this example, the present value of output  $Q$  has fallen  $1\%$  (from 2,100 to 2,079), so the present value of consumption must also fall by  $1\%$ . How should the country achieve this? Consumption can remain smooth, and satisfy the LRBC, if it falls by  $1\%$  (from 100 to 99) in every year. To double-check this logic, we compute the present value of  $C$ , using the perpetual loan formula again:  $99 + 99 / 0.05 = 99 + 1,980 = 2,079$ . Because the present value of  $C$  and the present value of  $Q$  are equal, the LRBC is satisfied.

Table 17-3 shows the path of all the important macroeconomic aggregates for the open economy. In year 0, the country runs a trade balance of  $TB = -20$  (a deficit), because output  $Q$  is 79 and consumption  $C$  is 99. In subsequent years, when output is 100, the country keeps consumption at 99, and has a trade balance  $TB = +1$  (a surplus).

Offsetting this  $+1$  trade balance, the country must make net factor payments  $N F I A = -1$  in the form of interest paid. The country must borrow 20 in year 0, and then make, in perpetuity,  $5\%$  interest payments of 1 unit on the 20 units borrowed.

In year 0, the current account  $CA$  ( $= TB + NFLA$ ) is -20. In all subsequent years, net factor income from abroad is -1 and the trade balance is +1, implying that the current account is 0, with no further borrowing. The country's external wealth  $W$  is therefore -20 in all periods, corresponding to the perpetual loan taken out in year 0. External wealth is constant at -20; it does not explode because interest payments are made in full each period and no further borrowing is required.

The lesson is clear. When output fluctuates, a closed economy cannot smooth consumption, but an open one can.

Generalizing The lesson of our numerical example applies to any situation in which a country wants to smooth its consumption when confronted with shocks. Suppose, more generally, that output  $Q$  and consumption  $C$  are initially stable at some value with  $Q = C$  and external wealth of zero. The LRBC is satisfied because the trade balance is zero at all times.

Now suppose output unexpectedly falls in year 0 by an amount  $\Delta Q$ , and then returns to its prior value for all future periods. The loss of output in year 0 reduces the present value of output (GDP) by the amount  $\Delta Q$ . To meet the LRBC, the country must lower the present value of consumption by the same amount. A closed economy accomplishes this by lowering its consumption by the whole amount of  $\Delta Q$  in year 0. That is its only option! An open economy, however, lowers its consumption uniformly (every period) by a smaller amount,  $\Delta C < \Delta Q$ . But how big a reduction is needed to meet the LRBC?

Because consumption falls less than output in year 0, the country will run a trade deficit of  $\Delta Q - \Delta C < 0$  in year 0. The country must borrow from other nations an amount equal to this trade deficit, and external wealth falls by the amount of that new debt. In subsequent years, output returns to its normal level but consumption stays at its reduced level, so trade surpluses of  $\Delta C$  are run in all subsequent years.

Because the LRBC requires that these surpluses be large enough to service the debt, we know how large the drop in consumption must be. A loan of  $\Delta Q - \Delta C$  in year 0 requires interest payments of  $r^{*}(\Delta Q - \Delta C)$  in later years. If the subsequent trade surpluses of  $\Delta C$  are to cover these interest payments, then we know that  $\Delta C$  must be chosen so that

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/886590ff69c5e476165c336b10b1a73cce53498a7c1ee44ffb6e533112076abd.jpg)

To find out how big a cut in consumption is necessary, we rearrange and find that

$$
\Delta C = \frac {r ^ {*}}{1 + r ^ {*}} \Delta Q
$$

Note that the fraction in the above equation is between zero and 1. Thus, the generalized lesson is that an open economy only needs to lower its steady consumption level by a fraction of the size of the temporary output loss. [For instance, in the previous numerical example,  $\Delta C = (0.05 / 1.05) \times (21) = 1$ , so consumption had to fall by 1 unit.]

Smoothing Consumption When a Shock Is Permanent We just showed how an open economy uses international borrowing to smooth consumption in response to a temporary shock to output. When the shock is permanent, however, the outcome is different. With a permanent shock, output will be lower by  $\Delta Q$  in all years, so the only way either a closed or open economy can satisfy the LRBC while keeping consumption smooth is to cut consumption by  $\Delta C = \Delta Q$  in all years. This is optimal, even in an open economy, because consumption remains smooth, although at a reduced level.

Comparing the results for a temporary shock and a permanent shock, we see an important point: consumers can smooth out temporary shocks—they have to adjust a bit, but the adjustment is far smaller than the shock itself—but they must adjust immediately and fully to permanent shocks. For example, if your income drops by  $50\%$  just this month, you might borrow to make it through this month with minimal adjustment in spending; however, if your income is going to remain  $50\%$  lower in every subsequent month, then you need to cut your spending permanently.

# Summary: Save for a Rainy Day

Financial openness allows countries to "save for a rainy day." This section's lesson has a simple household analogy. If you cannot use financial institutions to lend (save) or borrow (dissave), you have to spend what you earn each period. If you have unusually low income, you have little to spend. If you have a windfall, you have to spend it all. Borrowing and lending to smooth consumption fluctuations makes a household better off. The same applies to countries.

In a closed economy, consumption must equal output in every period, so output fluctuations immediately generate consumption fluctuations. In an open economy, the desired smooth consumption path can be achieved by running a trade deficit during bad times and a trade surplus during good times. By extension, deficits and surpluses can also be used to finance extraordinary and temporary emergency spending needs, such as the costs of war (see Side Bar: Wars and the Current Account).

# SIDE BAR

# Wars and the Current Account

Our theory of consumption smoothing can take into account temporary and "desired" consumption shocks. The most obvious example of such a shock is war.

Although we assumed zero government spending above, in reality, countries' consumption includes private consumption  $C$  and public consumption  $G$ . It is simple to augment the model to include  $G$  as well as  $C$ . Under this circumstance, the constraint is that the present value of GNE  $(C + G)$  must equal the present value of GDP. A war means a temporary increase in  $G$ .

Borrowing internationally to finance war-related costs goes back centuries. Historians have long argued about the importance of the creation of the British public debt market as a factor in the country's rise to global leadership compared with powerful continental rivals like France. From the early 1700s (which saw rapid financial development led by major financiers like the Rothschilds) to the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the British were able to maintain good credit; they could borrow domestically and externally cheaply and easily (often from the Dutch) to finance the simultaneous needs of capital formation for the Industrial Revolution and high levels of military spending.

In the nineteenth century, borrowing to finance war-related costs became more commonplace. In the 1870s, the defeated French issued bonds in London to finance a reparation payment to the triumphant Germans. World War I and World War II saw massive lending by the United States to other Allied countries. More recently, when the United States went to war in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003), there was a sharp increase in the U.S. current account deficit and in external debt due in part to war-related borrowing.

Better at raising armies than finance, the French fought with one hand tied behind their back.

# APPLICATION

# Consumption Volatility and Financial Openness

Does the evidence show that countries avoid consumption volatility by embracing financial globalization? A simple test might be to compute the ratio of consumption volatility to output volatility (where volatility equals the standard deviation of the growth rate). If consumption smoothing is achieved, the computed ratio ought to fall. In fact, in our simple model of a small, open economy that can borrow or lend without limit, and that prefers a perfectly smooth path of consumption, this ratio should fall to zero because the economy can take advantage of financial globalization by borrowing and lending to other countries. In practice, this ratio will not be zero if all countries are affected by common global shocks. For example, if every country suffers a negative shock, every country will want to borrow, but that will not be possible: if all countries want to borrow, no countries will want to lend. In practice, however, not all shocks are global, so countries ought to be able to achieve some reduction in consumption volatility through external finance. (We consider the importance of local and global shocks later in this chapter.)

With this in mind, Figure 17-5 presents some discouraging evidence. On the horizontal axis, countries are sorted into 10 groups (deciles) from those that participate least in financial globalization (are least financially liberalized) to those that participate

FIGURE 17-5

Consumption Volatility Relative to Output Volatility For a very large sample of 170 countries over the period 1995 to 2004, we compute the ratio of consumption volatility to output volatility, expressed as a percentage. A ratio of less than  $100\%$  indicates that some consumption smoothing has been achieved. Countries are then assembled into 10 groups (deciles), ordered from least financially open (1) to most financially open (10). The average volatility in each group is shown. Only the most financially open countries have volatility ratios of less than  $100\%$ . The high ratios in groups 1 to 8 show, perversely, that consumption is even more volatile than output in these countries.

Note: Volatility is measured by the standard deviation of real output or consumption growth according to the Penn World Tables.

most. On the left are least open countries with tight capital controls (generally poorer countries), on the right are the more open countries that permit free movement of capital (mostly advanced countries). For all these countries, we assess their ability to smooth total consumption  $(C + G)$  in the period from 1995 to 2004 using annual data. In closed countries, we would expect that the volatility of consumption would be similar to the volatility of output (GDP) so that the ratio of the two would be close to  $100\%$ . But if an open country were able to smooth consumption in line with our simple model, this ratio ought to be lower than  $100\%$ .

The figure shows that most groups of countries have an average consumption-to-output volatility ratio of well above  $100\%$ . Moreover, as financial liberalization increases, this ratio shows little sign of decrease until fairly high levels of liberalization are reached (around the seventh or eighth decile). Indeed, until we get to the ninth and tenth deciles, all of these ratios are above  $100\%$ . Similar findings have been found using a variety of tests, and it appears that only at a very high level of financial liberalization does financial globalization deliver modest consumption-smoothing benefits.

Why are these findings so far from the predictions of our model? In poorer countries, some of the relatively high consumption volatility must be unrelated to financial openness—it is there even in closed countries. In the real world, households are not identical and global capital markets do not reach every person. Some people and firms do not or cannot participate in even domestic financial markets, perhaps because of backward financial systems. Other problems may stem from the way financial markets operate (e.g., poor transparency and regulation) in emerging market countries that are partially open and/or have partially developed their financial systems.

The evidence may not imply a failure of financial globalization, but it does not provide a ringing endorsement either. Consumption-smoothing gains may prove elusive for emerging markets until they advance further by improving poor governance and weak institutions, developing their financial systems, and pursuing further financial liberalization.

# Precautionary Saving, Reserves, and Sovereign Wealth Funds

One obstacle to consumption smoothing in poorer countries is the phenomenon of sudden stops, which we noted earlier. If poorer countries can't count on credit lines to be there when they need them, they may fall back on an alternative strategy of engaging in precautionary saving, whereby the government acquires a buffer of external assets, a "rainy day fund." That is, rather than allowing external wealth to fluctuate around an average of zero, with the country sometimes being in debt and sometimes being a creditor, the country maintains a higher positive "average balance" in its external wealth account to reduce or even eliminate the need to go into a net debt position. This approach is costly, because the country must sacrifice consumption to build up the buffer. However, poor countries may deem the cost to be worthwhile if it allows them to smooth consumption more reliably once the buffer is established.

In the world economy today, precautionary saving has been on the rise and it takes two forms. The first is the accumulation of foreign reserves by central banks. Foreign reserves are safe assets denominated in foreign currency, like U.S. Treasury securities and other low-risk debt issued by governments in rich, solvent countries. They can be used not only for precautionary saving but for other purposes, such as maintaining a fixed exchange rate. As external assets on the nation's balance sheet, these reserves can be deployed during a sudden stop to cushion the blow to the domestic economy. Many economists argue that some part or even the greater part of reserve accumulation in recent years in emerging markets is driven by this precautionary motive.[10]

The second form of precautionary saving by governments is through what are called sovereign wealth funds, state-owned asset management companies that invest some government savings (possibly including central bank reserves) overseas. Often, the asset management companies place the government savings in safe assets; increasingly, however, the funds are being placed in riskier assets such as equity and FDI. Some countries, such as Norway (which had an oil boom in the 1970s), use such funds to save windfall gains from the exploitation of natural resources for future needs. Many newer funds have appeared in emerging markets and developing countries (such as Singapore, China, Malaysia, and Taiwan), but these funds have been driven more by precautionary saving than resource booms.

As of March 2013, the countries with the biggest sovereign wealth funds were China ( $1.2 trillion), Abu Dhabi ($ 745 billion), Norway ($716 billion), and Saudi Arabia ($538 billion), with other large funds (more than 75 billion each) in Kuwait, Russia, Singapore, Qatar, Libya, and Australia.[11]

Most observers believe it is likely that sovereign wealth funds will continue to grow in size, and that their use will spread to other countries (see Headlines: Copper-Bottomed Insurance). It is interesting that, despite having a legitimate economic rationale, these funds may generate international tensions, as they already have, by attempting to acquire politically sensitive equity and FDI assets from advanced countries.

# 3 Gains from Efficient Investment

Suppose an economy has opened up, and is taking full advantage of the gains from consumption smoothing. Has it completely exploited the benefits of financial globalization? The answer is no, because openness delivers gains not only on the consumption side but also on the investment side by improving a country's ability to augment its capital stock and take advantage of new production opportunities.

# The Basic Model

To illustrate these investment gains, we must refine the model we have been using by abandoning the assumption that output can be produced using only labor. We now assume that producing output requires labor and capital, which is created over time by investing output. When we make this change, the long-run budget constraint in

# HEADLINES

# Copper-Bottomed Insurance

Many developing countries experience output volatility. Sovereign wealth funds can buffer these shocks, as recent experience in Chile has shown.

Thousands of government workers marched on downtown Santiago [in November 2008], burning an effigy of Chilean Finance Minister Andres Velasco and calling him "disgusting" as a strike for higher wages paralyzed public services.

Five months later, polls show that Velasco is President Michelle Bachelet's most popular minister. During a three-year copper boom he and central bank President Jose De Gregorio set aside 48.6 billion, more than 30 percent of the country's gross domestic product, that he is now using for tax cuts, subsidies and cash handouts to poor families.

The Chilean peso has risen almost 10 percent against the dollar this year to become the best-performing currency among emerging markets. The country's economy is expected to grow 0.1 percent in 2009, as the region contracts 1.5 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund… .

Velasco, 48, applied the lessons learned from decades of economic failure in Latin America—ones he said could also help the U.S. The current crisis followed "a massive regulatory failure in many advanced financial markets over the last decade or so," Velasco said in an interview April 21 [2009] in his office overlooking the presidential palace in downtown Santiago.

"This is a movie that may be novel to some Americans, but this is a movie that people in other places of the world, Chile included, know we have seen," said Velasco, who is scheduled to meet April 25 with Federal Reserve Chairman

Ben S. Bernanke in Washington. "We know how it begins, how it unfolds and how it ends." . .

Commodity-driven swings of boom and bust have defined Latin America's economic history for the past 100 years.

"That is a cycle that needs to be ended," Velasco said. "We have been out to show that a Latin American country can manage properly, and not mismanage, a commodity cycle. You save in times of abundance, and you invest in lean times."

When Velasco joined Bachelet's new cabinet in March 2006, the price of copper had risen by more than half in 12 months to 2.25 a pound. Taxes and profits from state-owned Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, provide about 15 percent of government revenue. Bachelet, 57, Chile's second consecutive socialist president, came under almost immediate pressure to start spending the revenue.

Students went on strike in May of that year, demanding more money for education. More than 800,000 people protested at high schools and universities, and police with water cannons and tear gas arrested more than 1,000. Velasco reiterated his commitment to "prudent fiscal policies" as politicians from the governing coalition demanded he resign…

In his first three years in office, Velasco posted the biggest budget surpluses since the country returned to democracy in 1990. In 2007, Chile became a net creditor for the first time since independence from Spain in 1810.

Last July [2008], copper reached a record of  $4.08 a pound. By year-end, the central bank had built$ 23.2 billion of reserves. The government had $22.7 billion in offshore funds and about $2.8 billion in its own holdings.

After Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s September 15 bankruptcy sparked a global credit freeze, Velasco and De Gregorio had the equivalent of more than 30 percent of GDP available if needed to shore up Chile's banks and defend the peso.

The price of copper plummeted 52 percent from September 30 to year-end, and Velasco dusted off his checkbook. In the first week of January, he and Bachelet unveiled a 4 billion package of tax cuts and subsidies.

"He has been vindicated," said Luis Oganes, head of Latin American research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, who studied under Velasco…

Velasco's stimulus spending, including 40,000-peso (68.41) handouts to 1.7 million poor families, has paid off politically. His approval rating almost doubled to 57 percent in March from a low of 31 percent in August…. He is now the most well-liked member of the government, second only to the president at 62 percent.

"People finally understood what was behind his 'stinginess' of early years," said Sebastian Edwards, a Chilean economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "That explains the rise in his popularity."

Equation (17-4) must be modified to include investment  $I$  as a component of GNE. For simplicity, however, we still assume that government consumption  $G$  is zero. With this change, the LRBC becomes

$$
\begin{array}{c} 0 = \text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f T B} \\ \swarrow \\ \text {I n i t i a l w e i l t h i s z e r o} \end{array}
$$

Because the  $TB$  is output (Q) minus expenditure  $(C + I)$ , we can rewrite this last equation in the following form:

$$
\underbrace {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f} Q} _ {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f} G D P} = \underbrace {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f} C + \text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f} I} _ {\text {P r e s e n t v a l u e o f} G N E} \tag {17-5}
$$

The LRBC will hold if and only if the present value of output  $Q$  equals the present value of expenditure  $(C + I)$ .

Using this modified LRBC, we now study investment and consumption decisions in two cases:

A closed economy, in which external borrowing and lending are not possible, the trade balance is zero in all periods, and the LRBC is automatically satisfied

An open economy, in which borrowing and lending are possible, the trade balance can be more or less than zero, and we must verify that the LRBC is satisfied

# Efficient Investment: A Numerical Example and Generalization

Let's start with a country that has output of 100, consumption  $C$  of 100, no investment, a zero trade balance, and zero external wealth. If that state persisted, the LRBC would be satisfied, just as it was in the prior numerical example with consumption smoothing. This outcome describes the optimal path of consumption in both the closed and open economies when output is constant and there are no shocks, that is, nothing happens here that makes the country want to alter its output and consumption.

But now suppose there is a shock in year 0 that takes the form of a new investment opportunity. For example, it could be that in year 0 engineers discover that by building a new factory with a new machine, the country can produce a certain good much more cheaply than current technology allows. Or perhaps there is a resource discovery, but a mine must first be built to extract the minerals from the earth. What happens next? We turn first to a numerical example and then supply a more general answer.

We assume that the investment (in machines or factories or mines) would require an expenditure of 16 units, and that the investment will pay off in future years by increasing the country's output by 5 units in year 1 and all subsequent years (but not in year 0).

The country now faces some choices. Should it make this investment? And if it does, will it make out better if it is open or closed? We find the answers to these questions by looking at how an open economy would deal with the opportunity to invest, and then showing why a country would make itself worse off by choosing to be closed, thereby relinquishing at least some of the gains the investment opportunity offers.

As in the previous example, the key to solving this problem is to work with the LRBC and see how the choices a country makes to satisfy it have to change as circumstances do. Before the investment opportunity shock, output and consumption were each 100 in all periods, and had a present value of 2,100. Investment was zero in every period, and the LRBC given by Equation (17-5) was clearly satisfied. If the country decides to not act on the investment opportunity, this situation continues unchanged whether the economy is closed or open.

Now suppose an open economy undertakes the investment. First, we must calculate the difference this would make to the country's resources, as measured by the present value of output. Output would be 100 today and then 105 in every subsequent year. The present value of this stream of output is 100 plus  $105 / 0.05$  or 2,200. This is an increase of 100 over the old present value of output (2,100). The present value of the addition to output (of 5 units every subsequent period) is 100.

Can all of this additional output be devoted to consumption? No, because the country has had to invest 16 units in the current period to obtain this future stream of additional output. In this scenario, because all investment occurs in the current period, 16 is the present value of investment in the modified LRBC given by Equation (17-5).

Looking at that LRBC, we've calculated the present value of output (2,200), and now we have the present value of investment (16). We can see that the present value of consumption must equal 2,200 minus 16, or 2,184. This is  $4\%$  higher than it was without the investment. Even though some expenditure has to be devoted to investment, the resources available for consumption have risen by  $4\%$  in present value terms (from 2,100 without the investment, to 2,184 with it).

We can now find the new level of smooth consumption each period that satisfies the LRBC. Because the present value of  $C$  has risen by  $4\%$  from 2,100 to 2,184, the country can afford to raise consumption  $C$  in all periods by  $4\%$  from 100 to 104. (As a check, note that  $104 + 104 / 0.05 = 2,184$ .) Is the country better off if it makes the investment? Yes—not only does its consumption remain smooth, but it is also  $4\%$  higher in all periods.

Table 17-4 lays out the details of this case. In year 0, consumption  $C$  is 104, investment  $I$  is 16, and  $GNE$  is 120. The trade balance is -20 because output  $Q$  is only 100. The country must borrow 20 units in year 0 to fund the investment of 16 and the 4 additional units of consumption the country can afford as a result of the investment. In all future years, consumption  $C$  is 104, and because there is no subsequent investment,  $GNE$  is also 104. Output  $Q$  is 105, and the trade balance is +1.

The initial trade deficit of 20 in year 0 results in an external debt of 20. As a perpetual loan, with an interest rate of  $5\%$ , this debt of 20 must be serviced by net interest payments of  $-1$  in each subsequent year if the LRBC is to be satisfied. The interest payment of  $-1$  offsets the trade surplus of  $+1$  each period forever. Hence, the current account is zero in all future years, with no further borrowing, and the country's external wealth is  $-20$  in all periods. External wealth does not explode, and the LRBC is satisfied.

This outcome is preferable to any outcome a closed economy can achieve. To attain an output level of 105 from year 1 on, a closed economy would have to cut consumption to 84 in year 0 to free up 16 units for investment. Although the country would then enjoy consumption of 105 in all subsequent years, this is not a smooth consumption path! The open economy could choose this path (cutting consumption to 84 in year 0), because it satisfies the LRBC. It won't choose this path, however, because by making the investment in this way, it cannot smooth its consumption and cannot smooth it at a higher level. The open economy is better off making the investment and smoothing consumption, two goals that the closed economy cannot simultaneously achieve.

Generalizing The lesson of our numerical example applies to any situation in which a country confronts new investment opportunities. Suppose that a country starts with zero external wealth, constant output  $Q$ , consumption  $C$  equal to output, and investment  $I$  equal to zero. A new investment opportunity appears requiring  $\Delta K$  units of output in year 0. This investment will generate an additional  $\Delta Q$  units of output in year 1 and all later years (but not in year 0).

Ultimately, consumers care about consumption. In an open economy, they can smooth their consumption, given future output. The constant level of consumption is limited only by the present value of available resources, as expressed by the LRBC. Maximizing the level of consumption is the same as maximizing the present value of consumption. Rearranging Equation (17-5), the LRBC requires that the present value of consumption must equal the present value of output minus the present value of investment. How is this present value maximized?

The increase in the present value of output  $PV(Q)$  comes from extra output in every year but year 0, and the present value of these additions to output is, using Equation (17-2),

$$
\text {C h a n g e i n p r e s e n t v a l u e o f o u t p u t} = \frac {\Delta Q}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right)} + \frac {\Delta Q}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {2}} + \frac {\Delta Q}{\left(1 + r ^ {*}\right) ^ {3}} + \dots = \frac {\Delta Q}{r ^ {*}}
$$

The change in the present value of investment  $PV(I)$  is simply  $\Delta K$ .

This means the investment will increase the present value of consumption—and hence will be undertaken—if and only if  $\Delta Q / r^{*} \geq \Delta K$ . There are two ways to look at this conclusion. Rearranging, investment is undertaken when

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/480ebb82d8783a0c05705237f013c78f42cd6f367337202f92f3d22ae58265cc.jpg)

The intuition here is that investment occurs up to the point at which the annual benefit from the marginal unit of capital  $(\Delta Q)$  equals or exceeds the annual cost of borrowing the funds to pay for that capital  $(r^{*}\Delta K)$ .

Putting it another way, dividing by  $\Delta K$ , investment is undertaken when

$$
\underbrace {\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta K}} _ {M P K} \quad \geq \underbrace {r ^ {*}} _ {\text {W o r l d r e a l i n t e r e s t r a t e}} \tag {17-6}
$$

Marginal product of capital

This is a standard formula for the optimal or efficient level of investment and may look familiar from other courses in economics. Firms will take on investment projects as long as the marginal product of capital (MPK) is at least as great as the real interest rate.

# Summary: Make Hay While the Sun Shines

In an open economy, firms borrow and repay to undertake investment that maximizes the present value of output. Households also borrow and lend to smooth consumption, but these borrowing and lending decisions are separate from those of firms.

When investing, an open economy sets its MPK equal to the world real rate of interest. If conditions are unusually good (high productivity), it makes sense to invest more capital and produce more output. Conversely, when conditions turn bad (low productivity), it makes sense to lower capital inputs and produce less output. This strategy maximizes the present value of output minus investment. Households then address the separate problem of how to smooth the path of consumption when output changes. A closed economy must be self-sufficient. Any resources invested are resources not consumed. More investment implies less consumption. This creates a trade-off. When investment opportunities are good, the country wants to invest to generate higher output in the future. Anticipating that higher output, the country wants to consume more today, but it cannot—it must consume less to invest more.

Proverbially, financial openness helps countries to "make hay while the sun shines"—and, in particular, to do so without having to engage in a trade-off against the important objective of consumption smoothing. The lesson here has a simple household analogy. Suppose you find a great investment opportunity. If you have no financial dealings with the outside world, you would have to sacrifice consumption and save to finance the investment.

# Delinking Saving from Investment

The story of the Norwegian oil boom provides a good illustration of our theory about investment and financial openness. North Sea oil was discovered in the 1960s, but the mass exploitation of this resource was unprofitable because cheap and plentiful supplies of oil were being produced elsewhere, primarily in the Persian Gulf. Then came the first "oil shock" in the early 1970s, when the cartel of Oil Producing and Exporting Countries (OPEC) colluded to raise world oil prices dramatically, a shock that was (correctly) viewed as permanent. At these higher oil prices, it suddenly made sense to exploit North Sea oil. Starting in the early 1970s, oil platforms, pipelines, refineries, and terminals were sprouting offshore and along the coast of Norway, causing its capital stock to permanently increase in response to a new productive investment opportunity.

Figure 17-6 shows the path of saving  $(S)$  and investment  $(I)$  measured as ratios of GDP in Norway from 1965 to 1990. The oil boom is clearly visible in the investment share of GDP, which in the 1970s rose about 10 percentage points above its typical level. Had Norway been a closed economy, this additional investment would have been financed by a decrease in the share of output devoted to public and private consumption. As you can see, no such sacrifice was necessary. Norway's saving rate was flat in this period or even fell slightly. In Norway's open economy, saving and investment were delinked and the difference was made up by the current account,  $CA = S - I$ , which moved sharply into deficit, approaching minus  $15\%$  of GDP at one point. Thus, all of the short-run increase in investment was financed by foreign investment in Norway, much of it by multinational oil companies.

Is Norway a special case? Economists have examined large international datasets to see whether there is general evidence that countries can unlink investment decisions from saving decisions as the Norwegians did. One approach follows the pioneering work of Martin Feldstein and Charles Horioka.[12] They estimated what fraction  $\beta$  of each additional dollar saved tended to be invested in the same country. In other words, in their model, if saving rose by an amount  $\Delta S$ , they estimated that investment would rise by an amount  $\Delta I = \beta \Delta S$ . In a closed economy, the "savings retention" measure  $\beta$  would equal 1, but they argued that increasing financial openness would tend to push  $\beta$  below 1.

For example, suppose one were to estimate  $\beta$  for the period 1980 to 2000 for three groups of countries with differing degrees of financial integration within the group: in a sample of countries in the European Union, where international financial integra

FIGURE 17-6

The Oil Boom in Norway Following a large increase in oil prices in the early 1970s, Norway invested heavily to exploit oil fields in the North Sea. Norway took advantage of openness to finance a temporary increase in investment by running a very large current account deficit, thus increasing its indebtedness to the rest of the world. At its peak, the current account deficit was more than  $10\%$  of GDP.

tion had advanced furthest, the estimated value of  $\beta$  is 0.26, meaning that  $26\%$  of each additional dollar saved tended to be invested in the same country; in a sample of all developed countries with a somewhat lower level of financial integration, the estimate of  $\beta$  is 0.39; and in a sample of emerging markets, where financial integration was lower still, the estimate of  $\beta$  is 0.67.[13] These data thus indicate that financially open countries seem to have a greater ability to unlink saving and investment, in that they have a much lower "savings retention" measure  $\beta$ .

# Can Poor Countries Gain from Financial Globalization?

Our analysis shows that if the world real interest rate is  $r^*$  and a country has investment projects for which the marginal product of capital MPK exceeds  $r^*$ , then the country should borrow from the rest of the world to finance investment in these projects. Keep this conclusion in mind as we now examine an enduring question in international macroeconomics: Why doesn't more capital flow to poor countries?

Production Function Approach To look at this question carefully, economists must take a stand on what determines a country's marginal product of capital. For this purpose, economists usually employ a version of a production function that maps available capital per worker,  $k = K / L$ , and the prevailing level of productivity  $A$  to the level of output per worker,  $q = Q / L$ , where  $Q$  is GDP.

A simple and widely used production function takes the form

$$
\underset { \begin{array}{c} \swarrow \\ \text {O u t p u t} \\ \text {p e r} \\ \text {w o r k e r} \end{array} } {q} = \underset { \begin{array}{c} \swarrow \\ \text {P r o d u c t i v i t y} \\ \text {l e v e l} \end{array} } {\mathcal {A}} \times \underset { \begin{array}{c} \swarrow \\ \text {C a p i t a l p e r} \\ \text {w o r k e r} \end{array} } {k ^ {\theta}}
$$ where  $\theta$  is a number between 0 and 1 that measures the contribution of capital to production. $^{14}$  Specifically,  $\theta$  is the elasticity of output with respect to capital (i.e., a  $1\%$  increase in capital per worker generates a  $0\%$  increase in output per worker). In the real world,  $\theta$  has been estimated to be approximately one-third, and this is the value we employ here. $^{15}$  An illustration is given in the top part of Figure 17-7, panel (a), which graphs the production function for the case in which  $\theta = 1/3$  and the productivity level is set at a reference level of 1, so  $A = 1$ . Thus, for this case  $q = k^{1/3}$ .


With this production function, what is the marginal product of capital, MPK? It is the slope of the production function, the incremental change in output per worker  $\Delta q$  divided by the incremental change in capital per worker  $\Delta k$ . As we can see from the figure, capital's marginal product MPK (the extra output we get by increasing capital per worker) decreases as  $k$  increases. Indeed, from the preceding formula, we can find that MPK, or the slope of the production function, is given by

$$

M P K = \frac {\Delta q}{\Delta k} = \underbrace {\theta A k ^ {\theta - 1}} _ {\substack {\text {Slope of the}\\ \text {production function}}} = \theta \times \frac {q}{k}

$$

Why Doesn't Capital Flow to Poor Countries? If poor and rich countries share the same level of productivity (a common production function), then MPK must be very high in poor countries, as shown in panel (a). For example, if  $B$  represents Mexico and  $R$  the United States, we would expect to see large flows of capital to poor countries, until their capital per worker  $k$  and, hence, output per worker  $q$  rise to levels seen in the rich world (movement from point  $B$  to point  $R$ ). The result is convergence. This doesn't happen in reality. Poor and rich countries have different levels of productivity (different production functions) and so MPK may not be much higher in poor countries than it is in rich countries, as shown in panel (b). The poor country (Mexico) is now at  $C$  and not at  $B$ . Now investment occurs only until MPK falls to the rest of the world level at point  $D$ . The result is divergence. Capital per worker  $k$  and output per worker  $q$  do not converge to the levels seen in the rich country.

(b) Different Production Functions in Rich and Poor Countries

Thus, in this special case, the marginal product of capital is proportional to output per worker divided by capital per worker (the output-capital ratio) or the average product of capital. The MPK for the case we are studying, in which  $\theta = 1/3$  and  $A = 1$ , is shown in the bottom part of Figure 17-7, panel (a).

A Benchmark Model: Countries Have Identical Productivity Levels To see how a country responds to the possibilities opened up by financial globalization, let's look at what determines the incentive to invest in small open economies of the type we are studying, assuming they all have access to the same level of productivity,  $A = 1$ .

To understand when such a country will invest, we need to understand how its MPK changes as  $k$  changes. For example, suppose the country increases  $k$  by a factor of 8. Because  $q = k^{1/3}$ ,  $q$  increases by a factor of 2 (the cube root of 8). Let's suppose this brings the country up to the U.S. level of output per worker. Because  $MPK = \theta \times q / k$  and because  $q$  has risen by a factor of 2, while  $k$  has risen by a factor of 8, MPK changes by a factor of 1/4; that is, it falls to one-fourth its previous level.

This simple model says that poor countries with output per worker of one-half the U.S. level have an MPK of four times the U.S level. Countries with one-quarter the U.S. per worker output level have an MPK of 16 times the U.S level, and so on.

To make the model concrete, let's see how well it applies to a comparison of the United States and Mexico in the late 1980s.[16] During this time, the United States produced approximately twice as much GDP per worker as Mexico. Now let's choose units such that all U.S. variables take the value 1, and Mexican variables are proportions of the corresponding U.S. variables. For example, with these units,  $q$  was 0.43 in Mexico in the late 1980s (i.e., output per worker in Mexico was  $43\%$  of output per worker in the United States).

Now consider the implications of assuming that the economies of Mexico and the United States were described by the same production function with a common productivity level,  $A = 1$ . In Figure 17-7, panel (a), the United States is at point  $R$  (for rich) and Mexico is at point  $B$ , and its low output implies a capital per worker  $k$  that is only  $8\%$  of the U.S. level. What is Mexico's marginal product of capital? It is 5.4 times the U.S. marginal product of capital. Why? As above, MPK is  $\theta$  (a constant for both countries equal to 1/3) times  $q / k$ . In the United States,  $q / k = 1$ ; in Mexico,  $q / k = 0.43 / 0.08 = 5.4$ .

We can think of the United States and other rich countries as representing the rest of the world—a large financially integrated region, from Mexico's point of view. The world real interest rate  $r^*$  is the opportunity cost of capital for the rest of the world, that is, the rich world's MPK. If the real interest rate  $r^*$  is, say,  $10\%$  in rich countries like the United States, then their MPK is  $10\%$ , and Mexico has an MPK of  $54\%$ !

To take an even more dramatic example, we could look at India, a much poorer country than Mexico. India's output per worker was just  $8.6\%$  of the U.S. level in 1988. Using our simple benchmark model, we would infer that the MPK in India was 135 times the U.S. level!

To sum up, the simple model says that the poorer the country, the higher its MPK, because of the twin assumptions of diminishing marginal product and a common productivity level. Investment ought to be very profitable in Mexico (and India, and all poor countries). Investment in Mexico should continue until Mexico is at point  $R$ .

Economists would describe such a trajectory for Mexico as convergence. If the world is characterized by convergence, countries can reach the level of capital per worker and output per worker of the rich country through investment and capital accumulation alone.

The Lucas Paradox: Why Doesn't Capital Flow from Rich to Poor Countries? Twenty or thirty years ago, a widespread view among economists was that poor countries had access to exactly the same technologies as rich countries, given the flow of ideas and knowledge around a globalizing world. This led economists to assume that if policies shifted to allow greater international movement of capital, foreign investment would flood into poor countries because their very poverty implied that capital was scarce in these countries, and therefore its marginal product was high.

But as Nobel laureate Robert Lucas wrote in his widely cited article "Why Doesn't Capital Flow from Rich to Poor Countries?:

If this model were anywhere close to being accurate, and if world capital markets were anywhere close to being free and complete, it is clear that, in the face of return differentials of this magnitude, investment goods would flow rapidly from the United States and other wealthy countries to India and other poor countries. Indeed, one would expect no investment to occur in the wealthy countries. . . . The assumptions on technology and trade conditions that give rise to this example must be drastically wrong, but exactly what is wrong with them, and what assumptions should replace them?18

What was drastically wrong was the assumption of identical productivity levels  $A$  across countries, as represented by the single production function in Figure 17-7, panel (a)? Although this model is often invoked, it is generally invalid. Can we do better?

An Augmented Model: Countries Have Different Productivity Levels To see why capital does not flow to poor countries, we now suppose that  $A$ , the productivity level, is different in the United States and Mexico, as denoted by country subscripts:

$$

\underline {{q _ {U S}}} \quad = \quad \underline {{A _ {U S} k _ {U S} ^ {\theta}}}

$$

Output per worker in the United States

U.S. production function

$$

\underbrace {q _ {M E X}} = \underbrace {A _ {M E X} k ^ {\theta} _ {M E X}}

$$

Output per worker Mexican production function in Mexico

Countries have potentially different production functions and different MPK curves, depending on their relative levels of productivity, as shown in Figure 17-7, panel (b). The Mexican curves are shown here as lower than the U.S. curves. We now show that this augmented model is a much better match with reality.

The earlier MPK equation holds for each country, so we can compute the ratios of country MPKs as

$$

\frac {M P K _ {M E X}}{M P K _ {U S}} = \frac {\left[ \theta q _ {M E X} / k _ {M E X} \right]}{\left[ \theta q _ {U S} / k _ {U S} \right]} = \frac {q _ {M E X} / q _ {U S}}{k _ {M E X} / k _ {U S}}

$$

Using this equation, we can see the importance of allowing productivity levels to differ across countries. We know that  $q_{MEX} / q_{US} = 0.43$ , but we can also obtain data on capital per worker that show  $k_{MEX} / k_{US} = 0.33$ . If we plug these numbers into the last expression, we find that MPK in Mexico is not 5.4 times the U.S. level, as we had earlier determined, but only about 1.3 times (0.43/0.33) the U.S. level. The smaller multiple is due to the lower productivity level that our revised model reveals in Mexico.

Put another way, the data show that Mexico's capital per worker is about one-third that of the United States. If the simple model were true, Mexico would have a level of output level per worker of  $(1/3)^{1/3} = 0.69$  or  $69\%$  of the U.S. level. However, Mexico's output per worker was much less, only  $0.43$  or  $43\%$  of the U.S. level. This gap can only be explained by a lower productivity level in Mexico. We infer that  $A$  in Mexico equals  $0.43 / 0.69 = 0.63$ , or  $63\%$  of that in the United States.

This means that Mexico's production function and MPK curves are lower than those for the United States. This more accurate representation of reality is shown in Figure 17-7, panel (b). Mexico is not at point  $B$ , as we assumed in panel (a); it is at point  $C$ , on a different (lower) production function and a different (lower) MPK curve. The MPK gap between Mexico and the United States is much smaller, which greatly reduces the incentive for capital to migrate to Mexico from the United States.

The measured MPK differentials in the augmented model do not seem to indicate a major failure of global capital markets to allocate capital efficiently. But the augmented model has very different implications for convergence. Mexico would borrow only enough to move from point  $C$  to point  $D$ , where its MPK equals  $r^*$ . This investment would raise its output per worker a little, but it would still be far below that of the United States.

# APPLCATION

# A Versus  $k$

In our previous calculations, we found that Mexico did not have a high level of MPK relative to the United States. Hence, we would not expect large flows of capital into Mexico but would expect Mexico to remain relatively poor even with access to global financial markets.

Is this conclusion true in general? What about other developing countries? Table 17-5 repeats the same exercise we just did for many developing countries, including Mexico. In all cases, predicted GDP gains due to financial globalization are large with the benchmark model, but disappointingly small once we augment the model to correct for productivity differences. Moreover, if we were to allow for the fact that gross national income (GNI) gains are less than GDP gains as a result of factor payments to foreign capital that would be due on foreign investment, then the net GNI gains would be smaller still.

This is a profound result. Once we allow for productivity differences, investment will not cause poor countries to reach the same level of capital per worker or output per worker as rich countries. Economists describe this outcome as one of long-run divergence between rich and poor countries. Unless poor countries can lift their levels of productivity (raise  $A$ ), access to international financial markets is of limited use. They may be able to usefully borrow capital, thereby increasing output per worker by some amount, but there are not enough opportunities for productive investment for complete convergence to occur.

Why Capital Doesn't Flow to Poor Countries The table shows data on output and capital per worker (columns 1 and 2). Column 3 shows the level of productivity relative to the United States that is implied by the data. Productivity differences are large for poor countries. If these differences are assumed away, then the gains from financial globalization in poor countries could be large (columns 4, 5). But if they remain, the gains will be small (columns 6, 7).

In the developing world, global capital markets typically are not failing. Rather, low levels of productivity  $A$  make investment unprofitable, leading to low output levels that do not produce convergence. But what exactly does  $A$  represent?

An older school of thought focused on  $A$  as reflecting a country's technical efficiency, construed narrowly as a function of its technology and management capabilities. Today, many economists believe there is very little blocking the flow of such knowledge between countries, and that the problem must instead be one of implementation. These economists believe that the level of  $A$  may primarily reflect a country's social efficiency, construed broadly to include institutions, public policies, and even cultural conditions such as the level of trust. Low productivity might then follow from low levels of human capital (poor education policies) or poor-quality institutions (bad governance, corruption, red tape, and poor provision of public goods including infrastructure). And indeed there is some evidence that, among poorer countries, more capital does tend to flow to the countries with better institutions.[19]

More Bad News? The augmented model shows that as long as productivity gaps remain, investment will be discouraged, and, regrettably, poor countries will not see their incomes converge to rich levels. If we now take some other factors into account, the predictions of the model about convergence are even less optimistic.

The model makes no allowance for risk premiums. Suppose the MPK is  $10\%$  in the United States and  $13\%$  in Mexico. The differential may be a risk premium Mexico must pay to foreign lenders that compensates them for the risk of investing in an emerging market (e.g., risks of regulatory changes, tax changes, expropriation, and other political risks). In this case, no additional capital flows into Mexico. In Figure 17-7, panel (b), Mexico stays at point  $C$  and its income does not increase at all.

- Risk premiums may be large enough to cause capital to flow "uphill" from poor to rich. If world capital markets impose a risk premium higher than  $3\%$ , say,  $7\%$ , then capital would actually leave Mexico for the United States, moving from the higher to the lower MPK region, in search of a "safe haven" that provides higher risk-adjusted returns. In Figure 17-7, panel (b), Mexico would move left of point  $C$  as capital flowed out, and per capita output would fall. Is this a relevant case? Yes. Figure 17-8 shows that risk premiums can be substantial in emerging markets, including Mexico. And U.S. Treasury securities data indicate that from 1994 to 2006, U.S. holdings of Mexican assets rose from  $50 billion to$ 65 billion, but Mexican holdings of U.S. assets rose from $5 billion to $95 billion; on net, capital moved north.

The model assumes that investment goods can be acquired at the same relative price in output terms everywhere. In fact, the model treats one unit of investment as the same as one unit of output. But in developing countries, it often costs much more than one unit of output to purchase one unit of capital goods. Poor countries often are ill-equipped to efficiently supply nontraded capital goods (such as buildings or bridges), and their imported capital goods (such as machinery and equipment) are often quite expensive because of trade costs (such as tariffs and transport costs).

The larger the risk premium, the more compensation investors require, given their concerns about the uncertainty of repayment.

The model assumes that the contribution of capital to production is equal across countries. In our estimates, we used  $1/3$  as the elasticity of output with respect to capital. But recent research suggests that capital's share may be much lower in many developing countries, where a large part of GDP is derived from natural resources with little use of physical capital. This lowers the MPK even more.[21]
The model suggests that foreign aid may do no better than foreign investors in promoting growth. The model doesn't care where additional capital comes from. Investments paid for by transfers (aid or debt relief) rather than private investments face the same low MPK and the same divergence result holds. Economists dispute whether foreign aid can make a difference to long-term development and growth, or if it is only an act of charity to prop up the poor (or even a total waste of money). The argument also extends to nonmarket and preferential lending offered to poor countries by international financial institutions such as the World Bank (see Side Bar: What Does the World Bank Do?). In support of the case that aid can make a difference, aid proponents argue that aid can finance public goods that can provide externalities sufficient to jolt a poor country out of a bad equilibrium or "poverty trap"—goods that private markets cannot provide (such as infrastructure, public health, and education). Aid skeptics reply that the evidence for such effects is weak, either because the links are not there or because in practice aid is so bureaucratized and subject to so many diversions and misappropriations that very little of it actually gets spent wisely (see Headlines: A Brief History of Foreign Aid).

# SIDE BAR

# What Does the World Bank Do?

The World Bank (worldbank.org), based in Washington, D.C., is one of the Bretton Woods "twins" established in 1944 (the other is the International Monetary Fund). Its main arm, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has 188 member countries. Its principal purpose is to provide financing and technical assistance to reduce poverty and promote sustained economic development in poor countries. A country's voting weight in the governance of the World Bank is based on the size of its capital contributions. The World Bank can raise funds at low interest rates and issue AAA-rated debt as good as that of any sovereign nation. It then lends to poor borrowers at low rates. Because the borrower nations could not obtain loans on these terms (or even any terms) elsewhere, the loans are a form of aid or transfer. In return for the preferential rate, the bank may approve a loan for a particular development purpose (building infrastructure, for example) or to support a policy reform package. Controversially, conditions may also be imposed on the borrowing nation, such as changes in trade or fiscal policy. As a result of sovereignty, the implementation of the conditions and the use of the loans have in some cases not turned out as intended, although outright default on these preferential loans is almost unheard of.


# HEADLINES

# A Brief History of Foreign Aid

Foreign aid is frequently on the political agenda. But can it make any difference?

In 1985, when Bob Geldof organized the rock spectacular Live Aid to fight poverty in Africa, he kept things simple. "Give us your fucking money" was his famous (if apocryphal) command to an affluent Western audience—words that embodied Geldof's conviction that charity alone could save Africa. He had no patience for complexity: we were rich, they were poor, let's fix it. As he once said to a luckless official in the Sudan, after seeing a starving person, "I'm not interested in the bloody system! Why has he no food?"

Whatever Live Aid accomplished, it did not save Africa. Twenty years later, most of the continent is still mired in poverty. So when, earlier this month, Geldof put together Live 8, another rock spectacular, the utopian rhetoric was ditched. In its place was talk about the sort of stuff that Geldof once despised—debt-cancellation schemes and the need for "accountability and transparency" on the part of African governments—and, instead of fund-raising, a call for the leaders of the G-8 economies to step up their commitment to Africa. (In other words, don't give us your fucking money; get interested in the bloody system.) Even after the G-8 leaders agreed to double aid to Africa, the prevailing mood was one of cautious optimism rather than euphoria.


That did not matter to the many critics of foreign aid, who mounted a lively backlash against both Live 8 and the G-8 summit. For them, continuing to give money to Africa is simply "pouring billions more down the same old ratholes," as the columnist Max Boot put it. At best, these critics say, it's money wasted; at worst, it turns countries into aid junkies, clinging to the World Bank for their next fix. Instead of looking for help, African countries need to follow the so-called Asian Tigers (countries like South Korea and Taiwan), which overcame poverty by pursuing what Boot called "superior economic policies."

Skepticism about the usefulness of alms to the Third World is certainly in order. Billions of dollars have ended up in the pockets of kleptocratic rulers—in Zaire alone, Mobutu Sese Soko stole at least four billion—and still more has been misspent on massive infrastructure boondoggles, like the twelve-billion-dollar Yacyreta Dam, between Argentina and Paraguay, which Argentina's former President called "a monument to corruption." And historically there has been little correlation between aid and economic growth.

This checkered record notwithstanding, it's a myth that aid is doomed to failure. Foreign aid funded the campaign to eradicate smallpox, and in the sixties it brought the Green Revolution in agriculture to countries like India and Pakistan, lifting living standards and life expectancies for hundreds of millions of people. As for the Asian nations that Africa is being told to emulate, they may have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, but at least they were provided with boots. In the postwar years, South Korea and Taiwan had the good fortune to become, effectively, client states of the U.S. Between 1946 and 1978, in fact, South Korea received nearly as much U.S. aid as the whole of Africa. Meanwhile, the billions that Taiwan got allowed it to fund a vast land-reform program and to eradicate malaria. And the U.S. gave the Asian Tigers more than money; it provided technical assistance and some military defense, and it offered preferential access to American markets.


Coincidence? Perhaps. But the two Middle Eastern countries that have shown relatively steady and substantial economic growth—Israel and Turkey—have also received tens of billions of dollars in U.S. aid. The few sub-Saharan African countries that have enjoyed any economic success at all of late—including Botswana, Mozambique, and Uganda—have been major aid recipients, as has

Costa Rica, which has the best economy in Central America. Ireland (which is often called the Celtic Tiger) has enjoyed sizable subsidies from the European Union. China was the World Bank's largest borrower for much of the past decade.

Nobody doubts that vast amounts of aid have been squandered, but there are reasons to think that we can improve on that record. In the first place, during the Cold War aid was more often a geopolitical tool than a well-considered economic strategy, so it's not surprising that much of the money was wasted. And we now understand that the kind of aid you give, and the policies of the countries you give it to, makes a real difference. A recent study by three scholars at the Center for Global Development found that, on average, foreign aid that was targeted at stimulating immediate economic growth (as opposed to, say, dealing with imminent crises) has had a significantly beneficial effect, even in Africa.

There's still a lot wrong with the way that foreign aid is administered. Too little attention is paid to figuring out which programs work and which don't, and aid still takes too little advantage of market mechanisms, which are essential to making improvements last. There's plenty we don't know about what makes one country succeed and another fail, and, as the former World Bank economist William Easterly points out, the foreign-aid establishment has often promised in the past that things would be different. So we should approach the problem of aid with humility. Yet humility is no excuse for paralysis. In 2002, President Bush created the Millennium Challenge Account, which is designed to target assistance to countries that adopt smart policies, and said that the U.S. would give five billion dollars in aid by 2006. Three years later, a grand total of 117,500 has been handed out. By all means, let's be tough-minded about aid. But let's not be hardheaded about it.

Source: James Surowiecki, "A Farewell to Alms?" New Yorker, July 25, 2005.

Some efforts are now being made to ensure more aid is directed toward countries with better institutional environments: the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation has pursued this goal, as has the World Bank. But past evidence is not encouraging: an exhaustive study of aid and growth by economists Raghuram Rajan and Arvind Subramanian concluded: "We find little robust evidence of a positive (or negative) relationship between aid inflows into a country and its economic growth. We also find no evidence that aid works better in better policy or geographical environments, or that certain forms of aid work better than others. Our findings suggest that for aid to be effective in the future, the aid apparatus will have to be rethought."22

# 4 Gains from Diversification of Risk

In the second section of this chapter, we studied consumption smoothing using a simplified model. We used a borrowing and lending approach, we considered a small open economy, we assumed that countries owned their own output, and we treated output shocks as given. We then saw how debt can be used to smooth the impact of output shocks on consumption. However, we also discussed the finding that in practice, countries seem to be unable to eliminate the effects of output volatility. The problems seem to be especially difficult in emerging markets and developing countries. We also saw that reliance on borrowing and lending may create problems because there may be limits to borrowing, risk premiums, and sudden stops in the availability of credit.


Are there other ways for a country to cope with shocks to output? Yes. In this final section, we show how diversification, another facet of financial globalization, can help smooth shocks by promoting risk sharing. With diversification, countries own not only the income stream from their own capital stock, but also income streams from capital stocks located in other countries. We see how, by using financial openness to trade such rights—for example, in the form of capital equity claims like stocks and shares—countries may be able to reduce the volatility of their incomes (and hence their consumption levels) without any net lending or borrowing whatsoever.

# Diversification: A Numerical Example and Generalization

To keep things simple and to permit us to focus on diversification, we assume there is no borrowing (the current account is zero at all times). To illustrate the gains from diversification, we examine the special case of a world with two countries, A and B, which are identical except that their respective outputs fluctuate asymmetrically, that is, they suffer equal and opposite shocks.

We now explore how this world economy performs in response to the output shocks. We examine the special case in which there are two possible "states of the world," which are assumed to occur with an equal probability of  $50\%$ . In terms of output levels, state 1 is a bad state for A and a good state for B; state 2 is a good state for A and a bad state for B.

We assume that all output is consumed, and that there is no investment or government spending. As we know from the previous chapter, output is distributed to factors in the form of income. We assume output is divided 60-40 between labor income and capital income in each country. The key question for us is who owns this income: domestic residents or foreigners?

Home Portfolios To begin, both countries are closed, and households in each country own the entire capital stock of their own country. Thus, A owns  $100\%$  of A's capital, and B owns  $100\%$  of B's capital. Under these assumptions, output (as measured by gross domestic product, GDP) is the same as income (as measured by gross national income, GNI) in A and B.

A numerical example is given in Table 17-6, panel (a). In state 1, A's output is 90, of which 54 units are payments to labor and 36 units are payments to capital; in state 2, A's output rises to 110, and factor payments rise to 66 for labor and 44 units for capital. The opposite is true in B: in state 1, B's output is higher than it is in state 2. Using our national accounting definitions, we know that in each closed economy, consumption  $C$ , income GNI, and output GDP are equal. In both A and B, all of these quantities are volatile. GNI, and hence consumption, flips randomly between 90 and 110 in both countries. The variation of GNI about its mean of 100 is plus or minus 10 in each country. Because households prefer smooth consumption, this variation is undesirable.

World Portfolios Notice that when one country's capital income is up, the other's is down. World GDP equals world GNI and is always 200. World labor income is always 120 and world capital income is always 80.

# TABLE 17-6

Portfolio Diversification Choices: Diversifiable Risks In countries A and B, GDP is allocated  $60\%$  to labor income and  $40\%$  to capital income. There are two "states of the world": state 1 is bad for A and good for B; state 2 is the opposite. On average, GDP equals 100, but in the good state, GDP is 110, and in the bad state it is only 90. Thus, world GDP and GNI always equal 200, world labor income is always 120, and world capital income is always 80. When each country holds only its own assets as in panel (a), GNI equals GDP and is very volatile. When each country holds a  $50\%$  share of the world portfolio as in panel (b), GNI volatility decreases because capital income is now smoothed. When each country holds a portfolio made up only of the other country's capital as in panel (c), GNI volatility falls even further by making capital income vary inversely with labor income.

It is apparent from Figure 17-9 that the two countries can achieve partial income smoothing if they diversify their portfolios of capital assets. For example, each country could own half of the domestic capital stock, and half of the other country's capital stock. Indeed, this is what standard portfolio theory says that investors should try to do. The results of this portfolio diversification are shown in Table 17-6, panel (b).

FIGURE 17-9
Capital income

# Portfolio Diversification and Capital Income: Diversifiable

Risks The figure shows fluctuations in capital income over time for different portfolios, based on the data in Table 17-6. Countries trade claims to capital income by trading capital assets. When countries hold the world portfolio, they each earn a 50-50 split (or average) of world capital income. World capital income is constant if shocks in the two countries are asymmetrical and cancel out. All capital income risk is then fully diversifiable.

Now each country owns one-half of its own capital stock but sells the other half to the other country in exchange for half of the other country's capital stock.[23] Each country's output or GDP is still as it was described in panel (a). But now country incomes or GNI can differ from their outputs or GDP. Owning  $50\%$  of the world portfolio means that each country has a capital income of 40 every period. However, labor income still varies between 54 and 66 in the bad and good states, so total income (and hence consumption) varies between 94 and 106. Thus, as Table 17-6, panel (b), shows, capital income for each country is smoothed at 40 units, the average of A and B capital income in panel (a), as also illustrated in Figure 17-9.

How does the balance of payments work when countries hold the world portfolio? Consider country A. In state 1 (bad for A, good for B), A's income or GNI exceeds A's output, GDP, by 4  $(94 - 90 = +4)$ . Where does the extra income come from? The extra is net factor income from abroad of  $+4$ . Why is it  $+4$ ? This is precisely equal to the difference between the income earned on A's external assets ( $50\%$  of B's payments to capital of  $44 = 22$ ) and the income paid on A's external liabilities ( $50\%$  of A's payments to capital of  $36 = 18$ ). What does A do with that net factor income? A runs a trade balance of  $-4$ , which means that A can consume 94, even when its output is only 90. Adding the trade balance of  $-4$  to net factor income from abroad of  $+4$  means that the current account is 0, and there is still no need for any net borrowing or lending, as assumed. These flows are reversed in state 2 (which is good for A, bad for B).

Note that after diversification, income or GNI varies in A and B by plus or minus 6 (around a mean of 100), which is less than the range of plus or minus 10 seen in Table 17-6, panel (a). This is because  $40\%$  of income is capital income and so  $40\%$  of the A income fluctuation of 10 can be smoothed by the portfolio diversification.

Generalizing Let us try to generalize the concept of capital income smoothing through diversification. Consider the volatility of capital income by itself, in the example we have just studied. Each country's payments to capital are volatile. A portfolio of  $100\%$  country A's capital or  $100\%$  of country B's capital has capital income that varies by plus or minus 4 (between 36 and 44). But a 50-50 mix of the two leaves the investor with a portfolio of minimum, zero volatility (it always pays 40).

This outcome is summed up in Figure 17-10, panel (a), which refers to either country, A or B. There is an identical high level of capital income volatility when the country holds either a  $100\%$  home portfolio or a  $100\%$  foreign portfolio. However, holding a mix of the two reduces capital income volatility, and a minimum volatility of zero can be achieved by holding the  $50 - 50\mathrm{mix}$  of the world capital income portfolio.

To generalize this result to the real world, we need to recognize that not all shocks are asymmetric as we have assumed here. The outputs of countries A and B may not be equal and opposite (with correlation  $-1$ ) as we have assumed here. In general, there will be some common shocks, which are identical shocks experienced by both countries. The impact of common shocks cannot be lessened or eliminated by any form of asset trade. For example, suppose we add an additional shock determined by two new states of the world, X and Y (these states of the world are independent of states of the world 1 and 2). We assume that in state X, the new shock adds five units to each

FIGURE 17-10

Return Correlations and Gains from Diversification The charts plot the volatility of capital income against the share of the portfolio devoted to foreign capital. The two countries are identical in size and experience shocks of similar amplitude. In panel (a), shocks are perfectly asymmetric (correlation  $= -1$ ), capital income in the two countries is perfectly negatively correlated. Risk can be eliminated by holding the world portfolio, and there are large gains from diversification. In panel (b), shocks are perfectly symmetric (correlation  $= +1$ ), capital income in the two countries is perfectly positively correlated. Risk cannot be reduced, and there are no gains from diversification. In panel (c), when both types of shock are present, the correlation is neither perfectly negative nor positive. Risk can be partially eliminated by holding the world portfolio, and there are still some gains from diversification.

(b) Symmetric Output Shocks: Perfect Positive Correlation  $(+1)$
(c) Other Cases: Combined Symmetric and Asymmetric Shocks country's output; in state Y, it subtracts five units from each. There is no way to avoid this shock by portfolio diversification. The X-Y shocks in each country are perfectly positively correlated (correlation +1). If this were the only shock, the countries' outputs would move up and down together and diversification would be pointless. This situation is shown in Figure 17-10, panel (b).


In the real world, any one country experiences some shocks that are correlated with those of other countries, either positively or negatively, and some that are uncorrelated. As long as some shocks are asymmetric, or country specific, and not common between the home and foreign country, then the two countries can take advantage of gains from the diversification of risk. In this more general case in which symmetric and asymmetric shocks are combined, as depicted in Figure 17-10, panel (c), holding a  $100\%$  portfolio of domestic (or foreign) assets generates a volatile income. But holding the 50-50 world portfolio will lower the volatility of income, albeit not all the way to zero (see the appendix at the end of the chapter for a detailed discussion).

Limits to Diversification: Capital Versus Labor Income As we saw in Table 17-6, panel (b), elimination of total income risk cannot be achieved by holding the world portfolio, even in the case of purely asymmetric shocks of capital assets. Why? Because labor income risk is not being shared. Admittedly, the same theory would apply if one could trade labor like an asset, but this is impossible because ownership rights to labor cannot be legally traded in the same way as one can trade capital or other property (that would be slavery).

Although it is true that labor income risk (and hence GDP risk) may not be diversifiable through the trading of claims to labor assets or GDP, this is not quite the end of our story—in theory at least. We saw in Table 17-6, panel (a), that capital and labor income in each country are perfectly correlated in this example: a good state raises both capital and labor income, and a bad state lowers both. This is not implausible—in reality, shocks to production do tend to raise and lower incomes of capital and labor simultaneously. This means that, as a risk-sharing device, trading claims to capital income can substitute for trading claims to labor income.

To illustrate this, imagine an unrealistic scenario in which the residents of each country own no capital stock in their own country but own the entire capital stock of the other country. As shown in Table 17-6, panel (c), owning only the other country's portfolio achieves more risk sharing than holding  $50\%$  of the world portfolio.

For example, when A is in the good state (state 2), A's labor income is 66 but A's capital income is 36 (assumed now to be  $100\%$  from B, which is in the bad state). This adds up to a portfolio of 102. In the bad state for A (state 2), A's labor income is 54, but A's capital income is 44 (from B, which is in a good state), for a total GNI of 98. So A's income (and consumption) vary by plus or minus 2, between 98 and 102 in panel (c). Compare this fluctuation of  $\pm 2$  around the mean of 100 to the fluctuations of  $\pm 10$  (home portfolio) and  $\pm 6$  (the world portfolio) in panels (a) and (b).

You can see how additional risk reduction has been achieved. A would like to own claims to  $50\%$  of B's total income. It could achieve this by owning  $50\%$  of B's capital and  $50\%$  of B's labor. But labor can't be owned, so A tries to get around the restriction of owning  $0\%$  of B's labor by acquiring much more than  $50\%$  of B's capital. Because labor's share of income in both countries is more than half in this example—a realistic ratio—this strategy allows for the elimination of some, but not all, risk.

# APPLICATION

# The Home Bias Puzzle

So much for theory. In practice, we do not observe countries owning foreign-biased portfolios or even the world portfolio. Countries tend to own portfolios that suffer from a strong home bias, a tendency of investors to devote a disproportionate fraction of their wealth to assets from their own home country, when a more globally diversified portfolio might protect them better from risk.

To illustrate this, economist Karen Lewis compared the risk and return for sample portfolios from which U.S. investors could have chosen for the period 1970 to 1996. She imagined an experiment in which some assets are allocated to a domestic portfolio (the S&P 500) and the remainder to an overseas portfolio (Morgan Stanley's EAFE fund). In this stylized problem, the question is what weight to put on each portfolio, when the weights must sum to  $100\%$ . In reality, U.S. investors picked a weight of about  $8\%$  on foreign assets. Was this a smart choice?

Figure 17-11 shows the risk and return for every possible weight between  $0\%$  and  $100\%$ . Return is measured by the mean rate of return (annualized percent per year); risk is measured by the standard deviation of the return (its root mean square deviation from its mean).

With regard to returns, the foreign portfolio had a slightly higher average return than the home portfolio during this period, so increasing the weight in the foreign

FIGURE 17-11

Portfolio Diversification in the United States The figure shows the return (mean of monthly return) and risk (standard deviation of monthly return) for a hypothetical portfolio made up from a mix of a pure home U.S. portfolio (the S&P 500) and a pure foreign portfolio (the Morgan Stanley EAFE) using data from the period 1970 to 1996. U.S. investors with a  $0\%$  weight on the overseas portfolio (point  $A$ ) could have raised that weight as high as  $39\%$  (point  $C$ ) and still raised the return and lowered risk. Even moving to the right of  $C$  (toward  $D$ ) would make sense, though how far would depend on how the investor viewed the risk-return trade-off. The actual weight seen was extremely low at just  $8\%$  (point  $B$ ) and was considered a puzzle.

portfolio would have increased the returns: the mean return line slopes up slightly from left to right. What about risk? A  $100\%$  foreign portfolio (point  $E$ ) would have generated higher risk than the home U.S. portfolio (point  $A$ ); thus,  $E$  is above  $A$ . However, we know that some mix of the two portfolios ought to produce a lower volatility than either extreme because the two returns are not perfectly correlated. This minimum volatility will not be zero because there are some undiversifiable, symmetric shocks, but it will be lower than the volatility of the  $100\%$  home and  $100\%$  foreign portfolios: overseas and domestic returns are not perfectly correlated, implying that substantial country-specific diversifiable risks exist.

In fact, Lewis showed that a U.S. investor with a  $0\%$  weight on the overseas portfolio (point  $A$ ) could have raised that weight to as much as  $39\%$  (point  $C$ ), while simultaneously raising the average of her total return and lowering its risk. Even moving to the right of  $C$  (toward  $D$ ) would make sense, though how far would depend on how the investor viewed the risk-return trade-off. Choosing a weight as low as  $8\%$  (point  $B$ ) would seem to be a puzzle.

Broadly speaking, economists have had one of two reactions to the emergence of the "home bias puzzle" in the 1990s. One is to propose many different theories to explain it away: Perhaps it is costly to acquire foreign assets, or get information about them? Perhaps there are asymmetries between home and foreign countries' consumption patterns (due to nontraded goods or trade frictions or even tastes) that make domestic assets a better hedge against domestic consumption risk? Perhaps home investors worry about regulatory barriers and the problems of corporate governance in foreign markets? These and many other solutions have been tried in extremely complex economic models, but none has been judged a complete success.

The other reaction of economists has been to look at the evidence of home bias in the period from the 1970s to the 1990s (the period of the Lewis study) as a legacy of the pronounced deglobalization of financial markets in the postwar period that might slowly disappear. Recent evidence suggests that this might be happening to some degree. There has been a dramatic increase in overseas equity investments in the last 40 years, with a very strong upward trend after 1985 in IMF data. For example, in the United States, the foreign share of the U.S. equity portfolio had risen to  $12\%$  by 2001 and  $28\%$  in 2010. Over the same period, the U.K. portfolio saw its foreign equity share rise from  $28\%$  to  $50\%$ . Figure 17-12 shows the massive extent of cross-border holdings of assets in today's global economy. Furthermore, these figures might understate the true extent to which residents have diversified away from home capital because many large multinational firms have capital income streams that flow from operations in many countries. For example, an American purchasing a share of Intel or Ford, or a Briton purchasing a share of BP, or a Japanese person purchasing a share of Sony, is really purchasing shares of income streams from the globally diversified operations of these companies. Technically, Intel is recorded in the data as a  $100\%$  U.S. "home" stock, but this makes the home bias puzzle look much worse than it really is because investors do seem to invest heavily in firms such as these that provide an indirect foreign exposure.[24]

Recent trends in diversification within portfolios and within companies may mean that even if the puzzle cannot be explained away, perhaps it will gradually go away.

# Summary: Don't Put All Your Eggs in One Basket

If countries were able to borrow and lend without limit or restrictions in an efficient global capital market, our discussions of consumption smoothing and efficient investment would seem to suggest that they should be able to cope quite well with the array of possible shocks, in order to smooth consumption. In reality, as the evidence shows, countries are not able to fully exploit the intertemporal borrowing mechanism.

In this environment, diversification of income risk through the international trading of assets can deliver substantial benefits. In theory, if countries were able to pool their income streams and take shares from that common pool of income, all country-specific shocks would be averaged out, leaving countries exposed only to common global shocks to income, the sole remaining undiversifiable shocks that cannot be avoided.

Financial openness allows countries—like households—to follow the old adage "Don't put all your eggs in one basket." The lesson here has a simple household analogy. Think of a self-employed person who owns a ski shop. If the only capital she owns is her own business capital, then her capital income and labor income move together, and go up in good times (winter) and down in bad times (summer). Her total income could be smoothed if she sold some stock in her company and used the proceeds to buy stock in another company that faced asymmetric shocks (a surf shop, perhaps).


In practice, however, risk sharing through asset trade is limited. For one thing, the number of assets is limited. The market for claims to capital income is incomplete because not all capital assets are traded (e.g., many firms are privately held and are not listed on stock markets), and trade in labor assets is legally prohibited. Moreover, even with the traded assets available, investors have shown very little inclination to invest their wealth outside their own country, although that may be slowly changing in an environment of ongoing financial globalization.

# 5 Conclusions

If a firm or household were to retreat from the national financial markets by keeping its money in a bag in a closet and paying cash for all its purchases (house, cars, appliances, toothpaste, gum, etc.), we would regard it as a strange and potentially costly move. By allowing households to save and borrow, financial markets help households smooth consumption in the face of shocks to their income (such as a debilitating illness, the loss of a job, destruction of property by floods or other acts of nature). Likewise, financial markets allow firms to borrow to invest efficiently in productive projects and permit investors to diversify their portfolios across a wide range of assets.

On the global scale, the same principles apply in theory to countries, subject to the long-run budget constraint. They, too, face income shocks, new investment opportunities, and country-specific risks. We have seen how they can similarly benefit from access to an external capital market—the global capital market.

Theory proves to be far from reality, however: the extent to which countries make use of global financial markets is still limited. Even in the most financially open advanced countries, consumption shocks remain, investment is often financed out of domestic saving, and a home bias persists in investors' portfolios. In poorer countries, we see no consumption smoothing gains realized, and there is little scope for development based on external finance until current low productivity levels are improved.

Are global capital markets failing? To the criticism that financial globalization doesn't work, one could respond that it hasn't really been fully tried yet. Many emerging markets and most developing countries are still on the road to full financial liberalization, and large barriers remain. Even so, deeper institutional weaknesses in these countries may hinder the efficient operation of the mechanisms we have studied. One could argue that such weaknesses may be corrected or diminished by the stimulus to competition, transparency, accountability, and stability that financial openness may provide.[25] But without further institutional improvements, the benefits of financial globalization are likely to be much smaller for these countries, and any benefits must be weighed against potential offsetting costs, such as the risk of crises, which we discuss in later chapters.

# KEY POINTS

1. Countries can use their external wealth as a buffer to smooth consumption in the face of fluctuations in output or investment. However, this process is not without its limits. The country must service its debts and must not allow debts to roll over and grow without limit at the real rate of interest.
2. The condition that guarantees that debts are serviced is the long-run budget constraint, or LRBC: the present value of future trade deficits must equal minus the present value of initial wealth.
3. The long-run budget constraint can be put another way: the present value of GDP plus the present value of initial wealth (the country's resources) must equal the present value of GNE (the country's spending).
4. In a closed economy, the country must satisfy  $TB = 0$  in every period as there is no external trade in goods or assets. In an open economy, the economy has to satisfy only the long-run budget constraint, which states that  $TB$  equals minus the present value of initial wealth. The former is a tighter constraint than the latter—implying that there can be gains from financial globalization.
5. The current account may be lower than normal in any period when there is unusually high private or public consumption (such as during a war), unusually low output (such as occurs after a natural disaster), or unusually high investment (such as that following a natural resource discovery).
6. If poor countries had the same productivity as rich countries, there would be substantial gains from investing in poor countries where the marginal product of capital, or MPK, would be much higher. However, this is not the case, and there is little evidence of investment inefficiency at the global level as measured by MPK gaps between countries. What gaps there are may be due to risk premiums. Consequently, large-scale investment (and foreign aid) in poor countries may not accelerate economic growth.


7. In addition to lending and borrowing, a country can reduce its risk by the international diversification of income claims. In practice, only capital income claims (capital assets) are tradable. Labor is not a tradable asset.
8. When assets are traded internationally, two countries can eliminate the income risk arising from country-specific or idiosyncratic shocks; such risk is called diversifiable risk. However, they can do nothing to eliminate the global risk, the shock common to both countries, called undiversifiable risk.
9. In practice, the use of the current account as a buffer and the extent of diversification fall far short of theory's prediction even in advanced countries. Consumption volatility persists, domestic investment is mostly financed from domestic saving, and portfolios display pronounced home bias.
10. In emerging markets and developing countries, financial openness has progressed more slowly and access to global capital markets is more limited and often on worse terms. The gains from financial openness appear weaker, and there is the downside risk of sudden stops and other crises. For gains to be realized, countries may require deeper institutional changes and further liberalization.

# PROBLEMS

1. Using the notation from the text, answer the following questions. You may assume that net labor income from abroad is zero, there are no capital gains on external wealth, and there are no unilateral transfers.

a. Express the change in external wealth  $(\Delta W_0)$  at the end of period 0 as a function of the economy's trade balance  $(TB)$ , the real interest rate (a constant  $r^*$ ), and initial external wealth  $(W_{-1})$ .
b. Using (a), write an expression for the stock of external wealth at the end of period 0  $(W_0)$ . This should be written as a function of the economy's trade balance  $(TB_0)$ , the real interest rate, and initial external wealth  $(W_{-1})$ .
c. Using (a) and (b), write an expression for the stock of external wealth at the end of period 1  $(W_{1})$ . This should be written as a function of the economy's trade balance  $(TB)$  each period, the real interest rate, and initial external wealth  $(W_{-1})$ .
d. Using your answers from (a), (b), and (c), write an expression for the stock of external wealth at the end of period 2  $(W_{2})$ . This should be written as a function of the economy's trade balance  $(TB)$  each period, the real interest rate, and initial external wealth  $(W_{-1})$ .
e. Suppose we require that  $W_{2}$  equal zero. Write down the condition that the three trade balances (in periods 0, 1, and 2) must satisfy. Arrange the terms in present value form.

2. Using the assumptions and answers from the previous question, complete the following: a. Write an expression for the future value of the stock of external wealth in period  $N(W_{N})$ . This should be written as a function of the economy's trade balance  $(TB)$  each period, the real interest rate  $r^{*}$ , and initial external wealth.

b. Using the answer from (a), write an expression for the present value of the stock of external wealth in period  $N(W_N)$ .
c. The "no Ponzi game" conditions force the present value of  $W_{N}$  to tend to zero as  $N$ gets large. Explain why this implies that the economy's initial external wealth is equal to the present value of future trade deficits.


d. How would the expressions in parts (a) and (b) change if the economy had net labor income (positive or negative) to/from abroad or net unilateral transfers? Explain briefly.

3. In this question, assume all dollar units are real dollars in billions, so, for example, $150 means $150 billion. It is year 0. Argentina thinks it can find $150 of domestic investment projects with an MPK of 10\% (each $1 invested pays off $0.10 in every later year). Argentina invests $84 in year 0 by borrowing 84 from the rest of the world at a world real interest rate r* of 5\%. There is no further borrowing or investment after this.

Use the standard assumptions: Assume initial external wealth  $W$  ( $W$  in year -1) is 0. Assume  $G = 0$  always; and assume  $I = 0$  except in year 0. Also, assume  $NUT = KA = 0$  and that there is no net labor income so  $NFIA = r^{*}W$ .

The projects start to pay off in year 1 and continue to pay off all years thereafter. Interest is paid in perpetuity, in year 1 and every year thereafter. In addition, assume that if the projects are not done, then  GDP = Q = C = \200  in all years, so that  PV(Q) = PV(C) = 200 + 200 / 0.05 = 4,200 .

a. Should Argentina fund the 84 worth of projects? Explain your answer.
b. Why might Argentina be able to borrow only $84 and not $150?
c. From this point forward, assume the projects totaling 84 are funded and completed in year 0. If the MPK is 10\%, what is the total payoff from the projects in future years?
d. Assume this is added to the $200 of GDP in all years starting in year 1. In dollars, what is Argentina's  $Q = GDP$  in year 0, year 1, and later years?
e. At year 0, what is the new  $PV(Q)$  in dollars? Hint: To ease computation, calculate the value of the increment in  $PV(Q)$  due to the extra output in later years.

f. At year 0, what is the new  $PV(I)$  in dollars? Therefore, what does the LRBC say is the new  $PV(C)$  in dollars?
g. Assume that Argentina is consumption smoothing. What is the percent change in  $PV(C)$ ? What is the new level of  $C$  in all years? Is Argentina better off?
h. For the year the projects go ahead, year 0, explain Argentina's balance of payments as follows: state the levels of CA, TB, NFIA, and FA.
i. What happens in later years? State the levels of CA, TB, NFLA, and FA in year 1 and every later year.

4. Continuing from the previous question, we now consider Argentina's external wealth position.

a. What is Argentina's external wealth  $W$  in year 0 and later? Suppose Argentina has a one-year debt (i.e., not a perpetual loan) that must be rolled over every year. After a few years, in year  $N$ , the world interest rate rises to  $15\%$ . Can Argentina stick to its original plan? What are the interest payments due on the debt if  $r^{*} = 15\%$ ? If  $I = G = 0$ , what must Argentina do to meet those payments?
b. Suppose Argentina decides to unilaterally default on its debt. Why might Argentina do this? State the levels of  $CA$ ,  $TB$ ,  $NFLA$ , and  $EA$  in year  $N$  and all subsequent years. What happens to the Argentine level of  $C$  in this case?
c. When the default occurs, what is the change in Argentina's external wealth  $W$ ? What happens to the rest of the world's external wealth?
d. External wealth data for Argentina and Rest of the World are recorded in the account known as the net international investment position. Is this change in wealth recorded as a financial flow, a price effect, or an exchange rate effect?

5. Using production function and MPK diagrams, answer the following questions. For simplicity, assume there are two countries: a poor country (with low living standards) and a rich country (with high living standards).

a. Assuming that poor and rich countries have the same production function, illustrate how the poor country will converge with the rich country. Describe how this mechanism works.
b. In the data, countries with low living standards have capital-to-worker ratios that are too high to be consistent with the model used in (a). Describe and illustrate how we can modify the model used in (a) to be consistent with the data.
c. Given your assumptions from (b), what does this suggest about the ability of poor countries to converge with rich countries? What do we expect to happen to the gap between rich and poor countries over time? Explain. Using the model from (b), explain and illustrate how convergence works in the following cases.
d. The poor country has a marginal product of capital that is higher than that of the rich country.
e. The marginal products in each country are equal. Then, the poor country experiences an increase in human capital through government funding of education.
f. The marginal products in each country are equal. Then, the poor country experiences political instability such that investors require a risk premium to invest in the poor country.

6. Assume that Brazil and the United States have different production functions  $q = f(k)$ , where  $q$  is output per worker and  $k$  is capital per worker. Let  $q = Ak^{1/3}$ . You are told that relative to the U.S. = 1, Brazil has an output per worker of 0.32 and capital per worker of 0.24. Can  $A$  be the same in Brazil as in the United States? If not, compute the level of  $A$  for Brazil. What is Brazil's MPK relative to the United States?

7. Use production function and MPK diagrams to examine Turkey and the EU. Assume that Turkey and the EU have different production functions  $q = f(k)$ , where  $q$  is output per worker and  $k$  is capital per worker. Let  $q = Ak^{1/3}$ . Assume that the productivity level  $A$  in Turkey is lower than that in the EU.

a. Draw a production function diagram (with output per worker  $y$  as a function of capital per worker  $k$  ) and MPK diagram (MPK versus  $k$  ) for the EU. (Hint: Be sure to draw the two diagrams with the production function directly above the MPK diagram so that the level of capital per worker  $k$  is consistent on your two diagrams.)


b. For now, assume capital cannot flow freely in and out of Turkey. On the same diagrams, plot Turkish production function and MPK curves, assuming that the productivity level  $A$  in Turkey is half the EU level and that Turkish MPK exceeds EU MPK. Label the EU position in each chart EU and the Turkish position  $T1$ .
c. Assume capital can now flow freely between Turkey and the EU and the rest of the world, and that the EU is already at the point where  $MPK = r^*$ . Label  $r^*$  on the vertical axis of the MPK diagram. Assume no risk premium. What will Turkey's capital per worker level  $k$  be? Label this outcome point  $T2$  in each diagram. Will Turkey converge to the EU level of  $q$ ? Explain.

8. This question continues from the previous problem, focusing on how risk premiums explain the gaps in living standards across countries.

a. Investors worry about the rule of law in Turkey and also about the potential for hyperinflation and other bad macroeconomic policies. Because of these worries, the initial gap between MPK in Turkey and  $r^*$  is a risk premium  $RP$ . Label  $RP$  on the vertical axis of the MPK diagram. Now where does Turkey end up in terms of  $k$  and  $q$ ?
b. In light of (a), why might Turkey be keen to join the EU?
c. Some EU countries are keen to exclude Turkey from the EU. What might be the economic arguments for that position?

9. In this chapter, we saw that financial market integration is necessary for countries to smooth consumption through borrowing and lending. Consider two economies: those of the Czech Republic and France. For each of the following shocks, explain how and to what extent each country can trade capital to better smooth consumption.

a. The Czech Republic and France each experience an EU-wide recession.
b. A strike in France leads to a reduction in French income.
c. Floods destroy a portion of the Czech capital stock, lowering Czech income.

10. Assume that a country produces an output  $Q$  of 50 every year. The world interest rate is  $10\%$ . Consumption  $C$  is 50 every year, and  $I = G = 0$ . There is an unexpected drop in output in year 0, so output falls to 39 and is then expected to return to 50 in every future year. If the country desires to smooth consumption, how much should it borrow in period 0? What will the new level of consumption be from then on?

11. Assume that a country produces an output  $Q$  of 50 every year. The world interest rate is  $10\%$ . Consumption  $C$  is 50 every year, and  $I = G = 0$ . There is an unexpected war in year 0, which costs 11 units and is predicted to last one year. If the country desires to smooth consumption, how much should it borrow in period 0? What will the new level of consumption be from then on?

The country wakes up in year 1 and discovers that the war is still going on and will eat up another 11 units of expenditure in year 1. If the country still desires to smooth consumption looking forward from year 1, how much should it borrow in period 1? What will the new level of consumption be from then on?

12. Consider a world of two countries: Highland (H) and Lowland (L). Each country has an average output of 9 and desires to smooth consumption. All income takes the form of capital income and is fully consumed each period.

a. Initially, there are two states of the world: Pestilence (P) and Flood (F). Each happens with  $50\%$  probability. Pestilence affects Highland and lowers the output there to 8, leaving Lowland unaffected with an output of 10. Flood affects Lowland and lowers the output there to 8, leaving Highland unaffected with an output of 10. Devise a table with two rows corresponding to each state (rows marked P and F). In three columns, show income to three portfolios: the portfolio of  $100\%$  H capital, the portfolio of

$100\%$  L capital, and the portfolio of  $50\%$  H  $+50\%$  L capital.

b. Two more states of world appear: Armageddon (A) and Utopia (U). Each happens with  $50\%$  probability but is uncorrelated with the P-F state. Armageddon affects both countries equally and lowers income in each country by a further four units, whatever the P-F state. Utopia leaves each country unaffected. Devise a table with four rows corresponding to each state (rows marked PA, PU, FA, and FU). In three columns, show income to three portfolios: the portfolio of  $100\%$  H capital, the portfolio of  $100\%$  L capital, and the portfolio of  $50\%$  H  $+50\%$  L capital.


Compare your answers to parts (a) and (b), and consider the optimal portfolio choices. Does diversification eliminate consumption risk in each case? Explain.

# NET WORK

1. Go the BEA website (bea.gov). Find the latest annual balance of payments data for the United States.

a. Compute income earned on (1) external assets and (2) income paid on external liabilities.

b. Find the latest net international investment position data for the United States. Compute (3) external assets and (4) external liabilities for the end of the prior year.

c. Divide (1) by (3) and then divide (2) by (4) to find the implied rates of interest on external assets and liabilities. Is the United States still privileged?

2. To learn more about the aid debate, download some of the conflicting arguments made by two prominent figures: Jeffrey Sachs and William Easterly (search: sachs easterly). See, for example, their "Foreign Aid Face Off" in the Los Angeles Times (latimes.com, April 30, 2006, and May 7, 2006). See also Nicholas Kristof, "Aid: Can It Work?" New York Review of Books, October 5, 2006. After weighing all these arguments, do you feel more or less optimistic about what aid can achieve?

# APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 17

# Common Versus Idiosyncratic Shocks

In reality, home and foreign incomes will not have a perfect inverse correlation as we have assumed in the text. Let us generalize a bit more for our two countries, and focus on capital income.

A More General Case Suppose the shocks to capital income are  $a$  and  $b$ , for countries A and B, respectively, and that these take a random value each period. The common shock is the average shock in the two countries:  $\frac{1}{2}(a + b)$ . In the chapter, we assumed the average shock was zero, so the shocks were equal and opposite. In the real world, however, this need not be the case.

We can define the A-specific shock as the shock  $a$  minus the average shock:  $a - \frac{1}{2} (a + b) = \frac{1}{2} (a - b)$ . Similarly, the B-specific shock is  $b$  minus the average shock:  $b - \frac{1}{2} (a + b) = \frac{1}{2} (b - a)$ . These idiosyncratic shocks are nonzero as long as the A shock is not the same as the B shock, that is, as long as  $a$  is not equal to  $b$ .

By doing this algebraic manipulation, the A shock can be written as the common shock plus the A-specific shock:

$$ a = \underbrace {\frac {1}{2} (a + b)} _ {\text {C o m m o n s h o c k}} + \underbrace {\frac {1}{2} (a - b)} _ {\text {A - s p e c i f i c s h o c k}}
$$

Similarly, the B shock can be written as the common shock plus the B-specific shock:

$$ b = \underbrace {\frac {1}{2} (a + b)} _ {\text {C o m m o n s h o c k}} + \underbrace {\frac {1}{2} (b - a)} _ {\text {B - s p e c i f i c s h o c k}}
$$

We see that the country-specific shocks are the exact opposites of each other:  $\frac{1}{2}(a - b)$  and  $\frac{1}{2}(b - a)$ . The good news is that country-specific shocks are a diversifiable risk and satisfy the conditions of the simple case examined in the chapter. So the income risk they generate can be eliminated by diversification: in the world portfolio, the country-specific shocks cancel out, as we can see by adding up the last two equations.

But the common shock is  $\frac{1}{2}(a + b)$ . As long as this is nonzero, these shocks matter, that is, as long as the shocks are not equal and opposite, pure asymmetric country-specific shocks. The bad news is, the global shocks are an undiversifiable risk—no matter which assets you own, you get hit with the global shock, so asset trade offers no escape from these risks.

Numerical Example Figure 17-A1 (an extension of Figure 17-9) provides an illustration of the partial reduction in risk that can be achieved in this case. In Figure 17-9, each country owned  $50\%$  of the world portfolio. Thus, capital incomes in each state were as follows: in state 1,  $\mathrm{A} = 36$ ,  $\mathrm{B} = 44$ ; in state 2,  $\mathrm{A} = 44$ ,  $\mathrm{B} = 36$ . The occurrence of states 1 and 2 was random with 50–50 odds. If A and B diversified by each holding  $50\%$  of the world portfolio, they had stable capital income of 40 every period.

In Figure 17-A1, we add an extra "global" shock, which has two states, X and Y, that occur at random with 50-50 odds. However, the random X-Y shock is independent

# Portfolio Diversification and Capital Income: Undiversifiable

Risks We take the example from Table 17-6 and Figure 17-9, and we add a common "global" shock to each country. With probability  $50\%$ , each country experiences a five-unit increase in capital income, and with probability  $50\%$  experiences a five-unit decrease in capital income. Holding half of the world portfolio reduces but does not eliminate capital income risk entirely because the global shock is an undiversifiable risk for the world as a whole.

of the 1-2 shock. We suppose that when the global shock is in state X, both countries receive an extra five units of capital income. When the global shock is in state Y, both countries receive five units less of capital income.

There are now four possible states of the world: 1X, 1Y, 2X, and 2Y. Each has a  $25\%$  chance of occurring. For the four states, the capital incomes of the portfolios are as follows:

1X Home  $= 41$  Foreign  $= 49$  World  $= 90$  Average  $= 45$

2X Home  $= 49$  Foreign  $= 41$  World  $= 90$  Average  $= 45$

1Y Home  $= 31$  Foreign  $= 39$  World  $= 70$  Average  $= 35$

2Y Home  $= 39$  Foreign  $= 31$  World  $= 70$  Average  $= 35$

From this table, and the example shown in Figure 17-A1, we see, as expected, that in this world, holding half of the world portfolio eliminates the risk associated with fluctuations between states 1 and 2. The best that each country can do is to have an income that fluctuates between 45 (half of 90, state X) and 35 (half of 70, state Y). In state X, all income risk associated with states 1 and 2 is gone. And in state Y, all income risk associated with states 1 and 2 is gone. But nothing can be done to eliminate the risk associated with fluctuations between states X and Y.

This more general result does not overturn our basic findings. Holding a  $100\%$  home portfolio generates a volatile capital income. So does holding a  $100\%$  foreign portfolio. Holding a mix of the two lowers the volatility of capital income, at least when some of the shocks are country-specific shocks, which is always the case in the real world.
