# Balance of Payments II: Output, Exchange Rates, and Macroeconomic Policies in the Short Run

If demand shifts from the products of country  $B$  to the products of country  $A$ , a depreciation by country  $B$  or an appreciation by country  $A$  would correct the external imbalance and also relieve unemployment in country  $B$  and restrain inflation in country  $A$ . This is the most favorable case for flexible exchange rates based on national currencies.

Robert Mundell, 1961

It is easy to understand the dislike... for a fixed exchange rate system which dictated that a slump must be aggravated by monetary reactions, although, doubtless, people had forgotten that the same system served to enhance booms.

Alec Ford, 1962

In the wake of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, exchange rates have been fluctuating a great deal, and not surprisingly they have once again risen to global prominence in economic, financial, and political debates. In late 2010, the Brazilian finance minister Guido Mantega seemed to invoke the ghosts of the 1930s when he spoke of a new "currency war" as the Brazilian real appreciated; in early 2013, the head of the Deutsche Bundesbank Jens Weidmann used the same term as the euro gained strength. Over the same postcrisis period, however, other central bankers, such as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke and the Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King, managed to display much less anxiety about their currency movements, as the values of the dollar and the pound slipped. Why were the Brazilian and the German economists so fretful? Why were their American and British counterparts so relaxed? Their attitudes reflect the idea that the exchange rate matters for the economy as a whole.

Thus far our study of exchange rates has been largely disconnected from real activity and the rest of the economy. Chapters 13 through 15 developed a theory of exchange rates, in which the economy's level of output was taken as given. To gain a more complete understanding of how an open economy works, we now extend our theory and explore what happens when exchange rates and output fluctuate in the short run. To do this, we build on the accounting framework we learned in the balance of payments chapter to understand how macroeconomic aggregates (including output, income, consumption, investment, and the trade balance) move together and in response to shocks in an open economy.

The model we study is an open-economy variant of the well-known IS-LM model that is widely used in the study of closed-economy macroeconomics. The key assumption of this type of Keynesian model is that prices are "sticky" in the short run so that output is determined by shifts in demand in the goods market. When we are finished, we will have a model that explains the relationships among all the major macroeconomic variables in an open economy in the short run.

Such a model can shed light on many policy issues. We can see how monetary and fiscal policies affect the economy, and discuss how they can be used to stabilize the economy and maintain full employment. One key lesson we learn in this chapter is that the feasibility and effectiveness of macroeconomic policies depend crucially on the type of exchange rate regime in operation.

# 1 Demand in the Open Economy

To understand macroeconomic fluctuations, we need to grasp how short-run disturbances affect three important markets in an economy: the goods market, the money market, and the foreign exchange (forex) market. In earlier chapters, we studied the forex market and the money market, so we will recap and apply here what we learned in those chapters. But what about the goods market? In the forex chapters, we assumed that output was fixed at a level  $\overline{Y}$ . We took this to be the full-employment level of output that would be expected to prevail in the long run, when all factor market prices have adjusted to ensure that all factors such as labor and capital are employed. But these assumptions about output and employment are valid only in the long run. To understand short-run fluctuations in economic activity, we now develop a short-run, sticky-price Keynesian model and show how fluctuations in demand can create fluctuations in real economic activity. To start building this model, we first make our assumptions clear and then look at how demand is defined and why it fluctuates.

# Preliminaries and Assumptions

Our interest in this chapter is to study short-run fluctuations in a simplified, abstract world of two countries. Our main focus is on the home economy. We use an asterisk to denote foreign variables when we need them. For our purposes, the foreign economy can be thought of as the rest of the world. The key assumptions we make are as follows:

Because we are examining the short run, we assume that home and foreign price levels,  $\overline{P}$  and  $\overline{P}^*$ , are fixed due to price stickiness. As a result of price stickiness, expected inflation is fixed at zero,  $\overline{\pi}^e = 0$ . If prices are fixed, all quantities can be viewed as both real and nominal quantities in the short run because there is no inflation.

- We assume that government spending  $\overline{G}$  and taxes  $\overline{T}$  are fixed at some constant levels, which are subject to policy change.
- We assume that conditions in the foreign economy such as foreign output  $\overline{Y}^*$  and the foreign interest rate  $\overline{i}^*$  are fixed and taken as given. Our main interest is in the equilibrium and fluctuations in the home economy.
- We assume that income  $Y$  is equivalent to output: that is, gross domestic product (GDP) equals gross national disposable income (GNDI). From our study of the national accounts, we know that the difference between the two equals net factor income from abroad plus net unilateral transfers. The analysis in this chapter could easily be extended to include these additional sources of income, but this added complexity would not offer any additional significant insights. We further assume that net factor income from abroad (NFIA) and net unilateral transfers (NUT) are zero, which implies that the current account (CA) equals the trade balance (TB); for the rest of this chapter, we shall just refer to the trade balance.

Our main objective is to understand how output (income) is determined in the home economy in the short run. As we learned from the national accounts, total expenditure or demand for home-produced goods and services is made up of four components: consumption, investment, government consumption, and the trade balance. In the following section, we see how each component is determined in the short run, and use the fact that demand must equal supply to characterize the economy's short-run equilibrium.

# Consumption

The simplest model of aggregate private consumption relates household consumption  $C$  to disposable income  $Y^{d}$ . As we learned in Chapter 16, disposable income is the level of total pretax income  $Y$  received by households minus the taxes paid by households  $\overline{T}$ , so that  $Y^{d} = Y - \overline{T}$ . Consumers tend to consume more as their disposable income rises, a relationship that can be represented by an increasing function, called the consumption function:

$$
\text{Consumption} = C = C(Y - \overline{T})
$$

A typical consumption function of this form is graphed in Figure 18-1; it slopes upward because consumption increases when disposable income increases.

This equation is known as the Keynesian consumption function. In some economic theories, consumption smoothing is both desirable and possible. That is, in any given year consumption need not depend on income in that year, but rather on total lifetime resources (wealth). In contrast, the Keynesian consumption function assumes

The Consumption Function The consumption function relates private consumption,  $C$ , to disposable income,  $Y - \overline{T}$ . The slope of the function is the marginal propensity to consume, MPC.

that private consumption expenditure is sensitive to changes in current income. This assumption seems to be a more reasonable match with reality in the short run: research shows that there is not very much consumption smoothing at the household or national level.

Marginal Effects The consumption function relates the level of consumption to the level of disposable income, but we are more often interested in the response of such variables to small changes in equilibrium, due to policy shocks or other shocks. For that purpose, the slope of the consumption function is called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), and it tells us how much of every extra  \$1 of disposable income received by households is spent on consumption. We generally assume that MPC is between 0 and 1: when consumers receive an extra unit of disposable income (whether it's a euro, dollar, or yen), they will consume only part of it and save the remainder. For example, if you spend $0.75 of every extra $1 of disposable income you receive, your MPC is 0.75. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is 1 - MPC. In this example, MPS = 0.25, meaning that \$0.25 of every extra 1 of disposable income is saved.

# Investment

The simplest model of aggregate investment makes two key assumptions: firms can choose from many possible investment projects, each of which earns a different real return; and a firm will invest capital in a project only if the real returns exceed the firm's cost of borrowing capital. The firm's borrowing cost is the expected real interest rate  $r^e$ , which equals the nominal interest rate  $i$  minus the expected rate of inflation  $\pi^e$ :  $r^e = i - \pi^e$ . It is important to note that, in general, the expected real interest rate depends not only on the nominal interest rate but also on expected inflation. However, under our simplifying assumption that expected inflation is zero, the expected real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate,  $r^e = i$ .

When the expected real interest rate in the economy falls, we expect more investment projects to be undertaken. For example, at a real interest rate of  $10\%$ , there may be only  $\$1$  billion worth of profitable investment projects that firms wish to undertake; but if the real interest rate falls to  $5\%$ , there may now be  $\$2$  billion worth of profitable projects. Hence, our model assumes that investment  $I$  is a decreasing function of the real interest rate; that is, investment falls as the real interest rate rises.

$$
\text{In ve st me nt} = I = I (i)
$$

Remember that this is true only because when expected inflation is zero, the real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate. Figure 18-2 shows a typical investment function of this type. It slopes downward because as the real interest rate falls, the quantity of investment rises.

# The Government

To develop a basic model of economic activity in the short run, we assume that the government's role is simple. It collects an amount  $T$  of taxes from private households and spends an amount  $G$  on government consumption of goods and services.

Note that the latter includes only actual spending on goods and services bought by the public sector at all levels. For example,  $G$  includes military equipment and personnel, transport and infrastructure, public universities and schools, and so forth. Excluded from this concept are the often huge sums involved in government transfer

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/867cafe6940b42ba5d916c485f0dbd55ca7d1a535f226812d45a26a2de560799.jpg)

FIGURE 18-2

The Investment Function The investment function relates the quantity of investment,  $I$ , to the level of the expected real interest rate, which equals the nominal interest rate,  $i$ , when (as assumed in this chapter) the expected rate of inflation,  $\pi^e$ , is zero. The investment function slopes downward: as the real cost of borrowing falls, more investment projects are profitable.

programs, such as social security, medical care, or unemployment benefit systems, that redistribute income between households. Such transfers are excluded because we assume that in the aggregate they do not generate any change in the total expenditure on goods and services; they merely change who gets to engage in the act of spending. (Transfers are like negative taxes and, as such, can be seen as a part of  $T$ .)

In the unlikely event that  $G = T$  exactly, government spending exactly equals taxes and we say that the government has a balanced budget. If  $T > G$ , the government is said to be running a budget surplus (of size  $T - G$ ); if  $G > T$ , a budget deficit (of size  $G - T$ ) or, equivalently, a negative surplus of  $T - G$ .

Fiscal policy is concerned with the levels of taxes  $T$  and spending  $G$  set by the government. In this chapter, we do not study in detail why or how governments make such policy choices; we make the simple assumption that in the short run the levels of taxes and spending are set exogenously at some fixed levels, denoted by an overbar:

$$
\text{Government purchases} = G = \bar {G}
$$

$$
\text{Taxes} = T = \overline {{T}}
$$

Policy makers may change these levels of taxes and spending at any time. We analyze the impact of such changes on the economy later in this chapter.

# The Trade Balance

In the balance of payments chapter, we saw from an accounting standpoint that the trade balance (equal to exports minus imports) measures the impact of foreign trade on the demand for domestic output. To develop a model, however, we need to know what drives these flows, so in our simple model we now explore three key determinants of the trade balance: the real exchange rate, the level of home income, and the level of foreign income.

The Role of the Real Exchange Rate What is the role of the real exchange rate? Recall George, the American tourist we met at the start of our study of exchange rates, who had to deal with a weaker dollar during his visits to Paris over the course of several years. If U.S. and French prices are sticky (constant in euro and U.S. dollar terms), then as the U.S. exchange rate depreciates, the prices of French goods and services became more and more expensive in dollar terms. In the end, George was ready to take a vacation in California instead. In the aggregate, when spending patterns change in response to changes in the real exchange rate, we say that there is expenditure switching from foreign purchases to domestic purchases.

Expenditure switching is a major factor in determining the level of a country's exports and imports. When learning about exchange rates in the long run, we saw that the real exchange rate is the price of goods and services in a foreign economy relative to the price of goods and services in the home economy. If Home's exchange rate is  $E$ , the Home price level is  $\overline{P}$  (fixed in the short run), and the Foreign price level is  $\overline{P}^*$  (also fixed in the short run), then the real exchange rate  $q$  of Home is defined as  $q = E\overline{P}^* / \overline{P}$ .

For example, suppose that the home country is the United States, and the reference basket costs \$100; suppose that in Canada the same basket costs C\$120 and the exchange rate is \$0.90 per Canadian dollar. In the expression q = E P * P, the numerator E P * is the price of foreign goods converted into home currency terms, \$108 = 120 × 0.90; the denominator P is the home currency price of home goods, \$100; the ratio of the two is the real exchange rate, q = \$108/100 = 1.08. This is the relative price of foreign goods in terms of home goods. In this case, Canadian goods are more expensive than U.S. goods.

A rise in the home real exchange rate (a real depreciation) signifies that foreign goods have become more expensive relative to home goods. As the real exchange rate rises, both home and foreign consumers will respond by expenditure switching: the home country will import less (as home consumers switch to buying home goods) and export more (as foreign consumers switch to buying home goods). These concepts are often seen in economic debates and news coverage (see Headlines: Oh! What a Lovely Currency War and Headlines: The Curry Trade) and they provide us with the following insight:

We expect the trade balance of the home country to be an increasing function of the home country's real exchange rate. That is, as the home country's real exchange rate rises (depreciates), it will export more and import less, and the trade balance rises.

The Role of Income Levels The other determinant of the trade balance we might wish to consider is the income level in each country. As we argued earlier in our discussion of the consumption function, when domestic disposable income increases, consumers tend to spend more on all forms of consumption, including consumption of foreign goods. These arguments provide a second insight:

We expect an increase in home income to be associated with an increase in home imports and a fall in the home country's trade balance.

Symmetrically, from the rest of the world's standpoint, an increase in rest of the world income ought to be associated with an increase in rest of the world spending on home goods, resulting in an increase in home exports. This is our third insight:

We expect an increase in rest of the world income to be associated with an increase in home exports and a rise in the home country's trade balance.

Combining the three insights above, we can write the trade balance as a function of three variables: the real exchange rate, home disposable income, and rest of the world disposable income:

$$
TB = TB(\underbrace{E\overline{P}^{*}/\overline{P}}_{\text{Increasing function}}, \underbrace{Y - \overline{T}}_{\text{Decreasing function}}, \underbrace{Y^{*} - \overline{T}^{*}}_{\text{Increasing function}})
$$

# HEADLINES

# Oh! What a Lovely Currency War

In September 2010, the finance minister of Brazil accused other countries of starting a "currency war" by pursuing policies that made Brazil's currency, the real, strengthen against its trading partners, thus harming the competitiveness of his country's exports and pushing Brazil's trade balance toward deficit. By 2013 fears about such policies were being expressed by more and more policymakers around the globe.

"Devaluing a currency," one senior Federal Reserve official once told me, "is like peeing in bed. It feels good at first, but pretty soon it becomes a real mess."

In recent times, foreign-exchange incontinence appears to have been the policy of choice in capitals from Beijing to Washington, via Tokyo. The resulting mess has led to warnings of a global "currency war" that could spiral into protectionism.

The roll call of forex Cassandras reads like a who's who of global finance and politics: German leader Angela Merkel, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and Mervyn King, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England. And the list goes on…

Currency wars have been a staple of modern finance ever since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in the early 1970s. As Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., says: "Most governments believe that their currencies are too important to be left to the markets." So policy makers have often tried to manipulate the value of their currencies by intervening in the markets.

In recent years, China stands out as the country that has done the most to keep its currency weak in order to boost exports. But it isn't alone. China's efforts have sparked what Fred Bergsten, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, calls "emulation and retaliation."

At their worst, these periodic crosscurrents of intervention have led to "beggarthy-neighbor" policies—self-defeating attempts to improve one country's economy at the expense of everybody else's… .

As developed countries like Japan and the U.S. try to kick-start their sluggish economies with ultralow interest rates and binges of money-printing, they are putting downward pressure on their currencies. The loose monetary policies are primarily aimed at stimulating domestic demand. But their effects spill over into the currency world.

Since the end of November, when it became clear that Shinzo Abe and his agenda of growth-at-all-costs would win Japan's elections, the yen has lost more than  $10\%$  against the dollar and some  $15\%$  against the euro.

These moves are angering export-driven countries such as Brazil and South Korea. But they also are stirring the pot in Europe. The euro zone has largely sat out this round of monetary stimulus and now finds itself in the invious position of having a contracting economy and a rising currency—making Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank a must-watch event.

The dirty secret is that using monetary policy to weaken a currency, whether voluntarily or not, is a shortcut to avoid unpopular decisions on fiscal and budgetary issues.

Breakdowns of the global foreign-exchange system have occurred with drastic regularity, but that doesn't mean this currency war will end in tears.

For a start, common sense could prevail, putting an end to the dangerous game of beggar (and blame) thy neighbor. After all, the International Monetary Fund was set up to prevent such races to the bottom, and should try to broker a truce among forex combatants.

If that sounds naive, consider the possibility that this huge bout of monetary stimulus will succeed in engendering a solid recovery driven by domestic demand. Or that fiscal policy will finally be put to work.

Either outcome would take away a big incentive for competitive devaluations and prompt governments to bolster their currencies to avoid stoking inflation.

Growth cures a lot of ills. Even forex incontinence.

Figure 18-3 shows the relationship between the trade balance and the real exchange rate for the home country, all else equal—that is, holding home and foreign disposable income fixed. The trade balance is an increasing function of the real exchange rate  $E\overline{P}^{*} / \overline{P}$ . Thus, the relationship shown in Figure 18-3 is upward sloping. The reason is that an increase in the real exchange rate (a real depreciation) increases  $TB$  by raising exports and lowering imports, implying a movement along the curve drawn.

# The Curry Trade

In 2009, a dramatic weakening of the pound against the euro sparked an unlikely boom in cross-Channel grocery deliveries.

If carrying coals to Newcastle is judged a pointless exercise, then importing croissants, baguettes and bottles of claret into France might seem even more absurd. But, due to the strength of the euro against the pound, hundreds of Britons living in France are now using the internet to order their food, including many French specialties, from British supermarkets.

Simon Goodenough, the director of Sterling Shopping, a delivery firm based in Brackley, Northamptonshire, says his company has 2,500 British customers in France and is running five delivery vans full of food to France each week.

"We deliver food from Waitrose, Sainsbury's and Marks and Spencer, but by far the biggest is Asda," said Goodenough "… We sit in our depot sometimes looking at the things people have bought and just laugh at the crazi ness of it all. We have seen croissants and baguettes in people's shopping bags. And we have delivered bottles of Bergerac wine bought from Sainsbury's to a customer in Bergerac. We even have a few French customers who have now heard about what we do. They love things like curries and tacos, which they just can't get in France." . .

Goodenough said many of his company's British customers hold pensions or savings in sterling rather than euros: "They have seen a  $30\%$  drop in their spending power over the past 18 months."

John Steventon owns La Maison Removals, a delivery company based in Rayleigh, Essex. It takes food from its warehouse to about 1,000 British customers in central France.

"We just can't cope with demand at the moment," he said… . "We found that friends in France were asking us to bring over British food for them so we just thought it made sense to set up a food delivery service… . The savings for buying food, in particular, are amazing due to the strength of the euro. Customers tell us that for every £100 they would spend in France buying food, they save £30 buying through us, even with our 15\% commission. A lot of people are using us to get things they really miss, such as bacon and sausages."

Nikki Bundy, 41, has lived near Périgueux in the Dordogne with her family for four years… . "It's just so much cheaper for us to buy our food this way… . The food in France is lovely, but you can come out of a supermarket here with just two carrier bags having spent €100. I still try and buy my fresh fruit and veg in France, but most other things I now buy from Asda."

FIGURE 18-3

The Trade Balance and the Real Exchange Rate The trade balance is an increasing function of the real exchange rate,  $E\bar{P}^{\prime} / \bar{P}$ . When there is a real depreciation (a rise in  $q$ ), foreign goods become more expensive relative to home goods, and we expect the trade balance to increase as exports rise and imports fall (a rise in  $TB$ ). The trade balance may also depend on income. If home income levels rise, then some of the increase in income may be spent on the consumption of imports. For example, if home income rises from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ , then the trade balance will decrease, whatever the level of the real exchange rate, and the trade balance function will shift down.

The effect of the real exchange rate on the trade balance is now clear. What about the effects of changes in output? Figure 18-3 also shows the impact of an increase in home output on the trade balance. At any level of the real exchange rate, an increase in home output leads to more spending on imports, lowering the trade balance. This change would be represented as a downward shift in the trade balance curve, that is, a reduction in  $TB$  for a given level of  $q = E\overline{P}^{*} / \overline{P}$ .

Marginal Effects Once More The impact of changes in output on the trade balance can also be thought of in terms of the marginal propensity to consume. Suppose home output (which equals home income, because of the assumptions we've made) rises by an amount  \Delta Y = \1  and that, all else equal, this leads to an increase in home imports of  \Delta IM = \MPC_F , where  MPC_F > 0 . We refer to  MPC_F  as the marginal propensity to consume foreign imports. For example, if  MPC_F = 0.1 , this means that out of every additional  \1  of income,  \$0.10  are spent on imports.

How does MPC_F relate to the MPC seen earlier? After a \$1 rise in income, any additional goods consumed have to come from somewhere, home or abroad. The fraction $MPC of the additional 1 spent on all consumption must equal the sum of the incremental spending on home goods plus incremental spending on foreign goods. Let MPC_H > 0 be the marginal propensity to consume home goods. By assumption, MPC = MPC_H + MPC_F. For example, if MPC_F = 0.10 and MPC_H = 0.65, then MPC = 0.75; for every extra dollar of disposable income, home consumers spend 75 cents—10 cents on imported foreign goods and 65 cents on home goods—and they save 25 cents.

# APPLICATION

# The Trade Balance and the Real Exchange Rate

Our theory assumes that the trade balance increases when the real exchange rate rises. Is there evidence to support this proposition? In Figure 18-4, we examine the evolution of the U.S. trade balance (as a share of GDP) in recent years as compared with the U.S. real exchange rate with the rest of the world.

By considering the home country to be the United States and the foreign "country" to be the rest of the world, we cannot use data on the bilateral real exchange rate  $q$  for any individual foreign country. We need a composite or weighted-average measure of the price of goods in all foreign countries relative to the price of U.S. goods. To accomplish this, economists construct multilateral measures of real exchange rate movement.

The most common weighting scheme uses a weight equal to that country's share in the home country's trade. If there are  $N$  foreign countries, we can write home's total trade as the sum of its trade with each foreign country:  $\text{Trade} = \text{Trade}_1 + \text{Trade}_2 + \dots + \text{Trade}_N$ . Applying a trade weight to each bilateral real exchange rate's percentage change, we obtain the percentage change in home's multilateral real exchange rate or real effective exchange rate:

$$
\frac{\Delta q_{\text{effective}}}{q_{\text{effective}}} = \underbrace {\left(\frac{\text{Trade}_{1}}{\text{Trade}} \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}}\right) + \left(\frac{\text{Trade}_{2}}{\text{Trade}} \frac{\Delta q_{2}}{q_{2}}\right) + \cdots + \left(\frac{\text{Trade}_{N}}{\text{Trade}} \frac{\Delta q_{N}}{q_{N}}\right)}_{\text{Realeffectiveexchangeratechange (in \%)}}
$$

FIGURE 18-4

The Real Exchange Rate and the Trade Balance: United States, 1975-2012 Does the real exchange rate affect the trade balance in the way we have assumed? The data show that the U.S. trade balance is correlated with the U.S. real effective exchange rate index. Because the trade balance also depends on changes in U.S. and rest of the world disposable income (and other factors), and because it may respond with a lag to changes in the real exchange rate, the correlation is not perfect (as seen in the years 2002-07 when the United States had a spending boom).

Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).

For example, if we trade  $40\%$  with country 1 and  $60\%$  with country 2, and we have a real appreciation of  $10\%$  against 1 but a real depreciation of  $30\%$  against 2, then the change in our real effective exchange rate is  $(40\% \times -10\%) + (60\% \times 30\%) = (0.4 \times -0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.3) = -0.04 + 0.18 = 0.14 = +14\%$ . That is, we have experienced an effective trade-weighted real depreciation of  $14\%$ .

Figure 18-4 shows that the U.S. multilateral real exchange rate and the U.S. trade balance have been mostly positively correlated, as predicted by our model. In periods when the United States has experienced a real depreciation, the U.S. trade balance has tended to increase. Conversely, real appreciations have usually been associated with a fall in the trade balance. However, the correlation between the real exchange rate and the trade balance is not perfect. There appears to be lag between, say, a real depreciation and a rise in the trade balance (as in the mid-1980s). Why? Import and export flows may react only slowly or weakly to changes in the real exchange rate, so the trade balance can react in unexpected ways (see Side Bar: Barriers to Expenditure Switching: Pass-Through and J Curve). We can also see that the trade balance and real exchange rate did not move together as much during the years 2000 to 2008 because other factors, such as tax cuts and wartime spending, may have created extra deficit pressures that spilled over into the U.S. current account during this period.

# Barriers to Expenditure Switching: Pass-Through and the J Curve

The basic analysis of expenditure switching in the text assumes two key mechanisms. First, we assume that a nominal depreciation causes a real depreciation and raises the price of foreign imports relative to home exports. Second, we assume that such a change in relative prices will lower imports, raise exports, and increase the trade balance. In reality, there are reasons why both mechanisms operate weakly or with a lag.

# Trade Dollarization, Distribution, and Pass-Through

One assumption we made was that prices are sticky in local currency. But what if some home goods prices are set in foreign currency?

For example, let the foreign country be the United States and suppose a share  $d$  of the home-produced basket of goods is priced in U.S. dollars at a sticky dollar price  $\overline{P}_1$ . Suppose that the remaining share,  $1 - d$ , is priced, as before, in local currency at a sticky local currency price  $\overline{P}_2$ . Hence,

$$
\left. \begin{array}{l} \text{Price of foreign goods} \\ \text{relative to dollar-priced} \\ \text{home goods} \end{array} \right\} = \frac{E \times \bar{P}^{*}}{E \times \bar{P}_{1}} = \frac{\bar{P}^{*}}{\bar{P}_{1}} \text{has a weight} = d
$$

$$
\left. \begin{array}{l} \text{Price of foreign goods} \\ \text{relative to local-currency-} \\ \text{priced home goods} \end{array} \right\} = \frac{E \times \bar{P}^{*}}{\bar{P}_{2}} \text{has a weight} = 1 - d
$$

In this setup, what is the price of all foreign-produced goods relative to all home-produced goods (the real exchange rate)? It is the weighted sum of the relative prices of the two parts of the basket. Hence, we find

$$ q = \text{Home real} \quad \text{exchange} \quad \text{rate} = d \frac{\bar{P}^{*}}{\bar{P}_{1}} + (1 - d) \frac{E \bar{P}^{*}}{\bar{P}_{2}}
$$

The first term with a weight  $d$  does not contain  $E$  because both numerator and denominator are dollar prices (already expressed in a common currency). Only the second term with a weight  $(1 - d)$  contains  $E$ , since the prices are in different currencies. Thus, a  $1\%$  increase in  $E$  will lead to only a  $(1 - d)\%$  increase in the real exchange rate.

When  $d$  is 0, all home goods are priced in local currency and we have our basic model. A  $1\%$  rise in  $E$  causes a  $1\%$  rise in  $q$ . There is full pass-through from changes in the nominal exchange rate to changes in the real exchange rate. But as  $d$  rises, pass-through falls. If  $d$  is 0.5, then a  $1\%$  rise in  $E$  causes just a  $0.5\%$  rise in  $q$ . The real exchange rate becomes less responsive to changes in the nominal exchange rate, and this means that expenditure switching effects will be muted.

It turns out that many countries around the world conduct a large fraction of their trade in a currency other than their own, such as U.S. dollars. The most obvious examples of goods with dollar prices are the major commodities: oil, copper, wheat, and so on. In some Persian Gulf economies, a nominal depreciation of the exchange rate does almost nothing to change the price of exports (more than  $90\%$  of which is oil priced in dollars) relative to the price of imports (again, overwhelmingly priced in dollars).

But dollar invoicing—and in Greater Europe, euro invoicing—extends around the world, as shown in Table 18-1. More than  $90\%$  of U.S. imports are priced in dollars: all else equal, a U.S. depreciation will hardly change the prices of these imports at

# TABLE 18-1

Trade Dollarization The table shows the extent to which the dollar and the euro were used in the invoicing of payments for exports and imports of different countries in the 2002-04 period. In the United States, for example,  $100\%$  of exports are invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars but so, too, are  $93\%$  of imports. In Asia, U.S. dollar invoicing is very common, accounting for  $48\%$  of Japanese exports and more than  $75\%$  of exports and imports in Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. In Europe the euro figures more prominently as the currency used for trade, but the U.S. dollar is still used in a sizable share of transactions.

Some Asian countries have trade flows that are  $70\%$  to  $90\%$  dollarized. Much of this is intra-Asian trade; if, say, a Korean supplier sells to a Japanese manufacturer, very often they conduct the trade not in yen or won, but entirely in U.S. dollars, which is the currency of neither the exporter nor the importer! The table also shows that many new EU member states in Eastern Europe have export shares largely denominated in euros.

Trade dollarization is not the only factor limiting pass-through in the real world. Even after an import has arrived at the port, it still has to pass through various intermediaries. The retail, wholesale, and other distribution activities all add a local currency cost or markup to the final price paid by the ultimate buyer. Suppose the markup is  \$100 on an import that costs\$ 100 at the port, so the good retails for \$200 in shops. Suppose a 10\% depreciation of the dollar raises the port price to \$110. All else equal, the retail price will rise to just 210, only a 5\% increase at the point of final sale. Thus, expenditure switching by final users will be muted by the limited pass-through from port prices to final prices.

How large are these effects? A study of 76 developed and developing countries found that, over the period of one year, a  $10\%$  exchange rate depreciation resulted in a  $6.5\%$  rise in imported goods prices at the port of arrival but perhaps only a  $4\%$  rise in the retail prices of imported goods.\*

# The J Curve

Our model of the trade balance assumes that a real depreciation improves a country's trade balance by increasing exports and reducing imports. In reality, however, these effects may be slow to appear because orders for export and import goods are placed months in advance. Thus, at the moment of depreciation there will be no instantaneous change in export and import volumes.

What does this slow adjustment imply? Exports will continue to sell for a time in the same quantity and at the same domestic price, and so total export earnings remain fixed. What will change is the domestic price paid for the import goods. They will have become more expensive in domestic currency terms. If the same quantity of imports flows in but costs more per unit, then the home country's total import bill will rise.

As a result, if export earnings are fixed but import expenditures are rising, the trade balance will initially fall rather than rise, as shown in Figure 18-5. Only after time passes, and export and import orders adjust to the new relative prices, will the trade balance move in the positive direction we have assumed. Because of its distinctive shape, the curve traced out by the trade balance over time in Figure 18-5 is called the J Curve. Some empirical studies find that the effects of the J Curve last up to a year after the initial depreciation. Hence, the assumption that a depreciation boosts spending on the home country's goods may not hold in the very short run.

The J Curve When prices are sticky and there is a nominal and real depreciation of the home currency, it may take time for the trade balance to move toward surplus. In fact, the initial impact may be toward deficit. If firms and households place orders in advance, then import and export quantities may react sluggishly to changes in the relative price of home and foreign goods. Hence, just after the depreciation, the value of home exports,  $EX$ , will be unchanged. However, home imports now cost more due to the depreciation. Thus, the value of imports,  $IM$ , would actually rise after a depreciation, causing the trade balance  $TB = EX - IM$  to fall. Only after some time would exports rise and imports fall, allowing the trade balance to rise relative to its predepreciation level. The path traced by the trade balance during this process looks vaguely like a letter J.

# Exogenous Changes in Demand

We have already treated as given, or exogenous, the changes or shocks in demand that originate in changes to government purchases or taxes. However, other exogenous changes in demand can affect consumption, investment, or the trade balance, and it is important to know how to analyze these, too. Examples of such changes are illustrated in Figure 18-6.

An exogenous change in consumption. Suppose that at any given level of disposable income, consumers decide to spend more on consumption. After this shock, the consumption function would shift up as in Figure 18-6, panel (a). For example, an increase in household wealth following a stock market or housing market

Exogenous Shocks to Consumption, Investment, and the Trade Balance (a) When households decide to consume more at any given level of disposable income, the consumption function shifts up. (b) When firms decide to invest more at any given level of the interest rate, the investment function shifts right. (c) When the trade balance increases at any given level of the real exchange rate, the trade balance function shifts up.

boom (as seen in expansions since 1990) could lead to a shift of this sort. This is a change in consumption demand unconnected to disposable income.

An exogenous change in investment. Suppose that at any given level of the interest rate, firms decide to invest more. After this shock, the investment function would shift up as in Figure 18-6, panel (b). For example, a belief that high-technology companies had great prospects for success led to a large surge in investment in this sector in many countries in the 1990s. This is a change in investment demand unconnected to the interest rate.

An exogenous change in the trade balance. Suppose that at any given level of the real exchange rate, export demand rises and/or import demand falls. After one of these shocks, trade balance function would shift up as in Figure 18-6, panel (c). Such a change happened in the 1980s when U.S. consumers' tastes shifted away from the large domestic automobiles made in Detroit toward smaller fuel-efficient imported cars manufactured in Japan. This is a switch in demand away from U.S. and toward Japanese products unconnected with the real exchange rate.

# 2 Goods Market Equilibrium: The Keynesian Cross

We have now studied the determinants of each component of demand. We next put all the components together and show that the goods market is in equilibrium when total demand from all these components is equal to total supply.

# Supply and Demand

The total aggregate supply of final goods and services is equal to total national output measured by GDP. Given our assumption that the current account equals the trade balance, gross national income  $Y$  equals GDP:

$$
\text{Supply} = GDP = Y
$$

Aggregate demand, or just "demand," consists of all the possible sources of demand for this supply of output. In the balance of payments chapter, we studied the expenditure side of the national income accounts and saw that supply is absorbed into different uses according to the national income identity. This accounting identity always holds true. But an identity is not an economic model. A model must explain how, in equilibrium, the observed demands take on their desired or planned values and still satisfy the accounting identity. How can we construct such a model?

We may write total demand for GDP as

$$
\text{Demand} = D = C + I + G + TB
$$

We can substitute the formulae for consumption, investment, and the trade balance presented in the first section of this chapter into this total demand equation to obtain

$$
D = C (Y - \bar {T}) + I (i) + \bar {G} + T B (E \bar {P}^{*} / \bar {P}, Y - \bar {T}, Y^{*} - \bar {T}^{*})
$$

Finally, in an equilibrium, demand  $D$  must equal supply  $Y$ , so from the preceding two equations we can see that the goods market equilibrium condition is

$$
Y = \underbrace {C (Y - \bar {T}) + I (i) + \bar {G} + T B \left(E \bar {P}^{*} / \bar {P} , Y - \bar {T} , Y^{*} - \bar {T}^{*}\right)}_{D} \tag {18-1}
$$

# Determinants of Demand

The right-hand side of Equation (18-1) shows that many factors can affect demand: home and foreign output ( $Y$  and  $Y^{*}$ ), home and foreign taxes ( $T$  and  $T^{*}$ ), the home nominal interest rate ( $i$ ), government spending ( $\overline{G}$ ), and the real exchange rate  $(E\overline{P}^{*} / \overline{P})$ . Let us examine each of these in turn. We start with home output  $Y$ , and assume that all other factors remain fixed.

A rise in output Y (all else equal) will cause the right-hand side to increase. For example, suppose output increases by ΔY = \$1. This change causes consumption spending C to increase by +$MPC. The change in imports will be +$MPCF, causing the trade balance to change by -$MPCF. So the total change in D will be $(MPC - MPCF) = $MPCH > 0, a positive number. This is an intuitive result: an extra \$1 of output generates some spending on home goods (an amount $MPCH), with the remainder either spent on foreign goods (an amount $MPCF) or saved (an amount $MPS).

Using this result, Figure 18-7, panel (a), plots demand  $D$ , the right-hand side of Equation (18-1), as a function of income or output  $Y$  only. For the moment, we hold fixed all other determinants of  $D$ . Because  $D$  increases as  $Y$  increases, the demand function has a positive slope  $MPC_{H}$ , a number between 0 and 1.

Also drawn is the 45-degree line, which represents  $Y$ , the left-hand side of Equation (18-1). The 45-degree line has a slope of 1, so it is steeper than the demand function.

This diagram is often called the Keynesian cross. It depicts the goods market equilibrium: the goods market is in equilibrium at point 1 where the two lines intersect, for that is the unique point where  $D = Y$ . This corresponds to an income or output level of  $Y_{1}$ .

Why does the goods market adjust to an equilibrium at this point? To the right of point 1, output tends to fall; to the left of point 1, output tends to rise. Why? At point 2, the output level is  $Y_{2}$  and demand  $D$  exceeds supply  $Y$ ; as inventories fall, firms expand production and output rises toward  $Y_{1}$ . At point 3, the output level is  $Y_{3}$  and supply  $Y$  exceeds demand; as inventories rise, firms cut production and output falls toward  $Y_{1}$ . Only at point 1 are firms in an equilibrium in which production levels are stable in the short run.

Note the crucial assumptions in this model are that prices are fixed and firms are willing to adjust their production and employment to meet whatever the desired level of demand happens to be. These assumptions may be realistic in the short run, but they do not apply in the long run, when prices can adjust and output and employment are determined by the economy's ability to fully employ its technology and resources.

# Factors That Shift the Demand Curve

The Keynesian cross also allows us to examine the impact of the other factors in Equation (18-1) on goods market equilibrium. Let's look at four important cases:

- A change in government spending. An exogenous rise in government purchases  $\overline{G}$  (all else equal) increases demand at every level of output, as seen in Equation (18-1). More government purchases directly add to the total demand in the economy. This change causes an upward shift in the demand function  $D$ , as in Figure 18-7, panel (b). Goods market equilibrium shifts from point 1 to point 2, to an output level  $Y_{2}$ .

# FIGURE 18-7

# Panel (a): The Goods Market Equilibrium and the Keynesian Cross

Equilibrium is where demand,  $D$ , equals real output or income,  $Y$ . In this diagram, equilibrium is a point 1, at an income or output level of  $Y_{1}$ . The goods market will adjust toward this equilibrium. At point 2, the output level is  $Y_{2}$  and demand,  $D$ , exceeds supply,  $Y$ ; as inventories fall, firms expand production and output rises toward  $Y_{1}$ . At point 3, the output level is  $Y_{3}$  and supply  $Y$  exceeds demand; as inventories rise, firms cut production and output falls toward  $Y_{1}$ .

# Panel (b): Shifts in

Demand The goods market is initially in equilibrium at point 1, at which demand and supply both equal  $Y_{1}$ . An increase in demand,  $D$ , at all levels of real output,  $Y$ , shifts the demand curve up from  $D_{1}$  to  $D_{2}$ . Equilibrium shifts to point 2, where demand and supply are higher and both equal  $Y_{2}$ . Such an increase in demand could result from changes in one or more of the components of demand:  $C$ ,  $I$ ,  $G$ , or  $TB$ .

The lesson: any exogenous change in  $G$  (due to changes in the government budget) will cause the demand curve to shift.

- A change in taxes (or other factors affecting consumption). A fall in taxes  $\overline{T}$  (all else equal) increases disposable income. When consumers have more disposable income, they spend more on consumption. This change raises demand at every level of output  $Y$ , because  $C$  increases as disposable income increases. This is seen in Equation (18-1) and in Figure 18-7, panel (a). Thus, a fall in taxes shifts the demand function upward from  $D_{1}$  to  $D_{2}$ , as shown again in Figure 18-7, panel (b). The increase in  $D$  causes the goods market equilibrium to shift from point 1 to point 2, and output rises to  $Y_{2}$ .

The lesson: any exogenous change in  $C$  (due to changes in taxes, tastes, etc.) will cause the demand curve to shift.

- A change in the home interest rate (or other factors affecting investment). A fall in the interest rate  $i$  (all else equal) will lead to an increase in  $I$ , as firms find it profitable to engage in more investment projects, and spend more. This change leads to an increase in demand  $D$  at every level of output  $Y$ . The demand function  $D$  shifts upward, as seen in Figure 18-7, panel (b). The increase in demand causes the goods market equilibrium to shift from point 1 to point 2, and output rises to  $Y_{2}$ .

The lesson: any exogenous change in  $I$  (due to changes in interest rates, the expected profitability of investment, changes in tax policy, etc.) will cause the demand curve to shift.

- A change in the home exchange rate. A rise in the nominal exchange rate  $E$  (all else equal) implies a rise in the real exchange rate  $EP^{*} / P$  (due to sticky prices). This is a real depreciation, and through its effects on the trade balance  $TB$  via expenditure switching, it will increase demand  $D$  at any given level of home output  $Y$ . For example, spending switches from foreign goods to American goods when the U.S. dollar depreciates. This change causes the demand function  $D$  to shift up, as seen yet again in Figure 18-7, panel (b).

The lesson: any change in the exchange rate will cause the demand curve to shift.

- A change in the home or foreign price level. If prices are flexible, then a rise in foreign prices or a fall in domestic prices causes a home real depreciation, raising  $q = \overline{E\bar{P}^* / \bar{P}}$ . This real depreciation causes TB to rise and, all else equal, it will increase demand D at any given level of home output Y. For example, spending switches from foreign goods to American goods when the U.S. prices fall. This change causes the demand function D to shift up, as seen yet again in Figure 18-7, panel (b).

The lesson: any change in  $P^*$  or  $P$  will cause the demand curve to shift.

# Summary

An increase in output  $Y$  causes a move along the demand curve (and similarly for a decrease). But any increase in demand that is not due to a change in output  $Y$  will instead cause the demand curve itself to shift upward in the Keynesian cross diagram, as in Figure 18-7, panel (b). Similarly, any contraction in demand not due to output changes will cause the demand function to shift downward.

To conclude, the main factors that shift the demand curve out are as follows:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/d62b951747e0445ba11dcbbb2c42d2912bdc6cf6042d93fe0eaf8cbc5a888f08.jpg)

The opposite changes lead to a decrease in demand and shift the demand curve in.

# 3 Goods and Forex Market Equilibria: Deriving the IS Curve

We have made an important first step in our study of the short-run behavior of exchange rates and output. Our analysis of demand shows how the level of output adjusts to ensure a goods market equilibrium, given the levels of each component of demand. Each component, in turn, has its own particular determinants, and we have examined how shifts in these determinants (or in other exogenous factors) might shift the level of demand and, hence, change the equilibrium level of output.

But there is more than one market in the economy, and a general equilibrium requires equilibrium in all markets—that is, equilibrium in the goods market, the money market, and the forex market. We need to bring all three markets into the analysis, and we do that next by developing a tool of macroeconomic analysis known as the IS-LM diagram. A version of this may be familiar to you from the study of closed-economy macroeconomics, but in this chapter we develop a variant of this approach for an open economy.

Analyzing equilibria in three markets simultaneously is a difficult task, but it is made more manageable by proceeding one step at a time using familiar tools. Our first step builds on the Keynesian cross depiction of goods market equilibrium developed in the last section and then adds on the depiction of forex market equilibrium that we developed in the earlier exchange rate chapters.

# Equilibrium in Two Markets

We begin by defining the IS curve, which is one part of the IS-LM diagram.

The IS curve shows combinations of output  $Y$  and the interest rate  $i$  for which the goods and forex markets are in equilibrium.

In Figure 18-8, panel (b), we derive the IS curve by using the Keynesian cross in panel (a) to analyze goods market equilibrium. In panel (c), we impose the uncovered interest parity relationship that ensures the forex market is in equilibrium.

Before we continue, let's take a closer look at why the various graphs in this figure are oriented as they are. The Keynesian cross in panel (a) and the IS diagram in panel (b) share a common horizontal axis, the level of output or income. Hence, these figures are arranged one above the other so that these common output axes line up.

The forex market in panel (c) and the IS diagram in panel (b) share a common vertical axis, the level of the domestic interest rate. Hence, these figures are arranged side by side so that these common interest rate axes line up.

We thus know that if output  $Y$  is at a level consistent with demand equals supply, shown in the Keynesian cross in panel (a), and if the interest rate  $i$  is at a level consistent with uncovered interest parity, shown in the forex market in panel (c), then in panel (b), then we must have a combination of  $Y$  and  $i$  that is consistent with equilibrium in both goods and forex markets.

# Forex Market Recap

In earlier chapters we learned that the forex market is in equilibrium when the expected returns expressed in domestic currency are the same on foreign and domestic interest-bearing (money market) bank deposits. Equation (15-1) described this condition, known as uncovered interest parity (UIP), where home and foreign

(c) FX Market

Deriving the IS Curve The Keynesian cross is in panel (a), IS curve in panel (b), and forex (FX) market in panel (c). The economy starts in equilibrium with output,  $Y_{1}$ ; interest rate,  $i_{1}$ ; and exchange rate,  $E_{1}$ . Consider the effect of a decrease in the interest rate from  $i_{1}$  to  $i_{2}$ , all else equal. In panel (c), a lower interest rate causes a depreciation; equilibrium moves from  $1'$  to  $2'$ . A lower interest rate boosts investment and a depreciation boosts the trade balance. In panel (a), demand shifts up from  $D_{1}$  to  $D_{2}$ , equilibrium from  $1''$  to  $2''$ , output from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ . In panel (b), we go from point 1 to point 2. The IS curve is thus traced out, a downward-sloping relationship between the interest rate and output. When the interest rate falls from  $i_{1}$  to  $i_{2}$ , output rises from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ . The IS curve describes all combinations of  $i$  and  $Y$  consistent with goods and FX market equilibria in panels (a) and (c).

currencies corresponded to the dollar and the euro; for any currency pair we can write, similarly:

The expected return on the foreign deposit measured in home currency equals the foreign interest rate plus the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency.

Taking the foreign interest rate  $i^{*}$  and expectations of the future exchange rate  $E^{e}$  as given, we know that the right-hand side of this expression decreases as  $E$  increases: the intuition for this is that the more expensive it is to purchase foreign currency today, the lower the expected return must be, all else equal.

The inverse relationship between  $E$  and the expected foreign return on the right-hand side of the previous equation is shown by the downward-sloping  $FR$  (foreign returns) line in panel (c) of Figure 18-8. The domestic return  $DR$  is the horizontal line corresponding to the level of the domestic interest rate  $i$ .

# Deriving the IS Curve

Using the setup in Figure 18-8, we can now derive the shape of the IS curve by considering how changes in the interest rate affect output if the goods and forex markets are to remain in equilibrium.

Initial Equilibrium Let us suppose that the goods market and forex markets are initially in equilibrium at an interest rate  $i_1$ , an output or income level  $Y_1$ , and an exchange rate  $E_1$ .

In panel (a) by assumption, at an output level  $Y_{1}$ , demand equals supply, so the output level  $Y_{1}$  must correspond to the point  $1^{\prime \prime}$ , which is at the intersection of the Keynesian cross, and the figure is drawn accordingly.

In panel (c) by assumption, at an interest rate  $i_1$  and an exchange rate  $E_1$ , the domestic and foreign returns must be equal, so this must be the point  $1'$ , which is at the intersection of the  $DR_1$  and  $FR$  curves, and the figure is drawn accordingly.

Finally, in panel (b) by assumption, at an interest rate  $i_1$  and an output level  $Y_1$ , both goods and forex markets are in equilibrium. Thus, the point 1 is on the IS curve, by definition.

Lines are drawn joining the equal output levels  $Y_{1}$  in panels (a) and (b). The domestic return line  $DR_{1}$  traces out the home interest rate level from panel (b) across to panel (c).

A Fall in the Interest Rate Now in Figure 18-8, let us suppose that the home interest rate falls from  $i_1$  to  $i_2$ . What happens to equilibria in the good and forex markets?

We first look at the forex market in panel (c). From our analysis of UIP in earlier chapters we know that when the home interest rate falls, domestic deposits have a lower return and look less attractive to investors. To maintain forex market equilibrium, the exchange rate must rise (the home currency must depreciate) until domestic and foreign returns are once again equal. In our example, when the home interest rate falls to  $i_2$ , the exchange rate must rise from  $E_1$  to  $E_2$  to equalize  $FR$  and  $DR_2$  and restore equilibrium in the forex market at point  $2'$ .

How do the changes in the home interest rate and the exchange rate affect demand? As shown in panel (a), demand will increase (shift up) for two reasons, as we learned earlier in this chapter.

First, when the domestic interest rate falls, firms are willing to engage in more investment projects, and their increased investment augments demand. The increase in investment, all else equal, directly increases demand  $D$  at any level of output  $Y$ .

Second, the exchange rate  $E$  has risen (depreciated). Because prices are sticky in the short run, this rise in the nominal exchange rate  $E$  also causes a rise in the real exchange rate  $E\overline{P}^{*} / \overline{P}$ . That is, the nominal depreciation causes a real depreciation. This increases demand  $D$  via expenditure switching. At any level of output  $Y$  consumers switch expenditure from relatively more expensive foreign goods toward relatively less expensive domestic goods. Thus, the fall in the interest rate indirectly boosts demand via exchange rate effects felt through the trade balance  $TB$ .

One important observation is in order: in an open economy, the phenomenon of expenditure switching operates as an additional element in demand that is not present in a closed economy. In an open economy, lower interest rates stimulate demand through the traditional closed-economy investment channel and through the trade balance. The trade balance effect occurs because lower interest rates cause a nominal depreciation, which in the short run is also a real depreciation, which stimulates external demand via the trade balance.

To summarize, panel (a) shows clearly that in response to a decrease in the interest rate, demand has shifted up to  $D_{2}$  and the Keynesian cross goods market equilibrium is restored by a rise in output to  $Y_{2}$ , which corresponds to point  $2^{\prime \prime}$ .

In panel (b), we can now derive the shape of the IS curve. At an interest rate  $i_1$  and output level  $Y_1$  and at an interest rate  $i_2$  and an output level  $Y_2$ , both the goods and forex markets are in equilibrium. We have now derived the shape of the IS curve, which describes goods and forex market equilibrium. When the interest rate falls from  $i_1$  to  $i_2$ , output rises from  $Y_1$  to  $Y_2$ . The IS curve is downward sloping, which illustrates the negative relationship between the interest rate  $i$  and output  $Y$ .

# Factors That Shift the IS Curve

In deriving the IS curve, we treated various demand factors as exogenous, including fiscal policy, price levels, and the exchange rate. If any factors other than the interest rate and output change, the position of the IS curve would have to change. These effects are central in any analysis of changes in an economy's equilibrium. We now explore several changes that result in an increase in demand, that is, an upward shift in the demand curve in Figure 18-9, panel (a). (A decrease in demand would result from changes in the opposite direction.)

- A change in government spending. If demand shifts up because of a rise in  $\overline{G}$ , a fiscal expansion, all else equal, what happens to the IS curve? The initial equilibrium point  $(Y_{1}, i_{1})$  would no longer be a goods market equilibrium: if the interest rate is unchanged at  $i_{1}$ , then  $I$  is unchanged, as are the exchange rate  $E$  and hence  $TB$ . Yet demand has risen due to the change in  $G$ . That demand has to be satisfied somehow, so more output has to be produced. Some—but not all—of that extra output will be consumed, but the rest can meet the extra demand generated by the rise in government spending. At the interest rate  $i_{1}$ , output must rise to  $Y_{2}$  for the goods market to once again be in equilibrium. Thus, the IS curve must shift right as shown in Figure 18-9, panel (b).

The lesson: a rise in government spending shifts the IS curve out.

- A change in taxes. Suppose taxes were to decrease. With all other factors remaining unchanged, this tax cut makes demand shift up by boosting private consumption, all else equal. We assume that the interest rate  $i_1$ , the exchange rate  $E_1$ , and government's spending policy are all fixed. Thus, neither  $I$  nor  $TB$  nor  $G$  change. With an excess of demand, supply has to rise, so output must again increase to  $Y_2$  and the IS curve shifts right.

Exogenous Shifts in Demand Cause the IS Curve to Shift In the Keynesian cross in panel (a), when the interest rate is held constant at  $i_1$ , an exogenous increase in demand (due to other factors) causes the demand curve to shift up from  $D_1$  to  $D_2$  as shown, all else equal. This moves the equilibrium from  $1''$  to  $2''$ , raising output from  $Y_1$  to  $Y_2$ . In the IS diagram in panel (b), output has risen, with no change in the interest rate. The IS curve has therefore shifted right from  $IS_1$  to  $IS_2$ . The nominal interest rate and hence the exchange rate are unchanged in this example, as seen in panel (c).

The lesson: a reduction in taxes shifts the IS curve out.

- A change in the foreign interest rate or expected future exchange rate. A rise in the foreign interest rate  $i^{*}$  or a rise in the future expected exchange rate  $E^{e}$  causes a depreciation of the home currency, all else equal (recall that in the forex market, the FR curve shifts out because the return on foreign deposits has increased; if the home interest rate is unchanged,  $E$  must rise). A rise in  $E$  causes the real exchange rate to depreciate, because prices are sticky. As a result,  $TB$  rises via expenditure switching, and demand increases. Because  $C, I,$ and  $G$  do not change, there is an excess of demand, and supply has to rise to restore equilibrium. Output  $Y$  increases, and the IS curve shifts right.

The lesson: an increase in the foreign return (via  $i^*$  or  $E^e$ ) shifts the IS curve out.

- A change in the home or foreign price level. If prices are flexible, then a rise in foreign prices or a fall in domestic prices causes a home real depreciation, raising  $q = E\overline{P}^{*} / \overline{P}$ . This real depreciation causes  $TB$  to rise and, all else equal, demand will rise to a position like  $D_{2}$ . With an excess of demand, supply has to rise to restore equilibrium. Output  $Y$  must increase, and the IS curve shifts right.

The lesson: an increase  $P^{*}$  or a decrease in  $P$  shifts the IS curve out.

These examples show that the position of the IS curve depends on various factors that we treat as given (or exogenous). We may write this observation using the notation

$$
I S = I S (G, T, i^{*}, E^{e}, P^{*}, P)
$$

There are many other exogenous shocks to the economy that can be analyzed in a similar fashion—for example, a sudden exogenous change in consumption, investment, or the trade balance. How will the IS curve react in each case? You may have detected a pattern from the preceding discussion.

The general rule is as follows: any type of shock that increases demand at a given level of output will shift the IS curve to the right; any shock that decreases demand will shift the IS curve down.

# Summing Up the IS Curve

When prices are sticky, the IS curve summarizes the relationship between output  $Y$  and the interest rate  $i$  necessary to keep the goods and forex markets in short-run equilibrium. The IS curve is downward-sloping. Why? Lower interest rates stimulate demand via the investment channel and, through exchange rate depreciation, via the trade balance. Higher demand can be satisfied in the short run only by higher output. Thus, when the interest rate falls, output rises, and the economy moves along the IS curve.

As for shifts in the IS curve, we have found that any factor which increases demand  $D$  at a given home interest rate  $i$  must cause the demand curve to shift up, leading to higher output  $Y$  and, as a result, an outward shift in the IS curve.

To conclude, the main factors that shift the IS curve out can be summed up as follows:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/ab03bd033c7ed789924541c6bc08b15ca36463c910692a0f38efc98bdd6bb982.jpg)

The opposite changes lead to a decrease in demand and shift the demand curve down and the IS curve to the left.

# 4 Money Market Equilibrium: Deriving the LM Curve

The IS curve links the forex market and the goods market as depicted by the Keynesian cross. It summarizes combinations of  $Y$  and  $i$  at which goods demand equals goods supply in a way that is consistent with forex market equilibrium. We have now taken care of equilibria in two out of three markets, so there is only one market left to worry about. In this section, we derive a set of combinations of  $Y$  and  $i$  that ensures equilibrium in the money market, a concept that can be represented graphically as the LM curve.

The LM curve is more straightforward to derive than the IS curve for a couple of reasons. First, the money market is something we have already studied in earlier chapters, so we already have all the tools we need to build the LM curve. Second, unlike the IS curve, the open-economy LM curve is no different from the closed-economy LM curve, so there will be no new material here if you have previously studied the closed-economy IS-LM model in another course.

# Money Market Recap

In our earlier study of the money market, we assumed that the level of output or income  $Y$  was given. In deriving the LM curve, we now face a new question: What happens in the money market when an economy's output changes?

In the short-run, the price level is assumed to be sticky at a level  $\overline{P}$ , and the money market is in equilibrium when the demand for real money balances  $L(i)Y$  equals the real money supply  $M / \overline{P}$ :

$$
\frac{M}{\bar {P}} = \underbrace {L (i) Y}_{\substack {\text{Real} \\ \text{money} \\ \text{supply}}} \tag{18 - 2}
$$

Figure 18-10, panel (a), shows that real money demand  $MD$  varies inversely with the nominal interest rate. As a result of this relationship, the demand curve for real money balances slopes downward. The real money supply  $MS$  is assumed to be fixed for now. Initially, the level of output is at  $Y_{1}$  and the money market is in equilibrium at  $1'$ , where real money demand is on  $MD_{1}$  at  $M / \overline{P} = L(i_{1})Y_{1}$ .

If output changes, the real money demand curve shifts. For example, if output rises to  $Y_{2}$  and the real money supply  $M / \overline{P}$  remains fixed, then real money demand increases because more output implies a larger number of transactions in the economy for which money is needed. The real money demand curve shifts right to  $MD_{2}$ . To keep money supply and demand equal,  $M / \overline{P} = L(i_{2})Y_{2}$ , the interest rate rises from  $i = i_{1}$  to  $i = i_{2}$ . Equilibrium moves from  $1'$  to  $2'$ .

# Deriving the LM Curve

This exercise can be repeated for any level of output  $Y$ . Doing so will generate a combination of interest rates  $i$  and outputs  $Y$  for which the money market is in equilibrium. This set of points, called the LM curve, is drawn in Figure 18-10, panel (b).

For example, if the real money supply is fixed at  $M / \overline{P}$ , an increase in output from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$  generates a rise in the nominal interest rate from  $i_{1}$  to  $i_{2}$  in panel (a), as we have just seen. This change can also be depicted as a move from point 1 to point 2 along the LM curve, as shown in panel (b).

# FIGURE 18-10

Deriving the LM Curve If there is an increase in real income or output from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$  in panel (b), the effect in the money market in panel (a) is to shift the demand for real money balances to the right, all else equal. If the real supply of money, MS, is held fixed at  $M / \overline{P}$ , then the interest rate rises from  $i_{1}$  to  $i_{2}$  and money market equilibrium moves from point 1' to point 2'. The relationship thus described between the interest rate and income, all else equal, is known as the LM curve and is depicted in panel (b) by the shift from point 1 to point 2. The LM curve is upward-sloping: when the output level rises from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ , the interest rate rises from  $i_{1}$  to  $i_{2}$ . The LM curve in panel (b) describes all combinations of  $i$  and  $Y$  that are consistent with money market equilibrium in panel (a).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/c8505d6b90b2dcd2c46e342d819d896d9205f2e3d1e408e0ac65719fb90499a7.jpg)

(b) LM Diagram

We have now derived the shape of the LM curve, which describes money market equilibrium. When output rises from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ , the interest rate rises from  $i_{1}$  to  $i_{2}$ . The LM curve is an upward-sloping relationship between the interest rate  $i$  and output  $Y$ .

The two ways of depicting the money market equilibrium are entirely equivalent. The money market diagram shows the relationship between real money balances demanded and supplied at different interest rates, holding output fixed. The LM curve diagram shows the relationship between output and the interest rate holding real money balances as fixed. Because the LM curve does not hold output fixed, it is important to developing our model of how output, interest rates, and exchange rates fluctuate in the short run.

# Factors That Shift the LM Curve

An important reason for a shift in the LM curve is a change in the real money supply. (Changes in output result in a move along a given LM curve.) The LM curve tells us the interest rate  $i$  that equilibrates the money market at any given level of output  $Y$ . Given  $Y$ , we know that the equilibrium interest rate  $i$  depends on real money supply  $M / \overline{P}$ , and so the position of the LM curve depends on  $M / \overline{P}$ .

The effect of the real money supply on a nation's output or income is important because we are often interested in the impact of monetary policy changes on overall economic activity. To see how this effect operates via the LM curve, we can examine the money market diagram in Figure 18-11, panel (a). An increase in the nominal money supply  $M$  with sticky prices raises real money supply from  $M_{1} / \overline{P}$  to  $M_{2} / \overline{P}$  and shifts the real money supply curve  $MS$  to the right.

What happens in the LM diagram if the exogenous real money supply  $M / \overline{P}$  changes in this way? For a given level of output  $Y$ , the increased supply of real money drives the interest rate down to  $i_2$ , and equilibrium in the money market shifts from point  $1'$  to point  $2'$ . A decrease in the interest rate to  $i_2$  when the level of output is unchanged at  $Y$  means that we cannot be on the same LM curve as before. There must have been a downward shift of the LM curve from  $LM_1$  to  $LM_2$  in Figure 18-11, panel (b).

We have shown the following: an increase in real money supply shifts the LM curve down or to the right; a decrease in the real money supply shifts the LM curve up or to the left.

Thus, the position of the LM curve is a function of real money supply:

$$
L M = L M (M / \overline {{P}})
$$

Remember that in this short-run model of the economy, prices are sticky and treated as given, so any change in the real money supply in the short run is caused by changes in the nominal money supply  $M$ , which for now we take as given or exogenous.

Other factors can influence the position of the LM curve. In addition to changes in the money supply, exogenous changes in real money demand will also cause the LM curve to shift. For example, for a given money supply, a decrease in the demand for real money balances (an increase in the  $L$  function) at a given level of output  $Y$  will tend to lower the interest rate, all else equal, which would be depicted as a shift down or to the right in the LM curve.

# Summing Up the LM Curve

When prices are sticky, the LM curve summarizes the relationship between output  $Y$  and interest rate  $i$  necessary to keep the money market in short-run equilibrium for a given level of the real money supply. The LM curve is upward-sloping. Why? In a money

FIGURE 18-11

Change in the Money Supply Shifts the LM Curve In the money market, shown in panel (a), we hold fixed the level of real income or output,  $Y$ , and hence real money demand,  $MD$ . All else equal, we show the effect of an increase in money supply from  $M_1$  to  $M_2$ . The real money supply curve moves out from  $MS_1$  to  $MS_2$ . This moves the equilibrium from  $1'$  to  $2'$ , lowering the interest rate from  $i_1$  to  $i_2$ . In the LM diagram, shown in panel (b), the interest rate has fallen, with no change in the level of income or output, so the economy moves from point 1 to point 2. The LM curve has therefore shifted down from  $LM_1$  to  $LM_2$ .

market equilibrium, if real money supply is constant, then real money demand must also be constant. If output rises, real money demand rises and to maintain equilibrium, real money demand must contract. This contraction in real money demand is accomplished by a rise in the interest rate. Thus, on the LM curve, when output rises, so, too, does the interest rate.

The following factors shift the LM curve:

# Factors That Shift the LM Curve

```txt
Rise in (nominal) money supply  $M$  LM curve Any shift left in the money demand function  $L$  shifts down or right Decrease in equilibrium home interest rate at given level of output Y

The opposite changes lead to an increase in the home interest rate and shift the LM curve up or to the left.

# 5 The Short-Run IS-LM-FX Model of an Open Economy

We are now in a position to fully characterize an open economy that is in equilibrium in goods, money, and forex markets, as shown in Figure 18-12. This IS-LM-FX figure combines the goods market (the IS curve), the money market (the LM curve), and the forex (FX) market diagrams.

The IS and LM curves are both drawn in panel (a). The goods and forex markets are in equilibrium if and only if the economy is on the IS curve. The money market is in equilibrium if and only if the economy is on the LM curve. Thus, all three markets are in equilibrium if and only if the economy is at point 1, where  $IS$  and  $LM$  intersect.

The forex market, or FX market, is drawn in panel (b). The domestic return  $DR$  in the forex market equals the money market interest rate. Equilibrium is at point  $1'$  where the foreign return  $FR$  is equal to domestic return  $i$ .

In the remainder of this chapter, and in the rest of this book, we make extensive use of this two-panel IS-LM-FX diagram of the open-economy equilibrium to analyze the short-run response of an open economy to various types of shocks. In particular, we look at how government policies affect the economy and the extent to which they can be employed to enhance macroeconomic performance and stability.

# Macroeconomic Policies in the Short Run

Now that we understand the open-economy IS-LM-FX model and all the factors that influence an economy's short-run equilibrium, we can use the model to look at how a nation's key macroeconomic variables (output, exchange rates, trade balance) are affected in the short run by changes in government macroeconomic policies.

We focus on the two main policy actions: changes in monetary policy, implemented through changes in the money supply, and changes in fiscal policy, involving changes in government spending or taxes. Of particular interest is the question of whether governments can use such policies to insulate the economy from fluctuations in output.

We will see that the impact of these policies is profoundly affected by a nation's choice of exchange rate regime, and we will consider the two polar cases of fixed and

FIGURE 18-12

Equilibrium in the IS-LM-FX Model In panel (a), the IS and LM curves are both drawn. The goods and forex markets are in equilibrium when the economy is on the IS curve. The money market is in equilibrium when the economy is on the LM curve. Both markets are in equilibrium if and only if the economy is at point 1, the unique point of intersection of IS and LM. In panel (b), the forex (FX) market is shown. The domestic return,  $DR$ , in the forex market equals the money market interest rate. Equilibrium is at point  $1'$  where the foreign return  $FR$  equals domestic return,  $i$ .

floating exchange rates. Many countries are on some kind of flexible exchange rate regime and many are on some kind of fixed regime, so considering policy effects under both fixed and floating systems is essential.

The key assumptions of this section are as follows. The economy begins in a state of long-run equilibrium. We then consider policy changes in the home economy, assuming that conditions in the foreign economy (i.e., the rest of the world) are unchanged. The home economy is subject to the usual short-run assumption of a sticky price level at home and abroad. Furthermore, we assume that the forex market operates freely and unrestricted by capital controls and that the exchange rate is determined by market forces.

Temporary Policies, Unchanged Expectations Finally, we examine only temporary changes in policies. We will assume that long-run expectations about the future state of the economy are unaffected by the policy changes. In particular, the future expected exchange rate  $E^{e}$  is held fixed. The reason for studying temporary policies is that we are primarily interested in how governments use fiscal and monetary policies to handle temporary shocks and business cycles in the short run, and our model is applicable only in the short run.

The key lesson of this section is that policies matter and can have significant macroeconomic effects in the short run. Moreover, their impacts depend in a big way on the type of exchange rate regime in place. Once we understand these linkages, we will better understand the contentious and ongoing debates about exchange rates and macroeconomic policies, including the never-ending arguments over the merits of fixed and floating exchange rates (a topic covered in detail in the next chapter).

# Monetary Policy Under Floating Exchange Rates

In this policy experiment, we consider a temporary monetary expansion in the home country when the exchange rate is allowed to float. Because the expansion is not permanent, we assume there is no change in long-run expectations so that the expected future exchange rate remains steady at  $E^{e}$ . This means that there is no change in the expected foreign return curve in the forex market.

Figure 18-13 illustrates the predictions of the model. In panel (a) in the IS-LM diagram, the goods and money markets are initially in equilibrium at point 1. The interest rate in the money market is also the domestic return  $DR_{1}$  that prevails in the forex market. In panel (b), the forex market is initially in equilibrium at point  $1'$ .

A temporary monetary expansion that increases the money supply from  $M_1$  to  $M_2$  would shift the LM curve to the right in panel (a) from  $LM_1$  to  $LM_2$ , causing the interest rate to fall from  $i_1$  to  $i_2$ . The domestic return falls from  $DR_1$  to  $DR_2$ . In panel (b), the lower interest rate would imply that the exchange rate must depreciate, rising from  $E_1$  to  $E_2$ . As the interest rate falls (increasing investment  $I$ ) and the exchange rate depreciates (increasing the trade balance), demand increases, which corresponds to the move down the IS curve from point 1 to point 2. Output expands from  $Y_1$  to  $Y_2$ . The new equilibrium corresponds to points 2 and  $2'$ .

As the interest rate falls (increasing investment,  $I$ ) and the exchange rate depreciates (increasing the trade balance), demand increases, which corresponds to the move down the IS curve from point 1 to point 2. Output expands from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ . The new equilibrium corresponds to points 2 and  $2'$ .

The intuition for this result is as follows: monetary expansion tends to lower the home interest rate, all else equal. A lower interest rate stimulates demand in two ways. First, directly in the goods market, it causes investment demand  $I$  to increase. Second, indirectly, it causes the exchange rate to depreciate in the forex market, which in turn causes expenditure switching in the goods market, which causes the trade balance  $TB$  to increase. Both  $I$  and  $TB$  are sources of demand and both increase.

To sum up: a temporary monetary expansion under floating exchange rates is effective in combating economic downturns because it boosts output. It also lowers the home interest rate, and causes a depreciation of the exchange rate. What happens to the trade balance cannot be predicted with certainty: increased home output will decrease the trade balance as the demand for imports will rise, but the real depreciation will increase the trade balance, because expenditure switching will tend to raise exports and diminish imports. In practice, economists tend to assume that the latter outweighs the former, so a temporary expansion of the money supply is usually predicted to increase the trade balance. (The case of a temporary contraction of monetary policy has opposite effects. As an exercise, work through this case using the same graphical apparatus.)

# Monetary Policy Under Fixed Exchange Rates

Now let's look at what happens when a temporary monetary expansion occurs when the home country fixes its exchange rate with the foreign country at  $\overline{E}$ . The key to understanding this experiment is to recall the uncovered interest parity condition: the home interest rate must equal the foreign interest rate under a fixed exchange rate.

Figure 18-14 puts the model to work. In panel (a) in the IS-LM diagram, the goods and money markets are initially in equilibrium at point 1. In panel (b), the forex market is initially in equilibrium at point  $1'$ .

A temporary monetary expansion that increases the money supply from  $M_{1}$  to  $M_{2}$  would shift the LM curve down and to the right in panel (a), and the interest rate would tend to fall, as we have just seen. In panel (b), the lower interest rate would imply that the exchange rate would tend to rise or depreciate toward  $E_{2}$ . This is inconsistent with the pegged exchange rate  $\overline{E}$ , so the policy makers cannot alter monetary policy and shift the LM curve in this way. They must leave the money supply equal to  $M_{1}$  and the economy cannot deviate from its initial equilibrium.

This example illustrates a key lesson: under a fixed exchange rate, autonomous monetary policy is not an option. What is going on? Remember that under a fixed exchange rate, the home interest rate must exactly equal the foreign interest rate,  $i = i^{*}$ , according to the uncovered interest parity condition. Any shift in the LM curve would violate this restriction and break the fixed exchange rate.

To sum up: monetary policy under fixed exchange rates is impossible to undertake. Fixing the exchange rate means giving up monetary policy autonomy. In an earlier chapter, we learned about the trilemma: countries cannot simultaneously allow capital mobility, maintain fixed exchange rates, and pursue an autonomous monetary policy. We have now just seen the trilemma at work in the IS-LM-FX framework. By illustrating a potential benefit of autonomous monetary policy (the ability to use monetary policy to increase output), the model clearly exposes one of the major costs of fixed exchange rates. Monetary policy, which in principle could be used to influence the economy in the short run, is ruled out by a fixed exchange rate.

# Fiscal Policy Under Floating Exchange Rates

We now turn to fiscal policy under a floating exchange rate. In this example, we consider a temporary increase in government spending from  $\overline{G}_1$  to  $\overline{G}_2$  in the home economy. Again, the effect is not permanent, so there are no changes in long-run expectations, and in particular the expected future exchange rate remains steady at  $E^e$ . Figure 18-15 shows what happens in our model. In panel (a) in the IS-LM diagram, the goods and money markets are initially in equilibrium at point 1. The interest rate in the money market is also the domestic return  $DR_1$  that prevails in the forex market. In panel (b), the forex market is initially in equilibrium at point  $1'$ .

A temporary fiscal expansion that increases government spending from  $\overline{G}_1$  to  $\overline{G}_2$  would shift the IS curve to the right in panel (a) from  $IS_1$  to  $IS_2$ , causing the interest rate to rise from  $i_1$  to  $i_2$ . The domestic return rises from  $DR_1$  to  $DR_2$ . In panel (b), the higher interest rate would imply that the exchange rate must appreciate, falling from  $E_1$  to  $E_2$ . As the interest rate rises (decreasing investment  $I$ ) and the exchange rate appreciates (decreasing the trade balance  $TB$ ), demand still tends to rise overall as government spending increases, which corresponds to the move up the LM curve from point 1 to point 2. Output expands from  $Y_1$  to  $Y_2$ . The new equilibrium is at points 2 and  $2'$ .

What is happening here? The fiscal expansion raises output as the IS curve shifts right. But the increases in output will raise interest rates, all else equal, given a fixed money supply. The resulting higher interest rates will reduce the investment component of demand, and this limits the rise in demand to less than the increase in government spending. This impact of fiscal expansion on investment is often referred to as crowding out by economists.

FIGURE 18-15

Fiscal Policy Under Floating Exchange Rates In panel (a) in the IS-LM diagram, the goods and money markets are initially in equilibrium at point 1. The interest rate in the money market is also the domestic return,  $DR_{1}$ , that prevails in the forex market. In panel (b), the forex market is initially in equilibrium at point  $1'$ . A temporary fiscal expansion that increases government spending from  $\bar{G}_{1}$  to  $\bar{G}_{2}$  would shift the IS curve to the right in panel (a) from  $IS_{1}$  to  $IS_{2}$ , causing the interest rate to rise from  $i_{1}$  to  $i_{2}$ . The domestic return shifts up from  $DR_{1}$  to  $DR_{2}$ . In panel (b), the higher interest rate would imply that the exchange rate must appreciate, falling from  $E_{1}$  to  $E_{2}$ . As the interest rate rises (decreasing investment,  $I$ ) and the exchange rate appreciates (decreasing the trade balance), demand falls, which corresponds to the move along the LM curve from point 1 to point 2. Output expands from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ . The new equilibrium corresponds to points 2 and  $2'$ .

The higher interest rate also causes the home currency to appreciate. As home consumers switch their consumption to now less expensive foreign goods, the trade balance will fall. Thus, the higher interest rate also (indirectly) leads to a crowding out of net exports, and this too limits the rise in output to less than the increase in government spending. Thus, in an open economy, fiscal expansion not only crowds out investment (by raising the interest rate) but also crowds out net exports (by causing the exchange rate to appreciate).

To sum up: a temporary expansion of fiscal policy under floating exchange rates is effective. It raises output at home, raises the interest rate, causes an appreciation of the exchange rate, and decreases the trade balance. (A temporary contraction of fiscal policy has opposite effects. As an exercise, work through the contraction case using the same graphical apparatus.)

# Fiscal Policy Under Fixed Exchange Rates

Now let's see how the outcomes differ when the home country pegs its exchange rate with respect to the foreign country at  $\overline{E}$ . The key is to recall the parity condition: the home interest rate must remain exactly equal to the foreign interest rate for the peg to hold.

Figure 18-16 shows what happens in this case. In panel (a) in the IS-LM diagram, the goods and money markets are initially in equilibrium at point 1. The interest rate in the money market is also the domestic return  $DR_{1}$  that prevails in the forex market. In panel (b), the forex market is initially in equilibrium at point  $1'$ .

Fiscal Policy Under Fixed Exchange Rates In panel (a) in the IS-LM diagram, the goods and money markets are initially in equilibrium at point 1. The interest rate in the money market is also the domestic return,  $DR_{1}$ , that prevails in the forex market. In panel (b), the forex market is initially in equilibrium at point  $1'$ . A temporary fiscal expansion on its own increases government spending from  $\bar{G}_{1}$  to  $\bar{G}_{2}$  and would shift the IS curve to the right in panel (a) from  $IS_{1}$  to  $IS_{2}$ , causing the interest rate to rise from  $i_{1}$  to  $i_{2}$ . The domestic return would then rise from  $DR_{1}$  to  $DR_{2}$ . In panel (b), the higher interest rate would imply that the exchange rate must appreciate, falling from  $\bar{E}$  to  $E_{2}$ . To maintain the peg, the monetary authority must now intervene, shifting the LM curve down, from  $LM_{1}$  to  $LM_{2}$ . The fiscal expansion thus prompts a monetary expansion. In the end, the interest rate and exchange rate are left unchanged, and output expands dramatically from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ . The new equilibrium corresponds to points 2 and  $2'$ .

A temporary fiscal expansion that increases government spending from  $\overline{G}_1$  to  $\overline{G}_2$  would shift the IS curve to the right in panel (a) from  $IS_1$  to  $IS_2$ , causing the interest rate to rise from  $i_1$  to  $i_2$ . The domestic return would rise from  $DR_1$  to  $DR_2$ . In panel (b), the higher interest rate would imply that the exchange rate must appreciate, falling from  $\overline{E}$  to  $E_2$ . To maintain the peg, the monetary authority must intervene, shifting the LM curve to the right also, from  $LM_1$  to  $LM_2$ . The fiscal expansion thus prompts a monetary expansion. In the end, the interest rate and exchange rate are left unchanged, and output expands dramatically from  $Y_1$  to  $Y_2$ . The new equilibrium corresponds to points 2 and  $2'$ .

What is happening here? From the last example, we know that there is appreciation pressure associated with a fiscal expansion if the currency is allowed to float. To maintain the peg, the monetary authority must immediately alter its monetary policy at the very moment the fiscal expansion occurs so that the LM curve shifts from  $LM_{1}$  to  $LM_{2}$ . The way to do this is to expand the money supply, and this generates pressure for depreciation, offsetting the appreciation pressure. If the monetary authority pulls this off, the market exchange rate will stay at the initial pegged level  $\overline{E}$ .

Thus, when a country is operating under a fixed exchange, fiscal policy is supereffective because any fiscal expansion by the government forces an immediate monetary expansion by the central bank to keep the exchange rate steady. The double, and simultaneous, expansion of demand by the fiscal and monetary authorities imposes a huge stimulus on the economy, and output rises from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$  (beyond the level achieved by the same fiscal expansion under a floating exchange rate).

To sum up: a temporary expansion of fiscal policy under fixed exchange rates raises output at home by a considerable amount. (The case of a temporary contraction of fiscal policy would have similar but opposite effects. As an exercise, work through this case using the same graphical apparatus.)

# Summary

We have now examined the operation of fiscal and monetary policies under both fixed and flexible exchange rates and have seen how the effects of these policies differ dramatically depending on the exchange rate regime. The outcomes can be summarized as follows:

Responses to Policy Shocks in the IS-LM-FX Model

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Exchange Rate Regime</td><td rowspan="2">Policy</td><td colspan="5">Impact on:</td></tr><tr><td>i</td><td>E</td><td>I</td><td>TB</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Floating</td><td>Monetary expansion</td><td>↓</td><td>↑</td><td>↑</td><td>↑?</td><td>↑</td></tr><tr><td>Fiscal expansion</td><td>↑</td><td>↓</td><td>↓</td><td>↓</td><td>↑</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Fixed</td><td>Monetary expansion</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Fiscal expansion</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>↓</td><td>↑</td></tr></table>

In this table, an up arrow  $\uparrow$  indicates that the variable rises; a down arrow  $\downarrow$  indicates that the variables falls; and a zero indicates no effect. The effects would be reversed for contractionary policies. The row of zeros for monetary expansion under fixed rates reflects the fact that this infeasible policy cannot be undertaken.

In a floating exchange rate regime, autonomous monetary and fiscal policy is feasible. The power of monetary policy to expand demand comes from two forces in the short run: lower interest rates boost investment and a depreciated exchange rate boosts the trade balance, all else equal. In the end, though, the trade balance will experience downward pressure from an import rise due to the increase in home output and income. The net effect on output and investment is positive, and the net effect on the trade balance is unclear—but in practice it, too, is likely to be positive.

Expansionary fiscal policy is also effective under a floating regime, even though the impact of extra spending is offset by crowding out in two areas: investment is crowded out by higher interest rates, and the trade balance is crowded out by an appreciated exchange rate. Thus, on net, investment falls and the trade balance also falls, and the latter effect is unambiguously amplified by additional import demand arising from increased home output.

In a fixed exchange rate regime, monetary policy loses its power for two reasons. First, interest parity implies that the domestic interest rate cannot move independently of the foreign rate, so investment demand cannot be manipulated. Second, the peg means that there can be no movement in the exchange rate, so the trade balance cannot be manipulated by expenditure switching.

Only fiscal policy is feasible under a fixed regime. Tax cuts or spending increases by the government can generate additional demand. But fiscal expansion then requires a monetary expansion to keep interest rates steady and maintain the peg. Fiscal policy becomes ultrapowerful in a fixed exchange rate setting—the reason for this is that if interest rates and exchange rates are held steady by the central bank, investment and the trade balance are never crowded out by fiscal policy. Monetary policy follows fiscal policy and amplifies it.

# 6 Stabilization Policy

We now have seen that macroeconomic policies can effect economic activity in the short run. These effects open up the possibility that the authorities can use changes in policies to try to keep the economy at or near its full-employment level of output. This is the essence of stabilization policy. If the economy is hit by a temporary adverse shock, policy makers could use expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to prevent a deep recession. Conversely, if the economy is pushed by a shock above its full employment level of output, contractionary policies could tame the boom.

For example, suppose a temporary adverse shock such as a sudden decline in investment, consumption, or export demand shifts the IS curve to the left. Or suppose an adverse shock such as a sudden increase in money demand suddenly moves the LM curve up. Either shock would cause home output to fall. In principle, the home policy makers could offset these shocks by using fiscal or monetary policy to shift either the IS curve or LM curve (or both) to cause an offsetting increase in output. When used judiciously, monetary and fiscal policies can thus be used to stabilize the economy and absorb shocks.

The policies must be used with care, however. If the economy is stable and growing, an additional temporary monetary or fiscal stimulus may cause an unsustainable boom that will, when the stimulus is withdrawn, turn into an undesirable bust. In their efforts to do good, policy makers must be careful not to destabilize the economy through the ill-timed, inappropriate, or excessive use of monetary and fiscal policies.

# APPLICATION

# The Right Time for Austerity?

After the global financial crisis, many observers would have predicted economic difficulties for Eastern Europe in the short run. Most countries had seen a rapid boom before 2008, with large expansions of credit, capital inflows, and high inflation of local wages and prices creating real appreciations: the same ingredients for a sharp economic downturn after the crisis as seen in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Yet not all countries suffered the same fate. Here we use our analytical tools to look at two opposite cases: Poland, which fared well, and Latvia, which did not.

In our framework, as the shocks first hit, the demand for Poland's and Latvia's exports declined as a result of a contraction in foreign output  $Y^{*}$  in their trading partners, mainly the rest of Europe. In addition Poland and Latvia faced negative shocks to consumption and investment demand as consumers and investors cut back their expenditures in the face of uncertainty and tighter credit due to financial sector problems. These events would be represented by a leftward shift of Poland's and Latvia's IS curves from  $IS_{1}$  to  $IS_{2}$ , which we show in Figure 18-17.

But the policy responses differed in each country, illustrating the contrasts between fixed and floating regimes. Because the Poles had a floating exchange rate, they were able to pursue strong monetary expansion and let the currency depreciate. They also maintained their plans for government spending in order to combat the decline in demand. Because the Letts were pegging to the euro, they could not use monetary policy at all, and they had to pursue aggressive austerity and slash government spending in order to satisfy the demands of an EU and IMF assistance program. Our modeling framework makes some predictions about the consequences of these policy choices.

In Figure 18-17, panels (a) and (b), Poland first goes from points  $1(1')$  to point  $2(2')$ , and the initial shock is partially offset by the induced depreciation of the Polish zloty and increased investment thanks to lower interest rates. Then the equilibrium would be at  $2'$ . In the end, demand would still be below its initial level and a recession would result with output falling from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ . However, the central bank responded with expansionary monetary policy, a shift out in the LM curve to  $LM_{3}$ . The economy shifted

Examples of Policy Choices Under Floating and Fixed Exchange Rates In panels (a) and (c) in the IS-LM diagram, the goods and money markets are initially in equilibrium at point 1. The interest rate is also the domestic return,  $DR_{1}$ , that prevails in the forex market. In panels (b) and (d), the forex market is initially in equilibrium at point  $1'$ . An exogenous negative shock to demand (e.g., a collapse in foreign income and/or a financial crisis at home) causes the IS curve to shift in from  $IS_{1}$  to  $IS_{2}$ . Without further action, output and interest rates would fall and the exchange rate would tend to depreciate. In panels (a) and (b), we explore what happens when the central bank can stabilize output at its former level by responding with a monetary policy expansion, increasing the money supply and causing the LM curve to shift out from  $LM_{1}$  to  $LM_{3}$ . The new equilibrium corresponds to points 3 and  $3'$ . Output is now stabilized at the original level  $Y_{1}$ . The interest rate falls further from  $i_{1}$  all the way to  $i_{3}$ . The domestic return falls from  $DR_{1}$  to  $DR_{3}$ , and the exchange rate depreciates all the way from  $E_{1}$  to  $E_{3}$ . In panels (c) and (d) we explore what happens when the exchange rate is fixed and the government pursues austerity and cuts government spending  $G$ . This causes the IS curve to shift in even further from  $IS_{2}$  to  $IS_{4}$ . If the central bank does nothing, the home interest rate would fall further and the exchange rate would depreciate sharply at point 2 and  $2'$ . To maintain the peg, as dictated by the trilemma, the home central bank must engage in contractionary monetary policy, decreasing the money supply and causing the LM curve to shift in all the way from  $LM_{1}$  to  $LM_{4}$ . The new equilibrium corresponds to points 4 and  $4'$ . The peg is preserved, but output collapses to the new level  $Y_{4}$ .

to point  $3(3')$ : even lower interest rates amplified the depreciation of the zloty and stimulated demand through investment and expenditure-switching channels. In contrast, as shown in Figure 18-17, panels (c) and (d), Latvia cut government spending, so when their IS curve shifted in, they shifted it even farther to  $IS_4$ . Bound by the trilemma, Latvia's LM curve had to follow those shifts in lockstep and move in to  $LM_4$  in order to maintain the lat-euro peg. The Latvian economy moved from point  $1(1')$  to point  $4(4')$ .

The model predicts that a recession might be avoided in Poland, but that there could be a very deep recession in Latvia. What actually happened? Check out the accompanying news item (see Headlines: Poland Is Not Latvia).

# Problems in Policy Design and Implementation

In this chapter, we have looked at open-economy macroeconomics in the short run and at the role that monetary and fiscal policies can play in determining economic outcomes. The simple models we used have clear consequences. On the face of it, if policy makers were really operating in such an uncomplicated environment, they would have the ability to exert substantial control and could always keep output steady with no unemployed resources and no inflation pressure. In reality, life is more complicated for policy makers for a variety of reasons.

Policy Constraints Policy makers may not always be free to apply the policies they desire. A fixed exchange rate rules out any use of monetary policy. Other firm monetary or fiscal policy rules, such as interest rate rules or balanced-budget rules, place limits on policy. Even if policy makers decide to act, other constraints may bind them. While it is always feasible to print money, it may not be possible (technically or politically) to raise the real resources necessary for a fiscal expansion. Countries with weak tax systems or poor creditworthiness—problems that afflict developing countries—may find themselves unable to tax or borrow to finance an expansion of spending even if they wished to do so.

Incomplete Information and the Inside Lag Our models assume that the policy makers have full knowledge of the state of the economy before they take corrective action: they observe the economy's IS and LM curves and know what shocks have hit. In reality, macroeconomic data are compiled slowly and it may take weeks or months for policy makers to fully understand the state of the economy today. Even then, it will take time to formulate a policy response (the lag between shock and policy actions is called the inside lag). On the monetary side, there may be a delay between policy meetings. On the fiscal side, it may take even more time to pass a bill through the legislature and then enable a real change in spending or taxing activity by the public sector.

Policy Response and the Outside Lag Even if they finally receive the correct information, policy makers then have to formulate the right response given by the model. In particular, they must not be distracted by other policies or agendas, nor subject to influence by interest groups that might wish to see different policies enacted. Finally, it takes time for whatever policies are enacted to have any effect on the economy, through the spending decisions of the public and private sectors (the lag between policy actions and effects is called the outside lag).

Long-Horizon Plans Other factors may make investment and the trade balance less sensitive to policy. If the private sector understands that a policy change is temporary, then there may be reasons not to change consumption or investment expenditure.

# Poland Is Not Latvia

Eastern Europe faced difficult times in the Great Recession. Yet not all countries suffered the same fate, as we see from this story, and the macroeconomic data presented and discussed in Figure 18-18.

… Poland and Latvia … inherited woefully deficient institutions from communism and have struggled with many of the same economic ills over the past two decades. They have also adopted staggeringly different approaches to the crisis, one of which was a lot more effective than the other.

… I don't think it's being radical to say that [since 2004] Poland's perform mance is both a lot better and a lot less variable and that if you were going to draw lessons from one of the two countries that it should probably be the country which avoided an enormous bubble and subsequent collapse. What is it that caused Poland's economy to be so sound? Was it austerity? Was it hard money?

… Both Latvia and Poland actually ran rather substantial budget deficits during the height of the crisis, though Latvia's budgeting in the years preceding the crisis was more balanced and restrained than Poland's… . Poland's government spending as a percentage of GDP was also noticeably higher than Latvia's both before the crisis and after it… . You can see how, starting in 2008, Latvia starts to make some sharp cuts while Poland continues its steady, modest increases.

Macroeconomic Policy and Outcomes in Poland and Latvia, 2007-2012 Poland and Latvia reacted differently to adverse demand shocks from outside and inside their economies. Panels (a) and (b) show that Poland pursued expansionary monetary policy, let its currency depreciate against the euro, and kept government spending on a stable growth path. Latvia maintained a fixed exchange rate with the euro and pursued an austerity approach with large government spending cuts from 2009 onward. Panel (c) shows that Poland escaped a recession, with positive growth in all years. In contrast, Latvia fell into a deep depression, and real GDP per capita fell  $20\%$  from its 2007 peak.

Sources: IMF, International Financial Statistics and World Economic Outlook. Exchange rates are 3-month moving averages; all other data are annual.

So, basically, Poland is a country whose government habitually ran budget deficits before, during, and after the crisis, whose government spends a greater percentage of GDP than Latvia, and which did not cut spending in response to the crisis. Latvia, in contrast, ran balanced budgets, had a very small government as a percentage of GDP, and savagely cut spending in response to the crisis. While I don't think you can call Poland "profligate," if economics really were a morality play you'd expect the Latvians to come out way ahead since they've followed the austerity playbook down to the letter. However, in the real world, Poland's economic performance has been vastly, almost comically, superior to Latvia's despite the fact that the country didn't make any "hard choices."

All of this, of course, leaves out monetary policy… . Part of the reason that Latvia's economic performance has been so awful is that it has pegged its currency to the Euro, a course of action which has made the Lat artificially expensive and which made Latvia's course of "internal devaluation" necessary… . Poland did the exact opposite, allowing its currency, the zloty, to depreciate massively against the Euro …

Poland did not, in other words, "defend the zloty" because it realized that a devaluation of its currency would be incredibly helpful. And the Polish economy has continued to churn along while most of its neighbors have either crashed and burned or simply stagnated… .

There are plenty of lessons from Poland's economic success, including the need for effective government regulation (Poland never had an out-of-control bubble like Latvia), the need for exchange rate flexibility, and the extreme importance of a country having its own central bank. These lessons are neither left wing nor right wing, Poland's government is actually quite conservative … Economics just isn't a morality play, and no matter how often the Latvians cast themselves as the diligent and upstanding enforcers of austerity their economic performance over the past five years has still been lousy.

Suppose a firm can either build and operate a plant for several years or not build at all (e.g., the investment might be of an irreversible form). For example, a firm may not care about a higher real interest rate this year and may base its decision on the expected real interest rate that will affect its financing over many years ahead. Similarly, a temporary real appreciation may have little effect on whether a firm can profit in the long run from sales in the foreign market. In such circumstances, firms' investment and export activities may not be very sensitive to short-run policy changes.

Weak Links from the Nominal Exchange Rate to the Real Exchange Rate Our discussion assumed that changes in the nominal exchange rate lead to real exchange rate changes, but the reality can be somewhat different for some goods and services. For example, the dollar depreciated  $42\%$  against the yen from 2008 to 2012, but the U.S. prices of Japanese-made cars, like some Toyotas, barely changed. Why? There are a number of reasons for this weak pass-through phenomenon, including the dollarization of trade and the distribution margins that separate retail prices from port prices (as we saw in Side Bar: Barriers to Expenditure Switching: Pass-Through and the J Curve). The forces of arbitrage may also be weak as a result of noncompetitive market structures: for example, Toyota sells through exclusive dealers and government regulation requires that cars meet different standards in Europe versus the United States. These obstacles allow a firm like Toyota to price to market: to charge a steady U.S. price even as the exchange rate moves temporarily. If a firm can bear (or hedge) the exchange rate risk, it might do this to avoid the volatile sales and alienated customers that might result from repeatedly changing its U.S. retail price list.

Pegged Currency Blocs Our model's predictions are also affected by the fact that for some major countries in the real world, their exchange rate arrangements are characterized—often not as a result of their own choice—by a mix of floating and fixed exchange rate systems with different trading partners. For most of the decade 2000–10, the dollar depreciated markedly against the euro, pound, and several other floating currencies, but in the emerging-market "Dollar Bloc" (China, India, and other countries), the monetary authorities have ensured that the variation in the value of their currencies against the dollar was small or zero. When a large bloc of other countries pegs to the U.S. dollar, this limits the ability of the United States to engineer a real effective depreciation.

Weak Links from the Real Exchange Rate to the Trade Balance Our discussion also assumed that real exchange rate changes lead to changes in the trade balance. There may be several reasons why these linkages are weak in reality. One major reason is transaction costs in trade. Suppose the exchange rate is 1 per euro and an American is consuming a domestic good that costs 100 as opposed to a European good costing 100 = 100. If the dollar appreciates to 0.95 per euro, then the European good looks cheaper on paper, only 95. Should the American switch to the import? Yes, if the good can be moved without cost—but there are few such goods! If shipping costs 10, it still makes sense to consume the domestic good until the exchange rate falls below 0.90 per euro. Practically, this means that expenditure switching may be a nonlinear phenomenon: it will be weak at first and then much stronger as the real exchange rate change grows larger. This phenomenon, coupled with the J curve effects discussed earlier, may cause the response of the trade balance in the short run to be small or even in the wrong direction.

# APPLICATION

# Macroeconomic Policies in the Liquidity Trap

Undoubtedly, one of the most controversial experiments in macroeconomic policymaking began in 2008-10 as monetary and fiscal authorities around the world tried to respond to the major recession that followed the Global Financial Crisis. In this application, we look at the initial U.S. policy response and interpret events using the IS-LM-FX model of this chapter.

The unusual aspect of this crisis was the very rapid realization that monetary policy alone could not fully offset the magnitude of the shock to demand. In the context of our IS-LM-FX model, as consumption and investment fell for exogenous reasons, the shock moved the IS curve very far leftward. One major source of the demand shock was that, as we saw in an earlier chapter, banks were very afraid of taking on risk and sharply reduced their lending to firms and households—and even when they did lend, they were still charging very high interest rates. Thus, even with very expansionary monetary policy, that is, large rightward shifts of the LM curve, low policy interest rates did not translate into cheap borrowing for the private sector. Once the U.S. Federal Reserve had brought its policy rate to zero in December 2008, there was little more it could do to stimulate demand using conventional monetary policies.

This peculiar situation is depicted by the blue lines in Figure 18-19 and differs from the normal IS-LM-FX setup we have seen so far. After the demand shock and the Fed's response to it, the IS curve has moved so far in (to  $IS_{1}$ ) and the LM curve has moved so far out (to  $LM_{1}$ ), that the IS and LM curves now intersect at a very low interest rate: so low that it is equal to zero. In the money market, nominal interest rates can't fall below zero, so another way of describing this situation is to say that the economy was at an IS-LM equilibrium at which the LM curve was absolutely flat and resting on the horizontal axis (at a  $0\%$  interest rate) in the diagram.

(Note that in the FX diagram this would place the domestic return  $DR$  at zero. Also, note that interest rates were by this time at zero in all developed countries, for

Macroeconomic Policies in the Liquidity Trap After a severe negative shock to demand, the IS curve may move very far to the left  $(IS_{1})$ . The nominal interest rate may then fall all the way to the zero lower bound (ZLB), with  $IS_{1}$  intersecting the flat portion of the  $LM_{1}$  curve at point 1, on the horizontal axis, in panel (a). Output is depressed at a level  $Y_{1}$ . In this scenario, monetary policy is impotent because expansionary monetary policy (e.g., a rightward shift from  $LM_{1}$  to  $LM_{2}$ ) cannot lower the interest rate any further. However, fiscal policy may be very effective, and a shift right from  $IS_{1}$  to  $IS_{2}$  leaves the economy still at the ZLB, but with a higher level of output  $Y_{2}$ . (The figure is drawn assuming the ZLB holds in both home and foreign economies, so the FX market is in equilibrium at point  $1'$  with  $E = E^{e}$  at all times.)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/234f9958425bda3af67c8bc19058c74ee620318c88c8cf882e1ddbf68c2d65c2.jpg)

(b) FX Market similar reasons. Thus, it is also appropriate to think of the foreign (e.g., euro) interest rate as also stuck at zero, which in the FX diagram would lower the foreign return  $FR$ .

The situation just described is unusual in several ways. First, monetary policy is powerless in this situation: it cannot be used to lower interest rates because interest rates can't go any lower. In the diagram, moving the LM curve out to  $LM_{2}$  does not dislodge the economy from the horizontal portion of the LM curve. We are still stuck on the  $IS_{1}$  curve at a point 1 and a  $0\%$  percent interest rate. This unfortunate state of affairs is known as the zero lower bound (ZLB). It is also known as a liquidity trap because liquid money and interest-bearing assets have the same interest rate of zero, so there is no opportunity cost to holding money, and thus changes in the supply of central bank money have no effect on the incentive to switch between money and interest-bearing assets.

Can anything be done? Yes. The bad news is that fiscal policy is the only tool now available to increase demand. The good news is that fiscal policy has the potential to be super powerful in this situation. The reason is that as long as interest rates are stuck at zero, and the monetary authorities keep them there, government spending will not crowd out investment or net exports, in contrast to the typical situation we studied earlier in this chapter. In 2009, because the Fed and the private sector anticipated more than a year or two of very high unemployment and falling inflation, everyone had expectations of zero interest rates for a long period.

Did the United States use fiscal policy to try to counteract the recession? Yes. Did it work? Not as well as one might have hoped.

The government's fiscal response took two forms. First was the automatic stabilizer built into existing fiscal policies. In the models that we have studied so far in this chapter, we have assumed that taxes and spending are fixed. In reality, however, they are not fixed, but vary systematically with income. Most important, when income  $Y$  falls in a recession, receipts from income taxes, sales taxes, and so on, all tend to fall as well. In addition, transfer expenditures (like unemployment benefits) tend to go up: a rise in negative taxes, as it were. This decline does not depend on any policy response, and in the 2008-10 period the fall in tax revenues (plus the rise in transfers) was enormous.

The second fiscal response was a discretionary policy, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), better known as the "stimulus" bill. This policy was one of the first actions undertaken by the Obama administration and it was signed into law on February 17, 2009. Some of the president's advisors had originally hoped for a  \$1.4 trillion package, mostly for extra government consumption and investment spending, and also for aid to states. This was to be spread over 2 to 3 years from 2009-11. However, the final compromise deal with Congress was only half as big,\$ 787 billion over three years, and was tilted more toward temporary tax cuts. Most of the stimulus was scheduled to take effect in 2010, not 2009, reflecting the policy lags we noted above. On average, the package amounted to about  $1.5\%$  of GDP in spending and tax cuts.

Some key outcomes are shown in Figure 18-20. As panel (a) shows, the size of the gap between actual and potential output left a huge hole to be filled by fiscal policy. By mid-2009 this hole was about  $6\%$  of potential GDP or over \$1 trillion at an annual rate. Even if the entire stimulus were spent, the fiscal package could at best have filled only about one-quarter of the collapse in demand or  $1.5\%$  of GDP. Policy makers in the government, and many observers, knew the package was too small, but politics stood in the way of a larger package.

The data in panel (a) also show that private consumption fell precipitously. One intention of ARRA was to support private spending through tax cuts. Tax revenues  $T$  did fall considerably (largely at the federal level as shown in panel (b), because states were getting some offsetting transfers via ARRA). But tax cuts did not appear to generate much extra private spending, certainly not enough to offset the initial collapse in consumption expenditure. Many consumers were unsure about the economic recovery, worried about the risks of unemployment, and trying to use whatever "extra" money they got from tax cuts to pay down their debts or save. In addition, because people were trying to hold onto their money (precautionary motives were high), the marginal propensity to consume was probably low. Furthermore, for non-Keynesian consumers, the temporary nature of many of the tax cuts meant that anyone following the principles of Ricardian equivalence would be likely to save the tax cut to pay off an expected future tax liability.

This left government spending  $G$  to do a great deal of the stimulation, but problems arose because of the contrary effects of state and local government policies. As the figure shows, federal expenditures went up, rising by  $0.5\%$  of GDP in 2010. Leaving aside the minuscule size of this change, a big source of trouble was that state and local government expenditures went down by just as much. States and localities imposed

U.S. Fiscal Policy in the Great Recession: Didn't Work or Wasn't Tried? In the U.S. economic slump of 2008-10, output had fallen  $6\%$  below the estimate of potential (full-employment) level of GDP by the first quarter of 2009, as seen in panel (a). This was the worst U.S. recession since the 1930s. Policy responses included automatic fiscal expansion (increases in spending and reductions in taxes), plus an additional discretionary stimulus (the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). The tax part of the stimulus appeared to do very little: significant reductions in taxes seen in panel (b) were insufficient to prop up consumption expenditure, as seen in panel (a), as consumers saved the extra disposable income. And on the government spending side there was no stimulus at all in the aggregate: increases in federal government expenditure were fully offset by cuts in state and local government expenditure, as seen in panel (b).

austerity spending cuts, which were made necessary by calamitous declines in their tax revenues, by their limited ability (or willingness) to borrow, and by the feeble amount of aid to states authorized in the final ARRA package. The net change in overall government expenditures was thus, in the end, zero.

To sum up, the aggregate U.S. fiscal stimulus had four major weaknesses: it was rolled out too slowly, because of policy lags; the overall package was too small, given the magnitude of the decline in aggregate demand; the government spending portion of the stimulus, for which positive expenditure effects were certain, ended up being close to zero, because of state and local cuts; and this left almost all the work to tax cuts (automatic and discretionary) that recipients, for good reasons, were more likely to save rather than spend. With monetary policy impotent and fiscal policy weak and ill designed, the economy remained mired in its worst slump since the 1930s Great Depression.

# 7 Conclusions

The analysis of macroeconomic policy is different in an open economy than in a closed economy. The trade balance generates an additional source of demand, and its fluctuations are driven by changes in output and the real exchange rate. Expenditure switching is a key mechanism at work here: as international relative prices change, demand shifts from foreign to home goods and vice versa.

The open economy IS-LM-FX framework is a workhorse model for analyzing the macroeconomic responses to shocks and to changes in monetary and fiscal policies. Exploring these responses, in turn, draws out some clear contrasts between the operation of fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes.

Under flexible exchange rates, monetary and fiscal policies can be used. Monetary expansions raise output and also lower the interest rate, which stimulates investment and causes a depreciation, which in turn stimulates the trade balance. Fiscal expansions raise output; raise the interest rate, which depresses investment; and cause an appreciation, which in turn lowers the trade balance.

With two policy tools available, the authorities have considerable flexibility. In particular, their ability to let the exchange rate adjust to absorb shocks makes a strong case for a floating exchange rate. Now we can understand the logic behind Robert Mundell's quote at the start of the chapter.

Under fixed exchange rates, monetary policy cannot be used because the home interest rate has to remain equal to the foreign interest rate in order for the exchange rate to remain fixed. But fiscal policy has great power under a fixed exchange rate. Fiscal expansions raise output and force the monetary authority to expand the money supply to prevent any rise in the interest rate and any appreciation of the exchange rate. In contrast to the floating case, in which interest rate increases and exchange rate appreciation put downward pressure on investment and the trade balance, the demand stimulus is even greater.

With only one policy tool available, the authorities in fixed rate regimes have much less flexibility. They also expose the economy to more volatility because any demand shock will entail an immediate and reinforcing monetary shock. The tendency of fixed exchange rate systems to amplify demand shocks helps us understand the logic behind Alec Ford's quote at the start of the chapter.

Whatever the regime, fixed or floating, our findings suggest that macroeconomic policy can in principle be used to stabilize an open economy when it suffers from external shocks. Under floating exchange rates, however, more policy options are available (monetary and fiscal policy responses are feasible) than under fixed exchange rates (only a fiscal policy response is feasible).

Despite these relatively simple lessons, real-world policy design is not straightforward. Policy makers have difficulty identifying shocks, devising the right response, and acting quickly enough to ensure that policy actions have a timely effect. Even then, under some conditions, the economy may respond in unusual ways.

# KEY POINTS

1. In the short run, we assume prices are sticky at some preset level  $P$ . There is thus no inflation, and nominal and real quantities can be considered equivalent. We assume output GDP equals income  $Y$  or GDNI and that the trade balance equals the current account (there are no transfers or factor income from abroad).
2. The Keynesian consumption function says that private consumption spending  $C$  is an increasing function of household disposable income  $Y - T$ .
3. The investment function says that total investment  $I$  is a decreasing function of the real or nominal interest rate  $i$ .
4. Government spending is assumed to be exogenously given at a level  $G$ .
5. The trade balance is assumed to be an increasing function of the real exchange rate  $EP^{*} / P$ , where  $P^{*}$  denotes the foreign price level.
6. The national income identity says that national income or output equals private consumption  $C$ , plus investment  $I$ , plus government spending  $G$ , plus the trade balance  $TB$ :  $Y = C + I + G + TB$ . The right-hand side of this expression is called demand, and its components depend on income, interest rates, and the real exchange rate. In equilibrium, demand must equal the left-hand side, supply, or total output  $Y$ .
7. If the interest rate falls in an open economy, demand is stimulated for two reasons. A lower interest rate directly stimulates investment. A lower interest rate also leads to an exchange rate depreciation, all else equal, which increases the trade balance. This demand must be satisfied for the goods market to remain in equilibrium, so output rises. This is the basis of the IS curve: declines in interest rates must call forth extra output to keep the goods market in equilibrium. Each point on the IS curve represents a combination of output  $Y$  and interest rate  $i$  at which the goods and FX markets are in equilibrium. Because  $Y$  increases as  $i$  decreases, the IS curve is downward-sloping.
8. Real money demand arises primarily from transactions requirements. It increases when the volume of transactions (represented by national income  $Y$ ) increases, and decreases when the opportunity cost of holding money, the nominal interest rate  $i$ , increases.
9. The money market equilibrium says that the demand for real money balances  $L$  must equal the real money supply:  $M / P = L(i)Y$ . This equation is the basis for the LM curve: any increases in output  $Y$  must cause the interest rate to rise, all else equal (e.g., holding fixed real money  $M / P$ ). Each point on the LM curve represents a combination of output  $Y$  and interest rate  $i$  at which the money market is in equilibrium. Because  $i$  increases as  $Y$  increases, the LM curve is upward-sloping.
10. The IS-LM diagram combines the IS and LM curves on one figure and shows the unique short-run equilibrium for output  $Y$  and the interest rate  $i$  that describes simultaneous equilibrium in the goods and money markets. The IS-LM diagram can be coupled with the forex market diagram to summarize conditions in all three markets: goods, money, and forex. This combined IS-LM-FX diagram can then be used to assess the impact of various macroeconomic policies in the short run.
11. Under a floating exchange rate, the interest rate and exchange rate are free to adjust to maintain equilibrium. Thus, government policy is free to move either the IS or LM curves. The effects are as follows:

- Monetary expansion: LM shifts to the right, output rises, interest rate falls, exchange rate rises/depreciates.
- Fiscal expansion: IS shifts to the right, output rises, interest rate rises, exchange rate falls/appreciates.

12. Under a fixed exchange rate, the interest rate always equals the foreign interest rate and the exchange rate is pegged. Thus, the government is not free to move the LM curve: monetary policy must be adjusted to ensure that LM is in such a position that these exchange rate and interest rate conditions hold. The impacts are as follows:

- Monetary expansion: not feasible.
- Fiscal expansion: IS shifts to the right, LM follows it and also shifts to the right, output rises strongly, interest rate and exchange rate are unchanged.

13. The ability to manipulate the IS and LM curves gives the government the capacity to engage in stabilization policies to offset shocks to the economy and to try to maintain a full employment level of output. This is easier said than done, however, because it is difficult to diagnose the correct policy response, and policies often take some time to have an impact, so that by the time the policy effects are felt, they may be ineffective or even counterproductive.

# PROBLEMS

1. In 2001, President George W. Bush and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan were both concerned about a sluggish U.S. economy. They also were concerned about the large U.S. current account deficit. To help stimulate the economy, President Bush proposed a tax cut, while the Fed had been increasing U.S. money supply. Compare the effects of these two policies in terms of their implications for the current account. If policy makers are concerned about the current account deficit, discuss whether stimulatory fiscal policy or monetary policy makes more sense in this case. Then, reconsider similar issues for 2009-10, when the economy was in a deep slump, the Fed had taken interest rates to zero, and the Obama administration was arguing for larger fiscal stimulus.
2. Suppose that American firms become more optimistic and decide to increase investment expenditure today in new factories and office space.

a. How will this increase in investment affect output, interest rates, and the current account?

b. Now repeat part (a), assuming that domestic investment is very responsive to the interest rate so that U.S. firms will cancel most of their new investment plans if the interest rate rises. How will this affect the answer you gave previously?

3. For each of the following situations, use the IS-LM-FX model to illustrate the effects of the shock. For each case, state the effect of the shock on the following variables (increase, decrease, no change, or ambiguous):  $Y, i, E, C, I$ , and  $TB$ . Assume the government allows the exchange rate to float and makes no policy response.

a. Foreign output decreases.

b. Investors expect a depreciation of the home currency.

c. The money supply increases.

d. Government spending increases.

4. How would a decrease in the money supply of Paraguay (currency unit is the "guarani") affect its own output and its exchange rate with Brazil (currency unit is the "real"). Do you think this policy in Paraguay might also affect output across the border in Brazil? Explain.
5. For each of the following situations, use the IS-LM-FX model to illustrate the effects of the shock and the policy response. Note: Assume the government responds by using monetary policy to stabilize output, unlike question 3, and assume the exchange rate is floating. For each case, state the effect of the shock on the following variables (increase, decrease, no change, or ambiguous):  $Y$ ,  $i$ ,  $E$ ,  $C$ ,  $I$ , and  $TB$ .

a. Foreign output decreases.

b. Investors expect a depreciation of the home currency.

c. The money supply increases.

d. Government spending increases.

6. Repeat the previous question, assuming the central bank responds in order to maintain a fixed exchange rate. In which case or cases will the government response be the same as in the previous question?
7. This question explores IS and FX equilibria in a numerical example.

a. The consumption function is  $C = 1.5 + 0.75(Y - T)$ . What is the marginal propensity to consume MPC? What is the marginal propensity to save MPS?

b. The trade balance is  $TB = 5(1 - [1 / E]) - 0.25(Y - 8)$ . What is the marginal propensity to consume foreign goods  $MPCF$ ? What is the marginal propensity to consume home goods  $MPCH$ ?

c. The investment function is  $I = 2 - 10i$ . What is investment when the interest rate  $i$  is equal to  $0.10 = 10\%$ ?

d. Assume government spending is  $G$ . Add up the four components of demand and write down the expression for  $D$ .

e. Assume forex market equilibrium is given by  $i = ([1 / E] - 1) + 0.10$ , where the two foreign return terms on the right are expected depreciation and the foreign interest rate. What is the foreign interest rate? What is the expected future exchange rate?

8. [More Difficult] Continuing the last question, solve for the IS curve: obtain an expression for  $Y$  in terms of  $i$ ,  $G$ , and  $T$  (eliminate  $E$ ).
9. Assume that initially the IS curve is given by

$$
I S_{1}: Y = 1 2 - 1. 5 T - 3 0 i + 2 G
$$ and that the price level  $P$  is 1, and the LM curve is given by


$$

L M_{1}: M = Y (1 - i)

$$

The home central bank uses the interest rate as its policy instrument. Initially, the home interest rate equals the foreign interest rate of  $10\%$  or 0.1. Taxes and government spending both equal 2. Call this case 1.

a. According to the  $IS_{1}$  curve, what is the level of output  $Y$ ? Assume this is the desired full-employment level of output.
b. According to the  $LM_{1}$  curve, at this level of output, what is the level of the home money supply?
c. Plot the  $IS_{1}$  and  $LM_{1}$  curves for case 1 on a chart. Label the axes, and the equilibrium values.
d. Assume that forex market equilibrium is given by  $i = ([1 / E] - 1) + 0.10$ , where the two foreign return terms on the right are expected depreciation and the foreign interest rate. The expected future exchange rate is 1. What is today's spot exchange rate?
e. There is now a foreign demand shock, such that the IS curve shifts left by 1.5 units at all levels of the interest rate, and the new IS curve is given by

$$

I S_{2}: Y = 1 0. 5 - 1. 5 T - 3 0 i + 2 G

$$

The government asks the central bank to stabilize the economy at full employment. To stabilize and return output back to the desired level, according to this new IS curve, by how much must the interest rate be lowered from its initial level of 0.1? (Assume taxes and government spending remain at 2.) Call this case 2.

f. At the new lower interest rate and at full employment, on the new LM curve  $(LM_{2})$ , what is the new level of the money supply?

g. According to the forex market equilibrium, what is the new level of the spot exchange rate? How large is the depreciation of the home currency?

h. Plot the new  $IS_{2}$  and  $LM_{2}$  curves for case 2 on a chart. Label the axes, and the equilibrium values.
i. Return to part (e). Now assume that the central bank refuses to change the interest rate from  $10\%$ . In this case, what is the new level of output? What is the money supply? And if the government decides to use fiscal policy instead of stabilize output, then according to the new IS curve, by how much must government spending be increased to achieve this goal? Call this case 3.

j. Plot the new  $IS_{3}$  and  $LM_{3}$  curves for case 3 on a chart. Label the axes, and the equilibrium values.

10. In this chapter, we've studied how policy responses affect economic variables in an open economy. Consider each of the problems in policy design and implementation discussed in this chapter. Compare and contrast each problem as it applies to monetary policy stabilization versus fiscal policy stabilization.

# APPENDIX 1 TO CHAPTER 18

# The Marshall-Lerner Condition

The model developed in this chapter assumes that a depreciation of a country's currency (a rise in  $q$ ) will cause the trade balance to move toward surplus (a rise in  $TB$ ). Is this assumption justified?

Let's look at a simple example. Consider a hypothetical two-country world in which trade is initially balanced, so  $TB = 0$  or  $EX = IM$ . The question of how the trade balance changes then simplifies to a question of whether the change in exports is greater or less than the change in imports. Let us consider a small percentage change in the real exchange rate, say,  $\Delta q / q = +1\%$ , that is, a home real depreciation of  $1\%$ . Note that this is, approximately, a foreign real appreciation of  $1\%$ , since the foreign real exchange rate  $q^{*} = 1 / q$  is simply the inverse of the home real exchange rate, implying that  $\Delta q^{*} / q^{*} = -1\%$ .

As we have argued, when home exports look cheaper to foreigners, the real value of home exports expressed in home units of output will unambiguously rise. This effect is described by the elasticity of home exports with respect to the home real exchange rate, denoted  $\eta$ , where

$$

\frac{\Delta E X}{E X} = \eta \times \frac{\Delta q}{q} = \eta \%

$$

That is, if the home country experiences a  $1\%$  real depreciation, its real exports (measured in home units) rise by  $\eta\%$ .

The same logic applies to the foreign country, with exports  $EX^{*}$ , real exchange rate  $q^{*} = 1 / q$ , and elasticity  $\eta^{*}$ , so that

$$

\frac{\Delta E X^{*}}{E X^{*}} = \eta^{*} \times \frac{\Delta q^{*}}{q^{*}} = \eta^{*} \%

$$

Now consider the trade link between the two countries. Foreign exports must equal home imports, measured in any consistent units. In home, real output units

Home imports in units of home output  $= \underbrace{IM(q)}_{\substack{\text{Homeimports}\\ (\text{real})}}$

Foreign exports in units of home output  $= \underbrace{(1 / P)}_{\substack{\text{Dividebyhome}\\ \text{pricelevelto}\\ \text{converttohome}\\ \text{outputunits}}}\times \underbrace{E}_{\substack{\text{Exchange}\\ \text{rateconverts}\\ \text{foreignto}\\ \text{domestic}\\ \text{currency}}} \times \underbrace{P^{*}}_{\substack{\text{Priceof}\\ \text{foreignbasket}\\ \text{inforeign}\\ \text{currency}}} \times \underbrace{EX^{*}(q^{*})}_{\substack{\text{Foreignexports}\\ \text{(real)}}}$  Value of foreign exports in foreign currency Value of foreign exports in home currency

Equating these two terms, we find that  $IM(q) = (EP^{*} / P)\times EX^{*}(q^{*})$ . Thus,

$$

I M (q) = q \times E X^{*} (q^{*})

$$

This expression makes intuitive sense for the stylized two-country world that we are studying. It states that  $IM$ , the quantity of home imports (measured in home output units), must equal the quantity of foreign exports  $EX^{*}$  (measured in foreign output units) multiplied by a factor  $q$  that converts units of foreign goods to units of home goods (since  $q$  is the relative price of foreign goods, that is home goods per unit of foreign goods).

For a small change, we may write the percentage change in the previous equation as follows. On the left is the percentage change in imports; on the right is the percentage change in  $q$  times  $EX^{*}$ , which equals the percentage change in  $q$  plus the percentage change in  $EX^{*}$ :

$$

\frac{\Delta I M}{I M} = \frac{\Delta q}{q} + \frac{\Delta E X^{*}}{E X^{*}} = \frac{\Delta q}{q} + \left[ \eta^{*} \times \frac{\Delta q^{*}}{q^{*}} \right] = 1 \% + \left[ \eta^{*} \times (- 1 \%) \right] = (1 - \eta^{*}) \%

$$

What is going on here? On the home import side, two effects come into play. Foreigners export a lower volume of their more expensive goods measured in foreign output units (a volume effect of  $-\eta^{*}\%$ ), but those goods will cost more for home importers in terms of home output (a price effect of  $1\%$ ). The price effect follows because the real exchange rate (the relative price of the foreign goods in terms of domestic goods) has increased (by  $1\%$ ), and this makes every unit of imports cost more in real terms.

Starting from balanced trade with  $EX = IM$ , a  $1\%$  home real depreciation will cause  $EX$  to change by  $\eta \%$  and  $IM$  to change by  $1 - \eta^{*}\%$ . The trade balance (initially zero) will increase (to become positive) if and only if the former impact on  $EX$  exceeds the latter impact on  $IM$ . This occurs if and only if  $\eta > 1 - \eta^{*}$ , or, equivalently,

$$

\eta + \eta^{*} > 1

$$

The last expression is known as the Marshall-Lerner condition: it says that the trade balance will increase only after a real depreciation if the responsiveness of trade volumes to real exchange rate changes is sufficiently large (or sufficiently elastic) to ensure that the volume effects exceed the price effects.

# Multilateral Real Exchange Rates

How do the predictions of our model change when a country trades with multiple countries or regions? Can our theory be extended to this more realistic case? Can we make a sensible aggregation of trade flows, trade balances, and real exchange rates across, say,  $N$  different countries?

Suppose that for trade with any foreign country (say, country 1), the fractional change in home exports  $EX_{1}$  and imports  $IM_{1}$  given a small change in the real exchange rate  $q_{1}$  is

$$

\frac{\Delta E X_{1}}{E X_{1}} = \varepsilon \times \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}}; \quad \frac{\Delta I M_{1}}{I M_{1}} = - \varepsilon \times \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}}

$$

The parameter  $\varepsilon > 0$  is an elasticity. In this case, it is the elasticity of exports and imports with respect to the real exchange rate. When  $q$  rises by  $1\%$  (a real depreciation), exports rise by  $\varepsilon\%$ , and imports fall by  $\varepsilon\%$ . (A more complicated analysis is needed when the import and export elasticities differ; see the first appendix.)

From these relationships, we find the following by rearranging:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \Delta T B_{1} = \Delta E X_{1} - \Delta I M_{1} = \varepsilon \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}} E X_{1} + \varepsilon \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}} I M_{1} \\ = \varepsilon \times \left(E X_{1} + I M_{1}\right) \times \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}} \\ = \varepsilon \times \operatorname{Tr ad e}_{1} \times \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}} \\ \end{array}

$$ where  $\mathrm{Trade}_i = [EX_i + IM_i]$  is the total trade of the home country with country  $i$ .

Adding up this last equation across all countries, the change in the home trade balance is given by  $\Delta TB = \Delta TB_{1} + \Delta TB_{2} + \dots +\Delta TB_{N}$ , which we can write as

$$
\Delta T B = \varepsilon \times \left[ \operatorname{Tr ad e}_{1} \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}} + \operatorname{Tr ad e}_{2} \frac{\Delta q_{2}}{q_{2}} + \dots + \operatorname{Tr ad e}_{N} \frac{\Delta q_{N}}{q_{N}} \right]
$$

We normalize by total trade, where  $\mathrm{Trade} = \mathrm{Trade}_1 + \mathrm{Trade}_2 + \dots + \mathrm{Trade}_N$ , to obtain

$$
\Delta T B = \varepsilon \times \text{Tr ad e} \times \left[ \frac{\text{Tr ad e}_{1}}{\text{Tr ad e}} \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}} + \frac{\text{Tr ad e}_{1}}{\text{Tr ad e}} \frac{\Delta q_{2}}{q_{2}} + \dots + \frac{\text{Tr ad e}_{1}}{\text{Tr ad e}} \frac{\Delta q_{N}}{q_{N}} \right]
$$

Trade-weighted average of bilateral real exchange rate changes

The expression in brackets might look familiar. In Chapter 13, we introduced the concept of a trade-weighted change in the nominal exchange rate—the change in the value of a currency against a basket of currencies, where the change in each country-pair's nominal exchange rate was weighted by that particular country-pair's share of trade volume. The preceding expression is similar, only with nominal exchange rates replaced by real exchange rates. The expression shows that (with some assumptions) our model can be extended to more realistic scenarios with many countries by using the change in a trade-weighted real exchange rate covering all trading partners.
