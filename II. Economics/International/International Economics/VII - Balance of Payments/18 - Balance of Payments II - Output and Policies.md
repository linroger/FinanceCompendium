# Fixed Versus Floating: International Monetary Experience

In truth, the gold standard is already a barbarous relic. All of us, from the Governor of the Bank of England downwards, are now primarily interested in preserving the stability of business, prices, and employment, and are not likely, when the choice is forced on us, deliberately to sacrifice these to the outworn dogma… . Advocates of the ancient standard do not observe how remote it now is from the spirit and the requirements of the age.

John Maynard Keynes, 1923

How many more fiascoes will it take before responsible people are finally convinced that a system of pegged exchange rates is not a satisfactory financial arrangement for a group of large countries with independent political systems and independent national policies?

Milton Friedman, 1992

The gold standard in particular—and even pegged exchange rates in general—have a bad name. But the gold standard's having lost her name in the 1920s and 1930s should not lead one to forget her 19th century virtues… . Can these lost long-term virtues be retrieved without the world again being in thrall to the barbarous relic? … In an integrated world economy, the choice of an exchange rate regime—and thus the common price level—should not be left to an individual country. The spillover effects are so high that it should be a matter of collective choice.

Ronald McKinnon, 2002

# A century ago, economists and policy makers may have had their differon, but—unlike today—almost all of them agreed that a fixed exchange deal choice of exchange rate regime. Even if some countries occasionally ting rate, it was usually with the expectation that they would soon return egged rate.

The preferred method for fixing the exchange rate was the gold standard, a system in which the value of a country's currency was fixed relative to an ounce of gold. As a result, the currency's value was also fixed against all other currencies that were

6 Conclusions also pegged to gold. The requirements of maintaining the gold standard were strict: although monetary authorities could issue paper money, they had to be willing and able to exchange paper currency for gold at the official fixed rate when asked to do so.

Figure 19-1 documents 140 years of exchange rate arrangements around the world. From 1870 to 1913, most of the world used the gold standard. At the peak in 1913, approximately  $70\%$  of the world's countries were part of the gold standard system; a few floated (about  $20\%$ ) or used other metallic standards (about  $10\%$ ). Since 1913 much has changed. Adherence to the gold standard weakened during World War I, waxed and waned in the 1920s and 1930s, then was never seen again. In the 1940s, John Maynard Keynes and policy makers from all over the world designed a new system of fixed exchange rates, the Bretton Woods system.

In the period after World War II, the figure shows that many currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar in this system. Other currencies were pegged to the British pound, the French franc, and the German mark. Because the pound, franc, and mark were all pegged to the dollar at this time, the vast majority of the world's currencies were directly or indirectly fixed on what amounted to a "dollar standard" system.

Like the gold standard, the dollar-based system didn't endure either. Beginning in the early 1970s, floating exchange rates became more common (more than  $30\%$  of all

From 1870 to 1913, the gold standard became the dominant regime. During World War I (1914-1918), most countries suspended the gold standard, and resumptions in the late 1920s were brief. After further suspensions in World War II (1939-1945), most countries were fixed against the U.S. dollar (the pound, franc, and mark blocs were indirectly pegged to the dollar). Starting in the 1970s, more countries opted to float. In 1999 the euro replaced the franc and the mark as the base currency for many pegs.

currency regimes in the 1980s and 1990s); in recent years, fixed exchange rates have risen again in prominence. Remember that these data count all countries' currencies equally, without any weighting for economic size (measured by GDP). In the larger economies of the world, and especially among the major currencies, floating regimes are more prevalent.

Why do some countries choose to fix and others to float? Why do they change their minds at different times? These are among the most enduring and controversial questions in international macroeconomics and they have been the cause of conflicts among economists, policy makers, and commentators for many years. On one side of the debate are those like Milton Friedman (quoted at the start of this chapter) who in the 1950s, against the prevailing gold standard orthodoxy, argued that floating rates are obviously to be preferred because of their clear economic and political advantages. On the opposing side of the debate are figures such as Ronald McKinnon (also quoted above) who think that only a system of fixed rates can encourage cooperative policy making, keep prices and output stable, and encourage international flows of trade and finance. In this chapter, we examine the pros and cons of different exchange rate regimes.

# 1 Exchange Rate Regime Choice: Key Issues

In previous chapters, we have examined the workings of the economy under fixed and floating exchange rates. One advantage of understanding the workings of these regimes in such detail is that we are now in a position to address a perennially important macroeconomic policy question: What is the best exchange rate regime choice for a given country at a given time? In this section, we explore the pros and cons of fixed and floating exchange rates by combining the models we have developed with additional theory and evidence. We begin with an application about Germany and Britain in the early 1990s. This story highlights the choices policy makers face as they choose between fixed exchange rates (pegs) and floating exchange rates (floats).

# APPLICATION

# Britain and Europe: The Big Issues

One way to begin to understand the choice between fixed and floating regimes is to look at countries that have sometimes floated and sometimes fixed and to examine their reasons for switching. In this case study, we look at the British decision to switch from an exchange rate peg to floating in September 1992.

We start by asking, why did Britain first adopt a peg? In the 1970s Britain joined what would later become the European Union and the push for a common currency was part of a larger program, political and economic, to create a single market across Europe. Fixed exchange rates, and ultimately a common currency, were seen as a means to promote trade and other forms of cross-border exchange by lowering transaction costs. In addition, British policy makers felt that an exchange rate anchor might help lower British inflation.

The common currency (the euro) did not become a reality until 1999, and only then in a subset of European Union countries; but the journey started in 1979 with the creation of a fixed exchange rate system called the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The ERM tied all member currencies together at fixed rates as a step on the way to the adoption of a single currency. In practice, however, the predominant currency in the ERM was the German mark or Deutsche Mark (DM). What this meant was that in the 1980s and 1990s, the German central bank, the Bundesbank, largely retained its monetary autonomy and had the freedom to set its own money supply levels and nominal interest rates. Other countries in the ERM, or looking to join it, in effect had to unilaterally peg to the DM. The DM acted like the base currency or center currency (or Germany was the base country or center country) in the ERM's fixed exchange rate system.

In 1990, Britain joined the ERM. Based on our analysis of fixed exchange rates in the previous chapter, we can understand the implications of that choice using Figure 19-2. This figure shows the familiar one-country IS-LM-FX diagram for Britain and another IS-LM diagram for the center country, Germany. We treat Britain as the home country and Germany as the foreign country, and denote foreign variables with an asterisk.

Panel (a) shows an IS-LM diagram for Germany, with German output on the horizontal axis and the German DM interest rate on the vertical axis. Panel (b) shows the British IS-LM diagram, with British output on the horizontal axis. Panel (c) shows the British forex market, with the exchange rate in pounds per mark. The vertical axes of panels (b) and (c) show returns in pounds, the home currency.

Initially, we suppose the three diagrams are in equilibrium as follows. In panel (a), at point  $1^{\prime \prime}$ , German output is  $Y_{1}^{*}$  and the DM interest rate  $i_{1}^{*}$ . In panel (b), at point 1, British output is  $Y_{1}$  and the pound interest rate is  $i_{1}$ . In panel (c), at point  $1^{\prime}$ , the pound is pegged to the DM at the fixed rate  $\overline{E}$  and expected depreciation is zero. The trilemma tells us that monetary policy autonomy is lost in Britain: the British interest rate must equal the German interest rate, so there is uncovered interest parity with  $i_{1} = i_{1}^{*}$ .

A Shock in Germany With the scene set, our story begins with a threat to the ERM from an unexpected source. The countries of Eastern Europe began their transition away from Communism, a process that famously began with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After the wall fell, the reunification of East and West Germany was soon under way. Because the economically backward East Germany required significant funds to support social services, pay unemployment benefits, modernize infrastructure, and so on, the reunification imposed large fiscal costs on Germany, but West Germans were willing to pay these costs to see their country united. As we know from the previous chapter, an increase in German government consumption  $G^{*}$  can be represented as a shift to the right in the German IS curve, from  $IS_{1}^{*}$  to  $IS_{2}^{*}$  in panel (a). This shift would have moved the German economy's equilibrium from point  $1^{\prime \prime}$  to point  $3^{\prime \prime}$ . All else equal, the model predicts an increase in German interest rates from  $i_{1}^{*}$  to  $i_{3}^{*}$  and a boom in German output from  $Y_{1}^{*}$  to  $Y_{3}^{*}$ . This was indeed what started to happen.

The next chapter in the story involves the Bundesbank's response to the German government's expansionary fiscal policy. The Bundesbank was afraid that the boom in German output might cause an increase in German rates of inflation, and it wanted

(a) German IS-LM Diagram

Off the Mark: Britain's Departure from the ERM in 1992 In panel (a), German reunification raises German government spending and shifts  $IS^{*}$  out. The German central bank contracts monetary policy,  $LM^{*}$  shifts up, and German output stabilizes at  $Y_{1}^{*}$ . Equilibrium shifts from point  $1^{\prime \prime}$  to point  $2^{\prime \prime}$ , and the German interest rate rises from  $i_{1}^{*}$  to  $i_{2}^{*}$ . In Britain, under a peg, panels (b) and (c) show that foreign returns, FR, rise and so the British domestic return, DR, must rise to  $i_{2} = i_{2}^{*}$ . The German interest rate rise also shifts out Britain's IS curve slightly from  $IS_{1}$  to  $IS_{2}$ . To maintain the peg, Britain's LM curve shifts up from  $LM_{1}$  to  $LM_{2}$ . At the same exchange rate and a higher interest rate, demand falls and output drops from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ . Equilibrium moves from point 1 to point 2. If the British were to float, they could put the LM curve wherever they wanted. For example, at  $LM_{4}$  the British interest rate holds at  $i_{1}$  and output booms, but the forex market ends up at point  $4^{\prime}$  and there is a depreciation of the pound to  $E_{4}$ . The British could also select  $LM_{3}$ , stabilize output at the initial level  $Y_{1}$ , but the peg still has to break with  $E$  rising to  $E_{3}$ .

to avoid that outcome. Using its policy autonomy, the Bundesbank tightened its monetary policy by contracting the money supply and raising interest rates. This policy change is seen in the upward shift of the German LM curve, from  $LM_{1}^{*}$  to  $LM_{2}^{*}$  in panel (a). We suppose that the Bundesbank stabilizes German output at its initial level  $Y_{1}^{*}$  by raising German interest rates to the even higher level of  $i_{2}^{*3}$ .

Choices for the Other ERM Countries What happened in the countries of the ERM that were pegging to the DM? We examine what these events implied for Britain, but the other ERM members faced the same problems. The IS-LM-FX model tells us that events in Germany have two implications for the British IS-LM-FX model. First, as the German interest rate  $i^{*}$  rises, the British foreign return curve FR shifts up in the British forex market (to recap: German deposits pay higher interest, all else equal). Second, as the German interest rate  $i^{*}$  rises, the British IS curve shifts out (to recap: at any given British interest rate, the pound has to depreciate more, boosting British demand via expenditure switching). Now we only have to figure out how much the British IS curve shifts, what the British LM curve is up to, and hence how the equilibrium outcome depends on British policy choices.

Choice 1: Float and Prosper? First, let us suppose that in response to the increase in the German interest rate  $i^{*}$ , the Bank of England had left British interest rates unchanged at  $i_{1}$  and suppose British fiscal policy had also been left unchanged. In addition, let's assume that Britain would have allowed the pound-DM exchange rate to float in the short run. For simplicity we also assume that in the long run, the expected exchange rate remains unchanged, so that the long-run future expected exchange rate  $E^{e}$  remains unchanged at  $\overline{E}$ .

With these assumptions in place, let's look at what happens to the investment component of demand: in Britain,  $I$  would be unchanged at  $I(i_1)$ . In the forex market in panel (c), the Bank of England, as assumed, holds the domestic return  $DR_1$  constant at  $i_1$ . With the foreign return rising from  $FR_1$  to  $FR_2$  and the domestic return constant at  $DR_1$ , the new equilibrium would be at  $4'$  and the British exchange rate rises temporarily to  $E_4$ . Thus, if the Bank of England doesn't act, the pound would have to depreciate to  $E_4$  against the DM; it would float, contrary to the ERM rules.

Now think about the effects of this depreciation on the trade balance component of demand: the British trade balance would rise because a nominal depreciation is also a real depreciation in the short run, given sticky prices. As we saw in the previous chapter, British demand would therefore increase, as would British equilibrium output.

To sum up the result after all these adjustments occur, an increase in the foreign interest rate always shifts out the home IS curve, all else equal as shown in panel (b): British interest rates would still be at  $i_1$ , and British output would have risen to  $Y_4$ , on the new IS curve  $IS_2$ . To keep the interest rate at  $i_1$ , as output rises, the Bank of England would have had to expand its money supply, shifting the British LM curve from  $LM_1$  to  $LM_4$ , and causing the pound to depreciate to  $E_4$ . If Britain were to float and depreciate the pound, it would experience a boom. But this would not have been compatible with Britain's continued ERM membership.

Choice 2: Peg and Suffer? If Britain's exchange rate were to stay pegged to the DM because of the ERM, however, the outcome for Britain would not be so rosy. In this scenario, the trilemma means that to maintain the peg, Britain would have to increase its interest rate and follow the lead of the center country, Germany. In panel (b), the pound interest rate would have to rise to the level  $i_{2} = i_{2}^{*}$  to maintain the peg. In panel (c), the domestic return would rise from  $DR_{1}$  to  $DR_{2}$  in step with the foreign return's rise from  $FR_{1}$  to  $FR_{2}$ , and the new FX market equilibrium would be at  $2'$ . The Bank of England would accomplish this rise in DR by tightening its monetary policy and lowering the British money supply. In panel (b), under a peg, the new position of the IS curve at  $IS_2$  would imply an upward shift in the British LM curve, as shown by the move from  $LM_1$  to  $LM_2$ . So the British IS-LM equilibrium would now be at point 2, with output at  $Y_2$ . The adverse consequences for the British economy now become apparent. At point 2, as compared with the initial point 1, British demand has fallen. Why? British interest rates have risen (depressing investment demand  $I$ ), but the exchange rate has remained at its pegged level  $\overline{E}$  (so there is no change in the trade balance). To sum up, what we have shown in this scenario is that the IS curve may have moved right a bit, but the opposing shift in the LM curve would have been even larger. If Britain were to stay pegged and keep its membership in the ERM, Britain would experience a recession.

In 1992 Britain found itself facing a decision between these two choices. As we have noted, if the British pound had been floating against the DM, then leaving interest rates unchanged would have been an option, and Britain could have achieved equilibrium at point 4 with a higher output,  $Y_{4}$ . In fact, floating would have opened up the whole range of monetary policy options. For example, Britain could have chosen a mild monetary contraction by shifting the British LM curve from  $LM_{1}$  to  $LM_{3}$ , moving equilibrium in panel (b) to point 3, stabilizing U.K. output at its initial level  $Y_{1}$ , and allowing the FX market in panel (c) to settle at point  $3'$  with a mild depreciation of the exchange rate to  $E_{3}$ .

What Happened Next? In September 1992, after an economic slowdown and after considerable last-minute dithering and turmoil, the British Conservative government finally decided that the benefits to Britain of being in ERM and the euro project were smaller than the costs suffered as a result of a German interest-rate hike in response to Germany-specific events. Two years after joining the ERM, Britain opted out.

Did Britain make the right choice? In Figure 19-3, we compare the economic performance of Britain with that of France, a large European Union economy that

Floating Away: Britain Versus France after 1992 Britain's decision to exit the ERM allowed for more expansionary British monetary policy after September 1992.

Consistent with the model, the data show lower interest rates, a more depreciated currency, and faster output growth in Britain compared with France after 1992.

Most Britons are opposed to the euro, some vehemently so.

maintained its ERM peg. After leaving the ERM in September 1992, Britain lowered interest rates [panel (a)] in the short run and depreciated its exchange rate against the DM [panel (b)]. In comparison, France never depreciated and had to maintain higher interest rates to keep the franc pegged to the DM until German monetary policy eased a year or two later. As our model would predict, the British economy boomed in subsequent years panel (c). The French suffered slower growth, a fate shared by most of the other countries that stayed in the ERM.

The British choice stands to this day. Although the option to rejoin the ERM has remained open since

1992, the idea of pegging to (much less joining) the euro is unpopular in Britain. All subsequent British governments have decided that the benefits of increased trade and economic integration with Europe were smaller than the associated costs of sacrificing British monetary autonomy.[5]

# Key Factors in Exchange Rate Regime Choice: Integration and Similarity

We started this chapter with an application about the policy choice and tradeoffs. Britain faced in 1992 when it needed to decide between a fixed exchange rate (peg) and a floating exchange rate (float).

At different times, British authorities could see the potential benefits of participating fully in an economically integrated single European market and the ERM fixed exchange rate system. The fixed exchange rate, for example, would lower the costs of economic transactions among the members of the ERM zone. But, especially in 1992, the British could also see that there would be times when the monetary policy being pursued by authorities in Germany would be out of line with policy that was best for Britain. The fundamental source of this divergence between what Britain wanted and what Germany wanted was that each country faced different shocks. The fiscal shock that Germany experienced after reunification was not felt in Britain or any other ERM country.

To better understand these trade-offs, and the decision to fix or float, we now examine the issues that are at the heart of this decision: economic integration as measured by trade and other transactions, and economic similarity, as measured by the similarity of shocks.

# Economic Integration and the Gains in Efficiency

The term economic integration refers to the growth of market linkages in goods, capital, and labor markets among regions and countries. By lowering transaction costs, a fixed exchange rate might promote integration and increase economic efficiency.

Trade is the clearest example of an activity that volatile exchange rates might discourage. Stable exchange rates and prices encourage arbitrage and lower the costs of trade. But trade is not the only type of international economic activity likely to be discouraged by exchange rate fluctuations. Currency-related transaction costs and uncertainty also act as barriers to cross-border capital and labor flows.

The lesson: the greater the degree of economic integration between markets in the home country and the base country, the greater will be the volume of transactions between the two, and the greater will be the benefits the home country gains from fixing its exchange rate with the base country. As integration rises, the efficiency benefits of having a fixed exchange rate increase.

# Economic Similarity and the Costs of Asymmetric Shocks

A fixed exchange rate can lead to costs when one country experiences a country-specific shock or asymmetric shock that is not shared by the other country.

The application on Britain and Germany showed why an asymmetric shock causes problems: it leads to a conflict between the policy goals of the two countries. In our example, German policy makers wanted to tighten monetary policy to offset a boom caused by a positive demand shock due to their expansionary fiscal policy. British policy makers did not want to implement the same policy: because they had not experienced the same shock, following the German monetary policy would have caused a recession in Britain.

Similar or symmetric shocks do not cause such problems. Imagine that Germany and Britain experience an identical expansionary demand shock. In this case, German and British monetary authorities would respond identically, raising interest rates by the same amount to stabilize output. This desired symmetric increase in interest rates does not conflict with Britain's fixed exchange rate commitment. If interest rates were initially set at a common level,  $i_1 = i_1^*$ , they would be raised to a new higher level,  $i_2 = i_2^*$ . By raising its rates, Britain could stabilize output and stay pegged because uncovered interest parity is still satisfied. The exchange rate  $\overline{E}$  does not change, and even though Britain is pegging unilaterally to Germany, Britain has the interest rate it would choose even if it were floating and could make an independent monetary policy choice.

When a Home country unilaterally pegs to a Foreign country, asymmetric shocks impose costs on the home country in terms of lost output. When asymmetric shocks hit, the monetary policies that are best for Foreign and for Home will differ, and the peg means that Foreign's policy choice will automatically be imposed on Home. In contrast, symmetric shocks do not impose any costs because the monetary policies that Foreign and Home want to pursue will be the same, and Foreign's imposed choice will suit Home perfectly.

Real-world situations are more complex. Countries are not identical and shocks may be a mix of large and small, symmetric and asymmetric shocks.

- The lesson: if there is a greater degree of economic similarity between the home country and the base country (that is, if they face more symmetric shocks and fewer asymmetric shocks), then the economic stabilization costs to home of fixing its exchange rate to the base are smaller. As economic similarity rises, the stability costs of having a fixed exchange rate decrease.

# Simple Criteria for a Fixed Exchange Rate

We can now set out a theory of exchange rate regime choice by considering the net benefits (benefits minus the costs) of pegging versus floating. Our discussions about integration and similarity have shown the following:

As integration rises, the efficiency benefits of a fixed exchange rate increase.

As symmetry rises, the stability costs of a fixed exchange rate decrease.

Our theory says that if market integration or symmetry increases, the net benefits of a fixed exchange rate also increase. If the net benefits are negative, the home country should float if the decision is based solely on its economic interests. If the net benefits are positive, the home country should fix.

Figure 19-4 illustrates the theory in a symmetry-integration diagram in which the horizontal axis measures the degree of economic integration between a pair of locations, say, A and B, and the vertical axis measures the symmetry of the shocks experienced by the pair A and B.

We use the figure to see whether A should peg unilaterally to B (or vice versa). Suppose conditions change and the pair moves up and to the right, for example, from point 1 toward point 6. Along this path, integration and symmetry are both increasing, so the net benefits of fixing are also increasing. At some critical point (point 2 in the graph), the net benefits turn positive. Before that point, floating is best. After that point, fixing is best.

FIGURE 19-4

A Theory of Fixed Exchange Rates Points 1 to 6 in the figure represent a pair of locations. Suppose one location is considering pegging its exchange rate to its partner. If their markets become more integrated (a move to the right along the horizontal axis) or if the economic shocks they experience become more symmetric (a move up on the vertical axis), the net economic benefits of fixing increase. If the pair moves far enough up or to the right, then the benefits of fixing exceed costs (net benefits are positive), and the pair will cross the fixing threshold shown by the FIX line. Above the line, it is optimal for the region to fix. Below the line, it is optimal for the region to float.

Our argument is more general: whatever the direction of the path, as long as it moves up and to the right, it must cross some threshold like point 2 beyond which benefits outweigh costs. Thus, there will exist a set of points—a downward-sloping line passing through point 2—that delineates this threshold. We refer to this threshold as the FIX line. Points above the FIX line satisfy the economic criteria for a fixed exchange rate.

What might different points on this chart mean? If we are at point 6, we might think of A and B as neighborhoods in a city—they are very well integrated and an economic shock is usually felt by all neighborhoods in the city. If A and B were at point 5, they might be two cities. If A and B were at point 4, they might be the regions of a country, and still above the FIX line. If A and B were at point 3, they might be neighboring, well-integrated countries with few asymmetric shocks. Point 2 is right on the borderline. If A and B were at point 1, they might be less well-integrated countries with more asymmetric shocks and our theory says they should float.

The key prediction of our theory is this: pairs of countries above the FIX line (more integrated, more similar shocks) will gain economically from adopting a fixed exchange rate. Those below the FIX line (less integrated, less similar shocks) will not.

In a moment, we develop and apply this theory further. But first, let's see if there is evidence to support the theory's two main assumptions: Do fixed exchange rates deliver trade gains through integration? Do they impose stability costs by limiting monetary policy options?

# Do Fixed Exchange Rates Promote Trade?

The single most powerful argument for a fixed exchange rate is that it may boost trade by eliminating trade-hindering costs. The idea is an old one. In 1878, the United States had yet to re-adopt the gold standard following the Civil War. Policy makers were debating whether going back on gold made sense, and J. S. Moore, a U.S. Treasury official testifying before Congress, was questioned on the subject:

Question: Do you not think that the use of a common standard of value has a tendency to promote a free commercial interchange between the various countries using it?

Answer: If two countries, be they ever so distant from each other, should have the same standard of money … there would be no greater harmonizer than such an exchange.

Benefits Measured by Trade Levels As we have noted, this was the conventional wisdom among policy makers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and research by economic historians has found strong support for their views: all else equal, two countries adopting the gold standard had bilateral trade levels  $30\%$  to  $100\%$  higher than comparable pairs of countries that were off the gold standard.6 Thus, it appears that the gold standard did promote trade.

What about fixed exchange rates today? Do they promote trade? Economists have exhaustively tested this hypothesis using increasingly sophisticated statistical methods. We can look at some evidence from a recent study in which country pairs A-B were classified in four different ways: a. The two countries are using a common currency (i.e., A and B are in a currency union or A has unilaterally adopted B's currency).

b. The two countries are linked by a direct exchange rate peg (i.e., A's currency is pegged to B's).

c. The two countries are linked by an indirect exchange rate peg, via a third currency (i.e., A and B have currencies pegged to C but not directly to each other).

d. The two countries are not linked by any type of peg (i.e., their currencies float against each other, even if one or both might be pegged to some other third currency).

Using this classification and trade data from 1973 to 1999, economists Jay Shambaugh and Michael Klein compared bilateral trade volumes for all pairs under the three pegged regimes (a) through (c) with the benchmark level of trade under a floating regime (d) to see if there were any systematic differences. They also used careful statistical techniques to control for other factors and to address possible reverse causality (that is, to eliminate the possibility that higher trade might have caused countries to fix their exchange rates). Figure 19-5 shows their key estimates, according to which currency unions increased bilateral trade by  $38\%$  relative to floating regimes. They also found that the adoption of a fixed exchange rate would promote trade, but only for the case of direct pegs. Adopting a direct peg increased bilateral trade by  $21\%$  compared with a floating exchange rate. Indirect pegs had a negligible and statistically insignificant effect.

The chart shows one study's estimates of the impact on trade volumes of various types of fixed exchange rate regimes, relative to a floating exchange rate regime. Indirect pegs were found to have a small but statistically insignificant impact on trade, but trade increased under a direct peg by  $21\%$ , and under a currency union by  $38\%$ , as compared with floating.

Benefits Measured by Price Convergence The effect of exchange rate regimes on trade levels is one way to evaluate the impact of currency arrangements on international market integration, and it has been extensively researched. Another body of research examines the relationship between exchange rate regimes and price convergence. These studies use the law of one price (LOOP) and purchasing power parity (PPP) as criteria for measuring market integration. If fixed exchange rates promote trade by lowering transaction costs, then differences between prices (measured in a common currency) should be smaller among countries with pegged rates than among countries with floating rates. In other words, LOOP and PPP should be more likely to hold under a fixed exchange rate than under a floating regime. (Recall that price convergence underlies the gains-from-trade argument.)

Statistical methods can be used to detect how large price differences must be between two locations before arbitrage begins. Research on prices of baskets of goods shows that as exchange rate volatility increases (as it does when currencies float), price differences widen, and the speed at which prices in the two markets converge decreases. These findings offer support for the hypothesis that fixed exchange rates promote arbitrage and price convergence.[8]

Economists have also studied convergence in the prices of individual goods. For example, several studies focused on Europe have looked at the prices of various goods in different countries (e.g., retail prices of cars and TV sets, and the prices of Marlboro cigarettes in duty-free shops). These studies showed that higher exchange rate volatility is associated with larger price differences between locations. In particular, while price gaps still remain for many goods, the "in" countries (members of the ERM and now the Eurozone) saw prices converge much more than the "out" countries.[9]

# APPLICATION

# Do Fixed Exchange Rates Diminish Monetary Autonomy and Stability?

Probably the single most powerful argument against a fixed exchange rate is provided by the trilemma. An economy that unilaterally pegs to a foreign currency sacrifices its monetary policy autonomy.

We have seen the result many times now. If capital markets are open, arbitrage in the forex market implies uncovered interest parity. If the exchange rate is fixed, expected depreciation is zero, and the home interest rate must equal the foreign interest rate. The stark implication is that when a country pegs, it relinquishes its independent monetary policy: it has to adjust the money supply  $M$  at all times to ensure that the home interest rate  $i$  equals the foreign interest rate  $i^{*}$  (plus any risk premium).

The preceding case study of Britain and the ERM is one more example: Britain wanted to decouple the British interest rate from the German interest rate. To do so, it had to stop pegging the pound to the German mark. Once it had done that, instead of having to contract the British economy as a result of unrelated events in Germany, it could maintain whatever interest rate it thought was best suited to British economic interests.

The Trilemma, Policy Constraints, and Interest Rate Correlations Is the trilemma truly a binding constraint? Economist Jay Shambaugh tested this proposition, and Figure 19-6 shows some evidence using his data. As we have seen, there are three main solutions to the trilemma. A country can do the following:

1. Opt for open capital markets, with fixed exchange rates (an "open peg").
2. Opt to open its capital market but allow the currency to float (an "open nonpeg").
3. Opt to close its capital markets ("closed").

In case 1, changes in the country's interest rate should match changes in the interest rate of the base country to which it is pegging. In cases 2 and 3, there is no need for the country's interest rate to move in step with the base.

The Trilemma in Action The trilemma says that if the home country is an open peg, it sacrifices monetary policy autonomy because changes in its own interest rate must match changes in the interest rate of the base country. Panel (a) shows that this is the case. The trilemma also says that there are two ways to get that autonomy back: switch to a floating exchange rate or impose capital controls. Panels (b) and (c) show that either of these two policies permits home interest rates to move more independently of the base country.

Notes: ** Statistically significant at 1\% level. * Statistically significant at 5\% level. Hyperinflations excluded.

Figure 19-6 displays evidence for the trilemma. On the vertical axis is the annual change in the domestic interest rate; on the horizontal axis is the annual change in the base country interest rate. The trilemma says that in an open peg the two changes should be same and the points should lie on the 45-degree line. Indeed, for open pegs, shown in panel (a), the correlation of domestic and base interest rates is high and the line of best fit has a slope very close to 1. There are some deviations (possibly due to some pegs being more like bands), but these findings show that open pegs have very little monetary policy autonomy. In contrast, for the open nonpegs, shown in panel (b), and closed economies, shown in panel (c), domestic interest rates do not move as much in line with the base interest rate, the correlation is weak, and the slopes are much smaller than 1. These two regimes allow for some monetary policy autonomy.[10]

Costs of Fixing Measured by Output Volatility The preceding evidence suggests that nations with open pegs have less monetary independence. But it does not tell us directly whether they suffer from greater output instability because their monetary authorities cannot use monetary policy to stabilize output when shocks hit. Some studies have found that, on average, the volatility of output growth is much higher under fixed regimes.[11] However, a problem in such studies is that countries often differ in all kinds of characteristics that may affect output volatility, not just the exchange rate regime—and the results can be sensitive to how one controls for all these other factors.[12]

In the search for cleaner evidence, some recent research has focused on a key prediction of the IS-LM-FX model: all else equal, an increase in the base-country interest rate should cause output to fall in a country that fixes its exchange rate to the base country. This decline in output occurs because countries that fix have to tighten their monetary policy and raise their interest rate to match that of the base country. In contrast, countries that float do not have to follow the base country's rate increase and can use their monetary policy autonomy to stabilize output, by lowering their interest rate and/or allowing their currency to depreciate. Economists Julian di Giovanni and Jay Shambaugh looked at changes in base-country interest rates (say, the U.S. dollar or euro rates) and examined the correlation of these base interest rate changes with changes in GDP in a large sample of fixed and floating nonbase countries. The results, shown in Figure 19-7, confirm the theory's predictions: when a base country increases

10 The correlation isn't perfect for open pegs, nor is it zero for the other cases. This may not be surprising. Pegs are defined as fixed if they vary within a  $\pm 2\%$  band. The band allows central banks a little flexibility with their exchange rates and interest rates that would be lacking in a strict peg (a band of zero width). As for nonpegs and closed countries, there may be reasons why their correlation with the base isn't zero. For example, they may have inflation targets or other monetary policy guidelines that cause their interest rates to follow paths similar to those of the base country. In other words, these countries may be able to change their interest rates a great deal, but how much they choose to change them is another matter. 11 Atish R. Ghosh, Anne-Marie Gulde, Jonathan D.

FIGURE 19-7

Output Costs of Fixed Exchange Rates Recent empirical work finds that shocks which raise base country interest rates are associated with large output losses in countries that fix their currencies to the base, but not in countries that float. For example, as seen here, when a base country raises its interest rate by one percentage point, a country that floats experiences an average increase in its real GDP growth rate of  $0.05\%$  (not statistically significantly different from zero), whereas a country that fixes its real GDP growth rate slow on average by a significant  $0.12\%$ .

its interest rate, it spreads economic pain to those countries pegging to it, but not to the countries that float. These findings confirm that one cost of a fixed exchange rate regime is a more volatile level of output.

# 2 Other Benefits of Fixing

We began the chapter by emphasizing two key factors that influence the choice of fixed versus floating rate regimes: economic integration (market linkages) and economic similarity (symmetry of shocks). Other factors can play a role, however, and in this section, we explore some benefits of a fixed exchange rate regime that can be particularly important in emerging markets and developing countries.

# Fiscal Discipline, Seigniorage, and Inflation

One common argument in favor of fixed exchange rate regimes in developing countries is that an exchange rate peg prevents the government from printing money to finance government expenditure. Under such a financing scheme, the central bank is called upon to monetize the government's deficit (i.e., give money to the government in exchange for debt). This process increases the money supply and leads to high inflation. The source of the government's revenue is, in effect, an inflation tax (called seigniorage) levied on the members of the public who hold money (see Side Bar: The Inflation Tax).

# SIDE BAR

# The Inflation Tax

How does the inflation tax work? Consider a situation in which a country with a floating exchange rate faces a constant budget deficit and is unable to finance this deficit through domestic or foreign borrowing. To cover the deficit, the treasury department calls on the central bank to "monetize" the deficit by purchasing an amount of government bonds equal to the deficit.

For simplicity, suppose output is fixed at  $Y$ , prices are completely flexible, and inflation and the nominal interest rate are constant. At any instant, money grows at a rate  $\Delta M / M = \Delta P / P = \pi$ , so the price level rises at a rate of inflation  $\pi$  equal to the rate of money growth. The Fisher effect tells us that the nominal interest rate is  $i = r^{*} + \pi$ , where  $r^{*}$  is the real world interest rate.

This ongoing inflation erodes the real value of money held by households. If a household holds  $M / P$  in real money balances, then a moment later when prices have increased by an amount  $\Delta M / M = \Delta P / P = \pi$ , a fraction  $\pi$  of the real value of the original  $M / P$  is lost to inflation. The cost of the inflation tax to the household is  $\pi \times M / P$ . For example, if I hold  \$100, the price level is currently 1, and inflation is 1\%$ , then after one period the initial 100 is worth only 99 in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, and prices are 1.01.

What is the inflation tax worth to the government? It can spend the extra money printed  $\Delta M$  to buy real goods and services worth  $\Delta M / P = (\Delta M / M) \times (M / P) = \pi \times (M / P)$ . For the preceding example, the expansion of the money supply from  $100 to$ 101, provides financing worth 1 to the government. The real gain for the government equals the real loss to the households.

The amount that the inflation tax transfers from household to the government is called seigniorage, which can be written as

$$
\underbrace {\text {S e i g n i o r a g e}} _ {\text {I n f l a t i o n t a x}} = \underset {\text {T a x r a t e}} {\pi} \times \underset {\text {T a x b a s e}} {\frac {M}{P}} = \pi \times L (r ^ {*} + \pi) Y
$$

The two terms are often viewed as the tax rate (here, the inflation rate  $\pi$ ) and the tax base (the thing being taxed; here, real money balances  $M / P = L$ ). The first term rises as inflation  $\pi$  rises, but the second term goes to zero as  $\pi$  gets large because if inflation becomes very high, people try to hold almost no money, that is, real money demand given by  $L(i) = L(r^{*} + \pi)Y$  falls to zero.

Because of these two offsetting effects, the inflation tax tends to hit diminishing returns as a source of real revenue: as inflation increases, the tax generates increasing real revenues at first, but eventually the rise in the first term is overwhelmed by the fall in the second term. Once a country is in a hyperinflation, the economy is usually well beyond the point at which real inflation tax revenues are maximized.

High inflation and hyperinflation (inflation in excess of  $50\%$  per month) are undesirable. If nothing else (such as fiscal discipline) can prevent them, a fixed exchange rate may start to look more attractive. Does a fixed exchange rate rule out inflationary finance and the abuse of seigniorage by the government? In principle, yes, but this anti-inflationary effect is not unique to a fixed exchange rate. As we saw in an earlier chapter on the monetary approach to exchange rates, any nominal anchor (such as money, exchange rate, or inflation targets) will have the same effect.

If a country's currency floats, its central bank can print a lot or a little money, with very different inflation outcomes. If a country's currency is pegged, the central bank might run the peg well, with fairly stable prices, or it might run the peg so badly that a crisis occurs, the exchange rate collapses, and inflation erupts.

Nominal anchors imply a "promise" by the government to ensure certain monetary policy outcomes in the long run. However, these promises do not guarantee that the country will achieve these outcomes. All policy announcements including a fixed exchange rate are to some extent "cheap talk." If pressure from the treasury to monetize deficits gets too strong, the commitment to any kind of anchor could fail.

The debate over whether fixed exchange rates improve inflation performance cannot be settled by theory alone—it is an empirical question. What has happened in reality? Table 19-1 lays out the evidence on the world inflation performance from 1970 to 1999. Average inflation rates are computed for all countries and for subgroups of countries:

<table><tr><td colspan="5">TABLE 19-1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Inflation Performance and the Exchange Rate Regime Cross-country annual data from the period 1970 to 1999 can be used to explore the relationship, if any, between the exchange rate regime and the inflation performance of an economy. Floating is associated with slightly lower inflation in the world as a whole (9.9\%) and in the advanced countries (3.5\%) (columns 1 and 2).

For all countries (column 1), we can see that average inflation performance appears largely unrelated to the exchange rate regime, whether the choice is a peg  $(17.4\%)$ , limited flexibility  $(11.1\%)$ , managed floating  $(14.0\%)$ , or freely floating  $(9.9\%)$ . Only the "freely falling" has astronomical rates of inflation  $(387.8\%)$ . Similar results hold for the advanced countries (column 2) and for the emerging markets and developing countries (column 3). Although average inflation rates are higher in the latter sample, the first four regimes have fairly similar inflation rates, with fixed and freely floating almost the same.

We may conclude that as long as monetary policy is guided by some kind of nominal anchor, the particular choice of fixed and floating may not matter that much.13 Possibly the only place where the old conventional wisdom remains intact is in the developing countries, where fixed exchange rates can help to deliver lower inflation rates after high inflations or hyperinflations. Why? In those situations, people may need to see the government tie its own hands in a very open and verifiable way for expectations of perpetually high inflation to be lowered, and a peg is one way to do that. This can be seen in Table 19-1, column 4. If we exclude the first year after a change in the exchange rate regime, we exclude the periods after high inflations and hyperinflations when inflation (and inflationary expectations) may still persist even after the monetary and exchange rate policies have changed. Once things settle down in years two and later, fixed exchange rates generally do deliver lower (single-digit) inflation rates than other regimes.

The lesson: Fixed exchange rates are neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure good inflation performance in many countries. In developing countries beset by high inflation, an exchange rate peg may be the only credible anchor.

# Liability Dollarization, National Wealth, and Contractionary Depreciations

As we learned in the balance of payments chapter, exchange rate changes can have a big effect on a nation's wealth. External assets and liabilities are never entirely denominated in local currency, so movements in the exchange rate can affect their value. For developing countries and emerging markets afflicted by the problem of liability dollarization, the wealth effects can be large and destabilizing, providing another argument for fixing the exchange rate.

Suppose there are just two countries and two currencies, Home and Foreign. Home has external assets  $A_{H}$  denominated in Home currency (say, pesos) and  $A_{F}$  denominated in Foreign currency (say, U.S. dollars). Similarly, it has external liabilities  $L_{H}$  denominated in Home currency and  $L_{F}$  denominated in Foreign currency. The nominal exchange rate is  $E$  (with the units being Home currency per unit of Foreign currency—here, pesos per dollar).

The value of Home's dollar external assets and liabilities can be expressed in pesos as  $EA_{F}$  and  $EL_{F}$ , respectively, using an exchange rate conversion. Hence, the Home country's total external wealth is the sum total of assets minus liabilities expressed in local currency:

$$
W = \underbrace {(A _ {H} + E A _ {F})} _ {\text {A s s e t s}} - \underbrace {(L _ {H} + E L _ {F})} _ {\text {L i a b i l i t i e s}}
$$

Now suppose there is a small change  $\Delta E$  in the exchange rate, all else equal. This does not affect the values of  $A_H$  and  $L_H$ , but it does change the values of  $EA_F$  and  $EL_F$  expressed in pesos. We can express the resulting change in national wealth as

$$
\Delta W = \underbrace {\Delta E} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n}} \times \underbrace {[ A _ {F} - L _ {F} ]} _ {\text {N e t i n t e r n a t i o n}} \tag {19-1}
$$

The expression is intuitive and revealing. After a depreciation  $(\Delta E > 0)$ , the wealth effect is positive if Foreign currency assets exceed Foreign currency liabilities (the net dollar position in brackets is positive) and negative if Foreign currency liabilities exceed Foreign currency assets (the net dollar position in brackets is negative).

For example, consider first the case in which Home experiences a 10\% depreciation, with assets of 100 billion and liabilities of 100 billion. What happens to Home wealth if it has \$50 billion of assets in dollars and no liabilities in dollars? It has a net credit position in dollars, so it ought to gain. Half of assets and all liabilities are expressed in pesos, so their value does not change. But the value of the half of assets denominated in dollars will rise in peso terms by 10\% times 50 billion. In this case, a 10\% depreciation increases national wealth by 5\% or \$5 billion because it increases the value of a net foreign currency credit position.

Now look at the case in which Home experiences a  $10\%$  depreciation, as in the preceding example, with zero assets in dollars and 50 billion of liabilities in dollars. All assets and half of liabilities are expressed in pesos, so their value does not change.

But the value of the half of liabilities denominated in dollars will rise in peso terms by  $10\%$  times  $\$ 50$  billion. In this case, a depreciation decreases national wealth by  $5\%$  or  $\$ 5$  billion because it increases the value of a net foreign currency debit position.

Destabilizing Wealth Shocks Why do these wealth effects have implications for stabilization policy? In the previous chapter, we saw that nominal exchange rate depreciation can be used as a short-run stabilization tool in the IS-LM-FX model. In the face of an adverse demand shock in the Home country, for example, a depreciation will increase Home aggregate demand by switching expenditure toward Home goods. Now we can see that exchange rate movements can influence aggregate demand by affecting wealth.

These effects matter because, in more complex short-run models of the economy, wealth affects the demand for goods. For example,

Consumers might spend more when they have more wealth. In this case, the consumption function would become  $C(Y - T, \text{Total wealth})$ , and consumption would depend not just on after-tax income but also on wealth.

Firms might find it easier to borrow if their wealth increases (e.g., wealth increases the net worth of firms, increasing the collateral available for loans). The investment function would then become  $I(i, \text{Total wealth})$ , and investment would depend on both the interest rate and wealth.

We can now begin to understand the importance of the exchange rate valuation effects summarized in Equation (19-1). This equation says that countries have to satisfy a special condition to avoid changes in external wealth whenever the exchange rate moves: the value of their foreign currency external assets must exactly equal foreign currency liabilities. If foreign currency external assets do not equal foreign currency external liabilities, the country is said to have a currency mismatch on its external balance sheet, and exchange rate changes will affect national wealth.

If foreign currency assets exceed foreign currency liabilities, then the country experiences an increase in wealth when the exchange rate depreciates. From the point of view of stabilization, this is likely to be beneficial: additional wealth will complement the direct stimulus to aggregate demand caused by a depreciation, making the effect of the depreciation even more expansionary. This scenario applies to only a few countries, most notably the United States.

However, if foreign currency liabilities exceed foreign currency assets, a country will experience a decrease in wealth when the exchange rate depreciates. From the point of view of stabilization policy, this wealth effect is unhelpful because the fall in wealth will tend to offset the conventional stimulus to aggregate demand caused by a depreciation. In principle, if the valuation effects are large enough, the overall effect of a depreciation can be contractionary! For example, while an interest rate cut might boost investment, and the ensuing depreciation might also boost the trade balance, such upward pressure on aggregate demand may well be offset partially or fully (or even outweighed) by decreases in wealth that put downward pressure on demand.

We now see that if a country has an adverse (i.e., negative) net position in foreign currency assets, then the conventional arguments for stabilization policy (and the need for floating) are weak. For many emerging market and developing economies, this is a serious problem. Most of these poorer countries are net debtors, so their external wealth shows a net debit position overall. But their net position in foreign currency is often just as much in debit, or even more so, because their liabilities are often close to  $100\%$  dollarized.

Evidence Based on Changes in Wealth When emerging markets experience large depreciations, they often suffer serious collapses in external wealth. To illustrate the severity of this problem, Figure 19-8 shows the impact of exchange rate valuation effects on wealth in eight countries. All the countries experienced exchange rate crises during the period in which the domestic currency lost much of its value relative to the U.S. dollar. Following the 1997 Asian crisis, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand saw their currencies depreciate by about  $50\%$ ; Indonesia's currency depreciated by  $75\%$ . In 1999 the Brazilian real depreciated by almost  $50\%$ . In 2001 Turkey's lira depreciated suddenly by about  $50\%$ , after a long slide. And in Argentina, the peso depreciated by about  $75\%$  in 2002.

All of these countries also had large exposure to foreign currency debt with large levels of currency mismatch. The Asian countries had borrowed extensively in yen and U.S. dollars; Turkey, Brazil, and Argentina had borrowed extensively in U.S. dollars. As a result of the valuation effects of the depreciations and the liability dollarization all of these countries saw large declines in external wealth. Countries such as Brazil and Korea escaped lightly, with wealth falling cumulatively by only  $5\%$  to  $10\%$  of annual GDP. Countries with larger exposure to foreign currency debt, or with larger depreciations, suffered much more: in Argentina, the Philippines, and Thailand, the losses were  $20\%$  to  $30\%$  of GDP and in Indonesia almost  $40\%$  of GDP.

Evidence Based on Output Contractions Figure 19-8 tells us that countries with large liability dollarization suffered large wealth effects. But do these wealth effects cause so much economic damage that a country might reconsider its exchange rate regime?

Figure 19-9 suggests that wealth effects are associated with contractions and that the damage is fairly serious. Economists Michele Cavallo, Kate Kisselev, Fabrizio Perri, and Nouriel Roubini found a strong correlation between wealth losses on net foreign currency liabilities suffered during the large depreciations seen after an exchange rate crisis, and a measure of the subsequent fall in real output.[14] For example,

Exchange Rate Depreciations and Changes in Wealth The countries shown in the chart experienced crises and large depreciations of between  $50\%$  and  $75\%$  against the U.S. dollar and other major currencies from 1993 to 2003. Because large fractions of their external debt were denominated in foreign currencies, all suffered negative valuation effects causing their external wealth to fall, in some cases (such as Indonesia) quite dramatically.

after 1992 Britain barely suffered any negative wealth effect and, as we noted earlier, did well in its subsequent economic performance: Britain in 1992 sits in the upper left part of this scatterplot (very small wealth loss, no negative impact on GDP). At the other extreme (in the lower right part of this scatterplot), are countries like Argentina and Indonesia, where liability dollarization led to massive wealth losses after the 1997 crisis (large wealth loss, large negative impact on GDP).

Original Sin Such findings have had a powerful influence among international macroeconomists and policymakers in recent years. Previously, external wealth effects were largely ignored and poorly understood. But now, after the adverse consequences of recent large depreciations, macroeconomists recognize that the problem of currency mismatch, driven by liability dollarization, is a key factor in the economic health of many developing countries and should be considered when choosing an exchange rate regime.

Yet these kinds of losses due to currency mismatch are an old problem. In the long history of international investment, one remarkably constant feature has been the inability of most countries—especially poor countries on the periphery of global capital markets—to borrow from abroad in their own currencies. In the late nineteenth century, such countries had to borrow in gold, or in a "hard currency" such as British pounds or U.S. dollars. The same is true today, as is apparent from Table 19-2. In the

Foreign Currency Denominated Debt and the Costs of Crises This chart shows the correlation between a measure of the negative wealth impact of a real depreciation and the real output costs after an exchange rate crisis (a large depreciation). On the horizontal axis, the wealth impact is estimated by multiplying net debt denominated in foreign currency (as a fraction of GDP) by the size of the real depreciation. The negative correlation shows that larger losses on foreign currency debt due to exchange rate changes are associated with larger real output losses.

Economists Barry Eichengreen, Ricardo Hausmann, and Ugo Panizza used the term "original sin" to refer to a country's inability to borrow in its own currency.[15] As the term suggests, an historical perspective reveals that the "sin" is highly persistent and originates deep in a country's historical past. Countries with a weak record of macroeconomic management—often due to institutional or political weakness—have in the past been unable to follow prudent monetary and fiscal policies, so the real value of domestic currency debts was frequently eroded by periods of high inflation. Because creditors were mostly unwilling to hold such debt, domestic currency bond markets did not develop, and creditors would lend only in foreign currency which promised a more stable long-term value.

Still, sinners can find redemption. One view argues that the problem is a global capital market failure: for many small countries, the pool of their domestic currency liabilities may be too small to offer any significant risk diversification benefits to foreign investors. In this case, multinational institutions could step in to create markets for securities in the currencies of small countries, or in baskets of such currencies. Another view argues that as such countries improve their institutional quality, design better policies, secure a low-inflation environment, and

Two Russian bonds: a 100 ruble bond of 1915 and a 1,000 U.S. dollar bond of 1916. Creditors knew the dollar value of the ruble bond could be eroded by ruble depreciation. Only default could erode the value of the dollar bond.

develop a better reputation, they will eventually free themselves from original sin and be able to issue domestic and even external debt in their own currencies. Many observers think this is already happening. Habitual "sinners" such as Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay have recently been able to issue some debt in their own currency. In addition, many emerging countries have been reducing currency mismatch: many governments have been piling up large stocks of foreign currency assets in central bank reserves and sovereign wealth funds and both governments and in some cases the private sectors have been reducing their reliance on foreign currency loans. The recent trends indicate substantial progress in reducing original sin as compared with the 1990s.[16]

Yet any optimism must be tempered with caution. Only time will tell whether countries have really turned the corner and put their "sinful" ways behind them. Progress on domestic-currency borrowing is still very slow in many countries, and this still leaves the problem of currency mismatches in the private sector. While private sector exposure could be insured by the government, that insurance could, in turn, introduce the risk of abuse in the form of moral hazard, the risk that insured entities (here, private borrowers) will engage in excessive risk taking, knowing that they will be bailed out if they incur losses. This moral hazard could then create massive political problems, because it may not be clear who, in a crisis, would receive a public-sector rescue, and who would not. Why can't the private sector simply hedge all its exchange rate risk? This solution would be ideal, but in many emerging markets and developing countries, currency derivative markets are poorly developed, many currencies cannot be hedged at all, and the costs are high.

If developing countries cannot avoid currency mismatches, they must try to cope with them. One way to cope is to reduce or stop external borrowing, but countries are not eager to give up all borrowing in world capital markets. A more feasible alternative is for developing countries to minimize or eliminate valuation effects by limiting the movement of the exchange rate. This is indeed what many countries are doing, and evidence shows that the larger a country's stock of foreign currency liabilities relative to GDP, the more likely that country is to peg its currency to the currency in which the external debt is issued.[17]

The lesson: in countries that cannot borrow in their own currency, floating exchange rates are less useful as a stabilization tool and may be destabilizing. Because this outcome applies particularly to developing countries, they will prefer fixed exchange rates to floating exchange rates, all else equal.

# Summary

We began the chapter by emphasizing the two key factors that influence the choice of fixed versus floating rate regimes: economic integration (market linkages) and economic similarity (symmetry of shocks). But we now see that many other factors can affect the benefits of fixing relative to floating.

A fixed exchange rate may have some additional benefits in some situations. It may be the only transparent and credible way to attain and maintain a nominal anchor, a goal that may be particularly important in emerging markets and developing countries with weak institutions, a lack of central bank independence, strong temptations to use the inflation tax, and poor reputations for monetary stability. A fixed exchange rate may also be the only way to avoid large fluctuations in external wealth, which can be a problem in emerging markets and developing countries with high levels of liability dollarization. These may be powerful additional reasons to fix, and they seem to apply with extra force in developing countries. Therefore, such countries may be less willing to allow their exchange rates to float—a situation that some economists describe as a fear of floating.

To illustrate the influence of additional costs and benefits, consider a Home country thinking of pegging to the U.S. dollar as a base currency (Figure 19-10). A Home country with a fear of floating would perceive additional benefits to a fixed exchange rate, and would be willing to peg its exchange at lower levels of integration and similarity. We would represent this choice as an inward shift of the FIX line from  $FIX_{1}$  to  $FIX_{2}$ . Without fear of floating, based on  $FIX_{1}$ , the Home country would float with symmetry-integration measures given by points 1 and 2, and fix at point 3. But if it had fear of floating, based on  $FIX_{2}$ , it would elect to fix at point 2 because the extra benefits of a fixed rate lower the threshold.

FIGURE 19-10

A Shift in the FIX Line Additional benefits of fixing or higher costs of floating will lower the threshold for choosing a fixed exchange rate. The FIX line moves down. Choosing a fixed rate now makes sense, even at lower levels of symmetry or integration (e.g., at point 2).

# 3 Fixed Exchange Rate Systems

So far, our discussion has considered only the simplest type of fixed exchange rate: a single home country that unilaterally pegs to a foreign base country. In reality there are more complex arrangements, called fixed exchange rate systems, which involve multiple countries. Examples include the global Bretton Woods system, in the 1950s and 1960s, and the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), to which all members have to adhere for at least two years as a precondition to euro entry.

Fixed exchange rate systems like these are based on a reserve currency system in which  $N$  countries  $(1, 2, \dots, N)$  participate. The  $N$ th country, called the center country, provides the reserve currency, which is the base or center currency to which all the other countries peg. In the Bretton Woods system, for example,  $N$  was the U.S. dollar; in the ERM,  $N$  was the German mark until 1999, and is now the euro.

Throughout this chapter, we have assumed that a country pegs unilaterally to a center country, and we know that this leads to a fundamental asymmetry. The center country has monetary policy autonomy and can set its own interest rate  $i^{*}$  as it pleases. The other noncenter country, which is pegging, then has to adjust its own interest rate so that  $i$  equals  $i^{*}$  in order to maintain the peg. The noncenter country loses its ability to conduct stabilization policy, but the center country keeps that power. The asymmetry can be a recipe for political conflict and is known as the Nth currency problem.

Are these problems serious? And can a better arrangement be devised? In this section, we show that cooperative arrangements may be the answer. We study two kinds of cooperation. One form of cooperation is based on mutual agreement and compromise between center and noncenter countries on the setting of interest rates. The other form of cooperation is based on mutual agreements about adjustments to the levels of the fixed exchange rates themselves.

# Cooperative and Noncooperative Adjustments to Interest Rates

Figure 19-11, panel (a), illustrates the possibility of policy conflict between center and noncenter countries. Suppose that Home, which is the noncenter country, experiences an adverse demand shock, but Foreign, the center country, does not. We have studied this case before in the previous chapter: the Home IS curve shifts left and the Home LM curve then must shift up to maintain the peg and ensure that the Home interest rate  $i$  is unchanged and equal to  $i^{*}$ .

We now assume that these shifts have already occurred, and we start the analysis with the Home equilibrium at point 1 (where  $IS_{1}$  and  $LM_{1}$  intersect) in Home's IS-LM diagram in panel (a). Home output is at  $Y_{1}$ , which is lower than Home's desired output  $Y_{0}$ . Foreign is in equilibrium at point  $1'$  (where  $IS_{1}$  and  $LM_{1}$  intersect) in Foreign's IS-LM diagram in panel (b). Because it is the center country, Foreign is assumed to have used stabilization policy and is therefore at its preferred output level  $Y_{0}^{*}$ . The Home interest rate equals the Foreign interest rate,  $i_{1} = i_{1}^{*}$ , because Home is pegged to Foreign; this is the interest rate shown on both vertical axes.

Because this is a unilateral peg, only Foreign, the center country, has monetary policy autonomy and the freedom to set nominal interest rates. Home is in recession (its output  $Y_{1}$  is below its desired output  $Y_{0}$ ), but Foreign has its desired output. If Foreign makes no policy concession to help Home out of its recession, this would be the noncooperative outcome. There would be no burden sharing between the two countries: Home is the only country to suffer.

(a) Home IS-LM Diagram (noncenter)

(b) Foreign IS-LM Diagram (center)

Cooperative and Noncooperative Interest Rate Policies by the Center Country In panel (a), the noncenter home country is initially in equilibrium at point 1 with output at  $Y_{1}$ , which is lower than desired output  $Y_{0}$ . In panel (b), the center foreign country is in equilibrium at its desired output level  $Y_{0}^{*}$  at point  $1'$ . Home and Foreign interest rates are equal,  $i_{1} = i_{1}^{*}$ , and Home is unilaterally pegged to Foreign. Foreign has monetary policy autonomy. If the center country makes no policy concession, this is the noncooperative outcome.

With cooperation, the foreign country can make a policy concession and lower its interest rate and home can do the same and maintain the peg. Lower interest rates in the other country shift each country's IS curve in, but the easing of monetary policy in both countries shifts each country's LM curve down. The net effect is to boost output in both countries. The new equilibria at points 2 and  $2^{\prime}$  lie to the right of points 1 and  $1^{\prime}$ . Under this cooperative outcome, the foreign center country accepts a rise in output away from its desired level, from  $Y_0^*$  to  $Y_2^*$ . Meanwhile, Home output gets closer to its desired level, rising from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ .

Now suppose we shift to a cooperative outcome in which the center country makes a policy concession. How? Suppose Foreign lowers its interest rate from  $i_1^*$  to  $i_2^*$ . Home can now do the same, and indeed must do so to maintain the peg. How do the IS curves shift? A lower Foreign interest rate implies that, all else equal, Home demand is lower, so the Home IS curve shifts in to  $IS_2$ ; similarly, in panel (b), a lower Home interest rate implies that, all else equal, Foreign demand is lower, so the Foreign IS curve shifts in to  $IS_2^*$  in panel (b). However, the easing of monetary policy in both countries means that the LM curves shift down in both countries to  $LM_2$  and  $LM_2^*$ .

What is the net result of all these shifts? To figure out the extent of the shift in the IS curve, we can think back to the Keynesian cross and the elements of demand that underlie points on the IS curve. The peg is being maintained. Because the nominal exchange rate is unchanged, the real exchange rate is unchanged, so neither country sees a shift in its Keynesian cross demand curve due to a change in the trade balance. But both countries do see a rise in the Keynesian cross demand curve, as investment demand rises thanks to lower interest rates. The rise in demand tells us that new equilibrium points 2 and  $2'$  lie to the right of points 1 and  $1'$ : even though the IS curves have shifted in, the downward shifts in the LM curves dominate, and so output in each country will rise in equilibrium.

Compared with the noncooperative equilibrium outcome at points 1 and  $1'$ , Foreign now accepts a rise in output away from its preferred stable level, as output booms from  $Y_0^*$  to  $Y_2^*$ . Meanwhile, Home is still in recession, but the recession is not as deep, and output is at a level  $Y_2$  that is higher than  $Y_1$ . In the noncooperative case, Foreign achieves its ideal output level and Home suffers a deep recession. In the cooperative case, Foreign suffers a slightly higher output level than it would like and Home suffers a slightly lower output level than it would like. The burden of the adverse shock to Home has been shared with Foreign.

Caveats Why would Home and Foreign agree to a cooperative arrangement in the first place? Cooperation might be possible in principle if neither country wants to suffer too much exchange rate volatility against the other—that is, if they are close to wanting to be in a fixed arrangement but neither wants to unilaterally peg to the other. A unilateral peg by either country gives all the benefits of fixing to both countries but imposes a stability cost on the noncenter country alone. If neither country is willing to pay that price, there can be no unilateral peg by either country. They could simply float, but they would then lose the efficiency gains from fixing. But if they can somehow set up a peg with a system of policy cooperation, then they could achieve a lower instability burden than under a unilateral peg and this benefit could tip the scales enough to allow the gains from fixing to materialize for both countries.

Cooperation sounds great on paper. But the historical record casts doubt on the ability of countries to even get as far as announcing cooperation on fixed rates, let alone actually backing that up with true cooperative behavior. Indeed, it is rare to see credible cooperative announcements under floating rates, where much less is at stake. Why?

A major problem is that, at any given time, the shocks that hit a group of economies are typically asymmetric. A country at its ideal output level not suffering a shock may be unwilling to change its monetary policies just to help out a neighbor suffering a shock and keep a peg going. In theory, cooperation rests on the idea that my shock today could be your shock tomorrow, and we can all do better if we even out the burdens with the understanding that they will "average out" in the long run. But policy makers have to be able to make credible long-run commitments to make this work and suffer short-run pain for long-run gain. History shows that these abilities are often sadly lacking: shortsighted political goals commonly win out over longer-term economic considerations.

For example, consider the European ERM, which was effectively a set of unilateral pegs to the German mark, and now to the euro. The ERM was built around the idea of safeguarding gains from trade in Europe by fixing exchange rates, but the designers knew that it had to incorporate some burden-sharing measures to ensure that the burden of absorbing shocks didn't fall on every country but Germany. The measures proved inadequate, however, and in the crisis of 1992 the German Bundesbank ignored pleas from Italy, Britain, and other countries for an easing of German monetary policy as recessions took hold in the bloc of countries pegging to the German mark. When the test of cooperation came along, Germany wanted to stabilize Germany's output, and no one else's. Thus, even in a group of countries as geographically and politically united as the European Union, it was tremendously difficult to make this kind of cooperation work. (This problem was supposed to be alleviated by true monetary union, with the arrival of the euro and the creation of the European Central Bank in 1999, but even there tensions remain.)

Our main conclusion is that, in practice, the center country in a reserve currency system has tremendous autonomy, which it may be unwilling to give up, thus making cooperative outcomes hard to achieve consistently.

# Cooperative and Noncooperative Adjustments to Exchange Rates

We have studied interest rate cooperation. Is there scope for cooperation in other ways? Yes. Countries may decide to adjust the level of the fixed exchange rate. Such an adjustment is (supposedly) a "one-shot" jump or change in the exchange rate at a particular time, which for now we assume to be unanticipated by investors. Apart from that single jump, at all times before and after the change, the exchange rate is left fixed and Home and Foreign interest rates remain equal.

Suppose a country that was previously pegging at a rate  $\overline{E}_1$  announces that it will henceforth peg at a different rate,  $\overline{E}_2 \neq \overline{E}_1$ . By definition, if  $\overline{E}_2 > \overline{E}_1$ , there is a devaluation of the home currency; if  $\overline{E}_2 < \overline{E}_1$ , there is a revaluation of the home currency.

These terms are similar to the terms "depreciation" and "appreciation," which also describe exchange rate changes. Strictly speaking, the terms "devaluation" and "revaluation" should be used only when pegs are being adjusted; "depreciation" and "appreciation" should be used to describe exchange rates that float up or down. Note, however, that these terms are often used loosely and interchangeably.

A framework for understanding peg adjustment is shown in Figure 19-12. We assume now that both Home and Foreign are noncenter countries in a pegged exchange rate system and that each is pegged to a third center currency, say, the U.S. dollar.

(Why this change in the setup compared with the last section? Interest rate adjustment required us to study moves by the center country to help noncenter countries; with exchange rate adjustment, noncenter countries change their exchange rates relative to the center, so in this problem our focus shifts away from the center country.)

We assume that the center (the United States) is a large country with monetary policy autonomy that has set its interest rate at  $i_{\S}$ . Home is pegged to the U.S. dollar at  $\overline{E}_{\text{home}/\S}$  and Foreign is pegged at  $\overline{E}_{\text{foreign}/\S}^{*}$ . In Home's IS-LM diagram in panel (a), equilibrium is initially at point 1 (where  $IS_1$  and  $LM_1$  intersect). Again, because of a prior adverse demand shock, Home output is at  $Y_1$  and is lower than Home's desired output  $Y_0$ . In Foreign's IS-LM diagram in panel (b), equilibrium is at Foreign's desired output level  $Y_0^*$  at point  $1'$  (where  $IS_1^*$  and  $LM_1^*$  intersect). Because Home and Foreign peg to the center currency (here, the U.S. dollar), Home and Foreign interest rates equal the dollar interest rate,  $i_1 = i_1^* = i_{\S}$ .

Now suppose that in a cooperative arrangement, Home devalues against the dollar (and against Foreign) and maintains a peg at a new, higher exchange rate. That is, there is an unanticipated rise in  $\overline{E}_{\mathrm{home}/\mathbb{S}}$ . The Home and Foreign interest rates remain equal to the dollar interest rate,  $i_1 = i_1^* = i_{\mathbb{S}}$ , because both countries still peg. We can think back to the IS-LM model, or back to the Keynesian cross that we used to construct the IS curve, if necessary, to figure out the effect of the change. Because the nominal depreciation by Home is also a real depreciation, Home sees demand increase: the Home IS curve shifts out to  $IS_2$ . Furthermore, the real depreciation for Home is also a real appreciation for Foreign, so Foreign demand decreases: the  $\mathrm{IS}^*$  curve shifts in to  $IS_2^*$ . The outcome is cooperative because the burden of the adverse demand shock is being shared: Home output at  $Y_2$  is lower than the ideal  $Y_0$  but not as low as at  $Y_1$ ; and Foreign has accepted output lower at  $Y_2^*$  than its ideal  $Y_0^*$ .

Why might this kind of cooperation work? Home and Foreign could agree that Home would devalue a little (but not too much) so that both countries would jointly feel the pain. Some other time, when Foreign has a nasty shock, Home would "repay" by feeling some of Foreign's pain.

(b) Foreign IS-LM Diagram (noncenter)

Cooperative and Noncooperative Exchange Rate Adjustments by Noncenter Countries In panel (a), the noncenter home country is initially in equilibrium at point 1 with output at  $Y_{1}$ , which is lower than desired output  $Y_{0}$ . In panel (b), the noncenter foreign country is in equilibrium at its desired output level  $Y_{0}^{*}$  at point  $1'$ . Home and Foreign interest rates are equal to the base (dollar) interest rate and to each other,  $i_{1} = i_{1}^{*} = i_{\S}^{*}$ , and Home and Foreign are unilaterally pegged to the base.

With cooperation, Home devalues slightly against the dollar (and against foreign) and maintains a peg at a higher exchange rate. The Home interest and Foreign interest rates remain the same. But the Home real depreciation causes Home demand to increase: IS shifts out to  $IS_{2}$ . This is also a Foreign real appreciation, so foreign demand decreases:  $\mathsf{IS}^*$  shifts in to  $IS_{2}^{*}$ . Under this cooperative outcome at points 2 and  $2'$ , foreign accepts a fall in output away from its desired level, from  $Y_0^*$  to  $Y_{2}^{*}$ . Meanwhile, Home output gets closer to its desired level, rising from  $Y_{1}$  to  $Y_{2}$ .

With noncooperation, Home devalues more aggressively against the dollar. After a large Home real depreciation, IS shifts out to  $IS_3$  and  $IS^*$  shifts in to  $IS_3^*$ . Under this noncooperative outcome at points 3 and  $3'$ , Home gets its desired output  $Y_0$  by "exporting" the recession to foreign, where output falls all the way to  $Y_3^*$ .

Now suppose we shift to a noncooperative outcome in which Home devalues more aggressively against the dollar. After a large real depreciation by Home, Home demand is greatly boosted, and the Home IS curve shifts out all the way to  $IS_3$ . Home's real depreciation is also a large real appreciation for Foreign, where demand is greatly reduced, so the Foreign  $\mathrm{IS}^*$  curve shifts in all the way to  $IS_3^*$ . The outcome is noncooperative: Home now gets its preferred outcome with output at its ideal level  $Y_0$ ; it achieves this by "exporting" the recession to Foreign, where output falls all the way to  $Y_3^*$ .

There are two qualifications to this analysis. First, we have only considered a situation in which Home wishes to devalue to offset a negative demand shock. But the same logic applies when Home's economy is "overheating" and policy makers fear that output is above the ideal level, perhaps creating a risk of inflationary pressures. In that case, Home may wish to revalue its currency and export the overheating to Foreign.

Second, we have not considered the center country, here the United States. In reality, the center country also suffers some decrease in demand if Home devalues because the center will experience a real appreciation against Home. However, there is less to worry about in this instance: because the United States is the center country, it has policy autonomy, and can always use stabilization policy to boost demand. Thus, there may be a monetary easing in the center country, a secondary effect that we do not consider here.

Caveats We can now see that adjusting the peg is a policy that may be cooperative or noncooperative in nature. If noncooperative, it is usually called a beggar-thy-neighbor policy: Home can improve its position at the expense of Foreign and without Foreign's agreement. When Home is in recession, and its policy makers choose a devaluation and real depreciation, they are engineering a diversion of some of world demand toward Home goods and away from the rest of the world's goods.

This finding brings us to the main drawback of admitting noncooperative adjustments into a fixed exchange rate system. Two can play this game! If Home engages in such a policy, it is possible for Foreign to respond with a devaluation of its own in a tit-for-tat way. If this happens, the pretense of a fixed exchange rate system is over. The countries no longer peg and instead play a new noncooperative game against each other with floating exchange rates.

Cooperation may be most needed to sustain a fixed exchange rate system with adjustable pegs, so as to restrain beggar-thy-neighbor devaluations. But can it work? Consider continental Europe since World War II, under both the Bretton Woods system and the later European systems such as ERM (which predated the euro). A persistent concern of European policy makers in this period was the threat of beggar-thy-neighbor devaluations. For example, the British pound and the Italian lira devalued against the dollar and later the German mark on numerous occasions from the 1960s to the 1990s. Although some of these peg adjustments had the veneer of official multilateral decisions, some (like the 1992 ERM crisis) occurred when cooperation broke down.

# APPLICATION

# The Gold Standard

Our analysis in this section has focused on the problems of policy conflict in a reserve currency system in which there is one center country issuing a currency (e.g., the dollar or euro) to which all other noncenter countries peg. As we know from Figure 19-1, this is an apt description of most fixed exchange rate arrangements at the present time and going back as far as World War II. A key issue in such systems is the asymmetry between the center country, which retains monetary autonomy, and the noncenter countries, which forsake it.

Are there symmetric fixed exchange rate systems, in which there is no center country and the asymmetry created by the  $N$ th currency problem can be avoided? In theory the ERM system worked this way before the advent of the euro in 1999, but, as the 1992 crisis showed, there was, in practice, a marked asymmetry between Germany and the other ERM countries. Historically, the only true symmetric systems have been those in which countries fixed the value of their currency relative to some commodity. The most famous and important of these systems was the gold standard, and this system had no center country because countries did not peg the exchange rate at  $\overline{E}$ , the local currency price of some base currency, but instead they pegged at  $\overline{P_g}$ , the local currency price of gold.

"The best coin that has been struck for two thousand years" declared U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, on the minting of this beautiful and intricate design to improve artistically on what he saw as the "atrocious hideousness" of American coinage. The U.S. gold parity was  \$20.67 per troy ounce from 1834 to 1933, so a\$ 20 gold coin like this 1907 Saint Gaudens Double Eagle contained  $20 / 20.67 = 0.9675$  ounces of gold.

How did this system work? Under the gold standard, gold and money were seamlessly interchangeable, and the combined value of gold and money in the hands of the public was the relevant measure of money supply  $(M)$ . For example, consider two countries, Britain pegging to gold at  $\overline{P}_g$  (pounds per ounce of gold) and France pegging to gold at  $\overline{P}_g^*$  (francs per ounce of gold). Under this system, one pound cost  $1 / \overline{P}_g$  ounces of gold, and each ounce of gold cost  $\overline{P}_g^*$  francs, according to the fixed gold prices set by the central banks in each country. Thus, one pound cost  $E_{\mathrm{par}} = \overline{P}_g^* / \overline{P}_g$  francs, and this ratio defined the par exchange rate implied by the gold prices in each country.

The gold standard rested on the principle of free convertibility. This meant that central banks in both countries stood ready to buy and sell gold in exchange for paper money at these mint prices, and the export and import of gold were unrestricted. This allowed arbitrage forces to stabilize the system. How?

Suppose the market exchange rate in Paris (the price of one pound in francs) was  $E$  francs per pound and deviated from the par level, with  $E < E_{\mathrm{par}}$  francs per pound. This would create an arbitrage opportunity. The franc has appreciated relative to pounds, and arbitrageurs could change 1 ounce of gold into  $\overline{P}_{g}^{*}$  francs at the central bank, and then into  $\overline{P}_{g}^{*} / E$  pounds in the market, which could be shipped to London and converted into  $\overline{P}_{g}^{*} / (E \overline{P}_{g})$  ounces of gold, which could then be brought back to Paris. Because we assumed that  $E < E_{\mathrm{par}}$ ,  $\overline{P}_{g}^{*} / (E \overline{P}_{g}) = E_{\mathrm{par}} / E > 1$ , and the trader ends up with more than an ounce of gold and makes a profit.

As a result of this trade, gold would leave Britain and the British money supply would fall (pounds would be redeemed at the Bank of England by the French traders, who would export the gold back to France). As gold entered France, the French money supply would expand (because the traders could leave it in gold form, or freely change it into franc notes at the Banque de France).

We can note how the result tends to stabilize the foreign exchange market (just as interest arbitrage did in the chapters on exchange rates). Here, the pound was depreciated relative to par and the arbitrage mechanism caused the British money supply to contract and the French money supply to expand. The arbitrage mechanism depended on French investors buying "cheap" pounds. This would bid up the price of pounds in Paris, so  $E$  would rise toward  $E_{\mathrm{par}}$ , stabilizing the exchange rate at its par level.

Four observations are worth noting. First, the process of arbitrage was not really costless, so if the exchange rate deviated only slightly from parity, the profit from arbitrage might be zero or negative (i.e., a loss). Thus, there was a small band around the par rate in which the exchange rate might fluctuate without any arbitrage occurring. However, this band, delineated by limits known as the upper and lower "gold points," was typically small, permitting perhaps at most  $\pm 1\%$  fluctuations in  $E$  on either side of  $E_{\mathrm{par}}$ . The exchange rate was, therefore, very stable. For example, from 1879 to 1914, when Britain and the United States were pegged to gold at a par rate of \$4.86 per pound, the daily dollar-pound market exchange rate in New York was within  $1\%$  of its par value  $99.97\%$  of the time (and within half a percent  $77\%$  of the time).[18]

Second, in our example we examined arbitrage in only one direction, but, naturally, there would have been a similar profitable arbitrage opportunity—subject to transaction costs—in the opposite direction if  $E$  had been above  $E_{\mathrm{par}}$  and the franc had been depreciated relative to parity. (Working out how one makes a profit in that case, and what the net effect would be on each country's money supply, is left as an exercise.)

Third, gold arbitrage would enforce a fixed exchange rate at  $E_{\mathrm{par}}$  (plus or minus small deviations within the gold points), thus setting expected depreciation to zero. Interest arbitrage between the two countries' money markets would equalize the interest rates in each country (subject to risk premiums). So our earlier approach to the study of fixed exchange rates remains valid, including a central principle, the trilemma.

Fourth, and most important, we see the inherent symmetry of the gold standard system when operated according to these principles. Both countries share in the adjustment mechanism, with the money supply contracting in the gold outflow country (here, Britain) and the money supply expanding in the gold inflow country (here, France). In theory, if these principles were adhered to, neither country has the privileged position of being able to not change its monetary policy, in marked contrast to a center country in a reserve currency system. But in reality, the gold standard did not always operate quite so smoothly, as we see in the next section.

# 4 International Monetary Experience

A vast diversity of exchange rate arrangements have been used throughout history. In the chapter that introduced exchange rates, we saw how different countries fix or float at present; at the start of this chapter, we saw how exchange rate arrangements have fluctuated over more than a century. These observations motivated us to study how countries choose to fix or float.

To try to better understand the international monetary experience and how we got to where we are today, we now apply what we have learned in the book so far. In particular, we rely on the trilemma, which tells us that countries cannot simultaneously meet the three policy goals of a fixed exchange rate, capital mobility, and monetary policy autonomy. With the feasible policy choices thus set out, we draw on the ideas of this chapter about the costs and benefits of fixed and floating regimes to try to understand why various countries have made the choices they have at different times.

# The Rise and Fall of the Gold Standard

As we saw in Figure 19-1, the history of international monetary arrangements from 1870 to 1939 was dominated by one story: the rise and fall of the gold standard regime. In 1870 about  $15\%$  of countries were on gold, rising to about  $70\%$  in 1913 and almost  $90\%$  during a brief period of resumption in the 1920s. But by 1939, only about  $25\%$  of the world was pegged to gold. What happened? The analysis in this chapter provides insights into one of the grand narratives of economic history.[20]

The period from 1870 to 1914 was the first era of globalization, with increasingly large flows of trade, capital, and people between countries. Depending on the countries in question, some of these developments were due to technological developments in transport and communications (such as steamships, the telegraph, etc.) and some were a result of policy change (such as tariff reductions). Our model suggests that as the volume of trade and other economic transactions between nations increase, there

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/d98193ab723561ec683d3eef7b4a36a74c9ac5ef9d1ec6504a90553d306a6a40.jpg)

Bryan's "cross of gold."

will be more to gain from adopting a fixed exchange rate (as in Figure 19-4). Thus, as nineteenth-century globalization proceeded, it is likely that more countries crossed the FIX line and met the economic criteria for fixing.

There were also other forces at work encouraging a switch to the gold peg before 1914. The stabilization costs of pegging were either seen as insignificant—because the pace of economic growth was not that unstable—or else politically irrelevant—because the majority of those adversely affected by business cycles and unemployment were from the mostly disenfranchised working classes. With the exception of some emerging markets, price stability was the major goal and the inflation tax was not seen as useful except in emergencies.

As for the question, why peg to gold? (as opposed to silver, or something else), note that once a gold peg became established in a few countries, the benefits of adoption in other countries would increase further. If you are the second country to go on the gold standard, it lowers your trade costs with one other country; if you are the 10th or 20th country to go on, it lowers your trade costs with 10 or 20 other countries; and so on. This can be thought of as a "snowball effect" (or network externality, as economists say), where only one standard can dominate in the end.[21]

This is not to say that all was plain sailing before 1914. Many countries joined gold, only to leave temporarily because of a crisis. Even in countries that stayed on gold, not everyone loved the gold standard. The benefits were often less noticeable than the costs, particularly in times of deflation or in recessions. For example, in the United States, prices and output stagnated in the 1890s. As a result, many people supported leaving the gold standard to escape its monetary restrictions. The tensions reached a head in 1896 at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, when presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan ended his speech saying: "Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world, supported by the commercial interests, the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." (Bryan lost, the pro-gold McKinley became president, the Gold Standard Act of 1900 was passed to bury any doubts, and tensions defused as economic growth and gold discoveries raised output and prices.)

These trends were upset by World War I. Countries participating in the war needed some way to finance their efforts. The inflation tax was heavily used, and this implied exit from the gold standard. In addition, once the war began in Europe (and later drew in the United States), the majority of global trade was affected by it: trade was almost  $100\%$  wiped out between warring nations, and fell by  $50\%$  between participants and neutral countries. This effect persisted long after the war ended, and was made worse by protectionism (higher tariffs and quotas) in the 1920s. By the 1930s, world trade had fallen to close to half of its 1914 level. All of these developments meant less economic integration—which in turn meant that the rationale for fixing based on gains from trade was being weakened.[22]

Then, from 1929 on, the Great Depression undermined the stability argument for pegging to gold. The 1920s and 1930s featured much more violent economic fluctuations than had been seen prior to 1914, raising the costs of pegging. Moreover, politically speaking, these costs could no longer be ignored so easily with the widening of the franchise over time. The rise of labor movements and political parties of the left started to give voice and electoral weight to constituencies that cared much more about the instability costs of a fixed exchange rate.[23]

Other factors also played a role. The Great Depression was accompanied by severe deflation, so to stay on gold might have risked further deflation given the slow growth of gold supplies to which all money supplies were linked. Deflation linked to inadequate gold supplies therefore undermined the usefulness of gold as a nominal anchor.[24] Many countries had followed beggar-thy-neighbor policies in the 1920s, choosing to re-peg their currencies to gold at devalued rates, making further devaluations tempting. Among developing countries, many economies were in recession before 1929 because of poor conditions in commodity markets, so they had another reason to devalue (as some did as early as 1929). The war had also left gold reserves distributed in a highly asymmetric fashion, leaving some countries with few reserves for intervention to support their pegs. As backup, many countries used major currencies as reserves, but the value of these reserves depended on everyone else's commitment to the gold peg, a commitment that was increasingly questionable.

All of these weaknesses undermined the confidence and credibility of the commitment to gold pegs in many countries, making the collapse of the pegs more likely. Currency traders would then speculate against various currencies, raising the risk of a crisis. In the face of such speculation, in 1931 both Germany and Austria imposed capital controls, and Britain floated the pound against gold. The gold standard system then unraveled in a largely uncoordinated, uncooperative, and destructive fashion.

In the language of the trilemma, with its three solutions or "corners," the 1930s saw a movement by policy makers away from the "open capital market/fixed exchange rate" corner, and the other two corners came to dominate. Countries unwilling to close their capital markets by imposing controls opted to abandon the gold peg and moved to the open capital market/floating exchange rate solution, allowing them to regain monetary policy autonomy: Britain and the United States among others made this choice. Countries willing to adopt capital controls but unwilling to suffer the volatility of a floating rate moved to the "closed capital market/fixed exchange rate" solution, allowing them to regain monetary policy autonomy in a different way: Germany and many countries in South America made this choice. Gaining monetary autonomy gave all of these countries the freedom to pursue more expansionary monetary policies to try to revive their economies, and most of them did just that. Finally, a few countries (such as France and Switzerland) remained on the gold standard and did not devalue or impose controls, because they were not forced off gold (they had large reserves) and because they were worried about the inflationary consequences of floating. Countries that stuck with the gold standard paid a heavy price: compared with 1929, countries that floated had  $26\%$  higher output in 1935, and countries that adopted capital controls had  $21\%$  higher output, as compared with the countries that stayed on gold.[25]

Figure 19-13 shows these outcomes. To sum up: although many other factors were important, trade gains and an absence of (or political indifference to) stability costs helped bring the gold standard into being before 1914; reduced trade gains and stability costs that were higher (or more politically relevant) help explain the ultimate demise of the gold standard in the interwar period.

# Bretton Woods to the Present

The international monetary system of the 1930s was chaotic. Near the end of World War II, allied economic policy makers gathered in the United States, at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to try to ensure that the postwar economy fared better. The architects of the postwar order, notably Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, constructed a system that preserved one key tenet of the gold standard

Solutions to the Trilemma Before and After World War I Each corner of the triangle represents a viable policy choice. The labels on the two adjacent edges of the triangle are the goals that can be attained; the label on the opposite edge is the goal that has to be sacrificed. Trade gains and an absence of (or political indifference to) stability costs help explain how the gold standard came into being before 1914 (top corner). Subsequently, reduced trade gains and higher actual (or politically relevant) stability costs help explain the ultimate demise of the gold standard in the 1920s and 1930s. Countries sought new solutions to the trilemma to achieve policy autonomy, either by floating (bottom right corner) or by adopting capital controls (bottom left corner).

regime—by keeping fixed rates—but discarded the other by imposing capital controls. The trilemma was resolved in favor of exchange rate stability to encourage the rebuilding of trade in the postwar period. Countries would peg to the U.S. dollar; this made the U.S. dollar the center currency and the United States the center country. The U.S. dollar was, in turn, pegged to gold at a fixed price, a last vestige of the gold standard.

In Figure 19-14, the postwar period starts with the world firmly in the "closed capital market/fixed exchange rate" corner on the left. At Bretton Woods, the interests of international finance were seemingly dismissed, amid disdain for the speculators who had destabilized the gold standard in the 1920s and 1930s: U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau pronounced that the new institutions would "drive … the usurious money lenders from the temple of international finance." At the time, only the United States allowed full freedom of international capital movement, but this was soon to change.

It was obvious that to have trade one needed to have payments, so some kind of system for credit was needed, at least on a short-term basis. By the late 1950s, after getting by with half measures, many countries in Europe and elsewhere were ready to liberalize financial transactions related to current account transactions to free up the trade and payments system. At the same time, they sought to limit speculative financial transactions that were purely asset trades within the financial account (e.g., interest arbitrage by forex traders).

FIGURE 19-14

Solutions to the Trilemma Since World War II In the 1960s, the Bretton Woods system became unsustainable because capital mobility could not be contained. Thus, countries could no longer have fixed rates and monetary autonomy (bottom left corner). In the advanced countries, the trilemma was resolved by a shift to floating rates, which preserved autonomy and allowed for the present era of capital mobility (bottom right corner). The main exception was the currency union of the Eurozone. In developing countries and emerging markets, the "fear of floating" was stronger; when capital markets were opened, monetary policy autonomy was more often sacrificed and fixed exchange rates were maintained (top corner).

Unfortunately, in practice it proved difficult then (and has proved so ever since) to put watertight controls on financial transactions. Controls in the 1960s were very leaky and investors found ways to circumvent them and move money offshore from local currency deposits into foreign currency deposits. Some used accounting tricks such as overor underinvoicing trade transactions to move money from one currency to another. Others took advantage of the largely unregulated offshore currency markets that had emerged in London and elsewhere in the late 1950s.

As capital mobility grew and controls failed to hold, the trilemma tells us that countries pegged to the dollar stood to lose their monetary policy autonomy. This was already a reason for them to think about exiting the dollar peg. With autonomy evaporating, the devaluation option came to be seen as the most important way of achieving policy compromise in a "fixed but adjustable" system. But increasingly frequent devaluations (and some revaluations) undermined the notion of a truly fixed rate system, made it more unstable, generated beggar-thy-neighbor policies, and—if anticipated—encouraged speculators.

The downsides became more and more apparent as the 1960s went on. Other factors included a growing unwillingness in many countries to peg to the U.S. dollar, after inflation in the Vietnam War era undermined the dollar's previously strong claim to be the best nominal anchor currency. It was also believed that this inflation would eventually conflict with the goal of fixing the dollar price of gold and that the United States would eventually abandon its commitment to convert dollars into gold, which happened in August 1971. By then it had become clear that U.S. policy was geared to U.S. interests, and if the rest of the world needed a reminder about asymmetry, they got it from U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally, who in 1971 uttered the memorable words, "The dollar is our currency, but it's your problem."

Figure 19-14 tells us what must happen in an international monetary system once capital mobility reasserts itself, as happened to the Bretton Woods system in the 1960s. The "closed capital market/fixed exchange rate" corner on the left is no longer an option. Countries must make a choice: they can stay fixed and have no monetary autonomy (move to the top corner), or they can float and recover monetary autonomy (move to the right corner).

These choices came to the fore after the Bretton Woods system collapsed between 1971 and 1973. How did the world react? There have been a variety of outcomes, and the tools developed in this chapter help us to understand them:

- Most advanced countries have opted to float and preserve monetary policy autonomy. This group includes the United States, Japan, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. They account for the growing share of floating regimes in Figure 19-1. For these countries, stability costs outweigh integration benefits. They are at the bottom right corner of the trilemma diagram.
A group of European countries instead decided to try to preserve a fixed exchange rate system among themselves, first via the ERM and now "irrevocably" through the adoption of a common currency, the euro. Integration gains in the closely integrated European market might, in part, explain this choice. This group of countries is at the top corner of the trilemma diagram.
Some developing countries have maintained capital controls, but many of them (especially the emerging markets) have opened their capital markets. Given the "fear of floating" phenomenon, their desire to choose fixed rates (and sacrifice monetary autonomy) is much stronger than in the advanced countries, all else equal. These countries are also at the top corner of the trilemma diagram.

Some countries, both developed and developing, have camped in the middle ground: they have attempted to maintain intermediate regimes, such as "dirty floats" or pegs with "limited flexibility." India is often considered to be a case of an intermediate regime somewhere between floating or fixed. Such countries are somewhere in the middle on the right side of the trilemma diagram.

Finally, some countries still impose some capital controls rather than embrace globalization. China has been in this position, although things are gradually starting to change and the authorities have suggested further moves toward financial liberalization in the future. These countries, mostly developing countries, are clinging to the bottom left corner of the trilemma diagram.

# 5 Conclusions

Exchange rate regimes have varied greatly across countries and across time and continue to do so. Explaining why this is the case and figuring out the optimal choice of exchange rate regime are major tasks in international macroeconomics.

We began this chapter by studying the main costs and benefits of fixed versus floating regimes. Fixing enhances the economic efficiency of international transactions. Floating allows authorities to stabilize an economy with monetary policy. The clash between these two goals creates a trade-off. Only with enough economic integration (more gains on transactions) and sufficiently symmetric shocks (less need for policy autonomy) do fixed exchange rates make sense, as shown in the symmetry-integration diagram.

However, other factors affect the trade-off, especially in emerging markets and developing countries: fixed exchange rates may provide the only credible nominal anchor after a high inflation, and they insulate countries with net foreign currency debt from the adverse wealth effects of depreciations.

Finally, we examined exchange rate systems in theory and in practice. Over the years, fixed rate systems such as the gold standard and the Bretton Woods system have come and gone, with collapses driven, at least in part, by failures of cooperation. That leaves us today with no real international monetary "system" at all, but rather many countries, and occasionally groups of countries, pursuing their own interests and trying to make the best choice of regime given their particular circumstances. As this chapter has shown, there may be good reasons why "one size fits all" will never apply to exchange rate regimes.

# KEY POINTS

1. A wide variety of exchange rate regimes have been in operation throughout history to the present.
2. The benefits for the home country from a fixed exchange rate include lower transaction costs and increased trade, investment, and migration with the base or center country.
3. The costs to the home country from a fixed exchange rate arise primarily when the home and center countries experience different eco nomic shocks and Home would want to pursue monetary policies different from those of the base or center country.
4. The costs and benefits of fixing can be summed up on a symmetry-integration diagram. At high levels of symmetry and/or integration, above the FIX line, it makes sense to fix. At low levels of symmetry and/or integration, below the FIX line, it makes sense to float.
5. A fixed rate may confer extra benefits if it is the only viable nominal anchor in a high-inflation country and if it prevents adverse wealth shocks caused by depreciation in countries suffering from a currency mismatch.
6. Using these tools and the trilemma, we can better understand exchange rate regime choices in the past and in the present. Before 1914 it appears the gold standard did promote integration, and political concern for the loss of stabilization policies was limited. In the 1920s and

1930s, increased isolationism, economic instability, and political realignments undermined the gold standard. After 1945 and up to the late 1960s, the Bretton Woods system of fixed dollar exchange rates was feasible, with strict controls on capital mobility, and was attractive as long as U.S. policies were not at odds with the rest of the world. Since 1973 different countries and groups of countries have gone their own way, and exchange rate regimes reflect the sovereign choice of each country.

# PROBLEMS

1. Using the IS-LM-FX model, illustrate how each of the following scenarios affects the home country. Compare the outcomes when the home country has a fixed exchange rate with the outcomes when the home currency floats.

a. The foreign country increases the money supply.

b. The home country cuts taxes.

c. Investors expect a future appreciation in the home currency.

2. The Lithuanian lita is currently pegged to the euro. Using the IS-LM-FX model for Home (Lithuania) and Foreign (Eurozone), illustrate how each of the following scenarios affect Lithuania: a. The Eurozone reduces its money supply.

b. Lithuania cuts government spending to reduce its budget deficit.

c. The Eurozone countries increase their taxes.

3. Consider two countries that are currently pegged to the euro: Lithuania and Comoros. Lithuania is a member of the European Union, allowing it to trade freely with other European

Union countries. Exports to the Eurozone account for the majority of Lithuania's outbound trade, which mainly consists of manufacturing goods, services, and wood. In contrast, Comoros is an archipelago of islands off the eastern coast of southern Africa that exports food commodities primarily to the United States and France. Comoros historically maintained a peg with the French franc, switching to the euro when France joined the Eurozone. Compare and contrast Lithuania and Comoros in terms of their likely degree of integration symmetry with the Eurozone. Plot Comoros and Lithuania on a symmetry-integration diagram as in Figure 19-4.

4. Use the symmetry-integration diagram as in Figure 19-4 to explore the evolution of international monetary regimes from 1870 to 1939—that is, during the rise and fall of the gold standard.

a. From 1870 to 1913, world trade flows doubled in size relative to GDP, from about  $10\%$  to  $20\%$ . Many economic historians believe this was driven by exogenous declines in transaction costs, some of which were caused by changes in transport technology. How would you depict this shift for a pair of countries in the symmetry-integration diagram that started off just below the FIX line in 1870? Use the letter A to label your starting point in 1870 and use B to label the end point in 1913.

b. From 1913 to 1939, world trade flows collapsed, falling in half relative to GDP, from about  $20\%$  back to  $10\%$ . Many economic historians think this was driven by exogenous increases in transaction costs from rising transport costs and increases in tariffs and quotas. How would you depict this shift for a pair of countries in the symmetry-integration diagram that started off just above the FIX line in 1913? Use the letter B to label your starting point in 1913 and use C to label the end point in 1939.

c. Other economic historians contend that these changes in transaction costs arose endogenously. When countries went on the gold standard, they lowered their transaction costs and boosted trade. When they left gold, costs increased. If this is true, then do points A, B, and C represent unique solutions to the problem of choosing an exchange rate regime?

d. Changes in other factors in the 1920s and 1930s had an impact on the sustainability of the gold standard. These included the following: i. An increase in country-specific shocks

ii. An increase in democracy iii. Growth of world output relative to the supply of gold

In each case, explain why these changes might have undermined commitment to the gold standard.

5. Many countries experiencing high and rising inflation, or even hyperinflation, will adopt a fixed exchange rate regime. Discuss the potential costs and benefits of a fixed exchange rate regime in this case. Comment on fiscal discipline, seigniorage, and expected future inflation.
6. In the late 1970s, several countries in Latin America, notably Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, had accumulated large external debt burdens. A significant share of this debt was denominated in U.S. dollars. The United States pursued contractionary monetary policy from 1979 to 1982, raising dollar interest rates. How would this affect the value of the Latin American currencies relative to the U.S. dollar? How would this affect their external debt in local currency terms? If these countries had wanted to prevent a change in their external debt, what would have been the appropriate policy response, and what would be the drawbacks?
7. Home's currency is the peso and trades at 1 peso per dollar. Home has external assets of \$200 billion, all of which are denominated in dollars. It has external liabilities of \$400 billion, 75\% of which are denominated in dollars.

a. Is Home a net creditor or debtor? What is Home's external wealth?

b. What is Home's net position in dollar-denominated assets?

c. If the peso depreciates to 1.2 pesos per dollar, what is the change in Home's external wealth in pesos?

8. Evaluate the empirical evidence on how currency depreciation affects wealth and output across countries. How does the decision of maintaining a fixed versus floating exchange rate regime depend on a country's external wealth position?
9. Home signs a free-trade agreement with Foreign, which lowers tariffs and other barriers to trade. Both countries are very similar in terms of economic shocks, as they each produce very similar goods. Use a symmetry-integration diagram as in Figure 19-4 as part of your answer to the following questions: a. Initially, trade rises. Does the rise in trade make Home more or less likely to peg its currency to the Foreign currency? Why?

b. In the longer run, freer trade causes the countries to follow their comparative advantage and specialize in producing very different types of goods. Does the rise in specialization make Home more or less likely to peg its currency to the Foreign currency? Why?
