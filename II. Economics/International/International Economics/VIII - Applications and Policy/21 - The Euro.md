# Topics in International Macroeconomics

Economics is a science of thinking in terms of models joined to the art of choosing models which are relevant to the contemporary world.

John Maynard Keynes, 1938 ike other fields of economics, international macroeconomics is evolving continually. New empirical analyses are constantly appearing, deepening our understanding, and bringing attention to new phenomena. New theoretical models are always being developed, to better explain long-standing puzzles or to confront new ones. The fast-changing global economic environment of recent years has pushed forward research faster than ever.

In the four stand-alone sections of this final chapter, we examine several important topics that have occupied researchers for many years and that remain at the cutting edge. In these "mini-chapters" we explore new issues as well as important extensions to the core models presented earlier in the book:

- We ask whether purchasing power parity really works as a long-run theory of exchange rates. Evidence shows that a better theory has to explain why price levels are higher in richer countries. We develop such a theory and show how it can be applied to improve exchange rate forecasts.
- We ask whether uncovered interest parity really works as a short-run theory of exchange rates. We show that forex traders often make massive profits (and also losses) and that such profits may be somewhat predictable. If arbitrage operates to support uncovered interest parity in an efficient market, such profits ought to be eliminated. One explanation might be that there are limits to arbitrage, such as an aversion to the extreme riskiness of profits in the forex market.

1 Exchange Rates in the Long Run: Deviations from Purchasing Power Parity

2 Exchange Rates in the Short Run: Deviations from Uncovered Interest Parity

3 Debt and Default

4 The Global Macroeconomy and the 2007-2013 Crisis

We study the problem of defaults by governments on their debt. Some of the facts to be explained are why any lenders lend given the risk of default, why borrowers choose to default when they do, and what price they pay for defaulting. We develop a model in which adverse economic shocks (low output) make countries more likely to default. The bigger such shocks are, the more the countries default, and the less willing lenders are to lend, unless they receive a higher interest rate. The model fits various facts: poorer countries have more volatile output, are charged higher interest rates, default more often even at lower levels of debt, and lenders don't make much profit.

We look at the performance of the global macroeconomy before, during, and after the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis and subsequent Great Recession. We look to understand some of the causes and consequences of this event using the tools we have developed throughout the book, even as the repercussions of this event continue to unfold.

# 1 Exchange Rates in the Long Run: Deviations from Purchasing Power Parity

According to the most recent data from the World Bank, in 2012 gross national income per capita in the United States was  \$50,120, but by converting incomes using the exchange rate, it was found that gross national income per capita in China was only\$ 5,740, about 11.5\% of the U.S. level. Were the Chinese really that poor in terms of material living standards? No.

When the calculations were repeated by comparing dollar incomes with the dollar prices of baskets of consumer goods, Chinese gross national income per capita was found to be about 9,210 in terms of U.S. consumer goods, so that nation's living standards were now seen to be almost twice as high, at 18.4\% of the U.S. level. The reason: in dollar terms, most goods cost a lot less in China than in the United States. The dollar price level in China was lower than in the United States. The implication: purchasing power parity (PPP) does not hold, and the real exchange rate is a long way from 1.

These adjustments have many implications: for example, they affect calculations of living standards, poverty, allocations of aid, and projections of growth, consumption, demographics, pollution, and so on. So we need to understand these deviations from PPP for many reasons, including the need to refine our theory of exchange rates. When we learned about long-run exchange rates, we showed that we could predict the expected future exchange rate using the monetary approach to exchange rates, if purchasing power parity holds, that is, if baskets of goods sell for the same price in all locations. This theory provided a workable model of real exchange rates, but it was far from perfect. In this section, we address a major deficiency in PPP theory: its assumption that all goods are costlessly tradable.

# Limits to Arbitrage

One way to set up a more realistic economic model would be to introduce costs of trading, which is now an important area of research in international economics.

To gain familiarity with trade costs and to see how they matter, let's assume that the cost of trading the good equals some fraction  $c$  of the unit cost of the good at its

source. For example, suppose there is one good, and it sells for P = \$100 in Home. It costs \$10 to ship the good from Home to another country, Foreign. The trade cost is c = 0.1 = 10\%. The cost of the good on arrival in Foreign, including the trade cost, would be P × (1 + c) = 110.

How do trade costs affect arbitrage? If you were considering trying to make an arbitrage profit by shipping a \$100 widget from Home to Foreign, then you wouldn't even think of doing it unless the Foreign price converted into dollars EP* was at least \$110 (where E is Home's exchange rate, and P* is the Foreign price in Foreign currency). Otherwise, you make a loss once the trading costs are taken into account. Similarly, going from Foreign to Home, you wouldn't ship goods unless the Home price P was at least 10\% above the foreign price EP*.

Formally, the ratio of the prices in the two locations can be written in proportional terms as  $q = EP^{*} / P$ . As we learned in our study of long-run exchange rates, for any basket of goods,  $q$  is also known as the real exchange rate of the home country. Thus, if  $P = \100$  and  $EP^{*} = \$ 110 , then this relative price ratio would be  $(110 / 100) = 1.1$ .

As we have just seen, arbitrage from Home to Foreign is profitable only if the Foreign price is higher than the Home price adjusted for the trade cost, which requires  $q = EP^{*} / P > 1 + c$ . Conversely, arbitrage the other way is profitable only if the Home price is sufficiently higher than the Foreign price, with  $1 / q = P / (EP^{*}) > 1 + c$ .

Thus, if  $q$  is below  $1 + c$ , there will be no arbitrage from Home to Foreign. And if  $q$  is above  $1 / (1 + c)$ , there will be no arbitrage from Foreign to Home. So we have shown that, taking trade costs into account, the no arbitrage condition for market equilibrium is

$$
\frac {1}{1 + c} \leq \underbrace {\frac {E P ^ {*}}{P}} _ {\leq 1 + c}
$$

Real exchange rate  $q$

Let's look at what this condition implies for various levels of trading costs.

Zero costs. With  $c = 0$ , the no arbitrage equilibrium condition reduces to an equality because both leftand right-hand sides equal 1, implying that  $q = 1$ . This equality is the condition for the law of one price (LOOP), which we expect to hold when arbitrage is costless. An illustration is shown in Figure 22-1, panel (a), which plots the hypothetical relative price  $q$  over time for Home and Foreign.

Low costs. Suppose  $c$  is low, say,  $10\%$ , as in our example. If the price difference between source and destination is less than  $10\%$ , then there is no arbitrage. Hence,  $q$  is free to wander in what is called a no-arbitrage band between  $1 / (1 + c) = (100 / 110)$  and  $1 + c = (110 / 100)$ . For values of  $q$  between 0.91 and 1.1, then, the market is considered to be in equilibrium. This is shown in Figure 22-1, panel (b). Small deviations from LOOP are possible, but LOOP is still approximately true.

- High costs. Suppose  $c$  is high, say,  $50\%$ . If the price difference is less than  $50\%$ , there will be no arbitrage. There is a wider no-arbitrage band between  $1 / (1 + c) = (100 / 150)$  and  $1 + c = (150 / 100)$  in which the market is in equilibrium and no arbitrage is possible. This is shown in Figure 22-1, panel (c). Deviations from LOOP are possible in the range 0.67 to 1.5, and LOOP no longer applies.

This analysis shows that when trade costs or costs of arbitrage are higher, arbitrage will not happen for small price deviations, and the possible deviations from LOOP

No Arbitrage Bands The hypothetical relative price ratio  $q$  is shown in three cases. In panel (a), trade costs are zero, so the law of one price (LOOP) holds and  $q$  has to equal 1. In panel (b), trade costs are small, say,  $10\%$ , so the prices in the two locations can differ. The high price can exceed the low price by up to  $10\%$ , so  $q$  can range between 100/110 (0.91) and 110/100 (1.1). In panel (c), trade costs are high, say,  $50\%$ , so the high price may exceed the low price by up to  $50\%$ , so  $q$  can range between 150/100 and 100/150. Thus, as costs of arbitrage increase, deviations from simple LOOP and PPP become larger, and these "laws" become less useful.

(b) Low Costs of Arbitrage

(c) High Costs of Arbitrage become greater. If the prices of many goods deviated from LOOP, this would imply deviations from PPP. If costs are huge, then arbitrage is practically impossible and the prices of the same good in two locations need not bear any relation to one another and can be very far apart. Under such conditions, goods are almost always nontraded, and LOOP and PPP will not apply.

Trade Costs in Practice These results show that when evaluating LOOP for one good or PPP for a basket of goods, we must take into account trade costs and consider how they affect deviations from price equality. Empirical research suggests that trade costs are affected by economic policies, as well as by characteristics of goods and their markets.

An important part of trade costs is costs of transportation. For U.S. imports, for example, estimated freight rates vary from  $1\%$  of the good's price (for transport equipment) to  $27\%$  (for fertilizer). In many countries with worse transport infrastructure, these costs can be much higher: one estimate suggests that the average landlocked country has transport costs  $55\%$  higher than the average coastal country.

Another major factor that influences trade costs is a country's trade policy. Average tariffs of  $5\%$  (rich countries) or more than  $10\%$  (developing countries) constitute an additional cost, and such tariffs vary widely by type of good. Quotas (limits to import quantities) and regulatory barriers (such as health and environmental regulations) also add to trade costs, but the costs they add are difficult to compute. In addition to transport and policy costs, economists have found statistical evidence of other causes of price gaps between markets, including distance between markets, crossing international borders, having different currencies, having floating exchange rates, and so on.

The illustration that follows shows the magnitudes of international trade costs for advanced countries. Like the variable  $c$  above, these costs are expressed as a percentage markup over the pre-shipment price of the goods. The data are averaged over all types of goods and based on direct measurements and econometric estimates:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/50470d25976e5d07fb31a4083585f225027448152dab33bf46e2c6b21e12b586.jpg)

(Note that the subcosts are aggregated by compounding: e.g., a  $21\%$  markup on top of a  $44\%$  markup on a \$1 good in the middle column results in a 74\%$  markup in the left column, because  \$1.21 \times 1.44 \times \$ 1 = \$1.74.)

These data show that trade costs are large—and typically, they are even larger outside the advanced countries and create a very wide no-arbitrage band. This observation has led economists to incorporate trade costs into our economic models, so we can develop a more realistic theory of what goes on in the real world.

# APPLICATION

# It's Not Just the Burgers That Are Cheap

If real exchange rates can deviate from the PPP-implied value of 1, the next question to ask is, how do they vary, and why? One place to find a clue is in the pattern of deviations from PPP. For example, look at the Economist newspaper's Big Mac index by searching the Internet for "economist big mac index." If deviations from PPP were random, they might easily be dismissed as an approximation error. However, deviations from PPP in the Big Mac index are not entirely random: burgers tend to be cheaper in poorer countries. In July 2012, for example, the Economist found that, expressed in U.S. dollars, a Big Mac cost  $38\%$  less in Mexico and  $46\%$  less in Malaysia than it did in the United States.

(b) GDP per Person and Price Levels

Big Mac Price Levels in Rich and Poor Countries Panel (a) shows that richer countries (measured by higher wages) tend to have higher Big Mac prices (measured in a common currency). Panel (b) shows that richer countries (measured by higher GDP per person) tend to have higher overall price levels (measured in a common currency).

It isn't too difficult to think of a reason for this finding—the presence of nontraded goods. A Big Mac is a combination of some traded goods (such as flour, beef, and special sauce) and some nontraded goods (such as cooks and cleaners). Local labor wages are a large percentage of the costs of nontraded goods, so such goods tend to cost less in a poor country where wages are lower. The evidence in Figure 22-2, panel (a), supports this logic. This scatterplot shows that the dollar price of the Big Mac is strongly correlated with the local hourly wage in dollars.

Why stop here? The argument shouldn't apply only to burgers, and indeed in 2004 the Economist did a parallel experiment and compared the prices of another globally uniform and omnipresent consumer product: the Starbucks tall latte. Similar patterns

emerged: in dollar terms (adjusting for international variations in the size of the cups) the latte cost  $15\%$  less in Mexico and  $25\%$  less in Malaysia than it did in the United States.

The argument applies to most goods that are included in calculations of national price levels. Almost all goods have some local, nontraded component—some local value added or some local retail and distribution costs. Thus, the general price level should vary systematically in the same way, and it does. Figure 22-2, panel (b), shows that a country's price level is strongly correlated with the level of GDP per person. Rich countries have higher price levels; their baskets cost more. In other words, the real exchange rate  $q = EP^{*} / P$  does not equal 1 for all countries, and PPP does not hold, even in the long run. The remainder of this section explores this pattern using economic theory and considers what effect the lack of PPP has on the exchange rate models and predictions we developed earlier in the book.

# Nontraded Goods and the Balassa-Samuelson Model

Trade costs have major implications for international macroeconomics. In fact, by expanding our analysis from one good that is traded to two goods—one traded and one not traded—we can explain price level differences and deviations from PPP.

We assume there are two countries: Home and Foreign (values for Foreign are denoted by an asterisk). Thus,  $w$  denotes the Home wage and  $w^{*}$  denotes the Foreign wage, each measured in the respective currencies. The Home exchange rate is  $E$  (units of Home currency per unit of Foreign currency). There are two goods. Each good is produced competitively and labor is the only input needed. One is a nontraded, service good (say, a haircut), denoted  $N$ , and its trade costs are effectively infinite. The other is a costlessly tradable good (say, a DVD player), denoted  $T$ , that has no trade costs at all. Prices of goods will be denoted  $p$  and  $p^{*}$ , each measured in the respective currencies, with subscripts  $T$  and  $N$  to denote traded and nontraded goods.

A Simple Model The model can be solved in three steps, with assumptions as follows:

1. The traded good has the same price in both countries. This is true because trade costs are zero. For simplicity, we assume that the traded good has a price of 1 when measured in Home currency (say, dollars). This is its price in Home and Foreign, so

$$ p _ {T} = 1 \quad E p _ {T} ^ {*} = 1
$$

In our example, the DVD player sells for 1 everywhere.

2. Productivity in traded goods determines wages. Suppose that one Home worker can make A units of the traded good (the DVD player) per hour. Then the worker's hourly wage w will be equal to $A because each unit of the good sells for \$1 and competition means that the wage will equal the value of the output produced by each hour of labor input. Similarly, if Foreign workers can make A* units of the traded good per hour, their dollar wage Ew* will be equal to $A*. Thus, wage levels in each country are equal to productivity levels:

$$ w = A \quad E w ^ {*} = A ^ {*}
$$

In our example, if Home workers make ten \$1 DVD players per hour, their hourly wage is \$10 per hour. If Foreign workers make only five per hour, their hourly wage is 5.

3. Wages determine the prices of nontraded goods. Crucially, we assume that the level of productivity in nontraded goods is a fixed constant, the same everywhere, equal to 1. In our example, it always takes one hour to get a haircut in Home and Foreign, but with the wages given previously, this means the cost of a haircut will equal exactly one hour of labor. In general, the dollar price of the nontraded good in each country equals the wage, so  $p_N = w$  and  $E p_N^* = E w^*$ . Because these wages are given by productivity (as we saw in the second step),

$$ p _ {N} = A \quad E p _ {N} ^ {*} = A ^ {*}
$$

To continue our example, if the productivities are 10 and 5 in Home and Foreign, the hourly wages must be  \$10 and\$ 5, respectively, and Home haircuts will cost \$10 and Foreign haircuts \$5.

The conclusion from these three assumptions? Countries with higher traded goods productivity will have relatively high wages and hence relatively high prices of nontraded goods. This means they will also have relatively higher overall price levels, depending on how large the share of nontraded goods in the consumption basket is. To see this, suppose the nontraded goods share of consumption is  $n$  (so the traded share is  $1 - n$ ).

Changes in Productivity Now suppose Home productivity  $A$  increases, with the proportional change given by  $\Delta A / A$ . What happens to the Home price level? The price of traded goods is unchanged and stays at 1, but the price of nontraded goods is equal to  $A$  and it rises. Taking the weighted average, we can compute the (percentage) change in the Home price level as

$$
\underbrace {\frac {\Delta P}{P}} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n} \quad \text {H o m e p r i c e l e v e l}} = \underbrace {(1 - n)} _ {\text {S h a r e o f}} \times \underbrace {\left(\frac {\Delta p _ {T}}{p _ {T}}\right)} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n} \quad \text {H o m e t r a d e d g o o d s p r i c e}} + \underbrace {n} _ {\text {S h a r e o f}} \times \underbrace {\left(\frac {\Delta p _ {N}}{p _ {N}}\right)} _ {\text {N o n t r a d e d g o o d s}} = n \frac {\Delta A}{A}
$$

By the same logic, the same is true for Foreign: a change in its dollar price level will result from a change in foreign productivity:

$$
\underbrace {\frac {\Delta (E P ^ {*})}{(E P ^ {*})}} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n}} = \underbrace {(1 - n)} _ {\text {T r a d e d g o o s}} \times \underbrace {\left(\frac {\Delta (E p _ {T} ^ {*})}{(E p _ {T} ^ {*})}\right)} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n}} + \underbrace {n} _ {\text {S h a r e o f}} \times \underbrace {\frac {\Delta (E p _ {N} ^ {*})}{(E p _ {N} ^ {*})}} _ {\text {N o n t r a d e d g o o s}} = n \frac {\Delta A ^ {*}}{A ^ {*}}
$$

The last two equations are intuitive. For our example, a  $1\%$  rise in Home DVD player productivity  $A$  will raise Home wages  $w$  by  $1\%$ ; therefore, Home haircut prices rise  $1\%$  and, because these haircuts have a weight  $n < 1$  in the overall basket, the overall price index rises by  $n\%$ .

By putting together these last two results, we can solve for the change in the real exchange rate  $q$ . Recall that  $q$  is equal to  $EP^{*} / P$ , so the percentage change in  $q$  is given by the percentage change in the numerator  $EP^{*}$  minus the percentage change in the denominator  $P$ . But we have just computed those changes in the last two equations. Hence, subtracting the first equation above from the second, the change in the real exchange rate is given by

$$
\underbrace {\frac {\Delta q}{q}} _ {\substack {\text {Change in} \\ \text {real exchange rate} \\ (\text {Foreign price level} E P ^ {*} \\ \text {relative to Home} P)}} = \underbrace {n} _ {\substack {\text {Share of} \\ \text {nontraded goods}}} \times \underbrace {\left(\frac {\Delta A ^ {*}}{A ^ {*}} - \frac {\Delta A}{A}\right)} _ {\substack {\text {Change in} \\ \text {Foreign traded} \\ \text {productivity level} \\ \text {relative to Home}}} \tag{22 - 1}
$$

Thus, relative productivities in the traded goods sector drive relative prices, through their effects on wages and prices in the nontraded sector.

Generalizing In this example, we examined the effects of productivity and wages on the prices of DVD players and haircuts. The analysis applies to all goods, however, and it can explain the cheap Big Mac story told earlier. A country has relatively low wages because it has relatively low labor productivity in traded goods. Low productivity and wages hold down the prices of nontraded goods and the nontraded part of the overall price level.

This equation describes a relationship between productivity and the real exchange rate known as the Balassa-Samuelson effect, named for the economists Bela Balassa and Paul Samuelson:

When compared with other countries, a country experiencing an increase in productivity will see wages and incomes rise and will see its real exchange rate appreciate, meaning that its price level will rise.

# Overvaluations, Undervaluations, and Productivity Growth: Forecasting Implications for Real and Nominal Exchange Rates

The Balassa-Samuelson model makes a firm prediction that is supported strongly by evidence: price levels are higher in rich countries. The scatterplot in Figure 22-2, panel (b), showed this fact, and we zoom in to examine a part of it in Figure 22-3.

In such a figure, a point on the line of best fit is the predicted equilibrium real exchange rate  $\tilde{q}$  of the Balassa-Samuelson model. Figure 22-3 plots the U.S. real exchange rate against each foreign country—it shows foreign dollar prices  $EP^{*}$  relative to U.S. prices  $P$ . So an increase on the vertical axis is a rise in the relative price of foreign goods: it is a U.S. real depreciation, or a foreign real appreciation. The actual data do not sit precisely on the line of best fit. That is, the observed real exchange rate  $q$  may differ from its equilibrium value  $\tilde{q}$ .

FIGURE 22-3

Predicted Real Exchange Rate Adjustments in Emerging Markets The scatterplot shows national price levels and GDP per person relative to the United States for the year 2000, as in Figure 22-2(b). The Balassa-Samuelson model would predict convergence to equilibrium in all cases (arrows 1, 3, 4). In relatively fast-growing countries, this would be augmented by trend real appreciation (arrows 2 and 5). Thus, real appreciations were expected for the Chinese yuan and the Slovak koruna, and a real depreciation for the Argentine peso.

As we saw in the long-run exchange rates chapter, the typical real exchange rate  $q$  can from time to time experience an overvaluation or undervaluation relative to its equilibrium value  $\tilde{q}$ . But there we assumed that the equilibrium value was 1, as predicted by PPP theory. Here, the equilibrium  $\tilde{q}$  isn't necessarily 1, and is given the Balassa-Samuelson theory.

Here, we judge deviations from equilibrium by looking at the distance from the equilibrium, that is, from the line of best fit. For example, if actual  $q$  is  $10\%$  above predicted  $\tilde{q}$ , then foreign prices are "too high": we would say that the U.S. real exchange rate is undervalued and the foreign real exchange rate overvalued relative to the equilibrium level  $\tilde{q}$ .

We can now begin to see how the Balassa-Samuelson theory can improve our theory of exchange rates in the long run and the forecasts that depend on such a theory.

Forecasting the Real Exchange Rate By comparing actual exchange rates with their predicted equilibrium values, forecasting the real exchange rate can be broken down into two problems: (1) how quickly  $q$  will return toward its equilibrium value  $\tilde{q}$  and (2) how quickly the equilibrium value  $\tilde{q}$  will change over time as a result of productivity changes. In other words,  $q$  may be heading toward a target level  $\tilde{q}$ , but our model tells us that it might be a moving target that is moving along a trend. This means that real exchange rate prediction must be broken down into two parts.

For example, suppose  $q$  is currently 0.5 but the Balassa-Samuelson model says the equilibrium value of  $\tilde{q}$  is 0.6. Clearly,  $q$  is predicted to rise by 0.1, or by  $20\%$ , to return to equilibrium  $(0.1 / 0.5 = 20\%)$ . How long will this take?

Convergence The first step is to figure out the speed of convergence to equilibrium. Empirical estimates indicate that real exchange rate deviations from equilibrium might decay slowly: the consensus "half life" of deviations from PPP has been reported to be five years. For illustration, we adopt this rule of thumb estimate in the rest of this section. Thus, in our example, if half of the  $20\%$  gap is likely to be closed over five years, then over five years,  $q$  would rise by approximately  $10\%$  from 0.5 to 0.55, an increase of about  $2\%$  per year.

Trend The second step is to figure out whether  $\tilde{q}$  is a moving target and forecast what its trend rate of growth will be. The Balassa-Samuelson theory shows how. In our example, suppose that the home country is expected to grow rapidly, with GDP per capita and wages rising; then  $\tilde{q}$  could be much higher than 0.6 in five years' time. For example, if the nontraded share is 0.4, then Equation (22-1) says that a country's  $\tilde{q}$  will rise  $0.4\%$  for every  $1\%$  of real GDP per capita growth in excess of the U.S. growth rate. So if a country is growing at, say,  $8\%$  per year faster than the United States, then  $\tilde{q}$  should be rising by  $0.4 \times 8\%$ , or  $3.2\%$  per year.

Convergence + Trend For this numerical example, we would conclude that the observed real exchange rate  $q$  is likely to increase at  $2\%$  per year toward its equilibrium and to increase at a further  $3.2\%$  a year due to the upward drift of that equilibrium, resulting in a predicted real appreciation for the foreign country at a rate of about  $2 + 3.2 = 5.2\%$  per year. (Note that adding growth rates in this way is only an approximation.)

Forecasting the Nominal Exchange Rate This kind of real exchange rate forecast can then help us predict nominal exchange rates, an essential component in the asset approach to exchange rates. How?

By definition, the real exchange rate is  $q = EP^{*} / P$ ; by rearranging, we find  $E = qP / P^{*}$ , and we have an expression for the nominal exchange rate. When PPP holds, this equation becomes  $E = P / P^{*}$ : under PPP, the real exchange rate  $q$  equals 1, and the exchange rate is equal to the ratio of national price levels.

When PPP doesn't bold, however, we have to worry about possible changes in  $q$ . Since  $E = qP / P^{*}$ , then taking rates of change, we find

$$
\underbrace {\frac {\Delta E}{E}} _ {\text {R a t e o f}} = \underbrace {\frac {\Delta q}{q}} _ {\text {R a t e o f}} + \underbrace {\left(\frac {\Delta P}{P} - \frac {\Delta P ^ {*}}{P ^ {*}}\right)} _ {\text {I n f l a t i o n d i f f e r e n t i a l}} \tag {22-2}
$$

In the long-run exchange rates chapter, we saw a simpler version of this expression: PPP forced  $q$  to be constant and equal to 1, and the first term on the right vanished. We were left with a result, known as relative PPP, which says that changes in nominal exchange rates depend on inflation differentials alone. Taken literally, forecasters can then focus just on inflation forecasts.

When the Balassa-Samuelson effect is present, PPP fails, but we can still forecast future exchange rate changes using Equation (22-2). In using this equation, however, we not only have to forecast inflation, we have to forecast changes in the real exchange rate, too. Thus, in real-world financial markets, foreign exchange traders have to pay attention to many macroeconomic forecasts before forming an expectation about how  $E$  is likely to evolve over time.

Adjustment to Equilibrium Finally, we note that the Balassa-Samuelson model does not tell us how the real exchange rate will adjust. Suppose we have forecast a  $1\%$  real appreciation  $(-1\%$  change in  $q$ ). In Equation (22-2), this could imply either a  $1\%$  nominal appreciation  $(-1\%$  on the left) or an extra  $1\%$  of home inflation over and above foreign inflation  $(+1\%$  on the right), or some combination of the two.

Thus:

If the model says there is currently a real undervaluation, either home goods prices have to rise or the value of the home currency has to rise—there is no other way to make home goods more expensive.

If the model says there is currently a real overvaluation, either home goods prices have to fall or the value of the home currency has to fall—there is no other way to make home goods less expensive.

# APPLICATION

# Real Exchange Rates in Emerging Markets

To see how we can use these ideas to make forecasts of real and nominal exchange rates, we examine three cases in Figure 22-3 that were in the news a few years ago. The data we use are for the year 2000, which allows us to look at subsequent events and see how well the predictions of the model turned out in the following years.

China: Yuan Undervaluation? The Balassa-Samuelson model predictions: in 2000 the real exchange rate with China was  $q = 0.231$ , well below (0.088 below) the predicted equilibrium level of  $\tilde{q} = 0.319$ . The yuan was undervalued according to the model and would have to experience a  $38\%$  real appreciation (0.088/0.231) against the U.S. dollar to close the gap. Using our old rule of thumb, half of this gap or  $19\%$  would be eliminated in five years, implying an approximate  $3.5\%$  annual increase in  $q$  due to convergence.

However, in addition, China was a fast-growing economy at this time and its GDP per capita was growing about  $6\%$  per annum faster than U.S. GDP per capita. So the real exchange rate would have to appreciate even more due to Balassa-Samuelson effects.

Figure 22-3 suggests that every  $1\%$  gain in GDP per capita is associated with an approximate  $0.4\%$  real appreciation (as expected if the nontraded share were 0.4). So a  $6\%$  differential growth rate per year (China minus United States) would imply a further  $0.4 \times 6 = 2.4\%$  per year real appreciation in the yuan due to the trend of the moving target.[5]

What actually happened: Adding up both effects, the model predicts a real yuan appreciation of  $3.5 + 2.4 = 5.9\%$  per year. As noted previously, this would imply either a nominal appreciation of the yuan against the dollar, or higher inflation in China. Inflation did start to rise in China, up to as much as  $4.1\%$  in 2004, although the data are not considered terribly accurate. This was not that much higher than U.S. inflation. Until mid-2005 China pegged the yuan to the dollar but then decided to switch to an unofficial crawling peg, allowing the yuan to appreciate gradually against the dollar, but very slowly. Many commentators saw this as a response to protectionist pressure in the United States, where cheap Chinese imports were raising hackles. But the Chinese had reasons of their own to let the yuan rise: to keep domestic inflation at a reasonable level.

Argentina: Was the Peso Overvalued? The Balassa-Samuelson model predictions: Figure 22-3 clearly shows that Argentina's currency was overvalued in 2000: Argentina's price level was 0.656, but the predicted equilibrium level of  $\tilde{q}$  was 0.512. For a country at that level of GDP per capita, Argentina's dollar prices would have had to fall by  $22\%$  to reach that equilibrium. Argentina's growth had slowed after 1998, so, unlike in the China case, very little rise in the equilibrium  $\tilde{q}$  could have been expected (which would have mitigated the need for a fall in actual  $q$ ).

What actually happened: Argentina was pegging the peso to the dollar at 1:1, so adjustment had to come through a fall in Argentine prices relative to U.S. prices. With U.S. inflation at only  $2\%$ , this would happen slowly unless Argentine prices actually dropped. Unfortunately, this deflation process was slow and politically painful, involving wage and price cuts in an economy that was far from liberalized and competitive. The overvalued exchange rate was also hurting the demand for Argentine goods. Although the peg held for a long time, the country was driven into crisis by fiscal and financial sector problems. In the crisis of 2001-02, the peso depreciated to three per dollar: the overvaluation was eliminated, and then some.

Slovakia: Obeying the Rules? The Balassa-Samuelson model predictions: Figure 22-3 also shows Slovakia. Like China, Slovakia was a fast-growing country, part of a group of countries in Eastern Europe lined up to join the European Union (EU) and ultimately the Eurozone. Slovakia's real exchange rate was  $q = 0.282$  in 2000 and undervalued relative to the predicted equilibrium  $\tilde{q} = 0.534$ . Here,  $q$  needed to rise by  $89\%$  to reach equilibrium. Using our rule of thumb, half of this gap, or  $45\%$ , would be closed in five years, implying a real appreciation of about  $7.5\%$  per year. In addition, fast GDP per capita growth relative to the EU probably added another  $1\%$  to  $2\%$  on top of that, as in the China case, as a result of the moving target. Thus, the expected real appreciation would have been  $8\%$  to  $10\%$  per year.

What actually happened: Slovakia notched up high rates of real appreciation of between  $5\%$  and  $10\%$  per annum from 1992 to 2004, as did many other countries in Eastern Europe. The situation was like that in China: it required some combination of nominal appreciation and inflation. But Slovakia (and many of its neighbors) also wanted to join the euro. As we saw in the chapter on the euro, the Maastricht criteria would require Slovakia to peg to the euro (no appreciation) and keep its inflation within limits (within  $2\%$  of the "best" in the EU). Our model suggests this would be impossible: the koruna would have to appreciate or Slovakia's inflation would have to accelerate! As an exercise, you may wish to explore in more detail what actually happened. (See the second Net Work problem at the end of this chapter.)

# Conclusion

In general, PPP does not hold. Goods prices are not the same in all countries. Arbitrage fails, most likely because of trade costs. The Balassa-Samuelson theory can explain how prices vary when goods are not traded and why rich countries have higher price levels. As countries get richer, their wages rise, driving up the prices of their nontraded goods (which use local labor as an input). This will drive up the overall price index and will cause the real exchange rate to fall—that is, a real appreciation. The theory finds strong empirical support and can be used to make better models of real and (hence) nominal exchange rates, with improved predictions, in situations in which an assumption of PPP is inappropriate.

# 2 Exchange Rates in the Short Run: Deviations from Uncovered Interest Parity

When we studied exchange rates in the short run, we examined interest arbitrage in the forex market and introduced uncovered interest parity (UIP), the fundamental condition for forex market equilibrium. Recall that UIP states the expected return on foreign deposits should equal the return on domestic deposits when both are expressed in domestic currency.

For such an important foundation of exchange rate theory, however, UIP remains subject to considerable debate among international macroeconomists. The topic is important because any failure of UIP would affect our theories about exchange rates and the wider economy. For that reason, in this section we further explore the UIP debate to better understand the mechanism of arbitrage in the forex market.

# APPLICATION

# The Carry Trade

Uncovered interest parity (UIP) implies that the home interest rate should equal the foreign interest rate plus the rate of depreciation of the home currency. If UIP holds, it would seem to rule out the naive strategy of borrowing in a low interest rate currency and investing in a high interest rate currency, an investment referred to as a carry trade. In other words, UIP implies that the expected profit from such a trade is zero:

$$
\text {E x p e c t e d} = \underbrace {i _ {F}} _ {\substack {\text {I n t e r s t r a t e} \\ \text {o n f o r g i n c u r r e n c y}}} + \underbrace {\frac {\Delta E _ {H / F} ^ {e}}{E _ {H / F}}} _ {\substack {\text {E x p e c t e d r a t e o f d e p r e c i a t i o n} \\ \text {o f t h e h o m e c u r r e n c y}}} - \underbrace {i _ {H}} _ {\substack {\text {I n t e r s t r a t e} \\ \text {o n h o m e c u r r e n c y} \\ \text {C o s t o f c a r r y}}} \tag{22-3}
$$

From the home perspective, the return to an investment in the foreign currency (the foreign return) consists of the first two terms on the right-hand side of the preceding equation. Let's suppose the foreign currency (that of Australia, say) has a high interest rate of  $6\%$ . Now suppose the home country (Japan, say) has a low interest rate of  $1\%$ . The final term in the preceding equation is the cost of borrowing funds in local currency (Japanese yen) or, in financial jargon, the cost of carry. The interest rate differential,  $5\%$ , would be the profit on the carry trade if the exchange rate remained unchanged. If UIP is true, however, it would be pointless to engage in such arbitrage because the low-yield currency (the yen) would be expected to appreciate by  $5\%$  against the high-yield currency (the Australian dollar). The exchange rate term would be  $-5\%$ , leaving zero expected profit.

The Long and Short of It In the past decade or two, the predominant low interest rate currencies in the world economy have been the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, and carry traders have often borrowed ("gone short") in these currencies and made an investment ("gone long") in higher interest rate major currencies such as the U.S. dollar, pound sterling, euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar. The profits from these trades have been very large. Has UIP failed?

To grasp how a carry trade functions, Figure 22-4, panel (a), shows actual monthly profits (in percent per month) from a carry trade based on borrowing low-interest yen in the Japanese money market and investing the proceeds in a high-interest Australian dollar money market account for one month. Also shown are the cumulative profits (in yen) that would have accrued from a ¥100 carry trade initiated on January 1, 1992. Panel (b) shows the underlying data used to calculate these returns. We see that over this entire period, the annual Australian dollar interest rate exceeded the Japanese yen interest rate, often by five or six percentage points. Thus, returns would be positive for this strategy if the yen depreciated or even appreciated only slightly against the Australian dollar. But if the yen appreciated more than slightly in any month, returns would be negative, and losses would result.

Panel (a) shows that in many months the high interest being paid on the Australian dollar was not offset by yen appreciation, and the carry trade resulted in a profit; this pattern was seen frequently in the period from 1995 to 1996, for example. There were other periods, however, when a sharp yen appreciation far exceeded the interest differential, and the carry trade resulted in a loss; this pattern occurred quite a bit in late 1998 and again during the global financial crisis of 2008. In 1998, for example, in each of three months, in fact—August, October, and December 1998—the Australian dollar lost about  $10\%$  in value, wiping out the profits from two years' worth of interest differentials in all three cases. Overall, we see that the periods of positive and negative returns were driven not by the fairly stable interest differential seen in panel (b), but by the long and volatile swings in the exchange rate.

To sum up, the carry trade strategy was subject to a good deal of volatility, and over the decade from the start of 1992 to the end of 2001, the highs and lows canceled each other out in the long run. On November 1, 2001, for example, the average return on this carry trade was virtually zero. Cumulative interest since 1992 on the two currencies expressed in yen was virtually the same, about  $13\%$ . Over that period, 100 yen placed in either currency at the start would have been worth 113 yen by the end.

What happened after that date? Subsequent trends again caused the value of Australian investment to pull ahead, as can be seen in panel (a) by the mostly positive returns registered month after month from 2002 to 2006. By June 2007

(b) Key Indicators

Carry Trades In the 1990s and 2000s, the yen had a lower interest rate than many other currencies. Carry trades borrow in low-yield yen to invest in higher-yield currencies like the Australian dollar. Such trades can be profitable for long periods, but dramatic reversals, though rare, can quickly undermine profits.

cumulative profits were well over ¥100. The reason? As panel (b) shows, the yen persistently weakened against the Australian dollar over this five-year period (by about 6\% to 7\% per year), reinforcing the interest differential (about 6\% to 7\% also) rather than offsetting it. Adding up, from 2002 to 2006 the cumulative return on the carry trade was about 15\% per year! Would that trend continue or was there to be another sudden swing resulting from yen appreciation? As we can see, another wipeout came along in 2008. This question brings us to a consideration of the role of risk in the forex market.

Investors face very real risks in this market. Suppose you put up  \$1,000 of your own capital and borrow\$ 19,000 in yen from a bank. You now have 20 times your capital, a ratio, or leverage, of 20 (not uncommon). Then you play the carry trade, investing the \$20,000 in the Australian dollar. It takes only a 5\% loss on this trade to wipe you out: 5\% of \$20,000 eats all your capital. And without that margin to back you up, the bank bids you goodbye. As we have seen, losing 5\% in a month is quite possible, as is losing 10\% or even 15\%.

For policy makers and market participants, the broader fear is that while big losses for households would be bad enough, big losses at large, high-leverage financial institutions could have damaging spillover effects in the global macroeconomy. For example, in June 2007, Jim O'Neill, Goldman Sachs chief global economist, said investment firms had been caught on the wrong side of huge bets against the Japanese yen: "There has been an amazing amount of leverage on currency markets that has nothing to do with real economic activity. I think there are going to be dead bodies around when this is over. The yen carry trade has reached  $5\%$  of Japan's GDP. This is enormous and highly risky, as we are now seeing."7 Days later Steven Pearson, chief currency strategist at HBOS bank, said, "A sizeable reversal at some point is highly likely, but the problem with that statement is the 'at some point' bit, because carry trades make money steadily over long periods of time."8

In the carry trade, as history shows, a big reversal can always happen as everyone rushes to exit the carry trades and they all "unwind" their positions at the same time. The answer to the dangling question above is yes, a big reversal did come along for the trade in question: after rising another  $10\%$  against the yen from January to July 2007, the Australian dollar then fell by  $15\%$  in the space of a month, eating up about three years' worth of interest differential for anyone unlucky enough to buy in at the peak. Many hedge funds and individual investors who made ill-timed or excessively leveraged bets lost a bundle (see Headlines: Mrs. Watanabe's Hedge Fund).

Still, given the persistence of profits, anyone predicting such reversals may appear to be crying wolf. Money managers often face incentives to follow the herd and the market's momentum keeps the profits flowing—until they stop. All this ensures high levels of stress and uncertainty for anyone in the forex trading world and for some of the households engaged in this kind of risky arbitrage.

**Carry Trade Summary** Our study of the carry trade focuses our attention on several facts. First, even if expected returns from arbitrage are zero, actual realized returns are often not zero. Second, such returns appear to be persistent. Third, the returns are also very volatile, or risky. All of these issues need to be addressed as we judge the success or failure of UIP.

The example of carry trades between the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar shows how actual returns from interest arbitrage may be nonzero (but risky) for a pair of currencies that are floating. But the same can be true for two currencies that are fixed.

# HEADLINES

# Mrs. Watanabe's Hedge Fund

The OECD estimated the total yen carry trade at 4 trillion in 2006. This trade involves not just large financial institutions but increasing numbers of Japanese individual investors, who place money in high-yielding foreign currency deposits or uridashi bonds.

TOKYO—Since the credit crisis started shaking the world financial markets this summer, many professional traders have taken big losses. Another, less likely group of investors has, too: middle-class Japanese homemakers who moonlight as amateur currency speculators.

Ms. Itoh is one of them. Ms. Itoh, a homemaker in the central city of Nagoya, did not want her full name used because her husband still does not know. After cleaning the dinner dishes, she would spend her evenings buying and selling British pounds and Australian dollars.

When the turmoil struck the currency markets last month, Ms. Itoh spent a sleepless week as market losses wiped out her holdings. She lost nearly all her family's 100,000 in savings.

"I wanted to add to our savings, but instead I got in over my head," Ms. Itoh, 36, said.

Tens of thousands of married Japanese women ventured into online currency trading in the last year and a half, playing the markets between household chores or after tucking the children into bed. While the overwhelmingly male world of traders and investors here mocked them as kimono-clad "Mrs. Watanabes," these women collectively emerged as a powerful force, using Japan's vast wealth to sway prices and confound economists…

Now Japan's homemaker-traders may become yet another casualty of the shakeout hitting the debt, credit and stock markets worldwide… . Most analysts estimate that Japanese online investors lost 2.5 billion trading currency last month…

Some of the women used their own money, some used their husband's, and some used a combination of both. But by trading, they challenged deeply held social prohibitions in Japan against money, which is often seen here as dirty, especially when earned through market speculation.

"There are strict taboos against money that isn't earned with sweat from the brow," said Mayumi Torii, a 41-year-old mother of one who said she earned 150,000 since she started margin trading in currencies early last year.

Ms. Torii is one of Japan's most famous housewife-traders. She has written a book on her investing strategies and founded a support group for home traders, the FX Beauties Club, which now has 40 members. (FX is financial shorthand for "foreign exchange.") . .

One reason Japan's homemakers can move markets is that they hold the purse strings of the nation's 12.5 trillion in household savings. For more than a decade, that money languished in banks here at low interest rates. But as the rapid aging of Japan's population has brought anxiety about the future, households are starting to move more of it overseas in search of higher returns.

A tiny fraction of this has flowed into risky investments like online currency accounts. Most of these accounts involve margin trading, in which investors place a cash deposit with a brokerage that allows them to borrow up to 20 or even 100 times their holdings for trading.

The practice has been popular not only because it vastly raises the level

"FX Beauties" founder Mayumi Torii of potential profits, but also because it allowed wives to trade at home, said Hiroshi Takao, chief operating officer of TokyoForex, an online trading firm.

The housewife-traders were so secretive that many market analysts did not realize how widespread the trend had become until this summer, when the police arrested a Tokyo housewife accused of failing to pay 1.1 million in taxes on her foreign exchange earnings… .

For a time, margin trading seemed like a surefire way to make money, as the yen moved only downward against the dollar and other currencies. But last month, in the midst of the credit turmoil, the yen soared as hedge funds and traders panicked.

Ms. Itoh recalled that she had wanted to cry as she watched the yen jump as much as 5 percent in value in a single day, Aug. 16.

"But I had to keep a poker face, because my husband was sitting behind me," Ms. Itoh said.

She did not sell her position, thinking the yen would fall again. But by the next morning, only 1,000 remained in her account, she said…

[M]ost of the half dozen homemaker-traders interviewed for this article said they were already trading again, and the rest said they soon would be—including Ms. Itoh, who said she would probably invest her remaining 1,000 in savings.

"There's no other way to make money so quickly," she said.

To illustrate this case, we turn to recent data involving the U.S. dollar pegs of two emerging market countries, Hong Kong and Argentina.

As we saw in the chapter on fixed and floating regimes, in the case of a credibly fixed peg with no risk of a depreciation or any other risks (no currency premium and no default risk premium), the UIP condition states that the home interest rate should equal the foreign interest rate because investors treat domestic and foreign currency as perfect substitutes that always have been and always will be interchangeable at a fixed rate. Thus, the interest differential between the two currencies should be zero. Again, if true, this outcome would seem to rule out any desire on the part of investors to engage in arbitrage (e.g., via the carry trade). But there is an important exception: when pegs are not credible, risk premiums can cause large interest differentials—and cause investors to smell a profit.

Figure 22-5, panel (a), shows data for Hong Kong from 1990 to 2001, including the crucial period in 1997 when many Asian countries were in crisis and their exchange rate pegs were breaking. Most of the time, the interest differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar was zero, as one would expect for what was perceived to be a credible peg. Hong Kong was operating a quasi-currency board with reserves

(b) Argentine Peso Interest Rate Minus U.S. Dollar Interest Rate

Peso Problems If exchange rates are fixed (and credible), then the interest rate on the home currency and the base currency should be the same. As seen here, however, the Hong Kong dollar and Argentina peso often had large currency premiums. Hong Kong's peg held, and carry trade profits were made. Argentina's peg broke, and losses were massive.

of approximately  $300\%$  of the (base) money supply. Short of dollarization, this was considered about the most bulletproof peg around.

Nonetheless, in late 1997 investors started to fear that Hong Kong might suffer the same fate as other Asian economies. Expecting a future depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar, they started to demand a currency premium. At its peak, the Hong Kong interest rate rose almost 20 percentage points per year above the U.S. interest rate in late October, and the spread exceeded 5 percentage points for over three weeks.. However, the expected depreciation never happened. The Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar survived. Investors may have been reasonable to fear a crisis and demand a premium beforehand (ex ante), but after the fact (ex post), these unrealized expectations became realized profits. As a result, there was a lot of money to be made from the carry trade for those willing to park their money in Hong Kong dollars during all the fuss.

Should you always bet on a peg to hold in a crisis? No. Figure 22-5, panel (b), shows data for Argentina from 1991 to 2001. This includes the period of looming crisis for the Argentine economy in 2001, as the likelihood of default and depreciation grew. The country was in fiscal trouble with an ailing banking sector. It no longer had the ability to borrow in world capital markets and was about to be cut off from International Monetary Fund assistance. A recession was deepening. All of this was raising the pressure on the government to use monetary policy for purposes other than maintaining the peg. Investors began to demand a huge currency-plus-default premium on Argentine peso deposits to compensate them for the risk of a possible depreciation and/or banking crisis. Peso interest rates at one point were more than  $25\%$  above the U.S. interest rate. But in this case, investors' fears were justified: in December 2000 to January 2001 the Argentine government froze bank deposits, imposed capital controls, and the peg broke. The peso's value plummeted, and soon the exchange rate exceeded three pesos to the dollar, erasing more than two-thirds of the U.S. dollar value of peso deposits. In retrospect, the precrisis interest differentials had been too small: the carry traders who gambled and left their money in peso deposits eventually lost their shirts.

We can now see how expectations may not be realized, even when exchange rates are fixed. Fixed exchange rates often break, and investors may reasonably demand currency premiums at certain times. However, after the fact, such premiums may lead to returns from interest arbitrage that are positive (when pegs hold, as in the

Hong Kong case) or negative (when pegs break, as in the Argentine case).

International economists refer to this phenomenon as the peso problem (given its common occurrence in a certain region of the world). But again, it is far from clear that the profits seen are a sign that UIP fails or that investors are acting irrationally. The collapse of a peg can be seen as a rare event, an extreme occurrence that is hard to predict but that will lead to large changes in the values of assets. This situation is not unlike, say, fire or earthquake insurance: every year that you pay the premium and nothing happens, you make a "loss" on the insurance arrangement, a pattern that could go on for years (hopefully, for your entire life), but you know that the insurance will pay off to your advantage in a big way if disaster strikes.

Do carry trade profits disprove UIP? To explore this question further, let us rewrite Equation (22-3), which calculates expected profits, by replacing expected or ex ante values of the exchange rate with actual or ex post realized values.

$$
\text {A c t u a l p r o f i t} = \underbrace {i _ {F}} _ {\substack {\text {I n t e r s t r a t e} \\ \text {o n f o r g i n c u r r e n c y}}} + \underbrace {\frac {\Delta E _ {H / F}}{E _ {H / F}}} _ {\substack {\text {A c t u a l r a t e o f d e p r e c i a t i o n} \\ \text {o f t h e h o m e c u r r e n c y}}} - \underbrace {i _ {H}} _ {\substack {\text {I n t e r s t r a t e} \\ \text {o n h o m e c u r r e n c y}}} (2 2 - 4)
$$

Note the one subtle difference: the disappearance of the superscript " $e,$ " which denoted expectations of future exchange rate depreciation. This expression can be computed only after the fact: although interest rates are known in advance, the future exchange rate is not. We know actual profits only after the investment strategy has run its course.

Thus, the sole difference between actual and expected profits is a forecast error that corresponds to the difference between actual depreciation and expected depreciation. (Again, the importance of exchange rate forecasts is revealed!) This forecast error is the difference between Equation (22-3) and Equation (22-4), that is,

$$
\text {F o r e c a s t} = \binom {\text {A c t u a l}} {\text {p r o f i t}} - \binom {\text {E x p e c t e d}} {\text {p r o f i t}} = \frac {\Delta E _ {H / F}}{E _ {H / F}} - \frac {\Delta E _ {H / F} ^ {e}}{E _ {H / F}} \tag {22-5}
$$

Armed with this way of understanding unexpected profits, we can now confront an important and controversial puzzle in international macroeconomics: What can the behavior of this forecast error tell us about UIP and the workings of the forex market? One way to attack that question is to study expected and actual profits side by side to see the size of the forecast error and its pattern of behavior.

Expected Profits On the one hand, strictly speaking, UIP itself says nothing about the forecast error. It says only that before that fact, or ex ante, expected profits should be zero. Expectations are not directly observable in markets, but we can recall the evidence presented in the chapter on exchange rates in the short run based on surveys of traders' expectations for major currencies from 1988 to 1993. As a recap, Figure 22-6, panel (a), presents this evidence again. The figure plots the expected depreciation against the interest differential for several major currencies.

On the 45-degree line, these two terms are equal, and expected profits will be zero, according to Equation (22-3). As in several studies of this sort, on average, the data are aligned close to, but not exactly on, the 45-degree line, so they are not wildly inconsistent with UIP. The line-of-best-fit slope is close to 1. But the survey data are probably prone to error and cover only some (but not all) of the traders in the market. Even using formal statistical tests, it is difficult to reject UIP based on shaky evidence of this sort. The hypothesis that UIP holds can typically survive this kind of test.

Actual Profits On the other hand, we know that actual profits are made. It is enlightening to see exactly how they are made by replacing the expected depreciation in panel (a) with actual depreciation, after the fact, or ex post. This change is made in

UIP and the Efficient Markets Hypothesis Each dot represents an actual 12-month period for a given currency versus the U.S. dollar. According to trader surveys, expected depreciations were, on average, more or less in line with UIP, as seen in panel (a), where the slope is not far from 1. But panel (b) shows that, after the fact, these forecasts were not very good, and systematically wrong, in this sample. Actual depreciations were far out of line with expectations: the slope is only 0.23. On average, high-yield currencies systematically depreciated only  $23\%$  as much as the interest differential would have forecast under UIP.

panel (b), which, to be consistent, shows actual profits for the same currencies over the same period.

The change is dramatic. There are plenty of observations not on the 45-degree line, indicating that profits and losses were made in some periods. Even more striking, the line of best fit has a slope of about 0.2. This means that for every  $1\%$  of interest differential in favor of the foreign currency, we would expect only a  $0.2\%$  appreciation of the home currency, on average, leaving a profit of  $0.8\%$ . At larger interest differentials, the line of best fit means even larger profits. (Some studies find zero, or even negative slopes, implying even bigger profits!)

The UIP Puzzle A finding that profits can be made needs careful handling. On its own, this need not imply a violation of UIP: random profits could arise due to variation about a zero mean. However, looking at actual profits, the pattern of the deviations from the 45-degree line is systematic. The slope of the best-fit line is well below 1, indicating, for example, that when the interest differential is high, actual depreciation is typically less than expected and less than the interest differential. In other words, on average, the carry trade (borrowing in the low-yield currency to invest in the high-yield currency) is profitable. Actual profits are risky, but they appear to be forecastable.

This finding is widely considered to be a puzzle or anomaly. If such profits are forecastable, then the forex market would be violating some of the fundamental tenets of the modern theory of finance. The rational expectations hypothesis argues that, on average, all investors should make forecasts about the future that are without bias: on average, actual and expected values should correspond. But, as we just saw, the difference between actual and expected exchange rates reveals a clear bias.

In addition, the efficient markets hypothesis, developed by economist Eugene Fama, asserts that financial markets are "informationally efficient" in that all prices reflect all known information at any given time. Hence, such information should not be useful in forecasting future profits: that is, one should not be able to systematically beat the market.

Ultimately then, the UIP puzzle isn't just about UIP. The expectations data (the best that we have) suggest that UIP does hold. The real UIP puzzle is why UIP combined with the rational expectations and efficient markets hypotheses fails to hold. Yet these hypotheses seemingly do fail. This appears to be an inefficient market instead. Why are those big forecastable profits lying around?

# Limits to Arbitrage

Economists have proposed a number of ways to resolve these puzzles, and at some level all of these can be described as explanations based on a limits to arbitrage argument. What does this mean? In the first section of this chapter, we argued that there were limits to arbitrage, in the form of trade costs, that can help explain the PPP puzzle: purchasing power parity will not hold if there are frictions such as transport costs, tariffs, and so on that hamper arbitrage in goods markets.

Limits to arbitrage arguments can also be applied in the world of finance. But how? And can they help explain the UIP puzzle?

Trade Costs Are Small It is tempting but ultimately not fruitful to look for the same kinds of frictions that we saw in goods markets. Conventional trade costs in financial markets are simply too small to have an effect that is large enough to explain the puzzle. There are bid-ask spreads between currencies, and there may be other technical trading costs, for example, associated with when a forex trade is placed during the day and which financial markets are open. But none of these frictions provides a sufficient explanation for the forecastable profits and the market's inefficiency.

There is also the problem that if one wishes to make a very large transaction, especially in a less liquid currency, the act of trading itself may have an adverse impact on the exchange rate and curtail profitable trades. For example, an order for  \$1 billion of more liquid yen is more easily digested by the market than an order for\$ 1 billion of less liquid New Zealand dollars. But again, this possibility is not likely to explain the UIP puzzle because investors can avert such a situation by breaking their trades up into small pieces and spreading them out over time. So even though these trading costs are real, they may not be large enough to offset the very substantial profits we have seen.

If trading costs are the sole limit to arbitrage, there is still a puzzle. We must look elsewhere.

Risk Versus Reward A promising approach to the puzzle examines traders' alternative investment strategies, draws on other puzzles in finance, is based less on introspection and more on observations of actual trading strategies, and connects with the frontiers of the emerging field of behavioral economics.

To approach this research and to make the investment problem facing the trader a little clearer, we can reconsider the data shown in Figure 22-6. In panel (b) we saw that the slope was only  $0.23$ , meaning that for every  $1\%$  of interest differential, we would predict only  $0.23\%$  of offsetting depreciation, leaving a seemingly predictable profit of  $0.77\%$ . Suppose we followed a carry trade strategy of borrowing in the low interest rate currency and investing in the high-interest currency. If the interest differential were  $1\%$ , then we would expect to net a profit of  $0.77\%$ ; if the interest differential were  $2\%$ , we would expect to double that profit to  $1.54\%$ ; a differential of  $3\%$  would yield  $2.31\%$  profit, and so on, if we simply extrapolate that straight line.

This strategy would have delivered profits. However, there are two problems with it. First, profits do not, in fact, grow linearly with the interest differential. The straight-line model is a poor fit. At high-interest differentials there are times when profits are very good, and other times when the carry trade suffers a reversal, and large losses accrue, as we have seen. The second problem is a related one. At all levels of the interest differential, Figure 22-6 clearly shows the extreme volatility or riskiness of these returns due to the extreme and unpredictable volatility of the exchange rate. Actual rates of depreciation can easily range between plus or minus  $10\%$  per year, and up to plus or minus  $30\%$  in some cases.

One measure of the volatility of returns used by economists is the standard deviation, which we can now put to use to explore why these positive but risky profits are left unexploited.

The Sharpe Ratio and Puzzles in Finance Carry trade profits are the difference between a risky foreign return and a safe domestic interest rate. This kind of return difference is called an excess return, and to analyze it further, we can draw on one of the standard tools of financial economics.

The Sharpe ratio is the ratio of an asset's average annualized excess return to the annualized standard deviation of its return:

$$
\text {S h a r p e} = \frac {\text {M e a n (a n n u a l e x c e s s r e t u r n)}}{\text {S t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n (a n n u a l e x c e s s r e t u r n)}}
$$

The ratio was invented by William Forsyth Sharpe, a Nobel laureate in economics. As a ratio of "rewards to variability," the Sharpe ratio tells us how much the returns on an asset compensate investors for the risks they take when investing in it.

Figure 22-7 displays data on returns to the simple carry trade strategy for several major currencies against the British pound for the period 1976 to 2005. For each pair of currencies, it is assumed that each month a trader would have borrowed in the low interest rate currency and invested in the high interest rate currency. Details on the returns to a portfolio of all such trades (equally weighted) are also shown.

In panel (a) we see that the returns to these strategies were positive for all currencies (they were also statistically significant), and, on average, they were about  $4\%$  per year. However, the volatility of the returns was even larger in all cases, as measured by the standard deviation. On average, this was about  $10\%$  on an annual basis, although falling to  $6\%$  for the portfolio (due to gains from diversification). In panel (b) the corresponding Sharpe ratios are shown, and we can see that they fall below 1 in all cases. The average for all currencies is 0.4 and, thanks to a reduction in volatility due to diversification, the equally weighted portfolio has a modestly higher Sharpe ratio of 0.6.

We now must ask: Should Sharpe ratios of around 0.5 be considered "big" or "small"? Do they signal that investors are missing a profit opportunity? Should people be rushing to take profits in investments that offer this mix of risk and reward? If this can be judged to be a "big" Sharpe ratio, then we have a puzzle as the market would seem to be failing in terms of efficiency.

# Risk Versus Reward in the Carry

Trade This chart shows details of returns for carry trades between the British pound and selected foreign currencies (and an equally weighted portfolio of all such trades). The strategy supposes that each month an investor borrowed in the low interest rate currency and invested in the high interest rate currency, and transaction costs are assumed to be negligible. Panel (a) shows that there have been predictable excess returns to the carry trade based on data from 1976 to 2005, on average, about  $4\%$  per year. However, the standard deviation of these returns has been substantial, at about  $10\%$  per year. Thus, the average Sharpe ratio for this strategy has been about 0.4, as shown in panel (b). The diversified portfolio does a little better with a Sharpe ratio of 0.6.

Note: Returns and Sharpe ratios are annualized.

Source: Craig Burnside et al., 2006, "The Returns to Currency Speculation," NBER Working Paper 12489. Monthly means, standard deviations, and Sharpe ratios have been annualized.

It turns out that many investors in the forex market would consider that 0.5 is a fairly small Sharpe ratio. To see why, and to understand how this approach may "solve" the UIP puzzle, we note that historically, as shown in panel (b), the annual Sharpe ratio for the U.S. stock market has been about 0.48, based on the excess returns of the broad S&P 500 index over and above risk-free U.S. Treasury bonds. This reference level of 0.48 might be thought of as a hurdle that competing investment strategies must beat if they are to attract additional investment. But we can see from panel (b) that forex carry trades either fall below this bar, or just barely surmount it.

There are indeed excess returns in the stock market, but investors are not rushing to borrow money to buy stocks to push that Sharpe ratio any lower. Admittedly, many economists consider the stock market finding to be a puzzle (called the equity premium puzzle) because under various standard theories and assumptions about risk aversion, it is hard to understand why investors sit back and leave such excess returns on the table. And yet they do, a fact that leads other economists to postulate that some very nonstandard assumptions, some drawn from psychology, may now need to be included in models to properly explain investor behavior. Research in behavioral finance, a branch of behavioral economics, attempts to explain such seemingly irrational market outcomes using various principles such as rational action under different preferences (e.g., strong aversion to loss) or more limited forms of rationality (e.g., models with slow or costly learning).

To sum up, there are now theories that might explain why nobody arbitrages the stock market when its Sharpe ratio is 0.48. That just isn't a high enough reward-risk ratio to attract investors. But in our forex market data, the Sharpe ratio is about the same, and most other studies find carry trade Sharpe ratios that are little larger than the stock market's 0.48.[10] So we may have an answer to the question why arbitrage does not erase all excess returns. The ratio of rewards to risk is so very small that investors in the market are simply uninterested. Indeed, surveys of trader behavior in major firms by economist Richard Lyons suggest that, in the forex market, if the predicted Sharpe ratio of a strategy falls below even 1, then this is enough to discourage investor interest.[11]

Predictability and Nonlinearity Can we do better than a straight-line model or linear predictions of returns and crude carry trade strategies? More complex and diversified forex trading strategies may be able to jack up the Sharpe ratio a little, but not too much. As an alternative way of describing the data, for example, we can use nonlinear models that fit the data quite well.[12]

Nonlinear models show that at low interest differentials (say,  $0\%$  to  $2\%$ ), profits are inherently low, and nobody has been much interested in arbitrage given the risks; conversely, at high differentials (say,  $5\%$  or more), the rewards have often vanished as investors have rushed in, bid up the high-yield currency to its maximum value, causing a reversal that wipes out carry trade profits. At the extremes, arbitrage has tended to work when it should (or shouldn't). Only in the middle do moderate, positive Sharpe ratios emerge, it seems, for investors willing to take some risks. Thus, our "small" average Sharpe ratios are a mix of these low and high returns, suggesting more sophisticated strategies should ensure that the investment decision depends on the size of the expected return. But the rewards relative to risk are still quite meager and Sharpe ratios are still fairly low even when arbitrage looks most promising.

# Conclusion

The main lesson here is that risky arbitrage is fundamentally different from riskless arbitrage. Based on this sort of standard financial analysis, many economists conclude that although there may be excess returns, even predictable excess returns, in the forex market, the risk-reward ratio is typically too low to attract additional investors.[13] In that sense, there is no puzzle left and arbitrage has not failed—it has just gone as far as might be reasonably expected, at least given investor behavior in equity markets and elsewhere. In forex market research, nobody has yet proved that there are large amounts of low-risk money lying on the table (though if they did, they might not publish the result).

What are the implications? Here, there is common ground between the UIP and PPP puzzles. In the case of the PPP puzzle studied earlier in the chapter, limits to arbitrage in the goods market (mainly due to transaction costs) may create a band of inaction allowing for deviations from parity in purchasing prices. In the case of the UIP puzzle, limits to arbitrage in the forex market (mainly due to risk) may allow for deviations from interest parity in some situations.

# 3 Debt and Default

In the chapter on the gains from financial globalization, when global capital markets work well, they can deliver gains in the form of consumption smoothing and investment efficiency. Yet international financial relations are often disrupted by sovereign default, which occurs when a sovereign government (i.e., one that is autonomous or independent) fails to meet its legal obligations to make payments on debt held by foreigners.

Sovereign default has a long history. Perhaps the first recorded default was in the fourth century BC, when Greek municipalities defaulted on loans from the Delos Temple.[14] Many of today's advanced countries have defaulted in the past. In 1343 a warweary Edward III of England defaulted on short-term loans which ruined the major merchant banks of Florence, Italy. In 1557, Phillip II of Spain defaulted on short-term loans principally from South German bankers.[15] Spain defaulted six more times before 1800 and another seven times in the nineteenth century. France defaulted eight times between 1558 and the Revolution in 1789. A group of German states, Portugal,

Austria, and Greece defaulted at least four times each in the 1800s, and across Europe as a whole, there were at least 46 sovereign defaults between 1501 and 1900.[16] The United States has maintained a clean sheet during its brief existence, although several U.S. states defaulted when they were emerging markets in the 1800s.[17]

The advanced countries of today tend not to default, although the large debts they have incurred during the Global Financial Crisis may put some of them at greater risk (from 2010 to 2013 countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Slovenia, and Cyprus have been under strain, and Greece actually defaulted). In contrast, default has been, and remains, a recurring problem in emerging markets and developing countries. One count shows that countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Venezuela have defaulted between five and nine times since 1824 (and at least once since 1980) and have spent  $30\%$  of the time failing to meet their financial obligations. Another count lists 48 sovereign defaults in the period from 1976 to 1989, many in Latin America but others dotted throughout the world, and 16 more in the period from 1998 to 2002, including headline crises in Russia (1998) and Argentina (2002).

One of the most puzzling aspects of the default problem is that emerging markets and developing countries often get into default trouble at much lower levels of debt than advanced countries. Yet default is a serious macroeconomic and financial problem for these countries. Because they attract so few financial flows of other kinds, government debt constitutes a large share (more than  $30\%$ ) of these nations' external liabilities.[19]

To understand the workings of sovereign debt and defaults, we must first look at some of the peculiar characteristics of this form of borrowing.

# A Few Peculiar Facts About Sovereign Debt

The first important fact about sovereign debt is that debtors are almost never forced to pay. Using the military to enforce repayment is always costly, and is certainly out of fashion in the modern world. Legal actions are also largely futile: when developing country debt is issued in a foreign jurisdiction (e.g., in London or New York), there is practically no legal way to enforce a claim against a sovereign nation, and the recent increase in sovereign default litigation has done very little to change this state of affairs.[20]

 For example, see Section 258 of the Mississippi state constitution. The American colonies did default, for example, on the paper bills known as *continentals*, issued from 1775 to 1779 to finance the Revolutionary War. However, in an attempt to make good, the colonies' bad debts were assumed by the United States in 1790 on the urging of the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, a statesman with an acute understanding of the importance of good credit.

Lane, 2006, "The External Wealth of Nations Mark II: Revised and Extended Estimates of Foreign Assets and Liabilities, 1970-2004," IMF Working Paper No. 06/69.

20 On litigation, see Federico Sturzenegger and Jeromin Zettelmeyer, "Has the Legal Threat to Sovereign Debt Restructuring Become Real?" CIF Working Paper, Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, April 2006. In theory, foreign assets of defaulters can be legally seized, but defaulting nations naturally avoid this by repatriating such assets shortly before going into default. In contrast, advanced country debt is usually issued at home, in the country's own jurisdiction, where creditors (domestic and foreign) have stronger legal claims against the sovereign. Even so, the winds could change, and the still ongoing battle in the New York courts in the case of NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina exposes the stubborn, but as yet fruitless, efforts of creditors in their eternal efforts to pare back sovereign immunity and enforce their contracts.

The repayment of a sovereign debt is thus a matter of choice for the borrowing government. Economists are therefore inclined to look for a rational explanation in which default is triggered by economic conditions: how painful does repayment have to become before default occurs?

To answer this question, we must evaluate the costs and benefits of default. The benefits are clear: no repayment means the country gets to keep all that money. Are there costs? While not as apparent as the benefits, there must be costs to default—if there were no costs, countries would never pay their debts, and, as a result, no lending would happen in the first place! Thus economists (ignoring sentimental motives for repayment such as honor and honesty) have focused on two types of costs that act as a "punishment" for defaulters and provide the incentive for nations to repay their debts.[21]

Financial market penalties. Empirical evidence shows that debtors are usually excluded from credit markets for some time after a default. This exclusion could expose them to greater consumption risk and other disadvantages. However, economic theory casts doubt on whether avoiding these costs is enough of an incentive to repay the loans. Repayment is less likely when the exclusion period is short or when borrowers have other ways to smooth consumption (such as investing previously borrowed wealth, purchasing insurance, or going to a different set of financial intermediaries).

- Broader macroeconomic costs. These could include lost investment, lost trade, or lost output arising from adverse financial conditions in the wake of a default. These adverse conditions include higher risk premiums, credit contractions, exchange rate crises, and banking crises. If these costs are high enough, they can encourage nations to repay, even if financial market costs are insufficient.

Summary Sovereign debt is a contingent claim on a nation's assets: governments will repay depending on whether it is more beneficial to repay than to default. With a simple model of how a country makes the decision to default, we can better understand why borrowers default some of the time and repay some of the time; what ultimately causes these contingent outcomes; why some borrowers get into default trouble even at low levels of debt, while others do not; and how lenders respond to this state of affairs and why they continue to lend to defaulting countries. The model we develop is simple, but it provides useful insights on all of these questions.[22]

# A Model of Default, Part One: The Probability of Default

In this section, we present a static, one-period model of sovereign debt and default. The first part of the model focuses on default as a contingent claim that will be paid only under certain conditions.

Old-style punishment: In response to a default, the French invaded and occupied Mexico in 1862, suffering only one major defeat at the battle of Puebla (now commemorated by the Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo).

Assumptions The model focuses on the desire of borrowers to default in hard times, when output is relatively low, so that they may smooth their consumption. Thus, for now we ignore any investment motives for borrowing and concentrate on the consumption-smoothing or "insurance" benefits that a country derives from having the option to default on its debt and consume more than it otherwise would.

If repayment is to be contingent in our model, on what will it be contingent? To introduce some exogenous fluctuations, we assume, realistically, that a borrowing country has a fluctuating level of output  $Y$ . Specifically,  $Y$  is equally likely to take any value between a minimum  $\overline{Y} - V$  and a maximum  $\overline{Y}$ . The difference between the minimum and maximum is a measure of the volatility of output,  $V$ . Although the level of output  $Y$  is not known in advance, we assume that everyone understands the level of  $V$  and the probability of different output levels  $Y$ . We suppose the government is the sole borrower and it takes out a one-period loan in the previous period, before the level of output is known. The debt will be denoted  $L$  for loan (or liability, which it is) and carries an interest rate  $r_{L}$ , which we call the lending rate. We suppose this loan is supplied by one or more competitive foreign creditors who have access to funds from the world capital market at a risk-free interest rate  $r$ , which we assume is a constant.

We suppose the loan is due to be paid off after the country finds out what output  $Y$  is in the current period. The problem we have is as follows: to figure out the lending terms (the debt level and lending rate) and to understand what the country chooses to do when the loan comes due (default versus repayment). As in many problems in economics, we must "solve backward" to allow for expectations.

The Borrower Chooses Default Versus Repayment We assume the sovereign borrower faces some "punishment" or cost for defaulting. There are debates about what forms these costs could take, and we discuss this later in this section. For now we do not take a stand on exactly what these costs are but assume that if the government defaults, then it faces a cost equivalent to a fraction  $c$  of its output: that is,  $cY$  is lost, leaving only  $(1 - c)Y$  for national consumption. Note that these costs are unlike debt payments: they are just losses for the debtor with no corresponding gains for the creditors.

Now that we have established some costs of defaulting, the choice facing the country becomes clearer. For simplicity, we assume two possible courses of action: repay or default.[23] If the government repays the debt, the country will be able to consume only output  $Y$  minus the principal and interest on the loan  $(1 + r_L)L$ . If the government defaults, the country can consume output  $Y$  minus the punishment  $cY$ . Thus, the government will act as follows:

$$

Figure 22-8 plots both sides of this inequality against  $Y$  for the case in which both repayment and default will occur within the range of possible output levels between maximum output  $\overline{Y}$  and minimum output  $\overline{Y} - V$ . At some critical level of output, called the repayment threshold, the government will switch from repayment to default. At this critical level, the two sides of the preceding inequality have to be equal; that is, the debt payoff amount  $(1 + r_L)L$  must equal the punishment cost  $cY$ .

By rearranging the preceding inequality, we can find the level of  $Y$  at the repayment threshold  $Y_{T}$  and can restate the government's choice as

$$
\text {R e p a y i f} \quad Y \geq \underbrace {(1 + r _ {L}) L} _ {c}
$$

Repayment threshold

$$
\overline {{\bar {Y}}} _ {T}
$$

For the case shown in Figure 22-8, we assume that this repayment threshold,  $Y_{T} = (1 + r_{L})L / c$ , is within the range of possible outputs between the minimum  $\overline{Y} - V$  and the maximum  $\overline{Y}$ .

The value of consumption after repayment,  Y - (1 + r_{L})L , is shown by the repayment line RR, which has a slope of 1: every extra 1 of output goes toward consumption, net of debt repayments. The value of consumption after nonrepayment and default, Y - cY, is shown by the nonrepayment line NN, which has a slope of (1 - c) which is less than 1: when a country has decided to default, from every extra 1 of output gained by not repaying the country's debts, only  (1 - c) goes toward consumption, allowing for the net punishment cost.

The lines RR and NN intersect at the critical point  $T$ , and the corresponding level of output  $Y_{T}$  is the repayment threshold. Given that the slope of NN is less than the

Repayment Versus Default When output is high, the country repays its debt with probability  $p$  (the fraction of the shaded area that is light) because the cost of defaulting is greater than the cost of repayment. In this region, consumption after repayment (shown by line RR) is greater than consumption after defaulting (line NN). When output is low, the country defaults with probability  $1 - p$  (the fraction of the shaded area that is dark). In this region, the cost of defaulting is less than the cost of repayment because line NN is above line RR. The switch from default to repayment occurs at point T, where the critical level of output reaches the repayment threshold  $Y_{T}$ .

slope of RR, we can see that the country will choose to repay when output is above the repayment threshold  $Y_{T}$  (i.e., to the right of T) and to default when output is below the repayment threshold  $Y_{T}$  (i.e., to the left of T).

Note that the size of the repayment region relative to the default region tells us how likely repayment is to occur relative to default. Let the probability of repayment be  $p$ . The key piece of the puzzle is to figure out what determines  $p$ . We now show how it depends on two factors: how volatile output is and how burdensome the debt repayment is.

An Increase in the Debt Burden The first variation on the model in Figure 22-8 that we consider is an exogenous increase in the level of debt payments, which we suppose increase from the original level  $(1 + r_{L})L$  to a new higher level  $(1 + r_{L}^{\prime})L^{\prime}$ . This increase could be due to a change in the debt level, a change in the lending rate, or some combination of the two. This case is shown in Figure 22-9.

The value of consumption after repayment,  $Y - (1 + r_{L})L$ , must fall as  $(1 + r_{L})L$  rises, so line RR will shift down to  $\mathrm{R}'\mathrm{R}'$ . The costs of repayment are higher, and the country will find it beneficial to default more often. We can see this in the figure because after the RR curve shifts down, a greater part of the line NN will now sit above the line  $\mathrm{R}'\mathrm{R}'$ , and the new critical intersection point  $\mathrm{T}$  will move to the right at  $\mathrm{T}'$ , corresponding to the new higher repayment threshold,  $Y_{T}' = (1 + r_{L}')L' / c$ .

What does this mean for the probability of repayment? It must fall. The repayment region on the right is now smaller, and the default region on the left is larger. With all

An Increase in the Debt Burden An increase in the level of debt or the lending rate raises the repayment sum and so reduces consumption after repayment at all levels of  $Y$ , causing RR to shift down. This shift makes repayment less likely (the light shaded area gets smaller) and default more likely (the dark shaded area gets larger). The probability of repayment  $p$  falls. The switch from default to repayment occurs at a higher critical level of output at  $T'$ , the new repayment threshold  $Y_T'$ .

output levels in the two regions equally likely, the probability  $p$  that output is in the repayment region must now be lower.

We have considered only a small change in the debt burden, so the repayment region hasn't vanished. But if the debt burden increases sufficiently, RR will shift down so far that the critical point  $T$  will shift all the way to the right, to the maximum level of output, the repayment region will disappear, and the probability of repayment will be zero (or  $0\%$ ). If the debt burden is high enough, the country is always better off taking the punishment.

Conversely, if the debt burden decreases sufficiently, RR will shift up so far that the critical point  $T$  will shift all the way to the left, to the minimum level of output, the default region will disappear, and the probability of repayment will be 1 (or  $100\%$ ). If the debt burden is low enough, the country will always repay.

Thus, the outcome shown in Figure 22-8 applies only when the debt burden is at some intermediate level such that the repayment threshold is between the minimum and maximum levels of output.

An Increase in Volatility of Output The second variation on the model in Figure 22-8 that we consider is an increase in the volatility of output, which we suppose increases from its original level  $V$  to a new higher level  $V'$ . This case is shown in Figure 22-10. There could be many reasons why a country is subject to higher output volatility: weather shocks to agricultural output, political instability, fluctuations in the prices of its exports, and so on.

FIGURE 22-10

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/87ac7c88-4759-4566-9a91-062430ca92dd/c62228088306cafd8276fafce207dcdc630f6b9d7694cd2f89ca6386d6b22eea.jpg)

An Increase in Volatility An increase in volatility expands the range of low output possibilities. The repayment threshold  $Y_{T}$  stays the same because it is unrelated to  $V$  and depends only on the cost of defaulting and the size of the repayment burden. Even though the repayment region (light shaded area) remains the same size, the increased volatility makes default more likely because the default region (dark shaded area) is now relatively larger. The probability of repayment  $p$  falls.

In this case, the consumption levels after repayment on line RR and after default on line NN are unchanged because the debt burden is unchanged. What has changed is that there is now a much wider range of possible output levels. Higher volatility  $V$  means that output can now fall to an even lower minimum level,  $\overline{Y} - V'$ , but can only attain the same maximum  $\overline{Y}$ .

Thus, an increase in  $V$  makes default more likely. In Figure 22-8, the country wanted to default whenever output fell below the critical level  $T$ , so it will certainly want to default in the wider range of low outputs brought into play by higher volatility. The default region gets larger and now includes all these new possible levels of output to the left of  $T$ . Conversely, the range of outputs to the right of  $T$  where repayment occurs is unchanged because the repayment threshold,  $Y_{T} = (1 + r_{L})L / c$ , is unaffected by a change in  $V$ . Hence, the probability  $p$  that output is in the repayment region must fall because the repayment region is now smaller relative to the default region.

To sum up, a rise in volatility lowers the level of debt  $L$  at which default becomes a possibility and after that point makes default more likely at any given level of  $L$ , up to the point at which default occurs with probability  $100\%$ .

The Lender Chooses the Lending Rate All of the preceding results assume a given interest rate on the loan. But now that we know how the likely probability of repayment  $p$  is determined, we can calculate the interest rate that a competitive lender must charge. Competition will mean that lenders can only just break even and make zero expected profit. Thus, the lender will set its lending rate so that the expected revenues from each dollar lent, given by the probability of repayment  $p$  times the amount repaid  $(1 + r_L)$ , equal the lender's cost for each dollar lent, which is given by  $(1 + r)$ , the principal plus the risk-free interest rate at which the lender can obtain funds.

$$
\text {B r e a k - e v e n c o n d i t i o n f o r l e n d e r :} \underbrace {p} _ {\substack {\text {P r o b a b i l i t y} \quad \text {L e n d e r s r e v e n u e} \\ \text {o f r e p a y m e n t} \quad \text {i f r e p a i d}}} \underbrace {(1 + r _ {L})} _ {\substack {\text {L e n d e r s c o s t s} \quad \text {L e n d e r s c o s t s}}} = \underbrace {(1 + r)} _ {\substack {\text {L e n d e r s c o s t s}}}
$$

What do we learn from this expression? The right-hand side is a constant, determined by the world risk-free rate of interest  $r$ . Thus, the left-hand side must be constant, too. If  $p$  were 1 (100\% probability of repayment), the solution would be straightforward: with no risk of default and competitive lenders, the borrower will rightly obtain a lending rate equal to the risk-free rate  $r$ . But as the probability of repayment  $p$  falls, to keep the left-hand side constant, the lenders must raise the lending rate  $r_L$ . That is, to compensate for the default risk, the lenders charge a risk premium so that they still just break even.

# Is There Profit in Lending to Developing Countries?

Our break-even assumption may seem a little odd. A popular belief is that rich country creditors, like loan sharks, are making huge profits from lending to developing countries. But the long-run empirical evidence suggests otherwise.

Economists Christoph Klingen, Beatrice Weder, and Jeromin Zettelmeyer looked at how lenders fared in emerging markets from the 1970s to the 2000s by computing the returns on government debt in 22 borrower countries.[24] They did not look at the ex ante returns that consisted of the promised repayments in the original loan contracts. Instead, they looked at the ex post returns, the realized rates of interest actually paid on the loans, allowing for any defaults, suspensions of payments, reschedulings, or other deviations from the contractual terms.

The results were striking, as shown by Figure 22-11. The average returns on emerging market bonds in this period were  $9.1\%$  per year. This was barely above the three-year U.S. government bond returns of  $8.6\%$  over the same period and below returns on 10-year U.S. government bonds  $(9.2\%)$  and U.S. corporate bonds  $(10.5\%)$ . This is not because the borrowers were charged low interest rates beforehand. They were charged typical risk premiums. But if the loans had been paid off according to those terms, we would have expected that lenders would have reaped much larger returns ex post. For example, based on the typical risk premiums seen in emerging markets in the period 1998 to 2007, an extra  $2.8\%$  return would have been demanded as a risk premium ex ante, pushing ex post returns up to around  $12\%$  to  $13\%$ . But such high ex post returns were not seen, as Figure 22-11 shows: defaults ate up the risk premiums and the lenders barely broke even.

Considering the highly risky nature of emerging market debt, as compared with U.S. corporate debt, this finding is remarkable and it suggests that the break-even assumption of our simple model is not far wrong. Admittedly, there were periods when emerging market bonds paid off handsomely. In the early 1990s there were few defaults and lenders were repaid at high interest rates. But there were also periods with massive defaults, like the early 1980s, in which repeated postponements and restructurings meant that creditors got back only pennies on each dollar they had lent to the defaulting countries. Defaults are rare but cataclysmic

Actual ex post annual returns on debt, 1970-2000 (\% per year)

Returns on Emerging Market Debt, 1970s-2000s The ex post annual realized returns on emerging market debt have been  $9.1\%$  on average, as high as  $9.5\%$  in Latin America and Asia, but as low as  $7\%$  elsewhere (columns 1-4). Given their riskiness, these returns compare unfavorably with returns on safe U.S. government debt and U.S. corporate debt (columns 5-7). Whatever ex ante risk premiums were charged to emerging markets, defaults ate them all up and lenders only just broke even.

events for creditors, so only a long-run sample can be informative. But judging from the data in Figure 22-11, lenders to emerging markets have only just broken even, if that.

# A Model of Default, Part Two: Loan Supply and Demand

The first steps we took in constructing the model were to understand the problem from the lender's standpoint. Knowing the probability  $p$  that borrowers will default when output is low, lenders adjust the lending rate  $r_{L}$  they charge depending on the volatility of output  $V$  and the level of debt  $L$ . Knowing the lending rate and the debt amount determines the loan supply curve for a country, which, combined with an understanding of loan demand, will allow us to determine equilibrium in the loan market.

Loan Supply Suppose output volatility is at some low level  $V$ . The probability of repayment is shown in Figure 22-12, panel (a). The loan supply curve  $LS(V)$  is shown in panel (b).

At low levels of debt, as we saw, the probability of repayment is  $100\%$ , so a loan of size  $L$  in this range will be made at a lending rate  $r_L$  that equals the risk-free rate. In this debt range, the loan supply curve is flat between points 1 and 2. Then, as debt rises above some loan size  $L_V$  that depends on the volatility of the borrowing country's output, the probability of repayment starts to fall below 1 ( $100\%$ ), and the break-even condition tells us that lenders will have to start increasing the lending rate so they don't lose their shirts. At point 2 (the point at which the probability of repayment falls below  $100\%$ ), the supply curve starts to slope up. For any given increase in loan size  $L$ , lenders must decide how much to increase the lending rate  $r_L$  to ensure that the break-even condition is met. In making this decision, the lenders must take into account that any increases in  $L$  and/or  $r_L$  will adversely affect the repayment probability  $p$  (as we saw earlier). Finally, as the loan size approaches its maximum  $L_{MAX}$ , the rising repayment burden (higher  $L$  and higher  $r_L$ ) will cause the probability of repayment to approach zero. The lending rate will have to approach infinity to ensure that the loan will break even, so the loan supply curve becomes vertical as the debt limit  $L_{MAX}$  is reached. No loans are supplied above this level of debt.

Loan Demand The equilibrium market outcome must be somewhere on the lender's loan supply curve. But it must also be on the borrower's loan demand curve. How is that determined? The formal derivation of borrowing demand depends on the country's consumption preferences, including its aversion to risk; this is mathematically complex, but we can sum up the results intuitively by drawing a loan demand curve  $LD(V)$  that depends on two factors: the lending rate charged,  $r_{L}$ , and the volatility of output,  $V$ . We restrict our attention to the normal case in which the demand curve slopes down so that an increase in the interest cost of the loan (a rise in  $r_{L}$ ) causes a decrease in the size of loan demanded (a fall in  $L$ ).

We can now finish our graphical representation of the loan market equilibrium, and in Figure 22-12, panel (b), equilibrium is at point 3, where loan supply  $LS$  and loan demand  $LD$  intersect. Note that this intersection will be, as shown, between  $L_{V}$  and  $L_{MAX}$ . Why? Below debt level  $L_{V}$ , the country never defaults and so debt provides no consumption-smoothing insurance in this range, and the country will want to borrow more and move up and to the right along the loan supply curve. As the cost

FIGURE 22-12

Loan Market Equilibrium When Volatility Is Low A higher level of debt means the probability of repayment falls (and the probability of default increases) between points 1 and 2 in panel (a), starting at the debt level  $L_{V}$ . As the probability of repayment falls, lenders increase the lending rate as the quantity of debt increases, so the loan supply curve LS slopes up in panel (b). As the lending rate falls, more debt is demanded by the country as insurance against consumption risk, so the loan demand curve LD slopes down. The equilibrium is at point 3 where demand and supply intersect.

of borrowing rises, however, the country must consider the trade-off between the amount of insurance it obtains from the debt and the rising cost of that insurance. At some point, this trade-off evens out and we reach the loan quantity the country desires. In Figure 22-12 the quantity of loans supplied and demanded will be equal at equilibrium point 3 with debt level  $L$  and lending rate  $r_{L}$ .
