2.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter we will look at one of the most important economic indicators for policy-makers in an

- pen economy, namely the balance of payments. What is happening to a country's balance of payments

-,en captures the news headlines and can become the focus of attention. A good or bad set of !gures
can have an influential e$etc on the exchange rate and can lead policy-makers to change the content of
their economic policies. De!cits may lead to the government raising interest rates or reducing public
expenditure in order to reduce expenditure on imports. Indeed, for a country with a !xed exchange rate
and persistent de!cits there could be a speculative attack on the country forcing it to devalue its currency.
Alternatively, de!cits may lead to calls for protection against foreign imports or capital controls to defend
the exchange rate.

Before considering various policy options that may be devised to deal with perceived problems in the

balance of payments, we need to consider in some detail exactly what the balance of payments !gures are

and what is meant by the notion of a balance of payments surplus or de!cit. In this chapter, we shall look

at what is contained in the balance of payments statistics, how they are compiled and various possible

economic interpretations of the statistics. We will also look at how the current account of the balance

- f payments can be interpreted within the framework of the national income accounts and the e$ects of
changes in governments' expenditure and exports on the national income and balance of payments in an

- pen economy.

2.2 WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?

Te balance of payments is a statistical record of all the economic transactions between residents of the

reporting country and residents of the rest of the world during a given time period. Te usual reporting

period for all the statistics included in the accounts is a year. However, some of the statistics that make up

the balance of payments are published on a more regular monthly and quarterly basis. Without question

the balance of payments is one of the most important statistical statements for any country. It reveals how

many goods and services the country has been exporting and importing and whether the country has been

borrowing from or lending money to the rest of the world. In addition, whether or not the central monetary

authority (usually the central bank) has added to or reduced its reserves of foreign currency is reported in

the statistics.

A key de!nition that needs to be resolved at the outset is that of a domestic and foreign resident. It is

important to note that citizenship and residency are not necessarily the same thing from the viewpoint

- f the balance of payments statistics. Te term 'residents' comprises individuals, households, !rms and
the public authorities. Tere are some problems that arise with respect to the de!nition of a resident, for
example multinational corporations are by de!nition resident in more than one country. For the purposes

- f balance of payments reporting, the subsidiaries of a multinational are treated as being a resident in the
country in which they are located, even if their shares are not actually owned by domestic residents. Another
problem concerns the treatment of international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the World Bank, the United Nations, the European Commission and so forth. Tese institutions are
treated as being foreign residents even though they may actually be located in the reporting country. For
example, although the IMF is located in Washington, contributions by the US government to the Fund are
included in the US balance of payments statistics because they are regarded as transactions with a foreign
resident. Tourists are regarded as being foreign residents if they stay in the reporting country for less than

a year.

Te criterion for a transaction to be included in the balance of payments is that it must involve a transaction

between a resident of the reporting country and a resident of the rest of the world. Purchases and sales between

residents of the same country are excluded.

2.3 COLLECTION, REPORTING AND PRESENTATION OF THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

STATISTICS

Te balance of payments statistics record all of the transactions between domestic and foreign residents, be

they purchases or sales of goods, services or !nancial assets such as bonds, equities and banking transactions.

Reported !gures are normally in the domestic currency of the reporting country. Obviously, collecting

statistics on every transaction between domestic and foreign residents is an impossible task. Te authorities

collect their information from the customs authorities, surveys of tourist numbers and expenditures, and data

- n capital inflows and outflows which are obtained from banks, pension funds, multinationals and investment
houses. Information on government expenditures and receipts with foreign residents is obtained from local
authorities and central government agencies. Te statistics are based on reliable sampling techniques but,
nevertheless, given the variety of sources, the !gures provide only an estimate of the actual transactions. Te
responses from the various sources are compiled by government statistical agencies. In the United States, the
statistics are compiled by the US Department of Commerce and in the United Kingdom by the Office for
National Statistics.

38

The Balance of Payments

Tere is no unique method governing the presentation of balance of payments statistics and there can be

considerable variations in the presentations of di$erent national authorities. However, the IMF provides a

set of guidelines for the compilation of balance of payments statistics published in its _Balance of Payments_

_Manual_ . In addition, the Fund publishes the balance of payments statistics of all its member countries in

a standardized format facilitating intercountry comparisons. Tese are presented in two publications – the

_Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook_ and _International Financial Statistics_ .

In the USA, the value of exports and imports is compiled on a monthly basis and likewise in the UK. Te

monthly !gures are subject to later revision and two sets of statistics are published: the seasonally adjusted

!gure and the unadjusted !gure. Te seasonally adjusted !gures correct the balance of payments !gures for

the e$etc of seasonal factors to reveal underlying trends.

2.4 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTS

An important point about a country's balance of payments statistics is that in an accounting sense it always

balances. Tis is because it is based upon the principle of double-entry bookkeeping. Each transaction between

a domestic and foreign resident has two sides to it, a receipt and a payment, and both of these are recorded in

the balance of payments statistics. Each receipt of currency from residents of the rest of the world is recorded

as a credit item (a plus in the accounts), while each payment to residents of the rest of the world is recorded

as a debit (a minus in the accounts).

Before considering some examples of how di$erent types of economic transactions between domestic and

foreign residents get recorded in the balance of payments, we need to consider the various sub-accounts that

make up the balance of payments. Te statistics are divided into three main sections: the current account, the

capital and !nancial account, and the settlements account. Te reason for dividing the balance of payments

into these three main parts is that the current account items refer to income flows, the capital and !nancial

account records changes in the assets and liabilities of the private sector and non-central-bank public sector,

and the settlements account records any changes in assets and liabilities of the central bank. A simpli!ed

example of the annual balance of payments accounts for Americana is presented in Table 2.1.

2.5 AN OVERVIEW OF THE SUB-ACCOUNTS IN THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

_The trade balance_

Te trade balance is sometimes referred to as the visible balance because it represents the di$erence between

receipts for exports of goods and expenditure on imports of goods which can be visibly seen crossing frontiers.

Te receipts for exports are recorded as a credit in the balance of payments, while the payment for imports is

recorded as a debit. When the trade balance is in surplus this means that the country has earned more from

its exports of goods than it has paid for its imports of goods.

_The current account balance_

Te current account balance is the sum of the visible trade balance and the invisible balance. Te invisible

balance shows the di$erence between revenue received for exports of services and payments made for imports

- f services such as shipping, tourism, insurance and banking. In addition, receipts and payments of interest,
dividends and pro!ts are recorded in the invisible balance because they represent the rewards for investment
in overseas companies, bonds and equity, while payments reflect the rewards to foreign residents for their
investment in the domestic economy. As such, they are receipts and payments for the services of capital that
earn and cost the country income, just as do exports and imports.

The reader will note that there is an item referred to as 'unilateral transfers' included in the invisible

balance; these are payments or receipts for which there is no corresponding quid pro quo. Examples

- f such transactions are migrant workers' remittances to their families back home, the payment of
pensions to foreign residents, and foreign aid. Such receipts and payments represent a redistribution

- f income between domestic and foreign residents. Unilateral payments can be viewed as a fall in

40

The Balance of Payments

domestic income due to payments to foreigners and so are recorded as a debit, while unilateral receipts

can be viewed as an increase in income due to receipts from foreigners and consequently are recorded

as a credit.

_The capital and financial account_

Te capital and !nancial account records transactions concerning the movement of capital into and out

- f the country. Capital comes into the country by borrowing, sales of overseas assets and investment in
the country by foreigners. Tese items are referred to as 'capital inflows' and are recorded as credit items
in the balance of payments. _Capital inflows are, in effect, a decrease in the country's holding of foreign_
_assets or an increase in liabilities to foreigners._ Capital inflows are recorded as pluses, and the easiest way
to understand why they are pluses is to think of foreign borrowing as the export of an IOU. Similarly,
investment by foreign residents in the domestic economy can be thought of as the export of equity or
bonds, while sales of overseas investments to foreigners is an export of those investments to foreigners.
Conversely, capital leaves the country due to lending, buying of overseas assets and purchases of domestic
assets owned by foreign residents. Tese items represent capital outflows and are recorded as debits in
the capital account. _Capital outflows are, in effect, an increase in the country's holding of foreign assets or_
_a decrease in liabilities to foreigners._ Tese items are recorded as debits as they represent the purchase of
an IOU from foreigners, the purchase of foreign bonds or equity and the purchase of investments in the
foreign economy.

Items in the capital and !nancial account are normally distinguished according to whether they

- riginate from the private or public sector and whether they are of a short-term or long-term nature. Te
summation of the capital inflows and outflows as recorded in the !nancial account gives the !nancial
account balance.

_Settlements balance_

Te settlements balance shows transactions (if any occur) undertaken by the central bank. Tere are two key

items that are recorded in the settlements account: (i) rises and falls in foreign exchange reserves; (ii)%borrowing

funds or repayments of loans to international organizations such as the IMF.

A central bank normally holds a stock of reserves made up of foreign currency assets, principally US

Treasury bonds (the US authorities hold mainly euro and yen Treasury bonds). Such reserves are held

primarily to enable the central bank to purchase its currency should it wish to prevent it depreciating.

If a central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to purchase its currency then its foreign

exchange reserves fall and this is recorded as a plus in the settlements account. Conversely, if a central

bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to sell its currency then its foreign exchange reserves rise

and this is recorded as a minus in the settlements account. Te fact that reserve increases are recorded as a

minus, while reserve falls are recorded as a plus in the balance of payments statistics, is usually a source of

confusion. It is most easily rationalized by thinking that reserves increase when the authorities have been

purchasing the foreign currency because the domestic currency is strong. Tis implies that the other items

in the balance of payments are in surplus, so reserve increases have to be recorded as a debit to ensure

- verall balance. Conversely, reserves fall when the authorities have been supporting a currency that is
weak, that is, all other items sum to a de!cit so reserve falls must be recorded as a plus to ensure overall
balance.

41

International Finance

If a country has to borrow funds from the IMF then this is an increase in its liabilities and is recorded

as a plus in the settlements account. Conversely, when a country pays back the loan to the IMF then this is

a reduction in its liabilities and is recorded as a minus in its settlements account. Borrowing from the IMF

usually comes with strict conditions attached and repayments on the loans are usually expected to occur

within three to !ve years from the loans being made.

_The statistical error_

Given the huge statistical problems involved in compiling the balance of payments statistics, there will usually

be a discrepancy between the sum of all the items recorded in the current account, !nancial account and the

settlements balance – which in theory should sum to zero. To ensure that the credits and debits are equal

it is necessary to incorporate a **statistical error** for any di$erence between the sum of credits and debits

in the three accounts. Tere are several possible sources of this error. One of the most important is that it

is an impossible task to keep track of all the transactions between domestic and foreign residents; many of

the reported statistics are based on sampling estimates derived from separate sources, so that some error is

unavoidable. Another problem is that the desire to avoid taxes means that some of the transactions in the

capital and !nancial account are underreported. Moreover, some dishonest !rms may deliberately underinvoice their exports and over-invoice their imports so as to deflate arti!cially their pro!ts. Another problem

is one of 'leads and lags'. Te balance of payments records receipts and payments for a transaction between

domestic and foreign residents, but it can happen that a good is imported but the payment delayed. Since the

import is recorded by the customs authorities and the payment by the banks, the time discrepancy may mean

that the two sides of the transaction are not recorded in the same set of%!gures.

2.6 RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONS IN THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

To understand exactly why the sum of credits and debits in the balance of payments should sum to zero we

will consider some examples of economic transactions between domestic and foreign residents. Tere are

basically !ve types of economic transactions that can take place between domestic and foreign residents:

1. An exchange of goods/services in return for a !nancial asset.
2. An exchange of goods/services in return for other goods/services. Such trade is known as barter or

countertrade.

3. An exchange of a !nancial item in return for a !nancial item.
4. A transfer of goods or services with no corresponding quid pro quo (for example, military and food aid).
5. A transfer of !nancial assets with no corresponding quid pro quo (for example, migrant workers'

remittances to their families abroad or a money gi,).

We will now look at how each transaction is recorded twice, once as a credit and once as a debit. Table 2.2

considers various types of transactions between US and UK residents and shows how each transaction is

recorded in each of the two countries' balance of payments. Te exchange rate for all transactions is assumed

to be \$1.35/£1.

Te examples in Table 2.2 illustrate in a simpli!ed manner the double-entry nature of balance of payments

statistics. Since each credit in the accounts has a corresponding debit elsewhere, the sum of all items should be

equal to zero. Tis naturally raises the question as to what is meant by a balance of payments de!cit or surplus.

2.7 WHAT IS MEANT BY A BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SURPLUS OR DEFICIT?

As we have seen in Table 2.2, the balance of payments always balances since each credit in the account has

a corresponding debit elsewhere. However, while the overall balance of payments always balances, this does

not mean that each of the individual accounts that make up the balance of payments is necessarily in balance.

For instance, the current account can be in surplus while the capital account is in de!cit. When talking about

43

International Finance

a balance of payments de!cit or surplus, economists are really saying that a subset of items in the balance of

payments are in surplus or de!cit.

_The trade account and current account_

Tese two accounts derive much of their importance because estimates are published on a monthly basis by

most developed countries. Since the current account balance is concerned with both visible and invisibles

it is generally considered to be the more important of the two accounts. What really makes a current

account surplus or de!cit important is that a surplus means that the country as a whole is earning more

than it is spending and, as such, is increasing its stock of claims on the rest of the world or is reducing its

indebtedness; while a de!cit means that the country as a whole is spending more than it is earning and is

therefore reducing its net claims on the rest of the world or is increasing its indebtedness. Furthermore,

as we shall see in Chapter 3, the current account can readily be incorporated into economic analysis of an

- pen economy. More generally, the current account is likely to quickly pick up changes in other economic
variables, such as changes in the real exchange rate, domestic and foreign economic growth, and relative
price inflation.

_The basic balance_

Tis is the current account balance plus the net balance on long-term capital flows. Te basic balance was

considered to be particularly important during the 1950s and 1960s period of !xed exchange rates because

it was viewed as bringing together the stable elements in the balance of payments. It was argued that any

signi!cant change in the basic balance must be a sign of a fundamental change in the direction of the balance

- f payments. Te more volatile elements such as short-term capital flows and changes in official reserves were
regarded as below-the-line items.

Although a worsening of the basic balance is supposed to be a sign of a worsening economic situation,

having an overall basic balance de!cit is not necessarily a bad thing. For example, a country may have a current

account de!cit that is reinforced by a large long-term capital outflow so that the basic balance is in a large

de!cit. However, the capital outflow will yield future pro!ts, dividends and interest receipts that will help to

generate future surpluses on the current account. Conversely, a surplus in the basic balance is not necessarily a

good thing. A current account de!cit which is more than covered by a net long-term capital inflow so that the

basic balance is in surplus could be open to two interpretations. It might be argued that because the country

is able to borrow over the long run there is nothing to worry about, since the country is regarded as viable by

those foreigners who are prepared to lend money over the long run to the country. Another interpretation

could argue that the basic balance surplus is a problem because the long-term borrowing will lead to future

interest, pro!ts and dividend payments which will worsen the current account de!cit.

Apart from interpretation, the principal problem with the basic balance concerns the classi!cation of

shortand long-term capital flows. Te usual means of classifying long-term loans or borrowing is that they

be of at least 12 months to maturity. However, many long-term capital flows can be easily converted into

short-term flows if need be. For example, the purchase of a !ve-year US Treasury bond by a UK investor

would be classi!ed as a long-term capital outflow in the UK balance of payments and as a long-term capital

inflow in the US balance of payments. However, the UK investor could very easily sell the bond back to US

investors any time before its maturity date. Similarly, many short-term items with less than 12 months to

maturity automatically get renewed so that they e$ectively become long-term assets. Another problem that

blurs the distinction between short-term and long-term capital flows is that transactions in !nancial assets are

44

The Balance of Payments

classi!ed in accordance with their original maturity date. Hence, if a,er four and a half years a UK investor

sells his or her !ve-year US Treasury bond to a US citizen it will be classi!ed as a long-term capital flow even

though the bond has only six months to maturity.

Despite its flaws, the basic balance concept could still have some relevance today if one counts net foreign

direct investment (FDI) as the long-term capital account balance. A country that has a current account de!cit

but is a net recipient of FDI could be interpreted as a sign of con!dence in the long-term prospects of the

economy: the FDI will increase the country's capital stock and future export earnings. On the other hand,

a country with a current account de!cit and net FDI outflows could be interpreted as a sign of a struggling

economy in which investment opportunities lie abroad rather than at home. Some countries, such as China,

seem to have a virtuous circle whereby a surplus in the current account and a positive net FDI inflow leads to

an increase in their net exports in the future.

_The settlements balance_

Te official settlements balance focuses on the operations that the monetary authorities have to undertake to

!nance any combined imbalance in the sum of the current account and !nancial account. With the settlements

concept, the autonomous items are all the current and !nancial and capital account transactions including

errors, while the accommodating items are those transactions that the monetary authorities have undertaken

as indicated by the settlements balance. Te current account and capital account items are all regarded as

being induced by independent households, !rms and central and local government and are regarded as the

autonomous items. If the sum of the current and capital accounts is negative, the country can be regarded

as being in de!cit as this has to be !nanced by the authorities drawing on their reserves of foreign currency,

borrowing from foreign monetary authorities or the IMF.

Te official settlements concept of a surplus or de!cit is not as relevant to countries that have floating

exchange rates as it is to those with !xed exchange rates. Tis is because if exchange rates are le, to float

freely the official settlements balance will tend to zero because the central authorities neither purchase nor

sell their currency and so there will be no changes in their reserves. If the sales of a currency exceed the

purchases, then the currency will depreciate; if sales are less than purchases, the currency appreciates. Te

settlements concept is, however, very important under !xed exchange rates because it shows the amount of

pressure on the authorities to devalue or revalue the currency. Under a !xed exchange rate system a country

that is running an official settlements de!cit will !nd that sales of its currency exceed purchases, and to avert

a devaluation of the currency authorities have to sell reserves of foreign currency to purchase the home

currency. On the other hand, under floating exchange rates and no intervention, the official settlements

balance automatically tends to zero as the authorities do not buy or sell the home currency, since it is le, to

appreciate or depreciate.

Even in a !xed exchange rate regime the settlements concept ignores the fact that the authorities have

- ther instruments available with which to defend the exchange rate, such as capital controls and interest rates.
Also, it does not reveal the real threat to the domestic currency and official reserves represented by the liquid
liabilities held by domestic and foreign residents that might switch suddenly out of the currency.

Although in 1973 the major industrialized countries switched from a !xed to a floating exchange rate

system, many developing countries continue to peg their exchange rate to the US dollar and consequently

attach much signi!cance to the settlements balance. Indeed, to the extent that industrialized countries

continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market to influence the value of their currencies, the settlements

balance retains some signi!cance, and news about changes in the reserves of the authorities is of interest to

foreign exchange dealers as a guide to the amount of official intervention in the foreign exchange market.

Te IMF provides an annual summary of the balance of payments statistics using these alternative concepts

- f balance of payments disequilibrium. Its balance of payments statistics for eight major nations in 2019 are
presented in Table 2.3. Table 2.4 summarizes the key balance of payments concepts.

Having looked at the balance of statistics we will now proceed to analyse the record US balance of payment

de!cits and how the current account is an integral part of the national income accounts. We will also examine

the impact of changes in government expenditure and exports upon both the economy and the current account.

The Balance of Payments

**Table 2.4** Summary of key balance of payments concepts

2.8 THE NET INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

When a country invests abroad in foreign bonds, equities and money market securities it is increasing its

holding of external !nancial assets. On the other hand, when foreigners purchase domestic bonds, equities

and domestic money market securities these !nancial investments are liabilities of the domestic residents to

the foreign residents. Te di$erence between a country's ownership of foreign !nancial assets and its !nancial

liabilities to foreign residents is known as its net international investment position (NIIP). If the external

!nancial assets are greater than the external !nancial liabilities then the NIIP of the country will be positive

and the country is a net creditor nation. If, however, the liabilities are greater than the assets then the NIIP of

the country is negative and it is a net debtor.

If a country runs a current account de!cit then this will mean it has to be !nanced by either selling assets

to foreigners or borrowing the funds, which will worsen its NIIP position by making it less positive or more

negative, other things being equal. On the other hand, if a country runs a current account surplus then it earns

more than it spends as a country and so thereby lends money to the rest of the world and/or repays debts it

- wes to the rest of the world, so increasing its assets and/or decreasing its liabilities, thus making its NIIP less
negative or more positive, other things being equal. Such a country's current account de!cit/surplus can, over
time, have a signi!cant impact on its NIIP position.

47

International Finance

However, the NIIP is also a$ected by things other than the current account. One of the other major determinants

is valuation changes in the external !nancial assets and liabilities of the country. For example, if foreign stock

markets and foreign bonds held by the domestic residents rise in value then the NIIP position improves, while

if they fall in value the NIIP deteriorates. Similarly, a fall in the valuation of domestic !nancial securities held by

foreign residents will improve the NIIP, while rises in their value lead to a deterioration in the NIIP.

Te other factor that heavily influences the NIIP is fluctuations in the exchange rate. Consider the case of

the United States. It has a negative NIIP since the value of its foreign assets measured in US dollars is less than

the value of its liabilities as measured in US dollars. If the US dollar depreciates by 10% then its foreign assets

become worth more, measured in US dollars, while its liabilities are not directly a$ected by the fall in the

dollar and this therefore improves its NIIP, while an appreciation reduces the value of foreign !nancial assets,

as measured in US dollars, so leading to a deterioration in the US NIIP. Of course, for foreign economies

such as Japan and China a depreciation of the dollar will mean an appreciation of their currencies, which

reduces the value of their claims on the United States when measured in yen and renminbi, so leading to a

deterioration in their NIIP positions as measured in yen and renminbi.

Table 2.5 shows the net international investment position of the United States and how it has gone from

being a net creditor country of \$360 billion in 1980 to a net debtor nation of \$13,950 billion in 2020. A major

cause of this has been the fact that the US has been running current account de!cits ever since 1982, which

have to be !nanced by either selling assets to foreign residents or increasing liabilities to foreign residents. Of

course the NIIP is also a$ected by changes in the market values of the assets and liabilities. So even though the

US had large current account de!cits in 2009 and 2010, its NIIP actually improved from minus \$3,260 billion

in 2008 to minus \$2,471 billion as the market value of its liabilities measured in dollars rose by less than the

market value of its assets measured in US dollars.

While the United States is currently a net debtor nation, as Tables 2.5 and 2.6 show, it is not alone. Te

UK, France and Italy are all net debtor nations as measured by their NIIPs. By contrast, countries that

tend%to run persistent current account surpluses such as Germany, China and Japan are all creditor nations

as measured by their NIIPs. Tis makes sense, as countries that run persistent de!cits have to !nance the

de!cits by selling foreign assets and increasing their liabilities, while countries that run persistent surpluses

increase their foreign assets by lending and/or are able to reduce their liabilities to foreign residents.

2.9 DO THE UNITED STATES CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS MATTER?

Since 1982 the United States current account has moved from a position of a small surplus to ever-increasing

de!cits, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of gross domestic product. Te plain fact is that for four

decades the United States' economy as a whole has been consistently spending abroad more than it has been

earning from abroad; the country as a whole has also been spending more than it has been producing and

making up the di$erence by borrowing from abroad. Te ever-increasing size of the current account de!cits

and their signi!cance and sustainability has provoked an intense debate between economists about the

desirability and sustainability of these de!cits. As can be seen in Table 2.7 the size of these de!cits widened

dramatically in the run up to the credit crunch, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP.

In 1982 the United States was the world's biggest creditor nation, but it is now the world's biggest debtor

nation – its NIIP at the end of 2020Q3 being a negative \$13,950 billion or around 66.6% of US GDP, up from

- nly 3.6% of GDP in 1995. At any point in time, the United States' NIIP !gure is a$ected by three factors: (1)
the size of the US current account – a current account de!cit means the NIIP will worsen by the amount of the
current account de!cit since it needs to borrow the equivalent sum from foreign residents; (2) changes in%the
local currency values of US assets and liabilities, for example the value of foreign stocks and bonds held by US
residents (US assets) and the value of US stocks and bonds held by foreign residents (US liabilities) – if US
holdings of foreign stocks and bonds rise in price more than foreign holdings of US stocks and bonds this helps
to improve the United States' NIIP; and (3) changes in the dollar exchange rate, for example a depreciation of
the dollar against the euro will raise the dollar value of US residents' holdings of euro-denominated assets and
thereby help improve the United States' NIIP.

Another problem for the United States, as Mann (2002) points out, is that its income elasticity of demand

for imports appears to be quite high at 1.80, while the foreign income elasticity of demand for US exports

is quite low at 0.8. Tis asymmetry of how US economic growth a$ects imports and how world economic

growth a$ects US exports means that if the US economy and the rest of the world grow at the same rate, the

current account de!cit will continue to widen unless the exchange rate of the dollar persistently depreciates

(see also Obstfeld and Rogo$, 2000).

Roubini and Setser (2004) show that there was a decreased appetite for US investments on the part of

the foreign private sector in terms of less willingness to hold US stocks and bonds. However, this lack of

private sector demand has been replaced by heavy Asian central bank intervention attempting to prevent their

currencies appreciating against the dollar. In particular, the Bank of Japan and the People's Bank of China were

large purchasers of US dollar Treasury securities – Asian bank holdings of US Treasury bonds have increased

dramatically since 2000. Without such heavy purchases the dollar might have fallen quite signi!cantly on a

trade-weighted basis and this may also account for why US Treasury bond yields have been very low over this

period, despite large !scal de!cits under the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations.

Clearly, however, there is a limit to the amount that foreign central banks will be willing to purchase of

US-denominated assets since the more they purchase the greater their losses could be should the dollar

depreciate or US interest rates rise. Should such purchases cease, then it would be difficult for the United

States to attract the capital inflow required to !nance its current account de!cits without either a large

depreciation of the dollar making US assets look cheap to purchase and/or a rise in US interest rates to

attract foreign investors.

Some economists, such as Cooper (2001), are less worried about the US de!cits, arguing that the United

States is a strong highly productive economy which is dynamic and innovative, with well-functioning goods,

labour and capital markets (with liquid securities), combined with political stability that will make good use

- f the borrowed money over time, providing foreign investors with a relatively 'high and reliable' return on
their investments. Cooper (2001, pp. 219–20) states that:

50

The Balance of Payments

Te language of current account de!cits is unfortunate: it reverses the economic logic and suggests that

in the U.S. case a de!cit is undesirable, even though it reflects a vote of con!dence by the rest of the

world in the United States, or at least in claims on Americans. Put another way, the United States has

demonstrated strong comparative advantage in exporting stocks, bonds, bank deposits, and other claims

  - n such U.S. assets as real estate and U.S. domiciled !rms under foreign management control (that is,
foreign direct investment) … Nearly half of all foreign claims on the United States are interest bearing,
and U.S. interest rates in recent years have been higher than those in Europe, and much higher than
in Japan. Tis has allowed the United States to attract and hold funds from those areas and elsewhere.
Other parts of the world have been through !nancial crises, resulting in higher interest rates, but also in
much greater uncertainty about their exchange rates and even the prospect of repayment.

Cooper (2007) argues that, while the rest of the world tends to invest heavily in US Treasuries which pay

relatively low yields, the United States tends to invest heavily abroad in foreign equities and companies which

tend to generate higher yields over the longer run. As such, he argues that the US can continue to run de!cits

since its debt repayments are on average much lower than the return on its holdings of foreign assets.

McKinnon (2001, p. 229) argues that because the dollar is a vehicle currency widely used for trade invoicing,

by !nancial markets, !nancial institutions and by central banks, the demand for US dollar-denominated assets

will remain strong: 'this status of the dollar as international money, providing the central currency in the world

system, is a natural monopoly'. Even if private-sector demand for the dollar were to wane, McKinnon (2001,

p. 237) is con!dent the slack would be taken up by foreign central banks keen to prevent their currencies

appreciating against the dollar:

Absent monetary instability in the center country, the dollar standard is robust and could continue

without the United States running up against signi!cant borrowing constraints from the rest of the

world. Any incipient run on the dollar would be o$set by foreign central banks accumulating dollar

reserves in order to prevent their currencies from appreciating, because to do otherwise would impose

a loss on their countries' international mercantile competitiveness.

Tere are examples of other advanced economies accumulating net international debt of over 50% of GDP

without obvious adverse e$ects. Australia’s NIIP in 2011 was a negative 64% of GDP and New Zealand’s

was a negative 90% of GDP. However, countries like Spain (negative 87% of GDP in 2011), Greece (negative

83% in 2011) and Portugal (negative 108% in 2011), who have all su$ered signi!cant crises especially in the

period 2010–13 suggest there are signi!cant dangers. Others authors, such as Roubini and Setser (2004), are

also sceptical about the US ability to !nance its de!cits, pointing out that the USA is a large economy and

is consuming a disproportionate amount of world savings to !nance its current account de!cit. In addition,

Mann (2002, p. 149) warns:

Te global investor may continue for a time to increase holdings of U.S. assets, particularly if the relative

risk-reward pro!le holds up. At some point, however, global investors will reach, or even go beyond, the

desired proportion of U.S. assets in their portfolios. If the current account de!cit continues to be large

at a time when global investors no longer wish to add more U.S. assets to their portfolio, the current

account de!cit will not be sustainable, and an economic adjustment must occur.

Several mechanisms could lead to an eventual correction of the US current account de!cit: (1) a rise in real

US interest rates which would lead to more private savings and less private investment, with an accompanying

slowdown in the US economy and net imports; (2) a depreciation of the dollar in real trade-weighted terms

51

International Finance

which over time should increase US exports and decrease imports; (3) a decrease in the US budget de!cit via

a mixture of tax rises and/or a decrease in government expenditure which would again slow the US economy

and decrease imports; and (4) an increase in economic growth rates in countries and regions like Japan,

Europe and Asia which would increase the demand for US exports.

One advantage that the USA does have over many other countries is that its external debt is denominated

in its own currency, unlike typical emerging market economies that o,en have much of their external debt

denominated in foreign currencies; hence it can always print the money to service and redeem its debts, for

example US Treasury bonds held by foreign central banks. In this sense the USA has a large advantage over

most emerging market economies: a rapid depreciation of the dollar would not increase the real cost to the

United States of servicing its debt, whereas currency crises in emerging markets leading to the depreciation

- f their currencies against the dollar have had major adverse consequences for many of their companies and
banks that had dollar-denominated debts.

Tere are clearly signi!cant risks to foreign holders of US assets, such as the Bank of Japan and the

People's Bank of China that have large holdings of US securities and who would su$er substantial losses if US

interest rates rise and/or the dollar depreciates. Since US liabilities in 2020 are around \$43.2 trillion there are

potentially substantial losses to foreigners; from each 10% decline of the dollar they would lose approximately

\$4.34 trillion as measured in their own currencies. As Roubini and Setser (2004, p. 6) have warned:

No doubt the dollar's position as the world's reserve currency and the depth of U.S. !nancial markets

creates an intrinsic source of demand for both dollars and dollar denominated assets. However, this

could prove to be a mixed blessing. Te dollar's privileged position could increase the risk that the world

will !nance large U.S. trade de!cits for too long, leading to excessive U.S. debt accumulation. Tis will

let the U.S. delay needed adjustment, but increase the cost of the adjustment when it !nally happens.

In the longer run, it is clear that the US current account de!cits do matter, since increasing external

indebtedness raises the interest payments the US has to make to the rest of the world, which implies less

money to buy goods/services in the future. A large structural current account de!cit also acts as a constraint

- n economic growth since strong economic growth leads to even bigger current account de!cits (unless it is
export-led economic growth). Also, increased external indebtedness over time increases the probability of
there being a sharp correction at some point in the future, which would imply a signi!cant fall in the dollar, a
rise in US interest rates and possibly a prolonged and signi!cant recession for the US economy. Tere is also
the risk of a !nancial crisis resulting from a loss of con!dence on the part of !nancial markets and foreign
central banks about the potential for a large depreciation of the US dollar. Finally, of course, there is the threat

- f protectionism: the larger the US current account de!cits and the correspondingly greater the bilateral
surpluses of Japan and China, the greater the risks that protectionist elements in the USA will surface.

2.10 SOME OPEN ECONOMY IDENTITIES

In an open economy, gross domestic product (GDP) di$ers from that of a closed economy because there is

an additional injection – export expenditure which represents foreign expenditure on domestically produced

goods. Tere is also an additional leakage – expenditure on imports which represents domestic expenditure

- n foreign goods and raises foreign national income. Te identity for an open economy is given by:

_Y_             - _C_             - � _I_ _G_             - _X_             - _M_ (2.1)

52

The Balance of Payments

where _Y_ is national income, _C_ is domestic consumption, _I_ is domestic investment, _G_ is government expenditure,

_X_ is export expenditure and _M_ is import expenditure.

If we deduct taxation _T_ from the right-hand side of equation (2.1) we have:

_Yd_ [�] + _C_ _I_ + _G_ + _X_                  - _M_                  - _T_ (2.2)

where _Y_ d is disposable income.

If we denote private savings as _S_ = _Y_ d – _C_ we can rearrange equation (2.2) to obtain:

( _X_   - _M_ )   - ( _S_   - _I_ )

(2.3)

Equation (2.3) is an important identity: it says that a current account de!cit has a counterpart in either

private dissaving, that is, private investment exceeding private saving and/or in a government de!cit, that

is, government expenditure exceeding government taxation revenue. Te equation is merely an identity and

says nothing about causation. Nonetheless, it is o,en stated that the current account de!cit is due to the lack

- f private savings and/or the government budget de!cit. However, it is possible that the causation runs the
- ther way: that it is the current account de!cit that may be responsible for the lack of private savings or budget
de!cit. Te identity has been much talked about since the 1980s (see Box 2.1).

**Box 2.1 Current accounts and government fiscal policies**

Te fact that a country's current account (CA) is made up of the government budget surplus/de!cit and

net private savings/dissavings has led to very di$erent perspectives on current account imbalances. Table

2.8 shows the relevant components for the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan.

Interesting comparisons were made between the current account de!cits of the USA and the UK in

the 1980s. Many economists blamed the rapidly growing US current account de!cit from 1982 onwards

as due to the steep rise in the US budget de!cit from 1.4% of GDP in 1980 to an average 3.5% of GDP in

1986. Te UK current account moved into a heavy de!cit from 1987 onwards; however, because the UK

government was running a budget surplus, it claimed that the current account position was primarily

a private-sector phenomenon due to high investment and there was no need for remedial action by the

government. Te contrasts naturally led economists to propose di$erent solutions to the de!cits in both

countries. Much of the US policy debate was concerned with reducing the federal budget de!cit, while

discussion in the UK focused upon measures designed to encourage private-sector savings (reducing

private consumption) and reduce investment. Te UK government pursued a tight monetary policy

with a signi!cant rise in UK interest rates.

Te United States' current account has worsened considerably since 1998, and by 2006 the de!cit

had reached record proportions of 6.0% of GDP. Again, there was much focus on the size of the budget

de!cits, following President Bush's tax cuts, but also on low savings and the pick-up in investment

resulting from the extremely low short-term interest rate policy pursued by the Federal Reserve

following the large falls in the US stock market and the bust of 'dot com' stocks (the Federal Reserve cut

the Fed funds rate from 6.5% in June 2000 to a mere 1% in July 2003).

Many economists believe that the reason why Germany and Japan had such persistent surpluses

in their current accounts in the 1980s was that they have had much higher savings ratios. Following

German reuni!cation, however, the German current account position deteriorated noticeably due to

a combination of worsening public !nances, brought on by the huge cost of propping up the former

East German economy, and a consumer boom as East Germans went on a spending spree following

the conversion of their East German Ostmarks into German marks at a very generous one to one

parity.

One must, however, be careful not to imply causation from what is in fact merely an accounting

identity. Tis is clearly illustrated by comparing the !scal deterioration in the cases of both the United

States and Japan. In the USA the !scal deterioration from 2000 onwards, due to a combination of tax

cuts and a slowing economy, is clearly associated with a widening current account de!cit; while in Japan,

post-1994, there was a signi!cant worsening of the !scal position, accompanied by an improvement in

the Japanese current account! From the mid-1990s, the Japanese !scal position deteriorated noticeably,

but the current account remained in surplus due in part to even higher savings on the part of the

Japanese worried about the e$ects of economic recession. Indeed, from 1998 onwards, as the Japanese

!scal de!cit increased, it seems that Japanese consumers – possibly worried about the implications of

these large !scal de!cits for their prospective future tax liabilities – saved even more, ensuring that the

current account remained in surplus.

Equation (2.3) can be rearranged to yield:

_I_                         - _G_                         - _X_                         - _S_                         - _T_                         - _M_ (2.4)

Tis shows that the equilibrium level of national income is determined where injections (the variables on the

le,-hand side) are equal to leakages (the variables on the right-hand side). Injections are all those factors that

work to raise national income, while leakages are those factors that work to lower national income. Equation

(2.4) is an important identity to which we shall return in Chapter 4.

2.11 OPEN ECONOMY MULTIPLIERS

John Maynard Keynes in his classic work _Te General Teory of Employment, Interest and Money_ published

in 1936 pioneered the use of multiplier analysis to examine the e$ects of changes in government expenditure

and investment on output and employment. However, his work was concerned almost exclusively with a

closed economy. It was not long, however, before the ideas of Keynes' work were applied to an analysis of open

economies, most notably by Fritz Machlup (1943).

Te assumptions underlying basic multiplier analysis are: (1) both domestic prices and the exchange rate

are !xed; (2) the economy is operating at less than full employment so that increases in demand result in an

expansion of output; and (3) the authorities adjust the money supply to changes in money demand by pegging

the domestic interest rate. Tis latter assumption is important: increases in output that lead to a rise in money

demand would, with a !xed money supply, lead to a rise in the domestic interest rate – it is assumed that the

authorities passively expand the money stock to meet any increase in money demand so that interest rates do

not have to change. Tere is no inflation resulting from the money supply expansion because it is merely a

response to the increase in money demand.

Te starting point for the analysis is the identity of equation (2.1), repeated here:

_Y_              - _C_              - � _I_ _G_              - _X_              - _M_ (2.5)

Keynesian analysis proceeds to make assumptions concerning the determinants of the various components of

national income. Government expenditure and exports are assumed to be exogenous, government expenditure

being determined independently by political decision, and exports by foreign expenditure decisions and

foreign income.

We now introduce taxes into the picture. Te simplest way to do this is to assume that taxes are proportional

to income:

_T_ = _tY_ (2.6)

where _t_ is the marginal rate of taxation.

Domestic consumption is partly autonomous and partly determined by the level of disposable national

income, that is, the national income less taxes, i.e. (1 – _t_ ) _Y_ . Tis is denoted algebraically by:

_C_ = _C_ a + _c_ (1– _t_ ) _Y_ (2.7)

where _C_ a is autonomous consumption and _c_ is the marginal propensity to consume, that is, the fraction of any

increase in disposable income that is spent on consumption. In this simple model, consumption is assumed to

56

The Balance of Payments

be a linear function of disposable income. An increase in consumers' disposable income induces an increase

in their consumption.

Import expenditure is assumed to be partly autonomous and partly a positive function of the level of

domestic income:

_M_            - _M_ a            - _mY_ (2.8)

where _M_ a is autonomous import expenditure and _m_ is the marginal propensity to import, that is, the fraction

- f any increase in income that is spent on imports. In this simple formulation import expenditure is assumed
to be a positive linear function of income. Tere are several justi!cations for this. Increased income leads
to increased expenditure on imports, but more domestic production normally requires more imports of
intermediate goods. Since we have assumed that domestic prices are !xed this means that income _Y_ also
represents real income.

If we substitute equations (2.7) and (2.8) into equation (2.5) we obtain:

_Y_ = _C_ a + _c_ (1 – _t_ ) _Y_ + _I_ + _G_ + _X_            - _M_ a – _mY_

Terefore:

_Y_ [1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ) + _m_ ] = _C_ a + _I_ + _G_ + _X_            - _M_ a

Hence we obtain:

1

_Y_             - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )             - _m_ ( _[C]_ _a_             - � _I_ _G_             - _X_             - _Ma_ ) (2.9)

Equation (2.9) can be transformed into di$erence form to yield:

1

d _Y_             - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )             - _m_ (d _Ca_             - d _I_             - d _G_             - d _X_             - d _Ma_ ) (2.10)

where d in front of a variable represents the change in the variable. From equation (2.10) we can obtain some

simple open economy multipliers.

_The government expenditure multiplier_

Te !rst multiplier of interest is the government expenditure multiplier, which shows the increase in national

income resulting from a given increase in government expenditure. Tis is given by:

d _Y_ 1

d _G_                 - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )                 - _m_                 - 0 (2.11)

Equation (2.11) says that an increase in government expenditure will have an expansionary e$etc on national

income, the size of which depends upon the marginal propensity to consume, the tax rate and the marginal

propensity to import.

57

International Finance

Since [1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ) + _m_ ] is less than unity, an increase in government expenditure will result in an even

greater increase in national income. Furthermore, the value of the open economy multiplier is less than the

closed economy multiplier which is given by 1/[1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ )]. Te reason for this is that increased expenditure

is spent on both domestic and foreign goods rather than domestic goods alone, and the expenditure on foreign

goods raises foreign rather than domestic income.

Numerical Example

Assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the tax rate is 25% of income, i.e. _t_ = 0.25, and the

marginal propensity to import is 0.3. Te e$etc of an increase in government expenditure of £100 million on

national income is given by:

1 4286. - £100m - £14

1 4286. - £100m - £14 **2** 86. m

- m 

m

Hence, an increase of government expenditure of £100 million will raise eventual national income by £142.86

million. Tis is because 25% of the £100 million increase in income i.e. £25 million will go in income taxes,

leaving £75 million, of which consumers spend £60 million (since marginal propensity to consume is 0.8). Tis

is divided between £30 million on domestic goods and the remaining £30 million of imports (i.e. 0.3 × £100

million), giving a further £30 million increase in incomes, of which 30% will eventually get spent on domestic

goods, giving a further £9 million increase in incomes, of which a further 30%, i.e. £2.7 million, of that gets spent

- n domestic goods and so on. Te summation limit of such a series of expenditure rounds is £142.86 million.

_The foreign trade or export multiplier_

In this simple model, the multiplier e$etc of an increase in exports on national income is identical to that

- f an increase in government expenditure. Tis is given by: d _Y_ /d _X_ =1/[1– _c_ (1– _t_ )+ _m_ ]. In practice, it is o,en
the case that government expenditure tends to be somewhat more biased to domestic output than private
consumption expenditure, implying that the value of _m_ is smaller in the case of the government expenditure
multiplier than in the case of the export multiplier. If this is the case, an increase in government expenditure
will have a more expansionary e$etc on domestic output than an equivalent increase in exports.

Numerical Example

Assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the tax rate is 25% of income, i.e. _t_ = 0.25 and the

marginal propensity to import is 0.3. Te e$etc of an increase in export expenditure of £100 million on

national income is given by

Hence, the e$ect of an increase in exports of £100 million is to boost national income by £142.86 million

which is the same e$etc as an increase in government expenditure of £100 million.

In practice, it is o,en the case that government expenditure tends to be somewhat more biased to domestic

- output than private consumption expenditure, implying that the value of _m_ is smaller in the case of the
government expenditure multiplier than in the case of the export multiplier. If this is the case, an increase in
government expenditure will have a more expansionary e$etc on domestic output than an equivalent increase
in exports.

_The current account multipliers_

Te other relationships of interest are the e$ects of an increase in government expenditure and of exports on

the current account (CA) balance. Rearranging equation (2.5) we have:

_Y_               - _C_               - _I_               - _G_ + _M_               - _X_ = 0

Substituting in equations (2.7) and (2.8) yields:

_Y_                 - _c_ (1                 - _t_ ) _Y_ + _mY_                 - _C_ a + _M_ a                 - _I_                 - _G_                 - _X_ = 0

Hence:

_Y_ [1            - _c_ (1            - _t_ ) + _m_ ]            - _C_ a + _M_ a            - _I_            - _G_            - _X_ = 0

Multiplying by _m_ /[1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ) + _m_ ] yields:

_m_

_mY_          - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )          - _m_ ( _[C]_ _a_          - _Ma_          - � _I_ _G_          - _X_ )          - 0

Adding _M_ a and _X_ to each side, recalling that _M_ = _M_ a + _mY_, and rearranging yields:

_m_

_CA_        - _X_        - _M_        - _X_        - _Ma_        - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )        - _m_ ( _[C]_ _a_        - _Ma_        - � _I_ _G_        - _X_ ) (2.12)

Equation (2.12) can now be expressed in di$erence form as:

_m_

d _CA_          - d _X_          - d _Ma_          - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )          - _m_ (d _Ca_          - d _Ma_          - d _I_          - d _G_          - d _X_ ) (2.13)

59

International Finance

From equation (2.13) we can derive the e$ects of an increase in government expenditure on the current

account balance which is given by:

_dCA dG_ /            - � _m_ /[1� _c_ (1� _t_ )            - _m_ ]            - 0

Tat is, an increase in government spending leads to a deterioration of the current account balance, which is

some fraction of the initial increase in government expenditure. Tis is because economic agents spend part

- f the increase in income on imports.

Numerical Example

Assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the rate of taxation on income is 25%, i.e. _t_ = 0.25, and

the marginal propensity to import is 0.3. Te e$etc of an increase in government expenditure of £100 million

- � 

Tat is, an increase in government expenditure leads to an eventual deterioration in the current account of

£42.86 million. Te reason is that the increased government expenditure of £100 million, because of the open

economy multiplier, increases national income by £142.86 million. Since the marginal propensity to import is

0.3, the £142.86 million increase in income leads to a 0.3 × £142.86m = £42.86m increase in imports, which

corresponds to the deterioration in the current account.

Te other multiplier of interest is the e$etc of an increase in exports on the current balance. Tis is given

by the expression:

_c_

Since (1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ))/[1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ) + _m_ )] is less than unity, an increase in exports leads to an improvement in the

current balance that is less than the original increase in exports. Te explanation for this is that part of the

improvement in the current account resulting from the additional exports is o$set to some extent by increased

expenditure on imports due to the associated rise in the national income.

60

The Balance of Payments

Numerical Example

Assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the tax rate is 25%, _t_ = 0.25, and the marginal

propensity to import is 0.3. Te e$etc of an increase in exports of £100 million on the current account is given

by:

d

_CA_

1 _c_ (1 _t_ ) 1 0 8 1. ( 0 25. )

0 8 1. ( 0 25. )

m £57 14. m

Te explanation is that the £100m increase in exports initially improves the current account by a like amount.

However, it also generates an eventual increase of national income of £142.86 million which induces an

increase in imports of £42.86 million, so the net improvement in the current account is limited to the £100

million increase in exports minus the £42.86 million in imports, giving a net improvement in the current

account of £57.14 million.

Te simple multiplier analysis that we have looked at here shows that Keynesian income e$ects are an

essential part of balance of payments analysis, and that the current account of the balance of payments is an

integral part of macroeconomic equilibrium for an open economy. Another important conclusion is that an

analysis of macroeconomic fluctuations for an open economy requires consideration of what is happening

in foreign economies: increases in foreign income raise the exports and income of the home economy. Te

foreign trade multiplier analysis deals with what happens to the balance of payments when income changes,

assuming that prices are held constant.

2.12 CONCLUSIONS

From the discussion we can see that there are a variety of concepts of balance of payments disequilibrium. Te

very fact that there is no single agreed-upon de!nition is not surprising: the choice of which concept is most

relevant depends upon the exchange rate regime and the particular purpose of the analysis being undertaken.

Each of the concepts has a di$erent information content and, taken together, they provide an important

indicator about the macro-performance of an open economy. In the short run, however, it is inevitable that

the trade and current account balances capture the attention of macroeconomic policy-makers because they

are published so frequently. Furthermore, it is not what happens so much in any given quarter's balance of

payments that is signi!cant, but what the statistics reveal over a period of time about the direction of an

economy.

An important point to be borne in mind is that it is necessary to bring in a time dimension when analysing

balance of payments statistics. A de!cit is not necessarily a bad thing if it is likely to be followed by future

surpluses and vice versa. In this respect, it can be argued that it is necessary to look at the composition of

goods that a country is importing. If the imported goods are predominantly consumer goods like cars and

consumer electronics, then it might be argued that the de!cit is more worrying than when the imports are

plant and machinery that could be important in generating future exports.

61

International Finance

Another point that needs to be borne in mind when considering if a current account de!cit or surplus is a

signi!cant problem is whether or not the country concerned is a net creditor or debtor vis-à-vis the rest of the

world. A current account de!cit means that the country concerned is increasing its indebtedness or reducing

its claims on the rest of the world. If the country is a net creditor it can usually a$ord to do this, whereas if it is

a net debtor the de!cit may be regarded as a more serious problem. Tis is why the de!cits of the United States

have caused some concern because the country has become the world's largest debtor. By contrast, there was

much less concern about the German current account de!cits resulting from German reuni!cation because

past German surpluses have made it a net creditor vis-à-vis the rest of the world.

Another factor to bear in mind when looking at a country's current account position is the potential cause

- f the de!cit or surplus. If a country has a large de!cit due to a large government budget de!cit, then the
remedy may well require reducing government expenditure and/or raising taxes. If, however, the de!cit is due
to high investment, then there is a good chance that future export growth will reduce the de!cit and corrective
policy action may not be necessary. Alternatively, the current account de!cit may be due to a consumer
boom (reflected in low savings), so a tightening of monetary policy in the form of higher interest rates may
be needed. In any case, some sort of analysis of causes is crucial to appraising whether a de!cit or surplus is
a policy problem.

Finally, when analysing a country's balance of payments statistics and attempting to assess whether the

country is facing or is likely to face problems in the near future, it is important to remember that whatever

concept of balance of payments disequilibrium is used it gives only a partial view of the economy. If a country

has a current account de!cit, high inflation and low economic growth, then the balance of payments problem

is more worrying than if the de!cit is accompanied by high economic growth and low inflation.
