3.1 INTRODUCTION

In the opening two chapters we have introduced the exchange rate and the balance of payments. In this

chapter, we will investigate the relationship between the exchange rate and the balance of payments. In

particular, we shall be studying two models that investigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the

current account position of a country. Tese two approaches are popularly known as the 'elasticity approach'

and the 'absorption approach'. Both models were designed to tackle one of the most important questions in

international economics – will a devaluation (or depreciation) of the exchange rate lead to a reduction of

a current account de!cit? Te answer to this question is of crucial importance because if an exchange rate

change cannot be relied upon to ensure adjustment of the current account, then policy-makers will have to

rely on other instruments to improve the position.

We will start the chapter by examining the impact of exchange rate changes according to the elasticity

approach which looks at the impact of exchange rate changes, assuming domestic and foreign prices are

!xed. Tis is followed by an analysis of the absorption model which examines the e$ects of the exchange rate

in terms of its impact on domestic income and spending. We will conclude by analysing the similarities and

di$erences between the two models. For simplicity, throughout this chapter we shall ignore the complications

- f unilateral transfers and interest, pro!t and dividends on the current account balance and concentrate on
the export and import of goods and services. _Troughout this chapter, the exchange rate is defined as domestic_
_currency units per unit of foreign currency, so that a devaluation/depreciation of the currency is represented by_
_a rise in the exchange rate_ .

3.2 THE ELASTICITY APPROACH TO THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

Te elasticity approach to the balance of payments provides an analysis of what happens to the current

account balance when a country devalues its currency. Te analysis was pioneered by Alfred Marshall (1923)

and Abba Lerner (1944), and later extended by Joan Robinson (1937) and Fritz Machlup (1939). At the outset,

the model makes some simplifying assumptions: it focuses on demand conditions and assumes that the supply

elasticities for the domestic export good and foreign import good are perfectly elastic, so that changes in

demand volumes have no e$ect on prices. In e$etc, these assumptions mean that domestic and foreign prices

are !xed so that changes in relative prices are caused by changes in the nominal exchange rate.

Te central message of the elasticity approach is that there are two direct e$ects of a devaluation on the

current balance, one of which works to reduce a de!cit, whilst the other actually contributes to making the

de!cit worse than before. Let us consider these two e$ects in some detail.

Te current account balance, when expressed in terms of the domestic currency, is given by:

_CA_ = _P_ _X_ v – _S_ _P_             - _M_ v (3.1)

where _P_ is the domestic price level, _X_ v is the volume of domestic exports, _S_ is the exchange rate (domestic

currency units per unit of foreign currency), _P_ - is the foreign price level and _M_ v is the volume of imports.

We shall set the domestic and foreign price levels at unity; the value of domestic exports ( _P X_ v) is given by _X_,

while the foreign currency value of imports ( _P_ - _M_ v) is given by _M_ . Using these simpli!cations equation (3.1)

becomes:

_CA_ = _X_              - _S_ _M_ (3.2)

In di$erence form equation (3.2) becomes:

dCA = d _X_                - _S_ d _M_                - _M_ d _S_ (3.3)

Dividing equation (3.3) by the change in the exchange rate d _S_, we obtain:

d

_CA_ d _X_ d d

At this point we introduce two de!nitions. First, the price elasticity of demand for exports ( _x_ is de!ned as the

percentage change in exports over the percentage change in price as represented by the percentage change in

the exchange rate, giving:

d _X_ / X

_S S_

so that

Elasticity and Absorption Approaches to the Balance of Payments

Second, the price elasticity of demand for imports ( _m_ is de!ned as the percentage change in imports over

the percentage change in their price as represented by the percentage change in the exchange rate (we place a

negative as we wish to express elasticity as a positive number):

d _M M_ /

                - _m_                

d / _S S_

so that

_m SM_ d

d _M_                  - � [�] (3.6)

Substituting equations (3.5) and (3.6) into equation (3.4) we obtain:

   - [�] _m_    - 1

d _S M_

_xX_

- [�] - � _m_ - 1 (3.7)
_SM_

Assuming that we initially have balanced trade, _X_ / _SM_ = 1, and rearranging equation (3.7) yields:

d

 - _M_ (��� _x_ _m_  - 1) (3.8)
_S_

_CA_

  - _M_ (��� _x_ _m_  - 1)

d _S_

Equation (3.8) is known as the Marshall–Lerner condition and states that, starting from a position of

equilibrium in the current account, a devaluation will improve the current account, that is, d _CA_ /d _S_ - 0 only

if the sum of the foreign elasticity of demand for exports and the home country elasticity of demand for

imports is greater than unity; that is, ( _x_ + ( _m_ >1. If the sum of these two elasticities is less than unity, then a

devaluation will lead to a deterioration of the current account.

Te economic explanation of this result is illustrated in Table 3.1 which shows the pre-devaluation and

three possible post-devaluation scenarios. Before devaluation the sterling–dollar exchange rate is £0.6667/\$1

(\$1.5/£1), whereas a,er the devaluation it is £0.80/$1 ($1.25/£1). Te price of one unit of UK exports is £1 and

the price of one unit of US exports is \$5.

Tere are two e$ects in play once a currency is devalued:

1. **Te price effect**   - exports become cheaper measured in foreign currency: a UK export earns only

\$1.25 post-devaluation compared to \$1.50 prior to devaluation. Imports become more expensive

measured in the home currency, each unit of imports costs £3.33 prior to the devaluation but

costs £4 post-devaluation. Te price e$etc clearly contributes to a worsening of the UK current

account.

2. **Te volume effect**   - the fact that exports become cheaper should encourage an increased volume

	- f exports, and the fact that imports become more expensive should lead to a decreased volume of
imports. Te volume e$etc clearly contributes to improving the current balance.

Te net e$ect depends upon whether the price or volume e$etc dominates. In Table 3.1 case 1, the increase in

export volumes and decrease in import volumes are not sufficient to outweigh the fact that less is received for

exports and more has to be paid for imports. Te result is that the current account balance moves from balance

into de!cit. Approximate elasticities sum to 0.45. In case 2, the increased export volumes and decreased volume

- f imports exactly match the decreased earnings per unit of exports and increased expenditure per unit of
imports so that the current balance is unchanged. Approximate elasticities sum to 1.08 which is close to unity.
In case 3, the increased volume of export sales and decreased volume of imports are sufficient to outweigh
the price e$ects so that the current balance improves following a devaluation. Approximate elasticities sum to
1.60 which ful!ls the critical Marshall–Lerner condition for a successful devaluation.

A more complicated formula can be derived which allows for supply elasticities of exports and imports

- f less than in!nity. Given the assumption of less-than-in!nite supply elasticity conditions, and assuming
initially balanced trade, Stern (1973, pp. 64–7) has shown that a more complicated condition needs to be
satis!ed; namely, the balance of payments will improve following a devaluation if:

(�� _x_ 1) _m m_ (� - 1)

where . _x_ is the domestic supply elasticity of the export good and . _m_ is the foreign supply elasticity for its export

good (the domestic country's imports). Te e$etc of less-than-in!nite supply price elasticities is to make the

required demand elasticities less stringent in the sense that the current account may improve even if the sum

- f the demand elasticities is less than unity. If the supply price elasticities of exports and imports are less than
in!nite, an increase in demand for exports will lead to some rise in the domestic price of exports which will
give an additional boost to export revenues (when demand is inelastic). Similarly, the fall in the demand for
foreign imports will have the e$ect of reducing the foreign currency price of imports, thus lowering import
expenditure. Both these e$ects are absent under the in!nite supply elasticities we have assumed.

3.3 EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON IMPORT AND EXPORT DEMAND ELASTICITIES

Te possibility that a devaluation may lead to a worsening rather than an improvement in the balance of

payments led to much research into empirical estimates of the elasticity of demand for exports and imports.

Economists were divided into two camps: those popularly known as 'elasticity optimists' who believed that the

sum of these two elasticities tended to exceed unity, and those known as 'elasticity pessimists' who believed that

these elasticities tended to less than unity. It was argued that a devaluation may work better for industrialized

countries than for developing ones. Many developing countries are heavily dependent upon imports, and

their price elasticity of demand for imports was likely to be very low, while for industrialized countries that

have to face competitive export markets the price elasticity of demand for their exports may be quite elastic.

Te implication of the Marshall–Lerner condition was that devaluation may be a cure for some countries'

balance of payments de!cits but not for others.

Tere are enormous problems involved in estimating the elasticity of demand for imports and exports. A

summary by Gylfason (1987) of ten econometric studies undertaken between 1969 and 1981 has shown that

the Marshall–Lerner condition was ful!lled for all of the 15 industrial and 9 developing countries surveyed.

Te results are shown in Table 3.2. They are based on estimates of the elasticities over a twoto three-year time

horizon. As such, while the table demonstrates clearly that a devaluation will improve the current account

- ver such a time span, it does not preclude an initial J-curve e$etc. Indeed, a study by Artus and Knight
(1984) has shown that, up to a period of six months, estimated price elasticities are invariably so low that
the Marshall–Lerner conditions are not ful!lled. Hooper et al. (1998) examine the shortand long-run price
elasticities of demand for imports and exports of the G7 countries from the mid-1950s through to the end of
1996. Te total (import and export demand elasticities) for the short and long run respectively were: Canada
(0.6, 1.8), France (0.2, 0.6), Germany (0.3, 0.4), Italy (0.3, 1.3), Japan (0.6, 1.3), the United Kingdom (0.2, 2.2)
and the United States (0.6, 1.8). Te results show the di$erence between shortand long-run elasticities and
show clearly that in the short run the Marshall–Lerner condition does not hold, though in the longer run it is
generally met (except in the cases of France and Germany).

A general consensus accepted by most economists is that elasticities are lower in the short run than in the

long run, in which case the Marshall–Lerner conditions may not hold in the short run but may hold in the

medium to long run. Goldstein and Kahn (1985) in an excellent survey of the empirical literature conclude

that, in general, long-run elasticities (greater than two years) are approximately twice as great as short-run

elasticities (0–6 months). Further, the short-run elasticities generally fail to sum to unity, while the long-run

elasticities almost always sum to greater than unity.

Te possibility that in the short run the Marshall–Lerner condition may not be ful!lled, although generally

holding over the longer run, leads to the phenomenon of what is popularly known as the J-curve e$etc, which

is illustrated in Figure 3.1.

studies. Individual studies give di$ering estimates depending on the time periods involved, the econometric methodology employed

and the particular data-set used.

Te idea underlying the J-curve e$ect is that in the short run export volumes and import volumes do

not change much so that the country receives less export revenue and spends more on imports, leading to a

deterioration in the current balance. However, a,er a time lag export volumes start to increase and import

volumes start to decline, and consequently the current de!cit starts to improve and eventually moves into

surplus. Te issue then is whether the initial deterioration in the current account is less than the future

improvement so that, overall, devaluation can be said to work. Krugman (1991), in an analysis of the e$ects of

**Figure 3.1** Te J-curve e$etc

a sharp depreciation of the US dollar during 1985–87, found a J-curve e$etc for the US current account: the

de!cit initially rose in both absolute terms and as a percentage of US gross national product, but a,er a lag

- f approximately two years it improved with long-run elasticities for imports and exports summing to 1.9 in
excess of that required by the Marshall–Lerner condition.

Tere have been numerous reasons advanced to explain the slow responsiveness of export and import

volumes in the short run and why the response is far greater in the longer run; three of the most important are:

 - **A time lag in consumer responses.** It takes time for consumers in both the devaluing country and the
rest of the world to respond to the changed competitive situation. Switching away from foreign imported
goods to domestically produced goods inevitably takes some time because consumers will be worried
about issues other than the price change, such as the reliability and reputation of domestically produced
goods as compared to the foreign imports. On the other hand, foreign consumers may be reluctant to
switch away from domestically produced goods towards the exports of the devaluing country.

 - **A time lag in producer responses.** Even though a devaluation improves the competitive position of
exports, it will take time for domestic producers to expand production of exportables. In addition,
the orders for imports are normally made well in advance and such contracts are not readily cancelled
in the short run. Factories will be reluctant to cancel orders for vital inputs and raw materials. For
example, the waiting list for a Boeing aeroplane can be over !ve years; it is most unlikely that a
British airline will cancel the order just because the pound has been devalued. Also, the payments for
many imports will have been hedged against exchange risk in the forward market and so will be le,
una$ected by the devaluation.

 - **Imperfect competition.** Building up a share of foreign markets can be a time-consuming and costly
business. Tis being the case, foreign exporters may be very reluctant to lose their market share
in the devaluing country and might respond to the loss in their competitiveness by reducing their
export prices. To the extent that they do this, the rise in the cost of imports caused by the devaluation

69

International Finance

will be partly o$set. Similarly, industries competing against foreign imports may react to the threat

    - f increased exports by the devaluing country by reducing prices in their home markets, limiting

the amount of additional exports by the devaluing country. Tese e$ects rely upon some degree of

imperfect competition which gives foreign !rms some super-normal pro!t margins enabling them

to reduce their prices. If foreign !rms were in a highly competitive environment they would only be

making normal pro!ts and so would be unable to reduce their prices.

In addition to the above e$ects it is unlikely that the price of exports as measured in the domestic prices will

remain !xed. Many imports are used as inputs for exporting industries and the increased price of imports may

lead to higher wage costs as workers seek compensation for higher import prices, which will to some extent

lead to a rise in export prices, reducing the competitive advantage of the devaluation.

3.4 THE PASS-THROUGH EFFECT OF A DEPRECIATION OR APPRECIATION

In the preceding analysis, we have assumed that a 10% depreciation/devaluation will lead to a rise in price of

imports by 10%. In the real world this might not be valid, and economists use the term 'pass-through e$ect’ to

describe the extent to which a 1% depreciation (appreciation) leads to a rise (fall) in import prices. If there is

complete pass-through, a 10% depreciation (appreciation) of the currency leads to a 10% rise (fall) in import

prices. If, however, a 10% depreciation (appreciation) leads to only a 6% rise (fall) in import prices, then there

is only a partial pass-through e$etc, with the elasticity of exchange rate pass-through being 0.6. Tere are

numerous reasons advanced as to why an _x_ % depreciation of the exchange rate may lead to a less than _x_ % rise

in prices in the short run. As noted previously, in a world of imperfect competition foreign !rms may not be

prepared to risk losing market share following a depreciation and decide to absorb part of the depreciation

by reducing their foreign currency price of exports so that the price rise following the devaluation will be less

than the _x_ % devaluation. Tis may be a sensible strategy since !rms may hesitate to risk losing market share

following what might be a temporary depreciation in the exchange rate. Similarly, if a currency appreciates,

foreign !rms may decide not to change their local currency prices since they will be able to increase their

pro!ts as measured in their local currency without having to invest to increase physical shipments to the

country for what might be only a transitory appreciation.

A paper by Yang (1997), who studied a selection of 77 manufacturing industries in the United States for

the period December 1980 until December 1991, found that the elasticity of pass-through was 0.3185 for one

quarter of a year, suggesting that a 10% depreciation of the dollar leads to a rise in import prices of 3.185%

- n average. However, there was quite a bit of dispersion between di$erent industries with the elasticity of
pass-through being only 0.025 in hardwood veneer and plywood and 0.757 in printing trade machinery.
As the time horizon increased, however, in all industries the elasticity of pass-through increased and o,en
approached unity. One of the key factors determining the elasticity of pass-through is the degree of product
di$erentiation: the greater that this is, then the greater is the ability of foreign exporters to raise their prices,
presumably because !rms in industries where the product is di$erentiated tend to face more price-inelastic
demand for their product and so are able to pass on price rises with less fear of losing sales. In a study by
Klitgaard (1999), looking at US imports from Japan in four major export industries (industrial machinery,
transportations equipment, electrical machinery and precision equipment) during the 1990s, it was found
that when the dollar depreciated by 10% then the price of Japanese imports rose by only 6%, suggesting that
Japanese exporters take a 4% o$setting change in their pro!t margin on exports in the short run.

To the extent that there is only a partial pass-through e$ect on the price of imports in the short run,

the e$etc will be to dampen the size and complicate the dynamics and timing of the J-curve e$etc. Tis is

70

Elasticity and Absorption Approaches to the Balance of Payments

because imports will not rise in price as much as suggested by the devaluation, which will tend to reduce

import expenditure compared to complete pass-through in the very short run. However, as the exchange rate

depreciation is increasingly passed on over time, this will tend to raise import expenditure, so prolonging the

initial deterioration of the J-curve.

3.5 THE ABSORPTION APPROACH

One of the major defects of the elasticity approach is that it is based upon the assumption that all other things

are equal. However, changes in export and import volumes will by de!nition have implications for national

income, and consequently income e$ects need to be incorporated in a more comprehensive analysis of the

e$ects of a devaluation. Alexander (1952) is one of the most important papers to evaluate this e$etc, focusing

- n the fact that a current account imbalance can be viewed as the di$erence between domestic output and
domestic spending (absorption).

Taking the equation for national income:

_Y_ = _C_ + _I_ + _G_ + _X_              - _M_ (3.10)

and de!ning domestic absorption as _A_ = _C_ + I + _G_, equation (3.10) can be rearranged as follows:

_CA_ = _X_             - _M_ = _Y_             - _A_ (3.11)

Equation (3.11) says that the current balance represents the di$erence between domestic output and domestic

absorption. A current account surplus means that domestic output exceeds domestic spending, while a

current account de!cit means that domestic output is less than domestic spending. Transforming equation

(3.11) into di$erence form yields:

d _CA_ = d _Y_                 - d _A_ (3.12)

What equation (3.12) implies is that the e$ects of a devaluation on the current balance will depend upon

how it a$ects national income relative to how it a$ects domestic absorption. If a devaluation raises domestic

income relative to domestic spending this current account improves. If, however, devaluation raises domestic

absorption relative to domestic income, the current account deteriorates. Understanding how devaluation

a$ects both income and absorption is therefore central to the absorption approach to balance of payments

analysis.

Absorption can be divided up into two parts: (i) a rise in income will lead to an increase in absorption

which is determined by the marginal propensity to absorb, denoted by _a_ ; (ii) there will also be a 'direct e$ect'

- n absorption, which is all the other e$ects on absorption resulting from devaluation, denoted by Ad. Tus the
change in total absorption d _A_, is given by:

d _A_                 - _a Y_ d                 - d _Ad_ (3.13)

Substituting (3.13) into equation (3.12) yields:

d _CA_                - (1 a� )d _Y_                - d _Ad_ (3.14)

Equation (3.14) reveals that there are three factors that need to be examined when considering the impact

- f devaluation. A devaluation can a$ect the current balance only by: changing the marginal propensity to
absorb, _a_ ; changing the level of income, d _Y_ ; and by a$ecting direct absorption, d _A_ d. Te condition for a
devaluation to improve the current account is (1 – _a_ )d _Y_ - d _A_ d, that is, any change in income not spent on
absorption must exceed any change in direct absorption.

To consider whether the above condition is likely to be ful!lled it is worth distinguishing two possible

states of an economy: below full employment, so that income may rise; and full employment, so that national

income cannot rise.

3.6 THE EFFECTS OF A DEVALUATION ON NATIONAL INCOME

Clearly a relevant question if the economy is at less than full employment is whether a devaluation is likely to

raise or lower national income. If the marginal propensity to absorb is less than unity then a rise in income will

raise the income to absorption ratio and so improve the current account. On the other hand, if income were

to fall this would raise the absorption to income ratio (as absorption would fall by less than income) which

would worsen the current account. Tere are two important e$ects on income that need to be examined: the

employment e$etc and the terms of trade e$etc:

 - **Employment effect.** If the economy is at less than full employment, then, providing the Marshall–
Lerner condition is ful!lled, there will be an increase in net exports following a devaluation which
will lead to an increase in national income via the foreign trade multiplier. However, if the Marshall–
Lerner condition is not ful!lled, then net exports would fall, implying that national income falls.
Hence, it is not clear whether the employment e$etc will raise or lower national income.

 - **Terms of trade effect.** Te terms of trade are the price of exports divided by the price of imports,
expressed algebraically as:

Price of exports

Price of imports [=] _[ P]_ _SP*_

where _P_ is the domestic price index, _P_ - is the foreign price index and _S_ is the exchange rate (domestic currency

units per unit of foreign currency).

A devaluation (a rise in _S_ ) tends to make imports more expensive in domestic currency terms, which

is not matched by a corresponding rise in export prices; this means that the terms of trade deteriorate.

A deterioration in the terms of trade represents a loss of real national income because more units of

exports have to be given to obtain a unit of imports. Hence, the terms of trade effect lowers national

income.

Overall, the e$ects of a devaluation on the income of the devaluing country are ambiguous. Even if there

are increased net exports earnings (which relies on the Marshall–Lerner condition being ful!lled) the negative

terms of trade e$etc works to reduce national income.

Even if income rises overall, it is still not clear what the implications of a rise in income are for the current

account, as this will depend upon the value of the marginal propensity to absorb. If this is less than unity then

an increase in income generated by the increase in net exports leads to an improvement in the current account

because income rises by more than absorption. If, however, the marginal propensity to absorb is greater than

72

Elasticity and Absorption Approaches to the Balance of Payments

unity then the increased income would lead to an even bigger rise in absorption, resulting in a worsening

- f the current account. Although one may think that the marginal propensity to absorb will be less than
unity this need not be the case. Alexander (1952) speculated that unemployed workers who obtain jobs are
likely to have a high propensity to consume and that an increase in income may well stimulate a great deal of
investment. Workers who obtain jobs may well decide to spend more than their income by borrowing against
future prospective income. Similarly, as the economy expands, !rms' expenditure may exceed their revenues
as they undertake signi!cant investment in the expectation of high future pro!ts. Hence, it is conceivable in
the short run that the marginal propensity to absorb could be greater than unity, so that a rise in income leads
to a deterioration in the current account.

Of course, if the economy is at a position of full employment, an increase in income is not possible. In this

instance, for a devaluation to improve the current de!cit, a reduction in direct absorption would be required.

But income changes are only one of the factors influencing the current account: the other e$etc that we need

to consider is the impact on direct absorption.

3.7 THE EFFECTS OF A DEVALUATION ON DIRECT ABSORPTION

For the moment, let us assume that the net e$ect of a devaluation on income is zero. Tis being the case, we

must consider the e$etc of the devaluation on direct absorption. If the devaluation reduces direct absorption,

then it will lead to an improvement in the current balance, whereas if it increases then the e$etc on the current

balance will lead to a deterioration of the current account. Let us now consider possible ways in which a

devaluation can be expected to impact upon direct absorption.

_Real balance effect_

A simple formulation of the demand to hold money is that it is a demand to hold real money balances.

If prices double then agents will demand twice as much money as before. Algebraically a money demand

function can be expressed as:

_M P_ / I [��] _[k]_ (3.15)

where _k_ is some constant and _P_ I is an aggregate price index de!ned as:

_P_ I [��]               - _P_               - (1 ��) _SP_               - (3.16)

where + is the percentage of expenditure on domestic goods, _P_ is the price of the domestic good, _P_ - is the price

- f the foreign import good, and _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign

currency.

For example, assume that the price of the domestic good, _P_, is £1, while the price of the foreign good, _P_ *,

is \$5, and the pre-devaluation exchange rate is £0.6667/\$1. If domestic consumers spend 70% of their money

- n domestic goods, + = 0.7, then the average price level is:

_P_ I�� 0.7 £1 0.3�            - �            - ��$5 £0.6667 /$1�            -            - �£1.70

73

International Finance

If the pound is devalued to £0.8/\$1 then the average price level becomes:

_P_ I             - 0.7 £1��             - ��0.3�� $5 £0.8 /$1�             - ���£1.90

Hence, a 20% devaluation of the pound will raise the average price index facing UK consumers by approximately

11.8%.

Given an unchanged money stock and the assumption that economic agents aim to maintain a given

amount of real money balances as depicted in equation (3.15), then a devaluation (rise in _S_ ) by raising the

- verall price index in equation (3.16) means that economic agents have to maintain their real balances by
cutting down on direct absorption. They will attempt to increase their money balances by selling bonds, which
pushes down the price of bonds and raises the domestic interest rate. Te rise in interest rates will reduce
investment and consumption, so reducing direct absorption.

For the real balance e$ect to come into play, it must be emphasized that the authorities must not

accommodate the increased money demand by increasing the money supply in line with the increased money

demand. If they raise the money supply, this would leave the ratio _M_ / _P_ I constant so that the real balance e$etc

will not come into play.

_Income redistribution effect_

Te rise in the general price index (equation 3.16) resulting from a devaluation is likely to have a number of

e$ects on the income distribution. To the extent that it redistributes income from those with a low marginal

propensity to absorb to those with a high marginal propensity to absorb, an increase in direct absorption will

follow. On the other hand, to the extent that the reverse is true, a lowering in direct absorption will follow. A

few possibilities in this respect are:

 - Te rise in the general price index will tend to reduce the real income of those with !xed incomes,
but if overall income is unchanged then those with variable incomes will have gained. It tends to be
the case that the group on !xed incomes are the poor who have a high propensity to absorb, while
those on variable incomes are better o$ and have a lower propensity to absorb. To the extent that
income is redistributed from those with !xed incomes to those with variable incomes, this income
redistribution e$etc will tend to reduce direct absorption.

 - A devaluation o,en leads to an improvement of company pro!ts through increased sales in exportand import-competing industries, while real wages are reduced by the rise in the aggregate price
index and take time to catch up. Te e$etc on direct absorption of this redistribution is not clear:
though !rms may have a lower tendency to absorb than workers, this will be very much dependent

	- n their expectations about the future. If these expectations are very favourable then the devaluation
and pro!ts rise may stimulate investment and even raise direct absorption.

 - Tere may be considerable income adjustments within groups of companies and workers. Some
companies' pro!ts will bene!t from a devaluation as export sales rise; however, some !rms that are
reliant on imported inputs may !nd that the cost increases reduce their pro!t margins. Similarly,
some workers will be able to protect themselves against the induced price rise because they are
represented by strong trade unions, while others with no union representation may not secure

74

Elasticity and Absorption Approaches to the Balance of Payments

compensating rises. Te overall e$etc on direct absorption will then depend on whether the

companies and workers that gain have a higher propensity to absorb than those that lose.

Overall, it is extremely difficult to say whether the income redistribution e$ects will raise or lower direct

absorption.

_Money illusion effect_

It is possible that, even though prices rise because of the devaluation, consumers su$er ‘money illusion’ and

buy exactly the same bundle of goods as before, even though their real spending power has been reduced. If

this is the case they are actually spending more on direct absorption than before. However, the money illusion

e$etc may work in reverse and consumers, because of the price rises, may actually decide to cut back direct

absorption more than is proportionate to the price rise so that direct absorption falls. Whichever way the

money illusion e$etc works it is unlikely to be very signi!cant and is most probably only a temporary rather

than a permanent factor.

_Expectational effects_

It is possible that economic agents regard the price rises induced by devaluation as likely to spark further

price rises. Tis would lead to an increase in direct absorption which would worsen the balance of payments.

However, against this it can be argued that inflationary expectations may reduce investment which lowers

direct absorption.

_Laursen–Metzler effect_

Laursen and Metzler (1950) noted that the deterioration in the terms of trade following a devaluation will

have two e$ects on absorption: an income e$etc and a substitution e$etc. While the deterioration in the terms

- f trade lowers national income and thereby income-related absorption, it also makes domestically produced
goods relatively cheaper compared to foreign produced goods, which implies a substitution e$etc in favour

- f increased consumption of domestically produced goods. If the positive substitution e$ect outweighs the
negative income e$etc, Laursen–Metzler noted that a devaluation which results in a deterioration of the terms

- f trade could actually lead to a rise in absorption.

Hence, the e$ects of a devaluation on direct absorption are ambiguous. While the real money balance

e$etc works to lower direct absorption, all the other e$ects may raise or lower direct absorption. Since we

do not know whether the marginal propensity to absorb is greater or less than unity, if income rises or falls,

nor whether direct absorption rises or falls, the e$ects of a devaluation are indeterminate. Indeed, the picture

will become much more complex once it is recognized that all the di$ering e$ects take place at di$erent

speeds over time and that some e$ects will be more signi!cant in certain economies than in others. Overall,

the approach suggests that a devaluation will have many diverse and o,en conflicting e$ects on the current

account.

Nonetheless, the absorption approach has some important lessons for policy-makers. Its central message

is that raising domestic income relative to domestic absorption will improve the current account balance. In

this respect, a devaluation is more likely to succeed if it is accompanied by economic policy measures that

concentrate on raising income while constraining absorption.

3.8 A SYNTHESIS OF THE ELASTICITY AND ABSORPTION APPROACHES

Initially, it was believed that the absorption approach was an alternative to the elasticities approach; the

elasticity approach concentrating on price e$ects while the absorption approach concentrated on income

e$ects. However, authors such as Tsiang (1961) and Alexander (1959) showed that the two models are not

substitutes; rather they are complementary.

To understand this complementarity, consider the e$ects of a devaluation on income. Exports will increase

more than imports, so raising income only if the Marshall–Lerner elasticities condition is ful!lled. If the

Marshall–Lerner condition is not ful!lled, then exports will rise by less than imports, implying that income

will fall. Hence, the Marshall–Lerner condition is clearly relevant to the absorption approach. Similarly,

when account is taken of income e$ects the necessary elasticity condition for a devaluation to improve the

current balance is a$ected. Tis is because if the elasticities sum to greater than unity, so that there is an initial

improvement in the current balance, this improvement leads to an increase in income which induces a larger

increase in imports than in the absence of such an income e$etc. For this reason, the initial improvement in

the current account has to be more pronounced than in the absence of such income e$ects. Tis implies that

the sum of elasticities needs to be somewhat greater than the unity value derived from the elasticity approach.

Tus, the absorption approach is relevant to the elasticity approach.

3.9 CONCLUSIONS

We have seen that the absorption approach, like the elasticity approach, does not provide an unambiguous

answer to the question of whether a devaluation leads to an improvement in the current account. At issue

is how economic agents respond to the change in relative prices that is implied by a devaluation. Te two

analyses are not alternative theories, but rather provide complementary insights into the processes at work.

Although the two models are comparatively static in nature, they both point to the importance of dynamic

forces and a time dimension to the eventual outcome. Demand elasticities are higher in the long run than in

the short run, leading to a possible J-curve e$ect and the e$ects of a devaluation on income and absorption

being spread over time. Even in these simple models, it is seen that there are likely to be a variety of forces at

work. No doubt even greater ambiguity would emerge as a result of including time lags, wealth e$ects and an

explicit treatment of expectations.

Despite their simplistic assumptions, ambiguous conclusions and de!ciencies, the two approaches have

remained influential because they contain clear and useful messages for policy-makers. A devaluation is more

likely to succeed when elasticities of demand for imports and exports are high and when it is accompanied by

measures such as !scal and monetary restraint that boost income relative to domestic absorption.

Te overwhelming weight of empirical estimates suggests that at time horizons of two years and above

the Marshall–Lerner conditions are ful!lled, implying that exchange rate adjustments are an influential tool

in eliminating current account de!cits. One should not expect a devaluation to work in the same manner

for all countries. Te e$ects of a devaluation will be determined in part by whether or not the economy

is at or below full employment and in part on the structural parameters of the particular economy under

consideration. Finally, it should be remembered that both models assume that foreign countries do not react

to the competitive advantage gained by the devaluing country. To the extent that they react by devaluing their

currencies, an undermining of the e$ectiveness of a devaluation policy will result.
