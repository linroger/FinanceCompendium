## 4.1 Introduction

In Chapter 3 we looked at some of the fundamental identities for an open economy and considered the

possible e$ect of devaluation on the current account. It was noted that the ultimate impact of a devaluation

will in large part be dependent upon the economic policies that accompany the devaluation. In this chapter

we shall be examining how both exchange rate changes and macroeconomic policies impact upon an open

economy. A fundamental di$erence between an open economy and a closed economy is that over time a

country has to ensure that there is an approximate balance in its current account. Tis is because no country

can continuously build up a stock of net liabilities to the rest of the world by running a continuous current

account de!cit. Conversely, it does not make sense for a surplus country to continuously build up a stock of

net claims on the rest of the world. Eventually it will wish to spend those claims.

Te need for economic policy-makers to pay attention to the implications of changes in monetary and !scal

policy on the balance of payments is an important additional dimension for consideration in the formulation

- f economic policy in an open economy. Ensuring a sustainable balance of payments position over time is an
important economic objective to go along with those like high economic growth, low unemployment and low
inflation.

One of the additional policy choices that has to be made by the authorities of an open economy is to decide

whether to !x the exchange rate, allow it to float or perhaps choose some arrangement between these two

extremes. Te choice between these two regimes is the focus of analysis in Chapter 10; in this chapter we

concentrate upon how !scal and monetary policy operate under both regimes.

## 4.2 The Problem of Internal and External Balance

To appreciate the development of the post-war literature on open economies, readers need to bear in mind

that between 1948 and 1973 the international monetary system was one of !xed exchange rates, with the

major currencies being pegged to the US dollar. Only in cases of 'fundamental disequilibrium' were authorities

allowed to devalue or revalue their currencies. Tis meant that there was considerable interest in the relative

e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policies as a means of influencing the economy. Although economic

policy-makers generally have many macroeconomic aims, the discussion in the 1950s and 1960s was primarily

concerned with two objectives. Te principal goal was one of achieving full employment for the labour force

along with a stable level of prices, which may be termed 'internal balance'. Although governments were

generally committed to achieving full employment it is widely recognized that expanding output in an open

economy will have implications for the balance of payments. For instance, expanding output and employment

will result in greater expenditure on imports and consequently lead to a deterioration of the current account.

As authorities had agreed to maintain !xed exchange rates, they were interested in running an equilibrium in

the balance of payments, that is, in balancing the supply and demand for their currency. Tis latter objective

can be termed external balance.

Changes in !scal and monetary policies which aim to influence the level of aggregate demand in the

economy are termed 'expenditure changing' policies. On the other hand, policies such as devaluation/

revaluation of the exchange rate, which attempt to influence the composition of spending between domestic

and foreign goods, are known as 'expenditure switching' policies.

Much of the 1950s and 1960s literature was concerned with how the authorities might simultaneously

achieve both internal and external balance. Te policy problem of achieving both internal and external

balance was conceptualized by Trevor Swan (1955) in what is known as the Swan diagram, which is illustrated

in Figure 4.1. On the vertical axis is the real exchange rate, de!ned as domestic currency units per unit

- f foreign currency, so that a rise represents a real depreciation, which implies improved international
competitiveness. On the horizontal axis we have the amount of real domestic absorption, which represents
the sum of consumption, investment and government expenditure.

Te internal balance (IB) schedule represents combinations of the real exchange rate and domestic

absorption for which the economy is in internal balance, that is, full employment with stable prices. It is

downward-sloping from le, to right. Tis is because an appreciation (fall) of the real exchange rate will

reduce exports and increase imports; therefore to maintain full employment it is necessary for there to be

an increase in domestic expenditure. To the right of the IB schedule there are inflationary pressures in the

economy because for a given exchange rate domestic expenditure is greater than that required to produce full

employment, while to the le, there are deflationary pressures because expenditure is short of that required to

maintain full employment.

Te external balance (EB) schedule shows combinations of the real exchange rate and domestic absorption

for which the economy is in external balance, that is, equilibrium in the current account. It is upward-sloping

from le, to right. Tis is because a depreciation of the exchange rate will increase exports and reduce imports;

so to prevent the current account moving into surplus requires increased domestic expenditure to induce

an o$setting increase in imports. To the right of the EB schedule domestic expenditure is greater than that

required for current account equilibrium, so the result is a current account de!cit, while to the le, there is a

current account surplus.

Hence, the Swan diagram is divided into four zones depicting di$erent possible states for an economy:

 Zone 1: a de!cit and inflationary pressures;

 Zone 2: a de!cit and deflationary pressures;

 Zone 3: a surplus and deflationary pressures;

 Zone 4: a surplus and inflationary pressures.

Only at point A, where the IB and EB schedules intersect, is the economy in both internal and external

equilibrium. Suppose that the economy for some reason !nds itself at point B in zone 1, experiencing both

inflationary pressures and a current account de!cit. If the authorities maintain a !xed exchange rate and

try to reduce the current account de!cit by cutting back real domestic expenditure they will move the

economy towards point C; while to achieve external balance by using expenditure-reducing policies alone

would require such a cut-back in absorption that the economy would su$er and be pushed into recession

with resulting unemployment. Alternatively, the authorities might try to tackle the de!cit by devaluing the

exchange rate, which has the e$etc of moving the economy towards point D on the EB schedule. While the

devaluation has the e$etc of reducing the current account de!cit it does so at the expense of adding further

inflationary pressures to the economy. Tis is shown by the fact that the economy moves further away from

the IB schedule.

A major lesson of this simple model is that the use of one instrument, be it !scal policy or devaluation,

to achieve two targets, internal and external balance, is most unlikely to be successful. To move from point

79

International Finance

B to point A, the authorities need to both deflate the economy and undertake a devaluation by appropriate

amounts. Te deflation combined with a devaluation will control inflation and improve the current account

so that the two objectives can be met. Te idea that a country generally requires as many instruments as it has

targets was elaborated by the Nobel Prize-winning Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen (1952), and is popularly

known as Tinbergen's instruments–targets rule.

While the Swan diagram provides a useful conceptual framework for economic policy discussion, it is

rather simplistic in that the underlying economic relationships are not explicitly de!ned. Furthermore,

there is no role for international capital movements that were an increasingly important feature of the postSecond World War international economy. In addition, there is no distinction made between monetary and

!scal policies as separate means of influencing aggregate demand and output in the economy. Te so-called

Mundell–Fleming model to which we now turn attempts to integrate such features into a formal openeconomy macroeconomic model.

## 4.3 The Mundell–Fleming Model

Tis model owes its origins to papers published by James Fleming (1962) and Robert Mundell (1962 and 1963).

Teir major contribution was to incorporate international capital movements into formal macroeconomic

models based on the Keynesian IS–LM framework. Teir papers led to some dramatic implications concerning

the e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policy for the attainment of internal and external balance. We shall

now examine the main implications of the Keynesian model and the results of Fleming's and Mundell's papers

by using what is known as IS-LM-BP analysis (investment–savings, liquidity preference–money and balance

- f payments). Firstly, we derive the IS, LM and BP schedules that provide the framework for the analysis.

## 4.4 Derivation of the IS Schedule for an Open Economy

Te IS curve for an open economy shows various combinations of the level of output ( _Y_ ) and the rate of interest

that make leakages, that is, savings and import expenditure ( _S_ + _M_ ), equal to injections, that is, investment,

government expenditure and exports ( _I_ + _G_ + _X_ ). In an open economy we have the identity:

_Y_ = _C_ + _I_ + _G_ + _X_              - _M_ (4.1)

where _Y_ is the national income, _C_ is domestic consumption, _I_ is domestic investment, _G_ is government

expenditure, _X_ is export expenditure and _M_ is import expenditure.

Tis identity can be restated in terms of equality between leakages and injections. Since _Y_  - _C_ = _S_, where _S_

is savings, we can rewrite equation (4.1) as:

_S_ + _M_ = _I_ + _G_ + _X_ (4.2)

For simplicity the following linear relationships are assumed:

_S_ = _Sa_ + _sY_ (4.3)

80

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

Here, savings _S_ are equal to autonomous savings ( _Sa_ ) plus savings which are a positive function of income,

where _s_ is the marginal propensity to save.

_M_ = _Ma_ + _mY_ (4.4)

Imports _M_ are equal to autonomous imports ( _Ma_ ) plus imports which are a positive function of increases

in income, where _m_ is the marginal propensity to import.

_I_ = _I_ ( _r_ ) d _I_ /d _r_ < 0 (4.5)

Equation (4.5) says that investment is assumed to be an inverse function of the rate of interest. As far as

government expenditure and exports are concerned these are assumed to be autonomous with respect to the

rate of interest and level of national income. Te relationships above are illustrated in Figure 4.2.

Quadrant (1) depicts the relationship between leakages and income; it is an upward-sloping line because

increases in income lead to increased savings and imports, and the slope of the line is given by ( _s_ + _m_ )/1. At income

level _Y_ 1, the corresponding level of leakages is given by _L_ 1, and likewise at income level _Y_ 2 the corresponding level

- f leakages is given by _L_ 2. Te resulting volume of leakages is transferred to quadrant (2), which has a 45-degree
line that converts any distance along the vertical axis to an equivalent distance on the horizontal axis which
measures injections. Hence, the leakages _L_ 1 are converted into an equivalent amount of injection _In_ 1.

Te injections schedule is depicted in quadrant (3) which shows that given the price level and state of

expectations the rate of interest that leads to a level of injections _In_ 1 is given by _r_ 1. Te injections schedule is

downward-sloping from le, to right because investment is inversely related to the rate of interest, while the

level of government expenditure and exports are assumed to be independent of the rate of interest.

We now know that the income level _Y_ 1 generates leakages _L_ 1 which will be equal to injections _In_ 1 if the

interest rate is _r_ 1. Tis means that in quadrant (4) we can depict a point on the IS curve for an open economy

because at interest rate _r_ 1 and income level _Y_ 1 we know that leakages are equal to injections. We can repeat the

same process for the income level _Y_ 2 to obtain the rate of interest _r_ 2 for which leakages are equal to injections.

By repeating the process we can obtain a large number of income and interest rate levels for which leakages

are equal to injections. By joining up these points we obtain the IS curve for an open economy. As can be seen

in quadrant (4), the IS curve is downward-sloping from le, to right in the interest rate/income level space.

Tis is because higher levels of income generate higher levels of leakages requiring a fall in the interest rate to

generate increased investment and maintain equality of injections and leakages.

## 4.5 Derivation of the LM Schedule for an Open Economy

Te LM schedule shows various combinations of the level of income and rate of interest for which the money

market is in equilibrium; that is, for which money demand equals money supply. In the simpli!ed model, we

assume that money is demanded for only two reasons: transactions purposes and speculative purposes. With

the transactions motive people hold money because there is not normally a synchronization between their

receipt and expenditure of money. In general it is postulated that the higher an individual's income the larger

the amount of money that is held for transactions purposes. Tis is based on the presumption that the higher

- ne's income the greater one's payments and correspondingly the greater the desired holdings of money for
transaction purposes. As such, the transactions demand for money is assumed to be a positive function of
income. Tis is expressed algebraically as:

_Mt_ = _Mt_ ( _Y_ ) (4.6)

where _Mt_ is the transactions demand for money.

Te other reason for holding money is the speculative motive. It is assumed that any money balances

held in excess of those required for transactions purposes are speculative balances. If the rate of interest rises

then so does the opportunity cost of holding money. For instance, if the rate of interest is 5% per annum the

- pportunity cost of £100 is £5 per annum, but if the interest rate is 10% the opportunity cost is £10 per annum
and consequently the demand to hold speculative balances will fall as the rate of interest rises. Tis inverse
relationship between the demand for speculative balances and the rate of interest is expressed algebraically as:

_M_ = _M_ ( _r_ ) (4.7)

_sp_ _sp_

where _Msp_ is the speculative demand for money.

82

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

In equilibrium, the money demand ( _Md_ ) made up of transactions and speculative balances is equal to the

money supply ( _Ms_ ). Tis is expressed algebraically as:

_Md_ = _Msp_ + _Mt_ = _Ms_ (4.8)

Te derivation of the LM curve is illustrated in Figure 4.3. Quadrant (1) depicts the transactions demand

for money as a positive function of income. As income rises from _Y_ 1 to _Y_ 2, the demand for transaction

balances rises from _Mt_ 1 to _Mt_ 2. Te transactions balance !gure is transferred to quadrant (2) which shows

the distribution of the !xed money supply between transaction and speculative balances. Te distance 0a

represents the total money supply, so that if _Mt_ 1 is held for transaction purposes, then 0a minus _Mt_ 1 which is

equal to _Msp_ 1 is held as speculative balances. Quadrant (3) shows the speculative demand for money schedule

which is downward-sloping from le, to right because the demand for speculative balances is inversely related

to the rate of interest. Te schedule reveals that speculative balances _Msp_ 1 are only willingly held at the interest

rate _r_ 1. We now have enough information to plot a point on the LM schedule; this is done in quadrant (4)

which shows that at interest rate _r_ 1 and income level _Y_ 1 the demand for speculative and transaction balances

is equal to the money supply.

By taking another income level _Y_ 2 we can by a similar process !nd a rate of interest _r_ 2 which is compatible

with money-market equilibrium. Other such derivations can be done, and by joining them together we

- btain the LM schedule. Te LM schedule is upward-sloping from le, to right. Tis is because high income
levels require relatively large transaction balances which for a given money supply can only be drawn out of
speculative balances by a relatively high interest rate.

## 4.6 Derivation of the BP Schedule for an Open Economy

Te balance of payments schedule shows di$erent combinations of rates of interest and income that are

compatible with equilibrium in the balance of payments. When referring to the balance of payments we divide

it up into two sections: the current account and the capital account. Exports are assumed to be independent

- f the level of national income and the rate of interest, but imports are assumed to be positively related to
income, expressed algebraically as:

_M_ = _Ma_ + _mY_ (4.9)

Total imports ( _M_ ) are a function of autonomous imports ( _M_ a) and the level of income, where _m_ is the marginal

propensity to import.

We now need to remind ourselves of the constituent parts of the balance of payments. As we saw in Chapter

2, the overall balance of payments is made up of three major components: the current account ( _CA_ ), the

capital account ( _K_ ) and the change in the authorities reserves (d _R_ ). By maintaining balance in the supply and

demand for the currency – that is, external balance – we mean that there is no need for the authorities to have

to change their holdings of foreign exchange reserves. Tis implies that if there is a current account de!cit

there needs to be an o$setting surplus in the capital account so that the authorities do not have to change their

reserves. Conversely, if there is a current account surplus there needs to be an o$setting de!cit in the capital

account to have equilibrium in the balance of payments.

Since exports are determined exogenously and imports are a positive function of income, the higher the

level of national income the smaller will be any current account surplus or the larger any current account

de!cit. Te net capital flow ( _K_ ) is a positive function of the domestic interest rate. Assuming that the rate of

### ®

interest in the rest of the world ( _r_ *) is !xed, the higher the domestic interest rate the greater the capital inflow

into the country, or the smaller any capital outflow. Tis relationship is expressed algebraically as:

_K_ = _K_ ( _r_                     - _r_ *) (4.10)

Since the balance of payments schedule shows various combinations of levels of income, and the rate of

interest for which the balance of payments is in equilibrium, then:

_X_                    - _M_ + _K_ = 0 (4.11)

A positive _K_ indicates a net inflow of funds, whereas a negative _K_ indicates a net outflow of funds.

Te derivation of the BP schedule is illustrated in Figure 4.4. Quadrant (1) shows the relationship between

the current account and level of national income. Te current balance schedule slopes downwards from le,

to right because increases in income lead to a deterioration of the current account. At income level _Y_ 1 there

is a current account surplus of _CA_ 1, whereas at income level _Y_ 2 there is a current account de!cit of _CA_ 2. Te

**Figure 4.4** Derivation of the BP schedule

current account surplus or de!cit is transferred to quadrant (2) where the 45-degree line converts the current

_CA_ there is a

account position to an equal capital flow of the opposite sign. With a current account surplus 1

required capital outflow _K_ 1 to ensure balance of payments equilibrium, while a current account de!cit _CA_ 2

_K_

requires a capital inflow 2. Quadrant (3) shows the rate of interest that is required for a given capital flow. Te

capital flow schedule is downward-sloping from le, to right because high interest rates encourage a net capital

inflow, whereas low interest rates encourage a net capital outflow. To get a capital outflow of _K_ 1 requires the

interest rate to be _r_ 1, while a capital inflow of _K_ 2 requires a higher interest rate _r_ 2.

Since income level _Y_ 1 is associated with a balance of payments surplus, there has to be an o$setting capital

- utflow _K_ 1 which requires an interest rate _r_ 1; these coordinates give a point on the BP schedule that is depicted
in quadrant (4). Te BP schedule is upward-sloping because higher levels of income cause a deterioration in
the current account, which necessitates a reduced capital outflow/higher capital inflow requiring a higher

85

International Finance

interest rate. Every point on the BP schedule shows a combination of domestic income and rate of interest for

which the overall balance of payments is in equilibrium. At points to the le, of the BP schedule the overall

balance of payments is in surplus because for a given amount of capital flows the current account is better

than that required for equilibrium as the level of income is lower. Conversely, to the right of the BP schedule

the overall balance of payments is in de!cit as the income level is higher than that compatible with overall

equilibrium.

At this point it is worth noting that the slope of the BP schedule is determined by the degree of capital

mobility internationally: the higher the degree of capital mobility then the flatter the BP schedule. Tis is

because for a given increase in income which leads to a deterioration of the current account, the higher the

degree of capital mobility the smaller the required rise in the domestic interest rate to attract sufficient capital

inflows to ensure overall equilibrium. When capital is perfectly mobile, the slightest rise in the domestic

interest rate above the world interest rate leads to a massive capital inflow making the BP schedule horizontal

at the world interest rate. At the other extreme, if capital is perfectly immobile internationally then a rise in

the domestic interest will fail to attract capital inflows, making the BP schedule vertical at the income level

that ensures current account balance. Between these two extremes, that is, when we have an upward-sloping

BP schedule, we say that capital is imperfectly mobile.

## 4.7 Equilibrium of the Model

Figure 4.5 depicts all three schedules intersecting through a common point. Te BP schedule is steeper than

the LM schedule, but this need not always be the case. As we shall see later, changing the relative slope of the

two schedules can lead to somewhat di$erent policy prescriptions. All three schedules pass through a common

point A which corresponds to the domestic interest rate _r_ 1 and income level _Y_ 1. Te income level _Y_ 1 is seen

to be less than that of the full employment level of income _Y_ F, implying that there is some unemployment in

the economy. Although the economy is not in internal equilibrium, the balance of payments is in equilibrium

because the IS and LM schedules intersect at a point on the BP schedule.

Te explanation as to why the IS–LM schedules do not intersect at the full employment level of income _Y_ F

is that at _Y_ F planned leakages (savings and import expenditure) would exceed planned injections (government

expenditure, exports and investment). Tis would imply a build-up of stocks of unsold goods leading

producers to reduce output. Only at output level _Y_ 1 do planned leakages equal planned injections so that

changes in stocks are avoided.

Figure 4.6 illustrates scenarios where there is a surplus or de!cit in the balance of payments. In Figure%4.6(a),

because the IS and LM schedules intersect to the le, of the BP schedule, there is a balance of payments

surplus. Tis surplus comes about because the level of income is too low and/or the rate of interest is too high

to be compatible with overall equilibrium. In Figure 4.6(b) there is a balance of payments de!cit because the

IS and LM schedules intersect to the right of the BP schedule, which means that the income level _Y_ 2 is too high

and/or the interest rate _r_ 2 is too low, inducing an overall balance of payments de!cit.

## 4.8 Factors Shifting the IS–LM–BP Schedules

In the analysis of the rest of this chapter we need to consider how changes in the exchange rate and monetary

and !scal policies a$etc the position of the various schedules.

_Factors shifting the IS schedule_

Te IS schedule will shi, to the right if there is an increase in either investment, government expenditure or

exports. Tis is because an increase in these injections requires a higher level of national income to induce a

matching increase in leakages in the form of increased savings and imports. An autonomous fall in savings or

imports will also require a rightward shi, of the IS schedule because a higher level of income is required to

induce more savings and import expenditure so as to maintain equality of leakages and injections. Another

87

International Finance

important factor that causes a rightward shi, of the IS schedule is a depreciation or devaluation of the

exchange rate, providing that the Marshall–Lerner condition holds; this is because a depreciation (rise) in the

exchange rate leads to a reduction of import expenditure and an increase in export sales so that injections then

exceed leakages, requiring an increased level of income to bring them back into equality.

_Factors shifting the LM schedule_

Te LM schedule will shi, to the right if there is an increase in the domestic money supply because, for a given

rate of interest, the increased supply will only be willingly held if there is an increase in income which leads

to a rise in the transactions demand for money. A depreciation of the exchange rate will lead to a rise in the

aggregate price index, that is, an index made up of a weighted basket of domestic and foreign imported goods

(see equation 3.16), because it implies a rise in the price of imports. Tis means that real money balances will

be reduced and there will be a resulting increase in the demand for money that can only be eliminated by

reducing the transactions demand for money, implying a lower level of income and a le,ward shi, of the LM

schedule.

_Factors shifting the BP schedule_

An autonomous increase in exports or an autonomous decrease in imports will lead to an improvement in

the current account requiring a rightward shi, of the BP schedule to induce a sufficient increase in imports to

maintain balance of payments equilibrium. Another factor that can cause a rightward shi, of the BP schedule

is a depreciation/devaluation of the exchange rate, providing the Marshall–Lerner condition holds; this leads

to the value of export sales rising and the value of import expenditure declining. Hence, the only way to ensure

- verall balance of payments equilibrium is a rise in the level of domestic income.

Bearing in mind these shi, factors we will proceed to look at how this toolkit can be usefully applied to

some key issues in the realm of open-economy macroeconomic policy.

## 4.9 Internal and External Balance

Te Swan diagram shows that authorities generally need as many instruments as they have targets and reveals

that the use of both expenditure-switching and expenditure-changing policies can lead to the attainment of

internal and external balance. However, it was not possible to distinguish between the fact that !scal and

monetary policies are quite di$erent and independent types of expenditure-changing policies. Tis begs

the question as to whether it is feasible to achieve the twin objectives of internal and external balance by

combining !scal and monetary policies without the need to adjust the exchange rate?

Before attempting to answer this question we need to consider how monetary and !scal policy may be

used as policy instruments for achieving internal and external balance, and to consider how the two policies

influence economic activity.

_Monetary policy_

When the authorities conduct an expansionary monetary policy they purchase bonds from the public, which

pushes up the price of bonds, expands the money supply and leads to a fall in the domestic interest rate.

Te fall in the domestic interest rate will stimulate investment and so lead to a rise in output. As far as the

88

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

balance of payments is concerned, the increased income leads to a deterioration of the current account and

the lower interest rate will lead to increased capital outflows so that the balance of payments moves into

de!cit. Conversely, a contractionary monetary policy involves the authorities selling bonds, which pushes

down the price of bonds, reduces the money supply and leads to a rise in the domestic interest rate. Te rise

in the interest rate leads to less investment and a fall in output. Te balance of payments position will improve

as imports fall and the higher interest rate attracts capital inflows.

_Fiscal policy_

With an expansionary !scal policy, the government increases its expenditure; with pure !scal policy it

!nances this increased expenditure by selling bonds. Te increased expenditure shi,s the IS schedule to the

right through the government expenditure multiplier e$ect examined in Chapter 3. However, the bond sales

will depress the price of bonds thereby raising the domestic interest rate which will partially o$set expansion

in output. Te precise e$ect of the !scal expansion on the balance of payments is indeterminate because,

while the expansion of output will worsen the current account, the rise in interest rates will improve the

capital account. Te converse reasoning holds for a contractionary !scal policy. Te money supply is not

a$ected by the expansionary !scal policy since the money raised by bond sales is used to !nance the increased

government expenditure.

_Sterilized and non-sterilized intervention_

One other policy which we need to clarify is the distinction between sterilized and non-sterilized intervention

in the foreign exchange market. With sterilized intervention the authorities o$set the money-base implications

- f their exchange market interventions to ensure that the changes in reserves due to intervention do not
a$ect the domestic money base, whereas with a policy of non-sterilized intervention the authorities allow the
reserve changes resulting from their interventions to a$etc the monetary base.

Te distinction between sterilized and non-sterilized intervention by an example of what happens if

there is a monetary expansion under !xed exchange rates is depicted in Figure 4.7. A monetary expansion

shi,s the LM schedule to the right from LM1 to LM2. Tis causes a fall in the interest rate to _r_ 2 and a rise in

domestic income to _Y_ 2; the result is a balance of payments de!cit as both the current and capital accounts

deteriorate. Te de!cit means that there is an excess supply of the currency on the foreign exchange

market and to maintain a !xed exchange rate the authorities have to purchase the home currency with

reserves.

Ordinarily, the purchases of the home currency by the authorities would start to shi, the LM schedule back

to the le, from LM2 towards LM1. Tis is an example of non-sterilized intervention, that is, the authorities

allow their interventions in the foreign exchange market to influence the money supply. However, if the

authorities pursue a policy of sterilization of reserve changes, the reserve falls which reduce the money supply

are exactly o$set by a further expansion of the money supply so that the LM schedule remains at point LM2. A

clear problem with a sterilization policy is that, by remaining at LM2 with interest rate _r_ 2 and income level _Y_ 2,

the authorities will su$er a continuous balance of payments de!cit and a continuous fall in reserves. Such a

sterilization policy is only feasible in the short run because over the longer run reserves would eventually run

- ut, making a devaluation inevitable.

We are now in a position to examine how !scal and monetary policy and exchange rate policy can be

variously combined to simultaneously achieve both internal and external balance.

## 4.10 Internal and External Balance under Fixed Exchange Rates

A situation of !xed exchange rates and unemployment is depicted in Figure 4.8. Te economy is assumed

to be at point A with interest rate _r_ 1 and income level _Y_ 1, which means that while the economy is in external

balance the income level is below the full employment level of income _Y_ F.

Te government attempts to eradicate the unemployment via a bond-!nanced !scal expansion, which

shi,s the IS schedule to the right from IS1 to IS2. Domestic output expands from _Y_ 1 to _Y_ 2 and the economy

would be at point B with interest rate _r_ 2. In raising the level of output beyond the full employment level we

!nd that the induced increase in imports moves the current account into de!cit, and although the rise in

the interest rate attracts some capital inflow the balance of payments is in overall de!cit since the economy

is to the right of the BP schedule. Te authorities are forced to purchase the home currency in the foreign

exchange market, but because they pursue a sterilization policy the LM schedule remains at LM1. Hence, using

- nly a single policy instrument, in this case !scal policy, the government can temporarily achieve its internal
- bjective at the expense of a sacri!ce in the objective of external balance.

Ideally, however, the authorities would like to achieve both internal and external balance. Tis is possible

if they combine the expansionary !scal policy – IS1 to IS2 – with a contractionary monetary policy which

shi,s the LM schedule from LM1 to LM2 where it passes through point C on the BP schedule. Te restrictive

monetary policy raises interest rates further than in the case of a solely !scal expansion to _r_ 3, and in so doing

**Figure 4.8** Internal and external balance under a !xed exchange rate

attracts additional capital inflows so as to restore the balance of payments back to equilibrium. Hence, by

combining an expansionary !scal policy with a contractionary monetary policy the authorities can achieve

both internal and external balance. An important lesson from this example is that the authorities can achieve

both internal and external balance without the need to change the exchange rate; this is because they have two

independent instruments, monetary and !scal policy, and two targets.

## 4.11 Internal and External Balance under Floating Exchange Rates

According to our analysis of the Swan diagram, by combining an exchange rate change with an expenditurechanging policy it is possible to achieve both internal and external balance. An interesting issue that we can

explore within the framework of our model is what are the likely di$erences of achieving internal and external

balance by combining exchange rate changes with monetary policy as opposed to doing so by combining

exchange rate changes with !scal policy. To examine this issue we !rst consider the case of combining

exchange rate adjustments with monetary policy, and then examine the implications of combining exchange

rate adjustment with !scal policy.

Figure 4.9 considers the case of monetary expansion under floating exchange rates. Initial equilibrium is

at point A with interest rate _r_ 1 and output level _Y_ 1. Te authorities adopt an expansionary monetary policy

and this shi,s the LM schedule from LM to LM . Te combination of a fall in the interest rate and increase in

income leads to a balance of payments de!cit at point B. However, the exchange rate is allowed to depreciate

and this leads to a rightward shi, of the IS schedule from IS1 to IS2, and a rightward shi, of the BP schedule

from BP1 to BP2. However, it also leads to a le,ward shi, of the LM schedule until all three schedules intersect

at a common point such as C, with new income level _Y_ 2 and interest rate _r_ 2. Hence, by using monetary policy

in conjunction with exchange rate changes, it is possible to raise real output to the full employment level and

achieve external balance simultaneously.

Overall, the money-supply expansion results in an exchange rate depreciation, a fall in the domestic

interest rate and an increase in income. Te lower interest rate implies a lower capital inflow/higher capital

- utflow than before the money supply expansion, while the increase in income worsens the current account.
Tis implies that the depreciation improves the current account to exactly o$set the preceding e$ects.

_Fiscal expansion under floating exchange rates_

Te e$ects of a !scal expansion on the exchange rate under floating rates depend crucially upon the slope of

the BP schedule relative to the LM schedule. We shall consider two cases: in case 1 the BP schedule is steeper

than the LM schedule, while in case 2 the reverse is true.

In Figure 4.10 the BP schedule is steeper than the LM schedule, which means that capital flows are relatively

insensitive to interest rate changes, while money demand is fairly elastic with respect to the interest rate. An

expansionary !scal policy shi,s the IS schedule from IS1 to IS2. Te induced rise of the domestic interest rate

and domestic income has opposing e$ects on the balance of payments: the expansion in real output leads to

a deterioration of the current account, but the rise in the interest rate improves the capital account. However,

because capital flows are relatively immobile the former e$ect outweighs the latter, so the balance of payments

moves into de!cit. In turn, the de!cit leads to a depreciation of the exchange rate, which has the e$etc of

shi,ing the BP schedule to the right from BP1 to BP2, the LM schedule to the le, from LM1 to LM2, and the IS

schedule even further to the right from IS2 to IS3. Final equilibrium is obtained at point C, with interest rate _r_ 2

and income level _Y_ 2. Hence, the deterioration in the balance of payments resulting from the rise in real income

is o$set by a combination of a higher interest rate and an exchange rate depreciation.

In Figure 4.11 an expansionary !scal policy shi,s the IS schedule from IS1 to IS2. In this case, because

capital flows are much more responsive to changes in interest rates, the BP schedule is less steep than the LM

schedule. Te increased capital inflow more than o$sets the deterioration in the current account due to the

increase in income, and the balance of payments moves into surplus. Te surplus induces an appreciation of

the exchange rate, which moves the LM schedule to the right from LM1 to LM2, the BP schedule to the le,

from BP1 to BP2, and the IS schedule to the le, from IS2 to IS3. Equilibrium is obtained at a higher level of

- output, higher interest rate and an exchange rate appreciation.

Hence a !scal expansion can, according to the degree of international capital mobility, lead to either an

exchange rate depreciation or an exchange rate appreciation.

## 4.12 A Small Open Economy with Perfect Capital Mobility

One prominent feature of the post-Second World War international monetary system has been the increasing

integration of international capital markets. Tere has been a great deal of discussion about the desirability

- f these capital flows and how they might threaten the ability of authorities to conduct e$ective economic

**Figure 4.11** Case 2: A !scal expansion under floating exchange rates

policies. In classic papers, Mundell (1962) and Fleming (1962) sought to examine the implications of high

capital mobility for a small country that had no ability to influence world interest rates. Teir papers showed

that for such a country, the choice of exchange rate regime would have radical implications concerning the

e$ectiveness of monetary and !scal policy in influencing the level of economic activity.

Te model assumes a small country facing perfect capital mobility. Any attempt to raise the domestic

interest rate leads to a massive capital inflow to purchase domestic bonds, pushing up the price of bonds until

the interest rate returns to the world interest rate. Conversely, any attempt to lower the domestic interest rate

leads to a massive capital outflow as international investors seek higher world interest rates. Such massive

bond sales mean that the domestic interest rate immediately returns to the world interest rate so as to stop the

capital outflow. Te implication of perfect capital mobility is that the BP schedule for a small open economy

becomes a horizontal straight line at a domestic interest rate that is the same as the world interest rate.

Figure 4.12 depicts a small open economy with a !xed exchange rate. Te initial level of income is where

the IS–LM curves intersect at the income level _Y_ 1, which is below the full employment level of income _Y_ F. If

the authorities attempt to raise output by a monetary expansion the LM schedule shi,s to the right from LM1

to LM

2. Tere is downward pressure on the domestic interest rate and this results in a massive capital outflow.

Tis capital outflow means that there is pressure for a devaluation of the currency: the authorities have to

intervene in the foreign exchange market to purchase the home currency with reserves. Such purchases result

in a reduction of the money supply in the hands of private agents. Te purchases have to continue until

the LM curve shi,s back to its original position at LM1 where the domestic interest rate is restored to the

world interest rate. With perfect capital mobility, any attempt to pursue a sterilization policy leads to such

large reserve losses that it cannot be pursued. Hence, with perfect capital mobility and !xed exchange rates,

monetary policy is ine$ective at influencing output.

**Figure 4.12** Fixed exchange rates and perfect capital mobility

By contrast, if there is a !scal expansion this shi,s the IS schedule to the right from IS1 to IS2, which puts

upward pressure on the domestic interest rate and leads to a massive capital inflow. To prevent an appreciation

the authorities have to purchase the foreign currency with the domestic currency. Tis means that the amount

- f domestic currency held by private agents increases and the LM1 schedule shi,s to the right from LM1 to LM2.
Te increase in the money stock continues until the LM schedule passes through the IS2 schedule at the initial
interest rate and output level YF. Hence, under !xed exchange rates and perfect capital mobility, an active !scal
policy alone has the ability to achieve both internal and external balance. Tis is an exception to the instruments–
targets rule, although monetary policy does have to adjust passively to maintain the !xed exchange rate.

In Figure 4.13 initial equilibrium is at the income level _Y_ 1 where the IS1 schedule intersects the LM1 schedule.

to LM

In this case, we have a floating exchange rate. A monetary expansion shi,s the LM schedule from LM1 2

leading to downward pressure on the interest rate, a capital outflow and a depreciation of the exchange rate.

Te depreciation leads to an increase in exports and reduction in imports, thus shi,ing the IS curve to the

right and the LM schedule to the le,, so that !nal equilibrium is obtained at a higher level of income, say _Y_ 2.

Clearly with an appropriate initial monetary expansion the authorities could obtain both internal and external

balance by monetary policy alone.

Suppose, instead, the authorities attempt to expand output by an expansionary !scal policy. Te increased

government expenditure shi,s the IS schedule to the right from IS1 to IS2, but the bond sales that !nance the

**Figure 4.13** Floating exchange rates and perfect capital mobility

expansion lead to upward pressure on the domestic interest rate, resulting in a massive capital inflow and

an appreciation of the exchange rate. Te appreciation of the exchange rate results in a reduction of exports

and an increase in imports, which forces the IS schedule back to its original position. Hence, with floating

exchange rates and perfect capital mobility !scal policy is ine$ective at influencing real output.

By contrast, a monetary expansion that shi,s the LM schedule from LM1 to LM2 leads to a fall in the

domestic interest rate and a depreciation of the exchange rate. Tis depreciation then leads to an increase in

exports and a reduction in imports that shi,s the IS schedule to the right from IS1 to IS2 and some reduction

- f the real money stock, shi,ing LM2 to the le, to, say, LM3, so that overall income rises to _Y_ 2. In this instance,
it is monetary policy alone which can achieve both internal and external balance, although the exchange rate
adjusts passively to the change in the money stock.

Te contrast between the e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policy with perfect capital mobility under

di$erent exchange rate regimes is one of the most famous results in international economics. Monetary policy

is ine$ective at influencing output under !xed exchange rates, while it alone can influence output under

floating exchange rates. By contrast, !scal policy alone is e$ective at influencing output under a !xed exchange

rate, while it is ine$ective under floating exchange rates.

  - ther possible combination is goals 2 and 3, which is the case when a country permits free movement
  - f capital whilst maintaining a !xed exchange rate. A good example of this is Hong Kong which pegs
the Hong Kong dollar rigidly to the US dollar and allows free movement of capital into and out of the
country. Te price, however, is that it gives up its monetary independence; if the Federal Reserve of the
United States raises dollar interest rates then the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has to raise
its rates or the Hong Kong dollar would come under speculative attack. Conversely, if the US lowers its
interest rates the HKMA more or less automatically lowers its interest rates.

Te trilemma is particularly important for developing countries, many of which choose to !x their

exchange rates, for example to the US dollar; but if they choose to do this then they must either give up

control of their monetary policy or impose capital controls if they wish to have some degree of monetary

autonomy. Imposing capital controls may give them some degree of monetary autonomy, though access

to international capital markets is essential to the longer-term process of economic development. On the

  - ther hand, liberalization of capital flows will mean that they have to sacri!ce their monetary autonomy
and will have to raise or lower their interest rates if the Federal Reserve changes US short-term interest
rates, regardless of the state of their economies, should they wish to maintain their !xed exchange rate.

## 4.13 The Principle of Effective Market Classification

While Tinbergen's instruments–targets rule shows us that we generally need two instruments to achieve

both internal and external balance, it does not tell us which instrument should be assigned to which target.

We have seen that we can use combinations of !scal and monetary policy to achieve internal and external

balance under !xed exchange rates or combinations of monetary or !scal policy under floating exchange

rates.

Mundell (1968) suggested that what he called the principle of e$ective market classi!cation should be

used by economic policy-makers in conjunction with Tinbergen's instruments–targets rule. By the principle

- f e$ective market classi!cation, Mundell stated that ‘policies should be paired with the objectives on which
they have the most influence’ (1962, p. 79). For instance, if monetary policy is the most e$ective instrument
at controlling external balance, and !scal policy best at influencing output, then this is also the appropriate
pairing of instruments to targets. Te principle of e$ective market classi!cation seems eminently sensible –
by analogy a conductor should be assigned to conducting an orchestra and a doctor assigned to a hospital
and not vice versa! What makes the Mundell principle of e$ective market classi!cation interesting is the
suggestion that if this principle is not adopted economies may su$er from cyclical instability.

Te problem for economic policy-makers, in determining which instruments to assign to which targets, is

termed the 'assignment problem'. Mundell suggested that under !xed exchange rates monetary policy should

be assigned to external balance and !scal policy to internal balance.

An illustration of the assignment problem is shown in Figure 4.15, which illustrates internal and external

balance schedules for various !scal and monetary policy stances under a !xed exchange rate regime. On

the vertical axis we have monetary policy which is neutral at point _N_ M, but expansionary above this, while

it is contractionary below. Similarly, the !scal policy stance is neutral at point _N_ F, expansionary to the right

and contractionary to the le,. Te internal balance schedule has a negative slope, because if we start at full

employment a contractionary monetary policy has to be accompanied by an expansionary !scal policy to

maintain full employment. To the right of the IB schedule the !scal/monetary policy mix is so expansionary

as to cause inflation, whereas to the le, the !scal/monetary policy mix is deflationary.

98

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

Te external balance schedule may have a positive or negative slope, because an expansionary !scal policy

has two conflicting e$ects on the balance of payments, as we saw in Figures 4.10 and 4.11. On the one hand,

the increase in income leads to a deterioration in the current account which worsens the balance of payments;

- n the other hand the rise in interest rates leads to an inflow of capital which improves the balance of
payments. In Figure 4.15 we have drawn the EB schedule with a negative slope, meaning that an expansionary
!scal policy causes a net deterioration in the balance of payments (the current account e$ect dominates the
capital account e$etc). Tis being the case, when !scal policy is expansionary monetary policy has to be
contractionary, which by raising the domestic interest rate increases capital inflows to ensure equilibrium in
the balance of payments.

In Figure 4.15 the IB schedule is drawn steeper than the EB schedule, which must be the case because a !scal

expansion which causes a rise in income of _x_ % will cause less of a deterioration in the balance of payments than

a monetary policy that increases income by _x_ %. Tis is because a !scal expansion will lead to a rise in interest

rates, leading to a partial o$setting of capital inflows, while a money expansion leads to a fall in interest rates,

leading to an additional deterioration in the balance of payments above the income e$etc. Hence, monetary

policy has more e$ect on external balance than !scal policy. As monetary policy is relatively more e$ective

at influencing external balance, then !scal policy is relatively more e$ective with respect to internal balance.

According to Mundell's classi!cation, if we are at point A with internal balance but a balance of payments

de!cit, a contractionary monetary policy moves the economy to, say, point B on the external balance curve,

Monetary policy

though this leads to unemployment which is then tackled by an expansionary !scal policy moving to point

C on the internal balance curve. Tis pushes the economy back into de!cit, which is then accompanied by a

monetary contraction to achieve external balance. Each time we need less and less adjustment of monetary

and !scal policy; we also have a stable assignment as we are clearly converging to the intersection of the

internal and external balance schedules.

Suppose policy-makers get the assignment wrong and use !scal policy to eradicate the balance of payments

de!cit and monetary policy for internal balance. In such circumstances, the !scal contraction moves the

economy from point A to point D; external balance is achieved but at the cost of high unemployment. If the

authorities then use an expansionary monetary policy to achieve internal balance, the economy moves from

point D to point E. Clearly, such a policy assignment proves to be unstable, moving the economy away from

the simultaneous achievement of internal and external balance. Te danger exists that the authorities could

get the assignment wrong and cause considerable damage to the economy before they eventually reverse their

assignment to the correct one. Given this, it may be wise to try to achieve targets gradually by adjusting policy

instruments slowly to make sure they are having the intended e$etc.

Unfortunately, there is no unambiguous answer to the assignment problem. Consider, for example,

- ur analysis of a small open economy under conditions of perfect capital mobility. We have seen that the
e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policy at influencing output depends upon whether or not there is a !xed or
floating exchange rate. If the exchange rate is !xed then !scal policy should be paired with the objective of full
employment, whereas if the exchange rate is floating then one should assign monetary policy. Te assignment
problem has no simple solution and is considerably more complicated once we have three targets and three
instruments. Te appropriate pairing of instruments and targets depends upon the structural parameters
governing the behaviour of an economy. Tis includes, amongst others, the degree of capital mobility, the
marginal propensities to save and import, the income and interest elasticity of demand for money, the price
elasticity of demand for imports and exports, and the responsiveness of investment to interest rate variations.

## 4.14 Limitations of the Mundell–Fleming Model

Te IS–LM–BP model has been one of the major policy models underlying economic policy formulation

for open economies over the last !ve decades. Given this, we need to look at some of the limitations of the

model, not least because these criticisms were one of the reasons motivating the formulation of the monetary

approach to the balance of payments and economic policy that is the subject matter of Chapter 5. A number

- f the criticisms relate to the short-run nature of the model:
 - **Te Marshall–Lerner condition.** Te model assumes that the Marshall–Lerner condition holds, even
though the model is essentially of a short-term nature, which is the time scale when the Marshall–
Lerner conditions are least likely to be met.

 - **Interaction of stocks and flows.** Te model ignores the problem of the interaction of stocks and
flows. According to the model a current account de!cit can be !nanced by a capital inflow. While
such a policy is feasible in the short run, a capital inflow over time increases the stock of foreign
liabilities owed by the country to the rest of the world, and this factor means a worsening of the
future current account as interest is paid abroad. Clearly, a country cannot go on !nancing a current
account de!cit inde!nitely as the country becomes an ever-increasing debtor to the rest of the world.

 - **Neglect of long-run budget constraints.** In an excellent review of the Mundell–Fleming model,
Frenkel and Razin (1987) highlight the fact that one of the major de!ciencies of the model is that

100

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

it fails to take account of long-run constraints that govern both the private and public sector. In

the long run, private-sector spending has to equal its disposable income, while, in the absence of

money creation, government expenditure (inclusive of its debt-service repayments) has to equal its

revenue from taxation. Tis means that in the long run the current account has to be in balance. One

implication of these budget constraints is that a forward-looking private sector would realize that

increased government expenditure will imply higher taxation for them in the future, and this will

induce increased private-sector savings today that will undermine the e$ectiveness of !scal policy.

- **Wealth effects.** Te model does not allow for wealth e$ects that may help in the process of restoring
long-run equilibrium. A decrease in wealth resulting from a fall in foreign assets will ordinarily lead
to a reduction in import expenditure which should help to reduce the current account de!cit. While
such an omission of wealth e$ects on the import expenditure function may be justi!ed as being of
small signi!cance in the short run, the omission nevertheless again emphasizes the essentially shortterm nature of the model.

- **Neglect of supply-side factors.** One of the obvious limitations of the model is that it concentrates
  - n the demand side of the economy and neglects the supply side. Tere is an implicit assumption
that supply adjusts in accordance with changes in demand. In addition, because the aggregate supply
curve is horizontal up to full employment, increases in aggregate demand do not lead to changes in
the domestic price level; rather they are reflected solely by increases in real output.

- **Treatment of capital flows.** One of the biggest problems of the model concerns the modelling of
capital flows. It is assumed that a rise in the domestic interest rate leads to a continuous capital
inflow from abroad. However, to expect such flows to continue inde!nitely is unrealistic because,
a,er a point, international investors will have rearranged the stocks of their international portfolios
to their desired portfolios, and once this happens the net capital inflows into the country will cease.
Te only way that the country could then continue to attract capital inflows would be a further rise
in its interest rate until once again international portfolios are restored to desired portfolios. Hence,
a country that needs a continuous capital inflow to !nance its current account de!cit has to raise
continuously its interest rate. In other words, capital inflows are a function of the change in the
interest di$erential rather than the di$erential itself.

- **Exchange rate expectations.** A major problem with the model is the treatment of exchange rate
expectations. Te model does not explicitly model exchange rate expectations but rather implicitly
presumes that the expected change of the exchange rate is zero, which is known as a 'static
exchange rate expectation'. While this might not seem to be an unreasonable assumption under
!xed exchange rates, it is less tenable under floating exchange rates. According to the model a
monetary expansion leads to a depreciation of the currency under floating exchange rates – in such
circumstances it seems unreasonable to assume that economic agents do not expect a depreciation
as well. If agents expect a depreciation this may require a rise in the domestic interest rate to
encourage them to continue to hold the currency which will have an adverse e$ect on domestic
investment – implying a weaker expansionary e$etc of monetary policy than is suggested by the
model.

- **Flexibility of policy instruments.** Another criticism is that the analysis is of a comparative static
nature and assumes that adjusting monetary and !scal policy is a fairly simple matter. In the real
world, the political process means that the degree of flexibility to adjust economic policy, especially
!scal policy, is hard to achieve.

## 4.15 Conclusions

In this chapter we have illustrated some important aspects concerning the conduct of economic policy in

an open economy. While !scal and/or monetary policy may be useful in achieving full employment, they

will also have important implications for the balance of payments and exchange rate which will in turn have

feedback e$ects on the domestic economy. Economic policy formulation in an open economy has to take into

account many important additional considerations compared to a simple closed economy.

Among the most important lessons for economic policy-makers is that they generally need as many

independent policy instruments as they have targets. Tis result is important because the idea that the

authorities can use a single policy instrument such as monetary policy alone to achieve all the targets of

economic policy is highly questionable. Nevertheless, policy-makers still have a major policy problem in

deciding which instrument to assign to which target. Since the structures of economies di$er, no general

rules exist to solve this problem. Teory warns that an incorrect assignment may provoke rather than limit

instability in the economy.

In the real world the achievement of internal and external balance will be far more difficult than our

theoretical analysis has suggested. Policy-makers face uncertainty over means–end relationships, there are

time-lag problems, the authorities are in possession of only limited information about the position of an

economy, and economies are continually being subjected to new shocks as well as adjusting to previous shocks.

In practice, getting close to targets is likely to be the name of the game rather than actually achieving them.

We have seen that the relative e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policy is very much dependent upon the

choice of exchange rate regime. In particular, with perfect capital mobility, monetary policy is more e$ective

under a floating exchange rate regime, while !scal policy is more e$ective under a !xed exchange rate. One of

the crucial parameters determining the e$ectiveness of both !scal and monetary policy in an open economy

is the degree of !nancial integration of an economy with the rest of the world as reflected by the mobility of

capital internationally.

Although the Mundell–Fleming model has many limitations, it nonetheless focuses attention on the

difficulties and dilemmas facing policy-makers in an open economy. Perhaps its most signi!cant contribution

to international economics is that it focuses on the important role that international capital flows can play in

determining the e$ectiveness of macroeconomic policies under alternative exchange rate regimes.
