5.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we shall look at one of the most influential policy analyses of the balance of payments known

as the monetary approach. Tis approach to balance of payments analysis was pioneered by Marina Whitman

(1975) and Jacob Frenkel and Harry Johnson (1976). Te fundamental basis of the monetary approach is

that the balance of payments is essentially a monetary phenomenon. Not only is the balance of payments

a measurement of monetary flows, but such flows can only be explained by a disequilibrium in the stock

demand for and supply of money.

Tere are several variants of the monetary approach to the balance of payments, and not all advocates

- f it necessarily accept all the assumptions used. We shall outline a simple model that captures the essential
message of the monetary approach – that disequilibrium in the balance of payments reflects disequilibrium
in the money market. Consequently, balance of payments analysis needs to focus on both the supply of and
demand for money.

Within the context of the monetary model, we shall examine how a devaluation will impinge upon the

balance of payments. We then proceed to examine how the model can be used to highlight some fundamentally

di$erent implications of !xed and floating exchange rates. We will compare and contrast the e$ects of a

money supply shock, a rise in domestic income and a foreign price shock under !xed and floating rates. We

International Finance

will then summarize the policy implications of the monetary approach and consider how the model di$ers

from the Keynesian model examined in Chapter 4.

## 5.2 A Simple Monetary Model

Tere are three key assumptions that underlie the monetary model; these are a stable money demand function,

a vertical aggregate supply schedule and purchasing power parity (PPP).

_Stable money demand function_

Te most basic postulate of the monetary approach to the balance of payments is that there is a stable demand

for money function that is made up of only a few variables. Te monetarists use the quantity theory of money

as the basis of the money demand function, which is written as:

_M_ d [�] _kPy where k_          - 0 (5.1)

where _M_ d is the demand for nominal money balances, _P_ is the domestic price level, _y_ is real domestic%income

and _k_ is a parameter that measures the sensitivity of money demand to changes in nominal income.

Te demand for money is a positive function of the domestic price level, because the demand for money is

a demand for real money balances. A rise in the domestic price level will reduce real money balances ( _M_ / _P_ )

and accordingly lead to an equiproportionate increase in the demand for money. Te demand for money is

positively related to real domestic income: a rise in real income will, _ceteris paribus_, lead to an increase in

the transactions demand for money. Te money demand function forms the basis of the aggregate demand

schedule, which is illustrated in Figure 5.1 for a simple monetary model.

From equation (5.1), if we hold the money supply/money demand !xed and assume that _k_ is a !xed

parameter, then an increase in _y_ from _y_ 1 to _y_ 2 requires an equiproportionate fall in the price level from _P_ 1 to

_P_ 2. Since _P_ 1 _y_ 1 = _P_ 2 _y_ 2 the aggregate demand schedule is a rectangular hyperbola given by AD1. A fall in the

price level from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2, given a !xed money supply, will create excess real money balances ( _M_ / _P_ ) and this

leads to increased aggregate demand from _y_ 1 to _y_ 2. An increase in the money supply has the e$etc of shi,ing

the aggregate demand schedule to the right from AD1 to AD2, because at any given price level there is a rise in

real money balances which leads to increased aggregate demand.

_Vertical aggregate supply schedule_

Te simple monetary model assumes that the labour market is sufficiently flexible that the economy is

continuously at a full employment level of output. In other words, wages are sufficiently flexible that they are

constantly at the level that equates the supply and demand for labour. Furthermore, a rise in the domestic

price level does not lead to an increase in domestic output because wages adjust immediately to the higher

price level so that there is no advantage for domestic producers to take on more labour. Tis means that the

aggregate supply schedule is vertical at the full employment level of output, as shown in Figure 5.2.

Although the aggregate supply schedule AS1 is vertical at the full employment level of output _y_ 1, this does

not mean that output is always constrained to be !xed at _y_ 1; the aggregate supply schedule may shi, to the

right to, say, AS2 if there is an improvement in productivity due to technological progress, which means that

full employment is associated with a higher level of real output.

_Purchasing power parity (PPP)_

Te !nal assumption that underpins the monetary model is the assumption of purchasing power parity (PPP).

PPP theory is examined in much more detail in Chapter 6, but for the time being we can state that in its simpli!ed

version the theory says that the exchange rate adjusts such as to keep the following equation in equilibrium:

_S_ = _[P]_ _P_ = _SP_                  - (5.2)

_P_                 - [that is,]

where _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency per unit of foreign currency, so that a rise is a

depreciation and a fall is an appreciation of the domestic currency; _P_ is the domestic price level in the domestic

currency; and _P_ - is the foreign price in the foreign currency.

Equation (5.2) states that if a basket of goods costs £100 in the UK, and the same basket costs \$200 in the

USA, then the £/$ exchange rate should be £0.50/\$1. Tis means that the basket of goods has the same price in

both countries. If the exchange rate were above £0.50/$1, say at £0.60/$1, then the US bundle would cost a UK

citizen \$200 × 0.60 = £120, while the UK bundle would cost a US citizen £100/0.6 = \$166.66. Conversely, an

exchange rate below PPP, say at £0.40/\$1, would mean the US bundle of goods would cost a UK citizen \$200 ×

0.4 = £80, while the UK bundle would cost a US citizen £100/0.40 = \$250. According to the theory this would

lead to a rush to buy US goods and a depreciation of the pound until it was restored to £0.50/\$1.

Figure 5.3 depicts the PPP schedule which shows combinations of the domestic price level and exchange

rate which are compatible with PPP, given the foreign price level _P_ *. It has a slope given by _P_ - and implies that

an _x_ % rise in the domestic price level requires an _x_ % depreciation (rise) of the home currency to maintain

PPP. Points to the le, of the PPP schedule represent an overvaluation of the domestic currency in relation to

PPP, whereas points to the right show undervaluation in relation to PPP.

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

Te simple monetary model invokes the three assumptions set out above and then proceeds with the use

- f some accounting identities and behavioural assumptions to develop a theory of the balance of payments.

Te domestic monetary supply in the economy is made up of two components:

Ms � _D_                - _R_ (5.3)

where _M_ s is the domestic money base, _D_ is domestic bond holdings of the monetary authorities and _R_ is the

reserves of foreign currencies.

Te monetary base can come into circulation in one of two ways. First, the authorities may conduct an

- pen market operation (OMO), which involves the central bank purchasing Treasury bonds held by private
agents; this increases the central bank's monetary liabilities but increases its assets of domestic bond holdings,
which is the domestic component of the monetary base as represented by _D_ . Second, the authorities may
conduct a foreign exchange operation (FXO) which involves the central bank purchasing foreign currency
assets (money or foreign Treasury bonds) held by private agents. Tis again increases the central bank's
liabilities but increases its assets of foreign currency and foreign bonds which are represented by _R_ .

We can now rewrite equation (5.3) in di$erence form as:

d _M_ S [�] d _D_                - d _R_ (5.4)

Equation (5.4) states that any increase (decrease) in the domestic money supply can come about through

either an OMO, as represented by d _D_, or an FXO, as represented by d _R_ . Te relationship between the money

supply and reserves is illustrated in Figure 5.4.

In the !gure, at point _D_ 1 all the domestic money supply is made up entirely of the domestic component,

since reserves are zero. For convenience we set the exchange rate of the domestic to foreign currency equal to

unity; this being the case an increase of 1 unit of foreign currency leads to an increase in the domestic money

supply of 1 unit, so that when reserves are _R_ 1 the money supply is _M_ 1, that is, _D_ 1 + _R_ 1.

An OMO will have the e$ect of shi,ing the _M_ s schedule by the amount of the increase in the central bank’s

domestic bond holdings. An OMO which increases the domestic component of the monetary base from _D_ 1

to _D_ 2 shi,s the money supply schedule from _M_ s1 to _M_ s2 and the total money supply rises from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 and

is represented by a movement from point A to point C. By contrast, an expansion of the money supply due to

a purchase of foreign currencies, that is an FXO, increases the country’s foreign exchange reserves from _R_ 1 to

_R_ 2. Tis, too, has the e$etc of raising the money stock from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 and is represented by a movement along

the money supply schedule _M_ s1 from point A to point B.

## 5.3 The Monetarist Concept of Balance of Payments Disequilibrium

Te monetarists view balance of payments surpluses and de!cits as monetary flow due to stock disequilibrium

in the money market. A de!cit in the balance of payments is due to an excess of the money supply in relation to

money demand, while a surplus is a monetary flow resulting from an excess demand for money in relation to

the stock money supply. Tus a balance of payments disequilibrium is merely a reflection of a disequilibrium

in the money market. In this sense the monetary flows are the 'autonomous' items in the balance of payments,

while the purchases and sales of goods/services and investments (long, medium and short-term) are viewed as

the accommodating items. Tis is completely the reverse of the Keynesian approach which views the current

account items as autonomous and the capital account and reserve changes as the accommodating items.

Tis di$erent way of looking at the balance of payments statistics is sometimes contrasted by saying that

Keynesians look at the balance of payments statistics from the 'top down' (that is, the current account), while

the monetarists look from the 'bottom up' (the change in reserves).

Monetarists observe that the overall balance of payments (BP) can be thought of as consisting of the current

account balance, the capital account balance and the changes in the authorities' reserves. Tat is:

_BP_                - _CA_                - _K_                - d _R_                - 0

so that:

_CA_               - _K_               - �d _R_ (5.5)

where _CA_ is the current account balance, _K_ is the capital account balance and d _R_ is the change in the authorities'

reserves. If the recorded d _R_ in the balance of payments accounts is positive, this means that the combined

current account and capital account are in de!cit. Tis implies that reserves have fallen as the authorities have

purchased the home currency with foreign currency reserves (remember a rise in foreign exchange reserves

is recorded as negative and a fall as positive in the balance of payments).

Equation (5.5) is a distinct way of viewing the balance of payments; increases in reserves due to purchases

- f foreign currencies constitute a surplus in the balance of payments, while falls in reserves resulting from
purchases of the domestic currency represent a de!cit in the balance of payments. If the authorities do not
intervene in the foreign exchange market, that is, the currency is le, to float, then reserves do not change and,
as far as the monetary view is concerned, the balance of payments is in equilibrium. Under a floating exchange

108

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

rate regime a current account de!cit must be !nanced by an equivalent capital inflow so that the balance of

payments is in equilibrium.

With this concept of a balance of payments surplus/de!cit in mind we can proceed to an analysis of the

e$ects of various shocks under both !xed and floating exchange rates.

Te model is in equilibrium when aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply so that there is no excess

demand for goods, which is given by the intersection of the aggregate demand and supply schedules at price

level _P_ 1 and output level _y_ 1 in Figure 5.5(b). Also, PPP holds in the foreign exchange market so that at price

level _P_ 1 and the exogenous foreign price level _P_ - the exchange rate compatible with PPP is given by _S_ 1 in

Figure 5.5(a). Finally, the money market is in equilibrium, with the money supply _M_ 1 made up of the domestic

component _D_ 1 and reserve component _R_ 1 and is equal to money demand in Figure 5.5(c). Te _M_ s schedule _M_ S1

cuts the money demand schedule _M_ d1. Te precise position of the money demand schedule is determined by

the domestic price level and domestic income level. Equilibrium in the money market also implies equilibrium

in the balance of payments.

We are now in a position to examine the e$ects of various shocks within the context of the monetary

approach to the balance of payments.

## 5.4 The Effects of a Devaluation

Te monetary approach argues that a devaluation can only have an a$etc on the balance of payments by

influencing the demand for money in relation to the supply of money.

In Figure 5.6 the immediate e$etc of a devaluation of the exchange rate from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2 is to make domestic

goods competitive in relation to PPP. As domestic goods become more competitive compared to foreign

goods there is an increase in the demand for the domestic currency as represented by a shi, of the money

demand schedule from _M_ d1 to _M_ d2. Tis means that money demand _M_ 2 exceeds the money supply _M_ 1. Te

competitive advantage of the devaluation means that the balance of payments moves into surplus as domestic

residents demand fewer foreign goods/services, while foreigners demand more domestic goods. To prevent

the domestic currency appreciating, the authorities have to purchase the foreign currency with the new

domestic money base. Tis increases the reserves and leads to an expansion of the domestic money supply

which in turn raises aggregate demand for domestically produced goods. Te aggregate demand schedule

shi,s to the right from AD1 to AD2 and starts pushing up domestic prices until PPP is restored at price _P_ 2.

110

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

Once the domestic price level is at _P_ 2 and the money supply has increased to _M_ 2, real money balances will

be at their equilibrium level ( _M_ 1/ _P_ 1 = _M_ 2/ _P_ 2) and the competitive advantage of the devaluation has been o$set.

Te balance of payments will be back in equilibrium as money supply is once again equal to money demand.

In the long run, the e$etc of an _x_ % devaluation is to lead to an _x_ % rise in the domestic price level and an _x_ %

increase in the domestic money stock. In other words, the surplus resulting from a devaluation is merely a

transitory phenomenon.

Te monetary approach emphasizes that a devaluation will have a transitory bene!cial e$etc on the balance

- f payments only so long as the authorities do not simultaneously engage in an expansionary OMO. If the
authorities immediately increase the money stock to _M_ 2 via an OMO, there would be an immediate rise in
aggregate demand and domestic prices to _P_ 2 so that the competitive advantage conferred by a devaluation
would be eliminated.

Te important point derived from the monetary model concerning the e$etc of a devaluation is that

exchange rate changes are viewed as incapable of bringing about a lasting change in the balance of payments.

A devaluation or revaluation operates strictly by causing a disequilibrium in the money market, leading to a

de!cit or surplus in the balance of payments which continues only until equilibrium is restored in the money

market via reserve changes.

## 5.5 A Monetary Exchange Rate Equation

Before we compare and contrast the e$ects of various shocks under !xed and floating exchange rates we need

to consider how the exchange rate is determined in the context of our simple monetary model. As we have

seen in equation (5.1), which is repeated below as equation (5.6), the demand for money in the home country

is given by:

_M_ d = _kPy_ (5.6)

Tis being the case, we can postulate that the demand for money in the foreign economy is of a similar type,

given below as:

_M_ d* [=] _k P_           -           - _y_           - (5.7)

where _M_ d* denotes foreign money demand, _k_ - is the foreign nominal income elasticity of demand for money,

_P_ - is the foreign price level and _y_ - is real foreign income.

Te exchange rate is determined by PPP so that:

_P_

_S_ = (5.8)

_P_                   

In equilibrium, money demand is equal to the money supply in each country, so that:

_M_ s = _M_ d and _M_ s* = _M_ d* (5.9)

111

International Finance

Tis being the case, we can denote the relative money supply functions as equation (5.6) divided by (5.7),

replacing _M_ d and _M_ d* with _M_ s and _M_ s* from equation (5.9):

_MsMs_                       - = _k P_                       - _kPy_                       - _y_                       - (5.10)

Since _P_ / _P_ - = _S_ because of PPP, we can rewrite equation (5.10) as:

_Ms_ = _kSy_

_Ms_              - _k_              - _y_              - (5.11)

Solving the above equation for the exchange rate yields:

_S_

= _Ms_ / _Ms_ _ky k_ /  - _y_  

(5.12)

Equation (5.12) states that the exchange rate is determined by the relative supply and demand for the di$erent

national money stocks. An increase in the domestic money stock relative to the foreign money stock will

lead to a depreciation (rise) of the home currency, while an increase in domestic income relative to foreign

income leads to an appreciation (fall) of the home currency exchange rate – the reason being that an increase

in income leads to an increased transactions demand for the home currency leading to an appreciation. With

this simple model of exchange rate determination in mind we can proceed to analyse in more detail the e$ects

- f money supply, income changes and changes in the foreign price level.

5.6 A MONEY SUPPLY EXPANSION UNDER FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

If the exchange rate of a currency is !xed, this means that the authorities have to buy the currency when it is

in excess supply and sell the currency when it is in excess demand in the foreign exchange market to avoid

a currency depreciation or appreciation. When the authorities sell the domestic currency this leads to a rise

in their reserves of foreign currency. If the authorities buy the domestic currency they do so with foreign

currency, and so their reserves fall.

Let us now consider what happens if there is an expansionary OMO under a !xed exchange rate which

raises the money supply by a central bank purchase of Treasury bonds. In Figure 5.7 an expansionary OMO

shi,s the money supply schedule from _M_ s1 to _M_ s2 and increases the domestic money supply from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2, the

domestic component of the monetary base rising from _D_ 1 to _D_ 2. Te immediate e$etc is that domestic residents

have excess real money balances ( _M_ 2/ _P_ 1 > _M_ 1/ _P_ 1), that is, the money supply _M_ 2 exceeds money demand _M_ 1.

To reduce their excess real balances, residents increase aggregate demand for goods as represented by a shi,

- f the aggregate demand schedule from AD1 to AD2, and this puts upward pressure on domestic goods prices,
which rise from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2. At price _P_ 2 and !xed exchange rate _S_ 1 the domestic economy is uncompetitive in
relation to PPP as it !nds itself to the le, of the PPP schedule.

Te uncompetitive nature of the economy moves the balance of payments into de!cit. To prevent a

devaluation of the currency, the authorities have to intervene to purchase the domestic currency, causing

their reserves to start to decline below _R_ 1. Te purchase back of the domestic money supply starts to reduce

the excess money supply and at the same time aggregate demand starts to shi, back from AD2 towards AD1.

As the excess money balances are reduced, this puts downward pressure on the domestic price level which

falls back to its original level _P_ 1 so as to arrive back at PPP. Once the money supply returns to _M_ 1 along the _M_ S2

schedule the excess supply of money is eliminated and the economy is restored to equilibrium.

In the long run, the price level, output level and money stock return to their initial levels. Tus, an

increase in the domestic component of the monetary base from _D_ 1 to _D_ 2 will, because of the foreign exchange

intervention it necessitates to maintain a !xed exchange rate, lead to an equivalent fall in the reserves from _R_ 1

to _R_ 2. Tis fall in the reserves due to purchases of the home currency leads to a return of the money stock to its

- riginal level. Te fact that the money supply has to return to its original level can be explained by reference to
equation (5.12). As the parameters _S_, _M_ S*, _ky_ and _k_ - _y_ - are all !xed, any rise in _M_ S must eventually be reversed
for the equation to hold.

113

International Finance

Te monetary approach regards the balance of payments de!cits resulting from the expansion in the

money stock to be merely a temporary and self-correcting phenomenon. An expansion of the money supply

causes a temporary excess supply of money and a current and capital account de!cit which, to maintain the

!xed exchange rate, necessitates intervention in the foreign exchange market which eventually eliminates the

excess supply of the currency.

Tere are two circumstances under which a balance of payments de!cit can become more than a transitory

feature. One case is when the authorities practise sterilization of their foreign exchange operations. When

the authorities intervene to purchase their currency to prevent it being devalued there is a reduction of the

monetary base. Te authorities could try to o$set these money-base implications by conducting a further

- pen market purchase of bonds from the public; however, as we have seen, such an open market operation
causes a balance of payments de!cit requiring a further foreign exchange intervention. Hence, sterilization
policies can cause prolonged balance of payments de!cits. Te pursuit of such sterilization operations will be
limited by the extent of a country's reserves.

Another factor that can lead to a continuous de!cit would be if the surplus countries were prepared to

purchase the de!cit country's currency and hold it in their reserves. In such circumstances, the de!cit country

will have its exchange rate !xed by foreign central bank intervention; such a process can continue so long as

foreign central banks are prepared to accumulate the home country's currency in their reserves. Although

in this case reserve changes are zero, the de!cit is reflected as an increase in liabilities to foreign authorities.

5.7 A MONEY SUPPLY EXPANSION UNDER FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES

Under floating exchange rates the monetary approach maintains that there is no such thing as a balance of

payments de!cit or surplus as the authorities do not intervene to purchase or sell the domestic currency. Since

there are no changes in international reserves there is no balance of payments surplus or de!cit. Referring

to equation (5.6), as the change in reserves is zero, any current account de!cit (surplus) has to be o$set by a

net capital inflow (outflow) of a like amount. Figure 5.8 illustrates the e$ects of a monetary expansion under

floating exchange rates.

An expansionary OMO leads to a rise in the money stock from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 and creates excess money balances.

Te result is that the aggregate demand shi,s from AD1 to AD2 with demand _y_ 2 exceeding domestic output _y_ 1. Te

excess demand for goods translates into increased expenditure on foreign goods/services and investments leading

to a depreciation of the exchange rate from S1 to S2. As a result of the excess demand for goods the domestic price

level begins to rise and this leads to an increase in money demand, as reflected by an upward shi, of the money

demand function from _M_ d1 towards _M_ d2. As the domestic price level rises this increases the demand for money

leading to a contraction of aggregate demand along the AD2 schedule until equilibrium price level _P_ 2 is achieved.

In the long run, the e$etc of an _x_ % increase in the money stock is an _x_ % depreciation of the exchange rate

and an _x_ % increase in the domestic price level. Te rise in the price level induces a rise in the demand for

money so that the excess money balances created by the OMO are eliminated. With reference to equation

(5.12) we can see that, with the parameters _M_ s*, _ky_ and _k_ - _y_ - all !xed, any rise in _M_ s leads to a rise in the

exchange rate _S_ for the equation to hold.

Te case of floating exchange rates provides a clear contrast with the !xed exchange rate case. Under

!xed exchange rates an expansionary OMO leads to a disequilibrium in the money market which is resolved

by adjustment in the balance of payments and reserves held by the authorities. Under floating exchange

rates an expansion in the monetary base leads to a depreciation of the exchange rate and a rise in domestic

prices.%Under !xed exchange rates the authorities can no longer retain independent control of the money

supply – the quantity of money returns to its original level due to a gradual fall in the international reserves

held by the authorities. Whereas under floating exchange rates they can determine the amount of the money

supply, money market equilibrium is restored by changes in money demand brought about by changes in

the domestic price level and exchange rate. One of the arguments against !xed exchange rates is that the

authorities can no longer conduct independent monetary policies, while with floating exchange rates the

authorities are free to expand and contract the money supply to their desired levels.

Having contrasted the e$ects of a money supply expansion under both exchange rate regimes, we will now

consider the contrasting e$ects of changes in domestic income and foreign price level.

5.8 THE EFFECTS OF AN INCREASE IN INCOME UNDER FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

Within the context of the monetary approach to the balance of payments an increase in domestic income

can only have an e$ect on the balance of payments by influencing money demand in relation to the money

supply. Figure 5.9 shows the e$ects of an increase in domestic income under !xed exchange rates. Te increase

in real domestic income is represented by a rightward shi, of the aggregate supply schedule from AS1 to

AS2. As a result of the increase in domestic income the demand to hold money increases, which shi,s the

115

International Finance

money demand function from _M_ d1 to _M_ d2. Te result is that money demand _M_ 2 exceeds the money supply _M_ 1.

Te result is reduced expenditure on both domestic and foreign goods/services, which leads to a fall in the

domestic price level from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2. Te fall in the domestic price level means that at the !xed exchange rate _S_ 1

the country gains a competitive advantage and the current and capital account move into surplus. To prevent

an appreciation of the currency the authorities have to purchase the foreign currency with the newly created

money base, and as a result of the intervention in the foreign exchange market there is a rise in the reserves

and in the domestic money supply. Te increase in the money supply shi,s the aggregate demand schedule

from AD1 to AD2, which leads to a rise in the domestic price level back towards its PPP value _P_ 1. Once the

money stock has risen to _M_ 2 the excess money balances are eliminated.

Notice that in the long run, while the price level has returned to its original level _P_ 1, the money stock

has risen from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 because of the transitory balance of payments surplus. Tis means that real money

balances are greater than before; that is, _M_ 2/ _P_ 1 is greater than _M_ 1/ _P_ 1. Te reason why this is possible is that all

the increased money stock is willingly held as transactions balances due to the increase in domestic income.

In terms of equation (5.12), given that _S_, _M_ S* and _k_ - _y_ - are all !xed, the increase in domestic income is o$set

by the rise in the domestic money supply.

5.9 THE EFFECTS OF AN INCREASE IN INCOME UNDER FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES

An increase in income under floating exchange rates has its impact on the exchange rate by influencing the demand

for money in relation to the supply of money, as shown in Figure 5.10. An increase in income leads to an increase

in the transactions demand for money and implies an excess supply of goods ( _y_ 2 > _y_ 1) at the existing price level _P_ 1.

Tis means that there is a downward pressure on the domestic price level which falls from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2 so as to equate

aggregate demand and supply. As the price level falls, the exchange rate appreciates so as to maintain PPP. Eventually,

new equilibrium is obtained at a lower domestic price level _P_ 2 and an exchange rate appreciation from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2.

In the long run, we note that there has been an increase in real money balances as _M_ 1/ _P_ 2 is greater than

_M_ 1/ _P_ 1. Again, the reason for this is that the increase in real domestic income raises the demand for transactions

balances, so that the increased real money balances are willingly held. Overall, the money demand schedule

did not shi, because, while the fall in domestic prices leads to less money demand, this is exactly o$set by the

rise in money demand due to the increase in real income. In terms of equation (5.12) the !xed parameters are

_M_ s, _M_ s* and _k_ - _y_ *; a rise in _ky_ due to an increase in income therefore implies an appreciation (fall) in _S_ .

Under !xed exchange rates with an increase in domestic income, eventual adjustment is obtained via an

increase in the domestic money supply and reserves so as to satisfy the increased money demand; while

under a floating exchange rate equilibrium is obtained by an appreciation of the exchange rate and a fall in the

domestic price level (to maintain PPP) with the domestic money supply unchanged.

5.10 AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN PRICES UNDER FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

Te e$ects of an increase in the foreign price level under !xed exchange rates are shown in Figure 5.11. An

increase in the foreign price level means that the PPP line swivels upwards from PPP1 to PPP2. Tis is because

at the exchange rate _S_ 1, a rise in the foreign price level means that at price level _P_ 1 the domestic economy is

now more competitive than PPP. Accordingly, to maintain PPP at the exchange rate _S_ 1 requires a rise in the

domestic price level to _P_ 2.

Te initial e$etc of the rise in foreign prices is to make domestic goods at price _P_ 1 more competitive

compared to foreign goods. Tis results in reduced consumption of foreign goods, creating a balance of

payments surplus and an increase in the demand for the domestic currency, which is shown by a shi, of the

money demand schedule from _M_ d1 to _M_ d2. To prevent an appreciation of the currency the authorities have to

purchase foreign currencies with the newly created domestic money base. Te reserves rise from _R_ 1 to _R_ 2 and

the money supply rises from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2. Te increased money supply and undervaluation of the currency in

relation to PPP lead to a shi, to the right of the aggregate demand schedule from AD1 to AD2 which pushes

up domestic prices from _P_ 1 towards _P_ 2 where PPP is restored. Once PPP is restored, the balance of payments

surplus ceases.

An important point that emerges from this analysis is that by choosing to peg its exchange rate the country

also has to eventually accept that movements in its domestic price level will be determined by changes in the

world price level. A country that decides to peg its exchange rate therefore runs the risk of imported inflation/

deflation. If foreign inflation is determined by changes in the foreign money supply, the monetary approach

suggests that a country that opts to !x its exchange rate must change its money supply in line with changes

in the foreign money supply. Hence, countries that opt to !x their exchange rates give up their monetary

autonomy. As we shall see in the next section, this is not the case with floating exchange rates.

5.11 AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN PRICES UNDER FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES

Te e$ects of a rise in the foreign price level when the exchange rate is le, to float freely are depicted in

Figure%5.12. A rise in the foreign price level leads to a swivel of the PPP line from PPP1 to PPP2. With a floating

exchange rate the competitive advantage to the domestic economy is o$set by an appreciation of the currency

from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2 to maintain PPP at the existing domestic price level _P_ 1. Hence, with a floating exchange rate, the

domestic price level and aggregate demand and output are le, una$ected by the foreign price shock.

Te insulation of the domestic economy from the foreign price shock, under floating exchange rates with

the authorities able to operate an independent monetary policy, stands in contrast to the imported inflation

experienced under !xed exchange rates. One of the most powerful arguments made by the proponents of

floating exchange rates is that it gives the authorities the ability to avoid imported inflation/deflation. In e$ect

a floating exchange rate enables the authorities to pursue an independent monetary policy. Te exchange

rate will adjust to o$set an inflation di$erential and maintain PPP. Under !xed exchange rates the need to

maintain PPP means that an economy has to accept an inflation rate determined by the rate of growth of

the foreign money supply – hence monetary independence is lost. However, this independence of monetary

policy depends crucially upon the exchange rate adjusting in line with PPP.

5.12 IMPLICATIONS OF THE MONETARY APPROACH

Te distinctive feature of the monetary approach to the balance of payments is that money market disequilibrium

is seen as a crucial factor in provoking balance of payments disequilibrium. It is maintained that the crucial

decision of private agents concerns the level of their real money balances. With real output !xed, aggregate

expenditure is viewed as a function of real money balances rather than income. In the monetary model agents

decide !rstly upon the amount of real balances they wish to hold and then spend accordingly, and not the

- ther way round. In this sense, it is money decisions that matter and not the expenditure ones.

Te core of the monetary approach is that the demand for money function is a stable and predictable

function of relatively few variables. Variables such as the price elasticities of demand for goods and services

and foreign exchange are not considered to be important.

A major implication of the monetary approach is that in a !xed exchange-rate regime the authorities have

to accept a loss of control over their domestic monetary policy as the price of !xing the exchange rate. As we

have seen, any attempt to expand the domestic money supply under !xed exchange rates leads to a balance

- f payments de!cit and the need to purchase back the currency on the foreign exchange market. If foreign
prices rise then so does the domestic money supply and domestic price level. Under !xed exchange rates the
authorities lose the ability to pursue an independent monetary policy. Te only thing that they can do is to
control the composition of the monetary base between its domestic and foreign components. With a !xed
exchange rate, an increase in the domestic component of the monetary base leads to an equivalent fall in the
foreign component.

A further implication of the monetarist approach is that from the viewpoint of the balance of payments it

is irrelevant whether the change in the money supply results from an OMO or an FXO. As far as monetarists

are concerned both operations can bring about disequilibrium in the money market. An expansion of the

domestic monetary base under !xed exchange rates, whether arising from a purchase of domestic bonds or a

purchase of foreign currencies, causes an excess of real money balances. Te result is a balance of payments

de!cit which requires the authorities to intervene to support their currency – the reserves decline until the

money supply is brought back to its original level and excess balances are eliminated.

Te contrast between !xed and floating exchange rates in the monetary model is pronounced. Under !xed

exchange rates monetary policy is endogenously determined by the need to peg the exchange rate, while with

a floating exchange rate the country can exogenously determine its money supply because it is the exchange

rate and not monetary changes that restore equilibrium.

120

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

Tere is a split in the monetarist camp over the desirability of !xed as opposed to floating exchange rates.

Some monetarists argue that, because balance of payments de!cits and surpluses are necessarily transitory

and self-correcting, then countries should agree to permanently !x their exchange rates and enjoy the bene!ts

- f stable exchange rates. On the other hand, Milton Friedman long advocated that authorities should allow
exchange rates to float so that countries are le, free to determine their own rates of inflation and monetary
policies independently of other countries. Many other arguments are brought into play in the !xed versus
floating exchange rate debate and these are examined in more detail in Chapter 10.

5.13 EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE MONETARY APPROACH

Much of the empirical evidence on the monetary approach concerns the attempts to measure the so-called

'o$set coefficient’. Te o$set coefficient measures the extent to which an increase in the domestic component

- f the money base leads to a fall in reserves of a like amount in a !xed exchange rate regime, as postulated by
the monetary approach. To validate the monetary model, empirical estimates of the o$set coefficient under
!xed exchange rates require that it be equal to minus one, that is, an increase in the domestic component of
the monetary base leads to an exactly o$setting fall in the reserves. Some of the better-known estimates of the

- $set coefficient covering various countries and periods of the !xed exchange rate system that prevailed prior
to 1973 are presented in Table 5.1.

**Table 5.1** Empirical estimates of the o$set coefficient

International Finance

As we can see, the empirical evidence on the monetary approach is somewhat mixed. In the Bean (1976)

and Kouri and Porter (1974) studies, the o$set coefficient is of the correct sign and statistically di$erent

from minus unity. One explanation that may help to explain the lower than expected o$set coefficient was

put forward by Magee (1976) who pointed out that exchange rates were not rigidly !xed under the Bretton

Woods system. Tis being the case, part of an increase in the domestic component of the monetary base may

be absorbed by a depreciation of the exchange rate rather than a fall in the reserves.

Nonetheless, Obstfeld (1982) pointed out that the estimates of Kouri and Porter (1974) and Bean (1976)

were likely to have been overestimates of the o$set coefficient because of the frequent practice of sterilization

- f foreign exchange interventions by central banks. Suppose a country expands the domestic component of
the monetary base; then there would be pressure for the currency to depreciate and the authorities would then
have to buy the domestic currency with a fall in their reserves. To prevent a fall in the money supply, authorities
typically try to sterilize the fall by further purchases of domestic bonds. To the extent that purchasing domestic
bonds (which will tend to lower domestic interest rates) does not induce further outflows, the o$set coefficient
will be greater than minus unity; that is, the expansion of the domestic component of the money base is
greater than the fall in reserves. Since the estimation procedures in the Kouri and Porter and Bean studies did
not take into account sterilization practices, they require re-estimation using more sophisticated econometric
procedures. In his study, Obstfeld (1982) found that the o$set coefficient for Germany changed from –0.55 to
an insigni!cant 0.003 when sterilization practices were accounted for. Obstfeld's result therefore casts grave
doubt on the monetary approach.

All the empirical estimates need to be treated with caution, even if the simultaneous-equation bias problem

has been accounted for by using appropriate econometric estimation techniques. Tis is because all the studies

assume that the price level, real output and interest rates are exogenous and una$ected by changes in the

money supply. Such assumptions have no grounding in economic theory and are most unlikely to be ful!lled

in the real world.

5.14 CRITICISMS OF THE MONETARY APPROACH

We need to emphasize that the monetary model presented in this chapter is not necessarily a model which all

advocates of the monetary approach to the balance of payments would be in full agreement with. Tere is a

wide spectrum of views that can be categorized within the monetarist camp. Some monetarists argue that an

increase in the domestic money supply might not be reflected exclusively in an equivalent fall in the reserves

under !xed exchange rates. For instance, if there is unemployment an expansionary monetary policy may

lead to some increase in output (reflected in a positive-sloping aggregate supply function) which, by raising

money demand, will reduce the devaluation pressures on the home currency. In this instance, reserves would

not need to fall in exact proportion to the initial rise in the money supply as some of the expansion would be

willingly held as transactions balances.

Some critics have argued that to regard the balance of payments as a monetary phenomenon is only true

in the sense that the balance of payments measures monetary flows between domestic and foreign residents.

They argue that it is quite wrong to regard the balance of payments de!cits and surpluses as exclusively due to

monetary decisions because the question of causation is an open issue. If suddenly economic agents decide to

spend more on foreign goods/services and foreign investments under a !xed exchange rate system there will

be a transitory de!cit in the balance of payments. Te de!cit then forces the authorities to buy the domestic

money base in the foreign exchange market. Te cause of the de!cit is the expenditure decision, not a decrease

in money demand which then leads to excess real money balances and a balance of payments de!cit. In other

122

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

words, causation can easily lead from expenditure decisions to changes in money demand rather than changes

in money demand inducing changes in expenditure behaviour.

A survey of the monetary approach by Boughton (1988) argued that nearly every assumption made by the

proponents is empirically open to question. Tere is ample evidence that money demand functions can be

highly unstable, that economies are rarely at full employment and that PPP is useless as a guide to exchange

rate movements (see Chapter 6). Although these assumptions hold reasonably well in the longer run, they

are very rarely ful!lled in the short run. Te empirical violation of these key assumptions must bring into

question the policy relevance of the monetary approach.

Te proponents of the monetary approach argue that it provides an insight into the short-run disequilibrium

in the balance of payments. Yet, since its assumptions of full employment, PPP and a stable money demand

function are highly questionable in the short run, there is clearly something wrong with using assumptions

that may be valid in the long run to explain what is happening in the short run. In this sense, the monetary

model's conclusions about the long-run consequences of changes in economic policy are probably more

insightful than its postulates about the short-run consequences.

Another criticism of the monetary approach is that no attention is paid to the composition of a de!cit and

surplus. If there is a large de!cit in the current account which is !nanced by an o$setting surplus in the capital

account, the monetarists argue that this means that there is no need for any policy concern with regard to

the balance of payments. Indeed, because any surplus or de!cit is necessarily a transitory feature representing

a stock disequilibrium in the money market which is necessarily self-correcting, a policy with regard to

the balance of payments is unnecessary. Such an approach ignores the dangers of increasing indebtedness

due to current account de!cits being !nanced by capital inflows. In the real world it is the increase in such

indebtedness that causes much concern for policy-makers of the countries concerned.

5.15 CONCLUSIONS

Te monetary approach provides a distinctive and clear analysis of the e$ects of a devaluation and monetary

expansion on the balance of payments. Its emphasis on disequilibrium in the balance of payments as being

a flow response to stock disequilibrium in the money market represents an important contribution to the

research on international economics.

Another signi!cant contribution of the monetary approach is that it provides a rich set of policy

recommendations. A country that opts to !x its exchange rate will lose its monetary autonomy and a

monetary expansion will lead to a temporary balance of payments de!cit, whereas a country that allows its

currency to float will have monetary autonomy but a monetary expansion then leads to a depreciation of its

currency. Hence, it provides a warning to policy-makers that reckless monetary expansion can lead to balance

- f payments problems under !xed exchange rates or a currency problem under floating exchange rates.

With regard to the e$ects of a devaluation of a currency, starting from a position of equilibrium, the

monetary approach suggests that there will be an unambiguous transitory surplus in the balance of payments.

Tis stands in contrast to the elasticity and absorption approaches which suggest that the e$ects are ambiguous.

It must be borne in mind, however, that the monetary model is referring to both the current and the capital

account, whereas the latter two are concerned exclusively with the current account. Finally, it needs to be

remembered that the monetary approach does not specify precisely how temporary the resulting surplus is:

presumably this varies on a country by country basis.
