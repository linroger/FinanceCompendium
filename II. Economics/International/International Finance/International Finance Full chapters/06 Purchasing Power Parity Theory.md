6.1 INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 1, we looked at what exactly the foreign exchange market is, introduced a number of di$ering

exchange rate concepts and examined a simple current account model of exchange rate determination. In

this chapter we will look at one of the earliest and simplest models of exchange rate determination known

as purchasing power parity (PPP) theory. An understanding of PPP is essential to the study of international

!nance. PPP theory has been advocated as a satisfactory model of exchange rate determination in its own

right, and provides a point of reference for the long-run exchange rate in many of the modern exchange rate

theories which we will examine in later chapters.

Having looked at PPP theory, we will proceed to examine how well-suited this theory is to explaining

actual exchange rate behaviour since the adoption of generalized floating in 1973. As we shall see, PPP theory

does not provide an adequate explanation of some of the observed features of floating exchange rates. Some of

the possible explanations for the failure of PPP are then discussed.

6.2 PPP THEORY AND THE LAW OF ONE PRICE

PPP is generally attributed to Gustav Cassell's writings in the 1920s, although its intellectual origins date back

to the writings of the nineteenth-century British economist David Ricardo. Te basic concept underlying PPP

theory is that arbitrage forces will lead to the equalization of goods prices internationally, once the prices of

goods are measured in the same currency. As such, the theory represents an application of the 'law of one

price'.

International Finance

_The law of one price_

Te law of one price simply states that, in the presence of a competitive market structure and the absence of

transport costs and other barriers to trade, identical products which are sold in di$erent markets will sell at

the same price when expressed in terms of a common currency.

Te law of one price is based on the idea of perfect goods arbitrage. Arbitrage occurs where economic

agents exploit price di$erences so as to provide a riskless pro!t. For example, if a car costs ¥3,000,000 in

Japan (the domestic economy) and the identical model costs \$30,000 in the USA (the foreign economy),

then according to the law of one price the exchange rate should be ¥3,000,000/\$30,000, which is ¥100/\$1. If

the exchange rate is ¥80/\$1 then a US car would cost a Japanese resident 30,000 × ¥80 = ¥2,400,000 while a

Japanese car would cost US residents 3,000,000/80 = \$37,500, that is, the yen is overvalued. Hence, Japanese

residents will buy US cars (saving ¥600,000), while US residents will not buy Japanese cars, so the yen will

depreciate on the foreign exchange market to its PPP value of ¥100/\$1. Conversely, if the exchange rate were

higher than this, say at ¥120/\$1, then a US car would cost a Japanese resident 30,000 × ¥120 = ¥3,600,000

while a Japanese car would cost US residents 3,000,000/120 = \$25,000, that is, the yen is undervalued. Hence,

Japanese residents will not buy US cars while US residents will buy Japanese cars, so the yen will appreciate on

the foreign exchange market to its PPP value of ¥100/\$1.

Te proponents of PPP argue that the exchange rate must adjust to ensure that the law of one price, which

applies only to individual goods, also holds internationally for identical _bundles_ - f goods.

6.3 ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE PPP

PPP theory comes in two forms: one is based on a strict interpretation of the law of one price and is termed

'absolute PPP', while the other is a 'weaker' variation known as 'relative PPP'. We shall !rst examine the

absolute version of the theory and then consider the relative version.

_Absolute PPP_

Te absolute version of PPP holds that if one takes a bundle of goods in one country and compares the price

- f that bundle with an identical bundle of goods sold in a foreign country, converted by the exchange rate into
a common currency of measurement, then the prices will be equal. For example, if a bundle of goods costs
\$100 in the US (foreign economy) and the same bundle costs ¥10,000 in Japan (domestic economy), then the
exchange rate de!ned as yen per dollar will be ¥10,000/$100 = ¥100/$1. Algebraically, the absolute version of
PPP can be stated as:

_P_

_S_ = (6.1)

_P*_

where _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, _P_ is the price of

a bundle of goods expressed in the domestic currency, and _P_ - is the price of an identical bundle of goods in

the foreign country expressed in terms of the foreign currency.

According to absolute PPP, a rise in the home price level relative to the foreign price level will lead to a

proportional depreciation of the home currency against the foreign currency. In our example, if the price

- f the Japanese bundle rises to ¥12,000 while the price of the US bundle remains at \$100, then according to
absolute PPP the yen will depreciate to ¥120/\$1.

128

Purchasing Power Parity Theory and Floating Exchange Rate Experience

_Relative PPP_

Te absolute version of PPP is, even proponents of the theory generally acknowledge, unlikely to hold precisely

because of the existence of transport costs, imperfect information and the distorting e$ects of tari$ and nontari$ barriers to trade.

Nonetheless, it is argued that a weaker form of PPP known as relative PPP can be expected to hold even

in the presence of such distortions. Put simply, the relative version of PPP theory argues that the exchange

rate will adjust by the amount of the inflation di$erential between two economies. Algebraically this is

expressed as:

%�� _S_ %� _P_           - %� _P_           - (6.2)

where %/ _S_ is the percentage change in the exchange rate, %/ _P_ is the domestic inflation rate, and %/ _P_ - is the

foreign inflation rate.

According to the relative version of PPP, if the inflation rate in Japan is 5% whilst that in the United States

is 2%, the yen exchange rate should be expected to depreciate by approximately 3% against the dollar. Te

absolute version of PPP does not have to hold for this to be the case. For example, the exchange rate may be

¥100/\$1 while the Japanese bundle of goods costs ¥12,000 and the US bundle of identical goods costs \$100, so

that absolute PPP does not hold (this requires a rate of ¥120/\$1). But if Japanese prices go up 5% to ¥12,600

and the US bundle goes up 2% to \$102, the relative version of PPP predicts the yen will depreciate 3% to

¥103/\$1 (even though absolute PPP requires ¥123.53/$1 = ¥12,600/$102).

6.4 A GENERALIZED VERSION OF PPP

One of the major problems with PPP theory, as we have so far examined it, is that it suggests that PPP holds

for all types of goods. However, a more generalized version of PPP that provides some useful insights makes a

distinction between traded and non-traded goods. Traded goods are susceptible to the rigours of international

competition, be they exports or import-competing industries such as most manufactured goods. Non-traded

goods are those that cannot be traded internationally at a pro!t, such as houses and certain services such as a

haircut or restaurant food.

Te point of the traded/non-traded goods distinction is that on _a priori_ grounds PPP is more likely to hold

for traded than for non-traded goods. Tis is because the price of traded goods will tend to be kept in line by

international competition, while the price of non-traded goods will be determined predominately by domestic

supply and demand considerations. For example, if a car costs ¥3,000,000 in Japan and \$30,000 in the USA,

arbitrage will tend to keep the yen–dollar rate at ¥100/\$1. However, if the price of a house costs ¥40,000,000

in Japan and \$250,000 in the USA and the exchange rate is ¥100/\$1, arbitrage forces do not easily come into

play (unless fed-up Japanese citizens emigrate to America pushing up US house prices and lowering Japanese

prices). Similarly, if a haircut costs ¥4,000 in Japan but \$30 in the USA and the exchange rate is ¥100/\$1, then

¥1,000 could be saved, though only insane people in Japan would travel to the USA for a haircut knowing that

they can 'save' ¥1,000, because of the time and transport costs involved.

We will now consider the importance of the tradables/non-tradables distinction for PPP when aggregate

price indices are made up of both tradables and non-tradables. In the !rst instance, we assume that PPP holds

for tradable goods, which means:

_P_ T = _S P_ T* (6.3)

129

International Finance

where _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, _P_ T is the price

- f traded goods in the domestic country measured in terms of the domestic currency, and _P_ T* is the price of
traded goods in the foreign country measured in terms of the foreign currency.

Te aggregate price index ( _P_ I) for the domestic economy is made up of a weighted average of the price

- f both tradable ( _P_ T) and non-tradable goods ( _P_ N), priced in the domestic currency. Likewise, the foreign
aggregate price index ( _P_ I*) is made up of a weighted average of the price on tradables ( _P_ T*) and non-tradables
( _P_ N*), priced in the foreign currency. Tis gives:

_P_ I _P_ N (1 ) _P_ T (6.4)

where * is the proportion of non-traded goods in the domestic price index; and

_P_ I* _P_ N* (1 ) _P_ T* (6.5)

where * is the proportion of non-traded goods in the foreign price index.

Dividing equation (6.4) by (6.5) we obtain:

_P_ I

 - _P_ N* - (1 - �)

_P_ N - (1 - �) _P_ T

If we divide the numerator by _P_ T and the denominator by _SP_ T* which, because of the assumption of PPP for

tradable goods, are equivalent expressions (see equation 6.3) we obtain:

_P_ I - ( _P_ N / _P_ T

Tis can be rearranged to give the solution for the exchange rate as:

- _P_ I - [�] ( _P_ N* / _P_ T* - (1 - �

Equation (6.8) is an important modi!cation to our simple PPP equation, because PPP no longer necessarily

holds in terms of aggregate price indices due to the multiplicative term on the right-hand side. Furthermore,

the equation suggests that the relative price of non-tradables relative to tradables will influence the exchange

rate. If the domestic price of non-tradables rises relative to tradables this will lead to an appreciation (fall) of

the home currency. Te reason is that PPP holds only in terms of tradable goods. A rise in the relative price of

non-tradables, while keeping the aggregate price index constant, implies that the price of tradables must have

fallen, which will then induce an appreciation of the exchange rate (to maintain PPP for tradable goods) even

though the aggregate price index has remained unchanged. Conversely, a rise in the price of tradables, while

holding the aggregate price index constant, leads to a depreciation of the exchange rate to maintain PPP for

tradable goods.

130

Purchasing Power Parity Theory and Floating Exchange Rate Experience

Te tradable/non-tradable distinction serves as a warning when testing for PPP. Testing for PPP using

price indices based on tradable goods prices is likely to lead to better results than when using aggregate price

indices made up of both types of goods. Exchange rate movements induced by changes in the relative prices

between tradable and non-tradable goods represent real exchange rate changes. Among the factors that can

lead to such relative price changes are di$ering rates of productivity in the traded and non-traded sectors of

the economy, and changing consumer demand patterns.

6.5 MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS IN TESTING FOR PPP

Many of the proponents of PPP argued prior to the adoption of floating exchange rates that exchange rate

changes would be in line with levels predicted by PPP theory. Before examining some of the empirical evidence

- n PPP theory, it is worth considering some of the practical problems involved in testing for PPP. One of the
major problems is to decide whether or not the theory is supposed to be applicable to both traded goods and
non-traded goods, or applicable to only one of those categories. At !rst sight PPP theory seems more readily
applicable to traded goods, but some authors have argued that the distinction between the two categories is
fuzzy and that there are mechanisms linking both traded and non-traded goods prices. For example, some
traded goods are used as inputs into the production of non-traded goods, and vice versa (for example, shop
rents di$er in price from the USA compared to, say, Mexico).

Te argument over whether PPP should be applied to traded goods only, or whether a more general

price index made up of both traded and non-traded goods should be used, is important for the empirical

testing of PPP theory. If the theory is supposed to be applicable to traded goods only, then the price index

used for testing the theory needs to be made up only of traded goods. Conversely, if the theory is applicable

to both traded and non-traded goods then a more general price index should be employed. In practice,

researchers who test PPP theory for traded goods typically use wholesale or manufacturing price indices

which are normally dominated by traded goods, while if the test involves both traded and non-traded goods

then consumer price indices which weight both classes of goods are generally used. An overall problem

facing researchers, whichever price index they decide to employ, is that PPP is only expected to hold for

similar baskets of goods, but national price indices typically attach di$erent weights to di$erent classes of

goods. For instance, consumer price indices in underdeveloped economies typically have a high weighting

for food, while those in developed countries have a lower weighting for food and a higher weighting for

consumer goods.

Another statistical problem in testing for PPP is that the base period for the test should ideally be one

where PPP holds approximately. In addition, there are divergences of view over the time span during which

PPP can be expected to assert itself: a strong version of PPP would suggest it holds on a monthly basis,

whereas progressively weaker versions would argue that it can be expected to hold only on a quarterly, sixmonthly or yearly and beyond basis. Bearing in mind some of these practical problems, we will proceed to

look at some of the empirical evidence for PPP theory.

6.6 EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON PPP

Tere are a variety of methods of testing for PPP, including graphical evidence, simplistic data analysis and

more sophisticated econometric evidence. We !rst look at the graphical evidence.

131

International Finance

_Graphical evidence on PPP_

Figure 6.1 plots the actual exchange rate and the exchange rate that would have maintained PPP, for various

currencies, and shows that the exchange rate has diverged considerably from that suggested by purchasing

power parity.

In Figure 6.1(a) it can be seen that PPP does not do at all well in tracking the dollar–pound rate – it

performs reasonably well up to 1977 but between mid-1976 and mid-1981 there is a dramatic appreciation

- f the pound, while PPP would have predicted a depreciation (due to higher UK inflation). A massive dollar
appreciation a,er 1981 leads to the restoration of PPP in early 1984. Terea,er the pound was mainly

- vervalued, especially in the run up to the global !nancial crisis, which resulted in a rapid depreciation of the
pound. Following the Brexit referendum there was a period of undervaluation in relation to PPP but by late
2020 the pound was close to its PPP rate. Neither is the Deutschmark–dollar rate (Figure 6.1(b)) explained by
PPP, with the dollar generally undervalued in relation to PPP up to early 1981. Terea,er the dollar becomes
substantially overvalued in relation to PPP up until mid-1986 when it once again becomes undervalued in
relation to PPP. However, taking a long-run view PPP seems to have worked with the exchange rate by late
2020 in line with what had been predicted by PPP in 1973. Again, with the yen–dollar (Figure 6.1(c)) there
are sustained and marked departures from PPP using 1973 as the starting point; nonetheless if 1976 was used
as the starting point the !t would be a lot better and the relatively higher inflation in the US has clearly been
associated with a depreciation of the US dollar.

When it comes to tracking the French franc, Italian ira to the Deutschmark and Deutschmark pound

rate (Figures 6.1 (d-f)) the plots reveal that, although there are deviations from PPP, the order of magnitude

is much smaller than against the dollar and that PPP does a reasonable job. Tis is not that surprising since

transport costs and trade barriers between France, Italy, the UK and Germany are small because of their

geographical proximity, and membership of the European Union (up until the end of the transition period

January 2021 in the case of the UK) prohibits the use of trade barriers between its members. Tese conditions

facilitate the goods-market arbitrage that PPP is so heavily dependent on.

Figure 6.1(g) depicts the evolution of the dollar–euro parity which has shown very substantial and

persistent departures from PPP since the euro commenced trading in the foreign exchange market in January

1999. In the !rst three years there was a substantial depreciation of the euro and periods of undervaluation in

relation to PPP, and since 2002, a substantial appreciation of the euro and tendency to large overvaluation of

the euro in relation to PPP.

It is noticeable in all the plots that, although the exchange rate is frequently far from PPP, it does have a

tendency to go back towards the PPP rate over the longer run. Tis provides some evidence that PPP may be

a useful guide for the determination of the long-run exchange rate.

_Econometric evidence on PPP_

Apart from comparing the exchange rate that would have maintained PPP with the actual exchange rate, we

can test for PPP by use of regression analysis. In log form the two simple hypotheses may be expressed as

follows:

Absolute PPP: ln _S_ t = _a_ 1 + _a_ 2(ln _P_ t – ln _P_ t*) + _u_ t

Relative PPP: /ln _S_ t = _a_ 1 + _a_ 2(/ln _P_ t – /ln _P_ t*) + _u_ t

where / is the one-period change in the variable, ln _S_ t is the log of the domestic exchange rate per unit of

foreign currency, ln _P_ t is the log of domestic tradable goods prices, ln _P_ t* is the log of foreign tradable goods

prices, and _u_ t is a random error with zero mean and normal distribution.

In both cases, for PPP to hold, the regression estimates would yield _a_ 1 = 0 and _a_ 2 = 1. Te price and exchange

rate variables are put into log form because the change in the log of a variable approximates to the percentage

change in the variable. Table 6.1 contains some up-to-date empirical estimates of the relative version of PPP

using quarterly data for the period 1973Q1 to 2020Q3 for a variety of currencies (having the system in !rstdi$erence form makes the validity of the test somewhat superior as it has the e$etc of detrending the data).

Te regressions recreate the old Deutschmark, French franc and Italian lira by using their !xed exchange rates

against the euro for the period from 1 January 1999.

Te regression estimates provide additional support for the graphical analysis in the case of the relative

PPP version. For the pound–dollar rate the coefficient _a_ 2 is wrongly signed and statistically insigni!cant. For

the dollar–Deutschmark the coefficient _a_ 2 is well below the hypothesized value of unity and is not signi!cantly

di$erent from zero, leading to a clear rejection of PPP. PPP does not help much with the yen–dollar rate either:

in the two sub-periods the coefficient _a_ 2 is negative and not signi!cantly di$erent from zero for the full sample

and sub-sample periods. For the the entire period PPP does somewhat better for the lira–dollar rate and the

sub-period 1973Q1 to 1996Q2. European country currencies seem to perform better in PPP tests against the

Deutschmark than they do against the dollar.

Te overall evidence on the PPP hypothesis is not very supportive: the graphical evidence and econometric

results show that for some rates the deviations from PPP are both substantial and prolonged. Tis is especially

the case for the major currencies against the US dollar, where PPP performs abysmally. While PPP has a

better explanatory power for a number of currencies against the Deutschmark, the results are still not that

supportive, as the estimates for the coefficient a2 can di$er substantially in the sub-periods and are o,en not

signi!cantly di$erent from zero. In summary, there is much more to exchange rate determination than PPP.

For an excellent review of the literature on PPP the reader is referred to Sarno and Taylor (2002).

6.7 SUMMARY OF THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR PPP

1. Our results are very much in line with those presented by Frenkel (1981) that show PPP performs

better for countries that are geographically close to one another and where trade linkages are high.

Tis is also borne out in the graphical plots – the biggest divergences between the actual and PPP

exchange rates are between the pound, Deutschmark and yen against the dollar; while the lira and

French franc rates against the Deutschmark are quite accurately tracked by PPP. Not only are France,

Italy and Germany in close proximity to one another, so minimizing transport costs, but they are also

members of the European Union in which there exist no tari$ impediments to restrict trade among

them.

2. Te plots of the exchange rates and PPP rates show that there have been both substantial and

prolonged deviations from PPP which have frequently been reversed.

3. Exchange rates have been much more volatile than the corresponding national price levels (see

Frenkel and Mussa, 1980; MacDonald, 1988). Tis again is contrary to the PPP hypothesis in which

exchange rates are only supposed to be as volatile as prices. Figure 6.2 shows that the monthly

volatility of the $/£ exchange rate is signi!cantly higher than the di$erence in the monthly changes in

the US and UK price indices.

4. Empirically, PPP holds better in the long run than in the short run. A study by Lothian (1997) using

data from 22 OECD countries covering the period 1974–91 found that, although there have been

substantial and prolonged short-run deviations from relative PPP, it cannot be rejected over the

longer run being between three and six years. Tis long-run validity of PPP has also been supported

by Sarno and Taylor (2002) using the latest econometric techniques. Further support for the long-run

validity of relative PPP is obtained using panel data techniques for 19 industrial and 26 developing

countries by Coakley et al. (2005).

Te currencies of countries that had very high inflation rates relative to trading partners, such as

Israel, Brazil and Argentina in the 1980s, experienced rapid depreciations reflecting their relatively

high inflation rates. Tis suggests that PPP was the dominant force in determining their exchange

rates during that period.

6. Overall, PPP holds better for traded goods than for non-traded goods, and this is con!rmed in a

study by Officer (1986). In addition, a striking and major empirical regularity is that the price of nontraded goods tends to be more expensive in rich countries than in poor countries, once prices are

converted into a common currency. We will investigate this phenomenon further in section 6.10, as

well as the important implications about how we measure per capita GDP.

7. A number of papers have estimated the half-life of corrections of deviations from PPP. Te half-life

is the time it takes in years to correct 50% of a deviation from PPP. In an influential paper by Rogo$

(1996), this was estimated to be three to !ve years. Tis shows that deviations from PPP are not

speedily corrected. Rogo$ (1996, p. 647) refers to the 'PPP puzzle': 'the purchasing power puzzle

is this. How can one reconcile the enormous short-run volatility of real exchange rates with the

extremely slow rate at which shocks appear to damp out?' However, Sarno and Taylor (2002) dispute

the validity of the half-lives reported by Rogo$ in the case of large deviations from PPP, which they

argue are far more speedily corrected.

8. A study by Xu (2003) emphasizes the importance of using the correct price index in PPP tests. PPP

is much less likely to hold if one uses consumer price indices (CPI), than if wholesale price indices

(WPI) are used. Signi!cantly better is the use of a tradables price index (TPI). In his study Xu

estimates the half-life of deviations from PPP to be somewhat lower than Rogo$'s three to !ve years;

he calculates the half-life to be around two years if CPI or WPI indices are used, and as low as one

year if a TPI index is used.

**Box 6.1 The hamburger standard**

In 1986, _Te Economist_ magazine launched a 'Big Mac index'. Te 'McDonald standard' is based upon

the concept of PPP, the price index for measuring PPP being simply the price of a Big Mac hamburger.

In January 2020 the average price of a Big Mac in the USA was \$5.71 and in Switzerland it was 6.50 Swiss

francs. Dividing the Swiss franc price by the US dollar price yields an implied PPP of approximately 1.14

Swiss francs per dollar compared with an actual exchange rate of 0.94 Swiss francs per dollar, yielding

a 21.3% overvaluation of the Swiss franc. Table 6.2 presents the measurements of over/undervaluation

  - f the dollar in terms of PPP against various other currencies using hamburger prices. According to the
table, one of the most undervalued currencies is the Chinese yuan (a Beijing Big Mac costs only \$3.10),
while South Africa’s Rand is the most undervalued currency (a big Mac costs \$1.86).

6.8 EXPLAINING THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF PPP THEORY

Tere have been many explanations put forward to explain the general failure of exchange rates to adjust in

line with PPP theory. We will now proceed to look at some of the most important.

_Statistical problems_

We have seen that PPP theory is based upon the concept of comparing identical baskets of goods in two

economies. An important problem facing researchers in this respect is that di$erent countries usually attach

di$erent weights to various categories of goods and services when constructing their price indices, which

means it is difficult to compare like with like when testing for PPP. Tis factor is probably very signi!cant

when testing for PPP between developed and developing economies which have vastly di$erent consumption

patterns. People in developing countries usually spend a high proportion of their income on basics such as food

and clothing, while these take up a much smaller proportion of people's expenditure in developed economies.

Di$ering consumption baskets are not of such signi!cance when comparing most industrialized economies

since consumers have fairly similar consumption baskets. Tere is, however, a problem posed by the di$ering

quality of goods consumed. Although British and German consumers both spend roughly the same proportion

- f their incomes on cars, the Germans tend to drive German makes like BMW and Audi while the British tend
to drive Fords and Japanese cars which are generally cheaper. We do not necessarily expect PPP to hold in
terms of cars between the two countries because once again we are not comparing like with like.

_Transport costs and trade impediments_

Studies such as Frenkel (1981) which note that PPP holds better when the countries concerned are

geographically close and trade linkages are high can partly be explained by transport costs and the existence

- f other trade impediments such as tari$s. If a bundle of goods costs £100 in the UK and \$200 in the USA,
PPP would suggest an exchange rate of £0.50/\$1. If transport costs are £20 then the exchange rate could
lie anywhere between £0.40/\$1 and £0.60/\$1 without bringing arbitrage forces into play. Nonetheless, since
transport costs and trade barriers do not change dramatically over time they are not sufficient explanations
for the failure of the relative versions of PPP.

_Imperfect competition_

One of the notions underlying PPP is that there is sufficient international competition to prevent major

departures of the price of a good in one country exceeding that in another. However, it is clear that there

are considerable variations in the degree of competition internationally, and these di$erences mean that

multinational corporations can o,en get away with charging di$erent prices in di$erent countries. In fact,

the conditions necessary for successful price discrimination, namely di$erences in the willingness to pay

- f di$erent sets of consumers, the ability to prevent resale from the low-cost to high-cost market and some
degree of monopoly power, are for the most part more likely to hold between rather than within countries.

_Differences between capital and goods markets_

PPP is based upon the concept of goods arbitrage and has nothing to say about the role of capital movements.

In a classic paper which we shall be looking at in more detail in Chapter 7, Rüdiger Dornbusch (1976)

hypothesized that, in a world where capital markets are highly integrated and goods markets exhibit slow

142

Purchasing Power Parity Theory and Floating Exchange Rate Experience

price adjustment, there can be substantial prolonged deviations of the exchange rate from PPP. Te basic idea

is that in the short run goods prices in both the home and foreign economies can be considered as !xed, while

the exchange rate adjusts quickly to new information and changes in economic policy. Tis being the case,

exchange rate changes represent deviations from PPP which can be quite substantial and prolonged.

_Productivity differentials_

As mentioned, one striking empirical observation that is well documented is that when prices of similar

baskets of both traded and non-traded goods are converted into a common currency, the aggregate price

indices tend to be higher in rich countries than in poor countries. In other words, a dollar buys more goods

in, say, Mexico than in the United States. Further, evidence shows that prices of tradable goods are nowhere

as dissimilar internationally as those of non-traded goods. Consequently the overall higher price index in rich

countries is mainly due to the fact that non-tradable goods prices are higher in developed than developing

countries.

An explanation for the lower relative price of non-tradables in poor countries has been put forward

separately by Bela Balassa (1964) and Paul Samuelson (1964). Tis is worth considering in detail. As we shall

see, the model argues that the lower price of goods in the non-traded sector in developing countries is mainly

due to lower labour productivity in the tradables sector compared to developed countries. Or, equivalently,

the higher price of non-traded goods in a developed nation (compared to non-traded goods in the developing

country) is mainly due to higher labour productivity in the traded sector compared to labour productivity in

the tradables sector of developing countries.

6.9 THE BALASSA–SAMUELSON MODEL

Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) argue that labour productivity in rich countries is higher than that in

poor countries. Furthermore, this productivity di$erential occurs predominately in the tradables rather than

the non-tradables sector. A Mexican barber tends to be as efficient as his American counterpart (as measured

by haircuts per day), but a Mexican car worker is less efficient than his American counterpart (as measured by

cars produced per day). Wages are assumed to be the same in the tradables and non-tradables sectors within

each economy and positively related to productivity. Prices are determined positively by wages and inversely

by productivity. Tese assumptions lead to the following set of relationships:

In the poor country:

_P_ N _= W_ N _/Q_ N and _P_ T _= W_ T _/Q_ T (6.9)

In the rich economy:

_P_ N* = _W_ N*/ _Q_ N* and _P_ T* = _W_ T*/ _Q_ T* (6.10)

where _P_ N represents non-tradables prices, _P_ T represents traded goods prices, _Q_ N is output per worker in the

tradables sector, _Q_ T is output per worker in the non-tradables sector, and an asterisk denotes a high income

(high productivity) economy.

Wage rates are the same in both the industries in each of the two economies:

_W_ N _= W_ T and _W_ N _* = W_ T _*_ (6.11)

143

International Finance

Productivity is higher in the rich economy's tradables sector than in the poor country's, but in the nontradables sector productivity in the rich and poor countries are the same. Tis means that:

_Q_ T _* > Q_ T and _Q_ N _* = Q_ N (6.12)

Finally, PPP is assumed to hold only for traded goods:

_S_ = _P_ T/ _P_ T* (6.13)

Te price ratio of traded to non-traded goods in each country is given by:

_P_ N

_P_

N

- � (6.14)

T

and

_P_

N* 

_P_ T*

- � - (6.15)

Since there is higher productivity in the rich economy's tradables sector, then the relative price of nontradables to tradables will be higher in the rich country, making 0* > 0.

Rewriting equations (6.14) and (6.15) as:

_P_ N

_P_

N

- � (6.16)

T

and

_SP_ N*

- �* (6.17)
  - �*

_SPT_ 

Since PPP holds for the tradables sector, making _P_ T = _SP_ T*, then the denominator of equations (6.16) and

(6.17) are the same. Consequently, since 0* > 0, the price of non-tradables in the rich economy exceeds the

price of non-tradables in the developing country, that is, _SP_ N* > _P_ N; i.e., PPP does not work for non-traded

goods. Te reason is that low wages in the developing country, due to low productivity in its traded sector, also

lead to a relatively low price for its non-traded goods even though its productivity in this sector is the same

as in developed countries. On the other hand, high productivity in the rich country's tradables sector leads

to high wages in its non-tradables sector, even though it is no more efficient than the poor country in that

sector. Consequently, when we use the exchange rate to examine non-tradable goods prices we !nd that they

are higher in developed countries than in developing ones.

Te Balassa–Samuelson model is helpful in explaining why it is that rich countries tend to have overall

high price indices and poor countries have low price indices when aggregate baskets of traded and nontraded goods are converted into a common currency such as the US dollar. Furthermore, it helps explain

why the ratio of non-traded to traded prices tends to be higher in developed economies than in developing

countries.

144

Purchasing Power Parity Theory and Floating Exchange Rate Experience

It is clear that PPP based on tradable goods alone will undervalue the purchasing power and living standards

- f people in poor countries because they can purchase more non-traded goods per dollar than can people in
rich countries, even if PPP holds for traded goods (see section 6.10). Tis means that when comparing per
capita income levels between countries such as Mexico and the United States in dollar terms this should not
be done at the PPP rate for tradable goods; rather, the proportion of Mexican expenditure on non-tradables
should be valued at US non-tradables prices, thereby raising the value of Mexican incomes in US dollar terms.

Te productivity di$erential theory may also have some application in explaining divergences from PPP

in terms of aggregate price indices between developed countries. For instance, since the Second World War

Japan has consistently had higher productivity in its tradables sector than the United States. According to the

Balassa–Samuelson model, this means that the real value of the yen should appreciate against the dollar as

the higher productivity of Japanese tradables workers leads to a fall in Japanese traded goods prices relative to

US traded goods prices and therefore an appreciation of the yen to maintain PPP for tradable goods. Richard

Marston (1986) found evidence that in the period 1973–83, Japanese productivity growth in its tradables

sector outstripped US tradables productivity. During that period the yen appreciated by some 9% in real terms

against the dollar.

Although the Balassa–Samuelson model helps explain why PPP does not necessarily hold in terms of

aggregate price indices, it is only a partial explanation. By assumption the theory cannot explain the failure of

PPP to hold for traded goods.

6.10 PER CAPITA INCOME LEVELS, THE RELATIVE SIZES OF ECONOMIES AND THE

IMPORTANCE OF PPP ESTIMATES

Te World Bank keeps a very keen eye on the per capita income levels of developing countries, since the

poorest countries in the world are o,en deemed to be the countries that policy-makers wish to direct aid

towards and provide access to cheap !nance for developmental purposes. Te fact that PPP tends not to

hold, especially between developed and developing nations, is of considerable importance in this respect. It

is well documented that, in particular, the price of non-tradable goods and services in developing countries

is signi!cantly lower than in developed countries. Tis means that \$100 will tend to buy far more haircuts,

restaurant meals, hotel time and many other goods and services when transferred into the local currency of

a developing country than in a developed nation like the United States, the United Kingdom or Japan, simply

because PPP does not hold. In particular, the exchange rates of developing countries tend to be noticeably

undervalued in terms of purchasing power for goods and services. Consider the case of the Chinese renminbi

versus the US dollar: the market exchange rate in March 2021 was approximately 6.50 renminbi per US dollar.

Imagine, however, that when we change \$100 into renminbi to obtain 650 renminbi we are then able to make

66% more goods and services in China than in the USA. Te appropriate PPP exchange rate in terms of goods

and services would then be 6.50/1.66 = 3.90 renminbi per dollar. If the exchange rate was at the calculated PPP

rate then \$100 would convert to 390 renminbi which would purchase the same bundle of goods and services

in China as \$100 buys in the USA. Tink now of the implications for calculations of GDP per capita. If the

United States GDP per capita was \$65,000 while the Chinese per capita income was 65,000 renminbi, then,

using the market exchange rate (6.5RMB/\$1), the Chinese income per capita would only be \$10,000 which is a

mere 15.4% of that of the United States. However, if \$10,000 buys 66% more goods and services in China, then

we need to multiply the Chinese income by 1.66 to get a PPP per capita income, which is \$16,600 (the same

as dividing the Chinese GDP per capita of 65,000 renminbi by the PPP rate of 3.90). Tis would suggest that

Chinese income levels are closer to 25.5% of those of the United States. Te GDP per capita based on PPP is

therefore a more reliable guide (albeit highly imperfect!) to relative living standards in the two countries than

using the market exchange rate which does not reflect PPP.

Te previous example calculation is by no means far from reality in the case of the United States and

China. Table 6.3 shows gross national income (GDP) per capita according to the World Bank using both the

Atlas method and the PPP method. Te Atlas method mainly uses an average of market exchange rates over

the past three years to calculate income per capita in terms of US dollars, making some allowance for recent

inflation (this methodology helps to iron out sudden changes in relative !gures due merely to large year-toyear exchange rate changes compared to using purely current market exchange rates), and these are compared

to the estimates of GDP per capita using PPP estimates.

Not only do PPP adjustments make a signi!cant di$erence to GDP per capita estimates, they also make

a big di$erence to the importance of the relative size of di$erent economies. As Table 6.4 shows, the largest

economy in 2019 using market exchange rates was the United States with China second, measuring at 66.9%

- f the size of the US economy, and India !,h. If, however, we measure the relative sizes of economies based
upon PPP exchange rate estimates then China becomes the largest economy in the world. China's GDP is now
9.5% larger than the size of the US economy, with India jumping from !,h to becoming the world's third
biggest economy!

6.11 CONCLUSIONS

At the time of the adoption of floating exchange rates it was widely believed that they would adjust in line with

changes in national price levels as predicted by PPP theory. However, the experience with floating rates has

shown that there can be substantial and prolonged deviations of exchange rates from PPP. A clear conclusion

is that, in the short to medium term, international goods arbitrage is nowhere near as powerful as proponents

- f PPP had presupposed.

Tere are many possible explanations for these deviations from PPP. Among the strongest candidates is

that the theory relies too heavily on goods arbitrage and has no role for the international capital movements

which have grown enormously in scale since the end of the Second World War. Such capital movements are

heavily influenced by prospective returns and therefore agents' expectations about the future. As expectations

change, then so will exchange rates regardless of whether goods prices are changing. In the following chapters

we shall be looking at some of the most recent theories that attempt to take into account the implications of

such capital movements.

Nonetheless, the fact that PPP does not hold very well in the short to medium term does not mean that it

has no role to play in exchange rate determination. Overor undervaluation of currencies in relation to PPP

induce changes in current-account positions which will eventually lead to exchange rate changes. It is the case

that deviations from PPP do have a habit of reversing themselves over the longer run. Furthermore, although

exchange rates may diverge substantially from PPP, if the break in this link becomes too large the forces of

goods arbitrage do start to come into play and move the exchange rate towards its PPP value. More recent

evidence shows that PPP may be a useful guide to the long-run exchange rate and should not therefore be

abandoned altogether.
