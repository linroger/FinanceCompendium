7.1 INTRODUCTION

Te PPP theory outlined in Chapter 6 is far from a satisfactory explanation of observed exchange rate behaviour.

In particular, it is very much concerned with goods arbitrage and has nothing to say about capital movements

internationally. During the post-Second World War era there has been an enormous growth of capital markets,

meaning that it is possible for international investors to switch huge amounts of money out of one currency

into another very speedily. Tis being the case, speculators will tend to move their money between currencies

based on the expected rate of return of one currency compared to another. What people expect to happen

to the exchange rate will be a crucial part in determining which currencies to buy and sell%– if a currency is

expected to depreciate, then agents will tend to switch out of that currency and into those currencies that they

expect to appreciate. In this chapter, we will look at some more recent and sophisticated exchange rate models

that have been developed in an attempt to model exchange rate behaviour more successfully.

Te common thread to the models that we will analyse in this chapter is that they all emphasize the

important role of relative money supplies in explaining the exchange rate. Te monetary models start from

the observation that the exchange rate is the price of one money in terms of another. However, the monetary

International Finance

models go beyond this simple observation to argue that exchange rate movements can be explained by changes

in the supply and demand for national money stocks. Tere are a variety of models put forward by monetarists

to explain exchange rate behaviour and we will deal with three of the most important versions in this chapter:

the 'flexible-price' monetary model, the 'sticky-price' monetary model and the 'real-interest-rate-di$erential’

model. Tese models make an assumption that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes; and there

has developed a brand of models known as portfolio balance models that allow for di$erences in riskiness

between domestic and foreign bonds. We shall spend some time looking at the implications of imperfect asset

substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds through a more general model that allows for a portfolio

balance e$etc.

7.2 UNCOVERED INTEREST RATE PARITY

Since international investors can quickly and easily switch out of domestic bonds into foreign bonds and vice

versa, the exchange rate can be viewed as a relative asset price. Te fundamental characteristic of an asset

price is that its present value will be largely influenced by its expected rate of return. Imagine the case of an

international investor who has the option of investing his or her money in euro denominated bonds or US

bonds of similar risk and maturity. If he or she regards the bonds as equally risky and can switch between

the two assets instantaneously, the only di$erence between the bonds is their currency of denomination and

possibly the interest rate attached to them. Tere will be two factors that international investors will bear in

mind when considering which to purchase: the rates of interest on eurozone bonds and US bonds, and what

they expect to happen to the dollar per euro exchange rate. We can write that:



_Es_                    - _rus_                    - _reu_ (7.1)

where _Es_ ˙ is the expected rate of depreciation of the exchange rate of the dollar, de!ned as dollars per euro, _r_ us

is the US interest rate and _r_ is the eurozone interest rate.

eu

Equation (7.1) is known as the uncovered interest parity condition (UIP). UIP states that the expected rate

- f depreciation of the dollar against the euro is equal to the interest rate di$erential between US dollar and
euro denominated bonds. For example, if the interest rate in the US is 7% per annum while the interest rate
in the eurozone is 2% per annum, then on average international investors expect the dollar to depreciate by
5% per annum.

With an initial dollar per euro exchange rate of \$1.20/€1, investing \$1,000 in US bonds will yield the

investor \$70 return (7%) at the end of the year. If he expects the dollar to depreciate by 5% during the year,

he expects the dollar–euro exchange rate to be \$1.26/€1. Hence, he could purchase \$1,000 worth of euros

today at \$1.20/€1 which gives him €833.33 and which will earn the euro interest rate of 2%, meaning he will

then have €850 which he expects to convert back into dollars at \$1.26/€1 giving him \$1,071. Tis implies an

expected return of \$71 (i.e. 7.1% or approximately 7%) from investing in euro bonds, which is approximately

equal to the expected return on US bonds. Hence, the UIP condition implies that the expected rate of return

- n domestic and foreign bonds are equal.

If the expected rate of depreciation of the dollar is 5% then according to UIP the US interest rate will have

to be 5% higher than the eurozone interest rate to ensure the equalization of expected yields on US and EU

bonds. Crucially, for the UIP condition to hold continuously requires that capital is _perfectly mobile_ so that

investors can instantly alter the composition of their international investments. In addition, they have to

150

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

regard US and EU bonds as equally risky – were this not the case then investors that are risk-averse would

require a higher expected return on the riskier asset. For example, if risk-averse US investors viewed the risk

- n EU bonds as being greater than the risk on US bonds, they would require a higher expected rate of return
- n EU bonds than US bonds so that the UIP condition no longer holds.

When there is both perfect capital mobility and equal riskiness of domestic and foreign bonds, US and EU

bonds are said to be _perfect substitutes_ . Perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign bonds implies that the

UIP condition will hold on a continuous basis. Te monetarist models that we examine in this chapter make

a crucial assumption that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes.

7.3 THE MONETARY MODELS OF EXCHANGE RATE DETERMINATION

Having provided the basic background to the monetary models of exchange rate determination we now

proceed to examine the speci!c characteristics and predictions of three of the major monetarist models of

exchange rate determination. Tese are commonly termed the 'flexible-price', 'sticky-price' and 'real-interestrate-di$erential' monetary models. A common characteristic of these models is that the supply and demand

for money are the key determinants of exchange rates.

Another common starting point is that all the models employ the UIP condition; that is, they assume that

domestic and foreign bonds are equally risky so that their expected rates of returns are equalized.

Beyond this similarity there are some signi!cant di$erences between the models. Te flexible-price

monetary model argues that all prices in the economy, be they wages, prices or exchange rates, are perfectly

flexible both upwards and downwards in both the short and the long run. It also incorporates a role for the

e$etc of inflationary expectations. Te sticky-price model, !rst elaborated by Rüdiger Dornbusch (1976a), is

a monetary model that argues that in the short run wages and prices tend to be sticky and only the exchange

rate changes in response to changes in economic policy. Only in the medium to long run do wages and

prices adjust to changes in economic policy and economic shocks. In the Dornbusch model, inflationary

expectations are not explicitly dealt with. Te real-interest-rate-di$erential model combines the role of

inflationary expectations of the flexible-price monetary model with the sticky prices of the Dornbusch model.

**Box 7.1 The UIP condition and changes in exchange rate expectations**

According to the UIP condition, changes in the future expected exchange rate can exert a signi!cant

e$ect on the spot exchange rate. In Figure 7.1 we illustrate the UIP condition for the dollar–euro

parity. Te spot exchange rate is assumed to be \$1.20/€1, the US interest rate is 7% per annum and the

euro interest rate is 2% per annum. According to the UIP condition the dollar should be expected to

depreciate by 5% per annum, that is, to $1.20 × 1.05 = $1.26/€1. In Figure 7.1(a) the expected year-end

total is \$1070 regardless of whether the money is le, in dollars or converted into €833.33 spot, which

becomes €850 and is expected to be converted back at the end of the year at €850 × $1.26/€1 = $1071.

An interesting question concerns what would happen if, for some reason, there is some bad

economic news or adverse market sentiment against the dollar that, while leaving euro and US interest

rates unchanged, leads market participants to change their view of the expected future exchange rate of

the dollar per euro parity from $1.26/€1 to, say, $1.35/€1. Te answer is shown in Figure 7.1(b). Clearly

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

7.4 THE FLEXIBLE-PRICE MONETARY MODEL

Te flexible-price monetary model was developed by Frenkel (1976), Mussa (1976) and Bilson (1978a and

1978b) and assumes that PPP holds continuously. It represents a valuable addition to exchange rate theory

because it explicitly introduces relative money stocks into the picture as determinants of the relative prices

which in turn determine the exchange rate.

We start by assuming that there is a conventional money demand function given by:

_m_            - _p_            - � _y_            - � _r_ (7.2)

where _m_ is the log of the domestic money stock, _p_ is the log of the domestic price level, _y_ is the log of domestic

real income and _r_ is the nominal domestic interest rate.

Equation (7.2) says that the demand to hold real money balances is positively related to real domestic

income, due to increased transactions demand, and inversely related to the domestic interest rate. A similar

relationship holds for the foreign money demand function which is given by:

_m_           - � _p_           -           - � _y_           -           -           - _r_           - (7.3)

where _m_ - is the log of the foreign nominal money stock, _p_ - is the log of the foreign price level, _y_ - is the log of

the foreign real income and _r_ - is the foreign interest rate.

It is assumed that PPP holds continuously, expressed as:

_s_ = _p_                                 - _p_                                 - (7.4)

where _s_ is the log of the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency.

Te monetarist models make a crucial assumption that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes.

Tis being the case, the uncovered interest parity condition holds:

_Es_                     - � _r_ _r_                    - (7.5)

where _Es_ ˙ is the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency. Equation (7.5) says that the expected rate

- f depreciation of the home currency is equal to the interest rate di$erential between domestic and foreign
bonds.

We can rearrange equations (7.2) and (7.3) to give solutions for the domestic and foreign price levels:

_p_                 - _m_                 -                 - _y_                 -                 - _r_ (7.6)

_p_                -                - _m_                -                -                - _y_                -                - � _r_                - (7.7)

We then substitute equations (7.6) and (7.7) into equation (7.4) to obtain:

_s_                 - ( _m_                 - _m_ *)                 -                 - ( _y_                 - _y_ *)                 -                 - ( _r_                 - _r_ *) (7.8)

153

International Finance

Equation (7.8) is what is known as a 'reduced-form' exchange rate equation. Te spot exchange rate (the

dependent variable) on the le,-hand side is determined by the variables (explanatory variables) listed on the

right-hand side of the equation.

Equation (7.8) predicts the following concerning the e$etc of a change in one of the right-hand variables

- n the exchange rate:

1. **Relative money supplies affect exchange rates:** a given percentage increase in the home money

supply leads to an exactly equivalent depreciation of the currency, while a given percentage increase

in the foreign money supply leads to an exactly equivalent percentage appreciation of the domestic

currency. Te rationale behind this is that a 10% increase in the home money supply leads to an

immediate 10% increase in prices, and because PPP holds continuously this also implies a 10%

depreciation of the currency. Conversely, a 10% increase in the foreign money supply leads to a 10%

rise in foreign prices and for PPP to hold this means the domestic currency appreciates 10%.

2. **Relative levels of national income influence exchange rates:** if domestic income were to rise, this

increases the transactions demand for money, and the increased demand for money means that if

the money stock and interest rates are held constant the increased demand for real balances can only

come about through a fall in domestic prices (see equation 7.2). Te fall in domestic prices then

requires an appreciation of the currency to maintain PPP. On the other hand, an increase in foreign

income leads to a fall in the foreign price level and therefore a depreciation of the home currency to

maintain PPP.

3. an increase in the domestic interest rate leads to a
**Relative interest rates affect exchange rates:**

depreciation of the domestic currency. Te rationale behind this is that a rise in the domestic interest

rate leads to a fall in the demand for money and hence a depreciation of the domestic currency.

Another rationalization for this e$etc can be made by expressing the nominal interest rate as made up

    - f two components, the real interest rate and the expected inflation rate; that is:

_r_ = _i_ + _Pe_ ˙

where _i_ is the real rate of interest and _Pė_

is the expected rate of price inflation. Similarly the foreign

nominal interest rate is given by:

_r* = i* + Pė*_

Assuming that the real rate of interest is constant and identical in both countries ( _i_ = _i_ *), an increase in

the domestic nominal interest rate is due to an increase in domestic price inflation expectations. Such

increased inflation expectations lead to a decreased demand for money and an increased expenditure

    - n goods, which in turn leads to a rise in domestic prices. Te rise in domestic prices then requires a

depreciation of the currency to maintain PPP. Conversely, an expected rise in the foreign prices leads

to a fall in the demand for the foreign currency and therefore an appreciation of the domestic currency

to maintain PPP.

Equation (7.8) can be rewritten using price inflation expectations di$erentials instead of interest rate

di$erentials as:

_s_                        - ( _m_                        - _m_ *)                        -                        - ( _y_                        - _y_ *)                        -                        - ( _Pe_                         - _Pe_  *) (7.9)

154

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Te flexible price monetary model is based upon the premise that all prices in an economy are fully flexible,

that bonds are perfect substitutes and what matters for exchange rate determination is the demand for money

in relation to the supply of money. In such circumstances, countries with high monetary growth rates will

have high inflationary expectations which leads to a reduction in the demand to hold real money balances, an

increased expenditure on goods, a rise in the domestic price level and a depreciation of the currency in order

to maintain PPP. Tere have been many tests of the monetarist models but, given that the theory is based upon

PPP, it is not surprising that it has not performed well empirically (empirical tests of this and other exchange

rate models are dealt with in Chapter 9).

Despite its shortcomings and reliance on PPP, the flexible-price monetarist model is an important addition

to exchange rate theory because it introduces the role of money supplies, inflationary expectations and

economic growth as determinants of exchange rate changes.

**Box 7.2 The carry trade does not make sense according to UIP**

In a carry trade investors borrow money in a low interest rate currency and place it into a higher interest

rate currency in the hope that the latter will either appreciate or not depreciate more than the interest

rate di$erential, enabling an excess return to be made. Te carry trade has been increasingly used in

recent years by hedge funds, speculators and banks despite the fact that UIP theory suggests that it will

not produce excess returns in the long run. Remember, the UIP condition predicts that over the long

run the low interest rate currency will on average appreciate by the interest rate di$erential so as to make

the carry trade a break-even strategy. Nonetheless, if UIP does not hold then the carry trade might work

in the short run or even for several years (just as it can also fail at both time horizons). Te carry trade

will prove unpro!table if the currency with the high interest rate depreciates by an amount greater than

the interest rate di$erential over the relevant time horizon.

A simple example of the carry trade will suffice. Imagine the yen/euro rate is 100 yen per euro and

the Japanese interest rate is 1% and the euro interest rate is 5%. A hedge fund might decide to borrow

10 million yen for one year knowing it will have to pay back 10,100,000 yen in a year's time. Te hedge

fund then sells the yen in the spot market to gain €100,000 which will earn 5% in euros and so become

€105,000. So long as the euro has not depreciated to below 96.19 yen/€1 then the carry trade will be

pro!table. For example, if the euro actually appreciates to 110 yen/€1 then the hedge fund will make

1,450,000 yen pro!t (or €13,181.82). Even if the exchange rate remains at 100 yen/€1 the hedge fund will

be able to convert the €105,000 and obtain 10,500,000 yen and so make a 400,000 yen pro!t (or €4,000).

Te carry trade strategy will break even if the euro depreciates approximately 4% to 96.19 yen/€1 when

€105,000 converts to 10,100,000 yen, which is just sufficient to repay the borrowed 10,000,000 yen

plus 100,000 yen interest. However, there are risks with the carry trade. Te real danger is if the yen

appreciates by substantially more than 4%. Say the yen were to appreciate sharply to 80 yen per euro by

the end of the year. In this case the €105,000 will be worth 8,400,000 yen leaving the hedge fund with a

shortfall (loss) of 1,700,000 yen of the required 10,100,000 yen that it needs to repay, which is the euro

equivalent loss of €21,250. Te various scenarios are depicted in Figure 7.2.

According to UIP on average we can expect the Japanese yen to appreciate to 96.19 so that the

expected pro!t from the carry trade is zero. Te carry trade therefore implies that markets on average

lead to a depreciation of the high interest rate currency less than would be predicted by the interest

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

7.5 THE DORNBUSCH STICKY-PRICE MONETARIST MODEL.

One of the major de!ciencies of the flexible-price monetarist model is that it assumes that PPP holds

continuously and that prices are as flexible upwards and downwards as exchange rates. Indeed, it is price

changes that are supposed to induce exchange rate changes via the PPP condition. As such, the model is of no

use in explaining the observed prolonged departures from PPP since floating exchange rates were adopted. In

a classic article, Dornbusch (1976a) proposed a monetary exchange rate model that could explain large and

prolonged departures of the exchange rate from PPP.

Te model outlined by Dornbusch is termed the sticky-price monetarist model and introduces the concept

- f exchange rate 'overshooting'. Te basis underlying the model is that prices in the goods market and wages in
the labour market are determined in sticky-price markets and only tend to change slowly over time in response
to various shocks such as changes in the money supply. Prices and wages are especially resistant to downward
pressure. However, the exchange rate is determined in a 'flex-price' market and can immediately appreciate or
depreciate in response to new developments and shocks. In such circumstances, exchange rate changes are not
matched by corresponding price movements and there can be persistent and prolonged departures from PPP.

As the Dornbusch overshooting model represents such an important contribution to exchange rate theory

and understanding exchange rate behaviour, we shall !rst consider a simple explanation of the model without

recourse to the use of mathematics to grasp the essential ideas. Only then shall we proceed to a more formal

presentation of the model.

7.6 A SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE DORNBUSCH MODEL

In the Dornbusch model the UIP condition is assumed to hold continuously; that is, if the domestic interest

rate is lower than the foreign interest rate then there needs to be an equivalent expected rate of appreciation

- f the domestic currency to compensate for the lower domestic interest rate. Tis is because there is perfect
arbitrage of expected returns in capital markets. By contrast, goods prices adjust only slowly over time to
changes in economic policy partly because wages are only adjusted periodically and partly because !rms are
slow to adjust their prices upwards or downwards – so we have 'sticky' domestic prices.

In such an environment, imagine that everyone believes that the long-run exchange rate is determined by

PPP. Also, that the economy is initially in full equilibrium with a domestic interest rate _r_ 1 equal to the world

interest rate, so that there is no expected appreciation or depreciation of the currency. Such a situation is

illustrated in Figure 7.4. Te domestic money stock is given by _M_ 1 which gives a domestic price level of _P_ 1 and

an exchange rate _S_ 1 which, given the foreign price level, corresponds to PPP. Let us now suppose that at time

_t_ 1 the authorities unexpectedly expand the domestic money supply by 20% from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2.

In the long run everyone knows that a 20% rise in the domestic money supply will lead to a 20% rise

in domestic prices from _P_ 1 to _P_ and therefore a 20% depreciation of the domestic currency from _S_ 1 to _S_

to maintain long-run PPP. However, in the short run the Dornbusch model shows that things will be very

di$erent: because domestic prices are sticky they remain at _P_ 1. Te unexpected increase in the domestic

money supply will mean that at price level _P_ 1 there is now an excess supply of money that will only willingly

be held if the domestic interest rate falls from _r_ to _r_ . As the domestic interest rate will then be lower than the

1 2

world interest rate, this means that speculators will require an expected appreciation of the domestic currency

to compensate. For this reason, the domestic currency jump depreciates at time _t_ 1 from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2, overshooting

its long-run equilibrium value _S_ . Te exchange rate has to 'overshoot' its long-run equilibrium value because it

**Figure 7.4** Te dynamics of the Dornbusch overshooting model

is only by depreciating by more than 20% that there can be an expected appreciation of the domestic currency

to compensate for the lower rate of interest on domestic bonds.

A,er the initial response of the exchange rate and interest rate to the increase in the money stock, there are

a number of forces that come into play to move the economy to its long-run equilibrium. As a result of the fall

in the domestic interest rate and the depreciation of the domestic currency, there is an increase in the demand

for domestic goods. As output is assumed to be !xed, this excess demand for domestic goods starts to drive

up domestic prices from _P_ 1. Te increased demand for domestic goods by foreigners leads to an exchange rate

appreciation from _S_ 2 to _S_ (thus the expected appreciation is matched by an actual appreciation). At the same

time, the rise in the domestic price level leads to an increase in domestic money demand and a rise in the

domestic interest rate to maintain money-market equilibrium. Over time the domestic price level rises from

_P_ 1 to _P_ by the same percentage as the increase in the money supply; the exchange rate appreciates from _S_ 2 to

_S_ which corresponds to a restoration of PPP. Meanwhile, the domestic interest rate rises from _r_ 2 to its original

level _r_ 1, so that once again there is neither an expected appreciation nor depreciation of the domestic currency.

Having outlined the principal idea we now proceed to a more formal exposition of the Dornbusch model

- f exchange rate overshooting. Tose readers who wish to skip this can proceed straight to section 7.12.

7.7 A FORMAL EXPLANATION OF THE DORNBUSCH MODEL

In the model outlined, we focus upon a 'small country' in the sense that it faces a !xed world interest rate _r_ which it cannot influence. Te demand to hold money in the home country is given by a conventional money

demand function:

_m_            - _p_            -            - _y_            - � _r_ (7.10)

158

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

where _m_ is the log of the domestic money stock, _p_ is the log of the domestic price level, _y_ is the log of domestic

real income and _r_ is the nominal domestic interest rate.

We again assume that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes so that the UIP condition holds,

that is:

_Es_                     - � _r_ _r_                    - (7.11)

where _Es_ ˙ is the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency.

Te major di$erence between the sticky-price and flexible-price monetary models is that the stickyprice model assumes that PPP holds only in the long run, not continuously as assumed in the flexible-price

monetary model. Te hypothesis that the long-run exchange rate is determined by PPP yields:

_s_                          - _p_                          - _p_                          - (7.12)

where ~~_s_~~ is the log of the long-run equilibrium exchange rate, ~~_p_~~ is the log of the long-run domestic price level

and ~~_p_~~ - is the log of the long-run foreign price level.

Since the model allows for departures from PPP, it is necessary to specify an equation for the expected rate

- f change of the exchange rate. Te Dornbusch model speci!es a regressive exchange given by:



_Es_                 -                 - ( ~~_s_~~                 - _s_ ) where                 -                 - 0 (7.13)

Equation (7.13) states that the expected rate of depreciation of a currency is determined by the speed of

adjustment parameter 1 and the gap between the current exchange rate _s_ and its long-run equilibrium value

~~_s_~~ . If the spot rate is above ~~_s_~~, then the exchange rate of the domestic currency will be expected to appreciate

(that is, _Es_ ˙ is negative), whereas if the spot rate _s_ is below ~~_s_~~ then the exchange rate of the domestic currency is

expected to depreciate (that is, _Es_ ˙ is positive).

We now proceed to derive the two schedules vital to the Dornbusch model: the goods-market equilibrium

schedule, which shows equality of aggregate demand and supply for goods, and the money-market equilibrium

schedule, which shows equality between the demand and supply of money.

7.8 DERIVATION OF THE GOODS-MARKET EQUILIBRIUM SCHEDULE

Te goods-market equilibrium (GG) schedule shows the equality of demand and supply for goods in the price

level–exchange rate plane. Te model postulates that the rate of price inflation in the model is determined by

the gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Tat is:



_p_                   -                   - ( _d_                   - _y_ ) (7.14)

where _p˙_ is the rate of domestic price inflation, _π_ is the speed of adjustment of prices and _d_ is the log of

aggregate demand and _y_ the log of real income.

Aggregate demand is assumed to be a function of exogenous expenditure *, a positive function of the real

exchange rate expressed in log form as ( _s_ - _p_ + _p_ *), a positive function of domestic income and a negative

function of the domestic nominal interest rate, which yields:

_d_              -              -              -              - ( _s_              - _p_              - _p_ )*              -              - _y_              -              - _r_ (7.15)

Substituting equation (7.15) into equation (7.14) we obtain:



_p_             -             - �[             -             - ( _s_             - _p_             - _p_ *)             - (�             - 1) _y_             -             - _r_ ] (7.16)

Along the GG schedule the equality of supply and demand for goods means that there is zero inflation, that

is, _p˙_ = 0. To !nd the slope of the GG schedule we must substitute a solution for _r_ from equation (7.10) into

equation (7.16) to obtain:

.

_p_          -          - �[          -          - ( _s_          - _p_          - _p_ *)          - (�          - 1)y�          - �/ (p m�          -          - _y_ ) (7.17)

Ten by setting equation (7.17) to zero we !nd the slope of the GG schedule in the price level–exchange rate

plane. Along the GG schedule aggregate demand equals aggregate supply, implying zero price inflation. Te

slope of the GG schedule is given by:

dp - 

ds p 0  - - ���/

(7.18)

From equation (7.18) we can see that the GG schedule is upward-sloping from le, to right and has a slope of

less than unity, as shown in Figure 7.5.

Te rationale behind the GG schedule is that a depreciation (rise) of the exchange rate leads to an

increased demand for exports, which can only be o$set by a rise in the domestic price level which negates

the competitive advantage of the depreciation. However, because the rise in the price level increases money

demand, it is accompanied by a rise in interest rates which further reduces demand. Tis means that the

percentage depreciation of the exchange rate has to exceed the percentage rise in the price level to keep

aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply.

To the le, of the GG schedule in Figure 7.5 there is an excess supply of goods due to the fact that, assuming

- output to be !xed for any given price level, an exchange rate appreciation (fall) reduces aggregate demand.
Te excess supply of goods will put downward pressure on prices. Conversely, to the right of the GG schedule,
for any given price level, the exchange rate depreciation (rise) leads to an excess demand for domestic goods
causing an upward pressure on prices.

7.9 DERIVATION OF THE MONEY-MARKET EQUILIBRIUM SCHEDULE

Te money-market (MM) schedule shows di$erent combinations of the price level and exchange rate that are

consistent with equilibrium in the money market; that is, equilibrium of the supply and demand for money. To

derive the money-market schedule we !rst of all invert the money demand function (equation 7.10) to solve

the domestic interest rate, which yields:

_r_ - _p_ - _m_ - - _y_

(7.19)

We then substitute the solution for _Es_ ˙ in equation (7.11) into equation (7.13) and replace the solution for _r_ in

equation (7.19) to obtain:

1

_s_                   - _s_                   - _p_                   - _m_                   -                   - _y_                   -                   - _r_ *] (7.20)

          - � [[]

which means that the slope of the money-market schedule is given by:

d

d

_p_ (7.21)

_s_ [����]

_p_

Hence the MM schedule is shown to have a negative slope in the price level–exchange rate plane as shown in

Figure 7.6.

For a given money stock a fall in the price level implies a relatively high real money stock, and

high real money balances will only be willingly held if the domestic interest rate falls, which requires

an expected appreciation of the currency to compensate holders of the domestic currency. Given that

exchange rate expectations are regressive, such an expected appreciation can only occur if the exchange

rate depreciates.

Equilibrium of the model occurs when both the goods and money markets are in equilibrium and the

exchange rate is at its PPP value as shown in Figure 7.7.

Te PPP line is depicted as a ray from the origin indicating that if the domestic price level increases by _x_ %

then the exchange rate must also depreciate by _x_ % to maintain PPP. Te GG schedule as we have seen is less

steep than the PPP line because an _x_ % rise in the price level needs to be accompanied by a greater than _x_ %

depreciation of the exchange rate. Te money-market schedule is given by MM, and it is assumed that the

money market is in continuous equilibrium so that the economy is always somewhere on the MM schedule.

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Te economy is in full equilibrium when the exchange rate corresponds to PPP, aggregate supply equals

aggregate demand and there is asset-market equilibrium – this occurs where all three schedules intersect

at point A. We are now in a position to consider the e$ects of an economic shock such as an increase in the

domestic money supply in the Dornbusch model.

7.10 A MONEY SUPPLY EXPANSION AND EXCHANGE RATE 'OVERSHOOTING'

Te e$ects of an _x_ % increase in the money supply in the context of the Dornbusch model are illustrated in

Figure 7.8.

Initially the economy is in full equilibrium at point A where the G1G1 schedule intersects the M1M1 schedule.

Let us now suppose that the authorities unexpectedly expand the money supply by _x_ %. Before examining the

short-run e$ects of the money expansion it is worth considering what will be the long-run e$ects. In the long

run, we know that domestic prices will rise by the same percentage as the rise in the money stock, which gives

a long-run price of _P_ which is _x_ % above _p_ 1. As PPP holds in the long run, a rise in the domestic price level of

_x_ % requires a depreciation of the exchange rate by _x_ %, which gives a long-run exchange rate. Bearing this in

mind we can now consider the short-run e$ects of the monetary expansion.

In the short run, the _x_ % increase in the money supply results in a rightward shi, of the M1M1 schedule to

M2M2. We know that the M2M2 schedule must pass through the long-run equilibrium price _P_ and long-run

exchange rate _S_ at point C. Te major feature of the Dornbusch model is that, in the short run, domestic prices

are sticky, while money markets are in continuous equilibrium, as indicated by the UIP condition. In the

context of Figure 7.8 this means that the economy is always on the new money-market equilibrium schedule

M2M2. As domestic prices do not initially change, the price level remains at _p_ 1 and this is consistent with a

jump in the exchange rate from S1 to S2 on the money-market equilibrium schedule M2M2. Te fact that the

short-run equilibrium exchange rate S2 exceeds the long-run equilibrium rate _S_ is known as exchange rate

'overshooting'.

Te reason why in the short run the exchange rate overshoots its long-run equilibrium value is as follows.

Given that domestic prices are !xed in the short run, the money supply expansion creates an excess of real

money balances which (given a !xed output level) are only willingly held at a lower domestic interest rate.

According to the UIP condition, a fall in the domestic interest rate means that international investors will

require an expected appreciation of the domestic currency to compensate for the lower domestic interest rate.

An expected appreciation of the domestic currency is only possible if the exchange rate depreciation in the

short run exceeds the required long-run depreciation. Tis is shown in Figure 7.8 by the fact that the exchange

rate jump depreciates from S1 to S2, overshooting the long-run equilibrium exchange rate _S_ . Te exchange rate

is then expected to appreciate from S2 to _S_ .

Having had a short-run jump in the exchange rate to point B on the M2M2 schedule, forces come into play

to move the economy along the M2M2 schedule over time from point B to the long-run point C. Tere are two

factors at work in the movement from B to C during which time the currency appreciates from S2 to its longrun equilibrium value _S_ and the price level rises from _P_ 1 to its long-run value _P_ . First, the reduced domestic

interest rate will encourage increased expenditure. Second, the undervaluation of the currency in relation to

its PPP value will mean that domestic goods become relatively cheap as compared to foreign goods, and this

leads to a substitution of world demand in favour of domestic goods which Dornbusch (1976b) identi!es as

the 'arbitrage e$ect'. Tese two factors work to shi, up the goods market expenditure schedule from G1G1 to

G2G2 and drive up the domestic price level and appreciate the exchange rate until the long-run equilibrium is

established at point C. During the transition, the rise in the price level reduces real money balances, requiring

a rise in the domestic interest rate until at _P_ the original interest rate is restored and there is no expected

change in the exchange rate.

7.11 IMPORTANCE OF THE STICKY-PRICE MONETARY MODEL

Te sticky-price monetary model represented a major advance in the exchange rate literature, and it has had

lasting appeal. Te major innovation of the model is its emphasis on capital-market rather than goods-market

arbitrage as being the major determinant of exchange rates in the short run. Goods-market arbitrage is viewed

as relevant to exchange rate determination only in the medium to long run, while the desire of investors to

equalize expected yields on their international portfolios is viewed as the major determinant of the short-run

exchange rate.

Te model provides an intuitively appealing explanation of why exchange rate movements have been large

relative to movements in international prices and changes in international money stocks. Furthermore, it

explains such movements as the outcome of a rational foreign exchange market that produces an exchange

rate that deviates from PPP according to economic fundamentals and not in isolation from them. Most

economists !nd it hard to accept the notion that observed divergences of exchange rates from PPP have been

due to irrational speculation. Te existence of models such as Dornbusch's that explain such deviations as the

result of rational speculation provide considerable comfort.

164

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Another important point that comes from the Dornbusch model is that it helps explain why observed

exchange rates are usually even more volatile than supposed determinants such as the money supply.

Since the exchange rate initially depreciates by more than _x_ % in the short run in response to an _x_ %

increase in the money supply, it follows that the exchange rate will be more volatile than domestic

monetary policy.

7.12 THE FRANKEL REAL-INTEREST-RATE-DIFFERENTIAL MODEL

Te sticky-price monetary model of Dornbusch represents a major advance on the flexible-price monetary

exchange rate model; but, unlike the latter, the Dornbusch model does not explicitly take into account

inflationary expectations. However, the 1970s period of floating exchange rates was dominated by inflation.

In a bid to combine the inflationary expectations element of the flexible-price monetary model with the

insights of the sticky-price model, Frankel (1979) developed a general monetary exchange rate model that

accommodates the 'flexible-price' and 'sticky-price' monetarist models as special cases.

As in the other monetarist models, there is a conventional money demand function:

_m_           - _p_           - � _y_           - � _r_ (7.22)

where _m_ is the log of the domestic money stock, _p_ is the log of the domestic price level, _y_ is the log of domestic

real income and _r_ is the nominal domestic interest rate.

Similar relationships are postulated for the rest of the world as represented by the foreign country:

_m_          -          - _p_          -          -          - _y_          -          - � _r_          - (7.23)

where an asterisk represents a foreign variable.

For simplicity it is also assumed that elasticities (( and 2) are identical across countries. Combining

equations (7.22) and (7.23) yields:

( _m_                  - _m_ *)                  - ( _p_                  - _p_ *)                  -                  - ( _y_                  - _y_ *)                  - �( _r_                  - _r_ *) (7.24)

Like the other monetarist models the theory assumes that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes

so that the UIP condition holds:

_Es_                      - � _r_ _r_                     - (7.25)

where _Es_ ˙ is the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency.

As in the Dornbusch model, it is assumed that the expected rate of depreciation of the exchange rate is a

positive function of the gap between the spot rate _S_ and the long-run equilibrium rate _S_ . In addition it is also

a function of the expected long-run inflation di$erential between the domestic and foreign economies. Tis

yields:

  

_Es_                   -                   - ( ~~_s_~~                   - _s_ )                   - _Pe_                   - _Pe_                   - (7.26)

165

International Finance

where 1 is the speed of adjustment to equilibrium, _Pe˙_ is the expected long-run domestic inflation rate and _Pe˙_ is the expected long-run foreign inflation rate. Equation (7.26) states that, in the short run, the spot exchange

rate as given by _s_ is expected to return to its long-run equilibrium value _S_ at a rate 1. In the long run, since

s = ~~_s_~~ the expected rate of depreciation of the currency is equal to the di$erence of the domestic to foreign

inflation via the relative PPP condition.

Combining equations (7.25) and (7.26) yields:

1  

_s_                      - _s_                      - �                      - � _r_                      - _Pe_ )                      - ( * _r_                      - _Pe_ *)�� (7.27)

            - [(]

Equation (7.27) states that the gap between the current real exchange rate and its long-run equilibrium value

is proportional to the real interest rate di$erential as given by the term in brackets. Tus, if the real rate of

interest on domestic bonds is greater than the real rate of interest on foreign bonds, there will be a depreciation

- f the domestic currency until the real interest rates are equalized in the long-run steady state.

By invoking long-run PPP, the long-run equilibrium exchange rate ~~_s_~~ can be expressed in log form as the

di$erence between the long-run price levels:

_s_                            - _p_                            - _p_                            - (7.28)

In the long run the expected real rates of interest are equalized so that any long-run nominal interest rate

di$erentials are explained by di$erences in the steady-state inflation rates:

_r_                       - _r_                       -                       - _Pe_                        - _Pe_                        - (7.29)

By combining equations (7.29) and (7.28) with equation (7.24) we can obtain an expression for the long-run

steady-state equilibrium exchange rate given by:

 

~~_s_~~                   - ( _m_                   - _m_ *)                   -                   - ( _y_                   - _y_ *)                   -                   - ( _Pe_                   - _Pe_ *) (7.30)

Equation (7.30) states that the long-run equilibrium exchange rate is determined by the relative supply

( _m_ - _m_ *) and relative demands as given by ( ( _y_ - _y_ *) + 2 ( _Pe˙−Pe_ ˙*) of the two national money stocks. Te

reader will note that equation (7.30), which refers to the long-run exchange rate, is identical to equation (7.9)

- f the flexible-price monetarist model for the short-run exchange rate. However, the solution for the shortrun exchange rate in the Frankel model di$ers because of sticky prices in the short run. We will now proceed
to !nd the solution for the short-run exchange rate in the Frankel model.

In the Frankel generalization of the Dornbusch model, the speed of adjustment of the goods market is

relevant to the determination of the short-run exchange rate, so that equation (7.27) has to be taken into

account when solving the short-run exchange rate. Combining equation (7.30) with (7.27) and rearranging

terms yields the following solution for the short-run exchange rate:

_s_           - ( _m_           - _m_ *)           -           - ( _y_           - _y_ *)           -           - ( _Pe_            - _Pe_  *)           - 1           - �( _r_           - _Pe_  )           - ( * _r_           - _Pe_  *)�� (7.31)

166

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Te Frankel formulation makes clear that if there is a disequilibrium set of real interest rates, then the exchange

rate will deviate from its long-run equilibrium value. If the real domestic interest rate is below the real foreign

interest rate then the exchange rate of the domestic currency will be undervalued in relation to its long-run

equilibrium value, so that there is an expected appreciation of the real exchange rate of the domestic currency

to compensate.

Te fully flexible price monetarist school argues that all markets clear instantaneously so that the speed

- f adjustment parameter 1 in equation (7.31) is in!nite, so that the solution for the short-run exchange
rate is given by equation (7.9). In the real interest model as portrayed by equation (7.31), the goods and
labour market prices are assumed to be slow to adjust to shocks so the speed of adjustment parameter 1 is
!nite. Tus, rational expectations hold for the foreign exchange market but not for domestic markets. In such
circumstances, an unanticipated monetary expansion leads to a fall in the real domestic interest rate relative
to the real foreign interest rate, while the domestic price level is initially unchanged but expected to rise. Te
result according to equation (7.31) is that the short-run exchange rate overshoots its long-run equilibrium
value, depreciating proportionately more than the increase in the money stock so that there are expectations

- f a future appreciation of the currency to compensate for the lower real rate of return on domestic bonds.

7.13 IMPLICATIONS OF THE MONETARY VIEWS OF EXCHANGE RATE DETERMINATION

Whichever monetarist model one adopts, a clear implication is that monetary policy is the only predictable

and e$ective means of influencing the exchange rate. Furthermore, because domestic and foreign bonds are

assumed to be perfect substitutes there is no distinction to be made between the e$ects of an open market

- peration (OMO) and a foreign exchange market operation (FXO). An expansionary OMO is a purchase of
domestic Treasury bonds, while an expansionary FXO is a purchase of foreign bonds. As far as the monetary
model is concerned, if they increase the money supply by a like amount they have identical exchange rate
e$ects. What matters for the exchange rate is the supply of money in relation to the demand for it – the source

- f creation of the money stock is irrelevant.

From the above, it follows that there is no scope for the authorities to pursue a sterilized foreign exchange

- peration (SFXO) that will have exchange rate e$ects. An SFXO is an exchange of domestic for foreign bonds
that leaves the supply of money in relation to the demand for it una$ected. Within the context of the monetary
approach to exchange rate determination, because the two assets are perfect substitutes and the money supply
is le, unchanged, an SFXO cannot exert exchange rate e$ects.

In the flexible-price monetarist model, while the authorities can influence the nominal exchange in a

predictable fashion by monetary policy, they cannot do so with the real exchange rate. If there is a once

and for all _x_ % increase in the money supply this will lead to a once and for all _x_ % depreciation of the home

currency and a simultaneous _x_ % increase in both the domestic price level and wages. Tis is a case of complete

neutrality of monetary policy with respect to the real economy; monetary policy influences only nominal not

real variables.

Within the context of the sticky-price monetarist approach, the authorities can exploit the !nite speed of

adjustment of domestic markets to influence the real exchange rate in the short run, provided that real output

is !xed. For example, if there is an unexpected increase in the domestic money stock, we have seen that with

domestic prices that are sticky in the short run there will be a depreciation of the real exchange rate. Te

Frankel model makes clear that the overshooting of the exchange rate is proportional to the deviation of the

real domestic interest rate from its equilibrium value.

167

International Finance

Te possibility of real exchange rate overshooting due to the adoption of an expansionary or contractionary

monetary policy has strengthened the arguments of those that call for 'gradualism' in the implementation of

monetary policy. Te basis of their claim is that economic agents in the goods and labour markets take time

to adjust to a new monetary policy regime because they need convincing that the authorities mean what they

say. For this reason, domestic wage restraint is unlikely to follow immediately upon the adoption of a tighter

monetary policy. If this is the case, then the real exchange rate will appreciate in the short run and thereby

place pressure on the tradables sector of the economy. Gradualists argue that if the authorities implement

their policy of restraint gradually, then economic agents will have time to observe that the authorities are

implementing their stated policy and that wage behaviour will then adjust without the high cost imposed

upon the economy of overshooting.

Whichever monetarist view one adheres to, the clear implication is that monetary policy is the most e$ective

means of managing the exchange rate. Furthermore, in the long run the authorities should abandon any

attempt to influence the real exchange rate because it is determined by real and not monetary factors. Tus, in

the long run (short run in the flexible-price version) the authorities should direct exchange rate management

at stabilizing the domestic price level. Whether stabilizing the domestic price level will stabilize the nominal

exchange rate depends upon the stability of the foreign price level and therefore upon the monetary policies of

foreign countries. Te authorities should not seek to stabilize the nominal exchange rate by monetary policy

because this may involve destabilizing the domestic price level if the foreign authorities are not pursuing

stable monetary policies.

**Box 7.3 Is the new open economy macroeconomics a challenge to the**
**Mundell–Fleming and Dornbusch overshooting models?**

Obstfeld and Rogo$ (1995) started what has become known as the literature on new open economy

macroeconomics (NOEM); other contributions in this area include Chari et al. (2002), Lane (2001),

Corseti and Pesenti (2001) and Sarno (2001), and an excellent exposition of many issues is contained

in Mark (2001, ch. 9). While this literature is technically quite advanced, it is important to understand

how it di$ers from the Mundell–Fleming and Dornbusch overshooting models. Te new open

economy macroeconomics is based on microeconomic foundations and is intertemporal in nature.

A representative consumer maximizes their utility over their (in!nite!) lifetime; this utility depends

positively upon current and future consumption, positively upon their real money balances, and

negatively on work e$ort (and since work e$ort is positively related to output, then utility is negatively

related to output). Te model assumes that both PPP and UIP hold at all times, that goods produced at

home and abroad are di$erentiated (a market structure based on monopolistic competition) and, since

producers have monopolistic price setting powers, there is a suboptimal level of real output. Economic

agents are assumed to be interested in smoothing their consumption over time in both the home and

foreign economies, and their interactions are explicitly modelled and money demand is positively

related to consumption rather than to income.

Te main focus of the Obstfeld and Rogo$ (1995) _Redux_ paper is on analysing the impacts of a

monetary shock. They show that, when good prices are perfectly flexible, a permanent increase in the

money supply produces no dynamics and that prices increase in exact proportion to the increase in the

money supply and the exchange rate depreciates by a like amount, so monetary policy has no role in

correcting the suboptimal level of output. If, however, one allows for price stickiness in the goods markets

168

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

in the short run, then things are very di$erent: an increase in the money supply will lead to a fall in the

domestic interest rate and a depreciation of the currency, which makes domestic goods cheaper relative

to foreign goods and leads to an increase in domestic output since increases in demand will encourage

monopolistic producers to raise output, even with !xed short-run domestic prices. Although output rises,

consumption rises by less; and since consumers wish to smooth consumption over time they save part of

the increase in output, hence the current account moves into surplus, which then raises domestic wealth

due to an accumulation of foreign assets which over time reduces their work e$ort. In the long run, the

level of domestic output is permanently higher than before the monetary expansion (though lower than

the initial level of output induced by the monetary shock), so money is non-neutral in the long run.

In the short run, while the exchange rate depreciates, it does not overshoot, as in the Dornbusch

model, because the foreign interest rate also declines following the home monetary expansion, the lower

interest rate and the improved terms of trade raise consumption in the foreign economy. It is not clear

what happens to foreign output because, while the increase in foreign consumption will tend to raise

its output, the appreciation of its currency will tend to work in the opposite direction. In any case, the

increase in foreign consumption is greater than any output rise (or fall) resulting in a current account

de!cit for the foreign economy.

A remarkable result of the Obstfeld and Rogo$ paper is that the monetary expansion raises domestic

and foreign welfare by equal amounts despite the di$ering output e$ects on the two economies. Tis

is because the fall in interest rate generates equivalent increases in consumption in both the domestic

and foreign economies. Tere is an improvement in world welfare as global output rises following the

monetary shock. Tere is one big problem with the new open economy models, however, which is that

they are extremely sensitive to the particular model speci!cation. For example, Corseti and Pesenti

(2001) show that under a di$erent model speci!cation a monetary shock does not lead to a current

account surplus (in fact, it stays in balance) and the long-run output e$ects of a monetary expansion are

neutral. Obstfeld and Rogo$ did not allow for the presence of physical capital, but Chari et al. (1998)

argue that it is essential to allow for capital since a monetary expansion by lowering the domestic interest

rate may lead to an investment boom and a short-run current account de!cit rather than the surplus

in Obstfeld and Rogo$. Lane (2001) shows that, for a small open economy exchange rate, overshooting

still occurs since the fall in the domestic interest rate does not lead to a fall in the interest rate in the

large economy. Similarly, as outlined in Mark (2001), if !rms price to market then it is also possible to

get exchange rate overshooting in the Obstfeld and Rogo$ model.

Tere is no doubt that the new open economy macroeconomics o$ers some new and important

insights, particularly the emphasis on the microfoundations and importance of market structure. As

Lane (2001, p. 236) points out:

Tis approach o$ers several attractions. Te presentation of explicit utility and pro!t maximisation

problems provides welcome clarity and analytical rigour. Moreover, it allows the researcher to

conduct welfare analysis, thereby laying the groundwork for credible policy evaluation. Allowing

nominal rigidities and market imperfections alters the transmission mechanism for shocks and

also provides a more potent role for monetary policy. In this way, by addressing issues of concern

to policymakers, one goal of this new strand of research is to provide an analytical framework that

is relevant for policy analysis and o$ers a superior alternative to the Mundell–Fleming model that

is still widely employed in policy circles as the theoretical reference point.

International Finance

Although the new open economy models are rigorous and allow for rich dynamics, the outcome of

the models can prove very sensitive to, _inter alia_ : the speci!cation of the utility function; elasticities

between current and future consumption, and between domestic and foreign goods; whether price

stickiness originates from the labour or goods markets; the type of market structure assumed; whether

the economy is small or large; the size of the monetary shocks; and whether allowance is made for

traded and non-traded goods. As Sarno and Taylor (2002, p. 165) put it:

Agreeing on a particular new open economy model is hardly possible at this stage. Tis is the case

not least because it requires agreeing on assumptions which are o,en difficult to test empirically

(such as the speci!cation of the utility function) or because they concern issues about which many

economists have strong beliefs on which they are not willing to compromise (such as whether

nominal rigidities originate from the goods market or the labour market or whether nominal

rigidities exist at all) … While the profession shows some convergence towards a _consensus approach_

in macroeconomic modelling (where the need for micro foundations, for example, seems widely

accepted), it seems very unlikely that a _consensus model_ will emerge in the foreseeable future.

Hence, because of their diverse predictions and sensitivity of their results to parameter values and

particular model speci!cations, the results of the new open economy macromodels must be treated

with extreme caution when it comes to making policy recommendations. Te modern approach is,

nonetheless, clearly a major threat to the established Mundell–Fleming paradigm that has dominated

international macroeconomic thinking and modelling since the early 1960s.

7.14 ALLOWING FOR IMPERFECT SUBSTITUTABILITY BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN

BONDS

Te monetary models of exchange rate determination we have so far examined make the crucial assumption

that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes. Tis implies that the expected yields on domestic

and foreign bonds are equalized via the UIP condition. In e$ect, apart from their currency of denomination,

domestic and foreign bonds are regarded by international investors as the same. In this section, we will

examine the portfolio balance e$etc which breaks up the UIP condition by introducing a risk premium. Te

portfolio balance model distinguishes itself from the monetary models because it allows for the possibility

that international investors may regard domestic and foreign bonds as having di$erent characteristics other

than their currency of denomination in particular; they might for various reasons regard one of the bonds as

being more risky than the other. Tis being the case they will generally require a higher expected return on

the bond that is considered more risky to compensate for the additional risk it entails. For a risk premium to

exist, all of the following three conditions must be ful!lled (see Isard, 1983):

1. Tere must be perceived di$erences in risks between domestic and foreign bonds – the essence of a

risky asset being that its expected real rate of return is uncertain. Either domestic bonds are viewed

as relatively risky compared to foreign bonds, or vice versa. If the two bonds were equally risky then,

with perfect capital mobility, they must be perfect substitutes.

2. Tere has to be risk-aversion on the part of economic agents to the perceived di$erences in risk. Te

principle of risk-aversion is that investors will only be prepared to take on increased risk if there is a

170

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

sufficient increase in expected real returns to compensate. If investors were not risk-averse then they

would not expect a higher return on relatively risky bonds.

3. Given the di$erent risks on domestic and foreign bonds there is a theoretical portfolio known as the

risk-minimizing portfolio which would minimize the risks facing private agents. Tere must be a

di$erence between the risk-minimizing portfolio and the actual portfolio, forced at market clearing

prices into investors' portfolios. However, the amount of domestic and foreign bonds held by private

agents is determined by the respective authorities that issue them. If the risk-minimizing portfolio is

not held, then agents will demand a risk premium to compensate.

If all three of the above conditions are ful!lled, then the UIP condition will not hold due to the existence of

a risk premium which represents the compensation required by private agents for accepting risk exposure

above the minimum possible. When a risk premium exists, then the UIP condition no longer holds and

instead a more relevant equation is given by:

_r_                          - _r_                          -                          - _Es_                           - _RP_ (7.32)

where _RP_ is the risk premium on the domestic currency.

According to equation (7.32) the UIP condition may no longer hold due to the existence of a risk premium.

Imagine that domestic bonds require a 2% risk premium over foreign bonds. Ten a possible numerical

example of equation (7.32) is as follows:

10% – 5% = 3% + 2%

Tat is, the domestic bonds have an expected return of 10%, while foreign bonds have an expected return of

- nly 8% (that is, 5% interest plus a 3% expected appreciation of the foreign currency; that is, a 3% expected
depreciation of the domestic currency). Te reason for this is that domestic bonds are regarded as more risky
by investors, which is reflected by a 2% risk premium on the domestic bonds. In principle, of course, there is
no real reason why domestic bonds need to be considered more risky than foreign bonds; it may well be the
reverse, which would be reflected by a negative risk premium on the domestic bonds such that the expected
rate of return on domestic bonds is lower than on foreign bonds.

Te most simple formulation of the risk premium on the domestic currency is to say that it is positively

related to the supply of domestic bonds and negatively related to the supply of foreign bonds. One means of

expressing such a function in log form is given by:

_RP_ - [�] - - _b_ - � _s_ _f_

(7.33)

where + is a constant, _b_ is the log of domestic bonds in the hands of private agents, _s_ is the log of the exchange

rate, _f_ is the log of foreign currency denominated bonds in the hands of private agents, and * is a parameter

measuring the degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds.

Te !rst element + is a constant term; when it is positive it means that there is a preference for domestic

bonds, but if it is negative there is a preference for foreign bonds. Te more interesting is the second part

- f the equation, which suggests that when we increase the holdings of domestic bonds in private agents'
portfolios the risk premium on the domestic currency rises (or risk premium on the foreign currency falls),

171

International Finance

because there will be an increase in the proportion of domestic bonds in agents' portfolios which increases

the domestic risk to agents' portfolios and requires a rise in the risk premium on the domestic currency to

compensate investors for the increased risk exposure to domestic bonds in their portfolios. On the other hand,

a depreciation of the exchange rate (a rise in _s_ ) will lead to a fall in the risk premium required on domestic

bonds (or a rise on the risk premium on foreign bonds), because a depreciation of the domestic currency

increases the domestic currency value of foreign bonds held in private agents' portfolios and so increases the

risk exposure to foreign bonds, so lowering the risk premium required on domestic bonds. Similarly, a rise in

foreign bond holdings will lead to a fall in the risk premium required on domestic bonds, because this results

in a rise in the proportion of foreign bonds held in private agents' portfolios and so increases the risk exposure

to foreign bonds, thus lowering the risk premium required on domestic bonds (or raising the risk premium on

foreign bonds). Te parameter * is crucial as it is a measure of the degree of substitutability between domestic

and foreign bonds. As we raise the value of *, domestic and foreign bonds become closer substitutes, and this

lowers the risk premium. In the limiting case when * approaches in!nity then domestic and foreign bonds are

perfect substitutes so that the risk premium vanishes, as can be readily veri!ed in equation (7.33).

If we insert equation (7.33) into equation (7.32) we obtain:

_r_                       - � _r_ _Es_                        -                       -                       - _b_                       - � _s_ _f_ (7.34)

                   -                    

which can be rewritten as:

_b_                 - � _s_ _f_                 -                 - ��( _r_                 - _r_                 -                 - _Es_  ) (7.35)

Equation (7.35) makes it clear that in order to hold more domestic currency denominated bonds, domestic

investors would require either a rise in the interest rate di$erential in favour of domestic bonds and/or an

expected appreciation of the domestic currency, that is, _Es˙_ < 0. Allowing for domestic and foreign bonds

to have di$erent characteristics is potentially very important, because money market and foreign exchange

- perations that influence the exchange rate a$ect the composition of domestic and foreign bonds in agents’
portfolios in di$erent ways. We shall be using equation (7.35) in the synthesis exchange rate model that
follows, hence it is important to understand the rationale behind the equation.

7.15 A SYNTHESIS PORTFOLIO BALANCE MODEL

Je$rey Frankel (1983 and 1984) extended his monetary synthesis equation (1979) to incorporate a portfolio

balance e$etc. Te basic derivation of his synthesis exchange rate equation is as follows (see Frankel, 1983).

One begins with a conventional domestic money demand function given by:

_m = p +_ ( _y –_ 2 _r_ (7.36)

where _m_ is the log of the domestic money supply, _p_ is the log of the domestic price level, _y_ is the log of

domestic real income, ( is money demand elasticity with respect to income, and 2 is money demand semielasticity with respect to the interest rate.

172

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

A similar money demand function is postulated for the foreign country, and assuming identical elasticities

for the foreign economy we have:

_m_ *= _p_ *+ ( _y_ *– 2 _r_            - (7.37)

where an asterisk represents a foreign variable.

Taking the di$erence of the two equations yields the relative money demand function:

( _m–m*_ ) = ( _p–p*_ ) + (( _y–y*_ ) – 2( _r–r*_ ) (7.38)

By invoking long-run PPP, the long-run equilibrium exchange rate _S_ can be expressed in log form as the

di$erence between the long-run price levels:

_s_                            - _p_                            - _p_                            - (7.39)

where ~~_p_~~ is the log of the long-run domestic price level, and ~~_p_~~ - is the log of the long-run foreign price level.

Substituting equation (7.39) into equation (7.38) and rearranging gives the following expression for the

long-run equilibrium exchange rate:

~~_s_~~                    - ( _m_                    - _m_ *)                    -                    - ( _y_                    - _y_ *)                    -                    - ( _r_                    - _r_ *) (7.40)

Rather than assume UIP, which is inconsistent with a portfolio balance framework, we use equation (7.35),

repeated here as equation (7.41):

_b_                - � _s_ _f_                -                -                -                - ( _r_                - _r_                -                - _Es_  ) (7.41)

where + is a constant, _b_ is the log of domestic bonds in the hands of private agents, and _f_ is the log of foreigncurrency-denominated bonds in the hands of private agents. Tat is, in order to hold more domestic-currencydenominated bonds domestic investors would require either a rise in the interest rate di$erential in favour

- f domestic bonds and/or an increased expected appreciation of the domestic currency (expected fall in the
exchange rate). Te parameter * measures the degree of substitutability: if * is equal to in!nity then moving it
and + to the le,-hand side yields the UIP condition.

Te expected change in the exchange rate is given by the following expression:

  

_Es_                   -                   - ( ~~_s_~~                   - _s_ )                   - _Pe_                   - _Pe_                   - (7.42)

where 1 is the speed of adjustment to equilibrium, _Pė_ is the expected long-run domestic inflation rate, and

_Pė*_

is the expected long-run foreign inflation rate. Tat is, the expected rate of change in the exchange rate is

determined by the speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium rate 1, the gap between the current and

long-run exchange rate and the expected inflation di$erential.

Solving for _Es˙_ in equation (7.41) we !nd that:

_Es_                    - [���] _b_ _s_ _f_                   -                   -                   - � _r_ _r_                   - (7.43)

173

International Finance

Tus, substituting (7.43) into (7.42) and rearranging we !nd that:

_s_                 - _s_                 - _b_                 - � _s_ _f_                 -                 -                 - 1 ( *�� _r_                 - _Pe_  *)                 - ( _r_                 - _Pe_  )�� (7.44)

             - �             

Finally, substituting our expression for the long-run equilibrium exchange rate given by equation (7.40) into

equation (7.44), and a,er some algebraic manipulation, we obtain an exchange rate equation that synthesizes

both the monetary and portfolio balance approaches to exchange rate determination, given by:

Te fully flexible price monetarist version postulates that as both the parameters 1 and * approach in!nity,

this reduces equation (7.46) to the flexible-price monetary equation (7.8). Te sticky-price monetarist school

holds that 1 is less than in!nite while * is in!nite, so we end up with the real interest di$erential equation

(7.31). On the other hand, the sticky-price portfolio balance model holds that both the parameters 1 and * are

less than in!nite, so that relative bond supplies have an impact on the exchange rate – the relevant equation

is therefore (7.46).

7.16 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO BALANCE MODEL

Te portfolio balance model is an important contribution to the exchange rate literature because it allows a

role for changes in perceived risk or risk-aversion in the determination of the exchange rate. For example, an

increase in the perceived riskiness of foreign bonds compared to domestic bonds can lead to both a fall in the

domestic interest rate and an appreciation of the domestic currency as private agents rebalance their portfolios.

On the other hand, an increase in the perceived riskiness of domestic bonds can lead to a depreciation of the

domestic currency and/or a rise in the domestic interest rate. Tese e$ects accord with intuition and are

frequently invoked to explain observed exchange rate changes. Such an e$etc is, however, absent from the

monetary models which assume that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes.

Another important contribution of the portfolio balance model is that there is a signi!cant role for the

current account to play in the determination of the exchange rate over time. A current account surplus implies

an accumulation of foreign assets (for example, foreign bonds) and an increase in domestic wealth – the result

is a larger proportion of foreign bonds in investors' portfolios than they desire. In turn, this leads to purchases

- f domestic bonds and a resulting appreciation of the domestic currency which will, over time, work to reduce
a current account surplus.

174

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Another contribution of the portfolio balance model is that it permits a relatively easy discussion of the

role of !scal policy in determining the exchange rate. A bond-!nanced !scal expansion has an ambiguous

e$ect on the exchange rate. Tis is because, while a higher proportion of domestic bonds in agents’ portfolios

will lead to an increase in the demand for foreign bonds, the higher domestic interest rate will lead to a fall in

the demand for foreign bonds. If the former e$etc is greater than the latter, the exchange rate depreciates; but

if the reverse is true, the exchange rate appreciates.

A signi!cant policy implication that emerges from the portfolio balance model is that a given change in

the money stock has a more powerful e$ect on the exchange rate when carried out by a purchase of foreign

assets (a FXO) than when achieved via a purchase of domestic assets (an OMO). To understand this, consider

a FXO whereby the central bank purchases foreign currency bonds, which increases the domestic money

supply but, by reducing private agents’ holdings of foreign bonds, induces them to sell domestic bonds and

purchase foreign ones, placing additional pressure for the domestic currency to depreciate. If, however, the

central bank undertakes an open market operation and expands the money supply by purchasing domestic

bonds, then the exchange rate will depreciate due to the rise in the relative money supply, the purchases of

domestic bonds create a shortage of these in private agents’ portfolios which they will try to o$set by selling

some foreign bonds to purchase domestic bonds which will to some extent reduce the depreciation of the

domestic currency compared to an FXO.

Another important result that comes from the portfolio balance model is that when domestic and foreign

bonds are imperfect substitutes, then an SFXO has the potential to exert exchange rate e$ects which cannot

happen in the monetarist models. If the authorities buy foreign bonds with the domestic currency and then

mop up the increase in the money supply by selling domestic bonds, then they have e$ectively reduced private

agents' holdings of foreign bonds while increasing their holdings of domestic bonds with the money supply

remaining unchanged. According to the portfolio balance model, the increase in the supply of domestic bonds

and decrease in the supply of foreign bonds held by the private sector will induce agents to attempt to restore

equilibrium in their portfolios by selling domestic bonds to purchase foreign bonds, leading to a depreciation

- f the currency which will help in the process of rebalancing their portfolios since it will lead to an increase
in the domestic currency value of foreign bonds in their portfolios. Hence, if domestic and foreign bonds are
imperfect substitutes, then foreign exchange intervention that leaves the domestic money supply unchanged
may still a$ect the exchange rate. Te potential for sterilized foreign exchange to exert exchange rate e$ects is
an important theoretical and empirical issue because it suggests that to some extent authorities might be able
to keep the money supply level unchanged and yet still move the exchange rate.

7.17 CONCLUSIONS

A common characteristic of the three monetary models of exchange rate determination examined in this

chapter is that what matters for the exchange rate is the money supply in relation to money demand in both the

home and foreign countries. Te exchange rate is the relative price of two national monies and is consequently

a monetary phenomenon.

All the monetary models build upon PPP. Te flexible-price monetary model assumes that PPP holds

continuously and maintains that the price level adjusts instantaneously to changes in the supply and demand

for money. Tis then leads to immediate exchange rate adjustment to maintain PPP. Changes in real income

and inflation expectations induce changes in the exchange rate because they a$etc the demand for money. In

the sticky-price monetary models the asymmetric speeds of adjustment in goods and asset markets can lead

to divergences from PPP in the short run, although PPP reasserts itself in the long run.

175

International Finance

Te sticky-price monetary models provide an explanation of both exchange rate volatility and misalignment.

Exchange rates can become misaligned in relation to PPP because of the phenomenon of exchange rate

- vershooting, while instability in monetary policies can result in even greater instability in exchange rates.
An important point made by the sticky-price model is that both divergences from PPP and highly volatile
exchange rates can be explained by rational speculation and are not necessarily the result of 'irrational' foreign
exchange speculation.

Perhaps the most noticeable omission of the monetary models of exchange rate determination is an explicit

role for the current account to influence the exchange rate. Furthermore, domestic and foreign bonds are

regarded as perfect substitutes; that is, they are regarded as equally risky, so there is no role for risk perceptions

to play a part in the determination of exchange rates. By contrast, the portfolio balance model of exchange rate

determination has an explicit and important role for both of these factors to influence exchange rates.

One issue that is not explicitly dealt with by the portfolio balance model is the precise reason for the

perceived di$erences in risks between domestic and foreign bonds. Tis can be caused amongst other things

by unstable economic policies and di$ering perceived political risks. In the circumstance where unstable

economic policies create the risks, it may be best for the authorities to stabilize their economic policies. In the

case where political risks are an issue, the authorities might consider ways of reducing such perceived risks. In

summary, reducing perceived risks may be an important mechanism for reducing exchange rate fluctuations.
