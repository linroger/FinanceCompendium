8.1 INTRODUCTION

The monetary models of exchange rate determination make the crucial assumption that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes. This implies that the expected yields on domestic and foreign bonds are equalized.

In e$ect, apart from their currency of denomination, domestic and foreign bonds are regarded by international

investors as the same. As we saw in Chapter 7, however, the portfolio balance model is distinguished from the

monetary models because it allows for the possibility that international investors may regard domestic and

foreign bonds as having different characteristics other than their currency of denomination. In particular, they might for various reasons regard one of the bonds as being more risky than the other. This being the case they will generally require a higher expected return on the bond that is considered more risky to compensate for the additional risk it entails.

Allowing for domestic and foreign bonds to have different characteristics is potentially very important because operations that influence the exchange rate affect the composition of domestic and foreign bonds in agents' portfolios in different ways. In this chapter we will use the portfolio balance model to examine three operations that are commonly used to influence the exchange rate:

1. An open market operation (OMO) which is defined as an exchange of domestic money base for domestic bonds or vice versa.

2. A foreign exchange operation (FXO) which is an exchange of domestic money for foreign bonds or vice versa. Such foreign exchange market intervention affects the domestic money supply and is termed a non-sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market.

3. A sterilized foreign exchange operation (SFXO) which is an exchange of domestic bonds for foreign bonds or vice versa, leaving the domestic money base unchanged.

The interesting thing about an SFXO is that it represents the difference between an OMO and FXO. An expansionary FXO means that the authorities purchase foreign bonds with domestic money, which means that the public holds more money and less foreign bonds. If the authorities decide they wish to keep the money supply at its original level they can conduct a contractionary monetary policy by selling domestic bonds to the public so that the money held by the public returns to its original level. If they conduct such a sterilization operation, the net effect is that the public holds fewer foreign bonds and more domestic bonds with the money supply unchanged.

In the monetary models the only thing that matters for the exchange rate is the money supply in relation to

the money demand, the source of money creation being unimportant. Tis means that in such models there

is no di$erence in the exchange rate and the interest rate e$ects of an FXO or OMO that change the money

supply by like amounts. Te reason is that in the monetary models there is no distinction between domestic

and foreign bonds. Within the context of the monetary models an SFXO will have no exchange rate or interest

rate e$ects because it leaves the money supply unchanged and is merely the exchange of domestic for foreign

bonds which are perfect substitutes.

In this chapter we will look at the portfolio balance model in more detail than was considered in Chapter

7. In particular, we examine the concept of a risk premium as being crucial to the portfolio balance approach

to exchange rate determination. We then look at di$erent types of risks that may make domestic and foreign

bonds imperfect substitutes and outline a simple version of the portfolio balance model, which we will use

to examine the di$ering e$ects of OMOs, FXOs and SFXOs. We then look at the results in the light of their

e$ects on the risk premium. Finally, we consider some of the dynamic features of the portfolio balance model.

8.2 THE CONCEPT OF A RISK PREMIUM

Te distinguishing feature of the portfolio balance model is that investors no longer regard domestic and

foreign bonds as perfect substitutes. This being the case the expected returns on the two assets no longer have to be equal. In other words, the UIP condition which was a key condition in the monetary models generally no longer holds. For example, if investors are risk-averse and regard domestic bonds as being relatively risky as compared to foreign bonds, they will require a higher expected return on domestic bonds than foreign.

Tis additional expected return on the relatively risky as compared to the less risky bond is known as the 'risk

premium'. For a risk premium to exist, all of the following three conditions must be ful!lled (see Isard, 1983):

1. Tere must be perceived di$erences in risks between domestic and foreign bonds – the essence of a

risky asset being that its expected real rate of return is uncertain. Either domestic bonds are viewed

as relatively risky compared to foreign bonds, or vice versa. If the two bonds were equally risky then

with perfect capital mobility they must be perfect substitutes.

2. Tere has to be risk-aversion on the part of economic agents to the perceived di$erences in risk – the

principle of risk-aversion is that investors will only be prepared to take on increased risk if there is a

178

The Portfolio Balance Model

sufficient increase in expected real returns to compensate. If investors were not risk-averse then they

would not expect a higher return on relatively risky bonds.

3. Given the di$erent risks on domestic and foreign bonds there is a theoretical portfolio known as the

risk-minimizing portfolio which would minimize the risks facing private agents. Tere must be a

di$erence between the risk-minimizing portfolio and the actual portfolio, forced at market clearing

prices into investors' portfolios. However, the amount of domestic and foreign bonds held by private

agents is determined by the respective authorities that issue them. If the risk minimizing portfolio is

not held then agents will demand a risk premium as compensation.

If all three of the above conditions are ful!lled, then the UIP condition will not hold due to the existence of

a risk premium which represents the compensation required by private agents for accepting risk exposure

above the minimum possible:

_r_                     - _r_                     -                     - _Es_                      - _RP_ (8.1)

where _r_ is the domestic interest rate, _r_ - is the foreign interest rate, _Es˙_ is the expected rate of depreciation

- f domestic currency de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, and _RP_ is the risk
premium required on domestic bonds, which may be either positive or negative.

Te di$erence between equation (8.1) and the UIP condition (equation 7.1) is the risk-premium expression.

Te expected rate of return on domestic bonds may be higher (a positive risk premium) or lower (a negative

risk premium) when compared to foreign bonds. For example, if domestic bonds are regarded as more risky

than foreign bonds, and if the domestic interest rate is 10%, the foreign interest rate 6% and the expected

rate of depreciation of the domestic currency is only 3%, then there is a 1% risk premium on the domestic

currency, foreign assets have an expected yield of 9%, the interest rate is 6% and there is a 3% expected

appreciation of the foreign currency, which is lower than the 10% yield on domestic bonds. Te 1% positive

risk premium on the domestic currency is a negative 1% risk premium on the foreign currency. An issue that

we need to examine briefly concerns the types of risk that may cause the emergence of a risk premium.

8.3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF RISK

When analysing risk, economists make some postulates about economic agents. Investors are assumed to

be rational in that they wish to maximize their expected utility which is a positive function of expected real

returns and a negative function of the perceived level of risk. Te basis of investors' portfolio decisions is

choosing an optimum combination of expected rate of return and risk, given their risk–return preferences

(degree of risk-aversion). Te less risk-averse investors are, the more they will be prepared to take on risk.

Conversely, the more risk-averse they are, the less risk they will be prepared to take on.

In the !rst instance we need to de!ne a risky asset. Te de!nition of a risky asset is that its expected real

rate of return is uncertain. In other words, economic agents for various reasons cannot be sure what the value

- f the return in terms of purchasing power will be.

Typically, risks fall into one of two main categories (see Wihlborg, 1978): 'currency risks' and 'country

risks'. Currency risks arise because domestic and foreign bonds are denominated in di$erent currencies, while

country risks arise because they are issued by countries with di$erent legal jurisdictions and di$erent political

regimes.

179

_Currency risks_

Tere are two types of currency risk that we shall consider: one is called 'inflation risk' and the other is termed

'exchange risk'.

 **Inflation risk.** Tis type of risk occurs because the inflation rates in the domestic and foreign
economies are uncertain. If PPP were to hold continuously, the real rate of return on the domestic
bond is given by the nominal interest rate less the expected domestic inflation rate ( _Pė_ ). If the latter
is uncertain then so will be the real return on the asset considered. Similarly, the expected real rate

    - f return on foreign bonds is given by the nominal foreign interest rate less the expected foreign

inflation rate ( _Pė*_ ) – if the latter is also subject to uncertainty then so will be the real return on

foreign bonds.

If PPP holds continuously and the expected domestic price inflation rate rises, this reduces the

expected real rate of return on domestic bonds but does not increase the expected real rate on foreign

bonds because the currency will depreciate by the same amount as the expected inflation rate. Te

risk of holding a domestic bond can therefore be represented as a positive function of the variance in

the domestic inflation rate while the risk of holding a foreign bond can be represented as a positive

function of the variance of the foreign inflation rate. A greater variance of the expected domestic

inflation rate raises the relative riskiness of domestic as compared to foreign bonds and vice versa.

 - **Exchange risk.** If PPP holds continuously, then inflation risk would be the sole currency risk facing
international investors. However, as we saw in Chapter 6, there is an overwhelming weight of
empirical evidence, since the advent of floating exchange rates, for rejecting the use of PPP as a valid
approximation of short-run exchange rate determination. Tis being the case, one then has to take
into account deviations from PPP when calculating the expected real rate of return on domestic and
foreign bonds during the holding period. While the expected real rate of return on domestic bonds
is given by the nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of inflation, the expected rate of return
from holding foreign bonds is now given by the foreign interest rate less the expected rate of inflation
plus the expected deviation of the exchange rate from PPP. For simplicity, let us assume that inflation
and domestic and foreign interest rates are equal and exchange rates are initially at PPP. In this case an
expected real depreciation of the currency in terms of PPP means that there is an expected appreciation

	- f the foreign currency, implying an increased expected return from holding foreign bonds. Te
expected real rate of return on domestic bonds is, however, una$ected by such deviations from PPP.

Te expected deviation of the exchange rate from PPP causes a risk speci!c to foreign bonds given

by the variance of the expected deviation from PPP. Tat is, fluctuations in the exchange rate that

cause deviations from PPP constitute a risk speci!c to foreign investments which is called 'exchange

risk'. Exchange rate changes only cause exchange risk to the extent that they represent deviations from

PPP. If exchange rate changes ensure that PPP holds, then they do not constitute such exchange rate

risk. Teoretically, therefore, exchange rate fluctuations are an incorrect measure of exchange risk. It

is fluctuations of the exchange rate around PPP that constitute exchange rate risk.

_Country risks_

Country risks are somewhat less amenable to economic analysis than currency risks. Nevertheless, since the

de!nition of a risky asset is that its expected real rate of return is uncertain, it is not difficult to conceptualize

country risks. Country risks can be divided into three types – exchange control risk, default risk and political risk.

180

The Portfolio Balance Model

 - **Exchange control risk.** Tis is a type of country risk whereby investors face uncertain real rates of
return. Te real rate of return on domestic and foreign bonds may be uncertain due to the risk of the
imposition of a tax on the interest element during the holding period. Tis risk may be greater or less
for domestic as compared to foreign bonds.

 - **Default risk.** Another, more serious, country risk is 'default risk' whereby a government refuses to
pay the interest and sometimes the principal on bonds issued by them and denominated in a foreign
currency. Note that the bonds need to be denominated in foreign currency because a government will
not default on bonds issued in its own currency since, in that case, it could always print the money to
redeem the bonds.

 - **Political risk.** Tis risk covers an extremely broad range of scenarios, but basically refers to the
danger that investors face because the political environment in a country could cause them to lose
part or all of their investment, including returns due, or to !nd costly restrictions imposed on how
they may manipulate their investments.

From the above discussion we can see that there are a variety of reasons why domestic and foreign bonds

may have di$erent relative riskiness, which is a necessary precondition for making them imperfect substitutes.

What matters to produce imperfect asset substitutability and a risk premium is perceived di$erences in risks

between domestic and foreign bonds. If assets are regarded as equally risky, then with perfect capital mobility

they must be perfect substitutes.

8.4 A PORTFOLIO BALANCE MODEL

The portfolio balance model of exchange rates was pioneered by Branson (1976, 1984), Branson et al. (1977), Branson and Henderson (1985) and Kouri (1976) and has been subsequently modified and extended in various directions by Obstfeld (1980), Girton and Henderson (1977), Allen and Kenen (1980) and Kenen (1982). The model we shall look at is based upon Branson (1976) and Kouri (1976). This model is a simple version of many portfolio balance models because it utilizes the assumption of static exchange rate expectations; that is, the exchange rate is not expected to change. The _Es_ ˙ expression in equation (8.1) is assumed to be zero.

In the model outlined we assume that domestic prices and output are !xed following a policy disturbance.

Tis means the focus of the analysis is on the accumulation or decumulation of foreign assets resulting from

imbalances in the current account following an operation to influence the exchange rate. A current account

surplus means that the country is building up a stock of claims on the rest of the world, as represented by

increased holdings of foreign bonds; while a de!cit in the balance of payments corresponds to a decline in

foreign bond holdings. Te operation of the portfolio balance model is shown in Figure 8.1.

An OMO, FXO or SFXO creates a disturbance in asset-holders' portfolios requiring a change in the

exchange rate and domestic interest rate. Tese changes then lead to e$ects on output and the current account.

A current account surplus/de!cit leads to an accumulation/decumulation of foreign assets, which leads to

further changes in assets-holders' portfolios with implications for the exchange rate and domestic interest

rate, and so on until the model is restored to long-run equilibrium.

In the model that follows, we can distinguish between OMOs and FXOs because domestic and foreign

bonds are assumed to be imperfect substitutes. Tis means that an SFXO which represents the di$erence

- f an FXO and an OMO becomes feasible. Te model follows the portfolio balance framework developed
by Branson and the analysis focuses on a 'small country' in the sense that it can influence its real exchange
rate without provoking a reaction from the rest of the world. Tis assumption enables the derivation of some

181

International Finance

**Figure 8.1** Te operation of the portfolio balance model

concrete results; the point that the foreign country's reaction may reinforce or o$set the policy pursued by the

home country is self-evident. In addition, because the domestic economy is small, its assets are assumed not

to be of any interest to the rest of the world and hence they are held only by domestic residents.

Tere are a number of simplifying assumptions that we shall make at the outset: that both the domestic and

foreign price levels and the real domestic output are !xed. We do, however, discuss the possible implications

- f OMOs, FXOs and SFXOs on real output in section 8.10.

_The model_

Tere are assumed to be three assets that are held in the portfolios of private agents and the authorities:

1. Domestic monetary base, _M_ ;
2. Domestic bonds denominated only in the domestic currency, _B_ ;
3. Foreign bonds denominated only in the foreign currency, _F_ .

Domestic bonds may be held by either domestic private agents or the authorities. Tus, we may denote the net

supply of domestic bonds which is assumed to be !xed as:

_B_              - Bp              - Ba (8.2)

where _B_ is the !xed net supply of domestic bonds, _B_ p is the domestic bond holdings of private agents and _B_ a

is the domestic bond holdings of the authorities.

Similarly, the country's net holding of foreign bonds is held by private agents and the authorities, which we

assume in our analysis to be positive in both cases and equal to the summation of previous current account

surpluses. Unlike the stock of domestic bonds, the holdings of foreign assets may be increased or decreased

- ver time via a current account surplus or de!cit. Tus, we have:

_F_               - _F_               - _R_ (8.3)

_p_

where _F_ is the net foreign bond holdings of the country, _Fp_ is the foreign bond holdings of private agents and

_R_ is the stock of foreign bonds held by the authorities as foreign exchange reserves.

182

The Portfolio Balance Model

Te domestic monetary base liability of the authorities is equivalent to the assets of the authorities

so%that:

_M_         - _Ba_         - _SR_ (8.4)

where _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, _SR_ is the exchange

rate ( _S_ ) times the reserves ( _R_ ). For simplicity it is assumed that capital gains or losses to the authorities as a

result of exchange rate changes do not a$etc the monetary base.

Total private !nancial wealth ( _W_ ) at any point in time is given by the identity:

_W_         - _M_         - _Bp_         - _SFp_ (8.5)

An important point concerning equation (8.5) is that the domestic currency value of foreign bonds is

given by the value of foreign bonds times the exchange rate, de!ned as domestic currency units per unit

- f foreign currency; that is, _SFp_ . Tis means that an excess demand for foreign bonds can be partly met by
a depreciation (rise) of the domestic currency which raises the domestic currency value of foreign bond
holdings.

Te demand to hold money by the private sector is inversely related to the domestic interest rate, inversely

related to the expected rate of return on foreign bonds, and positively related to domestic income and wealth.

Tis yields:

_M_       - _m r_ (, _E Ys_ ,, _W m_ ) r       - 0, _m_ s        - 0, _m_ y       - 0 _and m_ w� 0 (8.6)

where _r_ is the domestic nominal interest rate, _Es˙_ is the expected rate of depreciation of the domestic currency,

_Y_ is domestic nominal income, and _m_ r, _m_ s˙, _m_ y and _m_ w are partial derivatives.

Te demand to hold domestic bonds as a proportion of private wealth is positively related to the domestic

interest rate, inversely related to the expected rate of return on foreign assets, inversely related to domestic

nominal income and positively related to wealth. Tis yields:

_B_ p          - _b r E_ (, _s_ , _Y W b_, ) r          - 0, _b_ s           - 0, _b_ y          - 0 _and_ _bw_          - 0 (8.7)

where _b_ r, bs˙, _b_ y and _b_ w are partial derivatives.

Te demand to hold foreign bonds is inversely related to the domestic interest rate, positively related to

the expected rate of return from holding foreign bonds, inversely related to domestic nominal income and

positively related to wealth. Tis yields:

_SF_ p           - _f r E Y W f_ (, _s_ ,, ) _r_           - 0 _,_ _fs_            - 0, _f_ y           - 0 _and_ _f_ w           - 0 (8.8)

where _f_ r, _f_ s˙, _f_ y and _f_ w are partial derivatives.

Since any increase in wealth is held as either money, bonds or foreign bonds, then the sum of the partial

elasticities with respect to wealth must sum to unity; this is known as the balance sheet constraint and is given

by the identity:

_m_ w             - _b_ w             - _f_ w             - 1 (8.9)

183

International Finance

Te balance sheet identity is coupled with the assumption that assets are gross substitutes, implying the

following constraints on the partial derivatives:

_m_ r            - _b_ r            - _f_ r            - 0 (8.10)

_m_ s             - _b_ s             - _f_ s             - 0 (8.11)

From equation (8.10), it can be inferred that the demand for domestic bonds is more responsive to the

domestic interest rate than foreign bond demand, while the demand for domestic bonds is less responsive

to the foreign bond yield than foreign bond demand. Also, from equation (8.11) it can be inferred that the

demand for domestic bonds is less responsive to the expected rate of return on foreign bonds than foreign

bond demand.

Te current account balance is crucial to the dynamics of the system because the current account surplus

gives the rate of accumulation of foreign assets. Tat is:

_F_

. _p_ _T_ _r_ *( _Fp_ _R_ ) (8.12)

_C_

dd _Ft_ p _F_ . _p_ _T_ _r_ *( _Fp_ _R_

p

d

where _C_ is the current account surplus measured in foreign currency, _T_ is the trade balance measured in

foreign currency and _r_ - is the foreign interest rate.

The current account is made up of two components: the revenue from net exports (the trade balance)

and interest rate receipts from net holdings of foreign assets. Net exports are assumed to be a positive

function of the real exchange rate, inversely related to domestic income via the marginal propensity. This

yields:

_T_             - _T S P Y_             - /,,� _T_ s             - 0 _and T_ y             - 0 (8.13)

where _P_ is the domestic price level and _T_ s and _T_ y are partial derivatives.

Te assumption that net exports are a positive function of the real exchange rate is quite strong because it

rules out the possibility that there may be an initial J-curve e$etc on the trade balance; the assumption implies

that the Marshall–Lerner condition always holds.

8.5 DERIVATION OF THE ASSET DEMAND FUNCTIONS

We now proceed to analyse the e$ects of OMOs, FXOs and SFXOs on the exchange rate and domestic interest

rate using a comparative static framework. To make things easier we set the initial value of the exchange rate

_S_ and level of wealth equal to unity. Taking the total di$erential of equation (8.5) we obtain:

_dW_           - _dM_           - _dB_           - _F dS_ p           - _S dF_ p (8.14)

184

The Portfolio Balance Model

Taking the total di$erentials of the asset market functions given by equations (8.6) to (8.8) we obtain:

_dM_        - _m dr_ r        - _m E_ s  _d s_         - _m_ w ( _dM_        - _dB_ p        - _F dS_ p        - _S dF_ p ) (8.15)

_dB_ p          - _b dr_ r          - _b dE_ s  _s_           - _b_ w ( _dM_          - _dB_ p          - _F dS_ p          - _S dF_ p ) (8.16)

_dSF_ p           - _f dr_ r           - _f_ s  _dEs_  + _f_ w ( _dM_           - _dB_ p           - _F dS_ p           - _S dF_ p ) (8.17)

Setting the le,-hand side of the above equations to zero and noting that because of static exchange rate

expectations _dEs˙_ = 0, we can obtain the slope of the various asset market schedules in the interest rate–

exchange rate plane.

_The money market schedule_

Te money market (MM) schedule in Figure 8.2 shows various combinations of the domestic interest rate for

which money supply is equal to money demand. Keeping the money supply !xed (d _M_ = O) and since d _Es_ ˙ = 0

from equation (8.15) we !nd that the MM schedule has a positive slope given by:

0 (8.18)

_The bond market schedule_

exchange rate for which the private bond supply is equal to the private bond demand. Keeping the private

bond supply !xed (d _B_ p = O) and d _Es_ ˙=0 in equation (8.16) we !nd that the BB schedule has a negative slope

given by:

_The foreign bond schedule_

Te foreign bond market (FF) schedule in Figure 8.2 shows various combinations of the domestic interest rate

and exchange rate for which the private holding of the foreign bond supply is equal to private foreign bond

demand. Keeping the private foreign bond supply !xed (d _Fp_ = 0) and since d _Es_ ˙=0 from equation (8.17) we

!nd that the FF schedule has a negative slope given by:

_dr_

_dS_

- (1� _fw_ ) - 0 (8.20)
_fr_

8.6 EQUILIBRIUM OF THE MODEL

Te asset market of the model is in equilibrium when all three asset markets, that is the money markets and

the domestic and foreign bond markets, clear at the appropriate domestic interest rate and exchange rate. Tis

is illustrated in Figure 8.2.

Te MM schedule depicts equilibrium in the domestic money market and is upward-sloping from le, to

right in the interest rate–exchange rate plane. Te reason for this is that a depreciation (rise) of the exchange

rate leads to an increase in the value of domestic residents' wealth as it raises the domestic currency value of

their holdings of foreign bonds. Tis being the case, they will wish to hold more domestic money, but given

the existing money stock the increased money demand can only be o$set by a rise in the domestic interest

rate. An increase in the money supply for a given exchange rate requires a fall in domestic interest rate to be

willingly held, implying a rightward shi, of the MM schedule.

Te BB schedule depicts equilibrium in the domestic bond market, and is downward-sloping from le, to

right. A depreciation by raising domestic wealth also leads to an increased demand for domestic bonds which,

given the existing stock of domestic bonds, can only be o$set by a fall in the domestic interest rate which will

reduce their attractiveness to investors. An increase in the domestic bond supply for a given exchange rate

requires a rise in the domestic interest rate for the bonds to be willingly held, implying a rightward shi, of

the BB schedule.

Finally, the FF schedule depicts equilibrium in the foreign bonds market, and slopes downward from le,

to right. A rise in the interest rate on domestic bonds makes them relatively more attractive as compared to

foreign bonds, inducing agents to sell foreign bonds to purchase domestic bonds, leading to an appreciation

- f the domestic currency. An increase in the supply of foreign bonds, given the assumption of a !xed foreign
interest rate and a given exchange rate, requires a fall in the domestic interest rate for the foreign bonds to be
willingly held, implying a le,ward shi, of the FF schedule.

186

The Portfolio Balance Model

Te FF schedule is steeper than the BB schedule on the assumption that changes in the domestic rate of

interest a$ect the demand for domestic bonds more than they influence the demand for foreign bonds. Te

di$erent slopes of the BB and FF schedules shows that the two assets are regarded by private agents as di$erent.

We will now proceed to examine the short-run e$ects of an FXO, OMO and SFXO respectively. In each

case, we shall assume that the operation is designed to produce a depreciation of the exchange rate so as to

improve the international competitiveness of the country.

8.7 THE EFFECTS OF AN FXO

With an expansionary FXO, the authorities purchase foreign bonds from the private sector with the newly

created monetary base. Tis means that there is an increase in the private sector's holdings of money and an

equivalent fall in their holdings of foreign bonds (d _M_ = – _S_ d _F_ p = _S_ d _R_ ). Te short-run e$ects of an FXO are

shown in Figure 8.3.

An FXO is an exchange of domestic money for foreign assets and will lead to a rightward shi, of the

MM and FF schedules. Since agents hold fewer foreign assets than before the operation, we know that the

exchange rate will have depreciated to _S_ 2 and the domestic interest rate must have fallen to _r_ 2 at point B on

the unchanged BB schedule. Te exchange rate depreciation is required because the FXO creates a shortage of

foreign assets in agents' portfolios which can only be satis!ed in the short run by a depreciation which raises

the domestic currency value of agents' remaining holdings of foreign assets; while the fall in the interest rate

is required to encourage agents to hold the increased money stock.

8.8 THE EFFECTS OF AN OMO

With an expansionary OMO, the authorities increase the private sector holdings of money and decrease its

holdings of domestic bonds by an equivalent amount; that is, d _M_ = –d _B_ p = d _B_ a. Te e$ects of an OMO are

shown in Figure 8.4.

In contrast to an FXO, an OMO leaves the FF schedule unchanged while leading to a rightward shi, of the

money supply schedule from M1 to M2 and a le,ward shi, of the BB schedule from B1 to B2. Tis means that

there is a depreciation of the exchange rate and a fall in the domestic interest rate. Tis is because the OMO

creates an excess supply of money in agents' portfolios which leads to an increased demand for both domestic

and foreign bonds; this results in a fall in the domestic interest rate and a depreciation of the currency which

raises the value of foreign bond holdings.

8.9 THE EFFECTS OF AN SFXO

One means of comparing the relative e$ects of an OMO and FXO in the model is to combine the two operations

by having an expansionary FXO and a contractionary OMO of an equivalent amount. Tat is, the authorities

!rst purchase foreign assets with the domestic money base then o$set the increase in the monetary base by

selling domestic bonds. Such an operation represents a sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market,

since it leaves the domestic monetary base unchanged (d _M_ = – _S_ d _F_ p and –d _M_ = d _B_ p so that – _S_ d _F_ p = d _B_ p), and

is tantamount to the authorities altering the currency composition of bonds held in private portfolios. Te

e$ects of an SFXO are illustrated in Figure 8.5.

**Figure 8.5** Te e$ects of a sterilized foreign exchange operation

Te SFXO has the e$ect of increasing the supply of domestic bonds, shi,ing the BB schedule to the right

from B1 to B2, whilst decreasing agents’ holdings of foreign assets, shi,ing the FF schedule to the right from

F1 to F2; the MM schedule remains unchanged because the domestic money base is le, una$ected. Te net

e$etc of the operation is a depreciation of the exchange rate and a rise in the rate of interest. Te exchange rate

depreciates because the SFXO causes a shortage of foreign assets in agents' portfolios requiring an exchange

rate depreciation to achieve the desired holdings. Te interest rate rises because the excess supply of domestic

bonds in agents' portfolios depresses domestic bond prices.

Te fact that an SFXO can have exchange rate and interest rate e$ects in the portfolio balance model stands in

marked contrast to the monetary models examined in Chapter 7. In the monetary models, domestic and foreign

bonds are perfect substitutes, so a swap of domestic for foreign bonds by the authorities is an exchange of identical

assets as far as private agents are concerned. Hence, there is no need for interest or exchange rate changes. In

contrast, in the context of the portfolio balance model domestic and foreign bonds are regarded by economic

agents as di$erent assets, and this being the case an SFXO that increases agents' holdings of domestic bonds

while decreasing agents' holdings of foreign bonds causes a disequilibrium in agents' portfolios. Agents !nd

themselves with more domestic bonds than they want and fewer foreign bonds, which means that their portfolio

is more exposed to domestic risks. Equilibrium for agents' portfolios is restored by a higher domestic interest

rate – which compensates for the increased risk due to increased domestic bond holdings – and a depreciation of

the exchange rate – which reduces risk exposure by revaluing the remaining holdings of foreign assets.

8.10 A COMPARISON OF AN FXO, OMO AND SFXO

Having analysed all three operations separately, we can compare and contrast the short-run e$ects of the three

- perations together, as shown in Figure 8.6.

**Figure 8.6** Di$ering e$ects of an FXO, OMO and SFXO

In the !gure we can see the contrasting e$ects of the three operations. Te e$ects of an OMO and FXO

- n the domestic interest rate and exchange rate are qualitatively similar; however, an FXO leads to a larger
depreciation of the exchange rate, while an OMO leads to a larger fall in the domestic interest rate. Te
rationale for this result is that an FXO leads to a fall in agents' holdings of foreign bonds, while an OMO does
not – consequently an FXO creates a greater excess demand for foreign bonds which is satis!ed only by a
stronger depreciation of the exchange rate. By contrast, an OMO creates a greater shortage of domestic bonds
creating a greater excess demand for bonds which is o$set only by a larger fall in the domestic interest rate.

In the model, real output has been assumed to be !xed and, while this has the advantage of yielding some

clear and useful insights, it is also worth briefly considering the e$ects of an OMO and FXO on real output.

Dan Lee (1983) analysed the dynamics of an FXO and OMO in a model where the level of output in the short

run is endogenously determined. Te question he attempted to answer was whether an OMO or FXO would

have a more expansionary e$etc on domestic output. Using a portfolio balance framework he, too, found

that an expansionary OMO lowers the domestic interest rate more than an FXO, while the latter leads to a

larger depreciation of the exchange rate. He assumed that domestic investment is inversely related to the real

domestic interest rate and net exports are positively related to the real exchange rate.

Lee found that because an OMO has more e$ect on the domestic interest rate, its expansionary e$etc

- n output depends relatively more than an FXO on the responsiveness of investment to the fall in the real
interest rate that follows the operation; while the e$ect of an FXO on real output depends relatively more
than an OMO on the e$etc of the real exchange rate depreciation on the trade account balance. Overall, an
expansionary OMO may or may not have a greater e$etc on output than an expansionary FXO. If the response

- f the trade balance to changes in the real exchange rate is relatively weak and slower than that of investment
to interest rate changes, it will be the case that an OMO has a stronger e$etc on output. If, however, the foreign
sector is large and highly responsive to the real exchange rate we may be able to say the opposite. Tus Lee

190

The Portfolio Balance Model

concluded that at the theoretical level one cannot say whether an FXO or OMO will have a more expansionary

e$etc on output without imposing restrictions on the relevant parameters.

When comparing an FXO with an SFXO we !nd that the latter has a relatively weaker e$ect on the exchange

rate than in the case of an FXO; furthermore, the interest rate e$ects are opposite in sign. Te reason for

these di$ering e$ects is that an FXO increases the money stock which, by lowering the domestic interest

rate, encourages a greater excess demand for foreign assets leading to a greater depreciation. By contrast, an

SFXO increases the stock of domestic bonds requiring a higher domestic interest rate which, by reducing the

attractiveness of holding foreign bonds, limits the exchange rate depreciation.

In contrast to an FXO, the e$ects of an SFXO on real output will be ambiguous. Tis is because, while the

exchange rate depreciation will encourage net exports, the rise in the domestic interest rate will discourage

domestic investment. Even if the former outweighs the latter e$etc, so that there is a net increase in domestic

- output, the expansion will be less than in the case of an FXO because the exchange rate e$etc is weaker.

8.11 THE DYNAMICS OF THE MODEL

To distinguish between short-run and long-run equilibrium in the model we should note that in the long

run the current account should be in balance and the rate of change of the exchange rate should be zero. Tis

means that the country is neither increasing nor decreasing its foreign bond holdings and the exchange rate

is at its equilibrium value. Figure 8.7 illustrates the dynamics of the exchange rate and current account in the

model following an OMO, FXO or SFXO that causes an exchange rate depreciation, assuming that real output

remains !xed.

At time _t_ 1 there is an OMO, FXO or SFXO that causes a depreciation of the exchange rate from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2; with

prices !xed this means that there has been a real exchange rate depreciation. Te resulting improvement in the

country's international competitiveness moves its current account into surplus. A counterpart to the current

account surplus is that the country starts to accumulate more foreign bonds. Tis increases the proportion

- f foreign assets in the portfolios of investors, who, to reduce this risk exposure, start to purchase domestic
assets (most probably domestic bonds rather than money), leading to an appreciating exchange rate. In turn,
the exchange rate appreciation erodes the country's competitive advantage and so reduces the current account
surplus. Te dynamics come to an end when the exchange rate has appreciated sufficiently that the current
account is brought back into balance.

International Finance

One of the features of the model is that it is long-run and non-neutral with respect to the real exchange rate,

since the long-run exchange rate _S_ lies below the initial exchange rate _S_ 1. Tis is because the current account

surplus that follows an operation results in an accumulation of foreign assets and an accompanying increase

in the contribution of interest rate receipts from the holding of foreign assets on the service component of

the current account. As such, it is necessary for the real exchange rate to have appreciated in the long-run

equilibrium so that there is a deterioration of the trade account to o$set the improvement in the service

account and so ensure that the current account is restored to balance in the long run.

During the transition from the short run to the long run, the economy experiences an appreciating

currency and a current account surplus. Kouri (1983) labels this link the 'acceleration hypothesis'. It is worth

noting that the stable transition to equilibrium we have described depends crucially upon certain stability

conditions being ful!lled. Following an operation that causes an exchange rate depreciation which moves the

current account into surplus, there are two conflicting e$ects at work on the current account. First, the surplus

will induce an exchange rate appreciation which will work to eliminate the surplus. But, second, the current

account surplus also implies an accumulation of foreign assets and with it increased interest rate receipts

which improves the surplus. Consequently, for the appreciation of the exchange rate to reduce the surplus it is

necessary that the fall in net exports exceeds the increased interest receipts.

8.12 THE EFFECTS OF A CHANGE IN RISK PERCEPTIONS

A key feature of the portfolio balance model is that it provides a role for risk factors to influence exchange

rates which may account for some of the exchange rate changes experienced under floating exchange rates.

Consider the case where for some reason investors perceive that foreign bonds have become more risky as

compared to domestic bonds. Te e$ects of such a change in perceptions is illustrated in Figure 8.8.

Interest rate

_r_ 1

_r_ 2

**Figure 8.8** Foreign bonds become more risky

192

The Portfolio Balance Model

As a result of the perceived increase in risks attached to holding foreign bonds there is a decreased demand

for them and an increased demand for domestic bonds. Both the foreign bonds schedule F1 and the domestic

bonds schedule B1 shi, to the le, and the new schedules F2 and B2 intersect at point B. Te increased demand

_S_ to _S_ and a fall in the domestic

for domestic bonds is reflected in an appreciation of the exchange rate from 1 2

interest rate from _r_ 1 to _r_ 2.

Te exchange rate appreciation leads to a current account de!cit, which in turn leads to a decline in

foreign asset holdings which creates a shortage of foreign bonds in agents' portfolios who consequently try to

purchase foreign bonds leading to a depreciation of the exchange rate. Over time, the depreciation improves

the country's international competitiveness, so reducing the current account de!cit.

8.13 MONEY VERSUS BOND-FINANCED FISCAL EXPANSION

Tere are two ways that authorities may try to !nance increased government expenditure: one is by simply

printing extra money and using the money to directly !nance its expenditure; the other is to !nance

expenditure by borrowing, that is, by selling bonds to economic agents.

We now proceed to examine the short-run implications of these two alternative methods of !nancing

increased government expenditure within the context of the portfolio balance model. In the analysis we

shall ignore the possible expansionary e$ects of the increased expenditure on national income since this

considerably complicates the picture.

_Money-financed expenditure_

An increase in public expenditure !nanced by printing money means that investors will !nd that their wealth

has risen because they will hold more money and the same amounts of domestic and foreign bonds. Te problem

is that they will !nd that they have a larger proportion of money in their portfolios, and for this reason they

will demand more domestic and foreign bonds; the results of this portfolio adjustment are shown in Figure 8.9.

to

Te increased money supply is reflected in a rightward shi, of the money market schedule from M1

M2. It is worth noting that this shi, is less than in the case of an OMO which increases the money by a like

amount because the money supply increases wealth, a part of which is reflected in an increase in the demand

for money. In addition, the increase in wealth leads to an increase in the demand for both domestic and

foreign bonds: the bond market schedule shi,s to the le, from B1 to B2, while the foreign bond schedule shi,s

to the right. Te net e$etc of the money-based expansion is a depreciation of the exchange rate and a fall in

the domestic interest rate.

_Bond-financed expenditure_

An increase in public expenditure !nanced by borrowing will again increase investors' wealth because they

will hold more bonds and the same amounts of domestic money and foreign bonds. While the bond sales

reduce the public holdings of money, the money is then put back into private agents' hands by increased

government expenditure. In this instance, agents will !nd that they have a larger proportion of domestic

bonds in their portfolios than desired, which will lead investors to demand more money and foreign bonds;

the results of this portfolio adjustment are shown in Figure 8.10.

Te increase in the supply of bonds will shi, the BB schedule to the right from B1 to B2. Since investors

are holding more bonds and the same amount of money and foreign bonds their wealth must have

increased. Tis increase in wealth will lead to an increase in the demand for bonds, so reducing the extent

- f the rightward shi, of the bond schedule, and an increase in the demand for money, represented by a
le,ward shi, of the MM schedule. Te net e$etc on the demand for foreign bonds is uncertain. While the
rise in wealth will lead to increased foreign-bond demand, leading to a shi, of the foreign bond schedule
to the right, the rise in the domestic interest rate will lead to a substitution of demand away from foreign
bonds.

If the wealth e$ect dominates, the FF schedule moves to the right as in Figure 8.10(a) and equilibrium

is obtained at a higher interest rate and an exchange rate depreciation. Conversely, if the interest rate e$etc

dominates, the FF schedule moves to the right as in Figure 8.10(b), though equilibrium is obtained at a

higher interest rate and an exchange rate appreciation. Tus, !scal policy will have an ambiguous e$etc on the

exchange rate.

In this section we have seen that the impact of !scal expansion on the interest rate and exchange rate

depends not only on the size of the expansion but on how the policy is !nanced. If it is !nanced by

printing money this leads to a short-run depreciation and a fall in interest rates; while if it is !nanced by

borrowing, the e$ect is a rise in interest rates and the exchange rate may depreciate or appreciate. It is

important to remember that these are only the short-run results. Te money-!nanced !scal expansion

is likely to translate quickly into inflation as the expansionary !scal policy will be further boosted by the

exchange rate depreciation and the fall in the domestic interest rate. On the other hand, the e$ects of a

bond-!nanced !scal expansion on prices and output are likely to be less inflationary, because in the case

where the exchange rate depreciates the expansion of demand will be reined back to some extent by the

rise in interest rates. Demand will be even further restrained if the !scal expansion leads to an exchange

rate appreciation. In summary, a bond-!nanced !scal expansion will be less inflationary than a money!nanced expansion.

Before concluding this section, it is worth remembering that the rising US budget de!cit in the early 1980s

was primarily !nanced by US government bond sales, a rising US interest rate and an appreciating dollar. In

the context of the portfolio balance model this would suggest that the substitution e$ect of rising US interest

rates dominated the wealth e$etc as depicted in Figure 8.10. However, the more recent American !scal de!cits

since the start of the credit crunch in 2007 have involved quantitative easing (QE 1, QE 2 and QE 3) and the

printing of money, which has involved a falling US interest rate and a depreciating dollar, which is reflected

in Figure 8.9.

8.14 THE RISK PREMIUM, IMPERFECT AND PERFECT SUBSTITUTABILITY

Te portfolio balance model that we have examined in this chapter has been based upon the assumption

that domestic and foreign bonds are imperfect substitutes. Tis is shown by the fact that, although the

foreign interest rate is !xed and exchange rate expectations are static, the domestic interest rate could

diverge from the foreign interest rate. Te reason for this is that the di$ering operations influence the risk

premium, allowing the domestic interest rate to diverge from the foreign rate. Tis point is illustrated as

follows.

In the portfolio balance model the domestic interest rate can diverge from the foreign interest rate not only

because of exchange rate expectations, but also because of the risk premium, in accordance with equation

(8.1), which is repeated below as equation (8.21):

_r_                     - _r_                     -                     - _Es_                      - _RP_ (8.21)

Tis can be expressed in di$erence form as:

d _r_              - d _r_              -              - d _Es_               - d _RP_ (8.22)

Troughout we have been assuming static exchange rate expectations (d _Es_ ˙=0) and a !xed foreign interest rate

so that d _r_ - = 0. Substituting these values into equation (8.22) we !nd:

195

International Finance

d _r_ = d _RP_ (8.23)

Hence, all changes in the domestic interest rate can be interpreted as due to changes in the risk premium.

A rise in the interest rate reflects a rise in the risk premium on domestic assets, while a fall in the domestic

interest rate reflects a fall in the risk premium. In the case of perfect substitutability there is no risk premium,

so the UIP condition is the relevant equation, that is:

_r_                       - _r_                       -                       - _Es_  (8.24)

In di$erence form:

d _r_               - d _r_               -               - d _Es_  (8.25)

With static expectations and a !xed foreign interest rate this means:

d _r_ = 0 (8.26)

For this to be the case, both the BB and FF schedules must coincide and be horizontal at the world interest

rate _r_ *, as illustrated in Figure 8.11.

The Portfolio Balance Model

In the !gure, the BB and FF schedules are horizontal and coincide as represented by the schedule BF;

- nly changes in monetary policy as reflected by shi,s in the MM schedule can influence the exchange
rate. Tere is no distinction to be made between an OMO or FXO on the exchange rate. An SFXO leaves
the MM schedule unchanged and the BF schedule remains in the same position so that it has no exchange
rate or interest rate e$ects. A bond-!nanced !scal expansion will in this special case have an unambiguous
e$etc. Although the BF schedule remains at BF, the increased wealth resulting from the increased supply

- f bonds will raise money demand causing a le,ward shi, of the MM schedule and an exchange rate
appreciation.

8.15 CONCLUSIONS

Te portfolio balance model represents an important contribution to the exchange rate literature because

it allows a role for changes in perceived risk or risk-aversion in the determination of the exchange rate. An

increase in the perceived riskiness of domestic bonds compared to foreign bonds can lead to both a rise in

the domestic interest rate and a depreciation of the currency; while an increase in the perceived riskiness of

foreign bonds can lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency and a fall in the domestic interest rate.

Tese e$ects accord with intuition and are frequently invoked to explain observed exchange rate changes.

Such e$ects are, however, absent from the monetary models which assume that domestic and foreign bonds

are perfect substitutes.

Another important contribution of the portfolio balance model is that there is a signi!cant role for the

current account to play in the determination of the exchange rate over time. A current account surplus

implies an accumulation of foreign assets and an increase in wealth, and the result is a larger proportion of

foreign bonds in investors' portfolios than they desire. In turn, this leads to purchases of domestic bonds

and money and a resulting appreciation of the exchange rate which works to reduce the current account

surplus.

Another contribution of the portfolio balance model is that it permits a relatively easy discussion of the

role of !scal policy in determining the exchange rate. A bond-!nanced !scal expansion has an ambiguous

e$ect on the exchange rate, because, while a higher proportion of domestic bonds and an increase in assetholders’ wealth will lead to an increase in the demand for foreign bonds, the higher domestic interest rate will

lead to a fall in the demand for foreign bonds. If the former e$etc is greater than the latter the exchange rate

depreciates, but if the reverse is true the exchange rate appreciates.

A signi!cant policy implication that emerges from the portfolio balance model is that a given change in

the money stock has a more powerful e$ect on the exchange rate when carried out by a purchase of foreign

assets (an FXO) than when achieved via a purchase of domestic assets (an OMO). It is only in the limiting

case when domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes that the e$ects become identical. Tis is an

important result because it at least provides a rationale for the observed interventions of authorities in foreign

exchange markets.

Another result that emerges is that it is only by assuming that domestic and foreign bonds are imperfect

substitutes that an SFXO can exert exchange rate e$ects. However, even if an SFXO can a$etc the exchange

rate, it will have a relatively weaker e$ect on the exchange rate than an FXO. Te lesson for policy-makers is

that non-sterilized intervention has a more powerful e$etc on the exchange rate than sterilized intervention.

197

International Finance

One issue that is not explicitly dealt with by the portfolio balance model is the precise reason for the

perceived di$erences in risks between domestic and foreign bonds. Tis can be caused amongst other

things by unstable economic policies and di$ering perceived political risks. In the circumstance where

unstable economic policies create the risks, it may be best that the authorities stabilize their economic

policies. Where political risks are concerned the authorities might consider ways of reducing the perceived

risks. In summary, reducing perceived risks may be an important mechanism for reducing exchange rate

fluctuations.
