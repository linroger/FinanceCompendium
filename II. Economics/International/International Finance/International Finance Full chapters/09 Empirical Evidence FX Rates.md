9.1 INTRODUCTION

We have so far considered the exchange rate literature from a predominately theoretical viewpoint, but the

exchange rate !eld has also been rich in empirical research. Apart from investigations into the validity of PPP

theory which we examined in Chapter 6, empirical research on exchange rates has addressed three other key

questions:

Is the foreign exchange market efficient?

2. What model best predicts exchange rate movements?
3. How can we model the expectations of participants in the exchange market?

Answers to these questions are of enormous importance from a policy viewpoint. If it can be shown that

the foreign exchange market is 'efficient' then the case for government intervention in that market would be

considerably undermined. On the other hand, if we can identify a model that successfully explains exchange

rate determination, it would be possible for the authorities to determine the best way to influence exchange

rates and limit their volatility. Furthermore, the consequences of alternative economic policy measures could

be better evaluated as their implications for the exchange rate would be understood. Finally, if we understood

how the participants in the exchange market form their views on exchange rates, then policy-makers may be

able to use such information to help them in the process of stabilizing those rates.

9.2 WHAT IS AN EFFICIENT MARKET?

Following Eugene Fama (1970, p. 383), an efficient market is conventionally de!ned as one 'in which prices

always "fully reflect" available information'. In the speci!c application to the foreign exchange market this

implies that market participants use all relevant available information bearing on the appropriate value of the

exchange rate to produce a set of exchange rates – spot and forward – that does not provide an opportunity for

unusual _ex ante_ pro!t opportunities. In other words, unusual pro!t cannot be made by speculators who make

exchange rate forecasts on a similar information set. In connection with this broad de!nition, there are two

key concerns. Is new information instantaneously and fully reflected in the exchange rate? What is relevant

and what is irrelevant information?

Tere are a number of tests that have been proposed to determine whether or not the foreign exchange

market is efficient. One of the most popular has been to see if the forward exchange rate systematically over

- r underpredicts the future spot exchange rate; if it were to do so then this would be indicative of foreign
exchange market inefficiency.

For example, suppose that the forward exchange rate were to systematically underpredict the value of the

future spot rate of a currency. Ten there would be a simple rule which could yield the speculator abnormal

pro!ts: buy the currency forward today, knowing that he can sell it when the contract is due at a higher value.

A numerical example will illustrate the point. Suppose the three-month forward rate of the dollar against

the euro is $1.30/€1, and suppose that speculators know that this forward rate systematically underpredicts

the future rate by 5%. Tis means that the future spot exchange rate in three months’ time will be above

$1.30/€1 at $1.365/€1. Hence, by buying euros forward today for $1.30/€1 a speculator will know that in three

months' time, when he is due to pay the $1.30/€1, for each euro purchased forward he can immediately expect

$1.365/€1 for each euro sold in the spot market at the time of ful!lment of the forward contract.

According to the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) the scenario depicted above would not persist because

the opportunity for abnormal pro!ts would lead to massive purchases of euros forward. Tis would lead to a

rise in the forward rate above $1.30/€1 towards $1.365/€1 until any abnormal pro!ts are eliminated.

However, there is a major problem with exchange market efficiency tests. Even if one were to discover that

the forward rate systematically overor underpredicted the future spot rate, this discrepancy is not necessarily

a sign of foreign exchange market inefficiency: it could be indicative of the existence of a risk premium in

the foreign exchange market. If the forward exchange rate of a currency were systematically to underpredict

its future spot exchange rate, as in our numerical example, this may be due to the existence of a positive risk

premium attached to the foreign currency. In our numerical example, the di$erence between the forward rate

- f $1.30/€1 and the actual/expected future spot rate of $1.365/€1 may be viewed as a $0.065 risk premium on
the euro; that is, speculators will only buy euros forward if they expect to be able to sell them in the future
and make $0.065 pro!t. Tis pro!t represents the compensation required by speculators to buy euros forward
which are regarded as more risky than dollars.

Hence, any expected excess pro!ts to be earned on buying the foreign currency forward are merely the

compensation required by an efficient foreign exchange market to compensate for the risks associated with

holding the foreign currency forward. If the forward exchange rate of the foreign currency is systematically

undervalued in relation to the future spot exchange rate, this may be evidence of the existence of a positive risk

premium attached to the foreign currency. Tat is, international investors require a higher expected return on

the foreign currency as compared to the domestic currency because they regard it as a relatively risky asset to

hold compared to the domestic currency. A positive risk premium on the foreign currency corresponds to a

negative risk premium on the domestic currency, and vice versa.

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

9.3 EXCHANGE MARKET EFFICIENCY TESTS

Te rational expectations hypothesis (REH) is particularly useful when examining the concept of exchange

market efficiency. Tis is because, like the EMH, it presumes that economic agents do not make systematic

errors when making their predictions. According to the REH, economic agents have a good knowledge of the

economic model relevant to predicting a variable so that they do not persistently overor underpredict the

future value of that variable. Applying rational expectations to the prediction of the future exchange rate we

!nd:

_s_ t 1� [�] _Es_ t                          - 1                          - _u_ t 1� (9.1)

where _s_ t+1 is the log of the actual spot exchange rate in one period's time de!ned as domestic currency units

per unit of foreign currency, _Es_ t+1 is the log of the expected exchange rate in one period's time and _u_ t+1 is a

random error term with a normal distribution and mean of zero.

Equation (9.1) says that the actual future exchange rate corresponds to that which was anticipated by

economic agents plus or minus some random error. Te next step is to assume that investors are risk-neutral

(that is, there is no risk premium) and so set the forward rate at a level that corresponds to the expected future

spot exchange rate. Tis gives:

_f_ t                                 - _Es_ t 1� (9.2)

where _f_ t is the log of the forward exchange rate at time _t_, de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign

currency. Substituting equation (9.2) into equation (9.1) we obtain:

_s_ t 1� [�] _f_ t                          - _ut_                          - 1 (9.3)

Equation (9.3) states that, providing economic agents have rational expectations and there is no risk premium

in the foreign exchange market, then the future spot rate should be equal to today's quoted forward rate plus

a random error. In other words, on average the forward rate should neither overnor underpredict the actual

exchange rate.

Equation (9.3) constitutes a joint test of both exchange market efficiency and no risk premium. Te forward

rate may systematically overor underpredict the future actual exchange rate not because of exchange market

inefficiency, but because there is a positive or negative risk premium on the domestic currency. If a risk

premium is present we have to modify equation (9.2) to yield:

_Es_ t 1� [�] _f_ t                    - _RP_ t (9.4)

where _RP_ t is the risk premium on the foreign currency.

Substituting equation (9.4) into (9.1) yields:

_s_ t                          - 1                          - _f_ t                          - _RP_ t                          - _ut_                          - 1 (9.5)

Equation (9.5) says that the forward rate may systematically overor underpredict the future spot rate because

- f the presence of a risk premium. If there is a positive risk premium on the foreign currency (negative
risk premium on the domestic currency) the one-period-ahead forward rate of the domestic currency will
systematically overvalue the domestic currency as compared to its actual rate one period ahead; whereas if
there is a negative risk premium on the foreign currency (positive risk premium on the domestic currency)
then the one-period-ahead forward rate of the domestic currency will systematically undervalue the currency
compared to its actual rate one period ahead.

Te early tests (see for example Levich, 1978 and Frenkel, 1982) of exchange market efficiency were based

- n equation (9.3) and set out as follows:

_s_ t 1�                          - _a_ 1                          - _a f_ 2 t                          - _u_ t 1� (9.6)

According to this test, if the foreign exchange market is efficient in the sense that the exchange rate (spot

and forward) incorporates all currently available information and there is no risk premium in the foreign

exchange market, then the forward rate will be an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Hence,

the expected sign of _a_ 1 is zero. If it were non-zero then the forward exchange rate would systematically over

- r underpredict the future spot exchange rate and rational economic agents could use this information to
make systematic pro!ts. Te coefficient _a_ 2 will be equal to unity showing that the forward exchange rate on
average correctly predicts the future spot exchange rate. Finally, the error term ( _u_ t) will possess the classical

- rdinary least squares properties. In particular, errors will be serially uncorrelated. By 'no serial correlation'
we mean that there is no statistically signi!cant relationship between the errors of one period and errors
made in other periods. One cannot forecast future errors on the basis of past errors. If agents could predict
future errors on the basis of past errors this would be a sign of foreign exchange market inefficiency; that is,
there would be unexploited pro!t opportunities. Te results of some of the studies of Levich and Frenkel for
equation (9.6) are reported in Table 9.1.

Te results presented in Table 9.1 were interpreted by the two authors as highly supportive of the joint

_a_ does not di$er

hypothesis of foreign exchange market efficiency and no risk premium. Te coefficient 1

signi!cantly from zero, while the coefficient _a_ 2 does not di$er signi!cantly from unity. In addition, the Durbin–

Watson statistic reveals that there is no !rst-order serial correlation in the residuals. Te adjusted R [2] for the

entire sample period is generally high, suggesting that most information is incorporated in the forward rate.

Te implication of these results is that the foreign exchange market is efficient and there is no risk premium.

Nevertheless, other authors, such as Hansen and Hodrick (1980), Meese and Singleton (1982) and Cumby

and Obstfeld (1984), have pointed out that the Levich/Frenkel regression is inappropriate if exchange rates

follow a non-stationary process – that is, there is some trend exchange rate appreciation or depreciation. In

this case, it is necessary to detrend the data in order for the regression estimates to be unbiased. Cumby and

Obstfeld argue that we should re-estimate the previous equation by running the following regression:

                          - _s_ t 1�                           - _s_ t                           -                           - _a_ 1                           - _a_ 2                           - _f_ t                           - _s_ t                           -                           - _u_ t 1� (9.7)

where _s_ t is the log of the spot exchange rate.

Equation (9.7) detrends equation (9.3) and as such constitutes a more powerful test of the EMH. It states

that a currency that is at a forward discount ( _f_ t– _s_ t) of _x_ % should on average depreciate by _x_ %, whereas a

currency that is at a forward premium ( _f_ t– _s_ t) of _x_ % should on average appreciate by _x_ %.

If the foreign exchange market is efficient and characterized by rational expectations, so that we can

substitute the actual exchange rate for the expected exchange rate, along with the assumption that there is no

risk premium, then one would again expect _a_ 1 to be zero and the coefficient _a_ 2 not to di$er signi!cantly from

unity, indicating that on average the realized change in the exchange rate is correctly forecast by the forward

premium/discount. Table 9.2 reports the results of Olmo and Pilbeam (2011) on equation (9.7) for a variety

- f currencies against the US dollar.

Te results of Olmo and Pilbeam, which con!rm the earlier !ndings of Boothe and Longworth (1986),

Cumby and Obstfeld (1984), Taylor (1989) and many other authors, reported in Table 9.2 show that one can

decisively reject the null hypothesis of exchange market efficiency on simple econometric grounds. Tese

results reveal that, once we take account of the trend in the exchange rate, market participants have on average

mispredicted the direction of movement of the exchange rate. As MacDonald and Torrance (1989) note in

a survey of these tests, the coefficient a2 is usually closer to minus one than the hypothesized value of unity!

Te tests of equation (9.7) suggest that on average currencies that were at a forward discount actually

appreciated, while those at a forward premium actually depreciated! Tis is a clear rejection of the joint

market efficiency test because it suggests that there exists a fairly simple rule for investors to make excessive

pro!ts – simply put, your money in a currency that is at a forward discount (because of the relatively high

interest rate in that country) and you will not only bene!t from the higher interest rate but also an exchange

rate appreciation of that currency. Tis is a clear violation of UIP.

A major problem with these decisive rejections is that because they are a joint test of exchange market

efficiency (rational expectations) and the non-existence of a risk premium, there is no clear-cut interpretation.

It may be evidence of exchange market inefficiency (that is, REH does not hold) or be indicative of the existence

- f a risk premium (possibly time-varying) in the foreign exchange market.

Tere has been some questioning of the econometric results of the 'called-forward discount puzzle' and

its economic signi!cance. For example Sarno et al. (2006) suggest that the linear relationship imposed by

using conventional linear regressions to test for UIP may not be appropriate due to non-linearities in the

data. Once these non-linearities are taken into account, they conclude (p. 476) 'that while UIP does not hold

most of the time, deviations from UIP are generally economically small'. Indeed, authors such as Olmo and

Pilbeam (2011) have shown that the negative _a_ 2 coefficients do not necessarily imply that excess pro!ts can

be made by borrowing in the low interest rate currency and putting it in the high interest rate currency as the

regression seems to imply. In addition, research by Lothian and Wu (2011), a,er looking at a data set covering

two centuries, suggests that, while there can be departures from UIP for sustained periods of time, in the long

run UIP is far more likely to hold and the negative beta coefficient is likely to be positive and close to unity.

**Box 9.1 Exchange market efficiency and the distinction between anticipated**
**and unanticipated economic policy**

Te EMH has some important implications for exchange rate dynamics in response to changes in

economic policy. Let us consider the case of monetary policy. When the foreign exchange market is

efficient it is only unanticipated monetary expansion that can cause discrete jumps in the exchange

rate. If a monetary expansion is anticipated to occur, market efficiency implies that there would be

no discrete jump in the exchange rate when the money supply expansion takes place because it has

already been appropriately discounted in advance. Figure 9.1 contrasts the e$ects of unanticipated and

anticipated money expansions in the context of the overshooting exchange rate model.

Figure 9.1(a) illustrates what happens if a money supply expansion takes place unannounced at time

_t_ 2, leading to a sudden discrete jump of the exchange rate from S1 to S2 which represents an 'overshoot'

from its long-run equilibrium rate _S_ ; therea,er, it tends back to the long-run value. Tis contrasts with

the dynamics of the exchange rate when the authorities announce at time _t_ 1 that they will expand the

money supply at time _t_ 2, which is shown in Figure 9.1(b). In this case, there would be an immediate

initial depreciation at the time of the announcement _t_ 1 to _S_ 2 which is followed by a gradual depreciation

204

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

9.4 ALTERNATIVE TESTS OF THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS

According to the EMH, the forward rate is supposed to embody all the relevant information concerning

the future expected spot exchange rate. Tis implies that it should not be possible to add a further variable

available at time _t_ to regression (9.3) which proves to be statistically signi!cant. Were it to do so, it could be

taken as evidence that the forward exchange rate does not contain all relevant information concerning the

205

International Finance

future spot exchange rate. An example of a regression that tests to see if another variable can improve the !t

- f regression (9.3) is:

_s_ t 1�                      - _a_ 1                      - _a f_ 2 t                      - _a f_ 3 t 1�                      - _u_ t 1� (9.8)

where _f_ t–1 is the log of the forward rate in the previous period.

According to the EMH a variable such as the previous period's forward exchange rate should not contain

any additional information relevant to the future exchange rate (that is, _a_ 3 should not be statistically di$erent

from zero). Using monthly data (July 1973 to September 1979) for the pound–dollar, French franc–dollar,

lira–dollar and Deutschmark–dollar, Edwards (1983b) found that the coefficient a3 is not statistically di$erent

from zero, suggesting that _f_ t–1 contains no useful additional information. Edwards' study is very supportive of

exchange market efficiency.

Another test of the EMH concerns an examination of the errors between the expected future exchange rate

and the actual future exchange rate. If the foreign exchange market is efficient then it should not be possible to

predict these errors on the basis of information available at the time the forecast is made. Tat is:

_u_ t 1�               - _a_ 1               - _a I_ 2 t               - _v_ t 1� (9.9)

where _u_ t+1 is the forecast error, that is _s_ t+1– _f_ t, _I_ t is a subset of information available at time _t_ ; and _v_ t+1 is a random

error term with a normal distribution and mean of zero.

If the foreign exchange market is efficient then the coefficient _a_ 2 should be equal to zero. Tat is, we cannot

put in any relevant economic variables at time _t_, such as the current spot exchange rate _s_ t, the previous period's

spot _s_ t–1 or lagged forward rate _f_ t–1, or any other known variable at time _t_ and use this to predict the error. Tis

efficiency test is known as the 'orthogonality property' and implies that agents use all relevant information in

making their forecasts so as to avoid predictable forecast errors. Te EMH holds that the forecast error _u_ t+1 is

due to unpredictable shocks and will be unrelated to any information available at the time expectations are

formed. Among the other information available at time _t_ is the previous period's forecast errors _u_ t. As such,

a test of the orthogonality assumption would be to see if the forecast error _s_ t+1– _f_ t = _u_ t+1 is independent of the

previous period's forecast error, _s_ t– _f_ t–1 = _u_ t. Tat is:

_s_ t 1�                       - _f_ t                       - _a_ 1                       - _a_ 2                       - _s_ t                       - _f_ t 1�                       -                       - _v_ t 1� (9.10)

where _v_ t+1 is a random normally distributed error.

Equation (9.10) can be rearranged to yield:

_s_ t 1�                       - _a_ 1                       - _a_ 2                       - _s_ t                       - _f_ t                       - 1                       -                       - _a f_ 3 t                       - _v_ t 1� (9.11)

According to the EMH if there is no risk premium and the foreign exchange market uses all information

efficiently then _a_ 1 = 0, _a_ 2 = 0 and _a_ 3 = 1. Frankel (1980) produces results for the French franc–dollar, pound–

dollar and Italian lira–dollar for the period July 1974–April 1978 using weekly data that leads to a rejection

- f the EMH.

Other tests of the EMH have been variations on the traditional tests. Most notably they have involved

using alternative proxies for the future expected exchange rate _Es_ t+1, other than the actual exchange rate at

time _t_ + 1. In addition, more sophisticated estimation techniques have been used, and two studies of particular

note are those of Clarida and Taylor (1997) and Clarida et al. (2003). Clarida and Taylor (1997), using a linear

framework, !nd that information from a series of forward exchange rates (4, 13, 26 and 52 weeks) can help to

beat a random walk forecast (that is, a forecast that the exchange rate one-period hence will be the same as the

current spot rate) by a margin of up to 40%. Clarida et al. (2003), using the same series of forward rates, and

non-linear techniques, show that there is information useful to forecasting the future spot exchange rate and

they are able to beat a random walk forecast by a margin of 27–31% at the four-week horizon and 5–68% at

the 52-week horizon, improving upon the linear framework of the Clarida and Taylor (1997) study. Finally, in

tests of the orthogonality property, authors have used a wider range of variables in the information set.

9.5 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS ON EXCHANGE MARKET EFFICIENCY

Tere has been a great deal of testing of the joint hypothesis of foreign exchange market efficiency and the

non-existence of a risk premium. Te problem with all these tests is that even when the joint hypothesis is

rejected there is no means of knowing whether this is due to the existence of a risk premium or due to the

failure of foreign exchange market efficiency.

Overall, the results of the various exchange market efficiency tests are fairly mixed depending upon the

currency and the particular test considered. Nonetheless, there is an accumulation of evidence suggesting

that for certain periods and certain rates the joint hypothesis does not hold. Speci!cally, tests of EMH using

the forward premium/discount as a prediction for the future appreciation/depreciation of the currency

convincingly reject the joint hypothesis.

Accepting that the joint hypothesis does not hold, then the big issue le, to resolve is whether or not the

rejection is due to the existence of a risk premium or the existence of inefficiency/non-rational expectations in

the foreign exchange market. At the theoretical level Frankel (1986) has argued that the risk premium if it does

exist is likely to be too small to account for the failure of exchange market efficiency tests. In addition, Frankel

(1986) and Rogo$ (1984) test to see if the risk premium behaves as predicted by the portfolio balance model;

that is, if it increases with the supply of domestic bonds and decreases with the supply of foreign bonds. In

both studies the relevant coefficients proved to be statistically insigni!cant.

A tentative suggestion is that the more likely candidate for the failure is not the existence of a risk premium

but, rather, non-rational expectations in the foreign exchange market. Indeed, Frankel and Froot (1987) suggest

that neither the rational expectations hypothesis nor alternative expectations hypotheses correctly specify

exchange market expectations, while preliminary research into this question by MacDonald and Torrance

(1989) and Taylor (1989) suggests that both the existence of a risk premium and non-rational expectations are

to blame. However, the success of papers such as Clarida and Taylor (1997) and Clarida et al. (2003) suggests

there may be information in the series of forward exchange rates that is useful for predicting the future path

- f the spot exchange rate, suggesting non-rational use of information.

9.6 EMPIRICAL TESTS OF EXCHANGE RATE MODELS

As we saw in Chapter 7, there are a variety of models of exchange rate determination for the authorities

to choose from, with radically di$erent implications for the conduct of exchange rate policy. In particular,

the monetary and portfolio balance models have very di$erent implications concerning the e$ectiveness of

sterilized intervention.

207

International Finance

Predictably, some authors have conducted empirical tests of their exchange rate model and found evidence

to support it, while others using either di$erent time periods or di$erent bilateral exchange rates have found

evidence against a given model. Another problem is that some authors have taken the empirical evidence

to support their exchange rate model when the same predictions are also made by rival theories. As we saw

in Chapter 7, in an attempt to overcome this latter problem, Frankel (1983, 1984) extended his monetary

synthesis equation (1979) to incorporate a portfolio balance e$etc. We repeat the synthesis equation (7.46)

below:

1 [�] 1 1� 1/ - � ( _m_ - _m_ *) - �1 1�/ - � ( _y_ - _y_ *) - 1 1���1/ /���

- - 1/ - � - � - 1

Te fully flexible price monetarist version postulates that both the parameters 1 and * approach in!nity,

which reduces equation (9.12) to the flexible price monetary equation (7.9) of Chapter 7. Te sticky-price

monetarist school holds that 1 is less than in!nite, while * is in!nite, so we end up with the real interest

di$erential equation (7.31), whereas the sticky-price portfolio balance model holds that both the parameters

- and 1 are less than in!nite, so that relative bond supplies have an impact on the exchange rate. Te relevant
equation is therefore (7.46) or (9.12).

Equation (9.12) yields the following reduced-form regression for the exchange rate:

_s_        - _a_ 1        - _a_ 2        - _m_        - _m_ *�        - _a_ 3 ( _y_        - _y_ *)        - _a_ 4 ( _r_        - _r_ *)        - _a_ 5 ( _Pe_         - _Pe_  *)        - _a_ 6 ( _b_        - _f_ )        - _ut_ (9.13)

Table 9.3 reveals the conflicting predictions of the four main models of exchange rate determination derived

from equation (9.13).

Te Frankel formulation shows that the theoretical predictions of the main models of exchange rate

determination are sufficiently di$erent that a resort to empirical testing should allow us to discriminate

between the various theories. Frankel tests his synthesis equation for the US dollar against the Deutschmark

using monthly data for the period January 1974–October 1978. In a similar vein, Pilbeam (1991) tests the

Frankel equation for the US dollar against the pound for the period January 1973 to December 1984. Results

from these two studies are reported in Table 9.4.

Te results reported in Table 9.4 are typical examples of most exchange rate tests. As we can see from the

reported regressions, the results, rather than favouring any particular model of exchange rate determination,

are not favourable to any. In the Frankel study the only variable to be signi!cant is the equation for relative

bond supplies but this is of the wrong sign! In the Pilbeam study, the only variable to be signi!cant is the money

stock but this is a prediction common to all three models. Te coefficient for real output is correctly signed in

the Pilbeam study, but incorrectly signed in the Frankel study, and statistically insigni!cant in both. As for the

nominal interest rate di$erential and expected inflation di$erential, the actual estimated coefficients were not

signi!cantly di$erent from zero, revealing that there is no clear-cut empirical relation between interest rates

and price expectations for either the dollar–Deutschmark or the dollar–pound exchange rate. Te regression

coefficient for the portfolio balance parameter is wrongly signed in both studies.

9.7 EXCHANGE RATE MODELS: A FORECASTING ANALYSIS

From the regression coefficients reported in Table 9.4, it is not possible to rank any of the alternative theories

derived from the Frankel synthesis equation. Although the regression coefficients provide very little support

for any of the theories this does not rule out the possibility that one of the exchange rate models may prove

209

International Finance

useful for forecasting purposes. In two important papers, Meese and Rogo$ (1983a, 1983b) have tested the

forecasting accuracy of popular exchange rate models. Teir test procedures and results have been replicated

by Pilbeam (1991) for the dollar–pound exchange rate and it is the results of that study which are reported here.

Tree models are tested: the flexible-price monetary model, the real-interest-di$erential model and the

sticky-price portfolio balance model. For the purposes of forecasting the exchange rate, the three models are

tested by using the variables which are deemed to be of interest from the Frankel synthesis equation, regardless

- f whether the coefficients proved statistically signi!cant or not. Pilbeam tests the forecasting accuracy of the
models for the period 1979:1 to 1988:3 using a quarterly data set.

In order to forecast the one-period-ahead exchange rate, a rolling regression technique was used, which meant

re-estimating the regression coefficients for each period _t_ to forecast the exchange rate in time _t_ + 1. For example,

to forecast the 1979:1 exchange rate, a regression for the period 1973:1 to 1978:4 was undertaken using the

coefficients deemed to be relevant by a given theory; these estimated coefficients were then used to forecast the

1979:1 exchange rate. Next, to forecast the 1979:2 exchange rate the regression was redone using data from 1973:1

to 1979:1 to re-estimate the coefficients, and these new estimates were then used to forecast the 1979:2 period

exchange rate, and so on. For the purposes of forecasting the exchange rate in time _t_ + 1, the actual values of the

exogenous (right-hand side) variables in time _t +_ 1 were used. Tis latter point is important because it means

that forecasts for one period ahead will not be based on the wrong money supplies, interest rates, etc., so that any

forecasting error is due to the weakness of the models rather than inaccurate forecasting of the fundamentals.

It is important to emphasize that for the purposes of forecasting it was the regression estimates of coefficients

that were employed and that these rarely corresponded to the theoretical values. For instance, the fully flexible

monetarist model predicts that the coefficient _a_ 2 for the money stock will be unity, but in the regressions it

hovered between 0.2 and 0.55, while for the portfolio balance model the coefficient for relative bond supplies was

persistently wrongly signed. Te purpose of the exercise was to see if any of the three models could be empirically

useful devices to forecast the exchange rate. Meese and Rogo$ (1983b) used plausible theoretical coefficient

values as opposed to the estimated coefficients for forecasting purposes, but their results were largely the same

as using the above procedure which is the basis of their (1983a) study. Table 9.5 shows the forecast values of the

exchange rate of the three alternative models tested in the Pilbeam study and the actual exchange rate.

For the purposes of ranking the forecasting accuracy of the three models, a commonly used statistical

measure known as the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) criterion was used. Te RMSE criterion compares

the predicted exchange rate with the actual exchange rate using the following formula:

          - 1 _n_ ( _st i_           -           -           - _st i_           - )
## Mean-squared error(MSE) [�]

_n_

- 2

## [�] i �1

_st i_ - - - _s_

_s_

_t i_ 

_t i_ - - _t i_ 

_n_ _i_ - 1 _st i_ 

where _n_ is the number of forecasts, _s_ t+i* is the predicted exchange rate for period _t_ + i at time _t_ and _s_ t+i is the

actual exchange rate in period _t_ + _i_ .

Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) = !wwMSE

Te lower the RMSE, the better the forecasting capability of the model. Te results of the RMSE test for the

three alternative exchange rate models are given below, and these results are compared with the RMSE of a

simple random-walk model of the exchange rate, whereby the current exchange rate at time _t_ is used as the

forecast for the exchange rate in period _t_ + 1. In other words, a random-walk forecast involves a speculator

saying that the exchange rate forecast for one period's time (in this case three months) will be the same as it

is today. Anyone without any knowledge of economics can make a random-walk forecast simply by opening

the daily newspaper!

210

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

Flexible-price monetary model 0.0806

Real-interest-di$erential model 0.0882

Sticky-price portfolio model 0.0870

Random walk model 0.0769

Note that the above results are based on the values of the exchange rate listed in Table 9.5. Te reported results

are in line with those of Meese and Rogo$ (1983a, 1983b) in showing that a simple random-walk model has

a superior forecasting power than any of the popular models of exchange rate determination. Such a result is

quite devastating for professional forecasters who use sophisticated econometric models because it suggests

that anyone by opening a newspaper can on average outperform a sophisticated exchange rate model designed

by groups of professional forecasters (which leaves us with the puzzle of explaining those forecasters’ high

salaries). In addition to the poor RMSEs, Table 9.5 shows that none of the models does very well at forecasting

the exchange rate at the three-month horizon. In fact, in the Meese and Rogo$ studies, it is shown that it is

- nly at the 12-months plus horizon that exchange rate models start (in some instances) to outperform the
random-walk model. Te abysmal performance of the theories requires some explanation, which is attempted
in the next section.

9.8 EXPLAINING THE POOR RESULTS OF EXCHANGE RATE MODELS

In addition to the Meese and Rogo$ studies and the Pilbeam study, other researchers comparing existing

exchange rate models with varying degrees of econometric technicality have shown that exchange rate

models perform poorly empirically. (See for example, Frankel (1984) who tests his synthesis equation for

the Deutschmark, yen, pound, French franc and Canadian dollar against the US dollar; Backus (1984) who

concentrates on the Canadian–US dollar rates; Leventakis (1987) who concentrates on the Deutschmark–

US dollar; and Hacche and Townend (1981) who fail in their attempt to model sterling’s e$ective exchange

rate.) Although some authors such as MacDonald and Taylor (1993) have managed to beat the randomwalk model using a relatively sophisticated dynamic speci!cation of the monetary model for forecasting the

Deutschmark–dollar parity, they only manage to do so by a very small margin and their results could be timespeci!c and a result of the application of very sophisticated techniques. Overall, the empirical studies reveal

that the failure of existing exchange rate models is quite general.

In their paper, Engel and West (2005) have changed the research agenda. They argue that, rather than

looking for economic fundamentals to explain exchange rate fundamentals, a more fruitful avenue for

research is to see if exchange rate changes can predict the future path of economic fundamentals. Since the

foreign exchange market is forward looking then exchange rate changes today are likely to be conveyers of

information about the future path of economic fundamentals. Speci!cally they argue (p. 487) that:

if the models are good approximations and expectations reflect information about future fundamentals,

the exchange rate changes will likely be useful in forecasting these fundamentals. So these models

212

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

suggest that exchange rates Granger-cause the fundamentals. Using quarterly bilateral dollar exchange

rates, 1974–2001, for the dollar versus the currencies of the six other Group of Seven countries, we !nd

some evidence of such causality, especially for nominal variables.

Te authors report results that provide quite strong support for the hypothesis that exchange rate changes

predict the path of economic fundamentals (in statistical jargon, Granger-cause), rather than economic

fundamentals predicting the path of the exchange rate. As such, their results suggest the exchange rate is best

viewed as an asset price in which the exchange rate moves in advance of changes in economic fundamentals

and thus better predicts the course of those fundamentals, such as relative interest rates, relative money

supplies and relative growth rates.

No doubt one could engage in a data-mining exercise looking at particular subperiods, a variety of bilateral

exchange rates using di$erent estimation techniques, and present evidence (by excluding results that do not

support your model!) favouring a given theory. However, it is surely better to recognize that there is no clearcut empirical support for any given theory. Indeed, Cheung et al. (2005) have shown that di$erent models

have di$erent degrees of success at forecasting exchange rates at di$ering time horizons, but that no consistent

pattern emerges. They conclude (p. 1171): 'the results do not point to any given model/speci!cation as being

very successful. On the other hand, some models seem to do well at certain horizons, for certain criteria. And

indeed, it may be that one model will do well for one exchange rate and not for another'. Tis failure to account

satisfactorily for exchange rate behaviour does not mean that the exchange rate models are necessarily wrong;

rather it probably reflects the enormous econometric problems of modelling exchange rate behaviour. In

fact, the exchange rate theories provide many reasons as to why exchange rates will be difficult to model

empirically. Among the more important are:

 - Exchange rates are determined not simply by the stance of monetary policy, but depend in a complex
and as yet little understood manner upon the monetary/!scal policy mix and the interactions of these
macroeconomic policies between countries.

 Te theoretical literature on exchange rate determination, since the advent of floating exchange

rates, has made it abundantly clear that the current exchange rate depends not only upon the present

fundamentals, but also upon the expected future course of those fundamentals. For this reason, new

information which alters perceptions about the future course of these fundamental factors will have

an impact upon the current exchange rate. It is extremely difficult to identify and model changes in

new information and how they are discounted into the current exchange rate.

 - Another related problem has become known in the literature as the 'Finance Minister Problem' or 'Peso
Problem'. Even if we have a correct model of exchange rate determination and an event relevant to the
exchange rate is widely expected to occur at some time in the future (the appointment of a new !nance
minister or increase in the money supply) this will a$etc the current exchange rate. However, if the
expected event does not materialize (the !nance minister is not appointed or the money supply is not
increased) then the movements in the exchange rate will appear unrelated to the supposed underlying
determinants. Te model itself would not be wrong but the empirical test would not verify it.

 - Another closely related problem was illustrated in Box 9.1. Te dynamic path of the exchange rate
will be completely di$erent depending upon whether a given shock or policy disturbance has been
anticipated or unanticipated. As we shall see in section 9.8, while some empirical progress has been
made in identifying anticipated and unanticipated exchange rate movements, it has so far not been
possible to integrate accurately such e$ects into an empirically testable exchange rate model.

213

International Finance

 - All modern asset-market models of exchange rate determination are in agreement that expectations
are crucial to the determination of the current exchange rate. However, both in theory and when
it comes to the empirical test of a theory, the econometrics require that we adopt some major
simpli!cations. In the !rst instance, most theories assume that expectations are homogeneous when
in the real world they are clearly heterogeneous, as taking the predictions for the future spot exchange
rate from professional forecasters will testify. Also, when it comes to empirical implementation it
becomes necessary to adopt further radical simpli!cations. Some models assume perfect foresight

	- n the part of foreign exchange market participants, so that expectations are fully consistent with the
underlying theoretical model, while other models assume that exchange rate expectations are static

	- r follow a regressive expectations scheme. It is unlikely that any of these expectation mechanisms
properly speci!es the formation of expectations in an uncertain world (see section 9.10). Until we are
able more realistically to model exchange rate expectations we shall remain unable to satisfactorily
model exchange rate behaviour.

 - Another problem that may be particularly acute is that it has not only been changes in the supply of
money that have been important in explaining the exchange rate, but also instability in the demandfor-money schedules. Teoretically such shi,s are as important in determining the exchange rate as
changes in the money stock. In an attempt to study the problem of shi,s in money demand, Frankel
(1984) found that taking account of such shi,s could improve the performance of the monetary
model.

 - A particularly acute problem in attempts to model exchange rate behaviour since the advent of
floating rates is to incorporate into the empirical model the role of real shocks on exchange rate

movements.

 - A !nal problem worth mentioning and probably of considerable importance has been the enormous
changes in the !nancial and real structure of economies. Tese have had important implications for
the performance of economies and thereby on the exchange rate.

Tis list of reasons as to why it may prove empirically difficult to verify existing exchange rate models is rather

formidable. Te implication is that a given theory may be correct, but it may not pass an empirical test.

9.9 THE 'NEWS' APPROACH TO MODELLING EXCHANGE RATES

Although models of exchange rate determination measured in terms of levels have not proved particularly

successful, some success has been achieved with modelling exchange rate behaviour in a 'news' context. An

attractive feature of the news approach is that it combines the concept of exchange market efficiency with

modern models of exchange rate determination, and for this reason it is worth considering the approach in

some detail.

Authors such as Dornbusch (1980) and Frenkel (1982) have suggested that the correct way to model

_ex_

exchange rate movements is to presume that the foreign exchange market is efficient, in the sense that all

_ante_ pro!t opportunities are eliminated. Tis being the case, movements in exchange rates will be due to the

arrival of new information. As we shall see, the way that the two authors model news is somewhat di$erent,

but their results do provide some support for the news approach.

Te basic tenet of the news approach is that if the foreign exchange market is efficient then any di$erence

between the forward rate and the corresponding rate that later transpires must in an efficient market (with

214

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

no risk premium) be due to the arrival of new information. In other words, unanticipated exchange rate

movements are due to unexpected changes in the fundamentals. A typical speci!cation of a news model of

exchange rates is the following:

_st_                           - _ft t_ /                           - 1                           - _a_ 1                           - _a uX_ 2 _t_                           - _a uY_ 3 _t_                           - _a uZ_ 4 _t_                           - _ut_ (9.14)

where _s_ t is the log of the spot exchange rate at time _t_ ; _f_ t/t–1 is the log of the forward exchange rate for time _t_ at

time _t_ - 1; and _uX_ t, _uY_ t and _uZ_ t are the logs of unexpected changes in the fundamental variables _X_, _Y_ and _Z_ .

Te main problem for the news-type models is obtaining a proxy for the unexpected change in the

fundamentals (the right-hand side of equation (9.14)). While the actual change in the selected fundamentals

is known, the problem is to devise proxies for what was the expected change. By deducting from the actual

change in a variable the proxy for the expected change in that variable, we are le, with the unexpected

change.

In devising a proxy for the unexpected change in the exchange rate we can invoke the EMH. In other words,

the expected spot rate is given by the forward exchange rate in the previous period. Hence, by deducting from

the actual exchange rate the previous period's forward rate we have a proxy for the unexpected change in the

exchange rate.

As for the unexpected change in the fundamentals, one has !rstly to decide what the fundamental variables

_X_ t, _Y_ t and _Z_ t are. Tis choice will obviously be dependent upon the exchange rate model selected. Having

selected the model it is then necessary to devise the proxies for the unexpected change in the variables chosen.

Tere are several alternative methods for devising such proxies:

1. Use publicly available forecasts – this is the approach taken by Dornbusch (1980), who takes the

six-monthly forecasts of the OECD as broadly representative of informed opinion about expected

economic growth rates and current account balances. By deducting these forecasts from what

subsequently occurred, he obtains a proxy for the unexpected change in these variables.

2. Use regression analysis. We can take a fundamental variable _X_, make it a dependent variable and

produce a forecast of what _X_ will be in the next period on the basis of the expected values of its

supposed determinants. Tat is:

_Xt t_ /                    - 1                    - _a_ 1                    - _a L_ 2 _t t_ /                    - 1                    - _a M_ 3 _t t_ /                    - 1                    - _a N_ 4 _t t_ /                    - 1                    - …� _ut_

where _X_ t/t–1 is the forecast value for the fundamental variable _X_ t at time _t_    - 1, and _L_ t/t–1, _M_ t/t–1 and

_N_ t/t–1 are the expected values for the fundamental variables _L_, _M_ and _N_ for time _t_ at time _t_   - 1 that

are supposed to be useful for predicting variable _X_    - ne period ahead. Te above regression would

then yield a forecast (expected) value for _X_ t that could be deducted from the actual value to yield

the unexpected change. Tis method is not very popular because it depends on having a good

explanatory model for the variable _X_ . Tis is very rarely the case in economics.

3. Use a time series methodology known as autoregression. With this method the forecast value of

fundamental variable _X_ is determined purely by a regression of past values of _X_ . Tat is:

_X_ = _a_ + _a_ _X_ + _a_ _X_ + _a_ _X_ + … + _ut_

t/t–1 1 2 t–1 3 t–2 4 t–3

where _X_ t–1, _X_ t–2 and _X_ t–3 etc are increasingly previous values of the variable _X_ .

215

International Finance

Tis method is a fairly popular way of generating a forecast for the value of _X_ as one is e$ectively

extrapolating from the current and past values of _X_ in order to generate an expected value of _X_ .

In the Dornbusch (1980) and Frenkel (1982) studies that pioneered the news approach, the results were

found to be highly supportive. Generally, the unexpected changes in the fundamentals (that is, the news

items) were found to be signi!cant determinants of the unexpected change in the exchange rate and the

coefficients of the expected sign. However, the choice of fundamental variables in the studies was rather ad

hoc, not involving tests of formal exchange rate models.

In a test of the news version of the real-interest-di$erential model, Edwards (1982) runs the following

regression:

_s_ t               - _a f_ 1 t t/               - 1               - _a um_ 2(               - _um_ *)t               - _a uy_ 3(               - _uy_ *)t               - _a ui_ 4(               - _ui_ *)t               - _ut_

where _f_ t/t–1 is the one-period-ahead forward exchange rate at time _t_ - 1, _um_ is the log of unexpected change in

domestic money supply, _uy_ is the unexpected increase in domestic income and _ui_ is the unexpected change

in the domestic real interest rate. An asterisk denotes the corresponding unexpected change in the foreign

variable.

Te expected signs in the coefficients are: _a_ 1 = 1 as the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future

spot rate (that is, EMH); _a_ 2 is positive so that a relative unexpected rise in the domestic money supply leads to

an unexpected depreciation; _a_ 3 should be negative as an unexpected rise in relative domestic income leads to

an unexpected appreciation; _a_ 4 should be negative as an unexpected rise in domestic real interest should lead

to an unexpected appreciation. Te results of the Edwards study are reported in Table 9.6.

Tese results provide mixed support for the news approach. As can be seen, the unexpected money supply

coefficient is correctly signed and signi!cant for two of the currencies, while the coefficient for expected

- output is signi!cant but of the wrong sign! However, the unexpected change in the real-interest di$erential is
not statistically signi!cant.

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

Apart from the original Dornbusch and Frenkel studies, MacDonald (1983) tested a news-type model for six

currencies against the US dollar over the period 1972:Q1 to 1979:Q4. He found that monetary developments

are sometimes statistically important but occasionally with the wrong sign!

An interesting !nding by both Edwards (1983a, 1983b) and MacDonald (1983) is that in some regressions

past news (that is, lagged news terms) can have a signi!cant e$ect on the unexpected exchange rate change.

Such an e$etc is incompatible with the concept of exchange market efficiency. Edwards argues that this e$ect

may be due to a lag in the publication of data. MacDonald also !nds that lagged news terms can be statistically

signi!cant, even with a lag of up to four periods. Tis is something of a mystery because, while publication lags

may account for signi!cant one-period lags, it is difficult to rationalize two or three-period lags. In summary,

although some of the news items move exchange rates in the direction predicted, the results are not particularly

robust across di$erent currencies and the news items are sometimes statistically signi!cant but wrongly signed.

Furthermore, the fact that lagged news items can be signi!cant for more than one period does not tie in with

the concept of exchange market efficiency, although results using lagged news e$ects are not particularly robust.

In a detailed study, Ehrmann and Fratzcher (2005) examine the impact of news using daily data for the

dollar–Deutschmark (euro) for the period January 1993 to February 2003. They subtract the median money

market survey views of the likely announcement for a set of 25 macro variables (such as GDP growth, money

supply growth, inflation, unemployment, trade balance, retail sales and so on) from the actual announced

values to !nd the news element and !nd that they can successfully explain 73% of the direction of exchange

rate movements. In their study, they !nd that it is important to use real-time data when examining the impact

- f news, that is, data actually released at the time rather than vintage data – revised data is o,en released
months a,er the original data typically used in exchange rate studies. When they use vintage data they can

- nly successfully predict 60% of the direction of exchange rate movements. They also !nd that the impact of
news varies with market conditions; in particular, news has a greater impact in times when there is a high
degree of market uncertainty and when previous exchange rate volatility has been large. Teir study is not
entirely successful, however; while an unexpected tightening of US monetary policy, such as an unexpected
50 basis points rise in the Federal funds interest rate, leads to a 0.8% appreciation of the dollar, an unexpected
interest rate hike by the Bundesbank or European Central Bank did not seem to have a similar e$etc on the
Deutschmark/euro. One !nal point from the study is that while they !nd that the news approach is good at
explaining the direction of exchange rate movements, it tends to explain only around 40% of the magnitude

- f exchange rate movements that have actually occurred. Te authors hypothesize that this might be due to an
- verreaction on the part of market participants to news announcements.

Overall, the news approach which combines the concept of exchange market efficiency with conventional

exchange rate models has proved a relatively fruitful area for exchange rate research. Nonetheless, given that

the empirical evidence on exchange market efficiency and conventional exchange rate models both have little

empirical support, it is not surprising that the news approach which combines the two concepts has somewhat

mixed empirical support.

9.10 THE LONGER-RUN PREDICTABILITY OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS

Given the failure of models to successfully predict exchange rate movements in the short run, there has been

more emphasis in subsequent research on trying to predict exchange rate movements over the longer run. An

interesting paper in this respect is that of Mark (1995). Te basic approach taken by Mark is to run regressions

- f the following equation:

_s_ t+k– _s_ t = +k + *k ( _z_ t– _s_ t) + _u_ t+k  where _k_, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 (9.15)

217

International Finance

where _s_ t+k is the _k_ - step-ahead exchange rate forecast; _s_ t is the spot exchange rate; and _z_ t is a fundamental variable

signi!cant for exchange rate determination, for example _z_ t = [( _m_ t– _m_ t*) – ( ( _y_ t– _y_ t*)]. From the monetary

model, it should be noted that Mark imposes the restriction that the income elasticity of money demand (()

is equal to unity and _u_ t+k is a random error.

If the fundamental equation is useful at predicting exchange rates, then we would expect to !nd *k > 0 and

signi!cant, and that it should increase with the time horizon _k_ ; whereas if *k = 0 then there is mean reversion in

the exchange rate, which is unrelated to economic fundamentals. Note that lagged fundamentals are being used

to predict the future exchange rate which arises from the error correction mechanism methodology employed.

Mark estimates equation (9.15) using quarterly data for the period 1973:Q2 to 1991:Q4 for the Canadian dollar,

the Deutschmark, yen and Swiss franc against the dollar using 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 quarters ahead.

As shown in Table 9.7, the point estimates of *k are all positive and increase with time _k_ as does the

explanatory power of the regression reflected in the R [2] statistic. Except in the case of the Canadian dollar the

signi!cance of the estimates of *k improves with time. One negative result from the Mark study, however, is

that the estimated *k coefficients are not statistically di$erent from zero, although Mark argues that this may

be due mainly to the small sample size available. More positively, in a forecasting exercise Mark !nds that he

is able to beat a random-walk forecast using the Deutschmark, yen and Swiss franc at the four-year horizon

using the monetary model, though in the case of the Canadian dollar the random-walk model still wins

- ut. Overall, Mark's results seem to suggest that economic fundamentals and the monetary model contain
signi!cant information for the determination of the long-run exchange rate.

In a follow-up study, Mark and Sul (2001) using quarterly data for a panel of 19 countries for the period

1973:Q1 to 1997:Q1 !nd further support for the monetary model in the long run and suggest that it is better

than the use of PPP as a modelling device for the long-run exchange rate. They show that in an out-of-sample

forecasting exercise for 13 out of 18 currencies, the monetary model can (very marginally) improve forecasts

- f exchange rates at the one-period-ahead quarterly forecast horizon compared to a random-walk forecast. In

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

addition, the PPP model can also be shown very marginally to improve upon a random-walk forecast at the

quarterly investment horizon. At the 16-quarter investment horizon, the monetary model is able decisively to

beat the random walk for 17 of the 18 currencies, as does the PPP model. However, a word of caution is introduced

in the Mark and Sul study in that the beating of the random-walk forecast is valid when either the dollar or Swiss

franc are used as the _numeraire_ currency. If, instead, the Japanese yen is used as the _numeraire_ currency, the

random walk beats the monetary model at the quarterly investment horizon and, more importantly, even beats

both the monetary and PPP models, even at the 16-quarter horizon! Another note of caution is that Faust et al.

(2003) show that if one uses original released data (that is, data available at the time forecasts are made) rather

than fully revised data (which were not available to market participants at the time), their results undermine to

some extent Mark's (1995) study especially for the yen and Deutschmark parities against the dollar. They also

show that exchange rate forecasts are generally much better using real-time data than fully revised _ex post_ data

as has been done in virtually all exchange rate studies including the classic Meese and Rogo$ studies.

Further support for the monetary model as a long-run description of the data is provided by Groen (2000),

who tests the following exchange rate model using both cross-sectional data and pooled panel-data methods

(a mixture of time series and cross-sectional data) for a group of 14 countries for the period 1973:Q1 to

1994:Q4. Using either the dollar or the Deutschmark as the numeraire currency provides long-run support

for the monetary model. Using cross-sectional data, Groen estimates if the average exchange rate change 3 _st_ is

related to the average di$erential money ( ~~3~~ ~~_m_~~ _t_ ) supply growth rate and the average di$erential change in real

income (3 _yt_ ) as given by:

3 _st_ =* + *1( ~~3~~ ~~_m_~~ _t_ ~~)~~ + *2( ~~3~~ ~~_y_~~ _t_ ~~)~~ + _u_ t (9.16)

where the expected sign for the coefficients is *1 = 1 and *2 < 0.

Te results reported by Groen are quite favourable to the monetary model as a long-run description of the

data with the following two regressions as reported in Table 9.8.

As can be seen, the cross-sectional estimates show that as an average long-run description of the data for

the 14 currencies the monetary model seems to perform very well; the estimated *1 coefficient is signi!cant

and one cannot reject the hypothesis that it is equal to unity as predicted by the monetary model. Furthermore,

the income elasticity of money demand is negative and signi!cant as predicted by the model (although more

negative than the –1 predicted in many monetary models). In addition, using a more sophisticated pooled

panel data methodology, Groen obtains estimates of *1 = 0.664, *2 = –1.335 for the dollar and *1 = 0.923,

*2 = –1.832 for the Deutschmark. All this shows that the monetary model seems to have quite good long-run

predictive powers for explaining exchange rate movements.

In an interesting paper, Rapach and Wohar (2002) take a di$erent approach to Mark (1995) and test the

monetary model for 14 currencies against the US dollar. Tey test the validity of the monetary model using

very-long-run annual data covering the period 1880–1995 (in most cases). Teir results show considerable

support for the monetary model for France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, moderate support for Belgium,

Finland and Portugal, and only weak support for Switzerland. However, they fail to !nd support for Australia,

Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK. One problem with using relatively long periods of data is

that the test covers many di$erent exchange rate regimes, including the gold standard, the Bretton Woods

system and the period of floating. A key test in the paper is as follows:

St= * + *1( _m_ t– _m_ t*) + *2( _y_ t– _y_ t*) + _u_ t (9.17)

According to the monetary model then we would expect *1 = 1 and *2 = –1. A summary of the results for some

- f the currencies is shown in Table 9.9.

Other studies such as Kilian (1999) and Kilian and Taylor (2003) based on long-run regressions produce

more mixed results, though the latter study using a simple PPP-based model of fundamentals, that is, setting

_z_ t = _s_ t = ( _p_ t– _p_ t*) as in the Mark (1995) study and allowing for non-linearity in the data-generating process,

!nds strong evidence in favour of longer-term predictability of the nominal exchange rate, suggesting that

PPP is a valid long-run proposition. Kilian and Taylor (2003) argue that one reason for the failure of existing

exchange rate models is that they are based on linear relationships between macro-determinants and exchange

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

rates. Tis means that they may be missing important non-linear relationships between exchange rates and

macro-fundamentals. In particular, the long-run fundamentals are represented by PPP, and Kilian and Taylor

allow for a non-linear adjustment mechanism of exchange rate deviations from PPP to their PPP values. They

look at seven bilateral dollar parities using quarterly data, and while their forecasts fail to beat the random

walk in the short run they !nd that for six of the seven parities they are able to beat a random-walk forecast

at a time horizon of two to three years. However, they are unable to beat the random-walk model in periods

- f six months or less, suggesting that the Meese and Rogo$ (1983a, 1983b) results remain robust at the shortterm horizon. Indeed, they are unable to decisively refute the Meese and Rogo$ results in an out-of-sample
test at even longer-term horizons, although this is due in part to the low power of the statistical tests, given the
amount of forecasts that they are able to make.

It now seems that there is an accumulation of quite sophisticated econometric evidence that suggests that

_long-run_ exchange rates can in large part be modelled on the basis of economic fundamentals such as the

monetary model of exchange rate determination. Te evidence is somewhat mixed and the success of the

monetary model in the long run cannot yet be categorized as a 'stylized fact'. However, it is becoming a stylized

fact that economic fundamentals are proving better for both modelling and forecasting the long-run exchange

rate than the short-run exchange rate.

9.11 MODELLING EXCHANGE RATE EXPECTATIONS

Given the importance of future expected exchange rates for the current exchange rate, any satisfactory model

- f exchange rates must model exchange rate expectations. Te problem is that modelling economic agents'
expectations is an area of considerable controversy in economics. Tere are a variety of alternative but plausible
methods of modelling expectations, and in this section we briefly look at some of the popular hypotheses used
and summarize some of the empirical research in this area.

Tere are six plausible theoretical methods for modelling the expected future exchange rate: static

expectations, adaptive expectations, extrapolative expectations, regressive expectations, rational expectations

and perfect foresight!

_Static expectations_

Es = s

t+1/t t

Te expected exchange rate in one period's time ( _Es_ t+1/t) is equal to the current exchange rate ( _s_ t). In other

words, the average expectation is that the exchange rate will not change. Such an expectation could be

rationalized by assuming that economic agents consider that there is an equal probability of the exchange rate

appreciating or depreciating by a given percentage. In other words, if the current exchange rate is $1.30/€1,

the exchange rate expected one year hence is also $1.30/€1.

_Adaptive expectations_

_Es_ t                - 1/t                -                - _s_ t                - (1�                - ) _Es_ t t/                - 1 0                -                -                - 1

Te expected exchange rate in one period's time is equal to a weighted average of the current exchange rate

and the exchange rate that was expected to be the current exchange rate one period before ( _Es_ t/t–1). Tus, if

the current exchange rate exceeds the previously anticipated current exchange rate then agents will revise

221

International Finance

upwards their forecasts as compared to previous periods' forecasts. For instance, if the current dollar–euro

rate is $1.30/€1, but one year previously agents had thought it would be $1.20/€1, their forecast for the euro in

- ne year's time will be above $1.20/€1 but below $1.30/€1. How close it is to the current rate will depend on
the weight attached to the current exchange rate (the larger is +).

_Extrapolative expectations_

_Es_ t                  - 1/t                  - _s_ t                  - _m s_ ( t                  - _s_ t                  - 1) _m_                  - 0

Te expected exchange rate in one period's time is equal to the current exchange rate plus some multiple ( _m_ )

- f the change in the exchange rate during the preceding period. If the current exchange rate is $1.30/€1 and
- ne year previously the euro stood at $1.20/€1 (that is, the euro appreciated by $0.10 over the previous year),
the expected exchange rate one year hence will be somewhere above $1.30/€1. If _m_ is less than one it will be
between $1.30/€1 and $1.40/€1, while if _m_ is greater than 1 it will be above $1.40/€1. In other words, if the
euro appreciated the previous year it is expected to appreciate in the forthcoming year.

_Regressive expectations_

_Es_ t                - 1/t                -                - _s_ t                - (1�                - ) *s 0                -                -                - 1

Te expected exchange rate in one period's time is a weighted function of the current exchange rate and

agents' estimate of the long-run equilibrium exchange rate (s*). If the current exchange rate is di$erent to

the long-run equilibrium exchange rate, the expected exchange rate in the next period will lie closer to the

equilibrium rate than the current exchange rate. For example, if the current exchange rate is $1.30/€1 but

the underlying long-term equilibrium rate is believed to be $1.20/€1, then the expected exchange rate one

year hence will lie between $1.30/€1 and $1.20/€1. In other words, the exchange rate is expected to converge

towards its long-run equilibrium exchange rate.

_Rational expectations_

_Es_ t                     - 1/t                     - _s_ t                     - 1                     - _u_ t                     - 1

Te expected exchange rate in the next period will on average equal the actual exchange rate ( _s_ t+1), although

it may deviate by a random error of _u_ t+1; the average of _u_ t+1 being zero. On average the exchange rate that

is expected to materialize is the exchange rate that actually does materialize. Te rational expectations

hypothesis is that, on average, over a number of time periods, economic agents do not systematically over

- r underpredict the exchange rate. They may make forecast errors but these mistakes consist of sometimes
- verpredicting the future exchange rate and sometimes underpredicting it.

_Perfect foresight_

_Es_ t                      - 1/t                      - _s_ t                      - 1

Te expected exchange rate in the next period is equal to the actual exchange rate that materializes.

Tis suggests that economic agents have a complete knowledge of the model underlying exchange rate

determination so that they do not make any errors concerning the future exchange rate.

222

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

_Which expectations hypothesis is best?_

All of the above expectations mechanisms have some degree of plausibility; however, the static expectation,

adaptive expectation and extrapolative expectation mechanisms are somewhat arbitrary because they state

that the future exchange rate can be predicted entirely on the basis of current and past values of the exchange

rate. As such, no attention is paid to other information that may be relevant to the future exchange rate, such

as domestic and foreign inflation rates, interest rates, !scal and monetary policy stance, and so on.

Te regressive expectations mechanism, rational expectations and perfect foresight models are from a

theoretical viewpoint much better suited to dealing with exchange rates because they all allow for economic

agents using a far wider set of information. Te regressive expectations mechanism requires that economic

agents form a view concerning the appropriate long-run equilibrium exchange rate, while the rational

expectations hypothesis suggests that, although agents do not always get the exact exchange rate right,

they nevertheless do not systematically get things wrong. Finally, the perfect foresight model implies that

economic agents actually have the correct model of exchange rate determination and thereby do not make

errors with regard to the future exchange rate. While this latter case may seem unrealistic, it does have

the major advantage that the exchange rate implications from models that employ perfect foresight are

purely due to the structure of the model itself and not because of an arbitrary speci!cation of exchange rate

expectations.

**Box 9.2 The scapegoat theory of exchange rates**

Bacchetta and Wincoop (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011) suggest a new scapegoat theory of exchange rate

determination that helps to explain the unstable relationship between economic fundamentals and the

exchange rate in the short to medium term. They argue that, while economic agents may have a good idea

concerning the long-run relationship between economic fundamentals, in the short to medium term

they are far less certain about the relationship. In the short to medium term, exchange rate movements

are driven by both changes in economic fundamentals and also by unobservable fundamental shocks.

In the short run, when the exchange rate moves in a manner contrary to what economic agents had

expected on the basis of their prior beliefs about the underlying structural relationships, economic

agents look for scapegoats that can account for the inconsistency. If the currency movement is driven by

some unobservable fundamental shock then it may be rational for agents to assign a greater weight to

  - ne or more of the fundamental variables, making it a scapegoat to explain the exchange rate movement.

According to Bacchetta and Wincoop a fundamental variable can become a scapegoat if the

shock to an unobservable economic fundamental is large, causing the exchange rate movement to

be unexplained and any particular observable fundamental variable to deviate substantially from its

equilibrium value. According to the scapegoat theory, when an exchange rate movement is driven by a

change in unobservables (such as large customer order flows) then it is rational (or 'rational confusion')

for agents to blame the movement on observable macroeconomic fundamentals that are deviating from

their long-run equilibrium values. If the theory holds, then it may help to explain the large degree of

instability in the short to medium term in the relationship between macroeconomic fundamentals and

exchange rate movements.

In an empirical test Fratzcher et al. (2015) !nd strong empirical support for the scapegoat theory. To

conduct their test the authors use monthly survey data for the period 2001–09 from 40 to 60 !nancial

market participants who were asked to rate on a quantitative scale of one to ten the importance of six

key variables (short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, economic growth, inflation, current

account and equity flows) as drivers of currency movements. As a proxy for unobservable changes in

economic fundamentals the authors use proprietary customer order flow data from one of the major

market participants, UBS bank. For advanced currencies the sum of order flows from hedge funds

and asset managers is taken as a proxy for unobservable fundamentals – the idea being that these are

sophisticated investors and that their demands for a currency reflect other determinants of exchange rate

movements. Teir empirical studies cover 12 currencies versus either the US dollar or the euro. To see if

the scapegoat theory works (SCA) they compare the performance of the scapegoat model against a basic

macromodel with constant parameters (CP) and against a second model that allows for time varying

parameters (TVP). As shown in Table 9.10 the addition of the scapegoat model considerably improves

the adjusted R [2] parameter compared to not using the scapegoat model for the major industrialized

currencies, with similar results holding for emerging market currencies:

As can be seen in Table 9.10, the time varying model scapegoat models outperform the constant

parameter model and its explanatory power is signi!cantly increased once one includes an allowance for the

scapegoat e$ect. In their paper, Fratzcher et al. (2015, p. 19) conclude that ‘the scapegoat model, especially

in its time-varying formulation, does very well in explaining exchange rate movements, outperforming

benchmark macro and order flow models that do not allow for scapegoat e$ects'. While there will need

to be further empirical tests to check the robustness of the scapegoat model, the results suggest that the

linkage between economic fundamentals and exchange rate movements in the short run may be somewhat

stronger than the earlier literature had concluded, once scapegoat e$ects are incorporated.

9.12 EMPIRICAL TESTS OF DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS MECHANISMS

Tere are great difficulties in modelling exchange rate expectations; in particular market expectations

concerning the expected future spot rate are not directly observable, and if one uses the forward rate as a

proxy then this constitutes a joint test of the rational expectations hypothesis and the non-existence of a risk

premium. Fortunately, sets of survey data concerning market participants' forecasts for the future exchange

rate do exist; such data sets are made up of forecasts from various market participants such as economists,

bankers, corporate treasurers, forecasting agencies, central bankers, investment managers and the like.

224

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

Dominguez (1986), using Money Market Services data for the period 1983–85, rejects the REH for

modelling one-week, one-month and three-month expectations for all currencies studied. Frankel and Froot

(1987) use survey data to examine extrapolative, adaptive and regressive expectations mechanisms and !nd a

di$erence between short-run and long-run expectations. In particular, they !nd evidence that, for short-term

horizons of one week to one month, expectations tend to be extrapolative. However, in the longer run of 6 to

12 months they !nd expectations tend to be regressive with the exchange rate moving towards its long-run

value as proxied by PPP. They argue that this may reflect the fact that market participants use chartist and

technical analysis in the short run, whereas economic fundamentals are more widely used for longer-run

forecasting. However, Liu and Maddala (1992), using the cointegration technique, !nd that the REH cannot

be rejected at the one-week-ahead forecasting horizon, although they reject it at the one-month-plus time

horizon. Meanwhile, Allen and Taylor (1990) are unable to reject the null hypothesis of static expectations

for very-short-term forecasts. Finally, Cavaglia et al. (1994) reject the hypothesis of rational expectations and

indeed !nd some evidence that expectations are irrational.

In summary, the empirical evidence concerning which expectations mechanisms are best for modelling

exchange rate expectations is very mixed. Te most plausible story is that the appropriate expectations

mechanism is itself time-variant, with market participants sometimes having static expectations, sometimes

extrapolative expectations, sometimes regressive expectations, and so on. Te rational expectations

mechanism, while theoretically highly plausible, seems to be far from the complete story. Furthermore, it

must also be recognized that the studies tend to take the median forecast of various market participants'

forecasts for the purpose of empirical testing of the various expectation hypotheses; however, authors such

as MacDonald and Marsh (1996) have shown that there is usually a high degree of heterogeneity in market

participants' forecasts, suggesting that economic agents process information di$erently and that any individual

expectations hypothesis is unlikely to capture the actual diversity present in the marketplace.

9.13 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO MODELLING EXCHANGE RATES: THE ROLE OF

CHARTISTS AND FUNDAMENTALISTS

Partly due to the failure of existing exchange rate models to account satisfactorily for exchange rate behaviour,

a number of papers, such as Goodhart (1988), Allen and Taylor (1989), Frankel and Froot (1990), De Grauwe

and Vansanten (1990) and Pilbeam (1995), have started to analyse the role played by various groups in the

foreign exchange market. Two groups that have attracted an increasing amount of attention are the so-called

'chartists' and 'fundamentalists'.

Chartists claim to be able to predict successfully the future behaviour of a variable such as the exchange

rate merely by examining a variety of recent charts of the exchange rate. Chartists claim that certain patterns

- f behaviour repeat themselves and that, by detecting the relevant pattern in play, considerable success
can be had in predicting the future exchange rate. Many of the patterns are given names such as 'head and
shoulders', 'triple bottom', 'ascending triangle' and 'double top'; Feeny (1989) provides an excellent summary of
chartist methodology. Te important point about chartists is that the only information they require to predict
exchange rates is the recent past behaviour of the exchange rate itself; 'economic fundamentals', such as money
supplies, interest rates or the balance of payments position, are not required. Critics of chartists are inclined to
accuse them of 'having long rulers and small brains'.

Fundamentalists are economists who argue that the best way to predict the future course of exchange rates

is to look at the prospectives for underlying economic fundamentals such as future interest rates, balance

- f payments prospects, inflation rates and so forth. Te important thing about fundamentalists is that they

225

International Finance

believe that the foreign exchange market is efficient, so past behaviour of the exchange rate will be of little use

in predicting its course. What matters for the exchange rate is the prospective development of the economic

fundamentals.

Frankel and Froot (1990) argue that much exchange rate behaviour may be explained by the fact that at certain

times chartists have the upper hand in determining the exchange rate, while at other times the fundamentalists

have the upper hand. In periods of high uncertainty over the course of economic fundamentals, chartists tend

to be the predominant force in the exchange market; while at times when economic fundamentals strongly

point to a certain path for the exchange rate, the fundamentalists become the predominant force.

Tere are a wide range of views within both chartism and fundamentalism. Allen and Taylor (1989)

conducted a survey of the influence of chartism on the London Foreign Exchange Market and found that

chartism is widely used as an input for short-term forecasting, while fundamental analysis is mainly used for

longer-term forecasting. On each Tuesday during the period June 1988 to March 1989 they asked a sample

- f chartists for their exchange rate forecasts for the sterling–dollar, dollar–mark and dollar–yen for both one
week and one month ahead. It was noted that there was a tendency for chartists to underpredict a rise in the
exchange rate and overpredict in a falling market. Tis suggests that chartists' 'elasticity of expectations' is less
than unity – that is, a 1% rise (fall) in the exchange rate appears to induce a less than 1% expected rise (fall)
in the following period. However, one chartist codenamed 'Mr M' did manage consistently to outperform the
random-walk model. Allen and Taylor found that there were signi!cant di$erences in the forecasts between
individual chartists, and chartist forecasts were generally worse than a random-walk forecast. It seems that
chartists are just as bad as economists in forecasting exchange rates.

Given the variety of chartist and fundamental methods that could be used to forecast the exchange rate,

an obvious question arises as to which method is most pro!table. In a study of this issue, Pilbeam (1995),

using quarterly data from January 1973 to the end of 1994, conducted a study of the relative investment

performance of three groups of hypothetical traders: chartists, fundamentalists and simpletons. Te chartist

group was made up of three traders that come up with di$erent forecasts merely by using past movements of

the exchange rate to forecast the future exchange rate. Similarly, the fundamentalist group was made up of three

traders that use di$erent exchange rate models for forecasting the future exchange rate, namely the flexibleprice monetary model, the Frankel sticky-price monetary model and the portfolio balance model. Finally, a

group of three simpleton traders was introduced that merely uses simple trading rules when investing their

funds. For example, a 'foreign simpleton' places all his money into the foreign currency and leaves it there

to earn the foreign interest rate plus (less) any appreciation (depreciation) of the foreign currency; a 'highest

simpleton' places his funds into the currency that provided the highest return (interest rate and exchange

rate return) in the previous quarter; while, !nally, a 'random-walk simpleton' who believes the exchange rate

follows a random walk merely places his funds in the currency with the highest international interest rate

since he expects no gain to be made on average from exchange rate movements. Te key results from the

Pilbeam study are shown in Table 9.11, which comprises the respective group yields and standard deviations

derived by taking the average of the three traders associated with each group for the period 1974–94.

Te study shows that there is no clear-cut winner in terms of pro!tability and that one could not reject

the hypothesis that the annualized yields achieved by chartists, fundamentalists and simpletons were equal for

any of the individual parities or for the group currency averages. While there were statistical di$erences in the

variability of yields between the various groups, no robust pattern emerged. For instance, for the pound parity

the fundamentalists had a statistically signi!cant lower variability than the simpletons, while the reverse held for

the yen parity. Te clear result that emerges from the Pilbeam study is that at the quarterly investment horizon

there is no real di$erence between trading using past movements of the exchange rate or using economic

fundamentals; indeed, even naïve trading strategies seem to perform as well as trading on charts or fundamentals.

9.14 CONCLUSIONS

In contrast to the exciting advances in the theoretical modelling of exchange rates, empirical tests of these

theories have been notoriously unrewarding, especially at the short-term horizon. None of the major theories

stand up well to empirical examination. In large part, the empirical failure of the models reflects the enormous

econometric problems involved in modelling exchange rates. However, the use of more sophisticated

econometric techniques, while not greatly improving short-term modelling, has begun to suggest that there

are predictable long-run relationships between exchange rate movements and economic fundamentals.

Tere is quite a substantial amount of empirical evidence that rejects the joint test of exchange market

efficiency and no risk premium; that is, UIP in the short run. Tis is particularly damaging for the monetarist

models which assume both. Although the portfolio balance model allows for departures from UIP due to the

existence of a risk premium, there is little empirical evidence to support it as an alternative to the monetary

models. Attempts to explain the risk premium in terms of its theoretical underlying determinants have failed.

In summary, the possibility that the modern theories of exchange rate determination are very incomplete

explanations of shortto medium-term exchange rate movements cannot be ruled out. However, subsequent

work has suggested that some of the econometric rejections of UIP do not necessarily imply the ability to

make excess pro!ts over the medium to long term, suggesting that the foreign exchange market may still be

efficient.

On the other hand, empirical rejection of the models does not necessarily mean that they are wrong because

tests of exchange rate models do little justice to the complexities of the various theories. Tus, policy-makers

should not ignore the theories, though it may be unwise to base policy on any single theory. In this respect,

most theories emphasize the importance of pursuing stable monetary policies in order to avoid disruptive

exchange rate movements.

In all probability many of the major empirical issues concerning exchange rate determination in the

short to medium run are likely to remain unresolved in the foreseeable future, although some studies have

suggested better success in modelling long-run exchange rate behaviour. Research focusing on the role played

by di$erent groups such as chartists and fundamentalists in the determination of the exchange rate is yielding

new and useful insights. However, this approach is most unlikely to yield a signi!cant improvement in the

227

International Finance

empirical modelling of shortand medium-term exchange rate behaviour. Te core of the problem lies in

the fact that all sides accept that expectations are crucial to the modelling of the exchange rate, but as we

have seen we currently have no satisfactory method of measuring these expectations. Until we can more

satisfactorily model expectations we shall be unable to satisfactorily model shortto medium-run exchange

rate behaviour.
