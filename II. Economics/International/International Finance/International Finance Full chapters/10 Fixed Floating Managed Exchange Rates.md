10.1 INTRODUCTION

Prior to the move to generalized floating in 1973, the adoption of floating exchange rates had long been

advocated by eminent economists such as Milton Friedman (1953), Egon Sohmen (1961) and Harry Johnson

(1969). However, the experience with floating rates has not been the panacea that many advocates had

presupposed, and this has led many economists to propose schemes designed to limit exchange rate flexibility.

In this chapter, we will examine the traditional and more recent arguments for and against !xed and floating

exchange rates. We start by looking at the traditional debate over the two regimes, based upon evaluating

the arguments for and against each of the regimes. As we shall see, the traditional debate is inconclusive,

with floating rates having some advantages and disadvantages as compared to !xed exchange rates. Te

failure of the traditional debate stimulated an alternative method of evaluating these regimes based upon

comparing which regime best stabilizes the economy in the face of various shocks within the context of a

formal macroeconomic model. To give a flavour of the insights gained by this more modern approach we use

a simple macroeconomic model to evaluate the two regimes.

Although exchange rates have been allowed to float since 1973, authorities have frequently intervened in

the foreign exchange market in a bid to influence the exchange rate at which their currency is traded, hence

the term 'managed' floating. We will look at the economic rationale behind discretionary intervention in the

foreign exchange market. Te chapter also includes Box 10.1 which takes a brief look at an important strand

- f international economic literature known as optimal currency area theory, which attempts to !nd a set of
criteria for determining the optimal size of area for a single currency. Tis is a particularly important issue as
19 European countries have given up their national currencies for a single currency, the euro, and questions
arise as to how many countries the eurozone should encompass and what set of criteria economics can o$er
as to whether a country should be admitted to the currency.

**Box 10.1 The optimum currency area literature**

Aside from the issue of !xed, floating and managed exchange rates, there is a branch of economic

literature that focuses on the issue of the relevant economic criteria for determining the optimum

economic area for a single currency unit. Put simply, an optimum currency area is a region for which it

is optimal to have a common currency and a common monetary policy. For example, the United States is

a vast economic area; is it optimal for it to have only a single currency unit for that area or would it make

more economic sense for it to have two currencies, one for the western part and one for the eastern part?

Te issue is particularly pertinent when it comes to the European Union that has moved from a situation

where 19 of its member countries with 19 di$erent currencies have formed the eurozone area which

has one currency, the euro, to serve those 19 countries. What is the optimum number of countries that

should join the euro and what criteria should be used to evaluate the suitability of a prospective member

for joining the euro? Indeed, is a single currency optimal only for one country, a group of countries or

all countries of the world? Determining a set of criteria to determine which countries should participate

in a monetary union has been the subject matter of optimal currency area theory. In the literature on

the subject there is no single set of criteria which is generally agreed upon, and for excellent surveys the

reader is referred to Tavlas (1993) and Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1994). Nonetheless, it is worthwhile

to review briefly some of the criteria that have been suggested for determining which countries should

join a monetary union:

   - **Degree of factor mobility internationally.** Mundell (1961) proposed that the higher the degree
	 - f factor mobility between countries, then the more bene!cial a monetary union would be
between them. Te rationale behind this criterion is that if a country is in a monetary union
and faces a fall in demand for its goods, which pushes its balance of payments into de!cit, high
capital mobility will enable it to !nance its de!cit more easily without the need for an exchange
rate depreciation. In addition, high labour mobility will mean that de!cit regions can deflate
their economies without fear of a large increase in unemployment since labour can migrate to

	 - ther countries within the union. Conversely, if factor mobility is low, then an exchange rate
depreciation is required to eliminate the de!cit and maintain employment levels, and hence a
monetary union would be undesirable.

   - **Degree of $nancial integration.** Tis is connected with the degree of factor mobility
mentioned above, but is speci!cally concerned with the ability of a country to gain access to
external !nance. If a country has a high degree of !nancial integration with other countries,
then it will be more able to !nance its de!cits and be less dependent on exchange rate
changes. A small variation in its interest rates will attract the necessary capital flows to !nance
imbalances. If countries are !nancially integrated then a single currency is a more feasible

	 - ption than in the absence of such integration.
   - **Degree of openness.** McKinnon (1963) has argued that the more open the economy, as
measured by the size of its tradables relative to its non-tradables sector, the more pro!table it
is to join a currency union. Te rationale is that if the economy has a large tradables sector it
will be much more vulnerable to inflation from a depreciating currency and unemployment
from an appreciating currency and therefore the less desirable the exchange rate changes will
be. Indeed, the more important that trade is for the country, the more potential it will have to

230

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

bene!t from the introduction of a single currency with its major trading partners. Also, the

more open the economy is, the higher are the adjustment costs associated with changes in the

exchange rate.

   - **Degree of product diversi$cation.** Kenen (1969) has suggested that the more diversi!ed
a country's range of exports and imports, the more it will bene!t from monetary union. A
diversi!ed economy means less variability in its export earnings and import expenditure and
more stability for its balance of payments. Accordingly, there will be less need to resort to
exchange rate changes. If, however, it has only a few export products it may experience much
greater variability in its export earnings and will be more dependent upon exchange rate
changes to maintain external equilibrium.

   - **Degree of similarity of inflation rates.** Te idea underlying this criterion is fairly
straightforward. If countries have similar inflation rates then PPP theory suggests that there is
no need for exchange rate changes and hence a monetary union is more feasible, whereas if the
countries have widely divergent propensities to inflate, then floating exchange rates become
necessary to ensure that the relatively high inflation countries maintain their international
competitiveness.

Even if we ignore numerous criticisms that can be made of the individual criteria – see the surveys by

Tower and Willett (1976), Ishiyama (1975) and Goodhart (1975, ch. 15) – it is clear that emphasizing

  - ne particular factor is hardly sufficient grounds for justifying monetary union. What happens if two
countries score well under one of the criteria and poorly on all the others? An index of the various
criteria might o$er a better solution, but there is plenty of scope for disagreement over the appropriate
weight to assign to each of the criteria and then the total index value that would justify membership

  - f a monetary union. Goodhart (1975) emphasized that the need for a high degree of social cohesion
appears to be a crucial determinant of the size of a single currency area in the real world rather than any
clear-cut economic criteria. In summary, the optimal currency area literature addresses an interesting
question but the various criteria that have been suggested are far from conclusive.

**10.2 THE CASE FOR FIXED EXCHANGE RATES**

Te case for !xed exchange rates usually has two sides to it: on the one hand there are some positive arguments

in its favour of !xed exchange rates; and on the other hand there are arguments against floating exchange

rates. One needs to be careful with this approach because arguments against floating exchange rates are not

necessarily arguments in favour of !xed rates: they may well constitute arguments for some degree of exchange

rate management rather than for !xed parities. In this spirit, let us consider both the positive arguments in

favour of !xed rates and the argument against floating rates.

_Fixed exchange rates promote international trade and investment_

Te proponents of !xed exchange rates argue that !xed parities provide the best environment for the conduct

- f international trade and investment. It is argued that, just as a single currency is the best means of promoting
economic activity at the national level, !xed exchange rates are the best means of promoting international

231

International Finance

trade and investment at the international level. Exchange rate fluctuations cause additional uncertainty and

risk in international economic transactions and inhibit the growth and development of such transactions.

_Fixed exchange rates provide discipline for macroeconomic policies_

An argument frequently put forward in favour of !xed exchange rates is that the commitment to a !xed

exchange rate regime provides a degree of discipline to domestic macroeconomic policy that is absent

if exchange rates are allowed to float. If the authorities are in a !xed rate regime, the pursuit of reckless

macroeconomic policies (such as excessive monetary growth) will lead to pressure for a devaluation of the

currency necessitating intervention by the authorities to defend their currency and a fall in their reserves. If

the pressures continue, the authorities would eventually have to devalue the currency which would be taken

as a sign by economic agents that the authorities have mismanaged the economy. Such an unpleasant scenario

should encourage governments to resist adopting unsound expansionary macroeconomic policies which

they are invariably tempted to undertake prior to elections and in their attempts to reconcile conflicting

demands.

_Fixed exchange rates promote international cooperation_

Another argument in favour of !xed exchange rates is that they necessitate a degree of international cooperation

and coordination between countries that is generally absent under floating exchange rates (see Chapter 14

for more on international policy coordination). Countries that agree to peg their exchange rates generally

have to agree on measures to be undertaken when the agreed exchange rate parity comes under pressure.

At a minimum, !xed exchange rates require an agreement to avoid conflicting exchange rate targets, ruling

- ut the dangers of competitive devaluation scenarios such as occurred in the 1930s. Te enhanced degree
- f international cooperation should bring bene!ts and lead to a more stable environment for the conduct of
international trade and investment.

_Speculation under floating rates is likely to be destabilizing_

Te major argument advanced against floating exchange rates is that they are likely to be characterized

by destabilizing private speculation, producing the 'wrong' exchange rate, that is, an exchange rate that is

suboptimal from the viewpoint of resource allocation. Tere are several ways in which private speculation can

bring about the wrong exchange rate. Some of the arguments depend on 'irrational' speculation, while others

depend upon uncertainty.

One example of irrational speculation frequently cited is that the foreign exchange market can be **too**

**risk-averse** . It o,en attaches too high a probability to the possibility of a depreciation of a 'weak' currency or,

equivalently, too high a probability to the possibility of an appreciation of a 'strong' currency, even when this is

not justi!ed by the fundamentals. Tat is, one currency, say the pound sterling, is regarded as 'too risky', while

another, say the US dollar, is regarded as 'safe' – market participants are basing their exchange rate forecasts

not only on currently available information but also on past performance. Te result is that there may be an

unjusti!ed reluctance to move out of dollars and to hold pounds, so that there is a larger depreciation of the

pound than is justi!ed by the fundamentals required as a premium by speculators to hold the pound. As a

result, the dollar becomes overvalued while the pound becomes undervalued. Te argument does not imply

that risk-aversion is an inefficient feature of the foreign exchange market, but rather that excessive risk-aversion

unjusti!ed by the fundamentals is. Instability of a country's economic policies may well create uncertainty and

232

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

therefore risk concerning estimates about the correct value of its currency. Excessive risk-aversion, however,

implies that part of the risk premium required by the market is unjusti!ed by the fundamentals.

Another case where irrational private speculation can produce the wrong rate is via the **'bandwagon'**

**effect** . Te idea is that there is too much self-generating speculation that is detached from the fundamentals:

'speculation feeding upon speculation' rather than the fundamentals. A possible scenario involving the

bandwagon e$ect is when some news hits the market, say an unexpected increase in the UK money supply,

which then sets o$ unjusti!ed speculation that the eventual rate of monetary growth will be even greater,

bringing with it an unduly pessimistic inflation forecast. Assuming that the rate of growth of the money

supply contained in the news turns out to be the actual rate, the depreciation of the pound will turn out to

have been greater than was justi!ed by the news and this will then reverse itself when it becomes evident that

a bandwagon e$etc has been in play.

Te excessive risk-aversion and bandwagon e$etc arguments presuppose that foreign exchange speculators

do not use all the information and news available to them efficiently, and consequently speculation produces

the wrong exchange rate until eventually fundamentals reassert themselves. Authors such as Dornbusch

(1983) have emphasized reasons as to why even rational speculators can produce the 'wrong' exchange rate.

Tese explanations are all based upon the concept of exchange rate uncertainty.

One reason why rational speculators may produce the wrong exchange rate is that in a world of

uncertainty they do not know the correct exchange rate model, and as such they use a **seriously defective**

**model** . Teir expectations based on the wrong (irrelevant) exchange rate model will then generally

lead to the wrong exchange rate. Tis point is important because market participants may be impressed

by a plausible but relatively unimportant fundamental variable and make their expectations based

upon movements in that variable come true. Furthermore, changes in irrelevant variables may lead to

signi!cant exchange rate movements. A further danger is that economic agents may shi, their attention

between many irrelevant pieces of information, causing excessive exchange rate variability and even major

exchange rate collapses.

Another reason why rational speculators may produce the wrong exchange rate is known as the **Peso**

**problem** . Exchange rates are determined not only by what is held to be the underlying fundamentals today,

but by what is expected to happen to those fundamentals in the future. Even if the speculators' model of the

underlying fundamentals is correct, their perceptions about the future can prove to be seriously wrong. In

such cases, the exchange rate moves immediately in anticipation of events that do not materialize. Such _ex_

_post_ unjusti!ed exchange rate movements can seriously interfere with the conduct of macroeconomic policy

and, with it, macroeconomic stability.

Blanchard (1979) proposed another reason for rational speculation producing the wrong rate, known as a

**rational bubble** . An exchange rate bubble exists when holders of a currency realize that it is overvalued but

are nevertheless willing to hold it, since they believe that the appreciation will continue for a while longer

and that there is only a limited risk of a serious depreciation during a given holding period. So speculators

expect to be able to sell eventually at an exchange rate that will provide them with a sufficient capital gain

to compensate them for running the risk of a sudden collapse. Such speculation both prolongs an exchange

- vervaluation and aggravates the macroeconomic costs associated with it.

Hence, there are a variety of arguments as to why private speculation may be destabilizing, and such

destabilizing speculation is o,en used as an argument for a !xed exchange rate and against a floating

exchange rate. However, we have to be extremely careful here because a !xed exchange rate can be !xed at

the wrong rate, just as a floating rate can float to a wrong rate. Even if a !xed exchange rate is initially !xed

at the optimal exchange rate, when the economic fundamentals change the !xed parity then becomes the

wrong rate.

10.3 THE CASE FOR FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES

Te case for floating exchange rates is a mixture of positive arguments in favour of floating and arguments

against !xed exchange rates. Again, caution is warranted with the arguments against !xed exchange rates

because they do not necessarily constitute arguments for completely floating exchange rates.

_Floating exchange rates ensure balance of payments equilibrium_

Proponents of floating exchange rates argue that in a floating regime the exchange rate automatically adjusts to

ensure continuous equilibrium between the demand for and supply of the currency. If a country is running an

unsustainable current account de!cit, its exchange rate will depreciate which will reduce imports and increase

exports until the balance of payments is restored to a sustainable level. Conversely, a structural surplus in

the balance of payments will lead to an exchange rate appreciation that will reduce the surplus to sustainable

levels.

In other words, floating exchange rates ensure a balance between the demand for and supply of a currency:

excess demand leads to an appreciation, whereas excess supply leads to a depreciation. Tis contrasts to the

scenario under !xed exchange rates where an overvalued rate leads to an excess supply and thereby a fall in

the authorities' reserves, while !xing it at an undervalued rate leads to excess demand and an increase in the

authorities' reserves. Even if by chance the authorities initially peg the exchange rate at the point where supply

equals demand, that rate will soon become inappropriate when a change in the economic fundamentals

a$ects the supply or demand for the currency. Exchange rate adjustments, by taking care of the balance of

payments de!cits, relieve the authorities of having to adopt unpopular alternatives such as deflation or resort

to protectionism which could even provoke a damaging trade war.

_Floating exchange rates ensure monetary autonomy_

One of the major arguments put forward in favour of floating exchange rates is that they enable each country to

- perate an independent monetary policy; that is, they restore **monetary autonomy** enabling each country to
determine its own inflation rate. Countries that prefer low inflation rates are free to adopt tight macroeconomic
policies and experience appreciating currencies, while countries that pursue expansionary macroeconomic
policies will su$er higher inflation and depreciating currencies. Tis contrasts with what happens under
!xed exchange rates where the need to have common inflation rates to maintain competitiveness constrains
countries to pursue similar monetary policies.

_Floating exchange rates insulate economies_

A further argument put forward in favour of floating exchange rates is that they can **insulate** the domestic

economy from foreign price shocks. If there is an increase in foreign prices under floating exchange rates,

provided the exchange rate moves roughly in line with PPP, the domestic currency would merely appreciate, so

preventing the country from importing foreign inflation. Tis contrasts to what happens under !xed exchange

rates where a foreign price rise makes the home economy over-competitive, leading to a balance of payments

surplus which necessitates purchases of the foreign currency with newly created domestic currency to peg the

exchange rate. Te increase in the domestic money supply leads to an accompanying rise in domestic prices,

thus ending the surplus. Hence, !xed exchange rates lead to the importing of foreign price inflation/deflation

(see Chapter 5).

234

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

_Floating exchange rates promote economic stability_

A forceful argument put forward by Friedman (1953) in favour of flexible exchange rates is that it is better

to let exchange rates adjust in response to shocks to the economy than !x the exchange rate and force the

adjustment onto other economic variables. He argued that floating exchange rates are more conducive to

economic stability. Te exchange rate is a variable which can easily rise or fall, whereas domestic prices tend

to be very difficult to reduce. Hence, if there is a loss of international competitiveness it is better to allow the

exchange rate (one price) to depreciate rather than maintain a !xed exchange rate and require deflationary

policies to restore international competitiveness. Since the domestic price level is resistant to downward

pressure, it may require quite severe deflationary policies with associated high unemployment to induce the

fall in domestic wages and prices necessary to restore international competitiveness.

_Private speculation is stabilizing_

Te advocates of floating exchange rates argue that private speculators are a stabilizing rather than

destabilizing force. It is in the interests of speculators to move the exchange rate to its fundamental economic

value. Speculators will attempt to buy the currency at a low value and sell it at a high value and in so doing

reduce the gap between the low and high values. Of course, occasionally speculators will make mistakes and

buy a currency which they think has depreciated sufficiently and !nd that it continues to depreciate – such

destabilizing speculation will involve losses. Tis being the case, there is every reason to suppose that private

speculators will move the exchange rate towards its fundamental equilibrium value.

Many of the preceding arguments advanced for and against the two regimes are extremely difficult if

not impossible to prove. No doubt there are elements of truth on both sides of the argument. Speculation

can at times be stabilizing and at other times may be destabilizing. Fixed exchange rates can provide a

stable framework for international trade but so too can floating rates by ensuring countries maintain their

international competitiveness. Economic policies can be more or less stable under a !xed exchange rate

regime as compared to a floating one.

Since the traditional advantages/disadvantages approach leaves plenty of scope for disagreement, this

has stimulated an alternative, more modern approach to evaluating the two regimes. In this approach, the

relative merits of the two regimes are evaluated within the context of a formal macroeconomic model. We

now look at the insights provided by this alternative approach by using a relatively simple macroeconomic

model.

10.4 THE MODERN EVALUATION OF FIXED AND FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES

Te modern exchange rate literature has attempted to evaluate the choice between !xed and flexible exchange

rates by seeing which regime best stabilizes the domestic economy in the face of various shocks to the

economy. Te exchange rate regime that provides the most stability to the domestic economy is deemed

to be the preferred regime. As we shall see, although more sophisticated, this literature does not provide

an unambiguous answer to the question of which is the best exchange rate regime. What it shows is that

the choice between the two regimes is crucially dependent upon a multiplicity of factors. In our model, we

highlight three of these factors: the speci!cation of the objective function of the authorities as between price

and output stability, the type of shock impinging upon the economy, and the structural parameters of the

economy.

235

International Finance

10.5 SPECIFICATION OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION

Tere are many factors that the authorities have to take into account when designing their policies. Most

importantly, they have to decide what are their objectives and the weight to be attached to each of them. For

simplicity we shall deal with an economy where the authorities have two objectives: price and output stability.

Te aim of the authorities is viewed as being the minimization of fluctuations of the price level ( _P_ ) and output

level ( _Y_ ) around their target values. Te authorities will wish to minimize the value of the following objective

function:

O( _P_, _Y_ ) = _w_ ( _Y_           - _Yn_ ) [2] + (1 – _w_ ) ( _P_           - _Pn_ ) [2] 0 4 _w_ 4 1

where _w_ is the relative weight attached to each of the two objectives in the overall objective function, _Yn_ is the

natural/target value for domestic real income and _Pn_ is the natural/target value for the domestic price level.

Te idea of incorporating a weighted objective function is that there may be a trade-o$ for the authorities

between income and price stability. Some authorities may attach a high weight to price stability, whereas others

may attach a high priority to income stability, and a weighted objective function allows for this possibility.

A value of _w_ = 1 means that the objective involves only domestic income stability, whereas if _w_ = 0 the sole

concern is with price stability.

10.6 THE MODEL

We now investigate the choice between !xed and flexible exchange rate regimes for an economy that is bu$eted

by various transitory shocks. Te fact that the shocks are assumed to be transitory, that is self-reversing,

means that the next period is an important assumption because it means that the economy is always expected

to return to its natural price ( _Pn_ ) and output level ( _Yn_ ). In terms of the model, it means some simple rules can

be made concerning expectations. If the exchange rate depreciates today it is expected to appreciate back to its

normal level in the next period. Similarly, if the price or output levels rise above their normal levels they will

be expected to go back to their normal levels in the next period. In the model that follows, we shall examine

the performance of !xed and floating exchange rate regimes in the face of three types of transitory shocks:

money demand, aggregate demand and aggregate supply. All variables except interest rates are expressed in

logarithms.

Te demand for the home country's money is a positive function of the aggregate price index, is a positive

function of real domestic income and is inversely related to the domestic nominal interest rate. Tat is:

_Md_ t = _Pi_ t + ( _Y_ t – 2 _r_ t + _Ut_ 1 (10.1)

where _Md_ t is the demand to hold money in the current period _t_, _Pi_ t is the currently observable aggregate price

index made up of a weighted average of the domestic and foreign price levels as set out in equation (10.1a),

_Y_ t is the real domestic income in period _t_, _r_ t is the domestic nominal interest rate in current period _t_ which is

a currently observable !nancial variable and _Ut_ 1 is a transitory money demand shock term with zero mean

and normal distribution.

Te idea of incorporating the aggregate price index in the demand for money function is derived from

the monetarist proposition that the demand to hold money is a demand for real balances related to the

purchasing power of money. Te aggregate price index is a weighted average of the domestic price level and

236

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

the domestic price of the imported foreign good, which is equal to the exchange rate times the price of the

foreign good. Tat is:

_Pi_ t = + _P_ t + (1 – +)( _s_ t + _P_ t*) 0 < + 4 1 (10.1a)

where + is the weight of the domestic good in the overall consumption basket, _s_ t is the exchange rate de!ned

as domestic currency per unit of foreign currency in the current period, _P_ t is the price of domestic good in the

current period and _P_ t* is the price of the imported foreign good in the foreign currency in the current period.

Te demand for domestic output is a positive function of the real exchange rate and inversely related to the

domestic real interest rate and a positive function of the natural level of income. Tat is:

_Yd_ t = 1 ( _s_ t + _P_ t* – _P_ t) – * ( _r_ t + _P_ t – _P_ t + 1/t) + 0 _Yn_ + _Ut_ 2 (10.2)

where _P_ t+1/t is the expected price level in one period's time given the information available in the current

period, _Yn_ is the natural level of output and _Ut_ 2 is a transitory aggregate demand shock term with zero mean

and normal distribution.

Te real exchange rate is given by the !rst bracketed expression; an appreciation of the exchange rate would

reduce the demand for the domestic good. Similarly, the real domestic interest rate is given by the second

bracketed expression and is equivalent to the nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of price inflation.

A rise in the real interest rate will act to reduce the current demand for the domestic good.

Te supply of domestic output depends upon the price at which producers are able to sell their output

relative to the wage rate that they must pay per unit of labour. Tat is:

_Ys_ t = 5 ( _P_ t – _W_ t) + _Ut_ 3 (10.3)

_Ys_ t = _Ys_ t( _L_ t)   where 6 _Ys_ t/6 _L_ t > 0 and 6 [2] _Ys_ t/ 6 [2] _L_ t < 0 (10.3a)

where _Ys_ t is the supply of the domestic good, _L_ t is labour input, and _Ut_ 3 is a transitory aggregate supply shock

term with zero mean and normal distribution.

Equation (10.3) states that if the price of the domestic good rises relative to the wage rate, domestic producers

will increase their output and employment levels as the real wage facing them falls; while equation (10.3a)

states that output is a positive function of labour input but is subject to the law of diminishing returns. It is

assumed that !nancial capital is perfectly mobile and that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes.

As a result, the UIP condition is assumed to hold continuously. Tat is:

_r_ t = _r_ t* + ( _s_ t+1/t – _s_ t) (10.4)

where _r_ t* is the foreign interest rate in the current period and _s_ t+1/t is the expected exchange rate in period _t_ %+%1

given the information available at time _t_ . Te expression ( _s_ t+1/t– _s_ t) gives the expected rate of depreciation of

the currency.

Te contracting arrangement that determines the setting of nominal wages is central to the behaviour of

the model. Te contracts have a duration of one period and establish a nominal base wage _W_ t. It is assumed

that the base wage _W_ t is set at the level required to generate an expected level of output at the natural level _Yn_,

which is also the target level of the authorities:

_W_ t = _W_ t* (10.5)

237

International Finance

where _W_ t* is the wage rate that will in the absence of any shocks to the economy lead to full employment at

the natural rate of output.

In order to close the model we require the simultaneous ful!lment of the following two equations: that

money demand in the current period ( _Md_ t) equals the current money supply ( _Ms_ t), and that current aggregate

supply equals current aggregate demand. Tat is:

_Ms_ t = _Md_ t (10.6)

_Ys_ t = _Yd_ t (10.7)

Under !xed exchange rates, perfect capital mobility means that the domestic interest rate equals the

foreign interest rate and the money supply is endogenously determined. On the other hand, under floating

exchange rates the money supply is exogenously determined and the domestic interest rate and exchange

rate are endogenously determined but tied together via the UIP condition. We now set out the model using a

diagrammatic exposition.

10.7 DETERMINING EQUILIBRIUM

We use for exposition purposes the aggregate supply and demand schedules de!ned by equations (10.2)

and (10.3) respectively, and also make use of the money market curve as set out by equation (10.1). Initial

equilibrium is found where all three schedules intersect, as shown in Figure 10.1.

Te aggregate demand schedule is given by _Yd_ and is derived from equation (10.2); it is downward-sloping

because a rise in the domestic price level leads to a fall in aggregate demand for the domestic good, _ceteris_

_paribus_, for two reasons. Firstly, by inducing a decline in net exports, and secondly, since any rise in the

domestic price level leads to a future expected return of the price to its target level, the expected rate of price

Price level

_P_ n

0 _Y_ n Real income

**Figure 10.1** Equilibrium of the model

238

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

inflation will be negative, which raises the real interest rate. Te absolute slope of the _Yd_ schedule is given by

the reciprocal of the summation of the elasticities of aggregate demand with respect to the real exchange rate

and real interest rate, that is, 1/(1 + *).

_Md_ depicts the money demand schedule derived from equation (10.1) of the model; it also has a negative

slope because a rise in the domestic price level increases the demand for money, requiring a fall in real income

to maintain money demand equilibrium. Te absolute slope of the _Md_ schedule is given by the income

elasticity of money demand divided by the share of the domestic good in the aggregate price index, that is, (/+.

Te slope of the _Yd_ schedule may be flatter or steeper than the _Md_ schedule and this proves to be critical

when comparing !xed and floating exchange rates in the face of an aggregate supply shock. Te condition

for the _Yd_ schedule to be flatter than the _Md_ schedule is that ( (1 + *) > +. For most of the analysis we shall

assume that this condition is satis!ed. Obviously, it is more likely to be satis!ed the more open the economy

(that is, the smaller is +) and the greater the elasticity of the demand for the home good with respect to the

real exchange rate and real interest rate. However, in order to see the importance of the relative slopes, in the

case of an aggregate supply shock, both cases are examined.

Te aggregate supply curve has a positive slope since a rise in the domestic price level for a !xed nominal

wage reduces the real wage facing producers, encouraging them to take on more workers which results in

increased output. It has a positive slope given by 1/5.

Equilibrium of the system is determined by the simultaneous interaction of all three schedules through a

common point. In the absence of unanticipated disturbances to the economy, output is at its natural level _Yn_

and the price level at the natural level _Pn_ . In the analysis, we shall also assume that these are the optimal target

values of the authorities, so that the economy is initially in full equilibrium.

If the system is initially in full equilibrium, only unanticipated disturbances will cause the schedules to

shi, from their equilibrium levels, inducing corresponding adjustments in price and output. Under !xed

exchange rates the money stock adjusts passively to shi,s in the _Ys_ and _Yd_ schedules because the money stock

is endogenously determined, whereas under floating exchange rates the exchange rate and interest rate adjust

to equilibrate the system causing shi,s in both the _Md_ and _Yd_ schedules. For example, an appreciation of the

exchange rate shi,s the _Yd_ schedule to the le, due to a loss of competitiveness, with a resulting fall in exports,

as well as the fact that an appreciation leads to an expected future depreciation as the shocks impinging upon

the economy are known to be self-reversing. As a result, the domestic interest rate is forced up further to

maintain UIP, shi,ing the _Yd_ schedule to the le,. Te rise in the domestic interest rate, to the extent that the

demand for money is interest-elastic, lowers the demand for money which for a given money stock requires a

shi, to the right of the _Md_ schedule. We now compare the relative performance of !xed and floating exchange

rates in the face of various shocks to the economy.

10.8 MONEY DEMAND SHOCK

Suppose that there is an unanticipated rise in money demand, as depicted in Figure 10.2. Tis has the e$etc of

shi,ing the _Md_ schedule to the le,. It is assumed that there are no other shocks impinging upon the economy.

An increase in money demand causes a shi, to the le, of the money demand schedule from _Md_ 1 to _Md_ 2.

Under !xed exchange rates the excess demand for money will cause a tendency for the currency to appreciate.

As a result the authorities have to purchase the foreign currency in the foreign exchange market, which

expands the domestic money stock. Te purchases continue until the _Md_ 2 schedule shi,s back to _Md_ 1. Tus,

short-run equilibrium remains at point A under !xed exchange rates with no disturbance to either domestic

prices or domestic output. Tis means that !xed exchange rates prove optimal. In e$etc, all the authorities do

239

is increase the money stock in line with the increased demand to hold money so that there are no required

adjustments to price and output.

If we are in a floating exchange rate regime the appreciation of the exchange rate shi,s _Yd_ 1 to the le, to

_Yd_ 2 due to the fall o$ in export demand and rise in the domestic interest rate as there is an expected future

depreciation of the currency. Te rise in the interest rate leads to a fall o$ in money demand, shi,ing _Md_ 2 to

_Md_ 3. Temporary equilibrium is attained where all three schedules intersect at point C. Tus, it can be seen

that under floating exchange rates a rise in the demand to hold money leads to a fall in both the domestic price

and output level. From this, it is obvious that, whether the principal objective is price or output stabilization,

!xed exchange rates are preferable for dealing with monetary shocks and in fact prove optimal.

10.9 AGGREGATE DEMAND SHOCK

Assume that there is an unanticipated increase in aggregate demand, as depicted in Figure 10.3. Tis has the

e$etc of shi,ing the _Yd_ schedule to the right.

An increase in aggregate demand shi,s _Yd_ 1 to _Yd_ 2. Tis means that there is an excess demand for money

which will cause the exchange rate to appreciate. As a result, the authorities have to intervene in the foreign

exchange market to purchase the foreign money with newly created domestic money so that _Md_ 1 shi,s to

_Md_ 2 and the excess money demand is eliminated. Tus, under !xed exchange rates short-run equilibrium is

found at point B with rises in both the domestic price and output level to _P_ 2 and _Y_ 2 respectively.

If, however, the authorities allow the exchange rate to float, the excess demand for money will result in an

appreciation of the domestic currency which will have two e$ects: the aggregate demand schedule will shi, to

the le, from _Yd_ 2 to _Yd_ 3 due to the fall o$ in exports, and the money demand schedule will shi, to the right

from _Md_ 1 to _Md_ 3 due to the rise in the domestic interest rate. Equilibrium of the system is obtained at point

C with price _P_ 3 and output _Y_ 3.

**Figure 10.3** Aggregate demand shock

From this, it is evident that in the case of an aggregate demand disturbance, whether the objective of the

authorities is price or output stability, floating exchange rates outperform !xed rates.

10.10 AGGREGATE SUPPLY SHOCK

Assume that there is an unanticipated fall in aggregate supply. Tis has the e$etc of shi,ing the aggregate

supply schedule to the le,. Here it is necessary to distinguish two cases: in case 1 the _Md_ schedule is steeper

than the _Yd_ schedule, while in case 2 the _Yd_ schedule is steeper than the _Md_ schedule.

Te economy is initially in equilibrium at point A in Figure 10.4 with price _Pn_ and output _Yn_ . Te economy

is then hit by a transitory inflationary supply shock which shi,s _Ys_ 1 to _Ys_ 2. In this case, point B corresponds

to a position of excess supply of money, hence there is a tendency for the currency to depreciate. In order to

maintain a !xed exchange rate the authorities have to contract the money supply until the excess supply is

eliminated, so the _Md_ schedule shi,s from _Md_ 1 to M _d_ 2. Tus, under !xed exchange rates the inflationary

supply shock leads to a rise in price to _P_ 2 and a fall in output to _Y_ 2.

If, however, the authorities allow the exchange rate to float, the excess supply of money resulting from

the aggregate supply shock will lead to a depreciation of the currency. Te depreciation shi,s the aggregate

demand schedule to the right from _Yd_ 1 to _Yd_ 2 since it results in increased export sales of the domestic good.

Furthermore, the depreciation leads to an expected appreciation and therefore a fall in the domestic interest

rate which leads to an increased demand to hold money which shi,s the money demand schedule from _Md_ 1

to _Md_ 3. Equilibrium of the system under floating exchange rates is therefore obtained at point C with a rise in

price to _P_ 3 and a fall in output to _Y_ 3.

From this, we notice that our evaluation of the choice between !xed and floating exchange rate regimes

would depend primarily upon the objectives of the authorities. Tis is because !xed exchange rates favour

price stability while floating exchange rates favour income stability. Clearly, if the objective function of

the authorities is biased towards price stability, they would !nd !xed rates preferable to floating ones. If,

however, the authorities are more concerned with output stability, they would !nd floating rates preferable

to !xed ones. Tis is a good illustration of the importance of the speci!cation of the objective function:

depending upon the weighting of the objective function, either !xed or floating exchange rates could be

deemed superior.

In Figure 10.5 we again assume that there is a transitory inflationary aggregate supply shock that shi,s the

aggregate supply function from _Ys_ 1 to _Ys_ 2; this time, however, the money demand schedule is less steep than

the aggregate demand schedule.

In this case, the aggregate supply shock under !xed exchange rates causes there to be an excess demand

for money at point B, and consequently there is a tendency for the currency to appreciate. In order to avoid

an appreciation of the currency the authorities intervene in the foreign exchange market to purchase the

foreign currency, resulting in an increase in the domestic money stock until the _Md_ schedule shi,s from

_Md_ 1 to _Md_ 2. Te end result under !xed exchange rates is that the domestic price level rises to _P_ 2 and output

falls to _Y_ 2.

Under floating exchange rates, the excess demand for money resulting from the shock leads to an

appreciation of the exchange rate. Tis has the e$etc of shi,ing the aggregate demand schedule to the le, from

_Yd_ 1 to _Yd_ 2. In addition, the appreciation leads to the expectation of a future depreciation which, via the UIP

condition, raises the domestic interest rate, constituting an additional reason for the le,ward shi, of the _Yd_

schedule. Te rise in the domestic interest rate by reducing the demand for money shi,s the _Md_ schedule to

the right from _Md_ 1 to _Md_ 3. Te result is that short-run equilibrium under floating exchange rates is obtained

at point C with a rise in the domestic price level to _P_ 3 and a fall in domestic output to _Y_ 3.

In this case, we again observe a conflict when choosing between !xed and floating exchange rates. Te

di$erence is that in this instance !xed exchange rates favour output stability while floating exchange rates

favour price stability.

Te point of including this second case is that it illustrates the point that the choice between !xed and

floating exchange rates is very closely related to the structural parameters of the economy. In the !rst case,

greater output stability could be obtained by floating exchange rates, while in the second case !xed exchange

rates prove superior. From this, it follows that any policy recommendations should be based on a study of the

characteristics of the particular economy. Even if economies have similar objectives and face similar shocks

we may be led to make di$erent policy recommendations due to structural di$erences between economies.

Te results of the analysis of our model are summarized in Table 10.1.

Table 10.1 reveals that the choice between !xed and floating exchange rates is nowhere near as clear-cut as

their advocates are prone to argue. Te choice between the two regimes is seen to depend crucially upon the

type of shock impinging upon the economy, the objectives of the authorities and the structural parameters of

the particular economy considered (the steepness of the _Md_ schedule relative to the _Yd_ schedule).

Before concluding this section it is worth reminding readers that the model set out is extremely simple. In

practice, the choice between a !xed or floating exchange rate will be more complex. We have considered only

the case of transitory shocks, but economies are subjected to both transitory and permanent disturbances.

In addition, some economies have wage indexation, while others do not – indexation will lead to wage

adjustments following movements in the domestic price level or the exchange rate, which can alter the ranking

- f the two regimes (see Pilbeam, 1991). Finally, we have not touched upon the problem of interdependence:
while a !xed exchange rate may be the preferred choice for one economy, its trading partners may prefer a
floating regime. If this is the case, the appropriate exchange rate regime for the two countries is clearly greatly
complicated.

10.11 MANAGED FLOATING

Since the advent of floating exchange rates in 1973 it has become evident that authorities have not always let

their currency float freely but rather they have frequently intervened to influence it. A number of rationales

have been put forward to justify such intervention and are worth consideration.

Before examining some of the most frequently used arguments for intervention it is necessary to assume

that the authorities can influence the nominal and/or real exchange rate in their desired direction – without

such an assumption no rationale for intervention can exist. Further, when assessing the validity of intervention

policy it is necessary to compare exchange market intervention with alternative policies. Only if it can be

demonstrated that intervention has a superior bene!t to cost impact than other policies, or that constraints

prevent the use of superior policies, can exchange market intervention be justi!ed. It should be remembered

throughout that exchange rate management by the authorities can vary in degree from occasional intervention

to influencing the exchange rate to a permanent pegging.

Te arguments for some degree of discretionary intervention to some extent overlap, but fall into three

main categories: (i) the authorities can choose an exchange rate more in line with economic fundamentals

than the market; (ii) intervention is required to mitigate the costs of exchange rate 'overshooting'; and (iii)

intervention is an appropriate instrument for smoothing necessary economic adjustments.

_Authorities might be able to produce a more appropriate exchange rate_

As we argued in section 10.2, for a variety of reasons the exchange rate produced by the market may be the

wrong rate compared to underlying economic fundamentals. Te market may use the wrong model, it may

have the wrong perception about the future and it will have difficulty in interpreting the implications of

news relevant to the exchange rate. However, the fact that the market may produce the wrong rate does not

justify intervention by the authorities: it is necessary to demonstrate that the authorities can choose a more

appropriate rate.

Tere exists a case for intervention if the news or information available to the market is efficiently used but

the news itself is either inadequate – increasing risk – or misleading, and the authorities are in possession of

superior relevant information. Intervention in such circumstances can prove both stabilizing and pro!table.

However, it could be argued that a superior policy is for the authorities to abstain from intervention and

release the relevant information to the market. Nevertheless, there may be circumstances under which such

an information-release is not considered desirable, and even if the authorities were to release the relevant

information to the market, there is no guarantee that the market would believe them.

244

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

Connected with the above argument is a far more convincing reason for the authorities to intervene. While

it may be the case that the authorities do not know any more than the market regarding what is the correct rate,

they should know better and sooner what they themselves are about to do (in most cases!). Since the exchange

rate is an asset price, it incorporates expectations concerning its future price appropriately discounted into the

current price so that unusual _ex ante_ speculative pro!ts cannot be made. For example, if the money supply

is expected to increase at a given date in the future, this implies a depreciation of the exchange rate; if the

exchange rate did not depreciate until the expected increase in the money supply took place, this would imply

a large discrete depreciation of the exchange rate at that time. However, since the depreciation was expected

such a discrete jump would imply a missed abnormal _ex ante_ pro!t opportunity. Since the foreign exchange

market is efficient, the expectation of a depreciation leads to a smaller discrete depreciation of the current rate

(reflecting the news of future monetary expansion), with a gradual depreciation therea,er until the actual

increase in the money supply takes place. In this way all anticipated disturbances are fully discounted and

therefore unusual _ex ante_ pro!t opportunities eliminated.

Te point is that the authorities should be more capable than the market in predicting the future course

- f their policies, and this is of relevance to the correct exchange rate. Given this, intervention in the foreign
exchange market may be interpreted by the market as a commitment by the authorities to adopt a given course

- f action; if this is the case, economic agents may more readily lend their support to the new policy, helping to
make it more e$ective and more speedily implemented than would otherwise be the case. Tus, there exists a
case for official intervention on the grounds that the authorities have a better knowledge of their future policy
intentions than private market participants. Official intervention in the foreign exchange market may literally
'buy credibility', convincing economic agents that the authorities intend to ful!l their stated domestic policy
targets by committing the assets of the central bank in support of its declared future policy. A key postulate of
the rational expectations literature is that the authorities will only be able to achieve their short-run inflation

- bjectives painlessly if economic agents are convinced that the authorities intend to carry out their stated
- bjectives. Te opportunity to purchase some credibility by intervening in the foreign exchange market could
prove to be a useful policy tool.

To illustrate the above point, consider the case where there is news of an increase in the rate of growth of

the money supply. Tis may be viewed as a$ecting speculators’ expectations in at least three possible ways: it

may be seen as only a transitory development of a countercyclical nature that will subsequently be reversed;

it may be seen as a once and for all change in the money stock that will not be reversed but which will

not a$etc the underlying rate of growth of the money stock; or alternatively it may be seen as heralding a

more permanent increase in the rate of growth of the money stock. Each of the alternatives has di$erent

implications concerning the required depreciation of the currency: the greater the actual growth the greater

the required depreciation. Tere is no a priori reason to believe that the market, in the short run at least, will

- n balance know what is the required depreciation; the authorities, however, should know and could indicate
their feelings regarding the appropriate rate via an intervention policy.

_Intervention needed to mitigate costs of exchange rate overshooting_

Te Dornbusch (1976) overshooting model examined in Chapter 7 showed that a move to monetary restraint

can lead to a short-run real exchange rate appreciation, while an expansionary monetary policy can lead to

a real depreciation. Tese real exchange rate movements (overand undervaluations in relation to PPP) will

exert e$ects on the real economy. In what follows we shall refer to substantial and prolonged deviations from

PPP as exchange rate misalignments.

245

International Finance

Misaligned exchange rates distort the allocation of resources between tradables and non-tradables as well

as consumption patterns between the two. Undervaluation by raising the domestic price level and placing

downward pressure on real wages may spark o$ inflationary pressures, while overvaluation by squeezing the

tradables sector may result in increased unemployment. Misalignment complicates and inhibits investment

decisions because uncertainty as to the duration of the over/undervaluation will a$etc the pro!tability

calculations concerning whether to invest in tradables or non-tradables, particularly inhibiting marginal

investment decisions.

Misalignments almost certainly exert a ratchet e$etc on protectionism. In periods of undervaluation of the

currency, resources that would ordinarily not be viable enter into the tradables sector but as the rate corrects

itself they will come under increasing pressure and will then seek recourse to protection. Alternatively, if

the currency is overvalued this will tend to lead to automatic protectionist cries due to the pressure on the

tradables sector. It should also be remembered that undervaluation for one currency involves overvaluation

for another and vice versa, so that one could expect protectionism to be a global and persistent phenomenon

so long as exchange rates are misaligned. Since an under/overvaluation must necessarily eventually be

corrected, which will involve various adjustment costs arising because of factor immobility, occupationally

and geographically, retraining of labour will involve costs and time, and absorption cannot be painlessly

varied at will.

Foreign exchange intervention designed to reduce the costs and extent of exchange rate overshooting

could be justi!ed. It is worth noting that the case for intervention in this instance is not in any way due to

inefficiency in the foreign exchange market. Te rate produced by the market is the correct rate but because

- f 'sticky' goods prices there are short-run real exchange rate changes. If the price level increased (decreased)
by _x_ % immediately following an _x_ % change in the money supply, as in the flexible price monetary model,
there would be no overshooting of the exchange rate. Tis latter observation has led some authors to propose
that rather than intervene in the foreign exchange market, the authorities should tackle the inefficiencies in
the goods and labour markets. If these markets were made more flexible so that the rate of inflation adjusted
quickly to changes in monetary policy, then this would reduce the amount of overshooting. Te measures
proposed would include anti-trust legislation, reductions in trade union power and the reduction of social
security bene!ts, all of which would make goods and factor prices more flexible and thereby reduce the
problem of overshooting. Not surprisingly, by comparison to the likely resistance and turmoil associated with
such policies, exchange market intervention can prove a superior policy tool.

_Intervention to smooth the economic adjustment process_

Tere may exist a rationale for the authorities to intervene in the foreign exchange market to achieve a

preferable exchange rate in the short run to permit a smoothing of the necessary adjustments that the

economy must for various reasons undergo. Te rationale for smoothing the adjustment process is that it

is a painful process for those who have to adjust and is more acceptable at a controlled pace than a marketdetermined pace.

Suppose that a country has a persistent balance of payments surplus because the traded goods sector is too

large relative to the non-traded sector. Tere will consequently be a tendency for an appreciation of the real

exchange rate which will encourage factors to move from the traded goods sector to the non-traded sector.

If the authorities are concerned about the possibility of large transitional unemployment resulting from

such an appreciation, they may try to moderate the appreciation to allow time for the traded goods sector to

contract and the non-tradables sector to expand, so as to avoid what they consider to be excessive transitional

unemployment costs. Corden (1982) has coined the phrase 'exchange rate protection' to describe an exchange

246

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

rate policy whereby a country protects its tradable goods sector relative to the non-tradables sector, by either

devaluing the real exchange rate, allowing the exchange rate to depreciate by more than it otherwise would, or

preventing an exchange rate appreciation that would otherwise take place.

Te preceding case is only one variant of the need to switch resources in the economy; another may occur

when the tradables sector itself is divided into 'booming' and 'lagging' sectors. Te booming sector will cause

the real exchange rate to have a tendency to appreciate, and in so doing will speed up the demise of the lagging

sector. In either of the two cases cited, the case for exchange rate protection is clearly linked to the speed at

which adjustment can take place, be it between the traded and non-traded sector or within the tradables

sector.

Exchange market intervention can compare favourably to other methods of protection for the purpose of

slowing down the necessary adjustment, such as tari$ protection. Tis is because exchange rate protection,

which involves influencing the real exchange rate and with it the accumulation of reserves, must necessarily be

a temporary method of protection, whereas tari$s and subsidies have a habit of becoming permanent features

and, because of their explicit protective nature, tend to invite retaliation. Nevertheless, it is difficult to say that

either form of protection is to be preferred, for while tari$s distort production patterns within the tradables

sector in favour of the lagging (protected) sector, exchange rate protection protects all tradables whether they

require assistance or not, and it could be argued that because it is a more widespread means of protection it is

more likely to invite retaliation.

Another rationale for intervention may exist if the economy is caught in a 'vicious circle'. Consider a

country experiencing for whatever reason a current account de!cit that it is trying to eliminate by permitting

the depreciation of its currency. If wages adjust fully and instantaneously to the increased domestic price

level implied by such a policy, and the authorities adopt an accommodating monetary policy to avoid

an increase in unemployment, the country will be back where it started. A further depreciation will be

necessary and via the same process this will again lead the country back to where it started; the country will

be caught in a vicious circle of depreciation, price rises, wage rises and then further depreciation. Under

such circumstances, intervention in the foreign exchange market may serve to slow down or even avoid the

spiral, allowing the authorities to adopt a more appropriate policy designed to bring about the necessary

reduction in real wages or to await productivity improvements in the economy which means that real wages

do not have to fall.

It should be noted, however, that the real issue behind the vicious-circle argument for intervention concerns

the e$ectiveness of di$erent policy instruments in bringing about the ultimate reduction in real wages that

is essential for adjustment (in the absence of productivity improvements), while minimizing the harmful

consequences for other macro-objectives, such as the maintenance of full employment and reasonable price

stability. Here one should recall Keynes' argument that price changes may prove a more acceptable method

- f reducing real wages because they hit the labour force more or less equally, and by so doing do not upset to
any great extent wage di$erentials. Te alternative policy of deflation may prove a more painful process for
reducing real wages, especially with regard to the employment objective because it may require a large rise in
unemployment before the principle of real wage cuts becomes accepted by the labour force. Tus, there may
be a case in the vicious-circle argument for government intervention to slow down the rate of depreciation so
that real wages are reduced only gradually at a more acceptable pace.

Before concluding this section, it is worth emphasizing that the adjustment arguments advanced for

exchange rate management involve smoothing the adjustment process, not preventing it. Ideally, the exchange

rate should be allowed to adjust towards its equilibrium rate at an optimum pace, the determination of which

is clearly a policy problem. It is the acceptance of the principle of exchange rate adjustment that ensures that

the required changes in the economy do take place.

10.12 CONCLUSIONS

Te clear result that emerges from this chapter is that neither the traditional advantages/disadvantages

approach nor modern literature provide a clear-cut reason to prefer !xed exchange rates to floating ones or

vice versa. Fixed exchange rates have some advantages and disadvantages as compared to floating exchange

rates. Indeed, many of the proposed advantages can under some circumstances be viewed as disadvantages.

For example, floating exchange rates restore monetary autonomy, but whether this is a good or bad thing will

depend upon whether the authorities use the autonomy wisely.

Te modern approach to evaluating the two regimes shows that only under very speci!c conditions can

we say that one regime is better than the other. Our analysis has focused on three crucial factors which

determine the choice of exchange rate regime: the speci!cation of the objective function, the type of shock

impinging upon the economy, and the structure of the economy. In particular, the analysis highlights the

importance of the speci!cation of the objective function and demonstrates how a slight modi!cation to this

can completely reverse the ranking of the regimes. Di$erent countries, even if they have similar economic

structures and face similar shocks, may well require di$erent exchange rate regimes simply because their

- bjectives di$er.

Tere are a host of other factors that will complicate the choice of exchange rate regime, such as the

implications of wages indexation, the possibility of permanent shocks and the relationships between various

shocks. It should also be remembered that, in practice, it is extremely difficult to know if an economy is being

a7icted by a supply or demand shock or a shock to money demand. Even if a shock is identi!ed, there is the

question as to whether or not it is a permanent or transitory phenomenon.

Te lack of decisive arguments in favour of either !xed or floating exchange rates has frequently been

taken as a rationale for some degree of exchange rate management between the two regimes. Te argument

being that such exchange rate management has the potential to combine the advantages of both regimes,

while limiting the disadvantages. However, a demonstration that private speculation may produce the wrong

rate, or that exchange rates are prone to 'overshoot', does not by itself justify intervention. It is necessary to

demonstrate that the authorities can choose a more appropriate rate and that intervention can influence

the exchange rate in the desired direction. In addition, it is necessary to demonstrate that intervention

in%the%foreign exchange market is the best means of tackling the economic problem in hand. Instability of

the exchange rate may merely be due to unstable macroeconomic policies by the country concerned and

the%best means for reducing such fluctuations is to stabilize domestic economic policies, not intervention

in%the foreign exchange market.

Since there is no unique case for exchange rate management there can be no unique set of rules expected

to deal with the wide variety of circumstances that can arise. An appropriate intervention policy may involve

reducing or exacerbating exchange rate movements, intervention may need to be temporary or prolonged,

and the amount of intervention required will vary with the circumstances. In other words, even if intervention

can be justi!ed, the precise direction, duration and volume of intervention required need to be determined.

Finally, it should not be forgotten that we have examined the choice between alternative regimes within the

context of a particular model speci!cation of a small open economy. One of the implications of the analysis is

that di$erent countries may need to opt for di$erent exchange rate regimes. It may be the case that the choice

- f exchange rate policy by one country may well be a crucial factor in determining the choice of exchange rate
policy for other countries, and this is an issue that merits further research.
