11.1 INTRODUCTION

!e international monetary system is broadly defined as the set of conventions, rules, procedures and

institutions that govern the conduct of financial relations between nations. In this chapter we look in some

detail at the development of the post-Second World War international monetary system. An understanding of

the historical, institutional and economic developments that have occurred since the end of the Second World

War are an essential background to the study of international finance. Many of the proposals for reform of the

international monetary system have been based upon the desire to avoid the problems and mistakes of the

past. !ere are many facets of the post-war system that merit attention and that are studied in this chapter.

Among these are the Bretton Woods system and its eventual breakdown, the move to $oating exchange rates,

the economic events of the 1970s including two oil shocks, and the economic policy divergences of the 1980s.

!e setting-up of the European Monetary System (EMS), leading eventually to the achievement on 1 January

1999 of Economic and Monetary Union in Europe, is probably the most significant event to occur in the

evolution of the international monetary system since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.

!e 1990s witnessed considerable currency turmoil, which firstly a%icted developed economies with

speculative attacks launched against a number of EMS currencies including the British pound, the Italian

lira and the Spanish peseta. !e EMS crisis was followed by a series of currency and financial crises which

a%icted emerging market economies. In 1994–95 Mexico suffered what has become known as the 'tequila

crisis', but this proved to be merely a taster for the currency and financial turmoil that was to follow. In July

1997, a !ai baht devaluation marked an abrupt end to the 'Asian miracle' and the start of the 'Asian financial

crisis' which involved roughly one and a half years of unprecedented turbulence in the region's financial and

currency markets. Barely had the Asian crisis started to subside, when a new crisis broke out following an

effective Russian default on its domestic and foreign currency debts; the Russian crisis was accompanied

by concerns for the global capital markets when Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund

with massive speculative positions in the financial markets, was effectively bankrupted. !e Russian crisis

had a direct impact on Brazil which had its own currency crisis in 1999. !e new century started out with

its own set of crises, starting with a devaluation of the Turkish lira in 2001. !is was followed by the largest

ever default of $100 billion of external debt by Argentina in January 2002 and the ending of its experiment

with a currency board system that had since 1991 pegged its currency at a one peso–one US dollar parity.

!e Argentinian crisis eventually impacted upon Uruguay which was forced to $oat its currency later in

the year.

Much of the story of the post-war international monetary order is about the central role of the US dollar

which, despite the birth of the euro, remains the major international currency. However, even the dollar has

been subjected to considerable turbulence in the foreign exchange markets in recent years: it appreciated

sharply and unexpectedly against the euro upon the latter's birth from $1.174/&1 in January 1999 to $0.827/&1

- n 26 October 2000, where it steadied before depreciating and then rallying back until 11 June 2001, when it
started to depreciate from $0.843/&1 eventually reaching as low as $1.58/&1 in March 2008. !is was caused by
mounting concerns about the size of the US current account deficits and cuts in US interest rates to historically
low levels by the Federal Reserve.

!e frequent currency crises and ever-increasing international capital movements have led some

commentators to argue that there is no room for a halfway house when it comes to the choice of exchange

rate regime. !ey have argued that the international monetary system will increasingly become bipolar with

countries adopting the extremes of either a 'hard peg' or a $oating exchange rate. !is view has recently been

challenged on empirical grounds and there have been a number of recent studies that attempt empirically

to examine the relative merits of fixed, $oating and intermediate exchange rate regimes on the basis of their

association with economic performance, which we shall review. We will conclude by examining some recent

and older proposals for reform of the international monetary system.

11.2 THE BRETTON WOODS SYSTEM

!e initial talks on reconstructing a post-war international monetary system started between the United

States and the United Kingdom as early as 1941. !e lead negotiators were Harry Dexter White for the USA

and John Maynard Keynes for the British. Given the US economic and political dominance at the end of the

war, it is not surprising that the eventual system re$ected more the US proposals. !e system that emerged

252

The International Monetary System

was ratified at an international monetary conference held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, attended by

some 44 countries, although some commentators dubbed the conference a meeting of one and a half nations

(the USA and the UK!).

!e motivation behind creating a new international monetary order was the desire to avoid the breakdown

in international monetary relations that had occurred in the 1930s. In the 1920s Germany witnessed

hyperin$ation and the US stock market collapse of 1929 heralded a worldwide recession. !e 1930s were

marked by major trade imbalances which in turn led to the adoption of widespread protectionism, the

adoption of de$ationary policies, competitive devaluations and the abandonment of the gold exchange

standard. In an in$uential report for the League of Nations, Ragnar Nurkse (1944) argued that experience

with $oating exchange rates had shown that they discouraged international trade, caused a misallocation of

resources and were generally characterized by bouts of destabilizing speculation.

11.3 FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM

!ere were several important features to the system: a fixed but adjustable exchange rate and the setting-up

- f two new international organizations. !ese were the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with the duty
- f monitoring and supervising the system, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD), commonly known as the World Bank, charged initially with the role of assisting the reconstruction of
Europe's devastated economies. In fact, the World Bank is a pair of institutions – the IBRD and the International
Development Association – which obtains money from developed nations and lends out the funds to the
poorest, less-developed countries (LDCs) at concessional terms. A third institution, the International Finance
Corporation, is a'liated to the World Bank and provides risk capital direct to the private sector of LDCs.

_Fixed but adjustable exchange rates_

Bretton Woods established a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates. Under the Articles of Agreement

- f the IMF, each currency was assigned a central parity against the US dollar and was allowed to $uctuate by
plus or minus 1% either side of this parity. !e dollar itself was fixed to the price of gold at $35 per ounce.

!e idea of fixing the dollar to the price of gold was to provide confidence in the system. In 1945 the US

authorities held approximately 70% of the world's gold reserves. It was reasoned that foreign central banks

would be more willing to hold dollars in their reserves if they knew that they could be converted into gold. !e

US authorities made a commitment to keep the dollar convertible into gold at $35 dollars per ounce, which

in effect was a pledge on the part of the USA to preserve the purchasing power of dollars, making the dollar

'as good as gold'.

A country was expected to preserve the par value of its currency vis-à-vis the dollar, but, in the case of a

'fundamental disequilibrium' in its balance of payments, it could devalue or revalue its currency. Providing the

proposed change was less than 10% the IMF could not object, but larger realignments required the permission

- f the Fund. !e ability of a country to alter its par rate as a last resort was seen as an essential part of the
system: it offered countries an ultimate alternative to de$ation or import controls as a means of correcting
persistent balance of payments imbalances.

Under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, the member governments committed themselves to making

their currencies convertible for current account transactions as soon as was feasible. Convertibility for current

account transactions meant that, while governments could still employ capital controls, they could not prevent

their residents or residents of other countries from buying or selling their currency for current account

253

International Finance

transactions. It is notable, however, that such a commitment to convertibility was not required with respect to

capital account transactions. !is omission re$ected the widespread suspicion that capital movements were

potentially highly destabilizing.

_The IMF and credit facilities_

!e IMF was set up with its general objective being to oversee and promote international monetary cooperation

and the growth of world trade. To these ends, one of the principal tasks of the Fund was to ensure the smooth

functioning of the fixed exchange rate system – in particular, minimizing the need for countries to devalue

and revalue their currencies by providing them with credit facilities with which to finance temporary balance

- f payments deficits.

One of the major problems envisaged with the fixed exchange rate system was that countries facing a

temporary balance of payments deficit would be forced to de$ate their economies if they wished to maintain

their exchange rate parity. As most governments had committed themselves to the maintenance of full

employment, such a scenario was not particularly appealing. To avert this, a credit mechanism was set up

to provide support for countries facing transitory balance of payments problems. Avoidance of de$ationary

policies was viewed as helpful in maintaining the volume of world trade.

Under the credit facility, each member of the IMF was allocated a quota, the size of the quota being related

to its economic importance as re$ected in the size of its subscription to the Fund. A country had to place

- ne-quarter of its quota in reserve assets (mainly gold) and the remaining three-quarters in its own currency
with the Fund. !is gave the IMF a stock of funds which could be lent to countries facing balance of payments
di'culties. A country facing di'culty could draw upon its quota should it need to do so. A country was
automatically entitled to the first 25% of its quota, known as its gold tranche, and a further four tranches

- f 25%, known as credit tranches, which could be drawn providing the country agreed to conditions set
by the IMF which became increasingly austere with each tranche that was drawn. !us, in total, a country
could draw a maximum of 125% of its quota. !e conditions attached to the latter tranches are known as
'IMF conditionality' and generally constitute a set of measures designed to improve a country's balance of
payments. !e IMF commenced operations in March 1947 with the total sum of initial quotas available at
$8.8 billion.

When drawing upon the IMF resources, a member purchases reserve assets (usually dollars) in exchange

for further deposits of its currency. !e Fund decides what assets and currencies the drawing country receives

- n the basis of the composition of its own resources. As a rule, any borrowing from the Fund has to be repaid
- ver a period of three to five years. When repaying the Fund a country buys back its currency with foreign

reserves.

11.4 A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BRETTON WOODS SYSTEM

When the system of fixed parities commenced operation in March 1947 currencies were not freely convertible:

there were many restrictions on the amount of dollars that could be brought on the foreign exchange market

as most authorities had insu'cient reserves to meet the huge demand for dollars. In the immediate years a(er

the Second World War, the USA ran healthy current account surpluses and the European economies large

deficits. !is was partly because the Europeans did not have strong exporting capabilities and partly because

they were importing investment goods for reconstruction purposes and satisfying a pent-up consumer

demand.

254

The International Monetary System

!e setting-up of the Bretton Woods system did not provide the basis for the reconstruction of the

European countries _per se_ . One of the major problems confronting the Europeans was their lack of dollars

for purchasing the vital capital goods required to rebuild their war-torn economies. In 1948, partly out of a

desire to help the Europeans help themselves, the US Secretary of State George Marshall announced a massive

package of aid to the European economies. !e 'Marshall aid' package was a very significant contribution

to)European reconstruction and the development of the post-war world economy. Between mid-1948 and

mid-1952, Marshall aid provided some $11.6 billion of grants and $1.8 billion in loans and this greatly relieved

the problem of the dollar shortage. !e funds enabled European countries to purchase the capital and raw

materials necessary for reconstruction.

Marshall aid was made partly conditional on greater cooperation between the European economies.

One sign of this cooperation was the setting-up of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation

which)administered the Marshall aid funds; later this organization became the Organization for Economic

Co-operation and Development, with the USA and Canada joining in 1961 and Japan in 1964. Another

result of US encouragement to greater European cooperation was the European Payments Union (EPU),

which commenced operations in 1950. !e EPU enabled the European member countries to settle trade

credits among themselves with the minimal use of dollars. !is further relieved the dollar shortage

and) contributed to the faster liberalization and growth of intra-European trade as compared to extraEuropean trade.

In 1949 the European deficits led to a series of currency devaluations in the UK, France and the Scandinavian

countries, which received the approval of the IMF. !e Fund recognized that the parities that were fixed in 1944

- vervalued the European currencies and that to not allow the devaluations would require a severe de$ation in
the European economies which would be undesirable as they were seeking reconstruction. Furthermore, the
funds that the IMF had available for financing these deficits were considered to be inadequate and should not
be used to finance the reconstruction.

From the early 1950s onwards the US basic balance moved from its post-war surplus into deficits of

approximately $1.5 billion per year. !e counterpart of this was that the Europeans and Japanese started to

run surpluses. Initially the US deficits caused no worries because its trading partners, notably West Germany

and Japan, were experiencing export-led growth and were happy to build up dollar reserves. So long as the

US deficits were of reasonable proportions and US gold reserves exceeded its dollar liabilities the system

functioned well. !e operation of the EPU, the Marshall aid package and the improved health of the European

economies in the 1950s enabled the Europeans to relax their trade and capital controls. In December 1958

the Europeans had acquired su'cient reserves that they were able to make their currencies convertible and

abolish the EPU.

During the period 1958–61 there was a more rapid deterioration in the US balance of payments (see

Table 11.1). Many of the dollars acquired were converted into gold by foreign central banks, and this gold

drain provoked some concern in the US administration about the US deficit. In March 1961 there was a 5%

revaluation of the Deutschmark and the Dutch guilder. In addition, to forestall speculation against the dollar,

the USA and nine other countries arranged a General Arrangement to Borrow (GAB). !e GAB members

who became known as the group of ten (G10) agreed to lend additional funds to the IMF should one of the

members require large-scale borrowing. !e GAB arrangements were opened in October 1962 with potential

lending commitments totalling $6 billion. In the event the USA never used the facility which was not activated

until the UK used it at the end of 1964.

In 1954 the London gold bullion market reopened for private trading in gold. Around 1961, due to

speculation of a US devaluation against gold, there was persistent upward pressure on the price of gold.

Indeed, in 1962 there was such upward pressure on the gold price that the central banks of the USA and seven

- ther industrialized countries set up a 'gold pool'. !e purpose of the pool was to increase the supply of gold
- n the private market when there was an upward pressure on its price so as to keep it in line with the o'cial
price of $35 per ounce.

In 1965, President de Gaulle made a speech extolling the virtues of gold as compared to the dollar, and the

French started to convert dollars into gold with the US authorities. By mid-1967 it was becoming apparent

that with US dollar liabilities exceeding its gold reserves, any attempt by central banks to convert their dollar

reserves into gold would lead to a breakdown of the system. !is led to an agreement by central banks not to

convert their dollar reserves into gold. In addition, the authorities decided to give up their sales of gold to the

private market in a bid to prevent its price rising. A two-tier market for gold was established with the o'cial

rate remaining at $35 per ounce while the private market price was allowed to rise.

During the early 1960s the US balance of payments position stabilized but, by the mid-1960s, with US

involvement in the Vietnam War, the US balance of payments began to deteriorate more noticeably, as can be

seen in Table 11.1. !ere was a growing feeling that the dollar was overvalued in relation to other currencies.

!ings started coming to a head in 1967 when, a(er a series of current account deficits, the UK authorities

decided to devalue the pound by 14.6%. In 1969 problems with the French balance of payments and the

fall of de Gaulle led to an 11% devaluation of the franc and a 9.3% revaluation of the Deutschmark. !ese

devaluations reminded speculators that exchange rates were adjustable and that considerable profits could be

made in anticipating and selling currencies which would be devalued.

Little action was taken to reduce the size of the US balance of payments deficits which continued to rise.

By 1971 it became increasingly apparent to speculators that the dollar was overvalued and the Deutschmark

and yen were undervalued. In April 1971, the US trade balance went into deficit for the first time that century,

which led to a massive capital out$ow from the dollar in anticipation of a dollar devaluation. During May the

256

The International Monetary System

speculation against the dollar was so immense that the Bundesbank had to purchase some $2 billion in just

two days. Speculation became so intense that foreign exchange trading was halted for a week. When trading

recommenced, the Deutschmark was revalued by 7% and the Austrian schilling by 5%.

!e revaluations were not considered to be su'cient, and with the private market price of gold exceeding

the o'cial price, speculators felt that a devaluation of the dollar was inevitable. Massive speculation against the

dollar continued with speculators buying yen and Deutschmarks in anticipation of quick short-term profits

from a dollar devaluation. With continued massive speculation against the dollar, on 15 August 1971 President

Nixon o'cially announced that the dollar was no longer convertible into gold. In addition, he announced an

emergency 10% tariff on all US imports as an interim measure until US trading partners agreed to revalue

their currencies against the dollar. Nixon also announced some domestic policies designed to stabilize the US

in$ation rate, which included price and wage controls.

!e motivation behind the Nixon measures was to prompt other countries to revalue their currencies

against the dollar; the US authorities did not feel that devaluing the dollar against gold was a desirable course

- f action. One reason was that the administration believed it would be a break of faith with foreign central
banks that had been persuaded to hold dollars rather than gold. Furthermore, a devaluation of the dollar
against gold would not improve US competitiveness if other countries continued to peg against the dollar. !e
hope was that the Nixon measures would encourage other countries to revalue their currencies against the
dollar and so restore US competitiveness.

!e immediate response of foreign governments to the Nixon measures was along the lines sought by

the US administration. Foreign governments allowed their exchange rates to $oat and agreed to a further

liberalization of trade barriers. In a bid to restore the pegged exchange rate system, the G10 nations met in

December at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. !ey tried to tackle the problem of the overvalued

dollar by devaluing it against gold from $35 to $38 and revaluing currencies against the dollar by an average

- f 8%. In addition, the margin by which other currencies could $uctuate against the dollar was widened
from ±1 to ±2.25%. In return for the revaluations, the USA agreed to remove its 10% import tariff. Although
President Nixon hailed the package as ‘the most significant monetary agreement in the history of the world’
it was in tatters within 15 months. !e devaluation and increased $exibility were really a case of too little
too late, especially as in$ation rate differentials between the industrialized countries began to diverge
(see Table)11.6). !e devaluation did little to remedy the US balance of payments which reached record
proportions in 1972.

By mid-1972 the UK ran into further balance of payments di'culties, and in June the UK authorities

decided to let the pound $oat. !e worsening US deficit led to further speculation against the dollar and

in January 1973 the Swiss authorities announced that the Swiss franc was to $oat against the dollar, soon

followed in February by the Japanese decision to allow the yen to $oat despite a further 10% dollar devaluation

- n 12 February. With further speculation against the dollar at the beginning of March, the foreign exchange
markets again had to be closed and when they reopened on 19 March the European currencies began a
joint $oat against the dollar known as the ‘Snake in the Tunnel’, an arrangement which meant that many
European currencies were allowed to $uctuate by a maximum of ±1.125% against one another (the Snake)
and a maximum of ±2.25% against the dollar (the Tunnel). In June 1973 the Snake in the Tunnel became the
plain Snake in which the maximum $uctuation against the dollar was abandoned.

!e adoption of $oating exchange rates stood in marked contrast to the setting-up of the Bretton Woods

system. !ere was no general agreement to adopt $oating exchange rates or what rules should govern the

conduct of future exchange rate policies. Rather, the move to $oating rates was a somewhat disorderly and

haphazard product of the breakdown of the fixed exchange rate system.

11.5 WHY DID THE BRETTON WOODS SYSTEM BREAK DOWN?

!e Bretton Woods System operated with reasonable success and only occasional realignments from 1947

to 1971. Explanations of its breakdown generally concentrate on the problems of liquidity and the lack of an

adequate adjustment mechanism.

_The liquidity problem_

Well before the eventual demise of Bretton Woods, Robert Tri'n (1960) had predicted an eventual loss of

confidence in the system. Tri'n argued that there was an inherent contradiction in the gold–dollar standard.

For the Bretton Woods system to function successfully it was essential that confidence was maintained in

the US dollar; so long as central banks knew that dollars could be converted into gold at $35 per ounce they

would willingly hold dollars in their reserves. Tri'n pointed out that as international trade grew, so would

the demand for international reserves, namely US dollars. To meet the demand for these reserves the Bretton

Woods system depended on the US running deficits, with other countries running surpluses and purchasing

dollars to prevent their currencies appreciating. Hence, over time, the stock of US dollar liabilities to the rest

- f the world would increase and this rate of increase would be higher than the annual addition to the US gold
reserves resulting from gold-mining activities. As a result, the ratio of US dollar liabilities to gold held by the
US Federal Reserve would deteriorate until eventually the convertibility of dollars into gold at $35 per ounce
would become _de facto_ impossible.

As it became apparent that the US authorities would not be able to fulfil their convertibility commitment,

Tri'n predicted that central banks would begin to anticipate a devaluation of the dollar rate against gold. In

anticipation of this, central banks would start to convert their reserves into dollars and stop pegging their

currencies against the dollar, leading to an inevitable breakdown of the system. !e 'Tri'n dilemma' was that

continued US deficits would undermine the Bretton Woods system, yet if the US took measures to curb its

deficits this would lead to a shortage of world reserves which would undermine the growth of world trade and

exert de$ationary pressures on the world economy.

Table 11.2 shows the decline in the ratio of US reserves relative to its liquid liabilities as predicted by

Tri'n's analysis. !e Bretton Woods system worked well in the 1950s, but the confidence in the system slowly

deteriorated in the 1960s as US liquid liabilities began to outstrip its reserves; the deterioration is particularly

marked from 1968 to 1972, corresponding to the collapse of the system.

The International Monetary System

_An alternative interpretation of the demise of Bretton Woods_

Although the Tri'n dilemma at first sight seems to fit the facts quite well and is commonly held to be the

major cause of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, Jurg Niehans (1984) and Paul De Grauwe

(1989) have suggested a somewhat different interpretation of events, which is based upon an application

- f what is known as Gresham's Law. !omas Gresham (1529–79) argued that when there is a discrepancy
between the o'cial rate of exchange between two assets and their private market rate of exchange, the asset
that is undervalued at the o'cial rate will disappear from circulation, while the asset that is overvalued
will continue in circulation. When applied to the monetary field this means that 'bad money drives out
good)money'.

Gresham's Law can equally provide an insight into the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. In this case,

the two assets to be considered are gold and the dollar. Under the Bretton Woods system the o'cial rate of

**Box 11.1 The creation of special drawing rights**

Although the international monetary system was under no real strain around the mid-1960s, there

was a feeling that the growth of international reserves was inadequate. !is led to fears that the

growth of world trade and with it economic growth would be unnecessarily constrained. In addition,

the mechanism for increasing reserves was regarded as being too dependent upon the USA running

balance of payments deficits which, as Tri'n's analysis had shown, could eventually undermine the

whole system. !ese factors led to a discussion among IMF members over how to supplement the stock

  - f international reserves.

!e result of these deliberations was the First Amendment of the IMF Articles of Agreement in

1967, which empowered the Fund to create a Special Drawing Account to supplement its quota system

which operates under its General Account. Under the scheme a new reserve asset was to be created by

the Fund called the Special Drawing Right (SDR). Unlike quotas which are backed by the deposits of

Fund members, the SDR's value as a reserve asset rests on it being regarded as an acceptable means of

exchange between central banks and the Fund.

Under the SDR scheme, each member of the Fund is allocated a specified annual amount of SDRs

in proportion to their quota with the Fund. !e cumulative total holdings of SDRs allocated to a

country is known as its 'net cumulative allocation'. !e value of an SDR was originally set at 1/35th of an

  - once of gold, which was equivalent to $1. A country can draw upon its SDR allocation whenever it is
experiencing balance of payments di'culties or needs to supplement its reserves. In contrast to quota
drawings, SDR drawings do not require consultation with the Fund, do not have conditionality attached
and are not subject to repayment. Since SDR drawings are not subject to repayment they constitute a net
addition to global reserves. However, over a five-year period a member has to maintain its SDR balance
at an average of 30% of its net cumulative allocation (reduced to 15% in 1979).

A country that draws upon its SDR allocation can exchange the SDRs with foreign authorities for

their currencies, thereby increasing its reserves. All members of the Fund are obliged to accept SDRs in

exchange for their national currency up to three times its net cumulative allocation. Countries drawing

SDRs have to pay interest, while countries in receipt of SDRs receive interest.

An increase in SDR allocations requires the consent of 80% of IMF votes. !e first planned allocation

  - f SDRs for the period 1970–72 was $9.5 billion. In the event, these allocations proved very ill-timed

259

International Finance

because they coincided with a massive surge in international liquidity resulting from massive purchases

  - f dollars in the final years of the Bretton Woods system. As of February 2021, the total SDR allocation
was the equivalent of $293 billion.

In July 1976 the value of the SDR was changed from $1 to a weighted basket of 16 currencies, and in

January 1981 the SDR value was redefined as a weighted basket of five currencies, these being the US

dollar, the Deutschmark, the yen, the French franc and pound sterling. !e introduction of the euro led

to the SDR being redefined as a basket of just four currencies in January 2001. More recently, effective

October 2016, the SDR has been changed to represent five currencies with the addition of the Chinese

renminbi, the weights being: the dollar (41.73%), the euro (30.93%), Chinese renminbi (10.92%), yen

(8.33%) and pound sterling (8.09%). !e role of the SDR in the international financial system is fully

covered in Clark and Polak (2004).

exchange of these two assets was set at $35 per troy ounce. !e US authorities were committed to buy and sell

gold with foreign monetary authorities at this price. With US prices increasing by some 40% between 1959

and 1969, the price of gold should, _ceteris paribus_, have risen by a similar amount. Indeed, as we have seen

in the private market, there was a persistent upward pressure on the price of gold, leading to the setting-up

- f the gold pool. However, these gold sales became so significant that the loss of gold led central banks to
disband the gold pool in 1968. A two-tier market for gold led to the private market price of gold rising above
the o'cial rate.

Once the o'cial price of gold became undervalued compared to the private rate, central banks could

easily have caused a major run on the dollar by converting their dollar reserves into gold and then selling

it on the private market at a profit. In a bid to preserve the fixed exchange rate system, in 1967, the USA

secured an agreement from foreign central banks not to convert their dollar reserves into gold nor sell it

- n private markets. In effect, the dollar was _de facto_ no longer convertible into gold. In the end, following
a further deterioration of the US balance of payments in 1970 and 1971, President Nixon announced
the _de jure_ )suspension of dollar convertibility into gold. Dollars had driven out gold in accordance with
Gresham's Law.

_Lack of an adjustment mechanism_

!e Bretton Woods system permitted a realignment of exchange rate parities as a last resort in case of

'fundamental disequilibrium' of a member's balance of payments. In practice, however, countries proved

extremely reluctant to either devalue or revalue their currencies or undertake other economic policy measures

required to ensure sustainable balance of payments positions. !e fact that 'fundamental disequilibrium' was

not defined did not help.

!e USA could not devalue the dollar in terms of gold since this would undermine confidence in the whole

system. In addition, a dollar devaluation against gold did not improve US competitiveness if other countries

maintained their exchange rate parities against the dollar. As such, the USA was expected to pursue appropriate

de$ationary policies at home to keep the size of its balance of payments deficit under control. In practice, the

US was extremely reluctant to de$ate its economy in order to regulate its deficit. Indeed, from the mid-1960s

President Johnson financed US involvement in Vietnam and a series of domestic social programmes through

The International Monetary System

in$ationary money supply increases rather than through higher taxation. !e expansionary US monetary

policy inevitably resulted in higher US in$ation and a significant widening of its balance of payments deficits.

Other countries suffering persistent current account deficits could have resorted to devaluation. In

practice, deficit countries proved extremely reluctant to devalue their currencies because such action was

viewed as a sign of governmental and national weakness. !e sense of national crisis that accompanied the UK

Labour government's devaluation of sterling in 1967 is an example of this phenomenon. !e deficit countries

were equally reluctant to adopt de$ationary policies which might cure the deficits since most had committed

themselves to the objective of achieving full employment. With the deficit countries reluctant to adjust, it was

then necessary that surplus countries take action to reduce their surpluses.

!e surplus countries included Germany, Japan and Switzerland, but they proved as reluctant to revalue

their currencies as the deficit countries were to devalue. !is was because the undervaluation of their

currencies had enabled them to experience strong export growth and biased their economies towards the

production of tradable goods. !ey believed that to revalue their currencies would risk ending export growth

and lead to unemployment in their economies as their tradables industries would be forced to contract. In

addition, they were not prepared to re$ate their economies as a means of reducing their surpluses because

they feared the in$ationary consequences.

!e recognition that in a fixed exchange rate regime the pressure was normally on debtors to undertake

economic adjustment, because of the fall in their reserves required to defend the exchange rate, had led to

the inclusion of a 'scarce currency clause' in the IMF articles. !is permitted debtor countries to adopt penal

measures against persistent surplus countries, but it was never invoked.

With neither deficit nor surplus countries being prepared to adjust their economies or exchange rates the

question of how to maintain fixed exchange rate parities in the face of persistent imbalances in the balance

payments required an answer. In a bid to prevent exchange rate realignments, the surplus countries supplied

the deficit countries' central banks with reserves on a credit basis to enable them to prevent devaluations of

their currencies. Packages were arranged to support the Italian lira in 1964 and sterling in 1965. In retrospect,

it is clear that such packages were only delaying the day when exchange rate parities would have to be realigned

and so constituted no more than a papering over the cracks.

_The seigniorage problem_

!e pivotal role of the dollar meant that the USA was the major source of international liquidity under the

Bretton Woods system. To acquire reserves the rest of the world had to run balance of payments surpluses while

the USA ran deficits. !is meant that the rest of the world had to consume less than it was producing, while the

USA had the privilege of being able to consume more than it was producing. President Charles de Gaulle of

France argued that the system conferred an 'exorbitant privilege' on the US, which was able to gain productive

long-term assets from its overseas investments in exchange for short-term dollar liabilities. US dollar Treasury

bonds accumulated by the rest of the world yielded relatively low rates of interest and their purchasing power

was eroded by US in$ation. In effect, the USA was able to borrow at very low real rates of interest. !e

actual methodology to calculate the value of such ‘seigniorage’ benefits has been an area of controversy. !ere

was resentment on the part of some deficit countries (for example Italy) that they had to adopt de$ationary

policies to correct their balance of payments deficits, while, because of the reserve currency status of the

dollar, the USA was under no corresponding pressure to correct its deficits. !e perceived seigniorage benefits

conferred)to the USA, while not one of the major reasons for the breakdown of the Bretton Woods scheme,

did, however, when the system was under strain, weaken the resolve to save the system.

11.6 THE POST-BRETTON WOODS ERA

_The first oil shock and its aftermath_

!e return to $oating exchange rates was initially regarded by central bankers as only a temporary

development until a new monetary order could be established. In the event, any hopes of a return to fixed

parities were overtaken by events. As a result of the Arab–Israeli con$ict at the end of 1973, the Oil Petroleum

Exporting Countries (OPEC) quadrupled the price of oil which had a huge impact on the world economy

and effectively ended any hopes of restoring a fixed exchange rate system. !e huge oil price rise meant a

significant deterioration of the oil importing countries' terms of trade (average price of exports/average price

- f imports) with the OPEC countries, as shown in Table 11.3, and with it significant deficits in their current
accounts, as shown in Table 11.4.

Non-oil exporting less-developed countries (LDCs) were particularly hard hit both by the rise in the price

- f their oil imports and by the recession in the industrialized countries which reduced their export earnings.
As a result the LDCs as a group experienced massive current account deficits which rose from $8.7 billion in
1973 to $51.3 billion in 1975. In order to assist them, the IMF set up an 'oil facility' which borrowed funds
from the surplus OPEC countries for lending to the LDCs.

!e impact of the oil shock was far from uniform, as some countries were more dependent than others on

- il imports. For example, Japan as a major oil importer suffered greatly from the shock as its current account
surplus of $100m in 1973 became a deficit of $4,500 million in 1974; the UK deficit widened from $1,200
million in 1973 to $7,800 million in 1974.

Due to its differential impact and the different policy responses adopted by governments to deal with

the shock there were marked divergences in in$ation rates. Italy and Britain, both keen to avoid recessions,

adopted expansionary macroeconomic policies which, superimposed upon the in$ationary impact of the oil

shock, led to rapid in$ation and a significant worsening in their current accounts (see Tables 11.4 and 11.5);

simultaneously there was a sharp rise in unemployment, which, combined with rising in$ation (Table)11.6),

gave rise to the term 'stag$ation’. Other countries such as Germany and Japan, who were much more concerned

to control their in$ation rates, adopted tight macroeconomic policies. Apart from its effect on current account

11.7 THE JAMAICA CONFERENCE OF 1976

In November 1975 a meeting of the major industrial nations at Rambouillet agreed to amend the Articles of

Agreement of the IMF to legitimize the $oating exchange rate regime. !e details of the Second Amendment

were worked out at the IMF annual conference held at Kingston, Jamaica, in January 1976. At Kingston the

members of the Fund formally legitimized the new $oating exchange rate system. In addition to abolishing

the o'cial price of gold, the conference aimed at increasing the importance of SDRs (see Box 11.1) in

international reserves, and there was a declaration that the SDR should become the 'principal reserve asset'.

268

The International Monetary System

_The Second Amendment_

!e Second Amendment of the IMF's Articles which came into effect in April 1978 formally gave national

authorities a large degree of discretion in selecting their exchange rate arrangements. It also urged the IMF to

adopt a policy of 'firm surveillance' over its members' exchange rate policies.

Article IV of the Second Amendment defined the obligations and responsibilities of Fund members. Each

member was obliged to notify the Fund of its exchange rate arrangement, but Fund members were basically

free to do as they wished – peg to the SDR or another currency, pursue cooperative arrangements with other

members, or adopt other exchange rate arrangements of their choice! About the only thing members could

not do was to peg their currency to gold.

In addition to defining what members of the Fund could do, the amendment also defined the role of the

IMF as being to oversee the international monetary system to ensure its effective operation. In particular, the

Fund was expected to 'exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members, and … adopt

specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies'.

Member countries were obliged to supply the Fund with information necessary for surveillance and when

requested consult with it over its exchange rate policy. !e initial guidelines drawn up by the Fund were

summarized by three principles:

1. A member shall avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order

to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over

   - ther members;

2. A member should intervene in the exchange market if necessary to counter disorderly conditions

which may be characterized _inter alia_ by disruptive short-term movements in the exchange value of

its currency;

3. Members should take into account in their intervention policies the interests of other members,

including those of countries in whose currencies they intervene.

Indications of attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates include sustained one-way reserve

movements, the introduction of trade and/or capital controls, and large-scale o'cial borrowing. However,

the IMF was not empowered to penalize governments that chose to ignore its guidelines. All in all, the Second

Amendment was merely a formal recognition of the end of the Bretton Woods system.

11.8 THE SNAKE AND THE EMS

!e member countries of the European Economic Community (EEC) had long been concerned that

their large degree of trading links with one another could be threatened by exchange rate instability. !is,

coupled with the longer-term aspiration for a fully-$edged economic and monetary union between the EEC

countries, led to the setting-up of the Snake in 1972, which had a chequered history, and was replaced by

the EMS)which)commenced operations in 1979. !e operation of the Snake and EMS is dealt with more

extensively) in Chapter) 16. What is important in the scheme of international monetary relations is that

both arrangements involved a zone of exchange rate stability between the exchange rates of the European

currencies, which re$ected in large part a dissatisfaction with allowing exchange rates to be determined by

the free market.

11.9 THE SECOND OIL SHOCK

Towards the end of 1978 the Iranian revolution disrupted its oil exports which led to a further hike in OPEC

- il prices from $13 a barrel in mid-1978 to $32 a barrel in mid-1980. Although this hike was not as great as
in the case of the first oil price shock, the recession that followed in the industrialized nations was far more
pronounced. !is was mainly because, on the basis of experience from the earlier shock, governments were
keen to minimize the in$ationary consequences, and as a result authorities of the industrialized countries
adopted restrictive policy responses. !ese policies led to a rise of world interest rates and major recessions in
the years 1980–81, particularly in the USA and the UK. Nonetheless, the recessions meant that the adjustment

- f the balance of payments deficits caused by the shock was quicker than that following the first oil shock. !e
OPEC surplus in 1980 of $112 billion was turned into a deficit by 1982.

11.10 THE DAZZLING DOLLAR, 1980–85

!e period January 1980 to May 1985 witnessed a relentless and substantial appreciation of the US dollar: its

nominal effective exchange rate appreciated by around 50% and even more in real terms (see Figure 11.1).

One of the major reasons advanced for the appreciation was the divergent macroeconomic policy stances

pursued by the USA, Europe and Japan. US authorities operated a tight monetary policy but had a rather

relaxed fiscal policy, with the US budget deficit rising from $16 billion in 1979 to $204 billion in 1986. !is

stood in contrast to the tight monetary and fiscal policy operated by the Europeans. As US real interest rates

rose relative to rates in Europe, funds were attracted into the USA to finance its growing current account

deficit. !e US administration argued that the appreciation of the dollar re$ected the strength of the US

economy and that it was not a policy problem.

However, as the dollar appreciation continued it started to provoke a great deal of concern. A squeeze on

US export and import-competing industries contributed to a rapidly deteriorating balance of payments which

in turn led to persistent calls in Congress for protectionist measures to be adopted against trading partners,

especially Japan. Although the Europeans and Japanese were benefiting from increased exports to the US,

they were concerned about the mounting threat of US protectionism. !ey viewed the US budget deficit as

the principal cause of the US current account deficit, which they argued could only be remedied by policies

designed to reduce the US budget deficit. !e increasing concern about the US economy and the strength of

the dollar contributed in large part to the issuing of the Plaza Accord.

11.11 FROM PLAZA TO LOUVRE AND BEYOND

In September 1985, finance ministers and central bank governors from the so-called G5 countries (France,

West Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan) met at the Plaza Hotel, New York, and

issued a communiqué known as the Plaza Accord. !e statement said that the exchange rate of the dollar did

not accurately re$ect changes in the economic fundamentals, notably the US pledge to reduce its budget deficit

and measures to stimulate demand in Japan. A further depreciation of the dollar was considered desirable

and, importantly, there was a commitment to ‘cooperate more closely to encourage this, when to do so would

be helpful’. !is was followed by purchases of Deutschmarks and yen. !e Plaza Accord was a tangible sign of

growing dissatisfaction with $oating exchange rates. Following the Accord the dollar depreciated throughout

1986, although the extent to which it can be attributed to the Accord is a matter of conjecture, especially as the

dollar had begun to depreciate prior to the Plaza meeting. !e depreciation of the dollar was so substantial

that the concern by early 1987 switched to stemming its decline.

At a G7 meeting held at Paris in February 1987, the finance ministers issued what is known as the Louvre

Accord. !ey made it known that they felt that the dollar had depreciated far enough and that exchange

rates were 'broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals'. Furthermore, there was agreement to

'cooperate closely to foster exchange rates around current levels'. !e Accord was backed up by an unpublished

agreement between the parties that it is believed was aimed at keeping the dollar within a 5% target band

against the Deutschmark and the yen.

Exchange rates remained fairly stable following the Louvre Accord, but pressure for a further depreciation

- f the dollar led to large-scale purchases of dollars by the Japanese. !e dollar remained stable until October
1987 when, following the collapse of stock markets around the world, it came under renewed pressure. It was
feared that the reduced wealth and US plans to reduce its budget deficit would lead to a cut in expenditure that
could herald a worldwide recession as had happened following the stock market collapse in 1929. To reduce
the risk of recession there was a significant loosening of monetary policy around the world, with central banks
reducing interest rates. Only in January 1988 with signs that the US trade deficit had started to bottom-out
did the dollar begin to recover.

11.12 CURRENCY TURMOIL AND CRISES POST-1990

!e significant loosening of monetary policy following the stock market collapse of 1987 eventually led to

renewed pressure on world in$ation, which in turn required a series of interest rate rises to bring it under

control. In turn the interest rate rises led to recessions for the US and UK economies in 1991. !e early 1990s

also witnessed unprecedented currency turmoil, leading the Bank of International Settlements to state in its

1994 Annual Report that:

technology, innovation, free capital mobility and investors' desire for international portfolio

diversification have by now all combined to increase vastly the potential for shi(ing large amounts of

271

International Finance

financial capital around the world, and across currencies, at great speed … it is probably no exaggeration

to say that the period from late 1991 to early 1993 witnessed the most serious and widespread foreign

exchange market crisis since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system twenty years ago.

!e origins of the currency turmoil dated back to the collapse of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the

subsequent reunification of East and West Germany, followed by a decision to allow East German Ostmarks

to be converted into Deutschmarks at the very generous exchange rate parity of 1 Ostmark to 1 Deutschmark.

!is led to a near 30% increase in the German money supply, heightening in$ationary fears. In addition, to

pay for massive fiscal transfers to prop up an ailing East German economy, the German authorities became

major issuers of long-term bonds, pushing up German interest rates significantly. !is meant that other

countries in Europe that had currencies pegged to the Deutschmark in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)

were forced to raise their rates.

In June 1992, Danish voters narrowly rejected the Maastricht Treaty, the European legislation concerned

with creating a monetary union in Europe. !is led to the emergence of exchange rate tensions within the

ERM. !e Italian lira became particularly vulnerable to speculative attack, due to question marks over the

sustainability of its budget deficit; and the pound sterling, which had joined the system in May 1990, was

increasingly perceived as overvalued at its central parity of 2.95DM/£1. At the end of August 1992, opinion

polls indicated a possible French rejection of the Maastricht Treaty and the Italian lira fell towards its $oor

in the ERM. In early September the Italians raised their interest rates sharply to defend the lira while the UK

authorities announced a massive borrowing, equivalent to 20 billion Deutschmarks, to bolster the ability of

the Bank of England to defend sterling.

Following a speculative attack, the Finns were forced to $oat the markka on 8 September, and Swedish

interest rates were raised to defend the krona. On 14 September the Italian lira was devalued by 7% in the

face of massive speculative pressure. Encouraged by these successes, speculators turned their attention on the

pound sterling and, despite massive intervention by the Bank of England and a 5% rise in interest rates in a

single day, the UK authorities were forced to suspend sterling's membership of the ERM on 16 September.

On 17 September further speculation against the Italian lira led to its suspension from the ERM and a

devaluation of the Spanish peseta by 5%. !e French franc, Danish krone and Irish punt were successfully

defended, and following a joint statement by the French and German authorities that 'no change in the

central rate is justified', several weeks of calm returned. However, on 19 November the Swedish authorities

were forced to abandon the krona peg to the European Currency Unit (ECU). !is in turn led to speculative

attacks against the Portuguese escudo and Spanish peseta which were both devalued by 6% on 22 November.

Speculative pressures continued, and on 10 December the Norwegian authorities ended their peg to the ECU.

However, speculative attacks against the French franc were successfully resisted by a combination of French

interest rate rises combined with a cut in German interest rates and strong support by the German and French

authorities for the franc–Deutschmark parity.

!e Irish punt was finally devalued by 10% on 30 January 1993, and in May 1993 further speculation

led to devaluations of the escudo by 6.5% and the Spanish peseta by 8%. Further speculative attacks were

mounted against the French franc, reaching unprecedented levels when, on 29 July, Germany failed to reduce

its key discount rate despite market expectations of a 50 basis point cut. !is led to massive selling of most

ERM currencies against the Deutschmark on 30 July, which le( five currencies at the bottom of their ERM

band. Over the weekend of 31 July and 1 August, central bank governors met and decided that the only way

to save the system from complete collapse was to widen the bands in the ERM from ±2.25% to a much wider

±15%. !e last-minute widening reduced speculative pressures within the system and monetary tensions

eased, allowing German and French interest rates to fall. !e year 1993 witnessed a spectacular bull market

272

The International Monetary System

for bonds and equities, which came to an abrupt end in 1994 when the dollar hit new lows against the yen

and the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates.

_The Mexican 'tequila crisis' of 1994–95_

At the end of 1991 the Mexican government announced a change in its exchange rate such that the Mexican

peso's permissible band of $uctuation against the US dollar was widened. Despite this, the peso remained very

strong against the US dollar, trading for much of the period 1992/93 at its appreciation limit against the dollar.

!e strength of the peso was due to the Mexican government having privatized and deregulated its banking

system, combined with opening-up its capital account, the perceived success of the Brady Plan in restructuring

Mexico’s debt, and Mexico joining the North American Free Trade Area in 1993. However, starting in early

1994 things changed: there was civil unrest with an armed rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas in January

1994, the assassination of the ruling party’s presidential candidate ahead of a presidential election, and a

perceived increase in the risk of devaluation, in part because the previous appreciation of the peso had led

to a very large current account deficit of 8% of GDP. In addition to the internal factors, rises in US interest

rates started a reversal of the capital in$ows Mexico had been experiencing. !ere was a significant fall in the

foreign exchange reserves of the central bank throughout the year as foreign exchange market participants and

local residents began to anticipate a devaluation. !e speculative attack reached fever pitch a(er the election of

a new president at the start of December, and by mid-December the foreign exchange reserves were virtually

wiped out. On 20 December the Mexican government announced a devaluation of the peso from 3.50 to 4.025

pesos per dollar, some 15% below its previously announced lower limit. !is set off a further speculative attack

against the peso such that it was forced to $oat, which then led to panic on the part of foreign investors and

the peso fell dramatically to 7 pesos per dollar by March 1995 and to 7.7 pesos per dollar by the end of 1995.

!e crisis put the economy on the brink of default on its external debt; fear of this and the possible

implications led the US Treasury, in conjunction with the IMF, to arrange an emergency $48 billion rescue

package. !e rescue package meant that the country avoided an economic catastrophe, but nonetheless rises

in interest rates and fiscal cutbacks meant that output fell by 6.6% in 1995, unemployment doubled, and

in$ation rose from 6.9% in 1994 to 35% in 1995. !e Mexican crisis not only adversely affected the Mexican

economy, but also led to significant falls in many other developing countries' stock markets and currencies,

and this process of contagion from the Mexican markets to other developing countries gave rise to the socalled 'tequila effect'. Fortunately, the economic crisis was relatively short-lived and in 1996 the Mexican

economy rebounded strongly.

_The 1997–98 Asian crisis_

Another period of almost unprecedented financial turmoil began on 2 July 1997, following the devaluation

- f the !ai baht. !e Asian economies had during the 1990s been viewed as highly successful fast-growing
economies, and they were extremely successful in attracting international capital in$ows. Terms like the
‘Asian miracle’ had become part of the international lexicon. However, the international capital in$ows
had contributed to property and stock market bubbles in many of the economies and the fast growth had
disguised structural $aws in their financial systems. When the bubbles began to burst there was a rush on the
part of international investors to exit the region and the capital in$ows abruptly became substantial capital

- ut$ows. !e result was a large fall in property values, stock market indices and in the value of many of the
currencies. !e turmoil went on from July 1997 through to the end of 1998, by which time the stock markets
and currencies had begun to recover. !e Asian crisis is more comprehensively covered in Chapter 17.

273

International Finance

_The 1998 Russian crisis_

Although the Russian economy weathered the Asian financial crisis quite well, it was nonetheless extremely

weak. !e government was running a large fiscal deficit which was financed partly by rouble debt but also

in large part by issuing debts in US dollars with an ever-rising rate of interest. By July 1998, the Russian

government was having increasing trouble financing its fiscal deficits as foreign investors became increasingly

worried about the prospects for repayment. Concern about the fate of the Russian economy led to an agreement

between Russia and the IMF for a loan of $23 billion. However, a(er an initial tranche of the loan of $5 billion

was made, the Russian government decided to renege on the conditions attached to the loan. !e rouble, which

had been pegged to the US dollar, started to come under severe speculative attack; in particular, many wealthy

Russians, anticipating a devaluation, sold domestic assets such as shares and bonds, leading to a collapse in

their prices and sold the roubles raised to acquire US dollars. In a bid to salvage the situation, on 17)August

1998 Russia unilaterally announced a restructuring of its rouble-denominated debt and a moratorium on its

foreign debt obligations, combined with a $oating of the rouble. !e Russian restructuring effectively wiped

- ut most of its rouble-denominated debt and caused panic on the part of international investors about the
implications of the moratorium for foreign debt repayment. A Russian request for the next instalment on
its loan was turned down by the IMF since the government had reneged on its promised fiscal reforms. !e
refusal of the IMF came as a major shock to foreign holders of Russian debt that had assumed that Russia was
'too important to fail' and would be bailed out because of its political and strategic importance. !e result of
the effective Russian default led international investors to reassess the risks of investing in emerging markets
more generally, and there were significant declines in both emerging and global stock markets. !is was
particularly the case because the Russian crisis coincided with the collapse of the investment fund Long-Term
Capital Management on 23 September 1998 (see below).

_The 1999 Brazilian crisis_

!e Russian crisis had a direct impact on Brazil. Similarities between Russia and Brazil had been noted by

speculators, in particular, like Russia, it had huge public-sector deficits combined with a large external debt.

Following the Russian default, the Brazilian real had been under increasing speculative attack and in a bid

to forestall a crisis the IMF arranged a $40 billion loan in December 1998. !e aim of the emergency loan

was to calm investors’ fears and give Brazil time to implement a fiscal reform package. However, speculators

remained unconvinced and speculative pressures continued until, in January 1999, the Brazilian government

announced an 8% devaluation of the real. !e devaluation, however, proved insu'cient and the real was

forced to $oat before quickly falling some 40% against the US dollar. !e Brazilian economy moved into a

sharp recession with output falling some 6.1% in 1999. While the economy did make some recovery in 2000

and 2001, it was adversely affected by the Argentinian crisis of 2001–02 with output falling 8.9% in 2002 and

7.6% in 2003.

_The Long-Term Capital Management crisis_

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a hedge fund founded in 1994 which had two Nobel prizewinners in economics among its partners, Myron Scholes and Merton Miller. !e fund took what were

regarded as low-risk speculative positions in government and corporate bonds, based on interest rate spreads.

It took speculative positions when interest rate spreads in the markets were unusually high, predicting that

they would fall. !e trouble was that its positions were highly leveraged, and on a capital base of some $5)billion

274

The International Monetary System

it had positions in the markets totalling around $1.3 trillion and loans totalling over $200 billion. When the

Russians announced a default on their debt this had the effect of widening the interest rate spreads in the

financial markets causing a '$ight to quality’ in international financial markets. !e result was that LTCM’s

capital base was quickly eroded, and once word got out in the markets that it was in trouble, its positions

worsened even further. !e Federal Reserve, concerned that a failure of LTCM could create a global financial

panic, organized a rescue involving a consortium of 14 American and European financial institutions that

themselves would have been in trouble if LTCM was forced to liquidate its positions at the then prevailing

market prices. !ey agreed to inject some $4 billion of capital in return for effective control of the hedge

fund. !is injection meant LTCM was able to liquidate its positions in a controlled manner, and although the

announcement of the rescue package itself frightened the financial markets, a global financial disaster was

averted. Nonetheless, there were severe falls in stock markets and corporate bond markets for quite some time

due to a combination of the Russian crisis and LTCM's problems.

_The Turkish crisis of 2001_

!e start of the new century did not lead to an ending of the currency turmoil. !e Turkish economy and

its macroeconomic management had been a problem for many decades and it has resorted to IMF loan

packages on many occasions. In January 2000, Turkey arranged a further $8 billion loan from the IMF and

committed itself to major economic reform and the lowering of its in$ation rate (then standing at close to

100% per annum). !e economic reform package included restructuring of its banking system and improving

its regulation, a privatization programme, a cut in subsidies and a reduction in its fiscal deficit. In addition, in

a bid to bring down its in$ation rate it adopted a crawling peg arrangement for its currency against a basket

- f the euro and US dollar. !e loan and adoption of the new programme was initially well received and
there were large capital in$ows into the country with strong economic growth. However, by November there
were signs of problems: the fiscal deficit remained large and the current account deficit had widened to 5%

- f GDP and foreign investors began to worry about the possibility of a devaluation. Fears were heightened
in December following the arrests of some well-known bankers. Overnight interest rates were raised to an
annualized 800% in early January 2001 in a bid to reduce the speculative pressures, and a new IMF loan of $7.5
billion was announced. While this brought a transitory calm, political infighting between the president and
the prime minister over the pace and scale of economic reforms led to a further speculative attack against the
Turkish lira in February 2001. Despite a further huge rise in overnight interest rates to as high as an annualized
4,000% on 21 February, and large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market, the speculative attack
proved successful and on 22 February the authorities gave up the lira peg and announced a move to a $oating
exchange rate. Within two days the lira fell from 687,200 to 900,000 per dollar, then to 1,300,000 by 11 April
2001 and 1,600,000 by 30 October 2001. !e country went into a major recession and by May 2001 found itself
arranging yet another loan from the IMF.

_The Argentinian default of 2002_

In 1991 Argentina commenced a currency board arrangement (see Box 11.2) that pegged the peso to the US

dollar at one peso per US dollar. !e arrangement initially seemed to work quite well. Argentina experienced

strong economic growth and was successful in bringing down its in$ation rate from over 100% in 1991 to

below 1% in the years 1996 to 1998 inclusive. While the currency board arrangement was extremely successful

in helping bring down Argentina’s in$ation rate, it also meant that the peso itself was one-for-one linked to

movements of the US dollar against other currencies. !e Brazilian devaluation of 1999 had already meant

275

International Finance

a recession in the Argentinian economy, but the strength of the US dollar during 1999 and 2001 meant that

Argentina became increasingly uncompetitive, as re$ected in real GDP falls of 3.4% in 1999, 0.8% in 2000

and 4.4% in 2001, and large current account deficits. By the end of 2001 its real trade-weighted exchange rate

was some 20% above its level in 1991. In addition, the recession contributed to a worsening of the country’s

fiscal position. Following the election of a new government in 1999 there were increasing concerns about

the sustainability of the peso–dollar parity, and during 2001 interest rates began to rise. In a bid to stop the

pressure on the peso the government reached an agreement with the IMF for a $14 billion loan. However, the

respite was short-lived as the country failed to reduce its fiscal deficits. Domestic residents increasingly began

to question the sustainability of the peg and attempted to withdraw pesos so that they could convert them

into dollars. In a bid to stop deposit withdrawals the government temporarily closed the banks in November

and announced heavy restrictions on withdrawals when they reopened. All this just increased the speculative

pressures on the peso, and in late December the government announced a default on its foreign debts. In

January 2002 the peso was devalued to 1.40 pesos per dollar, but speculative pressures continued and the

peso was forced to $oat and quickly fell to 4 pesos per dollar. In 2002 there was a severe fall in GDP of 10.9%

and a steep rise in unemployment. Despite an economic recovery in 2003 and 2004, in 2005 the Argentinian

government took a tough stance in negotiations with its creditors affected by its debt default, offering them

roughly 30 cents on the dollar on the defaulted debt.

**Box 11.2 'Hard pegs': currency boards versus dollarization**

As we shall see in section 11.13, some economists feel that with today's highly mobile capital any

country that has a merely 'fixed but adjustable exchange rate' regime will be vulnerable to periodic

speculative attacks. !e choice of exchange rate regime for a developing or emerging market economy

is either to allow the exchange rate to $oat freely or to opt for a 'hard peg' of a currency board, or even

more strongly give up its currency altogether and adopt a foreign currency – a process referred to as

'dollarization'. !e two regimes have become much more relevant in recent years: Argentina enacted a

currency board arrangement in 1991, Hong Kong has had a currency board arrangement since 1983,

and Estonia and Lithuania, who have had no track record of monetary policy management, established

currency boards in 1992 and 1994 respectively following the break-up of the Soviet Union, followed by

Bulgaria (1997) and Bosnia (1998). In the cases of Estonia and Lithuania the currency boards are now

based on parities against the euro. Other countries have gone further and given up their own money and

adopted the US dollar as their local currency, such as Panama, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. In

September 2000 Ecuador dollarized its economy, followed by El Salvador at the beginning of 2001, so

ending its fixed exchange rate between the colón and the dollar. Indeed, in crisis-prone countries such

as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and even Russia and Indonesia there have been debates about adopting the

US dollar as their currency.

Under a currency board arrangement the local currency is fixed to a foreign currency (say the

US dollar) at a given parity (one-for-one in the case of the peso and 7.74 Hong Kong dollars per US

dollar in the case of Hong Kong), with the local currency 100% backed by central bank holdings of the

foreign currency. !e central bank can only increase the domestic money supply if it has an equivalent

increase in its holdings of foreign currency assets. !e central bank is forbidden to hold domestic

currency-denominated assets and is unable therefore to monetarize any fiscal deficits by purchasing

local government bonds. !e central bank in effect becomes a 'vending machine' exchanging at the

276

The International Monetary System

announced parity of the local currency for the US dollar whenever required by economic agents. !e

primary aim of a currency board is to instil confidence in the local currency by providing an anchor for

in$ation expectations, since private agents know that the central bank is forbidden to monetarize fiscal

deficits or print excessive amounts of money. It is also hoped that the government will be forced to be

disciplined in the conduct of its fiscal policy since it knows that it will not be able to 'borrow' by selling

bonds to the central bank. A currency board should help to regulate the country's balance of payments

position; if the country is running a combined current and capital account in surplus, then the foreign

exchange reserves of the central bank will increase, enabling it to expand the money supply which will

in time reduce the surplus. Conversely, if the combined current and capital account are in deficit, then

the foreign exchange reserves of the central bank will fall, reducing the money supply, which will in

time reduce the deficit. Finally, the system should prove resilient to speculative attacks since the central

bank cannot run out of reserves as the domestic money supply is fully backed by central bank holdings

- f the domestic currency.

!ere are, however, some problems with a currency board arrangement. Since a currency board

cannot acquire domestic securities it is unable to lend to domestic banks in times of financial crisis.

!is was clearly shown in the case of Argentina when the public attempted to withdraw deposits from

the banking system and the central bank was not in a position to provide the banks with the necessary

liquidity, meaning that the banks were closed and restrictions had to be placed on deposit withdrawals.

Also, by ruling out the possibility of a surprise devaluation or the ability to finance larger fiscal deficits,

the central bank is in no position to help the economy out of recession. Furthermore, as the case of

Argentina showed, if the dollar appreciates strongly then this will undermine the competitiveness of the

local economy, especially if other regional competitors have devalued their currencies. A final problem

with a currency board arrangement is that it may be di'cult to convince financial markets and private

agents that the situation will never be reversed and that the peg will not be changed. !is was clearly the

case in Argentina: when both financial markets and local residents foresaw an end to the peg there was

a steep rise in interest rates to compensate for the risk of devaluation and a rush to withdraw deposits

and a large-scale capital $ight into US dollars.

Given that a currency board may not be a su'ciently hard regime in convincing financial markets

and economic agents that the peg will not be ended, some have argued in favour of dollarization, which

means withdrawing the local currency from circulation. Dollarization is seen as having a key advantage

- ver a currency board system in that, by ending the risk of a devaluation, it will ensure the country is
not subjected to a speculative attack such as that which ended the Argentinian board and which caused
enormous problems for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority during the Asian crisis. By ending the risk

- f a devaluation, local interest rates will no longer contain a devaluation premium. Another advantage
is that there are savings in administrative and transaction costs of having to convert the local currency
into dollars for trade and financial purposes. However, even complete dollarization is not without its
problems. Firstly, under a currency board the government holds dollar bills and bonds which earn it a
rate of interest from the US Treasury; if it moves from a currency board to dollarization, it sells the US
bonds it holds as foreign exchange reserves and uses the dollars raised to replace the local currency. It
therefore forgoes the rate of interest held on US dollar bonds and hands over the seigniorage benefit of
issuing its own currency to the US government. Another problem which it shares with a currency board
is that, by giving up its monetary autonomy, the US Federal Reserve sets its monetary policy and interest
rates according to economic conditions in the United States, hence a dollarized economy faces the risk

277

International Finance

  - f rising interest rates when its economy may be in recession. Another problem is that, although the risk
  - f devaluation may be reduced, since government debt will subsequently be issued in dollars, which the
local government can no longer print, then the country will still be subject to a possible financial crisis
and rising interest rates on its debt should economic agents fear out-of-control public finances and a
risk of default. Also, should the economy be hit by a major economic shock requiring a devaluation of
its currency, then by being dollarized it will not have available to it the depreciation/devaluation option.
Finally, the country's international competitiveness will be subject to the vagaries of the ups and downs

  - f the US dollar. !ose interested in exploring this issue further are advised to read Altig and Humpage
(1999) and Berg and Borenstein (2000) while Strezewksi (2020) has an up-to-date bibliography on the
literature concerning currency boards.

Unlike many of the other crises, the Argentinian crisis had been largely foreseen by foreign investors

and banks that had accordingly reduced their exposure to the country, and so it was mostly domestic banks

that incurred large losses due to a mismatch between their dollar liabilities and dollar assets, and a number

- f banks were closed. Although there was no initial impact on other countries in the region, the Uruguay
economy was adversely affected by the loss of Argentinian tourism and business, and repatriation of funds
by Argentinian residents from Uruguayan accounts, and in June, following a large fall in its foreign exchange
reserves, the Uruguay government announced that its peso would $oat and within two weeks its currency
fell by 50%. A run on bank deposits in Uruguay by nervous investors (who had probably learnt from the
Argentinian experience) led to a four-day closure of its banks, which were reopened only when an emergency
loan had been arranged with the United States. Brazil also got temporarily caught up in the fallout from the
Argentinian default, and in July 2002 foreign investors concerned about its external debt pulled funds out

- f the country and the real fell by some 20%. A crisis was averted and the real was stabilized when the IMF
arranged an additional $30 billion loan package.

_Dollar turbulence_

!e dollar itself has not been immune to currency turbulence: between January and mid-April 1995 it

depreciated from 100 yen/$1 to a mere 80 yen/$1. However, during August and September 1995 the dollar

depreciation was reversed, in part due to intervention by the central banks of Germany, Japan and the USA.

!e subsequent reversal in the dollar's fortunes was re$ected by the fact that in October 1997 it was trading

at 120 yen/$1. However, therea(er it resumed its downward trend and the credit crunch has meant a further

weakening, which was trading back below 80 yen/$1 during 2012. !e moves of the US dollar against the

Japanese yen are shown in Figure 11.2.

11.13 THE EFFECTS OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH

!e credit crunch started in the financial markets in early 2007 and has necessitated an unprecedented amount

- f intervention to prop up the financial system, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom,
but also in various European economies. !ere have been major currency swings throughout the financial
crisis, for example the yen was trading at 170 yen to the euro in August 2007 but in 2012 was trading below

the interbank lending market and markets in structured finance), the foreign exchange market continued to
trade effectively in large volumes throughout the crisis. One problem throughout the crisis has been that most
countries have implicitly sought to weaken their currencies as a means of supporting their export and import
competing industries through measures such as quantitative easing. !is led to a debate about 'currency wars'
in which each country tries to depreciate its currency. Of course, if the US Federal Reserve tries to weaken
the dollar against the pound, while the Bank of England also tries to weaken the pound against the dollar,
then the two central banks are pursuing con$icting objectives and the result may be very little change in the
dollar–pound parity. !e attempts by the Federal Reserve to weaken the dollar through quantitative easing
have also alarmed central banks and policy-makers in countries such as Brazil and China that have invested
heavily in US dollar Treasury bonds as part of their foreign exchange reserves. A more detailed coverage of
the credit crunch is contained in Chapter 18.

11.14 THE EFFECTS OF THE EUROZONE CRISIS

!e creation of the euro on 1 January 1999 with 11 founding members and the addition of six other countries

by 1 January 2011 stands out as one of the major achievements of the European Union. Initially the euro was

viewed as a potential threat to the US dollar as a reserve currency. It was also believed that by being a sound

low in$ation currency the euro would be of significant benefit to countries such as Greece and Italy which

had traditionally been high in$ation and weak currency countries. However, the onset of the credit crunch

pushed countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain into severe economic contractions which exposed

the fragility of their public finances. !e state of these finances became so bad that three of the economies,

namely Ireland, Portugal and Greece, had to be bailed out during 2010 to 2012 with hastily arranged eurozone

loans and IMF funds. !e perceived risk of countries exiting the eurozone and sovereign defaults led investors

to $ee sovereign debts of the so-called PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) for the comparative

safety of German bonds. !e result was a dramatic widening in the interest spread between PIIGS bond yields

and German bond yields. A fuller discussion of issues raised by the eurozone crisis is to be found in Chapter 16.

11.15 THE EFFECTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS

In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic due to an outbreak of a highly

transmissible virus which became known as Covid-19. !e virus was highly transmissible between humans and

highly dangerous for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Governments around the world

responded with a series of economic lockdowns to try to stop the virus spreading and overwhelming their health

systems. It also led to a vigorous policy response by central banks in the way of large-scale quantitative easing

programmes and running huge fiscal deficit to offset some of the loss of economic activity. !e international

monetary system coped remarkably well with the shock given, without any major swings between the major

currencies or loss of confidence in the system. However, only time will tell if the large rises in fiscal deficits

and national debts especially in the United States resulting from the crisis undermine the dominance and

confidence of the US dollar and lead to a greater role for currencies such as the Chinese renminbi and euro.

**Box 11.3 Bitcoin, a virtual currency not issued by a central bank or needing**
**an intermediary**

!e history of money goes back a long time: the first recorded coin use was around 700 BC in Greece

and notes were used for the first time in China around AD 1100. Over time, various things have served

as money, particularly with regard to its function as a medium of exchange, including cowry shells,

beads and even cigarettes in prisoner of war camps. One of the most interesting innovations with

respect to money of recent times has been the creation of the virtual currency Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital

currency invented by Satashi Nakamoto (a figure who remains unidentified), who introduced the idea

in late October 2008 in a paper entitled 'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System' and released

the digital coin as open source so(ware in 2009. !e real genius is that bitcoins are a virtual currency

transferable from one holder to another anonymously without the need for a financial intermediary,

such as a bank or credit card company, to verify the transaction or be involved.

Bitcoins are created as a reward along with transaction fees for computer mining activity using bitcoin

so(ware by computers that verify transactions in the so-called 'blockchain' which is a public ledger of

bitcoin transactions. Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete and unalterable by repeatedly

verifying and collecting newly broadcast transactions into a new group of transactions called a _block_,

with each block containing a cryptographic hash (which includes a timestamp of the transaction) of the

previous block. Bitcoins (and fractions as little as one millionth of a bitcoin) can be transferred from

  - ne person to another if an owner digitally signs a transaction using a private key. Without knowledge
  - f the private key, a transaction cannot be signed and a bitcoin spent or transferred; the network verifies
the transaction using a public key. Bitcoins are stored in a _wallet_ which stores the information necessary
to transact bitcoins. Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography, in which two cryptographic keys, one public
and one private, are generated – a wallet is basically a collection of these keys.

!e creation of new bitcoins has slowed over time and only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created

which is likely to be achieved around 2140. !e main advantage of bitcoin transactions is that they can

be transferred from one person to another including across national borders anonymously, speedily

and at very low cost. Bitcoins can be held anonymously and be bought both online and o%ine with real

world currencies like the dollar, pound and euro at prevailing exchange rates which can change quite

rapidly. Because of the anonymity feature, bitcoins have been used in part for illegal transactions such

new closing all time high $19,166 on 17 December. !e price of bitcoin then collapsed to $2,195 on

15)December 2018 before making a spectacular run up in 2020 and a new peak of $57,129 recorded on

21 February 2021.

!e price of bitcoins is affected by many things but over time they have become increasingly

expensive to mine as more computing power and electricity is required to successfully mine the coins.

!ere have also been many instances when bitcoin exchanges have been hacked which have severely

impacted bitcoin prices. For instance, in February 2014 Mt Gox, a Japanese-based bitcoin exchange,

was hacked with holders at the exchange losing virtually all their coins to the value of $661 million. In

August 2016 Hong Kong-based Bitfinex was hacked with $72 million of bitcoins stolen, with bitcoin

  - wners at the exchange losing an average 36% of their bitcoins. According to cryptosec.info as of end
February 2021 there had been 49 cases of security hacks on various exchanges with a total of $2.1 billion
worth of crypto currencies stolen.

!e legal status of bitcoins varies greatly between countries with its usage outlawed in some countries

such as Russia, Bolivia and Ecuador while interestingly the US, UK and Japan have permitted bitcoin

usage as it accords with promoting financial innovation. !ere are other competitors' virtual currencies

in existence, the most prominent being Ethereum, Ripple and the so-called 'stable coin' Tether which

is used by a lot of exchanges and is pegged to the US dollar at a parity of 1 Tether equal to $1, but there

are persistent concerns that Tethers are not actually backed by real US dollars. At the time of writing

Bitcoin had the best supporting ecosystem and was the most successful at attracting venture capitalists,

individuals and some institutions to invest in bitcoins and its associated blockchain technology. In a

way Bitcoin has emerged as a sort of global currency but it lacks legal tender status and there have also

been increased concerns about the energy being consumed trying to mine for bitcoins and other crypto

currencies. In the future it is likely that many central banks will launch their own digital coins and it will

be interesting to see if these adversely affect the private sectors' digital coins.

11.16 THE PRESENT EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM

!e present exchange rate system permits countries to adopt whatever exchange rate policy they wish,

providing that they do not peg their currencies to the value of gold. In practice, there exists a wide range of

exchange rate policies from completely free-$oating to various pegging arrangements, including currency

boards. Table 11.9 shows the exchange rate arrangements of Fund members as of 30 June 2019.

11.17 THE BIPOLAR VIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM: WHICH

EXCHANGE RATE REGIME IS BEST?

Following the series of exchange rate crises, particularly the speculative attacks on the ERM countries in the

early 1990s and on Mexico in 1994–95, a number of well-known academics suggested that there was no room

for a halfway house in a world of high capital mobility and that there was little scope for currencies to be in a

pegged but adjustable arrangement. !e international monetary system would increasingly become a bipolar

world where countries either opted for a 'hard peg', such as a currency board or a monetary union at one

extreme, or to be fully $oating at the other extreme. For example, Eichengreen (1994, pp. 4–5) argued that

countries ‘will be forced to choose between $oating exchange rates on the one hand and monetary)unification

282

The International Monetary System

- n the other'. Similarly, Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995, p. 74) argued that, for countries with an open capital
account, 'there is little, if any, comfortable middle ground between $oating rates and the adoption of a common
currency’. Summers (2000, p. 8) argues that, for economies with access to international capital markets, ‘the
choice of appropriate exchange rate regime … increasingly means a move away from the middle ground of
pegged but adjustable fixed exchange rates towards the two corner regimes’. Finally, Fischer (2001, p. 22),
looking at the IMF classification of exchange rate arrangements, argues that ‘in the last decade, there has been
a hollowing out of the middle of the distribution of exchange rate regimes in a bipolar direction, with the
share of both hard pegs and $oating gaining at the expense of so( pegs'. Nonetheless, the bipolar view of the
international monetary system has been recently challenged on an empirical basis by Rogoff et al. (2003), who,
following an extensive empirical study of the issue, find no support for the popular bipolar view that countries
will tend over time to move to the polar extremes of free $oat or rigid peg. Rather, intermediate regimes
have shown remarkable durability. !e analysis suggests that, as economies mature, the value of exchange
rate $exibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed

- r relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-in$ation credibility gain without compromising growth
- bjectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be)considerable benefits to
more $exible regimes. For developed countries that are not in a currency union, relatively $exible exchange
rate regimes appear to offer higher growth without any cost in credibility (ibid., p. 1).

An interesting point made in the Rogoff et al. study is that fixed or relatively rigid exchange rate systems

do not seem to cause particular harm to the economic growth rates of developing economies with limited

financial market development. Indeed, they can provide a useful anchor for gaining anti-in$ation credibility,

provided the country pursues a reasonable monetary policy. However, as the country develops economically

and institutionally to become an emerging market economy, there are ‘considerable’ gains to be had from

adopting a more $exible exchange rate regime; while for developed countries that are not part of a currency

union, $exible exchange rates seem to promote higher growth without loss of in$ation credibility provided

they are accompanied by an appropriate institutional framework such as an independent central bank.

An important point made by Rogoff et al. (2003) and Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003) is that it is

important to distinguish between the _de jure_ exchange rate regime of a country and its _de facto_ regime.

Many developing countries that claim to be free-$oating in fact intervene quite extensively in the foreign

exchange market. Indeed, this is also true of some developed nations such as Japan – although the yen was

supposed to be $oating during the period 2001 to 2004, it is estimated that the Bank of Japan purchased

around 700)billion)US dollars in the foreign exchange market. Rogoff et al. show that while $oating exchange

rates using the _de jure_ classification have become more commonplace, it is not true if one uses a _de facto_

classification system.

One, of course, has to be quite careful in interpreting the results of economic performance under different

exchange rate regimes. For example, the Argentinian peso was classified as a hard-peg currency following

its adoption of a currency board vis-à-vis the US dollar, but of course the peso freely $oated against other

currencies with which it traded (and which were not pegged to the dollar) since the US dollar is a freely

$oating currency. In addition, when the peso peg was ended in 2002, it coincided with a major recession in

the country that it would be unfair to attribute to its $oating. In Europe in the early 1980s, although many

currencies were classified as belonging to the fixed exchange rate system of the EMS, there were such frequent

realignments for some currencies, such as the Italian lira and French franc, that they might as well have been

classified as managed $oating. An attempt to adopt a more useful _de facto_ exchange rate regime classification

is made in Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) who, using five-year time horizons, distinguish between five coarse

types of exchange rate regime: fixed, limited $exibility, managed $oating, freely $oating and freely falling. Far

from finding a move to a bipolar world, Rogoff et al. (2003), looking at the period 1973–99, found that only

20% of regimes were pure $oats, 60% were intermediate or pegged regimes, and 20% were freely falling. !ey

argue that the _de jure_ classification system substantially overstates the existence of freely $oating or hard-peg

currencies compared to reality (2003, p. 13):

While _de jure_ intermediate regimes rose from around 10 percent of all exchange rate regimes in the

mid-1970s to about a quarter in the late 1990s, the proportion of _de facto_ regimes with an intermediate

degree of $exibility has remained at about one half since the mid-1970s. Within intermediate regimes,

however, managed $oats have become more prevalent in emerging markets over the past decade, while

  - ther developing countries have tended to move in the opposite direction toward more limited $exibility.

While some countries like Argentina and Malaysia moved to hard pegs in the 1990s, and others such as

Indonesia, Korea and South Africa moved to $oating, there were many other countries that moved away from

the bipolar view (using the _de facto_ system) to intermediate regimes, such as Brazil, Peru, Poland, Russia and

Venezuela.

!e question of which regime is best for economic performance remains a controversial and unresolved

issue. Ghosh et al. (2003) find that in$ation is significantly lower under fixed exchange rate regimes than in

intermediate or freely $oating ones, in part due to a credibility effect and in part due to a discipline effect.

number of regime years. Each crisis is counted only once and hence, if it persists over multiple years, the subsequent years are not taken

into account in the calculation. Additionally, the years an exchange rate regime transition takes place (i.e. the year preceding, the year

during, and the year following the transition) are excluded from the computation. A crisis is considered as having occurred when the

weighted average of one-month changes in the exchange rate and reserves is more than three (country-specific) standard deviations

above the country average. (b) Since the samples include many countries some of which exhibit very high volatility of growth, such as

transition economies, countries facing war etc., it may be more appropriate to look at median values rather than mean values. !e median

_Source_ : Rogoff et al. (2003), various tables.

However, they do not find evidence of a link between the choice of exchange rate regime and economic

growth. By contrast, Levy-Yeyati and Strurzenegger (2003) find evidence that $exible exchange rates seem

to be associated with higher growth in developing countries and emerging market economies, although no

such link is found for developed industrial countries. Indeed, they find (2003, p. 1178) that on aggregate,

‘fixers grow on average 0.78% less than $oaters. !is suggests that, everything else equal, a country that

systematically opted to $oat its exchange rate a(er the demise of Bretton Woods would have ended up in

2000 with an output 22% larger than one that chose to fix'. Both papers also find some evidence that fixed

exchange rate regimes seem to be associated with higher output volatility. Rogoff et al. (2003), using a sample

- f 158)countries for the period 1970–99, examine _de facto_ exchange rate regimes against four criteria: in$ation,
economic growth,)variability of growth and the occurrence of crises. A summary of their aggregate results is
reported in Table 11.10.

A look at the aggregate figures seems to suggest that on the in$ation rate score freely $oating countries do

quite well, but this excludes countries whose currencies are freely falling (in$ation rates over 40%) which are

normally classified as $oating currencies. On economic growth there is relatively little difference between the

first four regimes, with a slightly better performance of fixed or limited $exibility regimes, though this may

be at the cost of greater variability of output compared to $oating. Finally, the probability of a crisis does not

appear to differ greatly between regimes, although limited $exibility does not fare very well. In the latter case,

however, one has to be careful because the aggregate figures are a combination of advanced, emerging and

developing countries and hide quite big variations between these groups. In particular, Rogoff et al. (2003)

find that emerging market economies are far less exposed to risk of a banking and/or balance of payments

crisis when they have a $oating exchange rate regime than when they have a fixed one. For example, they have

a 7.7% probability of a twin crisis of balance of payments (currency) and banking with a peg, and only 1.8%

probability with limited $exibility. !is latter fact may be particularly pertinent to the choice of exchange rate

regime for an emerging market economy, since Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) argue that twin crises have

287

International Finance

particularly high costs. In such economies, such crises usually commence with the onset of domestic financial

distress, which accelerates when a currency crisis then also sets in, leading to a 'vicious cycle'. !e costs of such

crises are high both in terms of the ultimate bailout costs to recapitalize the banking system and in terms of

foreign exchange reserve losses.

While there are an increasing number of studies looking at the association between exchange rate regime

and economic performance, the results must be treated with a high degree of caution. In particular, the

methodology employed and classification system used can vary quite a lot in the studies. Also, association does

not imply causation and there may be many other reasons for the divergences in performance, particularly as

between developed and emerging/developing countries. Developed countries usually have more stable and

better developed institutional frameworks, stronger financial systems and better access to international capital

markets, which make them better able to cope with economic shocks whatever exchange rate regime they

choose. By contrast, emerging market economies may be particularly vulnerable to economic shocks since

their financial systems and institutional frameworks are less developed and their access to capital markets

more constrained in times of economic distress.

11.18 REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM

!e present international monetary system has been called a 'non-system' as there is no clear set of exchange

rate arrangements among the major international currencies (the dollar, yen, euro and sterling), and as

Table 11.9 shows, a whole host of exchange rate regimes coexist between currencies. !e large and dramatic

currency swings between the major currencies, particularly between the dollar and other currencies, have

led to a variety of proposals to reform the system. All these proposals are based upon the view that it is

desirable to limit the exchange rate swings between the major currencies, though the proposals differ over the

best method to achieve this. !ree of the best-known proposals to bring some stability to the international

monetary system have been made by John Williamson, Ronald McKinnon and James Tobin and are worthy

- f some consideration. In section 11.21, we will also consider a more recent and more radical set of proposals
that focus on the recent crises and the perpetual problem of sovereign market debt.

11.19 THE WILLIAMSON TARGET ZONE PROPOSAL

In a number of papers, John Williamson (1985, 1987), Marcus Miller and John Williamson (1988) and Edison

et al. (1987) have proposed that the exchange rate between the major international currencies should be

managed within a target zone system. For each of the major currencies Williamson has suggested a method

to calculate the currency's 'fundamental equilibrium effective exchange rate' (FEEER). Broadly speaking, the

FEEER is a real effective exchange rate that is consistent with a sustainable current account position. !e

calculated FEEER would be periodically adjusted as the economic fundamentals change (for example, relative

in$ation rates), and should not therefore be confused with a fixed central rate. A country’s exchange rate would

then be allowed to $uctuate within a system of 'so(-edged bands' of 10% either side of the FEEER. !e idea

- f so( bands is that the authorities will not necessarily be committed to buy or sell the currency if it reaches
the upper or lower limit of its band. !is, it is argued, will prevent creating a one-way bet for speculators who
insist on selling a weak currency at the lower limit of its band knowing that the authorities will be obliged to
purchase the currency at what will prove to be a high rate once the currency is forced out of its band.

288

The International Monetary System

According to Williamson, the target zone proposal would have helped prevent the dramatic real appreciation

- f the dollar during 1980–85 because the USA would not have been able to pursue such an expansionary fiscal
policy over that period. Furthermore, Miller and Williamson (1987) argue that the target zone proposal can
help rule out the possibility of self-fulfilling and destabilizing foreign exchange speculation. !ere has been
criticism of the methodology used to calculate FEEERs and that the bands and adjustments will fail to rule

- ut major exchange rate swings. For an extensive review and critique of many issues raised by target zones the
reader is referred to Frenkel and Goldstein (1986).

11.20 THE MCKINNON GLOBAL MONETARY TARGET PROPOSAL

Ronald McKinnon (1982, 1984) has argued that much exchange rate volatility is due to the process of currency

substitution. He argues that in a world in which there are few capital controls, multinational corporations

and international investors like to hold a portfolio of various national currencies. He argues that demand

to hold a portfolio of national currencies is quite stable but that the composition of the total portfolio can

be highly volatile. !is means that rigid control of the supply of the individual national currencies in the

portfolio is inappropriate. He suggests 'that the Friedman rule for smooth monetary growth should be shi(ed

from a national to a carefully defined international level'. For example, if there is a switch in portfolios away

from the US dollar to hold the euro, and national money supplies are unchanged, there will be a depreciation

- f the dollar and appreciation of the euro. In turn, this will exert effects on the real economies of the two
economies.

McKinnon argues that these disruptive real exchange rate changes can be avoided if the European (German)

and US authorities peg their exchange rate by contracting the US money supply (thereby eliminating the

excess supply of dollars) and expanding the European money supply (thereby eliminating the excess demand

for euros). Such a result would happen if the US and European authorities pursued policies of non-sterilized

intervention in the foreign exchange market, purchasing the excess dollars with euros. !is policy, while

leading to changes in national money stocks, would leave the global money supply and exchange rates

unchanged and leave the two economies unaffected by the process of currency substitution.

!e McKinnon argument that currency substitution is a widespread phenomenon and therefore a major

cause of exchange rate volatility has been widely challenged (for example Dornbusch, 1983). It is more

likely that the major source of financial portfolio shi(s is not between domestic and foreign currencies but

between domestic and foreign bonds. As it happens, the appropriate response for dealing with such switches

is sterilized intervention to peg the exchange rate; for example, if there is a decrease in the demand for US

bonds and an increase in the demand for European bonds. !e appropriate response of the US authorities to

this would be to sell European bonds and purchase the excess supply of US bonds; this would leave interest

rates and exchange rates unchanged.

!ere are numerous problems with the McKinnon proposal. Many economists dispute his suggestion that

currency substitution is a major force in exchange rate movements. Also, by fixing the nominal exchange rate

at some PPP level the proposal does not allow for the possibility of real exchange rate changes which some

economists believe have been a major force behind large exchange rate swings. As we saw in Chapter 6, if

Japanese tradables productivity growth is higher than US tradables growth, then over time there needs to be a

real appreciation of the yen against the dollar. If not, the yen will become undervalued in relation to the dollar

and this could lead to serious trade frictions.

289

International Finance

11.21 THE TOBIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TAX PROPOSAL

James Tobin (1978) has argued that much of the disruptive exchange rate movements witnessed under

$oating regimes have been caused by destabilizing short-term capital $ows. He argues (p. 154) that the

highly integrated world capital markets leave very little room for national authorities to pursue independent

monetary policies:

National economies and national governments are not capable of adjusting to massive movements

  - f funds across the foreign exchanges, without real hardship and without significant sacrifice of the
  - bjectives of national economic policy with respect to employment, output, and in$ation. Specifically,
the mobility of financial capital limits viable differences among national interest rates and this severely
restricts the ability of central banks and governments to pursue monetary and fiscal policies appropriate
to their national economies.

Specifically, a raising of the domestic interest rate can cause a sharp real appreciation, while a lowering

- f interest rates can lead to a sharp real depreciation. To reduce these effects, Tobin suggests that a tax be
imposed on all foreign exchange transactions 'to throw some sand in the wheels of our excessively e'cient
international money markets' (ibid.). !e tax would reduce the incentives for speculators suddenly to $ood
money into and out of a currency in response to small interest rate changes. He argues that a small tax of, say,
1% would especially hit short-term capital movements but not greatly interfere with longer-term ones. !is
would restore some autonomy to domestic monetary authorities.

Tobin acknowledges that, in order to be effective and avoid evasion, the tax would have to be applied to all

foreign exchange transactions and not merely to capital transactions. He acknowledges that there would be a

curtailing effect on international trade but argues that the reduced exchange rate movements and extra degree

- f national monetary autonomy would be worthwhile.

Tobin's proposal differs significantly from those of Williamson and McKinnon because his proposal is

motivated by the belief that the exchange rate regime is not the major problem; rather he traces the problem

to excessive capital movements. He displays considerable scepticism over the rationality of foreign exchange

market speculation and argues that, unlike irrational speculation in innocuous markets like rare coins, such

speculation in the foreign exchange market has very harmful effects.

!ere have been numerous criticisms levelled against Tobin's proposal. Clearly not all short-term capital

movements are undesirable, and the tax would prevent some stabilizing movements. For instance, to the

extent that the tax was effective it would reduce the depth and breadth of markets, and this reduction in

liquidity could well make the markets more volatile than less. Furthermore, some argue that in order to be

effective the tax would have to be set at a level that would have a significant curtailing effect on international

trade. Another problem is that with today's modern financial markets it is likely that the tax would be easily

circumvented as financial innovation would lead to a replication of speculative positions through synthetic

instruments that were unaffected by the tax. As for the extra degree of national monetary autonomy that the

policy may give, it is not clear that this would be wisely used. It is argued that it is precisely the threat of sudden

exchange rate movements that imposes a degree of discipline on national authorities' conduct of economic

policies; as Haggard and Maxfield (1996, p. 36) put it, 'increased financial integration holds governments

hostage to foreign exchange and capital markets, forcing greater fiscal and monetary discipline than they

might otherwise choose'. Finally, in a bid to avoid the tax there could a greater use of barter trade which is

notoriously ine'cient.

290

The International Monetary System

11.22 REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE

!e aim of the debate on reform of the international financial architecture has been about reducing the

frequency of crises and also the costs, both financial and economic, when they do occur. !e origins of this

debate follow on from a study commissioned by the G10 industrialized nations to see what lessons could be

distilled from the Mexican 1994–95 crisis. !e report was chaired by Jean-Jacques Rey from Belgium and has

become known as the Rey Report (1996). It was particularly concerned about the problem of moral hazard

and the fact that automatic recourse to large-scale o'cial financing was bailing out imprudent borrowers and

lenders alike:

Neither debtor countries nor their creditors should expect to be insulated from adverse financial

consequences by the provision of large-scale o'cial financing in the event of a crisis. Markets are

equipped, or should be equipped, to assess the risks involved in lending to sovereign borrowers and to

set the prices and other terms of the instruments accordingly.

!e series of crises that have a%icted developing/emerging market economies, such as the Asian financial

crisis and more recently the global financial crisis that started in 2007, has stimulated a more intense debate

about whether there are fundamental $aws in the international monetary system that need addressing. In

particular, as we shall see in Chapter 17, the Asian financial crisis affected a number of countries which looked

to be in good shape on the basis of their macroeconomic fundamentals. None of the countries was running

excessive budget deficits, in$ation rates were under control and none were engaging in overly expansionary

monetary policies. Although there were current account imbalances they hardly seemed to merit the kind of

crisis that subsequently occurred. In retrospect, it seems that the crisis that a%icted these economies was not

because of national policy mismanagement, but rather something to do with fundamental $aws in the current

international financial system. In addition, international policy-makers were disturbed by the way in which

an apparently innocuous devaluation of the !ai baht could have such a contagious effect on so many other

countries. !e term 'economic contagion' captures the idea that an adverse economic event in one country can

quickly spread and infect (that is, provoke a crisis) in otherwise healthy-looking economies. Another element

- f the international system has been the large amount of sovereign debt that has made countries vulnerable
to speculative attacks. In a speech on 26 November 2001, Anne Krueger, Deputy Managing Director of the
IMF, put it this way:

We lack incentives to help countries with unsustainable debts resolve them promptly and in an orderly

way. At present the only available mechanism requires the international community to bail out the

private creditors. It is high time this hole was filled.

We cannot go into great detail on all the various proposals for reform that have been put forward or the

criticisms and merits of them here – the interested reader is referred to Rogoff (1999) and Frankel (1999))–

but it is clear that there are a number of elements that those arguing for reform are concerned about. It

should also be remembered that there are those that argue that the present system is not really in need of

much reform. Instead, they argue that prevention is better than the cure and there would be less likelihood

- f crises if the banking and financial systems in developing and emerging market economies were improved.
In particular, there should be more transparency in the provision of information; better banking systems

- perating with proper risk-return criteria, combined with better regulation and supervision; and improved

291

International Finance

corporate governance of the companies to which they lend. !ese should be coupled with sounder rules for

public finances and independent central banks mandated to seek price stability, and so forth.

!ere is an intense debate about the role of the IMF in the international monetary system. At one extreme

some would like to see it abolished since its very existence encourages some reckless behaviour on the part

- f borrowers and lenders of funds, who factor in the likelihood of an IMF rescue package should things go
wrong. In other words, the IMF itself introduces moral hazard (see Box 17.1 in Chapter 17 for more details)
into international capital markets, making crises more likely to occur than if it did not exist. At the other
extreme, there are those that argue that the IMF lacks the necessary funds to do its job properly: it is forced
to require overly burdensome adjustment on the part of crisis-a%icted nations since it simply does not have
su'cient funds to grant them what they need. Others argue that the IMF needs to redefine its role and show
greater variety in its programmes than the standard de$ationary package that it normally requires a country
to follow. In particular, some critics, whilst acknowledging that the IMF has a valid role to play when crises

- ccur, argue that it should restrict itself primarily to financial issues and keep out of areas such as structural
reform requiring bank closures and privatization. It should also consider the social impact of its programmes,
for example on unemployment rates and economic growth.

Another element of the international financial system that may not be reformable, but might be made less

significant for developing and emerging market economies, is the free movement of international capital.

Some well-known economists such as Jagdish Bhagwati (1998), Paul Krugman (1998) and Dani Rodrik

(1998) have argued that the current IMF rules that require members to seek the ultimate goal of capitalaccount convertibility should be relaxed – developing and emerging market economies should be permitted

to use capital controls so that they can regain some monetary and macroeconomic independence. Bhagwati

is very critical of both the US Treasury and the IMF for rushing too many developing and emerging market

economies into relaxing their capital controls without su'cient consideration of whether their domestic

banking and financial systems are su'ciently strong and well-regulated to cope with the capital in$ows and

- ut$ows to which they would be exposed.

Some authors such as Mishkin (1994) and Fischer (1999) argue that there needs to be a new international

agency (a new international lender of last resort) with credit lines ready to make emergency loans to countries

being subjected to 'unwarranted' speculative attacks. !e mere knowledge that such an agency exists would

make speculators wary of taking on currencies where the fundamentals were relatively sound but which are

vulnerable to a speculative attack because, for instance, they possess a low level of foreign exchange reserves or

are stuck in a recession. Others are worried that such lender-of-last-resort facilities would merely exacerbate

the problem of moral hazard and that the G7 countries and the IMF countries already effectively provide such

a facility.

!e problem of the large overhang of sovereign debt has been a recurrent theme in many of the recent crises.

Some argue that certain countries have such high levels of external debt that they are effectively bankrupt or

placed in a position where economic growth is severely constrained for the foreseeable future by the need to

make debt repayments at the expense of living standards and investment in the country's future. It is argued

that there may need to be an international bankruptcy court along the lines proposed by Sachs (1995) where

nation states with excessive debt levels could go to seek some sort of protection from their creditors, akin to the

use of Chapter 11 bankruptcy provisions that corporations frequently use in the United States, or Chapter)9

provisions which cover bankrupt local and state governments. !e court would be able to grant the debtor

nation a right to suspend payments to creditors and possibly mandate an orderly restructuring package and

even debt relief. Such a court would need to be invested with powers that would be enforceable and possibly

- verride con$icting national laws and existing debt clauses. Chapter 11 provisions apply to corporations and
give the court extensive powers, including the ability to fire the existing board of directors, which is hardly

292

The International Monetary System

going to be allowed at the country level. Not everyone agrees that such a court would be a good idea; some

argue it would inevitably become 'a friend' of either the debtors or the creditors. Others argue that such a

court is unnecessary and that it should be le( to the markets to insert innovative clauses into debt securities

issued by debtor nations, making it more transparent and automatic as to what should happen in the event of

a declared default; this way investors in such bonds would have clearer evaluation of the risks they face and

less room to complain should a default be declared.

While there are numerous proposals for reform of the international financial system, it is quite clear that

there is no consensus concerning the best way to progress forward. As Eichengreen (1999) notes, some of the

grander schemes are 'politically unrealistic, technically infeasible, or unlikely to yield significant improvements

in the way crises are prevented, anticipated or managed'. !e differing proposals re$ect differing views on

what the problems are of the current system; and even when commentators agree on the identification of

a problem there is not necessarily an agreement on the best way to solve the problem. O(en the views are

diametrically opposite: some argue for $oating exchange rates while others argue that fixed rates are best;

some argue for an international lender of the last resort while others oppose it on the grounds that it will add

to the problem of moral hazard.

11.23 CONCLUSIONS

Since the Second World War the international monetary system has moved from the Bretton Woods system

which represented a cooperative venture between the major industrialized countries with the dollar at the

heart of the system into a far more diversified system. To some extent this re$ects the fact that the world

economic system has evolved from one which was dominated by the US economy to one in which economic

power is increasingly shared amongst an integrated Europe, Japan and the USA and other emerging regions

such as Southeast Asia and Latin America. While the dollar remains the major reserve currency, and this role

has to date only been infringed upon at the margins by the SDR, over time the euro will likely impinge upon

the dollar's dominance and the international monetary system is likely to look very different in 20 years' time.

A greater sharing of economic power has been accompanied by a larger degree of interdependence between

economies with respect to both trade and capital $ows, and the international monetary system has been

constantly evolving to cope with these changes. !e move to $oating exchange rates was partly motivated by

a desire to provide countries with an extra degree of independence in an increasingly interdependent world.

However, the policy divergences and real exchange rate changes throughout the 1980s and 1990s and early

part of this century have amply demonstrated that $oating exchange rates do not provide an escape from

this interdependence. !e currency turmoil in the 1990s, the post-2000 crises, and the dramatic movements

between the dollar and euro have demonstrated that a stable international monetary system has yet to

emerge. !is recognition has led to increased discussion among policy-makers about policy coordination,

and economists have become increasingly interested in the empirical performance of different exchange rate

regimes. At times, such as indicated by the Plaza and Louvre Accords, this discussion has led to concerted

action. Dissatisfaction with the present system, particularly with the large real exchange rate changes that

have occurred, has led to a variety of differing proposals which all seem to have the motivation to limit by one

means or another the substantial real exchange rate changes that have occurred. Many of the recent crises have

been concentrated in developing and emerging market economies and there is an intense debate about what

is the best exchange rate regime that such countries should adopt.

!ere have recently been a number of empirical studies looking at the choice of exchange rate regime

- n macroeconomic performance, and while the results are somewhat unclear and need to be interpreted

293

International Finance

with caution, it does seem to be the case that fixed exchange rates may well be more appropriate regimes for

developing countries with limited access to international markets and who lack stable institutional structures

and developed financial markets. For developed nations which have ready access to international capital

markets, stable institutional frameworks and relatively well-developed financial institutions/markets, the

choice of exchange rate regime does not matter so much. More interestingly, the recent research tentatively

suggests that the choice of regime may well be more critical for emerging market economies that are developing

their institutional infrastructures, financial institutions and markets and that have significant but volatile

access to international capital markets. !e evidence, although not clear-cut, suggests that as they develop,

emerging market economies may well benefit in the way of improved economic performance and reduced risk

- f a crisis by increasing the degree of $exibility accorded to the exchange rate.
