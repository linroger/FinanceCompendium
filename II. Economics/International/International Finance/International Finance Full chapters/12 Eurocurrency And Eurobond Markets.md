12.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter we take a detailed look at two important markets that exert a great deal of in$uence on the

international financial system: the eurocurrency market and the Eurobond market. Eurocurrency markets

are defined as banking markets which involve short-term borrowing and lending conducted outside of the

legal jurisdiction of the authorities of the currency that is used. For example, eurodollar deposits are dollar

deposits held in London and Paris. !e eurocurrency market has two sides to it: the receipt of deposits and

the loaning out of those deposits. By far the most important eurocurrency is the eurodollar which currently

accounts for approximately 60–65% of all eurocurrency activity, followed by the euroeuro, eurofrancs (Swiss),

eurosterling and euroyen. !e use of the prefix 'euro' is somewhat misleading because dollar deposits held

by banks in Hong Kong or Tokyo are equally outside the legal jurisdiction of the US authorities and also

constitute eurodollar deposits. !is more widespread geographical base means that euromarkets are o(en

referred to as 'offshore' markets.

Since the 1960s there has been an astonishing rate of growth of the eurocurrency market (see Table 12.1). In

1963 the gross total value of eurobank assets (a similar figure applies to deposit liabilities) was approximately

\$12.4 billion, but by mid-2020 the eurodollar market stood at \$32,633 billion, which works out at an average

growth rate of 14.8% per annum over the 57 years! Measuring the actual size of the eurocurrency market

presents some di'culty because a distinction needs to be made between the gross and net size. !e gross

measure includes both non-eurobank and interbank deposits, while the net measure excludes interbank

deposits. !e gross measure gives an idea about the overall activity in the euromarkets, while the net measure

gives a better indication concerning the ability of the eurobanking system to create credit.

!e eurocurrency market is part of the international money market since it involves lending and borrowing

for a period of less than a year. By contrast, the Eurobond market is part of the international capital market

and involves lending and borrowing for periods of more than a year. A Eurobond is a bond that is sold by

a government, institution or company in a currency that is different from the country where the bond is

issued. For example, a dollar bond sold in London is a dollar Eurobond, and a sterling bond sold in Germany

is a sterling Eurobond. Both the eurocurrency and Eurobond markets are in many ways phenomena of the

increasingly open world trading system. !ere is no reason why borrowing and lending in a given currency

needs to be carried out exclusively in the particular country that issues the currency.

In this chapter, we deal with the origins and reasons for the subsequent rapid growth of eurocurrency and

Eurobond markets over the last three decades. We also examine the basic functioning of these markets and

their economic impact. Firstly, we look at the eurocurrency markets and then the Eurobond markets.

12.2 PARTICIPANTS IN THE EUROCURRENCY AND EUROBOND MARKETS

Before looking at the eurocurrency and Eurobond markets it is worth examining the participants who

use these markets and their motivations. !ere are numerous participants in the international money and

capital markets, including national governments; local authorities; and financial institutions – such as banks,

296

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

multinational firms, companies and international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the

World Bank and the European Investment Bank – as well as private investors. Most industrialized countries'

participants act both as lenders and borrowers of funds, while many developing countries use the markets

almost exclusively for borrowing purposes. !e various types of capital $ows between economic agents of

different countries are motivated by various factors; these include:

**Trade financing motive:** much trade is financed by borrowing on the international money and

capital markets;

2. **Borrowing/lending motive:** many capital $ows are simply motivated by the desire of savers to get the

best possible return on their money, while borrowers are merely seeking to obtain the lowest possible

interest rate;

3. **Speculative motive:** much borrowing or lending is due to the taking of speculative positions based

	- n profiting from prospective interest rate and exchange rate changes;

4. **Hedging motive:** much borrowing and lending is motivated by a desire to hedge positions; that is, to

avoid losses resulting from prospective interest rate and exchange rate changes;

5. **Capital flight motive:** many movements of capital are motivated by a desire to protect investors'

funds from penal taxation, possible seizure by the domestic government or to escape potential

restrictions being imposed on convertibility or to avoid political risk.

12.3 THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE EUROCURRENCY MARKET

!e origins of the eurocurrency market can be traced back to 1957. !e Russians having acquired US dollars

through their exports of raw materials were, given the strong anti-communist sentiment prevailing in the

USA and the Cold War, reluctant to hold these funds with US banks. Instead, they were held in an account

with a French bank in Paris, the cable address of which was EURO-BANK. Also in 1957, the Bank of England

introduced restrictions on UK banks' ability to lend sterling to foreigners and foreigners' ability to borrow

sterling. !is induced UK banks to turn to the US dollar as a means of retaining London's leading role in

the financing of world trade. In 1958 the abolition of the European Payments Union and restoration of

convertibility of European currencies meant that European banks could now hold US dollars without being

forced to convert these dollar holdings with their central banks for domestic currencies.

An important impetus for the rapid growth of the eurodollar market came from the increased regulation

- f domestic banking activities by the US authorities. !ree measures were of particular note in this respect.
In 1963 the US government introduced 'Regulation Q' which imposed a 5.25% ceiling on the rate of interest
that US banks could pay on savings and time-deposit accounts (the idea being to prevent US banks pushing
up interest rates in a competition for depositors' funds, which might then lead to risky lending policies). Since
the regulation did not apply to offshore banks this encouraged many US banks to set up subsidiaries abroad
in centres such as London. In the same year, the US authorities concerned about the impact of capital out$ows

- n the US balance of payments introduced the Interest Equalization Tax (IET). !e IET raised the cost to
foreigners of borrowing dollars in New York; but this then led them to borrow funds on the eurodollar market
(the IET was abolished in 1974). A further measure that restricted lending to foreigners by US banks was the
Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint Guidelines which were issued in 1965 and made compulsory in 1968.

!is increased regulation of US domestic banks gave a boost to the development of eurobanking activities

to circumvent the effects of these controls. Many US banks decided to set up foreign branches and subsidiaries

297

International Finance

to escape the banking regulations. Indeed, since US banking law severely restricted US banks' ability to operate

in more than one state, setting up subsidiaries abroad was an important means of expansion. More importantly,

the regulations conferred a competitive edge to eurobanks which were not subject to such regulations.

Following the hike in oil prices in 1973/74, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries

(OPEC) deposited large amounts of surplus dollars on the euromarkets. !e eurobanks then on-lent much

- f the funds to oil-importing countries that faced balance of payments problems. As such the eurobanks
played an important intermediary role in recycling funds from the surplus OPEC countries to the deficit oilimporting countries. A similar role was performed by the eurobanks following the second oil price shock at
the end of 1978, though on a lesser scale. !e vast majority of loans made by the eurobanks to the developing
countries in the 1970s and early 1980s were made by syndicates of eurobanks. A syndicate is normally led by
a lead or managing bank, with other banks that wish to participate in a loan contributing to its funding. Such
syndicated loans are useful from the perspective of individual eurobanks because they reduce the exposure

- f a eurobank to a given borrower, and by participating in a wide range of syndicated loans a eurobank can
diversify and reduce its loan risks far more than by engaging in a limited number of large individual loans.

A final factor behind the growth of eurobanking activity has been the rapid growth of world trade, which

means that more companies have excess working balances in a foreign currency on which they seek high rates

- f return, while others require short-term borrowing facilities at competitive rates of interest.

In December 1981 the Federal Reserve, recognizing that many US banks had set up offshore branches

to avoid US regulations in exotic locations such as the Bahamas and Cayman Islands, decided to legalize

so-called international banking facilities (IBFs). IBFs essentially permit US banks to conduct eurobanking

business free of US regulations in the United States by maintaining a separate set of books for this business.

IBFs are not subject to reserve requirements, interest rate regulations or deposit insurance premiums, but they

can only accept deposits and make loans to non-US residents. In addition, IBF business is maintained on a

separate book to the parent bank. IBFs have proved to be popular since their inception and much business

that was previously carried out in offshore o'ces has been relocated back to the USA. Following the success

- f IBFs, in 1986 the Japanese government permitted the setting-up of a Japanese Onshore Market (JOM)
which likewise permits Japanese banks to take on euroyen deposits in Tokyo provided these are not on-lent
to domestic Japanese residents.

12.4 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EURODOLLAR MARKET

!e major centres for eurobank activity are London, Paris, New York, Tokyo and Luxembourg. Offshore

banking centres in Bahrain, Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Panama, the Netherlands, Antilles

and Singapore account for most of the remaining business.

Eurobanks are generally free of government regulation, and more specifically they do not face compulsory

reserve requirements, interest ceilings or deposit insurance. !e main users of the eurocurrency market

facilities are the eurobanks themselves, non-eurobank financial institutions, multinational corporations,

international institutions, and central and local government. Multinationals are attracted by the relatively

high interest rates paid on their surplus corporate funds and the competitive borrowing rates. International

- rganizations such as the World Bank frequently borrow funds from eurobanks for lending to developing
countries. A large proportion of eurocurrency transactions are between eurobanks themselves, those with
surplus funds loaning to eurobanks that have lending possibilities but are short of funds.

!e pivotal rate of interest for the eurocurrency markets is the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR),

which is the rate of interest that London clearing banks will charge for loans between themselves on the

298

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

London interbank market. Non-bank borrowers then pay a spread above LIBOR depending on their credit

rating and the lending bank's transaction costs; non-bank depositors typically receive a rate of interest on their

deposits below LIBOR. In the early days of the euromarket, the interest paid on deposits and charged for loans

was usually fixed for the whole period of the deposit or loan. Increasingly, however, $oating interest rates

based on LIBOR have become the norm for mediumto long-term (above six months) deposits and loans.

With $oating rates, the interest charged on a mediumto long-term loan is adjusted every three or six months

to stay a fixed spread above LIBOR. In effect, many long-term loans are a succession of short-term loans that

are automatically 'rolled over', but at interest rates that vary in line with changes in LIBOR. !ere are usually

penalties to be paid if deposits are withdrawn before maturity.

One of the interesting characteristics of the structure of eurobank assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits)

is that they are predominately of a short-term nature with some deposits being as short as one day (overnight

deposit) and the vast majority under six months. Furthermore, there is a close matching of the maturity

structure of deposits and liabilities. Typically, if money is taken in for three (six) months then it will be loaned

- ut for three (six) months. !is is because eurobanks have to be wary of sudden large withdrawals of shortterm funds. Another motivation behind the close matching of assets and liabilities is that it reduces the risks
to the banks due to interest $uctuations. Consider a simple example of the risk involved when liabilities and
assets are not matched. In the case where a eurobank receives a \$1 million three-month deposit on which it
has to pay 7.5% interest and it loans out the funds at 8% for six months, if at the end of three months a rise in
deposit interest rates means that it has to pay 9% to retain the deposit, it would effectively be losing money

- n the remaining three months on the outstanding loan. !is would not be the case if the loan was renewable
at three months since it could then raise the interest charged on the loan for its remaining three months to,
say, 9.5%. !is close matching of assets and liabilities stands in contrast to the balance sheets of domestic
banks which usually accept short-term demand and time deposits and then engage in mediumto long-term
lending. It should be noted that since 1982 the existence of eurodollar futures markets in Chicago, New York
and London has enabled eurobanks to protect themselves against interest $uctuations without matching their
assets and liabilities.

12.5 THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF EUROBANKS

!e main reason for the continuing success of eurobanking, despite the relaxation of regulation on US banks,

is that they are able to offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates than US banks. It is this competitive edge

which is the fundamental reason for their continued popularity and growth. !e competitive advantage of

eurobanks is illustrated in Figure 12.1.

International Finance

!e eurobanks are generally able to pay a higher rate on deposits and charge a lower rate for loans than

US banks can for similar facilities. !is implies that the interest rate spread, that is, the difference between the

rate paid on deposits and charged for loans, is lower for the eurobanks than US banks. !e lower euro-interest

spread can be accounted for by a number of factors:

1. Eurobanks, unlike domestic banks, are free of regulatory control and in particular they are not

required to hold reserve assets. !is gives them a competitive advantage over domestic banks which

are required to hold part of their assets in zero or low-interest liquid assets to meet o'cial reserve

requirements. Since eurobanks are not subject to reserve requirements they are able to hold less

money in the form of low-interest reserves, enabling them to pay a higher interest rate on deposits

and charge a lower rate on loans. For example, up until 1990 the Federal Reserve imposed a 3%

reserve requirement on US banks so that for every \$100 taken in only \$97 could be lent out, on an

interest rate of 10%, which amounts to the need to charge 10.31% to cover the cost of the reserves.

Eurobanks benefit from economies of scale; the average size of their deposits and loans (hundreds

    - f thousands and usually millions of dollars) is considerably greater than those of domestic banks

(usually tens, hundreds and thousands of dollars). !is means the average operating cost associated

with each dollar deposit and loan transaction is much lower for eurobanks.

3. Eurobanks avoid much of the personnel, administration costs and delays associated with complying

with domestic banking regulations. Eurobanks do not have to maintain a large branch network for

their business, whereas domestic banking activity usually requires the maintenance of an extensive

branch network. In addition, domestic banks need extensive internal control mechanisms and large

costly legal departments, whereas eurobanks have far less need for these.

4. !e eurobanking business is highly competitive internationally with relatively easy entrance

requirements as compared to domestic banking activity, which encourages greater e'ciency and

more competitive pricing on the part of eurobanks.

5. Eurobanks do not have to pay deposit insurance whereas US banks have to insure their deposit base

with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

6. Eurobank lending is almost exclusively to high-quality customers with a virtually negligible default rate,

which contrasts with the relatively high default rates faced by domestic banks that have to charge an

appropriate default risk premium in the way of higher lending rates and lower deposit rates of interest.

12.6 THE COEXISTENCE OF DOMESTIC AND EUROBANKING

Since eurobanks generally pay higher interest rates on deposits and charge lower interest rates on loans than

US-based banks, it is natural to ask why all borrowing and lending is not carried out via eurobanks. !e

answer lies in the transaction costs for the parties involved. It usually pays a US firm to go to its local US bank

for a loan because the local bank will have a record and understanding of the business and will be able to

assess more easily the risk of lending to the business, secure collateral and monitor the progress of the loan.

If the firm were to go to a eurobank it could prove expensive to convince the eurobank that it is creditworthy

and that the project is soundly based. Similarly, except for substantial sums of money, it is not usually worth

individuals and small enterprises holding a eurodeposit as they rarely have su'cient surplus funds to be

- f interest to the eurobanks, and most private agents prefer the use of other bank facilities such as cheque
accounts, easy access to funds and the like, which are not offered by the eurobanks.

300

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

12.7 THE CREATION OF EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS AND LOANS

Eurobanks are basically financial intermediaries whose function is channelling funds from a non-bank

lender to a non-bank borrower. Between the deposit and the lending there may be a series of interbank

transactions. To enhance the understanding of eurocurrency markets we will consider a hypothetical example

- f how eurocurrency deposits and loans are created. Assume that a US multinational 'SUPER Corp' starts
- ff the process by transferring \$50 million from its US bank account into a eurodollar deposit account with
‘EUROBANK A’. EUROBANK A may not have an immediate use for these funds. However, EUROBANK B
has a client ‘MINI Corp’ who wishes to borrow \$50 million, but EUROBANK B is short of the necessary funds.
In this instance, EUROBANK B borrows the \$50 million from EUROBANK A at $LIBOR and then loans the
funds to the ultimate borrower MINI Corp. A summary of these transactions is shown in Figure 12.2.

From these transactions we can see what has basically occurred: SUPER Corp has switched a dollar deposit

from a US bank to EUROBANK A; EUROBANK A has a new deposit liability to SUPER Corp, but now also

holds increased funds which it can utilize for lending purposes. As far as the US banking system is concerned,

the amount of deposits held by the non-bank public has fallen; however, these funds have been switched into

the eurobanking arena. !e transfer of funds from EUROBANK A to EUROBANK B constitutes an interbank

transaction, the effect of which is to raise the total of eurodollar deposits from \$50 million to \$100 million.

We can now distinguish between the effect on the net size of the eurodollar market – the original \$50 million

deposit and the gross size of \$100 million, which includes the interbank transaction. With the loan to MINI

Corp the funds that were initially deposited by SUPER Corp have been given an ultimate use.

!e eurobanks are in effect acting as financial intermediaries, ensuring that surplus funds from one

- rganization (SUPER Corp) are transferred to other organizations with borrowing requirements (MINI
Corp). When MINI Corp starts to spend money, then the dollars have ultimately been derived from the US
banking system, not from the eurobanks. Only the US banking system creates dollars; the eurobanks create
deposits which are not a means of payment. Eurobanks are essentially financial intermediaries: they accept
deposits and then loan out these funds.

!e real question which now arises is what MINI Corp does with its borrowed funds. If it were just to

redeposit them with another eurobank then the whole process could be restarted; however, this is most

unlikely to be the case. More likely, MINI Corp will use the funds to pay various bills due or to finance a

project, and only a small fraction of its \$50 million (for example, \$1 million to \$5 million) will eventually end

up back in the eurobanking system which can then be used to create further credit.

!is is a highly simplified example of the way the eurobanking system creates credit. !ere are some

- bvious limits to the amount of credit created by the eurobanking system. In the first instance, EUROBANK
A and EUROBANK B are unlikely to lend out instantly all the deposits they receive; and MINI Corp is likely

\$50 million

**Figure 12.2** !e creation of eurobanking activity

to redeposit only a fraction of its money with the eurobanking system. It is quite likely that most of the money

received by MINI Corp will eventually be reinjected into the American economy and thereby returned to the

US banking system, from which there may be some limited leakage back to the eurocurrency markets.

12.8 THE PROS AND CONS OF THE EUROCURRENCY MARKETS

One of the major concerns expressed about eurocurrency markets is that they have enormous amounts of

funds and the potential to create credit and yet remain unregulated. Some argue that eurobanking activity is

a ticking time-bomb underneath the world financial system. !e fact that eurobanks are not regulated and do

not have access to lender-of-last-resort facilities, combined with the high degree of interbank activity, has led

to concerns that the failure of one eurobank would have serious knock-on effects on other eurobanks and in

so doing endanger the entire international financial system.

Another concern expressed about the euromoney markets is their potential impact on in$ation. !e

rapid growth of the eurocurrency markets in the 1960s and 1970s coincided with a pronounced rise in the

in$ation rates of the industrialized nations. Some policy-makers and economists argued that eurocurrency

market growth was partly responsible for this. !e basis of the argument was that the growth of eurocurrency

markets with no reserve requirements had an expansionary effect on national money supplies and thereby

helped to fuel in$ation rates. For example, Friedman (1969) and Mayer (1970) made initial estimates which

suggested that euromarkets had a very expansionary effect on money supplies because of their low reserve

ratios. However, Klopstock (1968) noted that eurobanks have very low redeposit ratios which considerably

reduces their ability to create credit. Furthermore, McKinnon (1977) makes the important point that what is

important in deciding whether eurobanks are responsible for credit creation is their net addition to the supply

- f dollars, that is, the addition to the global supply of dollars as compared to the supply of dollars in their
absence. On this basis he finds little evidence to support the view that the eurocurrency markets have led to
a massive expansion of global money supplies. Other authors, such as Duffey and Giddy (1978), have argued
that the eurodollar market is essentially a substitute for the domestic dollar market on both the deposit and
loan side. In the first instance, the deposits they attract are essentially taken away from the US banking system,
while the loans that they make are likewise substitutes for loans by US banks. !is being the case, the idea of
a separate eurodollar multiplier is not a particularly relevant concept.

Hogan and Pearce (1982) have objected to the euromoney markets on other grounds; in particular they

are very concerned about the fact that euromarkets enable deficit countries to finance their deficits with

relative ease and believe the euromarkets encourage excessive borrowing. !ey argue that the rapid growth

- f eurocurrency markets is due to one set of countries being in persistent balance of payments surplus and
another group in persistent deficit. !e eurocurrency markets are viewed as recycling funds from the surplus
countries to the deficit countries; and if the recycling goes on for a number of years the outstanding loans
to deficit countries will grow and grow. Further, deficit countries can avoid the need to pursue prudent
macroeconomic policies. !ey argue that there are a number of dangers that could hit the eurobanking
system. !e deficit countries that have over-borrowed might not wish to repay, which in turn might provoke
a crisis of confidence in the eurobanking system. Another problem might be that depositors with funds in the
system could get concerned at the growing size of eurobanks' exposure to the deficit countries which could
lead them to withdraw their dollar deposits from the eurobanks which in turn could lead to a problem for the
deficit countries that are unable to roll over their loans. Hogan and Pearce are so concerned about the buildup of debt possibilities that they advocate that euromarkets' 'immediate death should be engineered with a
maximum of speed and minimum of fuss' (1982, pp. 127–8).

302

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

It cannot be denied that in the 1970s there was a great deal of recycling of petrodollars by eurobanks to a

number of Latin American countries which had received much of the dollar surpluses of OPEC to finance

their deficits. However, a great deal of the financing of these deficits was also carried out by US domestic banks.

!e fact that much of this lending eventually proved to be unwise (see Chapter 15) is not just a judgement

against much eurobank lending, but also against the lending policies of many domestic US banks. Also, it is

not entirely clear that eurobanks are doing any harm. It must be emphasized that eurobanks ultimately act

as intermediaries for the recycling of funds because they are the most e'cient institutions for doing this. If

they had not been in existence then petrodollar recycling would most probably have still taken place, only less

e'ciently so by the US banking system.

Other authors have argued that eurobanks have enabled speculators to easily raise funds used to mount

speculative attacks on currencies and in so doing have increased currency volatility in general. Against this, it

could be argued that the fact that there are enormous sums of speculative balances on the euromarkets acts as

an important discipline of government macroeconomic policies which leads to more stable macroeconomic

policies and exchange rates.

Despite these concerns, it must be remembered that the eurocurrency markets have increased the range of

facilities available to both borrowers and lenders. In addition, they do so at very competitive rates of interest. !ey

have not only facilitated financial transfers between private economic agents, but also between countries enabling

them to finance current account deficits with somewhat greater ease than before the euromarkets existed.

12.9 EUROMARKETS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND POLICY

While domestic banking has remained subject to various regulatory requirements this is not the case with

euromarkets. Examples of two of the most commonly used regulations governing domestic banking activities

are reserve requirements imposed by the authorities to limit domestic banks' ability to create credit, and

deposit insurance designed to protect depositors should a bank become insolvent.

!e lack of regulation governing eurobanks has o(en led to calls for some degree of international regulation

- f their activities. In particular, given the amount of interbank lending on the euromarkets, there has always
been a fear that were one eurobank to fail this could trigger the failure of many eurobanks. !is being the
case, the need for effective regulation has been regarded as important in ensuring that eurobanks conduct
their business in a sound manner. However, effective regulation of eurobanks is fraught with problems. If the
US authorities were to regulate US eurobanks, all this would be likely to do is to shi( eurobanking activities
to non-US eurobanks. Similarly, if regulation is exercised by a particular eurobanking centre such as London,
then all this would be likely to do is to shi( eurobanking business to other non-regulated centres. Unilateral
regulation by one particular government or eurobanking centre is unlikely to lead to greater regulation of
eurobanking activity because it would most probably just result in a shi( of eurobanking business to other
unregulated eurobanks and centres.

It would seem that effective regulation of eurobanking activities would require multilateral regulation

and guidelines. However, given the high degree of competition for eurobanking business, such multilateral

cooperation is unlikely to be forthcoming. !e very fact that eurobanks have managed to grow rapidly because

- f the lack of regulation of their activities has probably had the effect of reducing the degree of regulation
covering domestic banking activity. Once a regulation is applied to a domestic banking activity, it is o(en the
case that the business is diverted to the eurobanks where it is free of the constraint. Furthermore, the desire
to bring some eurobank business back to the domestic banking arena has o(en acted as a stimulus to the
relaxation of domestic regulations.

International Finance

12.10 THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKET AND THE EUROBOND MARKET

!e international capital market is a longer-term market than the eurocurrency market, in which borrowers

and lenders of funds from different countries are brought together to exchange funds. !e international capital

market is made up of three markets: (1) the domestic bond market, (2) the foreign bond market and (3) the

Eurobond market. A domestic bond is a bond issued in the currency of the country of issue by a domestic

entity; for example, a US dollar Treasury bond issued by the US Treasury or a dollar corporate bond issued

by a US corporation in the United States. A foreign bond is a bond issued by a foreign entity in the domestic

currency of the country of issue. An example of this would be a British company that issues a dollar bond in

the US market – such a foreign bond is known as a Yankee. Other foreign bonds have names symbolizing the

country whose currency is being borrowed, such as Bulldogs for sterling bonds, Samurais for yen bonds and

Matadors for Spanish euro-denominated bonds. A Eurobond is a bond that is sold by a government, institution

- r company in a currency different from the country where the bond is issued. For example, a dollar bond sold
in London is a dollar Eurobond, and a sterling bond sold in Luxembourg is a sterling Eurobond.

Since the early 1960s, the international capital market has grown at an astonishing pace both in terms of

the funds transferred and the number of participants in the market. !e Eurobond market has grown from its

- rigins in the mid-1960s to such an extent that the outstanding value of dollar Eurobonds issued significantly
exceeds the issue of domestic US corporate bonds. !ese days there is no need for securities markets to
be restricted to national boundaries. Economic agents may seek to raise funds in either the domestic or a
foreign currency and in seeking to raise the funds at the cheapest possible cost they may seek the assistance of
foreign financial institutions and foreign financial centres who in turn can attract both domestic and foreign
investors. In the following section, we pay particular attention to the Eurobond market which has become a
particularly significant source of funds.

12.11 THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE EUROBOND MARKET

!e first Eurobond was issued in 1963 and since then the market has grown enormously, particularly during

the 1980s and 1990s. !e Eurobond market dates back to the imposition of the Interest Equalization Tax (IET)

by the US authorities on US citizens that held dollar bonds issued by foreign entities in the United States. !e

US authorities imposed the tax because of concern about the long-term out$ow of capital on the US balance

- f payments. By reducing the attractiveness to US investors of investing in foreign bonds, the tax provided a
stimulus for foreign entities to issue US dollar bonds outside of the United States. A further incentive for the
development of the Eurobond market was that the US authorities also imposed withholding taxes on foreign
citizens that held US bonds, which meant that foreign citizens had a clear incentive to hold Eurobonds that
were not subject to taxation by the US authorities.

Although the IET was abolished in 1974 and withholding taxes removed in 1984, the Eurobond market

continued to prosper. Growth in the 1980s was partly stimulated by the fact that corporations found banks

increasingly reluctant to lend funds due to problems stemming from the debt crisis in the developing world.

Furthermore, many corporations realized that they could exploit their credit ratings, which were o(en as

good if not better than some of the banks that they had traditionally borrowed funds from, especially as they

increasingly deemed the rates of interest and security requirement of banks to be excessive. In addition, many

corporations found that banks were reluctant to lend at fixed rates of interest at the longer time horizons

that corporations were interested in. !e major advantage of a Eurobond issue over domestic and foreign

bond issues is that there are less stringent regulatory and disclosure requirements on the corporate issuer

304

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

and that a greater variety of different bond types can be issued. In summary, the Eurobond market generally

means lower-cost finance for well-known companies than borrowing directly from banks or the domestic

bond market.

12.12 TYPICAL FEATURES OF A EUROBOND

Dollar-denominated Eurobonds have traditionally been the most popular form of issue, although the dollar

predominance is less than in the eurocurrency loans market. In recent years, however, the euro has been

very popular. !e main reason for this is that many corporations have been keen to attract savings from

countries with high savings ratios, especially Japan and Germany, whose investors tend to be more keen to

buy Eurobonds which are denominated in their local currency.

Most (approximately 75%) Eurobond issues are undertaken by very highly rated institutions with AAA and

AA credit ratings. !e market is used extensively by governments, international organizations such as the World

Bank, the European Investment Bank and multinational corporations. Some issuers use the market to raise

funds in currencies they do not wish ultimately to hold but as part of a swap deal (see Chapter 13). !e yield

at which a borrower obtains funds will depend on market conditions and the credit rating of the issuer, with

governments typically being able to raise funds at a lower cost than corporations with an equivalent credit rating.

Eurobonds come in a variety of forms, and the most common type are known as **straights**, which pay fixed

rates of interest with repayment of principal upon maturity. Increasingly popular are **floating-rate notes** which

are Eurobonds on which the interest rate is adjusted every three to six months in line with changes in a key

interest rate such as LIBOR. Floating-rate issues are especially popular with banks that wish to invest surplus

funds, since the $oating rate of interest means that the capital value of the bond is largely unaffected by interest

rate movements. A convertible bond gives the owner the right to convert the bond into ordinary shares in the

issuing company at a predetermined price sometime in the future. Convertible bonds usually pay a belowmarket rate of interest with holders attracted by the potential gain on the possibility of a share price conversion.

Some Eurobonds have a warrant attached that gives the holder the right to buy shares in the company at a

predetermined price in the future; the warrants can be detached from the bond and traded separately.

!e Eurobond market is primarily a medium-term borrowing market with the vast majority of issues

(approximately 80%) being for under ten years with many typically for four to seven years, which contrasts

with the domestic bond market that is generally speaking a longer-term market with most borrowing ranging

from 10 to 30 years. Most Eurobonds are issued at fixed rates of interest and others are issued at $oating rates

- f interest or equity related. Many issues are sold at short notice to take advantage of what are perceived to be
favourable market conditions. Table 12.3 summarizes the typical features of a dollar Eurobond issue.

!e bearer form of most Eurobond issues is a particular attraction for international investors who like to

avoid open registration of their ownership (although they are legally obliged to reveal coupon earnings to

their tax authorities, this may not always happen!). Another attraction of Eurobond issues for investors is that

they are free of withholding taxes and this means that investors can save on paperwork when seeking to avoid

double taxation on their interest income. !e typical Eurobond investor has been characterized as a 'Belgian

dentist', an investor who wishes to earn a little bit more interest than is available on government bonds but who

also wants a very safe investment and is hence attracted by the high credit rating of most Eurobond issuers.

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

12.13 CONTROL AND REGULATION OF THE EUROBOND MARKET

Eurobonds are generally exempt from the rules and regulations that govern the issue of foreign bonds in

a country; for example, the need to issue very detailed prospectuses and withholding taxes (taxes on nonresidents which are deducted at source). However, Eurobond issues and trading do have to meet certain

regulatory requirements, and a self-regulatory body known as the International Securities Market Association

sets the rules and standards.

Despite the fact that the Eurobond market is by definition outside the legal jurisdiction of the country of

the currency of issue, this does not mean that the national authorities of the currency in question are unable

to exert significant in$uence on it. National governments have always exerted control on national capital

markets for a number of reasons; the most important is that they are usually huge borrowers themselves,

they are keen to encourage scarce domestic capital to be invested in domestic bond issues and they are also

concerned about possible tax avoidance and the impact of out$ows of capital on the value of their currency.

Governments still have a number of means of controlling the issue of Eurobonds in their national currencies.

Firstly, most clearance of funds raised in Eurobond issues is done through the clearing system of the domestic

banking system of the currency in question, giving the central bank of that currency the ability to prohibit

issues if it so wishes. Secondly, governments can exert pressure on both domestic investment banks and foreign

investment banks not to participate in Eurobond issues with the implicit threat of losing government business

and ultimately their licence to operate in their country. !e Swiss authorities have effectively prevented

Eurobond issues in Swiss francs, requiring all Swiss franc issues to be done in Switzerland, and the Japanese

have managed to exert strong control over Eurobond issues in yen.

!e US authorities have generally had a concerned but tolerant attitude to the Eurobond market. !e main

concern has been that because Eurobonds are issued in bearer form then the possibility of tax avoidance is

high. Another concern is that the US government is itself a large borrower of funds and to some extent finds

itself in competition with the attractive rates of interest offered on dollar Eurobonds. !e US authorities also

claim that they wish to protect US investors from investment risk due to the looser regulatory and disclosure

requirements. For these reasons, the US authorities prohibit the sale of Eurobonds by investment banks to

US citizens, with the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring US investment banks to take measures

'reasonably designed to preclude distribution or redistribution of the securities, within, or to nationals of, the

United States'. However, there is currently no law preventing US citizens purchasing Eurobonds on their own

initiative, although they would clearly be expected to reveal any coupon earnings in their tax declaration.

!e private placements rule 144A permits sophisticated US financial institutions to hold Eurobonds in their

investment portfolio so long as they are clearly held for investment purposes.

12.14 THE MANAGEMENT OF A EUROBOND ISSUE

A typical Eurobond issue involves the formation of three groups: (i) the management group, (ii) the

underwriting syndicate and (iii) the selling group. !e issue is handled on behalf of a client by a lead or

managing bank, and where the deal involves a particularly large sum of money other co-managers may be

appointed. !e lead manager and co-managers together form the management group. !e borrower and the

lead bank will have initial discussions concerning the currency of issue, the amount and terms at which the

borrower would like to raise funds. !e next stage involves appointing an underwriting syndicate of typically

between 10 and 200 banks/securities houses to underwrite the issue so that the issuer is guaranteed the funds.

!e underwriting group which also includes the banks from the management group has the additional task of

307

International Finance

assisting in the placing of the issue with Eurobond investors. A final group, which comprises the management

group and the underwriting syndicate plus other selected banks, form the selling group whose task is to place

the issue with Eurobond investors.

A typical Eurobond issue is partly placed with institutional investors and partly with private investors, with

the latter usually accounting for around a half of the value of the issue. A few weeks or sometimes days prior

to an issue being placed on the market a 'red herring' prospectus is issued that sets out the likely features of

the bond which is used by the selling group to canvass interest in the issue. In some cases, the bond trades in a

'grey market' which is a short-term forward market that gives prospective investors an opportunity to see the

likely trading range for the market price of the issue. !e selling group, on the basis of feedback from potential

investors, will return to the issuer to 'fine tune' the issue, adjusting the final terms so as to meet some of the

prospective investors' demands. Once the terms of the issue are finalized, the selling group will commit itself

to buying the entire issue at a discount to the offer price and a final prospectus is printed and distributed to

potential investors.

Competition between members of the selling group is fierce and it may well be the case that different investors

are able to buy the bonds at different prices, o(en at a discount to the offer price stated in the prospectus. Lead

managers are expected to ensure, using their own funds if necessary, an orderly primary and secondary market

in the issue; failure to do so would adversely affect their reputation in the Eurobond market. Unlike domestic

bond markets, the secondary market in Eurobonds is relatively 'thin' and most Eurobond investors tend to hold

the issue right through to maturity. Nonetheless, for some of the very large issues with well-known issuers,

the secondary market can be reasonably active, and Eurobond market-makers quote bid–offer prices. !e

bid–offer spread in the Eurobond market can typically range from 30 to 50 basis points, which contrasts with

the spread for US Treasury bonds which, because of the greater liquidity, is typically less than 5 basis points.

!e lead bank and the underwriting syndicate charge the client for both managing, placing and underwriting

the issue. On occasions, the underwriting syndicate will actually purchase part or all of the issue and then

hopefully place it with clients at a higher price and thus make a profit. A typical fee structure involves 20%

- f fees going to the management group, 20% to the underwriting group and 60% to the selling group. !e
fees and precise proportions between the groups are variable depending upon how complex the issue is, the

credit rating of the issuer and how easy the issue is to place with investors. !e total fee as a percentage of the

value of the issue is usually in the range of 0.5 to 2% depending upon the complexity and degree of di'culty

- f placing the issue. Competition for Eurobond business is extremely fierce, particularly as banks are keen to
appear highly placed in the Eurobond league tables, such as the one shown in Table 12.4. In some Eurobond
issues the management group may even confine all three tasks to itself so as to maximize its fee earnings.

12.15 INNOVATIONS IN THE EUROBOND MARKET

!e first Eurobond issues were in the form of 'straights', that is, borrowing at a fixed rate of interest; but the

market has since developed so that many Eurobond issues now have innovative features. !ese days a good

proportion (around a quarter) of Eurobond issues are $oating-rate notes; and another major innovation is

that many recent Eurobond issues are denominated in the euro.

Other innovations include the issue of convertible Eurobonds whereby the investor has the right to convert

the bond into shares in the company at a predetermined price. Some Eurobonds are issued with warrants

attached which can be traded separately, giving the holder the right to buy shares at a predetermined price.

Many Eurobond issues also have a 'call-back' feature which enables the issuer to buy back the issue should it

wish to do so (a particularly useful feature if the borrower's cash $ow turns out to be better than expected or

if interest rates decline su'ciently). More recently, in some Eurobond issues the principal to be returned to

the investor is linked to movements in a broad equity market index such as the Nikkei 225. Another recent

innovation is asset-backed Eurobonds; with these, illiquid assets such as the outstanding loans of a bank are

sold in the form of a Eurobond promising to pay a given coupon based on the income from the outstanding

loans. Such bonds can still have a AAA rating because the bond will typically be over-collateralized, that is,

backed up by loans with a face value considerably higher than that of the bond, so, even if allowance is made

for default on some of the outstanding loans, the Eurobond investor can expect to receive full payment.

In recent years, the Eurobond market has been opened up to governments from so-called emerging markets

such as Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, South Africa, China, Poland and South Korea. Some of the high-risk

countries such as Brazil and Mexico may at times need to pay 500 basis points or more above the equivalent

US Treasury bond rates, while other emerging countries such as China, Poland and South Africa can get away

with borrowing at a spread of 150 basis points or less. In many ways, the Eurobond market has the potential

to provide a valuable source of funding for emerging-market governments, although such borrowers are of a

higher risk than traditional Eurobond borrowers.

All of these innovative features, as well as the fact that interest is paid once a year and that the liquidity of

Eurobonds is lower compared to Treasury bonds, make it quite di'cult to compare the yields on Eurobonds

with standard Treasury and corporate bonds. Nonetheless, a typical Eurobond offers a premium over the

standard Treasury bond of between 30 to 150 basis points depending on the credit rating of the issuer. More

importantly, from the viewpoint of the issuer the typical cost savings of a Eurobond issue compared to a

domestic bond issue can range from 25 to 200 basis points.

12.16 CONCLUSIONS

!e growth of parallel money markets such as the eurocurrency markets has made the process of monetary

control more di'cult for central banks, in stark contrast to the days when they themselves were the main

source of liquidity for banks short of funds. Up to the early 1960s any shortage of liquidity by banks would

309

International Finance

have led to heavy calls for funds in the money market, and the central bank could then charge a high rate

- f interest in its capacity of lender of last resort. !ese days, if banks are short of funds they have plenty of
alternatives other than the central bank, such as the interbank market and the eurocurrency markets. !is
diminishing importance of the central bank is re$ected in the fact that financial institutions increasingly use
LIBOR as the key reference rate of interest, rather than Treasury Bill rates or central-bank lending rates.

Nonetheless, central banks still maintain a very high degree of in$uence over short-term interest rates

through open market operations. Indeed, if a central bank decides to create a general shortage of funds

through large Treasury bill sales this is bound eventually to filter through to the other markets. !e rates of

interest in the eurocurrency and offshore markets are ultimately linked to the domestic markets of the relevant

eurocurrency. For example, if the US Federal Reserve sells Treasury bills, and short-term interest rates rise in

the USA, then eurobanks will find that they need to raise their eurodollar interest rates in order to prevent a

seepage of funds back to the US market. Conversely, if the Federal Reserve conducts an expansionary open

market operation, purchasing Treasury bills and so lowering the US interest rate, there will then be a seepage

- f funds into the euromarkets and eurobanks will find they are able to raise dollar funds at a lower cost, so
lowering the eurodollar rates.

!e growth of eurobanking activity has been blamed for many things, ranging from the breakdown of the

Bretton Woods system, to the rise in worldwide in$ation and the debt crisis in the developing world. In reality,

the eurobanks provide services that are clearly in demand as is verified by their rapid growth. In particular,

their competitive deposit and lending rates prove to be attractive for both investors and borrowers of funds.

Eurobanks have been largely responsible for the increased degree of financial integration between economies

and they perform a particularly important role in recycling funds from surplus to deficit companies and

countries. While this increased financial integration has made monetary control more di'cult for domestic

authorities, it must be concluded that the euromarkets themselves have not had a significant in$ationary

impact upon the world economy. Although a switch from domestic to eurodeposits may free some reserves

for additional lending, the overall effect on liquidity is not particularly significant and is not necessarily

undesirable.

In the end, it is clear that eurobanks have not had a harmful effect on the way economies work, and their

- verall macroeconomic importance has frequently been exaggerated. Many of the transactions carried out
by eurobanks would be undertaken in their absence by domestic banks, only less e'ciently so. Eurobanks
have expanded rapidly partly because the demand for their services has expanded with the increased degree

- f trade among nations. Much of this business has ultimately gone to eurobanks rather than domestic banks
because they have a competitive advantage in the provision of the requisite banking services.

!e Eurobond market is constantly evolving and innovating to meet the changing preferences of both

borrowers and investors of funds. Today, Eurobonds come in a huge variety of different forms, varying in

the credit rating of the issuer, the maturity of the issue, the liquidity of the secondary market, the currency

- f denomination, whether of a fixed or variable rate, and in other specific features. !is makes comparing
different Eurobonds a complex issue. !e bond market is constantly evolving and innovating to meet the
changing preferences of both borrowers and investors of funds. !ese days, with the abolition of exchange
rate controls the domestic capital market is in fierce competition with other markets such as the Eurobond
market to attract scarce international capital. !e Eurobond market has the advantage of lower regulatory
requirements which reduces borrowing costs for issuers and allows for more innovative features to be
introduced compared with a domestic bond issue.
