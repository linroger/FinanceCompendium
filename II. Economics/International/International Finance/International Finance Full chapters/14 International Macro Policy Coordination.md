## 14.1 Introduction

For the majority of this text, we have confined our analysis to the study of a small open economy. By definition

the policy measures taken by such an economy have no significant impact upon its trading partners. The small

economy assumption is useful in that it makes it plausible to ignore possible reactions to its policies from

trading partners. In the real world, however, the actions taken by one country will often have significant effects

upon its trading partners. This means that the countries are interdependent and policy measures adopted by

one of the economies may provoke a reaction from its trading partners that can reinforce, weaken or even

offset its policy. Where such interdependence exists it is frequently argued that countries should consider

coordinating their macroeconomic policies to avert the possibility of conflict and improve their positions as

compared to pursuing unilateral policies.

In this chapter, we shall look at some of the major issues raised by the topic of international macroeconomic

policy coordination. These issues include: what is meant by coordination of economic policies? Why does the

need for international policy coordination arise? Is coordination always superior to non-coordination? What

are the obstacles that prevent greater international coordination?

## 14.2 What is Meant by International Policy Coordination?

'International policy coordination' is a very loose term and is sometimes used interchangeably with the word

cooperation – the proper distinction between the two terms is not clearly defined in the literature. Perhaps the

most useful distinction is that made by Henry Wallich (1984, p. 85):

'Cooperation' falls well short of 'coordination', a concept which implies a significant modification of

national policies in recognition of international economic interdependence … But 'cooperation' is more

than 'consultation', which may mean little more than that other interested parties will be kept informed.

International Finance

Notwithstanding this distinction, we shall use the term 'coordination' throughout this chapter, although the

lower levels of coordination such as the exchange of information might be considered more appropriately as

examples of cooperation.

International policy coordination is primarily about some form of cooperative relationship between the

policy-makers/authorities of two or more nations. Thus, international policy coordination does not directly

involve the private sector _per se_. As we shall see, this latter point is important because an arrangement made

between national authorities might be undermined by a suspicious private sector. To provide an operational

framework for the discussion we shall distinguish between a hierarchy of three types of coordination: the

exchange of information; the acceptance of mutually consistent policies; and joint action.

_The exchange of information_

A minimal type of coordination is the exchange of information between the authorities of two or more

countries. !is exchange may be on a limited or quite considerable scale. !e type of information that might

be exchanged includes the authorities' views about the appropriate value of the exchange rate, the present and

future course of their domestic macroeconomic policies and intentions with regard to future exchange market

intervention, economic forecasts and principal objectives of economic policies, and so on. !e exchange of

information will not by itself lead to agreement on what are the appropriate macroeconomic policies, let

alone joint action. As such, it represents a minimal level of coordination. What it is likely to lead to is a better

understanding of how con$ict can be averted and where the greatest uncertainty lies.

_Mutually consistent policies_

!e exchange of information may provide the basis for more active coordination in that the countries concerned

accept either formally or informally to adopt consistent macroeconomic policy stances. Each country takes

into account the aims and policies of other countries when formulating its own policy stance. Coordination

at this level means the authorities pursue mutually compatible target values and adjust the selection of policy

instruments, their magnitude and timing to avoid con$ict with other countries. Such coordination requires an

exchange of information with other countries and that account be taken of the policies and objectives being

pursued in those other countries.

_Joint action_

Having exchanged information and agreed on mutually consistent target values for the objectives of

economic policy, the authorities of the two economies could go one step further and agree on joint action to

achieve desired targets. For example, if a certain value of the real exchange rate is required to achieve these

- bjectives, joint action would mean that the two authorities act together to manipulate the exchange rate in
the desired direction. Joint action means not only an agreement on the appropriate exchange rate value, but
also concerted action to achieve that rate. As we shall see, much of the recent literature on macroeconomic
policy) coordination) has focused mainly on two types of joint action. One is when fiscal and monetary
policies)are adjusted to maximize joint welfare, the other is when the exchange rate is jointly targeted. Some
proposals for policy coordination combine fiscal and monetary policies with some form of exchange rate
targeting.

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

## 14.3 Why Does the Need for International Policy Coordination Arise?

Coordination of macroeconomic and exchange rate policies would not be necessary if exchange rate changes

truly insulated one country from another, as advocates of $oating exchange rates had presupposed. In such

circumstances, one economy would not be affected by the policy mix pursued in other economies. Experience

with $oating exchange rates has amply demonstrated that such independence does not exist. In particular,

the phenomenon of exchange rate 'overshooting' (see Chapter 7) means that the monetary policy pursued

in one country will have spillover effects on its trading partners. An initial money expansion will lead to a

depreciation of the expanding country's real exchange rate, conferring on it a competitive advantage. However,

the real exchange rate of its trading partners will have appreciated, reducing their exports and thereby their

income and employment levels.

Economic policy coordination is only necessary if economic policies themselves have effects upon the real

economy. If monetary and fiscal policies have no effect on employment and output levels, as some theorists

argue, then there would be no benefits to be derived from international coordination of such policies. As

Alfred Steinherr (1984, p. 77) puts it:

In a world where markets for all possible trades exist ('completeness of markets'), where all markets,

including the labour market, are competitive and all prices fully $exible, where all agents are rational

and adjustment costs of pricing and input decisions negligible there is no need for adjustment policies,

and therefore no need for co-ordination. Each economy would then adjust instantaneously to any

surprises ('shocks') and operate at its natural employment level and there would be no overshooting

  - f the exchange rate. !us the need for policy coordination may from this angle be regarded as due to
market imperfections. According to this view reduction of imperfections would reduce the need for
policy intervention and coordination, and act as a substitute for coordination. Needless to say, not all
imperfections can be eliminated in the real world. As a consequence policies can potentially improve
the market outcome and, in interdependent economies, produce spillover effects.

Frenkel (1983) points out that spillover effects that give rise to the need for coordination are the result of two

important linkages between the domestic economy and the rest of the world. In the first instance, countries

are connected via trade $ows: the exports of one country are the imports of another and vice versa. Changes

in these volumes will affect the national incomes of the countries concerned and with it employment levels.

!e second vital linkage is that provided by international capital movements: these permit the transmission

- f economic disturbances from one economy to another by freeing an economy from the need to keep its
current account in balance. In this way, policies that in$uence the current account position of a country will
have spillover effects on its trading partners' current account positions. Capital movements also have the effect

- f tying international interest rate differentials and expected exchange rate changes via the UIP condition.
As such, policies that in$uence the domestic interest rate will have effects on trading partners via induced
changes in the real exchange rate.

In effect, the need for coordination is derived from spillover effects associated with interdependence.

Cooper (1985) defines structural interdependence as a situation whereby the structures of two or more

economies are such that economic events in one significantly in$uence economic events in the other(s).

Hence, if economic policies adopted in one country affect its real economy then they will also have spillover

effects on other countries. In such circumstances, the optimal course of action for one country will depend

upon the course of action taken by other countries. Interdependence means that a country cannot achieve its

345

International Finance

- bjectives without these being mutually consistent with those pursued by other countries. Furthermore, the
resulting policy interdependence means that a country has to take into account the policies of other countries.
!is implies the need for a certain degree of international policy coordination if countries wish to achieve
their objectives. !e need is especially acute where the trade and capital linkages are high, such as those which
exist between the European Union member states.

As an illustration of the interdependence between economies, Table 14.1 presents the results of the

effects)of)monetary and fiscal expansion by the USA and non-US OECD countries according to a variety of

well-known models of the international economy (this approach is further discussed later in the chapter in

**section 14.8** ).

## 14.4 The Benefits from International Policy Coordination

When one talks about the benefits to be derived from international policy coordination these will be dependent

upon the type and degree of coordination undertaken. In general terms, coordination is a means of preserving

and improving the benefits associated with increased interdependence, such as the gains from trade and

access to international capital markets.

!e potential gains from coordination of macroeconomic policies internationally have been conceptually

illustrated by Hamada (1974, 1976, 1985) using what has become known as the Hamada diagram. !e

principles underlying the derivation of the Hamada diagram for the hypothetical case of Europe and America

are shown in Figure 14.1.

In the Hamada diagram, the macropolicy configuration of Europe is shown on the horizontal axis,

while that of America is shown on the vertical axis. For instance, as we move along the horizontal axis the

346

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

macropolicy stance of Europe may be more expansionary, and likewise as we move up the vertical axis for

America. Because the two countries are interdependent the optimal policy stance for Europe is dependent

upon the policy stance taken by America, and vice versa.

Conceptually, there must be a point on the diagram for Europe that gives a combination of its own policy

stance and that of America which it prefers to all other possible policy combinations. !is point of bliss for

Europe is given by point _E_ *. Likewise, for America there must be a combination of its own policy and that of

Europe that it prefers to all other policy combinations; this is given by point _A_ *.

_U_ and _U_

For both Europe and America we can draw sets of elliptically shaped indifference curves E A

that denote combinations of European and American policies that yield the same level of utility. From the

_U_ to

viewpoint of Europe, the closer the policy configuration of the two economies puts it on a utility curve E

point _E_ - the better off it is. Hence, a combined policy configuration that puts it on utility curve _U_ E1 is preferred

to _U_

E2. Similarly, from the viewpoint of America, the closer the policy configuration of the two countries puts

it on a utility curve to point _A_ *, the better off it is. A combined policy configuration that puts it on utility

curve _U_ A1 is preferred to _U_ A2. In the special case, where the two countries are totally independent, the utility

curves for Europe are vertical straight lines and those for America are horizontal straight lines. Each country

could then achieve its optimal level of welfare merely by adjusting its own policy instruments, regardless of

the policy pursued by the other country.

!e problem for each economy is to determine its optimal policy stance for any given policy stance of the

- ther; this yields a policy reaction schedule for each economy. !e policy reaction schedule for Europe is
found by taking a given policy stance of America and finding a utility curve _U_ E which is tangential to it: this is
the utility closest to point _E_ *, which means Europe adopts policy stance _E_ 1 when the USA is pursuing policy

_A_

1. One can find various other optimal policy stances of Europe given a different policy stance by America,
and by joining the points together one obtains the policy reaction function of Europe as _R_ E. Similarly, the
policy reaction schedule for America is found by taking a given policy stance of Europe such as _E_ 1 and finding
a utility curve _U_ A2 which is tangential to a vertical line from _E_ 1. !is is the utility curve closest to point _A_ which means America's best policy stance is _A_ 2. In a like manner, one can find various other optimal policy
stances of America given a different policy stance by Europe, and by joining the points together one obtains
the policy reaction function of America as _R_ A.

!e locus of points passing between _E_ [*] and _A_ [*], where the utility curves _U_ E and _U_ A are tangential to one

another, is known as the pareto contract curve. Since the indifference curves are tangential to one another

along the contract curve this indicates that one country can be made better off only by making the other

country worse off. In the region of the contract curve between _E_ [*] and _A_ [*] the closer we are to point _E_ - (the

further from point _A_ *) the better off is Europe and the worse off is America. Conversely, the closer we are to

point _A_ - (the further from point _E_ *) the better off is America and the worse off is Europe. Note that the utility

curves are drawn as oval-shaped ellipses, with the level of utility falling the further an oval-shaped curve is

from the country's preferred point.

We can now use the Hamada diagram to illustrate the potential gains from the coordination of macropolicies

between the two economies. !is is illustrated in Figure 14.2.

To establish potential gains from international macropolicy coordination it is necessary to compare the

possible situation under coordination vis-à-vis a scenario of non-coordination. !e problem is that there is

a range of possible coordination scenarios, and likewise one could also envisage a range of non-coordination

scenarios. Figure 14.2 compares possible coordination scenarios with two popular non-coordination scenarios

known as Nash and Stackleberg equilibriums.

In the Nash non-cooperative scenario each economy takes the policy stance of its partner economy as

beyond its in$uence and adopts its optimal isolationist policy in this belief. If Europe pursues policy _E_ 1, the

- ptimal policy for America is _A_ 1, but given this the optimal policy for Europe is then _E_ 2, and given this the
- ptimal policy for America is _A_ 2, and so on. !e economies continue to interact in this manner despite the
fact that each economy's policy strategy choice does in$uence the choice of the other. A Nash equilibrium is
finally reached when there is no incentive for either economy to change its policy stance, taking the other's
policy as given. In the Hamada diagram the Nash equilibrium is given by point N where the two reaction
schedules intersect. At point N there is no incentive for either economy to change its policies. America is on
utility curve _U_ AN while Europe is on utility curve _U_ EN.

With the Stackleberg scenario, one of the two countries (the leader) is assumed to be more intelligent

than in the Nash scenario and realizes that its policy stance in$uences the choice of the other country, while

the other (the follower) ignores the in$uence of its policy stance on the leader. Consequently, the leader

anticipates possible rational reactions of the follower when making its policy choice. In Figure 14.2 we assume

that America is the leader, and this leads to a Stackleberg equilibrium at point S. At point S there is a utility

curve _U_ AS that is just tangential to Europe's reaction schedule _R_ E. !is is the closest indifference curve to point

_A_ - that America can reach knowing the whole range of possible reactions of Europe. With America pursuing

Stackleberg policy AS the best policy for Europe is _E_ 1.

When comparing the Nash and Stackleberg non-cooperative equilibriums the Stackleberg solution is

certainly superior for the leader compared to the Nash solution, and may or may not prove superior to the

Nash solution for the follower. However, both the non-cooperative scenarios are pareto-ine'cient since they

do not lie on the contract curve _E_ - _A_ *. In theory, both economies could agree to adopt policy combinations

that make them both better off compared to either the Nash or Stackleberg non-cooperative scenarios. For

example, between the portion ab on the contract curve _A_ - _E_ - both countries would be on higher utility curves

compared to the Stackleberg scenario. Hence, with coordination of economic policies the level of welfare for

348

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

both economies can be raised as compared to non-coordination. If the economies agree to coordinate to get

- nto the contract curve, the precise position they get to depends upon their relative bargaining strengths. !e
stronger the relative bargaining power of Europe the closer the position on the contract curve it will be to
point _E_ *, while the stronger the bargaining position of America the closer the solution on the contract curve
will be to _A_ *.

In passing, we note that if both countries were to try to become a Stackleberg leader a situation known as

'Stackleberg warfare' would break out; this has no equilibrium solution because the assumptions each country

makes are mutually inconsistent. Another important point made by Currie (1990) is that international

macroeconomic policy does not require that the two countries' governments have the same objectives or even

the same set of preferences. Indeed, this point is illustrated in the Hamada diagram where the two countries'

governments have different points of bliss.

## 14.5 A Game Theory Demonstration of the Gains from Coordination

!e Stackleberg and Nash solutions illustrated by the Hamada diagram are demonstrations of the results of

traditional game theory. Simple game theory is usually presented as a pay-off matrix, an example of which is

set out in Figure 14.3.

!e figure depicts what is known in game theory as a pay-off matrix. We assume that the pay-off to each

economy is measured by a 'misery index', which is simply the sum of an economy's in$ation and unemployment

rates. For simplicity of exposition we shall assume that policy-makers regard an additional 1% of in$ation to

be equally as bad as an additional 1% of unemployment. !is being the case, the aim of economic policy will

be to minimize an economy's misery index. !e first of each of the two numbers separated by a comma is the

misery index (pay-off) of Europe, while the second is the pay-off of America. For example, if Europe pursues

policy 1 and America pursues policy 4, the result will be a misery index of 7 for Europe and 15 for America.

Similarly, if Europe pursues policy 2 while America pursues policy 3, the pay-off will be a misery index of 15

for Europe and 6 for America.

Using the pay-off matrix it is straightforward to illustrate the potential gains from the coordination of

policies. Suppose that each economy seeks to minimize its misery index but chooses its policy package in

isolation without any coordination. When deciding whether or not to pursue policy 1 or policy 2, Europe

does not know what policy will be chosen by America. Hence, the authorities of Europe will consider the

consequences if America pursues either policy 3 or policy 4. If America were to pursue policy 3, the best

policy for Europe is policy 1, which gives it a misery index of 12 compared to 15 if it pursued policy 2. If

America were to pursue policy 4, the best policy for Europe is, again, policy 1, which gives it a misery index

- f 7 compared to a misery index of 8 were it to employ policy 2. Hence, no matter what policy is chosen by
America, the best isolationist policy for Europe is to pursue policy 1. An analogous set of reasoning applies
to the policy choice of America. If Europe pursues policy 1, the best policy for America is policy 3, giving a
misery index of 12 compared to 15 if it pursues policy 4. Likewise, if Europe pursues policy 2 the best policy
for America is, again, policy 3, which gives a misery index of 6 as opposed to 8 if it pursues policy 4. Hence,
no matter what policy is chosen by Europe, the best isolationist policy for America to pursue is policy 3.

!e result of each making its policy decisions in isolation is that Europe pursues policy 1 while America

pursues policy 3. !e resulting misery index for both economies is 12. !is non-cooperation scenario is worse

for both economies than if they were to engage in cooperation. By cooperation Europe could agree to pursue

policy 2 and America agree to pursue policy 4. !is policy configuration gives both countries a misery index

- f only 8, which is superior to the 12 of acting in isolation.

One of the problems for such cooperative agreements is that once there is an agreement there may

be incentives for one or more parties to renege on the agreement. Suppose Europe and America agree to

cooperate)and pursue policies 2 and 4 respectively. If Europe is sure that America will adopt the agreed

policy)4)then the best policy for Europe to pursue is not policy 2 to which it agreed, but rather policy 1.

Similarly, if America is sure that Europe will pursue policy 2 then the best policy for it to pursue is policy)3

rather than policy 4. Hence, it is possible that cooperative agreements will be undermined at times by the

reneging of one or more parties to the agreement. As such, there may need to be stiff penalties against parties

that renege and a monitoring system designed to spot any reneging country.

14.6 OTHER POTENTIAL BENEFITS FROM COORDINATION

!e Hamada diagram and pay-off matrix illustrations provide simple demonstrations of the potential gains

to be had from international policy coordination. However, the analysis is simple in that each country is

assumed to know the range of potential policies that the other country could pursue and can also calculate the

consequences of various policy combinations on its own welfare. In the real world we can expect some gains

from coordination that are not well-illustrated by traditional game theory. !ese include:

 - **Reduction of uncertainty.** One of the major benefits to be expected from cooperation is that it
should help to reduce the uncertainty element associated with the implementation of policy. When
economies are interdependent, the course of action that a country should take will be di'cult to
decide in isolation because the optimal policy will depend upon the policy actions of others. In
the real world a country rarely knows the course of action that will be taken by other economies
and their probable reactions to changes in its own policy stance. Coordination has the potential to
reduce the possibility of serious con$ict. An exchange of information improves the information set
available to the authorities, enabling them to pursue superior policies than could be pursued without
such information. In the absence of an information exchange, there may be serious shortcomings in
policy design, particularly with regard to miscalculation about the reactions of foreign authorities.
Such errors could prove very costly in today’s interdependent economies. Furthermore, the reduced
possibility of con$ict will improve the environment in which international trade is conducted.

 - **Coordination may avoid excessive deflation.** Oudiz and Sachs (1985) point out that coordination
may prove crucial to improving welfare when the foreign exchange market is forward-looking. One
way that authorities may be tempted to control in$ation in isolation is to announce today that money
supply growth will be lower in the future. If such an announcement is believed, the authorities of that

350

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

country will benefit from an immediate real appreciation of their currency, reducing present in$ation.

!e other country, however, will experience a real depreciation of its currency giving a boost to its

in$ation rate. In the absence of coordination both countries may be tempted to engage in competitive

announcements of intentions to control future monetary growth. Only a coordination agreement

between the two countries to avoid such a competitive manipulation of the exchange rate can remove

the danger of excessive de$ation.

14.7 THE POTENTIAL FOR COORDINATION TO MAKE COUNTRIES WORSE OFF

!ere is an intuitive inclination to believe that international policy cooperation must improve the welfare of

each of the countries involved and thereby global welfare as compared to non-coordination scenarios. !is

intuition runs as follows. Since at worst countries could cooperatively agree to pursue similar policies as in a

non–coordination scenario, then the policies they choose under coordination must be superior or they would

have pursued the non-cooperative policies. However, the literature has shown that this is not necessarily

the case. !ere are three instances in which coordination between two or more countries may make the

participating countries worse off rather than better off. One involves an unfavourable reaction by private

agents to coordination between authorities; another involves an unfavourable reaction by a third country to

coordination between a subset of countries; a final instance involves coordination making countries worse off

because the policies pursued are based on the wrong economic model.

_The reaction of private agents_

Kenneth Rogoff (1985) pointed out that coordination between national authorities is only potentially superior

to non-coordination because it is necessary to take into account the reaction of the private sector. !e basic

argument put forward by Rogoff is that the behaviour of private agents cannot be considered by the authorities

as indifferent to any arrangements that they come to with trading partners. Rogoff argues that an adverse

reaction by private agents to a cooperative arrangement between national authorities can make things worse

rather than better.

Specifically, Rogoff considers the case where national authorities seek to raise the level of employment in

their economies in a model in which there is exchange rate overshooting. Acting in isolation, each country

resists the temptation to in$ate because they realize that this will lead to a real depreciation of their currencies

which will raise import costs and lead to a quick upward adjustment to domestic wages and prices. If, however,

the central banks come to an agreement to in$ate together to raise employment levels, they can overcome the

fear of a depreciation of their real exchange rate. !is means that with coordination the incentives to in$ate

are greater. Rogoff argues that rational private agents will take this additional in$ation risk into account when

setting their wage contracts and raise their wage demands accordingly. In such circumstances, the authorities

may face a higher average in$ation rate in a coordination regime than acting in isolation.

!e possibility that coordination between authorities may lead to a deterioration in global welfare stems

from a credibility problem vis-à-vis the private sector. Rogoff suggests that one way to remove this adverse

risk of policy coordination is for the coordinating governments to make institutional changes to improve

their credibility, such as making their central banks independent with a statute committing them to price

stability (low in$ation). !is would then remove private agents' mistrust of the authorities, enabling them to

coordinate to improve their economic welfare.

351

_The reaction of a third country_

It is conceivable that cooperation between two or more countries that would ordinarily raise their joint welfare

could provoke an adverse reaction by a third country. If such a reaction has a significant negative impact on

the coordinating countries then it is possible that the cooperating countries end up worse-off. For example,

Europe and America might decide to de$ate their economies in their joint interest, but because of the adverse

effects for Japanese exports this may lead Japan to de$ate its economy which then exacerbates the recession

in America and Europe above what they anticipated, making them worse-off than if they had not agreed to

joint de$ation.

_Cooperation based on the wrong model_

Frankel and Rockett (1988) argue that cooperation may prove inferior to non-cooperation due to the presence

- f uncertainty over the true economic model. In a world of uncertainty, the structural parameters and linkages
between economies as well as the relationship between instruments and targets are not known for sure.
Given this, it is possible that, if countries agree to coordinate their monetary and fiscal policies based on
particular models of their economies, and the model(s) used turn out to be the wrong model(s), the agreed
cooperative policies may be seriously defective and make one or both countries worse-off as compared to
non-coordination. !e results of the Frankel and Rockett study are considered more fully in the following

section.

14.8 ESTIMATES OF THE BENEFITS AND LOSSES FROM INTERNATIONAL POLICY

COORDINATION

While it is practically impossible to measure the benefits or losses from international policy coordination in

the real world, because of the perennial problem of estimating what would have happened in the absence of

coordination, this has not prevented a number of researchers using economic models to make simulation

estimates of the potential gains/losses associated with international macroeconomic policy coordination. One

- f the most interesting studies is that carried out by Frankel and Rockett (1988).

To estimate the potential benefits from international policy coordination Frankel and Rockett used ten

different economic models, as listed in Table 14.1. !ese models are representative of a variety of economic

methodologies ranging from detailed large-scale structural models to more reduced-form models of

economies. !e models re$etc a spectrum of Keynesian, monetarist and neoclassical schools of economic

thought.

!e basic methodology used by Frankel and Rockett is as follows. Each government is assumed to believe

that one of the ten models is the correct economic model and may or may not be correct in that assumption.

For example, two possible scenarios are that the US may believe in the MCM model, while Europe believes

in the OECD model; or the US may believe in the OECD model while Europe believes in the EEC model.

In some cases, the two countries may believe in the same model. Each country agrees to coordinate with the

- ther country to maximize their perceived joint welfare as compared to the perceived Nash non-cooperative
- utcome. In total there are 100 coordination scenarios to examine, because for each of the ten models that the
USA might believe in, there are ten alternative models that the Europeans could use.

For each of the 100 scenarios Frankel and Rockett examine the welfare effects for both the USA and Europe

- f the coordination scenario as compared to the Nash non-cooperation scenario. To measure the potential

welfare gain or loss to each country from coordination under the various scenarios it is necessary to know

what the true model is. For each of the 100 scenarios, Frankel and Rockett examine the welfare gains/losses

to the USA and Europe by assuming in turn that each of the ten models is true. For example, in the scenario

where the USA believes in the MCM model and Europe believes in the OECD model, the potential gains/

losses in welfare to each of the two parties are examined by assuming that in turn the MCM model is true,

then the EEC model is true, then the EPA model is true, and so on. !is means that there are 100 times 10,

that is, 1,000 possible welfare gain/loss scenarios for each country to examine.

Frankel and Rockett discover that out of the 1,000 possible combinations of coordination between the

two economies, US welfare was improved in 546 cases, while it ended up worse-off in 321 cases, with its

welfare unchanged in 133 cases. Europe's welfare was improved in 539 cases, while it ended up worse-off in

327 cases, with its welfare unchanged in 134 cases. Hence, although on balance a country is likely to gain

from coordination, there remains a very significant chance (approximately 32%) that it will end up worse-off,

because coordination has been based upon the wrong economic model. Even these results are slightly biased

in favour of coordination because, in instances where at least one of the countries is using the correct model,

coordination is bound to be beneficial to that country or it would not have agreed to coordinate. By excluding

such cases there are 810 combinations where neither country is correct. In these cases, the USA has gains in

419 cases, losses in 286 cases and no effect in 105. For Europe there are gains in 408 cases, losses in 298 and

no effect in 104.

Frankel and Rockett recognize that the above methodology may underestimate the case for coordination

because policy-makers do not explicitly take into account the possibility that the model they utilize may be

invalid. If they did take into account the presence of model uncertainty, then the probability of success from

coordination would be significantly raised; a result that is confirmed by Ghosh and Masson (1988). Holtham

and Hughes-Hallett (1987) show that by eliminating instances where one of the countries expects the other

countries to be worse-off according to its model considerably enhances the probability of coordination

raising the welfare of the countries concerned. !ey argue that in practice governments will wish to avoid

circumstances where they benefit and the other country is made worse-off (so-called 'weak bargains') from

coordination because this would encourage the other country to renege and jeopardize future coordination

between the countries.

With regard to the magnitude of gains from international policy coordination, a number of authors such as

Oudiz and Sachs (1984, 1985) and Frankel and Rockett (1988) have shown that the potential welfare gains from

macroeconomic coordination are not very high, even under conditions very favourable to it. !ese conditions

are that both countries use the same model, which is in fact the true one, and that in such circumstances

cooperation must leave both parties better off or they would not cooperate. Oudiz and Sachs (1985) calculate

that, even in the case where the USA, Japan and West Germany coordinated their fiscal and monetary policies

perfectly for the mid-1970s, the gains from coordination were less than 0.5% of GNP for each country. Miller

and Salmon (1985) argue that in the long run there are no gains from international coordination, since in each

country the equilibrium level of output is determined by a vertical Phillips curve and $oating exchange rates

permit the desired level of in$ation to be achieved without the need for international policy coordination.

!ey conclude that 'what gains there may be from coordination must come therefore, in choosing the path

towards equilibrium and not in the final equilibrium'.

Although the gains from international coordination seem to be relatively small, using a somewhat

different methodology can substantially raise the gains from coordination. McKibben and Sachs (1991)

find that monetary policy coordination brings about relatively insignificant gains but a combination of both

monetary and fiscal coordination leads to more significant gains. O(en coordination is brought about because

economies are a%icted by common shocks. Currie et al. (1987) find that while the gains from cooperation are

354

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

small in the case of transitory shocks, the estimated gains rise steeply as the persistence of a shock increases.

In a similar vein, Holtham and Hughes-Hallett (1987) find that the gains from international coordination in

the face of permanent shocks can amount to 4–6% of GDP.

More recently there has been an interest in using the new open-economy macroeconomic (NOEM)

models, which are based upon microeconomic foundations and monopolistic competition with explicit

consumer utility functions to analyse the potential gains to be had from monetary cooperation (see Box 7.2

in Chapter 7). Results obtained from these models are very sensitive to the parameter values assumed and

particular model specification employed. In an early analysis of the issues, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002) found

the gains from monetary policy coordination to be negligible. However, in a recent paper Tchakarov (2004)

finds that the gains from international monetary policy coordination can be as high as 2.2% of steady-state

consumption when different plausible parameter values to those employed by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002) are

used. It seems that the NOEM models are unable to resolve the controversy about the potential benefits from

international policy coordination!

Before concluding this section, it is worth remembering that even if the true model were employed by

coordinating countries, the rules required to achieve fully optimal policy coordination are likely to prove to

be extremely complex, too complex to be implemented in practice. Given this, estimates of the gains from

fully optimal coordination, even though not particularly pronounced, probably need to be treated as generous

estimates of the real-world benefits from coordination. !is critique is particularly applicable to the NOEM

models which require an implausible amount of computational ability on the part of economic agents and

policy-makers.

14.9 PROBLEMS AND OBSTACLES TO INTERNATIONAL POLICY COORDINATION

!e previous section showed that international policy coordination may have a role in raising global welfare,

even though the precise gains will be di'cult to quantify. Indeed, there are plenty of real-world examples

- f countries involving themselves in some form of international coordination – membership of the Bretton
Woods system, the European Monetary Union, the IMF and the OECD are all examples of differing types of
international macroeconomic cooperation and coordination. However, casual observation suggests that the
degree of observed international policy coordination falls far short of the degree of interdependence between
economies. For this reason, we need to consider some of the major obstacles that inhibit greater international
macroeconomic policy coordination.

_Negotiation and reduced flexibility costs_

Once a country decides to try and improve its welfare by engaging in international policy coordination,

an obstacle to it actually achieving a successful coordination package is the negotiation process. Reaching

agreement on a successful international macroeconomic policy stance can prove extremely di'cult and

complex and this complexity will increase exponentially with the number of targets, instruments and countries

involved in the process. In addition, it is di'cult for many governments to pre-commit themselves in areas

such as fiscal policy. !is being the case, international macroeconomic policy coordination is more likely to

yield results when the number of countries is small and objectives are limited. Once a coordination package

is agreed upon, it is likely that policy-makers will find that they have less $exibility and there will be delays

when implementing their policies as they have to obtain agreement from other countries when altering their

policies.

_Disagreement over appropriate macroeconomic policies_

One of the major obstacles to greater coordination is not so much an ignorance on the part of policymakers to the potential benefits to be derived, but rather disagreement over how to realize them. !e

debate in macroeconomics over the role, impact and effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies and major

international policy issues, such as the desirability of fixed and $oating exchange rates, is far from settled,

as reading this book reveals. !is disagreement is not restricted to the quantitative effects of given policy

mixtures but o(en concerns the qualitative aspects. Uncertainty also exists over the appropriate instrument to

employ to achieve a given policy objective. !is uncertainty over means–ends relationships leaves enormous

scope for disagreement between countries that share similar objectives. As Ralph Bryant (1985, p. 216) puts it:

In real-life discussions among national governments, the most fundamental obstacle to more

cooperation is not lack of awareness of the potential gains from coordination. Nor is it merely lack of

political will. To be sure, both those lacunae are important … Yet a still more important obstacle is the

tremendous uncertainty about the magnitudes, and even the signs, of cross-border transmissions of

economic forces.

!e point is that theoreticians who analyse the benefits to be derived from coordination using a game theoretic

approach in which the pay-off matrix is known simplify the obstacles to agreement between policy-makers

who do not know the pay-off matrix or the best policies to pursue to reap the gains from coordination.

Indeed, this lack of agreement over the best policy exists just as much within as between countries. Such

disagreement extends to differences of view over the current state of the economy and what the appropriate

priorities for the economy are.

_Not all countries gain from coordination_

If the pay-off matrix is known and means–ends relationships are fairly clear, it may be possible for policy-makers

to improve their joint welfare by cooperation. However, designing a cooperative policy that maximizes joint

welfare does not necessarily mean that each individual country which is party to the agreement necessarily

gains; it may be the case that some countries are made worse-off when designing a cooperative agreement. In

such circumstances, to make it worthwhile for loser countries to engage in policy cooperation, it is necessary

for some form of compensation to be paid. !is is especially the case if the loser countries are the ones that

have to make the biggest policy adjustments (from which other countries gain). In the real world, examples of

compensation for countries that undertake macroeconomic policies that are beneficial to the rest of the world

but harmful to themselves are di'cult to cite. In practice, this means that cooperative agreements may be

restricted to instances where all countries are made better-off which would accordingly reduce the potential

gains from coordination.

_Reneging and the problem of time consistency_

Another potential problem with policy coordination is derived by using dynamic game theory, and this

highlights the problem of time consistency (see Kyland and Prescott, 1977). A policy is said to be time

inconsistent if there is an incentive to depart from the policy at any time now or in the future. A timeinconsistent coordination arrangement would imply that there are incentives for one or more of the countries

that are party to a coordination package to renege, either in the present or sometime in the future. Using

356

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

advanced game theory, Currie and Levine (1985) have shown that the problem of time consistency can pose

a major threat to coordination. !e reason is that a country which reneges on a time-inconsistent cooperative

agreement may retain an advantage in the long run. Moreover, the threat of retaliation by a partner country

may not be credible because such retaliation would make the retaliating country worse off. An associated

problem is that making a cooperative agreement time consistent may lead to markedly inferior outcomes

compared to a time-inconsistent, fully optimal, cooperative policy. While this may provide a strong incentive

for far-sighted governments not to succumb to the temptation of reneging, Currie and Levine suggest the

need for innovative punishment clauses as part of cooperative agreements to overcome the threat of countries

reneging.

In practice, governments may be very reluctant to renege on coordination agreements and would only

rationally do so if the perceived benefits of reneging exceed the perceived costs. By breaking a cooperative

agreement the authorities may face penalties from other countries and be excluded from future participation

in cooperative agreements. Currie et al. (1987) argue that in practice these costs will comfortably exceed the

benefits, making reneging a fairly rare phenomenon. In a similar vein, Hughes-Hallett (1986) argues that the

risks and associated costs of retaliation against cheating parties are relatively high, while the gains from a

successful cheat are relatively low, making cheating a risky strategy with a negative expected outcome.

14.10 CONCLUSIONS

International policy coordination is very complex, posing new issues for policy-makers that do not arise if

they pursue policies in isolation. !ese issues are so complex that we should not expect coordination to yield

globally optimal solutions. In practice, coordination is likely to remain restricted to certain domains such

as the exchange of information, exchange rate policy and monetary policy, where means–ends relationships

are reasonably clear (avoidance of con$icting policies, preservation of trade $ows and in$ation control) and

the potential gains from coordination are greatest. However, the recent eurozone crisis has shown that fiscal

policy coordination is a necessary ingredient for the successful operation of the zone. Hence the 1996 Stability

and Growth Pact which permitted 3% fiscal deficit to GDP ratios has had to be replaced by the 2012 Fiscal

Compact which seeks balanced budgets.

It is noticeable that cooperation has proved easier in the trade arena with such arrangements as the General

Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (now the World Trade Organization) and the European Union. !ere is a

large consensus in the trade literature that increased trade is beneficial for all countries, which contrasts with

the lack of agreement in the international macroeconomic sphere with arguments over the merits of fixed,

$oating and managed exchange rates and controversy over the role and effectiveness of fiscal and monetary

policy in in$uencing economic activity.

While uncertainty can prove to be a major obstacle to greater international coordination, this should not

be overstated. Uncertainty can at times prove to be an incentive to international coordination: the exchange of

information motivated by the desire to avoid policy con$ict is one of the most common types of coordination

that actually takes place in the real world. In addition, countries have been su'ciently uncertain about the

relative merits of overand undervalued exchange rates that they have not become involved in competitive

exchange rate manipulations. An overvalued exchange rate in relation to PPP has been viewed as advantageous

in the fight against in$ation, while an undervalued rate is viewed as useful in giving a boost to exports and

employment. !is uncertainty may account for the lack of 'exchange rate wars' experienced under $oating

rates despite the major real exchange rate changes that have occurred.

357

International Finance

!e move from fixed to $oating exchange rates has coincided with a decline in the relative economic

in$uence of the United States. !e Bretton Woods system has been analysed as a situation where the US was

the leader and Europe and Japan were followers, as in a Stackleberg scenario. Since the adoption of $oating

exchange rates the relative economic dominance of the US has declined while the economic importance of

Europe and Japan has risen, such that the Stackleberg scenario is no longer an adequate characterization. In

such a tripolar world the dangers of a Nash-type scenario are ever-present, especially given the extra degree

- f freedom associated with $oating exchange rates.

A useful distinction can be made between global and subglobal coordination. Global coordination involves

countries from different regions of the world that have a significant impact on the global economy. !e three

countries that qualify in this category are the United States, Japan and Germany. Subglobal coordination refers

to coordination between countries which are not necessarily important at the global level but have a high

degree of structural interdependence with one another. !e Bretton Woods system represented an example of

global coordination, whereas the European Monetary System and its replacement by the European Monetary

Union represents an example of subglobal coordination. !e move from a US-dominated world to a tripolar

- ne has to date increased the importance of subglobal coordination relative to global coordination, though
there is no obvious reason for this.

!e theoretical and simulation literature has served as a warning that policy-makers should not expect

substantial gains from the coordination of economic policies internationally. Although this message may

sound pessimistic, in many ways it is a re$ection of the increasing scepticism concerning the ability of

governments to in$uence the real economy in a desirable and predictable fashion via manipulation of fiscal

and monetary policies, even in a closed economy framework.
