15.1 INTRODUCTION

On 12 August 1982, the Mexican government announced that it could not meet its forthcoming debt repayments

- n its \$80 billion of outstanding debt to international banks. !is was the first sign of the Latin American debt
crisis. Soon a(er the Mexican announcement, a number of other developing countries announced that they
too were facing severe di'culty in meeting forthcoming repayments. !roughout the 1980s and 1990s and
the early part of the new century the problems faced by developing countries in servicing their debts has been

- ne of the major international policy issues. Granting debt relief has recently also become a major policy issue.

!e debt crisis encompassed a wide set of countries from low-income developing nations to middleincome countries. In this chapter, we concentrate primarily upon four countries that were classified by the

World Bank in its 1994 _World Debt Tables_ as severely indebted middle-income countries (SIMICs), that is,

Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. In its 2004 _Global Development Finance_ _Report_ the World Bank

classification of a SIMIC is that the country must be a middle-income country (an annual income of between

\$725 and \$9,075 per capita) and have one of two key ratios above certain critical levels. !ese ratios are

the present value of debt to gross national income (GNI) (80%) and the present value of debt to exports

- f goods)and services (220%). Other than the SIMICs there are groups classified as: moderately indebted

International Finance

middle-income countries (MIMICs); severely indebted low-income countries (SILICs); moderately indebted

low-income countries (MILICs); and less-indebted middle-income countries (LIMICS). As we shall see, in

2002 only Argentina and Brazil of the four countries we examine remained classified as SIMICs, with Mexico

and Venezuela having shown a marked improvement, resulting in them being listed as LIMICs.

Although they were both severely indebted, there are considerable contrasts between the SIMICs and the

SILICs. !e 15 SIMICs identified by the World Bank in 1994 were especially concentrated in Latin America,

and in 1994 their combined external debt amounted to \$587.4 billion, the majority of which was owed to

private sources made up primarily of commercial banks. By contrast, the majority of the 35 SILICs identified

by the World Bank in 1994 were to be found in sub-Saharan Africa – in 1994 their combined external

debt amounted to \$223.6 billion with the vast majority owed to governments and o'cial agencies and the

remainder to private sources.

!e Latin American debt crisis raised many questions. How did the crisis come about? Why did international

banks lend so much money to these countries? Why did the indebted countries not go into outright default?

How was the debt crisis managed? How successful has the management of the crisis been? What lessons can

be learned from the crisis? In this chapter we examine possible answers to these questions. We will pay special

attention to the debt problems of the four major debtors located in Latin America – Mexico, Argentina, Brazil

and Venezuela. !e concentration of commercial bank loans in these four economies led to fears that if any of

them defaulted, this would undermine the banks that lent to them, especially the US banks that had massive

exposures, and threaten an international financial crisis. !e resulting knock-on effects would push the world

into a major economic recession.

15.2 THE LOWAND MIDDLE-INCOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Developing countries are traditionally distinguished from developed economies by their lower per capita

GNP. However, developed and developing countries are far from homogeneous groups. Developing countries

can be placed into two categories:

 - **Low-income developing countries:** typically with incomes of less than \$735 per capita at 2002 prices,
which includes most of sub-Saharan Africa.

 - **Middle-income developing countries:** this group comprises a very wide range of countries with
incomes in the region of more than \$725 per capita and less than \$9,055 per capita at 2002 prices.
Some of this group can be classified as low-middle-income countries, which includes most countries
in Latin America, with per capita incomes in 2003 being Argentina (\$3,000), Brazil (\$2,700), Mexico
(\$6,100) and Venezuela (\$3,300), and many richer African countries.

15.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF TYPICAL MIDDLE-INCOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Since the debt crisis has been predominately confined to developing countries, especially those in the lowto

middle-income group, some discussion of the main features of such middle-income developing countries is

necessary. Although it is di'cult to generalize, the following represents a list of the main differences between

developed and middle-income less-developed economies:

 - **Financial markets.** !e financial markets in developing countries tend to have a relatively limited
range of investment opportunities for savers and are normally subject to a high degree of government

360

The Latin American Debt Crisis

control. Unlike developed countries that tend to have well-developed stock markets, developing

countries' stock markets can be fairly rudimentary in nature and companies have traditionally

been heavily reliant on banks for funding. Banks are usually either state-owned or subject to heavy

government control aimed at maintaining low real interest rates designed to stimulate investment.

A major problem that results from these low real interest rate policies is that they tend to further

discourage saving which is already low because of low income levels. Low savings combined with low

real interest rates lead to an excess demand for funds, which requires credit rationing. Under credit

rationing the decisions as to which industries can borrow and how much are largely determined

by the government of the day. In addition, the low interest rates stimulate expenditure on imports

contributing to balance of payments problems.

 - **Exchange rate pegging and exchange controls.** !e exchange rates of developing countries are
frequently pegged to the US dollar, the euro or a mixture of currencies, o(en on a 'crawlingpeg' basis. Since developing countries tend to have relatively high in$ation rates, pegging their
currencies against foreign currencies which have lower in$ation rates would be impractical as
they would quickly lose competitiveness. For this reason, they frequently devalue the central
rate against)the currencies to which they are pegged. One of the problems with such crawling
peg arrangements is that if the currency to which they are pegged appreciates, such as the
strong dollar)appreciation between 1980 and 1985, this can prove to be disastrous for the
developing countries' exports. For this reason, some developing countries prefer to peg to a
basket of currencies such as the SDR, that will tend not to appreciate or depreciate as much as an
individual)currency.

In addition to pegging their exchange rates, many developing countries make extensive use of

capital controls, with the central bank applying various restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign

currencies. !ese restrictions serve several purposes as far as the developing countries' governments are

concerned. By restricting the ability of their residents to invest their savings abroad, the controls enable

the government to borrow funds from its residents at a lower rate of interest than would otherwise be the

case. Controls)are)usually)heavily biased against capital out$ows, restricting sales of the home currency and

reducing)the strain on foreign currency reserves which would otherwise be required to defend a pegged

exchange rate.

!e exchange controls normally require that home residents obtain government permission to purchase

foreign currencies. O(en the authorities combine the controls with multiple exchange rate systems, which

means that the authorities may offer a different rate of exchange depending upon the nature of the particular

transaction. For instance, if the foreign currency is required to pay for imports of capital equipment or

essential items, the authorities will usually offer a more favourable rate of exchange than if it is required to pay

for the import of luxury consumption goods. !is is because capital imports and cheap prices for essentials

are considered more favourable to economic development.

 **Low degree of diversification.** !e output of less-developed economies is usually far less diversified
than that of developed countries. Agricultural output can represent a fairly high proportion of
GDP and usually their exports are made up of relatively few commodities, such as raw materials
and agricultural goods. !is means their economic performance can be subject to a wide degree

    - f $uctuation due to bad harvests or changes in the value of their principal exports. !e prices of

primary products produced and exported by developing countries tend to $uctuate far more than

the manufactured products of developed economies. !is price variability means that the incomes

361

International Finance

and trade performances of developing countries can be subject to large year-to-year $uctuations.

Recessions in industrialized countries are especially harmful to developing countries as they

experience both a fall in the price of their primary products and a decline in their export volumes,

meaning large reductions in their export revenues.

 - **Inflationary environment.** !e developing countries tend to have persistent problems with
controlling their in$ation rates. Government budget deficits are frequently financed by the
government resorting to money-creation, partly because the financial markets are too rudimentary to
raise the required borrowing from domestic sources and partly because governments find taxing their
citizens to be politically unpopular and o(en easily evaded. !e resulting in$ation reduces the real
value of money held by domestic residents, constituting an 'in$ation tax', and reduces the real value of

   - utstanding government debt.

 To protect workers' wages from the effects of the in$ationary environment there can be a high degree

    - f wage indexation so that wages rise in line with prices. Wage indexation makes it very di'cult

for the authorities to bring in$ation under control because while they take measures to slow down

future in$ation, wages are being adjusted upwards based on previous in$ation. Indexation also

means that real wages are di'cult to reduce should an economic shock, such as a deterioration in the

country's terms of trade, require such a fall. Consequently, such shocks normally lead to increased

unemployment. A rapidly growing workforce leads to a continuous upward pressure on government

expenditure to provide employment in state enterprises.

15.4 THE ECONOMICS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRY BORROWING

A key question relating to the debt problem is why were the middle-income developing countries eager to

borrow and the commercial banks so willing to supply the funds in the first place? From the perspective of

the developing countries, their combinations of low incomes and poorly developed capital markets mean

that there are insu'cient domestic savings to provide the finance for domestic investment. !eir relatively

low capital stock means that there are plenty of opportunities for profitable investment, and low capital to

labour ratio means that the marginal productivity of capital is high. By borrowing funds from abroad they

can raise domestic investment above domestic savings which in turn leads to a higher rate of economic

growth than in the absence of such borrowing. !e fact that investment then exceeds domestic savings

implies that the country is running a current account deficit, the counterpart of which is the capital in$ow

- n the capital account. Later on, the developing country will have to repay the principal and interest on the
loans extended to it. !e hope is that the state of the economy will be such that repayments should present
no problems.

As for the developed economies, their relatively high incomes and sophisticated financial markets lead

to relatively high savings ratios, while their relatively high capital to labour ratios means that the marginal

productivity of capital is relatively low, restricting the amount of profitable investment opportunities.

!is means that there is an excess of savings looking for appropriate investment opportunities, which

exist in abundance in developing countries who in turn lack the required funds. Hence, there is the

potential) for) profitable exchange between the developed and developing countries. !e developing

countries can utilize the excess savings of the developed countries for investment while the lending

developed countries have higher prospective returns from investing in the developing countries than

domestic investments.

362

The Latin American Debt Crisis

15.5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF CAPITAL INFLOWS INTO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

!ere are a variety of means available for developing countries to attract capital in$ows from the developed

economies to finance new investment:

 - **Bond finance.** !e developing countries' governments can issue bonds to foreign investors with a
guaranteed rate of interest depending upon the maturity date of the bond and whether or not it is
denominated in the domestic or foreign currency. If the bond is issued in the domestic currency it is
subject to 'in$ation risk’ because there is a danger that higher than expected in$ation in the issuing
country could undermine the real redemption value of the bond. Alternatively, if the bond is issued
in a foreign currency it is subject to 'default risk' which is the danger that the developing country will
not be able to redeem the bond.

 - **Bank loans.** !e developing countries can borrow money from the commercial banks of the
developed countries. Such loans are usually made either at fixed or $oating rates of interest and may
be of a shortor long-term nature. During the 1970s and 1980s this was the major source of finance
for the Latin American countries. !e loans extended were predominately ‘syndicated loans’; that is,
loans made by syndicates of international banks. !ese loans were generally made in US dollars at
$oating rates of interest, such that the repayments could be adjusted upwards or downwards in line
with changes in international interest rates. !e key rate of interest for such loans is the dollar LIBOR,
the rate of interest at which banks in London lend dollars to one another. Loans to developing
countries are normally expressed as a margin over dollar LIBOR.

 - **Foreign direct investment.** Another means by which developing countries can raise foreign
finance is by attracting direct foreign investment into the country. Such investment can take many
forms. It could involve a foreign multinational acquiring equity in a domestically owned business,
a multinational expanding an existing subsidiary, or foreign investors setting up a completely new
enterprise in the developing country. Such direct investment is a popular method for multinationals
to invest in developing countries since it gives them both ownership and control over the businesses
that they set up and acquire. In addition, it is regarded as a qualitatively different type of capital
in$ow representing a long-term investment and a vote of confidence in the developing country.

 - **Official finance.** In addition to private sources of foreign investment, the developing countries
are also able to raise money for developmental purposes directly from foreign governments and
international institutions. Loans from foreign governments are o(en made at below market rates

	- f interest to developing countries as part of their foreign-aid programmes, while loans from the
World Bank come at favourable rates of interest because the World Bank has a top credit rating which
enables it to raise large sums of capital from private markets at a lower rate of interest than is possible
for an individual developing country.

Overall, a clear distinction needs to be made between debt finance and equity finance. Debt finance, of

which bond, bank and o'cial finance are examples, requires the debtor to repay the principal and the rate

- f interest attached to the loan whatever the economic situation in the debtor nation. If the country faces a
worsening of its economic circumstances, it must repay the principal and interest on its outstanding debt
regardless. !is contrasts with equity finance whereby the foreign investors either own shares or have direct
control of developing countries' companies. In these cases, the repayment for their investment is in the form

- f profits and dividends and changes in the value of the companies are directly related to the performance
- f the companies and the developing country concerned. If the developing country faces adverse economic

363

International Finance

conditions this will lead to fewer repayments to foreign investors in the form of reduced profits and dividends,

and conversely economic prosperity in the developing country will lead to larger profits and dividend

payments to foreign investors.

15.6 MEASURES OF INDEBTEDNESS

When deciding whether to extend a new loan or to make provisions against existing loans or even whether

to write off parts of their outstanding loans, private banks will want to know the probability of the existing

debt or new loan being repaid. !is will enable them to balance the risk and return elements of the loan. !e

problem is that there is no unique indicator or measure of the burden imposed on a country by its external

indebtedness. In order to assess the risks, banks will have to arrive at a view of the economic and political

state of a country. In arriving at their decision on risks, banks rely on a range of indicators, many of which are

reported by the World Bank in its _Global Development Finance Report_ . Some of the most popular statistics

employed to assess country risk are:

 - **External debt as a percentage of exports of goods and services.** !is expresses the country's
external debt, both private, public and publicly guaranteed, as a ratio of its export earnings. !e idea
is that the export earnings are the means by which the country earns foreign currency to pay off its
debt. Problems with this ratio are that exports may be subject to a high degree of $uctuation from
year to year and there are alternative measures a country can employ to pay off its external debt other
than increasing its export revenues; for example, cutting down import expenditure or running down
its foreign exchange reserves.

 - **Reserves as a percentage of total external debt.** !is is a measure showing the reserves that the
central bank of the debtor nation could in theory use to pay off its external debt.

 - **External debt as a percentage of gross national income.** !is is a measure that gives an idea of the
total debt burden in relation to the GNI of the country. However, it says nothing about the annual
burden imposed on the country, the amount of repayments falling due, or which section of the
community the burden will fall upon.

 - **Total debt service as a percentage of exports of goods and services.** !is measures the public and
publicly guaranteed principal and interest repayments that the country has to make as a percentage

	- f its exports of goods and services. It gives an indication of the annual burden facing a debtor in
relation to its export earnings. !e major problem is the effect of variations in export earnings and
this measure only gives the burden for the particular year under consideration.

 - **Total debt service as a percentage of gross national income.** !is figure measures the public and
publicly guaranteed principal and interest repayments that the country has to make as a percentage

	- f)its GNI.

Of course, other statistics, such as the evolution of the current account, unemployment rates and the rate

- f growth of GDP, are usually taken into account when assessing the risk of lending to a given country.
Other non-economic variables which rely upon judgement are also used, including the likelihood of internal
con$ict, degree of religious con$ict, wealth disparity measures and so forth. It is apparent that no individual
indicator can provide an adequate measure of the complexity of a country's debt problem, and for this reason
the various debt measures are usually weighted to provide a formal index measure of the probability of default.
Nonetheless, there is plenty of scope for assessments to differ depending upon the list of variables chosen and
then the weight attached to each variable.

364

The Latin American Debt Crisis

Even when used in combination, the various measures do not necessarily provide an accurate picture of

the creditworthiness of different countries. !ey neglect factors such as the differing degrees of vulnerability

to external shocks, differing capacities to increase export earnings and differing future economic prospects of

the economies. In addition, there may be a difference between the ability of a country to service its external

- bligations and its willingness to do so, although the two are usually positively correlated. An understanding
- f country-risk assessment is an essential background to the study of the debt crisis because part of the blame
for the crisis is attributable to the inadequacies of the measures used by the banks when extending loans to the
debtor nations in the first instance.

**Box 15.1 Some debt terminology**

Within the context of the international debt crisis, many terms are frequently employed and for this

reason are worth defining:

   - **Public and publicly guaranteed debt** . Most of the loans made to developing countries are
made either directly to the developing country government or to state-owned enterprises, and
such debt is known as public debt. Foreign loans to developing countries are frequently made
to the private sector, but because such lending is regarded as highly risky, it is usually necessary
for the developing country government to guarantee to fulfil the loan contract in the case of
non-payment by the private borrower; this type of obligation is known as publicly guaranteed
debt. !e presence of exchange controls in many developing countries means that their
governments usually get involved in loan agreements between foreign and domestic residents.

   - **Total external debt** . !is is the sum of private non-guaranteed debt and public and publicly
guaranteed debt.

   - **Debt service** . !is is the sum of principal and interest rate repayments that a country has to
make during a given time period.

   - **Default** . A developing country is said to be in default when it fails to make the repayments of
principal and/or interest specified in its loan contract and has no intention of repaying in the future.

   - **Moratorium.** A developing country announces its refusal to make the payments of principal
and/or interest specified in its loan contract until it can come to an agreement over future
repayments with its creditors. A moratorium differs from default in that the debtor has
the intention to continue repayments later on provided it can reach suitable repayment
arrangements with its creditors.

   - **Debt rescheduling** . !is occurs when all or part of the repayments of principal and/or interest
due on outstanding debt are postponed to some date in the future. Importantly, when debt is
rescheduled interest is payable on the postponed repayments.

   - **Debt provisioning** . !is is the term used when banks decide to set aside funds into their reserves
to cushion themselves against the costs of a debtor nation defaulting on part of its obligations. !e
provisioning does not alter the contractual obligations of the debtor to repay its borrowing.

   - **Debt forgiveness** . !is occurs when the creditor writes off part or all of the principal and/
	 - r interest payable on an outstanding loan. Debt forgiveness thereby reduces the contractual
	 - bligations of the debtor.

15.7 BACKGROUND AND ORIGINS OF THE DEBT CRISIS

Although the debt crisis $ared up in the early 1980s, the developing countries had previously defaulted on

loan repayments in the 1930s. Bolivia had defaulted in 1931 and was followed by most other Latin American

countries during the next three years. !e effect of these defaults was to make developed countries extremely

wary of lending to the developing countries on other than a short-term basis right up to the 1970s. Nevertheless,

a great deal of direct investment in developing countries took place in the 1950s and 1960s, especially with a

view to exploiting their raw material resources which were a necessary base for reconstruction and economic

growth in the developed countries. !e main threat posed to such investment was that of excessive taxation

- r even nationalization by the developing country concerned.

!e origins of the debt crisis date back to the oil price shock following the Egypt–Israel war of October 1973.

!e quadrupling of the oil price was particularly harmful to the non-oil-producing developing countries, who

experienced an enormous increase in their import expenditure, and on top of this the resulting recession in

developed countries severely curtailed their export earnings. As a result of this the current account deficits of

the developing countries rose from \$8.7 billion in 1973 to \$42.9 billion in 1974 and \$51.3 billion in 1975. !e

terms of trade index of oil-importing developing countries deteriorated substantially between 1973 and 1975

from 100 to 40; this meant that in 1975 they needed two and a half times the amount of export volumes for

every unit of imports than they had in 1973.

While the oil price rise put the developing and developed countries' current accounts into heavy deficit,

the counterpart of this was that the OPEC members experienced a massive increase in their current account

surplus which rose from \$6.2 billion in 1973 to \$66.7 billion in 1974. !e absorptive capacity of the OPEC

economies was such that this enormous increase in their incomes could not all be spent on increased imports

- f investment and consumption goods. In consequence, they placed much of the so-called 'petrodollars' on
the London and New York money markets. OPEC members preferred to deposit their money with developed
countries' financial centres rather than lend directly to oil-importing developing countries because they

- ffered a security and range of investment opportunities for their funds that the developing countries could
not compete with.

!e enormous funds received by London and US banks raised the issue of how the banks could profitably

utilize the money. !e rise in in$ation resulting from the oil shocks meant that real interest rates in

industrialized countries were either low or even negative. By contrast, developing governments were keen to

avoid having to adopt de$ationary measures to control their current account deficits; instead, they sought to

borrow funds to finance the deficits. !e alternative of an IMF adjustment package that would have severely

curtailed economic growth was not considered particularly appealing.

!e view prevalent among the international banking community, that Latin America was set for high rates

- f economic growth, led to a 'recycling' of the petrodollars in the form of massive lending to the developing
countries. Most of the loans made to these countries were made in dollars by syndicates of international banks
with $oating rates of interest based upon a margin over dollar LIBOR. Banks preferred to lend at $oating rates

- f interest because the rates they paid on their deposits were variable; they were keen to protect themselves
should the rates of interest they had to pay on deposits rise. !e other side of the coin was that it le( the
developing countries exposed to the risk of a sudden rise in world interest rates. Since the vast majority of
developing countries' borrowing was public or publicly guaranteed, the banks regarded the risk of any default

- n the debt as being negligible. It is of note that, at the time, the recycling was highly praised by governments
and international institutions, although the IMF was more cautious.

366

The Latin American Debt Crisis

15.8 THE EMERGENCE OF THE DEBT CRISIS

Although developing countries' indebtedness rose substantially from \$130 billion in 1973 to \$336 billion

in 1978, the developing countries were experiencing healthy rates of economic growth and not having any

particular di'culties in servicing their debts. However, a number of unfavourable factors led to a rapid

deterioration of their indebtedness and ability to service their repayments over the following four years.

In 1979 the OPEC cartel more than doubled the price of oil from $13 to $32 per barrel. Industrialized

countries' response to this second oil shock was more uniform than that following the first oil shock: they were

determined to reduce the in$ationary consequences, even if this meant an increase in their unemployment

levels. At the end of 1979 the US authorities adopted a tight monetary policy designed to control its in$ation

rate, with the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Japan adopting similarly tough policies. By contrast, the

developing countries preferred to borrow further funds and their outstanding debt nearly doubled from \$336

billion in 1978 to \$662 billion in 1982. Cline (1984) has estimated that higher oil prices accounted for a \$260

billion increase in non-oil-producing less-developed country debt.

In addition to increasing indebtedness, there was a substantial rise in interest rates due to a rapid rise in

the US budget deficit, with the dollar LIBOR interest rate rising from 9.5 to 16.6% between mid-1978 and

mid-1981. !e rise in interest rates was one of the major factors contributing to the severe world recession

- f 1981 to 1983. In turn, the recession had a devastating effect on the developing countries because it both
dramatically reduced their export volumes and reduced the price of their exports, leading to a substantial
fall in their export earnings. In addition, the recession induced the developed economies to adopt a more
protectionist stance vis-à-vis imported goods which further squeezed developing countries' export earnings.
Table 15.1 shows the evolution of the current accounts of the big four debtor nations.

!e high US interest rates and borrowing had two other effects. First, bankers were less willing to lend to

the developing countries because of the increased attraction of lending the money to the USA. Second, the

high interest rates contributed to a rapid real appreciation of the US dollar which in turn meant an increase in

the real value of developing countries' debt-service repayments.

International Finance

!e result of all these factors was that in 1982 most developing countries, particularly in Latin America,

found themselves with record levels of indebtedness and debt-service repayments, while their ability to raise

revenues to finance the repayments had greatly diminished. Much of the borrowing they had undertaken

had not been profitably used for investment purposes but merely wasted on ine'cient state enterprises and

maintaining artificially high consumption levels. Although we concentrate primarily on the external factors

behind the debt crisis there is no doubt that domestic economic policy mismanagement played a major part

in the debtors' problems.

15.9 THE MEXICAN MORATORIUM

!e debt crisis began with the Mexican moratorium which was announced on 12 August 1982. In the early

1980s the Mexican economy was facing a mixture of external and internal problems. Since the mid-1970s

Mexico had been a major oil exporter, and for this reason was a beneficiary of the rise in oil prices resulting

from the 1973–74 and 1979 oil shocks. As the Mexican state both owned and controlled the oil industry,

the revenues from oil sales accrued directly to the government. International bankers, particularly in the

USA, looking at Mexican oil reserves viewed the country as a very safe place to lend money. Given its high

- il revenues the Mexican government was keen to adopt a programme of increased public expenditure for
improving its infrastructure and a variety of social programmes. !e result was that the government ran a
huge fiscal deficit which led to high economic growth. Overall, Mexico experienced a prosperous decade in
the 1970s.

Following the second oil shock some major problems began to confront the Mexican economy. In the

a(ermath of the first oil shock the industrialized countries had taken measures to reduce their dependence

- n imported oil so that their response to the rise in oil prices following the 1979 price shock was more elastic
than was the case in 1974. In addition, the major worldwide recession led to a further decline in the demand
for oil. Mexico's relatively high in$ation rate (27% in 1981) made the peso, which was pegged to the US dollar,
increasingly overvalued. !is, combined with the authorities' fiscal deficit (some 16.2% of GDP in 1982) and
the decline in oil export revenues meant that the country's current account moved into a large deficit (12.5%

- f GDP in 1981 and 6.2% of GDP in 1982).

!e Mexican economy's problems, especially the widely perceived view that its currency was overvalued,

had for some time led to speculation that the peso would be devalued. Speculation against the peso meant

large capital out$ows and a fall in the reserve holdings of Banco de Mexico’s (Mexico’s central bank) reserves.

In a bid to reduce the current account deficit the peso was devalued in February 1982, but the government

failed to adopt other measures to control the deficit such as reducing its fiscal deficit and monetary growth

rate. In such circumstances, the main effect of the devaluation was to give an additional boost to Mexico’s

in$ation rate. !e deteriorating position of Mexico's economy and the lack of confidence in its government's

resolve to reduce its budget deficit made international bankers increasingly reluctant to extend further new

loans to it.

Mexico's ever-increasing debt repayments, while its ability to service them was being undermined by its

reduced export earnings, led to further speculation against the peso and a run on the Banco de Mexico's

reserves. To stop a crisis developing, on 12 August 1982 the Mexican government announced a moratorium

- n its debt repayments until a satisfactory arrangement could be drawn up with its creditors. !e country
requested further new loans from foreign governments and a rescheduling of its principal repayments which
were falling due. In addition, it made a request for loans from the IMF in return for the adoption of an IMFsponsored stabilization programme.

15.10 THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DEBT CRISIS

As a result of the Mexican moratorium international banks began to realize that many other countries were

facing similar di'culties in servicing their debt; Table 15.2 shows the rapid growth of external debt for the

big four debtors.

!e real fear of both the banks and the authorities in the industrialized countries was that if Mexico

went into default they would be quickly followed by other major debtors. Many US banks had more loans

- utstanding in Latin America than the value of their equity, as shown in Table 15.3, and a default by any of the
big four debtor nations could easily have set off a chain reaction of banking failures and provoked a collapse

- f the banking systems in the developed countries. Not surprisingly, both the banks and authorities of the
industrialized countries were determined to avert such a scenario.

Precisely how the banks got so heavily exposed with their developing country lending is not easy to explain

(see Nunnenkemp, 1986, ch. 7 for an extended discussion). In retrospect there were clear $aws in their creditrating procedures and they got somewhat carried away with syndicated loans. As Graham Bird (1989, p. 17)

explains, the most simple and convincing explanation was that the banks made major mistakes:

Certainly, looking back at the 1970s, it appears now that the banks overlent. With the benefit of hindsight,

such overlending can be explained in a number of ways. With little recent evidence of country default,

the banks probably underestimated the risks of lending. !ey probably lacked the information necessary

to calculate such risks and they may have miscalculated the impact of world recession and rising interest

rates on the position of the debtors. Beyond this, a belief that short term lending would enable them

to extricate themselves if necessary and a confidence generated by the fact that other banks were also

lending, as well as a belief that banks would not be allowed to go bust by national and international

regulatory authorities, all had the effect of reducing their perceived risks.

15.11 A SUPPLY AND DEMAND FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSING THE DEBT CRISIS

Modelling the debt crisis is an extremely complex task because so many variables in$uence lending and

borrowing decisions. Nevertheless, the explosion of new lending up to 1981 and the fall off a(er 1982 can

be very approximately modelled using a supply and demand for new loans framework as illustrated in

Figure 15.1. When determining the slope of the supply and demand schedules for new loans, problems are

encountered because of the need to distinguish the effects of interest rate changes on the stock of outstanding

debt. !e demand for new loans comes from the debtor nation and is assumed to be inversely related to the

rate of interest, as a lower rate makes borrowing more attractive to debtor nations. However, it can be argued

that lower interest rate payments, by reducing the debt-service payments on existing debt that a debtor has to

make, may actually lead to a fall in its demand for new loans. If this latter effect is strong this may mean an

upward-sloping demand schedule.

!e supply of loans schedule is given by S and has been drawn positively sloped initially but backwardsloping once interest rates rise to a certain level. !e problem facing the banks is that new lending in the

current period will decrease the incentives for debtors to default today while increasing the potential and

incentives for the debtor to default in future periods. Hence, the banks will only be prepared to supply new

loans in the current period if there is a su'cient rise in the interest rate to compensate. However, beyond a

certain rate of interest there is a danger that debtors may be encouraged to default and, for this reason, above

this interest rate, the banks may be less willing to make new loans, leading to a backward-sloping supply of

new loans schedules.

For the purposes of our basic analysis, we shall assume that the supply and demand schedules have

their)conventional slopes. Figure 15.2 illustrates the supply and demand for loans situation in 1973–82 and

1983–94. In Figure 15.2(a) the supply and demand situation just prior to the first oil shock is represented

money balances on the international money markets which greatly increased the supply of funds available for

lending to the developing countries, and this is represented by a rightward shi( of the supply of loans schedule

to S2. In Figure 15.2(a) the shi( of the supply schedule is assumed to be greater than the shi( of the demand

schedule so that the interest rate falls. Overall lending increases from _L_ 1 per annum to _L_ 2 while the interest

rates remained fairly low.

!e situation changed somewhat in 1982 and continued right up to 1994. While the demand for funds

may still have been increasing from D2 to D3, there was a large le(ward shi( of the supply of funds from

S2 to S3. !is shi( can largely be explained by the dramatic change in the perceived risks of lending to the

debtor countries resulting from the Mexican moratorium. Another factor accounting for the supply shi( was

the increasing attractiveness of lending funds to countries like the United States due to the need to finance its

increasing budget and current account deficit. As a result, the interest rates charged rose while the volume of

new lending declined.

15.12 THE ECONOMICS OF DEFAULT

Once the enormity of the debt crisis emerged the main aim of the commercial banks and authorities of the

industrialized nations was to avoid one of the major debtor nations declaring a default on its debt obligations.

Much of the handling of the debt crisis can be viewed as the authorities and commercial banks of developed

countries adopting strategies designed to avert such a default, while at the same time attempting to minimize

the financial losses for the banks involved. Since most of the loans taken out by the developing countries were

government or publicly guaranteed, any default would represent a sovereign default; the most important point

about this type of default is that there are no legal remedies available for the creditors to retrieve their money.

Nevertheless, debtor nations are normally very reluctant to default on their loans because the savings in the

way of repayments are usually less than the perceived costs of declaring a default. We now proceed to examine

these potential costs of default.

_The costs of sovereign default_

Since a debtor government cannot be legally brought to account for a failure to repay its external debts, there

must be some perceived costs associated with sovereign default that make countries reluctant to declare a

default. !e three most commonly cited costs of declaring a default are:

 - **Exclusion from future borrowing.** A country that declares a default on its external obligations is
likely to be excluded from the possibility of future external borrowing. !ose foreign creditors that
lose from the default will not be prepared to lend further funds, while prospective lenders will view
lending to the country as especially risky. In addition, creditor governments could prevent the IMF
and World Bank making further funds available to the defaulting nation. Unable to attract foreign
funds for investment purposes, the defaulting nation will be constrained to finance its domestic
investment from its relatively low domestic savings which will limit its economic growth. In addition,
the country will not be able to smooth out the costs associated with adverse economic shocks by
borrowing on world capital markets.

 - **Reduced gains from trade.** One of the major costs associated with default would be that the
defaulting country would face the increased possibility of protectionist trade measures being adopted
against it. !ere would be a risk that its exports could be subject to seizure when passing through
international borders. Gaining trade credit to finance imports will prove di'cult in the light of its
default, which is likely to result in a substantial reduction of the defaulting country's volume of trade
and with it major welfare losses.

 - **Seizure of overseas assets.** Although creditors of the defaulting country would be unable to take the
debtor governments to court, they might be able to persuade their governments to freeze or seize

372

The Latin American Debt Crisis

assets of the defaulting nation which are held within the creditor's legal jurisdiction. Many developing

countries' governments hold large proportions of their gold and foreign exchange reserves with

central banks of the developed nations and they would be worried about the freezing of those assets if

they were to default on loans extended by o'cial creditors.

!e perceived costs of default are especially worrisome for developing countries' governments because they

are very di'cult to quantify and are plagued by uncertainty. A debtor government can only guess the extent

and duration for which its trade volumes and borrowing capacity would be undermined. !e costs of an

individual debtor going into default while other debtors do not are likely to be particularly high, especially as

creditors would want to demonstrate to other debtors that default is a costly option. If all major debtors were

to declare default, the creditor nations would have considerably less scope to adopt penalties. !is being the

case, the creditor nations would have incentives to avoid the formation of debtors' cartels.

_The benefits of default_

!e benefit from the debtor nation's viewpoint of defaulting is that it saves both the repayment of principal

due and the interest due on its outstanding debt. Such a sum represents the debt-service repayment:

_DS_                - _P_                - _rD_ (15.1)

where _DS_ is the debt-service repayment, _P_ is the principal and interest due, _r_ is the rate of interest and _D_ is

the stock of debt remaining. Equation (15.1) states that the debt service to be paid is the principal and interest

due, plus the interest payment on the stock of outstanding debt.

Although the debt-service ratio represents the payments that the debtor will be expected to make, it does

not represent the net repayment, which is the debt service less net new loans received, which is known as the

net resource transfer ( _NRT_ ) from the debtor to the creditor nations:

_NRT_              - _P_              - _rD_              - _L_              - _DS_              - _L_ (15.2)

where _L_ is the net new loans received by the debtor.

!e net resource transfer in this simple model can be thought of as the net saving or benefit from defaulting

- n the debt. Let us assume that the perceived costs of default are some constant value C. !is being the case,
the country will not default so long as the net resource transfer is less than the perceived costs of default.
A)country will not default on its debt provided:

_NRT_              - _P_              - _rD_              - _L_              - _C_ (15.3)

while a country will default on its debt if:

_NRT_              - _P_              - _rD_              - _L_              - _C_ (15.4)

Notice that, according to equation (15.4), since the costs of default are positive, a debtor will only consider

default if the net resource transfer from the developing countries to its creditors is positive. In other words, the

debtor's debt-service payments exceed the new loans that it receives, implying a positive benefit from default

that exceeds the positive costs of defaulting.

373

International Finance

Equations (15.3) and (15.4) are very important in understanding the various strategies adopted by banks to

encourage the debtor nations not to default. To avoid default the banks must keep the benefits of default lower

than the costs of default, and this can be done by either raising the perceived costs of default or reducing the

costs of servicing the debt. Commercial banks can persuade debtors not to default by a variety of mechanisms.

!ey can reduce the principal repayments due by restructuring debt repayments over longer time horizons;

they can reduce the interest rate repayments due on the stock of outstanding debt; or they can reduce the

stock of debt outstanding or engage in new lending. All these methods of reducing the perceived benefits from

defaulting have cropped up in one form or another in the management of the debt crisis.

15.13 THE ROLE AND VIEWPOINTS OF THE ACTORS IN THE DEBT CRISIS

!ere were very divergent views on the nature and extent of the debt crisis and these differences led to

differing perspectives on how best to manage the crisis. !ese viewpoints were partly coloured by the differing

interests of the four major actors involved: the international banks that lent the funds; the authorities of

the developed nations; the international institutions, notably the World Bank and the IMF; and the debtor

nations. We shall brie$y overview their perspectives and roles in the crisis, although we need to be wary of

treating these actors as homogeneous groups. For example, the international banks that lent the money had

differing degrees of exposure, faced differing regulatory and tax regimes and o(en had diverse views on the

appropriate policy response. Likewise, the debtor nations had differing degrees of indebtedness, repayment

burdens and prospects with regard to debt repayment. As for the national authorities, their economies had

varying degrees of trading links and different historical and strategic relationships with the debtors.

_The commercial banks_

!e immediate reaction of international banks to the emergence of the debt problem was to view it as primarily

a 'liquidity crisis'. Bankers believed that high interest rates and a large amount of principal repayments falling

due, combined with adverse economic conditions, had meant that the debtor nations were finding themselves

in only short-term di'culties. To support this viewpoint it was argued that the debt profile of the debtors

was primarily of a short-term horizon and that nations do not go bankrupt. As such, the banks early on

sought solutions based upon restructuring the debtors' repayments to give the debtors more time to pay.

Banks initially preferred rescheduling debt repayments and at the same time sought to ensure that additional

interest was paid on the postponed principal repayments. Following the onset of the crisis the banks were very

reluctant to extend new funds to the debtors given the precarious position of their outstanding loans; many

bankers took the view that extending new loans to the debtors was 'throwing good money a(er bad'. Despite

this, the banks realized that without new loans the incentives for the debtors to default would rise and so some

further lending was an essential part of the restructuring packages designed to avert default.

Bankers were opposed to granting any debt forgiveness for a number of reasons. !ey argued that granting

forgiveness to one country would lead other debtors to seek similar relief. Also, debt relief might discourage

the debtors from taking the measures necessary to improve their economic performance to ensure they would

qualify for debt relief. In addition, bankers argued that granting a country a degree of debt relief would brand

it as uncreditworthy so that new loans to the country would dry up. In summary, the view of the banking

community was that granting debt relief was too costly for banks to contemplate and ultimately harmful to

the debtor nations themselves. Banks argued that any new lending to the Latin American countries should

be carried out by the national authorities of the industrialized countries and international institutions. !e

374

The Latin American Debt Crisis

banks were also keen to treat each debtor on a 'case-by-case' approach, motivated not only by a belief that

the circumstances facing each debtor were different but also because the different creditor banks had varying

degrees of exposure to each debtor, making a uniform solution impracticable.

_National authorities_

!e national authorities of the industrialized countries were primarily concerned to avoid a calamitous collapse

- f their banking systems which could result from a default by one of the major debtors. However, they were
also extremely wary of utilizing public funds to ease the debtors' plight. Authorities did not wish to be seen
to be 'bailing out' the commercial banks whose lending had gone bad. In addition, any significant assistance
would be extremely costly and be at the expense of reduced public expenditure or increased taxes. A general
feeling was that further loans by the authorities would not help when the problem of the debtors was having
too much debt already. Nevertheless, the authorities (especially the US administration) had strategic and
economic interests in Latin American debtors, making it impossible for them to be indifferent to the debtors'
plight. Rather than get involved in lending new money to the developing countries, most authorities were
prepared to allow some tax concessions for the provisions that banks made against possible losses on their
lending. In addition, authorities were prepared to increase the amount of capital available to the World Bank
and the IMF for lending to developing countries. Channelling funds via these institutions was considered
useful because both the World Bank and the IMF could ensure that developing countries undertook the
appropriate measures to reform their economies; developing countries nearly always ensure repayment of
funds to these institutions.

_The IMF and the World Bank_

!e two main international institutions involved in the debt crisis played somewhat differing and at times

con$icting roles, although in the later stages there was a more coherent policy stance. !e World Bank was

very much concerned about the sheer size and extent of the debt crisis, and particularly the costs in terms of

slower development that debt repayments impose upon the debtor nations. On the other hand, the IMF saw

its main role as ensuring that the debtor nations that came to it for assistance adopted the tough economic

measures required to improve their longer-term ability to service their debt. Another role played by the IMF

was to ensure that creditor banks continued su'cient new lending to the debtor nations to make it worthwhile

for the debtor nations to accept an IMF-sponsored adjustment package.

From time to time the two institutions came into con$ict over the handling of the debt crisis, the World

Bank criticizing the IMF for setting too severe economic adjustment programmes and to some extent

infringing upon the Bank's traditional domain. Overall, the direct financial impact that the two organizations

could make was very much limited by the amount of finance they had available. !e World Bank had to be

careful not to undermine its AAA credit rating by over-extending itself to the SIMICs, while the amount of

short-term finance provided by the IMF was quite limited compared to the extent of the debt crisis.

_The debtors_

!e debtors to a large extent viewed the crisis in which they found themselves as not of their making but due

to a combination of external factors beyond their control. As such, they felt that the creditor banks should

allow some degree of debt forgiveness in the form of reducing the stock of debt owed by the debtors and/

- r reduced interest rate repayments below market rates. Surprisingly, attempts to form a debtors' cartel to

375

International Finance

improve their bargaining positions vis-à-vis the creditor banks did not come to anything. !is was partly

because the debtors had differing debt problems and so were unable to agree on the way they could best be

helped; in addition, the debtors were in competition with one another for whatever new lending was available,

and creditor banks were careful to treat them on a case-by-case basis rather than as a group. !e debtors

consistently argued their need for some debt forgiveness as an incentive to make economic adjustments.

Without such relief they would have little incentive to adjust as all the improved economic performance

would go to creditors to pay off their debts.

15.14 THE MANAGEMENT OF THE DEBT CRISIS

!e debt crisis was managed throughout on a case-by-case basis, with the creditor banks dealing with each

debtor nation individually rather than collectively as a group. Banks argued that this was the only realistic

- ption because the problem confronting each of the debtors had its own particular characteristics, requiring its
- wn solutions. Another advantage of this strategy from the viewpoint of the banks is that it helped to prevent
the formation of a debtors' cartel that would have resulted in an increased bargaining weight of the debtor
nations. Despite this, however, there were common characteristics in the treatment extended to the debtors.
!e management of the debt crisis can be divided up into three distinct phases: (1) the crisis-management
phase of 1982–October 1985; (2) the Baker Plan phase of October 1985–March 1989; and (3) the post-Brady
Plan phase of March 1989–94.

_Phase 1: Crisis management, 1982–October 1985_

Bankers initially perceived the crisis as a temporary 'liquidity' problem rather than as a solvency problem. It

was argued that the debtors were facing a temporary financing problem due to the rise in US interest rates and

a squeeze on their export earnings. As such, the main strategy was to reschedule the debt repayments falling

due, in order to avoid an outright default that would seriously threaten the financial stability of exposed banks

and the banking community in general. A number of short-term debt rescheduling packages were arranged,

the main features of which included a short-term (two to four years) maturity structure on the rescheduled

debt, with interest and fees chargeable for the rescheduling. An important point about the rescheduling

agreements was that the banks only lent money so that the debtor countries could continue to service their

debts – so-called 'involuntary lending' – with the result that all voluntary lending suddenly ceased.

It is important to note that debt rescheduling packages were not unconditional: the debtor had to accept

an IMF adjustment programme as part of the package, there being no point in extending new money to the

debtors unless there were improved prospects of debt-service repayments being made. An IMF adjustment

programme generally has the following features:

!e setting of tight monetary and fiscal targets designed to squeeze aggregate demand in the debtor

economies, the tight fiscal policy being based primarily on reducing government expenditure. !e

tight monetary policy involves the setting of targets for certain monetary aggregates designed to

stabilize in$ation.

A one-off devaluation of the debtor's real exchange rate to improve the country's international

competitiveness.

3. Market-based reforms such as reducing food subsidies that distort the allocation of resources and

reduced trade protectionism. !e privatization of state-owned industries is generally encouraged

376

The Latin American Debt Crisis

since it raises finance and is believed to promote greater e'ciency. In the financial sector the removal

    - f interest-rate ceilings resulting in generally higher real rates of return is seen as a better means for

allocating scarce capital and promoting domestic savings.

!e measures have been aptly summed up as 'devaluation, de$ation and deregulation'. Overall, the combination

- f reduced aggregate demand and improved competitiveness from the devaluation is designed to improve
the debtor's current account balance and, thereby, its ability to finance its debt-service commitments. Such
measures are o(en costly in the short term, resulting in low and even negative economic growth, usually
accompanied by increased unemployment and rises in the prices of basic commodities such as food. Not
surprisingly, IMF programmes can be very unpopular with the public in the debtor nations as they invariably
mean reduced living standards.

Evaluation of the crisis-management phase

!e crisis-management phase was almost exclusively about ensuring the financial stability of the banks that had

lent to the debtor countries. As such, it was essential that an outright default by any of the debtors be avoided,

as such a default could have seriously endangered confidence in the banking system of the industrialized

nations. !e problem was that relatively little consideration was given to the needs of the debtor countries

and that further debt in the form of 'involuntary' lending was piled upon already heavy debt loads. !e initial

appraisal of the crisis as a temporary liquidity crisis was also somewhat erroneous – the debt crisis was to

prove far more serious and long-lasting. Table 15.4 shows the evolution of external debt statistics and key

ratios over the period 1982–2002.

!e debtor countries suffered from an immediate drying-up of new bank lending and any funds extended

to them were merely to ensure that they continued to pay their debts. Not surprisingly they suffered greatly

during the crisis management phase and this was one of the factors that prompted the Baker Plan.

_Phase 2: The Baker Plan phase, October 1985–March 1989_

In October 1985 the US Treasury Secretary James Baker announced a major three-year initiative for

managing the debt crisis. !e Baker Plan was launched against a background of increasing disenchantment

- n the part of debtor nations over the recessionary impact of adjustment programmes and the drying-up of
voluntary bank lending. !e Plan endorsed the case-by-case approach to dealing with the debt crisis, that is,
treating each debtor nation in a manner appropriate to its individual circumstances. Baker envisaged debtor
nations 'growing-out' of their debt problems by undertaking market-based structural reforms, including
trade liberalization, cuts in government expenditure and relaxation of regulations relating to inward foreign
investment. An enhanced role for the IMF and World Bank in promoting economic growth was envisaged via
increased and more effective structural adjustment lending, and a target of \$20 billion over the next three years
was set for new lending by the commercial banks to the 15 major debtor nations. Such additional lending by
private banks was supported by a \$10 billion increase in lending by multilateral development banks (mainly
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank).

An evaluation of the Baker Plan

Overall, the implementation of the Baker plan was not considered a success. Voluntary bank lending did

not resume on the scale envisaged by the Plan and even o'cial lending fell well short of its target (see Cline,

1995) with only around \$1 billion of the projected \$10 billion increase being disbursed. Economic growth

in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina stagnated and in$ation rocketed (see Tables 15.5 and 15.6). Although their

current account performance stabilized, their rates of economic growth, levels of investment to GDP and

trade volumes exhibited a significant slowdown. Indeed, the overall levels of indebtedness and many of the

debt service ratios continued to deteriorate.

!e reasons for the failure of the Plan were fairly straightforward – there was little incentive for banks to

extend further new loans when the problem of the region was already viewed as one of too much debt. Also,

the Plan offered little incentive for the debtors to undertake new investment since any improved economic

performance would merely result in increased payments to the creditor banks. As a result of economic hardship

many countries were not in full compliance with the existing IMF programmes and were in continual dispute

with the IMF over the content of stabilization programmes.

The shift from Baker to Brady

!e failure of o'cial agencies to resolve the crisis meant that the banks increasingly sought other means of

resolving their di'culties. From the mid-1980s a secondary market for developing-country debt emerged on

which the creditor banks could sell their outstanding loan assets to third parties (mainly other commercial

banks) at a discount to its face value – the size of the secondary market was estimated by the IMF to be

380

The Latin American Debt Crisis

approximately \$5 billion in 1985 and \$30–40 billion in 1988. Part of the secondary market is made up of

swaps between banks which enable them to reshu%e their loan exposure portfolios to various countries. !e

price of secondary debt of the 15 SIMIC (1994 classification) debtor nations plummeted from an average

70 cents to 35 cents per dollar over the period of the Baker Plan, re$ecting the increasing probability that a

significant proportion of the debt would eventually have to be written off. One of the reasons behind the rising

discount was a Brazilian moratorium on its debt repayments announced in February 1987 which increased the

perception that the debt crisis would be di'cult to resolve without some form of debt reduction. Worsening

market valuations made it increasingly untenable for banks not to make provisions against the loans.

Following the Brazilian moratorium, Citicorp – the major US bank – announced in May 1987 that it

was setting aside \$3 billion to its loan-loss reserves against its lending to developing countries. Following

the Citicorp announcement, provisioning by other banks became inevitable and other major banks both in

the USA and Europe announced their own provisioning. !erea(er provisioning became a regular feature

in the annual accounts of the major international commercial banks with exposure to the debtor nations.

When a bank made provisions it was purely an accounting exercise with the bank putting aside reserves

against outstanding loans in low-earning but risk-free assets, the reported profit figures being reduced by the

amount of the provisions, so lowering dividend payments to bank shareholders. It is important to note that,

while provisioning prepared the banks for any eventual losses on their outstanding debts, it did not reduce

the contractual obligations of the debtors to repay their debt. In other words, provisioning was quite distinct

from 'writing off' loans, whereby the bank reduces the contractual obligations of the debtor. Nonetheless,

provisioning was an important step to clearing the path to some form of debt forgiveness.

_Phase 3: Post-Brady Plan phase, 1989–94_

A significant reformulation of the strategy for dealing with the debt crisis was signalled by the new US

Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in March 1989. !e case-by-case approach, encouraging debtors to

undertake market-based reforms and the adoption of stable macroeconomic policies, continued to be viewed

as an essential component for resolving the debt crisis. However, in addition to emphasizing the need for new

bank lending, the Brady Plan also explicitly recognized the contribution that voluntary debt forgiveness could

make in resolving the crisis. Brady argued that the path to creditworthiness for many SIMICs required some

debt and debt-service reduction on a case-by-case basis. !e major innovation of the Brady initiative was

its inclusion of o'cial support for debt and debt-service reduction. Both the World Bank and the IMF were

asked to set aside funds for this purpose to be targeted at SIMICs with high external debt problems and that

were undertaking appropriate adjustment programmes. Subsequently, US Treasury Undersecretary David

Mulford set a target of \$70 billion for debt forgiveness on the \$340 billion of debt owed by 39 of the major

debtor nations. !e IMF and World Bank were earmarked \$24 billion of funds that could be used for lending

purposes designed to support countries that adopted appropriate economic policies and where a debt and

debt-service reduction (DDSR) programme was successfully negotiated.

Under the aegis of the Brady Plan, 25 DDSR agreements were concluded with some 23 countries by

December 1995. A summary of the results of various DDSRs between 1988 and 1994 is shown in Table 15.7.

Between 1989 and 1994 some \$370 billion of debt was restructured and \$100 billion of debt forgiven in

aggregate. Some \$224 billion of restructuring was concentrated on the severely indebted countries, with \$56

billion forgiven. !e DDSRs have been characterized as 'loans for bonds' deals, whereby bank-loan claims

were replaced by bond-holding claims. Mexico negotiated a DDSR in March 1990, followed by Venezuela in

December 1990, Argentina in April 1993 and Brazil in April 1994. !e terms of the individual DDSRs varied

but there were common elements.

Each creditor bank was offered a menu of policy options to choose from. !ey could accept a

reduction in the principal owed to them, a reduction in the interest payable or a mixture of the two.

Alternatively, they could opt to preserve the majority of their existing claims but would then be

expected to engage in new lending to the country concerned. In the Mexican deal the reduction on

principal was 35% for the 'discount bond' that maintained the market rate of interest at LIBOR +

13/16%; while for the 'par bonds' that maintained their face value, the interest rate was fixed at 6,%,

well below the then prevailing interest rate of 10%. Alternatively, banks that wished to maintain their

full claim were expected to provide 'new money' equivalent to 25% of their exposure over three years.

2. Restructured debt normally had a long term to maturity, typically 20 to 30 years, and was usually

backed for principal repayment and some interest repayment by a purchase of zero-coupon US bonds

by the debtor nation using a mixture of its own funds and loans from multilateral institutions such

as the World Bank and the IMF. In the Mexican deal, in the event that oil prices rose above \$14 per

barrel (at constant 1989 prices), bond-holders were entitled to some 'claw back', that is, additional

payments a(er seven years.

3. As part of the DDSR the debtor country adopted a medium-term IMF stabilization programme

designed to ensure its debt-repayment capacity and a better macroeconomic performance.

An evaluation of the Brady Plan

Authors such as Claessens and Wijnbergen (1993) pronounced the Brady Plan a 'spectacular success'. !ey

view Brady-type deals as having been particularly successful in reducing high and volatile external transfers to

more manageable and predictable levels. Cline (1995) also sees the Brady Plan as a success because it achieved

significant results at relatively low levels of debt forgiveness of approximately 15% of the overall debt burden

and annual interest savings to the debtor nations of 0.5% to 1% of their GDP, or around 3% of their export

earnings. Cline attributes the success of Brady deals as due to a perception on the part of debtor nations that

there was a more equitable sharing of the debt burden between themselves and the creditor banks. Cline

argues that a clear distinction needs to be made between the ability to pay on the one hand and the willingness

to pay on the other. He argues that debt repayments are usually the lower of these two; throughout the 1980s

the willingness to pay was relatively low compared to the ability to pay because the debtors perceived the

adjustment packages as placing an unfair burden on themselves and being too biased to the needs of the

creditor banks. Brady-type deals and some debt forgiveness by the banks raised the willingness to pay of

many debtors so that payments have become related to the (higher) ability to pay. More recently, Reinhart et

al. (2003) have coined the phrase 'debt intolerance' to capture the idea that certain countries at certain levels

382

The Latin American Debt Crisis

- f debt decide to default, even though they have the capacity to repay, simply because they are not prepared
to make the sacrifices necessary to ensure full repayment. It is noticeable that Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil and
Argentina have a long history of debt defaults. Part of the problem is that, in the short term, governments
in these countries like the boost to public and private consumption and investment that capital in$ows can
bring, but they subsequently dislike the debt-servicing payments that follow in the longer run.

Generally speaking, although the Brady Plan was supposed to be a 'voluntary' system there is no doubt that

much political pressure was applied to the banks to accept some form of debt forgiveness, either in the form of

principal reduction or interest-rate reduction, rather than opting to preserve their existing claims and engage

in new lending. Indeed, in the Brazilian deal the Brazilian negotiators set an effective limit to the new money

- ption; the Argentinian deal ruled out the new money option completely; and considerable moral suasion was
applied to the creditor banks in the Mexican case.

One of the most visible effects of the Brady Plan was that there was a significant return of private capital

into each of the big four debtors in the year following the conclusion of a Brady deal. Furthermore, there

was a significant increase in the value of secondary market prices on outstanding debt (see Table 15.8). !e

- nly real black mark against the Brady Plan was that it took approximately five years to achieve the majority
- f its targets, rather than the three years originally envisaged. Nonetheless, by May 1994 some \$60 billion of
the target \$70 billion of debt had been forgiven, leaving Cline (1995, p. 243) to comment that 'the degree of
performance of the plan's original targets can only be judged as remarkable, especially by the standards of
most efforts at international economic coordination'.

15.15 AN OVERALL EVALUATION OF DEBT CRISIS MANAGEMENT

An overall evaluation of the management of the debt crisis must to some extent be based upon what the

- bjectives of debt crisis management have been. Cline (1995) identified three main objectives behind the
strategy:
Avoidance of a financial crisis and the collapse of the international banking system;

2. Restoration of capital-market access for debtor countries;
3. Minimizing the economic adjustment costs for debtor nations.

With regard to objectives 1 and 2 there is general agreement that the crisis management must be regarded as

a success. A major financial crisis for the international banking system was averted and no debtor opted for

- utright default. !e initial crisis management strategy involving concerted 'involuntary' lending prevented
an outright default and gave time for banks to build up capital reserves and make loan-loss provisions that
ultimately made debt forgiveness a viable strategy.

It can be questioned whether the initial diagnosis of the crisis as one of illiquidity was correct, and whether

insolvency requiring immediate debt forgiveness would have been more appropriate. Certainly, the failure of

the Baker Plan and the success of the Brady Plan is indicative that the debtor countries should have been granted

debt forgiveness at an earlier stage in the crisis. Indeed, David Mulford, the former US Treasury Undersecretary

who worked extensively on the Brady Plan, has stated that, 'in retrospect, Latin America could have suffered

less had the international community been prepared earlier to recognize and work with the reality of the

markets to resolve the crisis' ( _Wall Street Journal_, 21 August 1992). While there is undoubtedly some truth

to this, it must also be recognized that the banks were in no real position to consider debt forgiveness much

before the late 1980s following Citicorp's lead in making provisions. In addition, granting debt relief at an early

stage may well have increased the eventual write-offs and delayed the adoption of sound macropolicies by the

debtor nations. In retrospect, the initial diagnosis of illiquidity rather than insolvency was almost certainly

correct, in that the total amount of debt forgiveness eventually granted has been relatively small.

!ere is some truth to the argument that the majority of the burden was initially placed on the debtor countries

and was too biased to the needs of the creditor banks. A fairer sharing of the burden may have been appropriate,

especially as the crisis in large part was a re$ection of excessive lending by the commercial banks. In the end,

however, banks did share a fair degree of the burden by relinquishing approximately one-third of their claims.

!e 'quasi-voluntary' market-oriented nature of the eventual settlement was an important feature. Had

the banks been forced to write down debt, then they would probably have contested such measures in the

courts, which would have clouded Latin American access to capital markets for years to come. In the end, the

majority of banks voluntarily accepted principal and/or interest rate reduction at a lower rate than they might

have expected from the discount on the secondary market price of the debt during the worst days of the crisis.

!e banks forgave approximately one-third of the money owed, and given that some observers have argued

that the debtors had the capacity but were unwilling to pay back all the debt this must be seen as a reasonable

sharing of the eventual cost.

Another notable feature of the management of the debt crisis was that the banks were not bailed out at

public expense. Although public guarantees exist on some of the Brady exit bonds, the improved economic

policies in the debtor nations, lower debt service ratios and their return to capital market access reduced the

risk of these guarantees being called upon. What is true is that the share of the o'cial sector in the outstanding

debt of the SIMICs increased from 14% in 1982 to around 35% in 1994. However, this mainly re$ected the

lack of new funds made available by the commercial banks post-1982.

384

The Latin American Debt Crisis

!e one area where a question mark hangs over the success of the debt-management strategy is with respect

to the third objective. !e ten years following the start of the debt crisis in 1982 have been characterized as a

'lost decade' for Latin America: investment stagnated and per capita incomes in 1992 were lower in each of the

big four debtors compared to the 1979–81 average (14.1% in Venezuela, 12.7% in Argentina, 5.7% in Mexico

and 2% in Brazil).

!e role of the IMF and World Bank in the debt crisis has been criticized as being too biased in favour of the

creditors and requiring too heavy an adjustment by the debtors. To some extent this criticism is unfair because

the IMF o(en recommended policy measures that the debtor would have had to undertake anyhow. It merely

provided a convenient scapegoat for the debtor government to implement necessary adjustment packages.

!e IMF and World Bank simply did not have the resources to make more than a marginal impact on debtors'

financial positions. Overall, the IMF played a crucial role in coordinating the banks, and its stabilization

programmes were an important ingredient in the successful resolution of the crisis.

!e case-by-case approach taken to manage the crisis was almost certainly justified. A generalized scheme

to settle the debt problem would not have recognized that the economic circumstances and prospects of the

debtor nations were immensely varied. Nevertheless, the recognition of the fact that debtors' circumstances

differed should also have meant that IMF stabilization programmes exhibited a greater degree of variety than the

almost standard package of de$ation, devaluation and deregulation. Furthermore, there needed to be a greater

recognition that there was a large degree of interdependence among the debtor nations; it was no use encouraging

export-led growth by a number of debtors if such measures merely depressed their export prices on world

markets leaving)their export revenues stagnant. For instance, during 1981–85 Latin American export volumes

rose by)25% but the deterioration in their terms of trade meant that their export earnings remained stagnant.

15.16 POST-BRADY PLAN CRISES IN THREE OF THE COUNTRIES

While the Brady Plan was perceived as a great success and as heralding the end of the international debt crisis,

this verdict may have been a bit premature. It is certainly the case that the Brady restructuring plan coincided

with the ability of the international banking system to write down and restructure much of the debt on its

books, and access to international capital markets was also restored to many of the debtor nations. However,

it is less clear that the problem of debt build-up and debt-service was fully dealt with. As Table 15.4 shows,

the level of indebtedness of the big four debtors has continued to rise; and their economic growth rates, as

shown in Table 15.9, remained volatile. Finally, there have been significant post-Brady crises in three of the

countries: Mexico in 1994/95, Brazil in 1999, and more recently Argentina declared the largest-ever default

- n its external debt obligations in January 2002, at the same time as it ended its currency-board link to the US
dollar (see section 11.12 for details on each of the crises). !e Argentinian default in particular means that
some of the post-Brady Plan evaluations need to be reassessed.

15.17 CONCLUSIONS

!e debt crisis arose through a mixture of domestic and external circumstances which varied from debtor to

debtor. Nevertheless, the extent and close timing of debtors' problems suggests that common external factors

played a significant part in the crisis. It is too simplistic to apportion the crisis solely to excessive borrowing

by the debtor nations, since in large part the crisis also re$ected excessive lending by the commercial banks.

Although the crisis was in large part due to a combination of events outside the debtor countries' control,

up until 1989 most of the adjustment burden for managing the crisis fell heavily on the debtor nations.

The Latin American Debt Crisis

!ere is some justification in the criticism that initial management of the crisis was too biased towards the

requirements of the creditor banks rather than the needs of the debtor nations. However, following the Brady

Plan the banks did forgive a substantial proportion of the money owed as part of negotiated DDSRs. In the

end, debt forgiveness was crucial in improving the willingness as well as capacity to pay of the debtor nations,

particularly as debt reduction was linked to economic reform in those nations. Indeed, debt reduction

provided a significant incentive for the debtor nations to undertake economic reform as it guaranteed them a

share in any resulting future economic prosperity.

!ere are numerous lessons to be learnt from the debt crisis and its subsequent management. Most

importantly, banks need to be far more discriminating in making sovereign loans in the future and must

avoid leaving themselves over-exposed to one particular country or region. Also, when lending funds to

governments, careful consideration should be given as to whether the loans are being put to productive use by

the government concerned or whether they are merely being used to finance extravagant social programmes.

In addition, banks and creditors need to consider not only a country's capacity to repay loans, but also the

likely willingness to repay them in times of economic di'culty.

Another lesson that emerged is that in times of crisis, international organizations such as the IMF and

World Bank can play a critically important role in encouraging the adoption of sound macroeconomic

policies in debtor countries and in coordinating private-sector claims. Indeed, many debtor countries have

discovered that sound domestic economic policies are ultimately crucial to better economic performance,

and by building up confidence they can play a critical role in helping a country regain access to international

capital markets.

!e debt crisis signalled by the Mexican moratorium of 1982 could have resulted in an unprecedented

crisis for the industrialized nations' banking systems, but by the early 1990s they were in a position to

engage in write-downs and restructuring of debt such that the debt crisis no longer presented a threat to the

international financial system. !e management of the debt crisis involved a mixture of debt write-off by the

banks and economic reform in the debtor nations. !e return of capital $ows in the form of bond finance,

equity investment and foreign direct investment following the conclusion of Brady deals meant that capitalmarket access for most debtors was restored in just over a decade, which compares very favourably with the

four decades of cut-off that followed the Latin American defaults in the 1930s. However, the Argentinian

default in 2002, the related problems in Brazil in 1999 and even the Mexican crisis of 1994/95 show that the

issue of external debt is always a threat to the stability of output and economic prospects of countries that have

high external debts.
