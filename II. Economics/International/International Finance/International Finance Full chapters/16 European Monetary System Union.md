### 16.1 Introduction

In this chapter, we examine one of the most important economic issues ever tackled by the European Union (EU), namely the creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU). On 1 January 1999 EMU was finally realized in Europe when 11 founding countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) agreed to irrevocably fix their exchange rates with no margin of fluctuation and to replace their national currencies with a new European currency called the euro, which happened three years later on 1 January 2002. The original 11 have since been joined by Greece (1 January 2001), Slovenia (1 January 2007), Malta and Cyprus (1 January 2008), Slovakia (1 January 2009), Estonia (1 January 2011), Latvia (2014) and Lithuania (2015), bringing the total membership to 19 countries. This means that eight countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden) are EU members but have not yet adopted the euro. The United Kingdom and Denmark both negotiated 'opt-outs' from the EMU project and Sweden has a *de facto* opt-out. The UK has since departed the European Union on 1 January 2020 and is therefore unlikely to be part of any eurozone for the foreseeable future. However, all the new members of the EU that have joined since the commencement of the EMU have in principle agreed to adopt the euro at some point in the future as part of their accession agreements. The euro area population in early 2021 covers some 342 million citizens which is higher than the US population of 330 million.

Despite its successful realization, some ten years a(er its commencement the eurozone faced a severe test,

the so-called the 'eurozone crisis', which called into question the viability of the entire project. !e problem

- f the so-called PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) dominated the news headlines following
- n from the 2007 financial crisis. !e eurozone crisis involved bailouts of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and
Spain and, in the case of Greece's second bailout on 21 February 2012, involved large losses for private-sector
holders of Greek debt who took nominal losses of 53.5%, which equated to 78.5% in net present value terms

- nce restructuring of the remaining debt was taken into account (as determined by an auction of the debt on
19 March 2012).

!e crisis has also necessitated a redesign of the EMU project to address some of the $aws that were

inherent in its original design and to strengthen its capacity to withstand future crises. As we shall see, as part

- f the redesign the eurozone members have agreed to new rules which have significantly limited their freedom
with respect to fiscal policy to a much greater extent than the originally agreed and largely ineffective 1996
Stability and Growth Pact. !e Fiscal Stability Treaty that was signed on 1 March 2012 and which came into
effect on 1 January 2013 places very tight constraints on the fiscal deficits of eurozone countries. In addition,
there has also been a new intergovernmental organization in the form of the European Stability Mechanism
(ESM) set up to manage future 'bailouts' which strictly speaking had been ruled out in the Maastricht Treaty.
There were also two key reports aimed at strengthening the EMU in December 2012: a report entitled *Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union* was followed by a second report in June 2015 entitled *Completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union*. This has led to two new initiatives to reinforce the EMU framework: the creation of a Banking Union and a Capital Markets Union. The Banking Union has the objective of creating a safer and sounder banking sector, especially for those countries sharing the euro, while the Capital Markets Union has the objective of improving investment and savings flows across the Union to the benefit of businesses and households and to lower the dependence of the eurozone on the banking sector.

In this chapter, we will review the history behind the EMU and spend some time looking at the features and operation of its predecessor, the European Monetary System (EMS), which commenced operations in March 1979 and ultimately proved to be the vehicle for the achievement of EMU. We will describe the EMS and evaluate its performance during its years of operation, including an analysis of the major crises that confronted the system in 1992/93 and the convergence process in the run-up to EMU. We will then look at the economic gains/losses from EMU, including some controversial empirical research on the topic. We review the various safeguards that were originally put into place to ensure that the euro would be a sound low-inflation currency, with particular focus on the Stability and Growth Pact. We will look at the arrangements for the management of the euro under the so-called eurosystem. This is followed by an analysis of the eurozone crisis that started in January 2009 and the required bailout packages for Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Spain. We also look at various solutions being put forward to resolve the crisis. Finally, we look at some of the issues raised by potential new entrants into the EMU, distinguishing between the cases of the United Kingdom and the 12 new countries which joined the EU in 2004 and 2007.

### 16.2 The Snake in the Tunnel

Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, there was a great deal of concern at the community level that if the European Economic Community (EEC) (as it was then called) countries allowed their exchange rates to be determined solely by market forces there might be large and sudden changes in international competitiveness associated with exchange rate movements that could undermine the development of free trade within the community. Indeed, it was feared that there might even be deliberate competitive depreciations by some countries to gain trading advantage, which could result in trade frictions and the emergence of protectionist pressures within the EEC and possibly threaten the existence of the community itself. In addition, following the Werner Report of 1972 (see section 16.14), the member countries of the EEC had set a target date for achieving EMU by 1980. As a result of these fears and a desire to introduce a single currency as well as some degree of exchange rate stability, EEC members set up the so-called 'Snake in the Tunnel' which subsequently became the plain 'Snake'.

The Snake system has been characterized as a mini-Bretton Woods. It commenced operations on 24 April 1972 and was made up of the original six EEC members (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Germany); on 23 May 1972 the UK and Denmark joined and Norway became an associate member. While the member currencies could vary by a maximum of ±1.125% against each other (the Snake) they could float by ±2.25% against the US dollar (the Tunnel) as permitted by the Smithsonian agreement. This smaller margin of fluctuation for the member currencies vis-à-vis each other than was permitted against the US dollar gave rise to the term 'Snake in a Tunnel' to describe the system. Indeed, between 1972 and 1976 Belgium and the Netherlands limited the divergence between their currencies to ±0.75%, and this became known as the 'worm inside the Snake'!

The Snake system had a chequered history; the UK abandoned its membership after just six weeks and was followed four days later by Denmark, which subsequently rejoined in October 1972. Italy withdrew from the Snake in February 1973 and the Tunnel was demolished in March 1973 when the Snake currencies decided on a joint float against the dollar. In April 1973 as part of the Snake system the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF) was set up to provide credits and support for deficit countries. France left the system in January 1974, rejoined in July 1975 and left again in March 1976. Norway left the system in December 1978. Throughout its lifetime the Snake was characterized by a series of devaluations and revaluations which are listed in Table 16.1. This, coupled with the fact that both Italy and France were out of the system, meant that

by 1979 the Snake was looking badly mutilated. In the end, the Snake system failed to produce the necessary degree of coordination of economic policies and convergence of economic performance required for its successful operation.

### 16.3 The Background to the EMS

On 17 June 1978, at a conference held in Bremen, six of the community countries committed themselves to the setting-up of the EMS to replace the Snake. The EMS aimed to provide a 'zone of monetary stability' bringing back into the fold countries like Italy and France which had left the Snake. Before looking at the operation of the EMS it is worthwhile reviewing the motivations behind its formation.

Yao-su Hu (1981) argues that the formation of the EMS has to be seen in a wider context than simply the setting-up of an exchange rate mechanism. He argues that the EMS was based upon a convergence of interests among the EEC countries with regard to a common dollar problem. Under the Bretton Woods system, the dollar was the major international reserve currency, used as a means of settlement between central banks, for exchange market interventions and as a vehicle currency to denominate many international transactions. He argues that the USA was free to run balance of payments deficits to supply the world with the dollars it required. In return for this freedom from balance of payments constraints, the USA was expected to avoid undermining the purchasing power of dollars. When President Nixon suspended dollar convertibility into gold in 1971 the USA had effectively abdicated its responsibility, causing serious economic and financial losses for the Europeans.

The dollar problem had many facets. As the dollar was pegged by foreign central bank purchases of US dollars, this led to a rapid growth in the world money supply and thereby contributed to worldwide inflation. Also, the depreciation of the dollar after suspension of its convertibility meant huge losses for central banks who had purchased dollars under the Bretton Woods system. In return for this freedom from balance of payments constraints, the USA was expected to avoid undermining the purchasing power of dollars. When President Nixon suspended dollar convertibility into gold in 1971 the USA had effectively abdicated its responsibility, causing serious economic and financial losses for the Europeans. In sum, it can be argued that central banks' experience of purchasing and holding US dollars in their reserves had not been a happy one.

Another motivation underlying the Bremen initiative was a desire to provide a stable framework for the conduct of European trade. Since the adoption of floating exchange rates in 1973, there had been very divergent inflation rates, economic growth and balance of payments performances between the EEC economies. European policy-makers were concerned that such divergent economic performances could threaten intra-EEC trade, and it was hoped that stabilizing European currencies would lead to a greater convergence of economic performance and continued growth of European trade.

The EMS commenced operation on 13 March 1979 and, despite much initial scepticism about its survival chances, operated with mixed success for two decades. The EMS consisted of three main features: (1) the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM); (2) the European Currency Unit (ECU); and (3) financing facilities. A proposed European Monetary Fund was never set up. All members of the EEC joined the EMS, though the UK did not initially participate in the ERM. We will now briefly review the three key features as an understanding of these is essential to show how the EMU was eventually brought about.

### 16.4 The ERM

The ERM consisted of two parts:

1. A grid of bilateral exchange rate bands between each of the member currencies which defined obligatory intervention.

2. An individual band of fluctuation (threshold) for each currency against the ECU. The ECU was an artificial currency based upon a calculation of a weighted basket of 12 European currencies. If a currency moved too much against the ECU basket it would lead to the expectation that the authorities of that currency would take policy measures designed to bring it back within its ECU threshold.

_Bilateral exchange rate parities and obligatory intervention limits_

The bilateral exchange rate aspect of the ERM consisted of a grid of central exchange rates between each pair of currencies in the ERM. Originally each currency could fluctuate a maximum ±2.25% of its assigned bilateral central rate against another member currency of the ERM. On the setting-up of the system, Italy was allowed to join with a larger band of fluctuation of ±6%; a similar ±6% was applied when Spain joined in June 1989, the UK in October 1990, and when the Portuguese escudo entered the system in April 1992. However, following an exchange rate crisis on 2 August 1993 there was a widening of permissible fluctuation margins to ±15% for all currencies. Table 16.2 shows the central rates of the grid that also became the fixed bilateral conversion rates between the euro countries announced on 2 May 1998.

Within the bilateral margins authorities could intervene if they wished, though it was not compulsory. **Intra-marginal** intervention was carried out in either EMS or non-EMS currencies (normally the US dollar). Once two currencies reached a bilateral exchange rate margin the authorities of the two currencies were obliged to intervene or take economic policy measures to keep the currencies within their bilateral limits. At the outset of the system, the intention was that obligatory intervention should take place in the relevant EMS currencies rather than in US dollars. For example, if the French franc was at the bottom of its bilateral limit against the Deutschmark, the French and/or German authorities would sell Deutschmarks and purchase French francs rather than the French use dollars to buy francs. An important feature of the ERM was that any changes in the grid of central rates required 'mutual agreement'. In practice, this meant that parity changes were taken by the finance ministers of the currencies participating in the ERM.

### 16.5 The ECU and Its Role as an Indicator of Divergence

A key component of the ERM was the ECU which, between 1979 and 1999, was a weighted basket of 12 member currencies; the 12 currencies being those of the 12 members prior to the entrance of the three new members. The ECU acted as an 'indicator of divergence' within the ERM. Once a bilateral margin was reached,

punt, ITL is Italian lira, NLG is Netherlands guilder, ATS is Austrian schilling, PTE is Portuguese escudo, FIM is Finnish markka.

(b) It is possible to calculate any permanently fixed bilateral parity from the above gird; for example, Italian lira per French franc is

990.2/3.35386 = 295.183, which is also shown in the grid (FRF 1 = 295.183 ITL).

requiring compulsory intervention, a question arose as to which authority was responsible for intervention. In

the case where the French franc reached its lower bilateral limit against the Deutschmark, should the Banque

de France use its reserves or raise French interest rates to support the franc? Or should the Bundesbank sell

Deutschmarks and accumulate French francs and/or reduce German interest rates?

!e ECU was nothing more than a calculation of how a currency was doing against a basket of other

European currencies. !e idea underlying the ECU was that it would single out the currency that was

diverging from the average agreed parities before obligatory bilateral exchange rate margins were reached.

In effect, the ECU was supposed to act as an alarm bell – once a currency crossed its divergence threshold

against the ECU the alarm bell is triggered and the authorities of the diverging currency were expected to

take measures to bring its currency back into line. Such action could consist of a change in interest rates

and/or in the monetary/fiscal policy pursued by the country. Unlike reaching a bilateral exchange rate limit,

triggering the ECU alarm bell did not lead to obligatory intervention, only the expectation of a change in

policy stance ( _presumption d'action_ ). Each currency had its own individual divergence threshold against

the ECU dependent upon its weight in the ECU: the greater the currency's weight, the lower its permitted

divergence threshold. !e reason for designing the divergence threshold like this was to correct for the fact

that currencies with a higher than average weight in the ECU tended to $uctuate less against the ECU than

currencies with a lower weight. !is is because the higher a currency’s weight the more the ECU was made

up of that currency, and since a currency cannot $uctuate against itself the less likely it is to $uctuate against

the ECU. To offset this effect, high-weight currencies were assigned lower divergence thresholds than lowweight currencies. Once a currency deviated too far from its central parity against the ECU basket then

the authorities of that currency were supposed to take measures to bring the currency back into line. For

example, once the Deutschmark exceeded its divergence threshold against the ECU, the German authorities

were expected to take measures to bring it back into line. !e idea was that this warning bell would lead to

action by the responsible country and so avoid reaching obligatory bilateral intervention limits which would

provoke speculation about parity changes.

In practice, the divergence indicator did not necessarily work as intended. For example, it was possible for

four high-weighted currencies in the ECU basket to appreciate against weaker currencies in the system but

keep their same central rate against each other. In such circumstances, they could reach their bilateral parities

against the weaker currencies, even though they had not reached their divergence thresholds with respect to

the ECU.

16.6 FINANCING FACILITIES AND MONETARY COOPERATION

Another key feature of the EMS was that each member of the EMS deposited 20% of its gold dollar reserves

with the EMCF in exchange for the equivalent value in ECUs, the idea being that authorities use ECUs rather

than dollars for their exchange market interventions. Furthermore, since each ECU issued was backed by

dollars and gold it was hoped that ECUs would be extensively used for settlements between EEC central

banks. !e responsibilities of the EMCF were taken over by the European Monetary Institute in January 1994

and by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in 1998.

An important feature of the EMS was that members had access to credit facilities enabling deficit countries

to defend their exchange rate parities and manage transitory balance of payments problems. !ese credit

facilities were as follows:

1. **Very short-term financing:** a credit facility which participating central banks granted to one another.

!is was designed predominately to ensure that EMS members who found their currencies under

pressure had necessary short-term support to intervene to defend their currency. Borrowing had to

be settled within 45 days with the borrower repaying loans made at relevant money-market interest

rates.

2. **Short-term monetary support:** the funds available under this credit facility were intended to meet

financing needs in instances of temporary balance of payments problems. Borrowing was for a duration

    - f three months, renewable for a further two periods at the request of the borrowing central bank.

3. **Medium-term financial assistance:** this facility provided credits for participating countries

experiencing or seriously threatened with di'culties with their balance of payments over the medium

term. Ordinarily no individual country could receive loans of more than 50% of the total committed

ceilings. Medium-term loans were for periods of two to five years and conditional upon the borrower

taking economic and monetary measures aimed at restoring equilibrium to its balance of payments.

16.7 AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EMS

Despite much initial scepticism, many economists were surprised at the resilience and relatively successful

- peration of the EMS. Against this, however, the system was characterized by periods of turbulence making
an overall assessment quite di'cult. !ere are two key areas upon which the EMS has been judged: firstly, as
a zone of currency stability and, secondly, as an anti-in$ation zone.

_Exchange rate stability in the EMS_

In the early days of its operation, some critics of the system viewed it as a 'mere crawling peg', a fixed exchange rate system with bands in which the central parities are frequently realigned. As Table 16.3 shows, in the first four years of its operation, exchange rate realignments were both frequent and quite substantial. To a large extent, the turbulence of the early years was not surprising given that the second oil shock coincided with the inception of the EMS. However, post-1984 realignments became far less frequent and were much smaller. Indeed, between January 1987 and October 1992 there were five and a half years of stability with only a minor devaluation of the central parity of the lira. Cheung et al. (1995) have shown that most realignments in the ERM can be characterized as attempts to restore international competitiveness; that is, move the exchange rate to its PPP level.

Following German reunification and the entrance of the peseta in 1989, the pound in 1990 and the escudo in April 1992, pressures started to build up in the system. In June 1992, a Danish referendum which rejected Danish participation in the EMU raised doubts over continued progress towards EMU and concern in the financial markets about the commitment of certain governments towards economic convergence and the maintenance of their exchange rate parities. In particular, strain brought on by German reunification which had led to high German interest rates to finance its growing budget deficit and keep inflationary pressures under control meant that interest rates for other European countries were forced higher in order to maintain their exchange rate parities, since German interest rates effectively placed a floor on other ERM members' interest rates.

With many European economies in recession, speculators became increasingly sceptical about the commitment of governments to defend their exchange rate parities via high interest rates. Doubts about the result of a French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on 20 September 1992 led to speculative pressure building up on the Italian lira and pound sterling. As a response, both the Italian and British governments issued statements proclaiming they were committed to defending their exchange rate parities. However, due to unprecedented market pressure, the Italians were forced to accept an effective devaluation of the lira of 7% (a combined 3.5%
devaluation of the lira and a 3.5% revaluation of all the other ERM currencies). However, this was regarded as
insu'cient by speculators and on 17 September a further wave of speculative pressure against the lira, pound
and peseta led to the suspension of the pound and lira from the ERM, while the peseta was devalued by 5%.

In November 1992 further speculative attacks led to the escudo and peseta being devalued by 6%. Foreign

exchange market tensions resurfaced in the first half of 1993 leading to a 10% devaluation of the Irish punt in

February 1993 and an 8% devaluation of the peseta and a 6.5% devaluation of the escudo in May 1993. Further

exchange rate tensions built up within the system in July 1993, and in a last-minute bid to save the system and

remove potential 'one-way bets' the bands were widened from ±2.25% to ±15% as from 2 August 1993.

Despite these periodic crises, authors such as Artis and Taylor (1988, 1994) have shown that both nominal

exchange rates and real effective exchange rates had become less volatile for EMS currencies (kroner, Belgian

franc, lira, guilder and Deutschmark) than for non-EMS currencies (the pound, dollar and yen) since 1979

compared with the first six years of $oating. While it is not surprising that nominal exchange rates became

more stable, as this is precisely what the ERM is about, the fact that it also holds for real exchange rates is

indicative of the fact that, as well as providing stability for exchange rates, the EMS has also led to a greater

convergence of in$ation rates.

One of the arguments against adopting exchange rate targets has always been that countries would be

forced to adjust domestic monetary policy and interest rates to the needs of maintaining the exchange rate

target. Hence, exchange rate stability would be achieved only at the cost of increased domestic instability.

Interestingly, Artis and Taylor (1994) found that greater stability of exchange rates was accompanied by

increased stability of domestic short-term interest rates for the ERM countries. It seems that countries derived

both greater domestic and external financial stability from membership of the ERM. By contrast, Artis and

Taylor report that non-ERM countries experienced both greater exchange rate and interest rate volatility

post-1982.

Although the EMS resulted in less volatility of real and nominal exchange rates for its members, there is

clear evidence of significant changes in the levels of real exchange rates over time, particularly in the 1980s. This is because in the 1980s France, Italy, Denmark and Ireland had higher inflation rates than Germany, and the periodic devaluations of their currencies only partly offset these differentials, implying real exchange rate appreciations of their currencies against the Deutschmark. In the 1990s, however, French inflation was generally below German inflation, leading to much more stability of the real exchange rate.

### 16.8 The EMS as an Anti-Inflation Zone

By way of background, before we consider the anti-inflation hypothesis, we should mention that it was a widely held belief that German inflation had generally been lower than that of other EU countries because of the independent status of the German Bundesbank. The Bundesbank was given a charter in 1957 that required it to ensure price stability, enabling it to pursue tough monetary policies regardless of political pressures to inflate. Having experienced two periods of hyperinflation in the twentieth century the Germans have a high aversion to inflation. Only in the 1990s were other central banks, such as the Banca d'Italia (1992), Bank of Portugal (1992), Banque de France (1993), Bank of Greece (1993), Bank of Spain (1994) and the Bank of England (1998), granted similar degrees of independence.

A popular interpretation of the advantages of EMS membership was put forward by Giavazzi and Pagano (1988) and Melitz (1988). According to this interpretation one of the major advantages of ERM membership for relatively high inflation countries such as Italy and France was that participation enabled them to reduce their inflation rates more rapidly, substantially and at lower cost than if they had been non-members.

According to this anti-inflation hypothesis, there are two ways that the fight against inflation was assisted by full EMS membership: (i) by giving the authorities an incentive to bring inflation under control; and (ii) by affecting private agents' wage and price behaviour.

With regard to the authorities' incentives, both Italy and France (and other members) by making a commitment to peg their nominal exchange rates against the key low-inflation currency in the system – the Deutschmark – in effect pledged to bring their inflation rates down to the German level. If their inflation rates remained higher than Germany's then they would be penalized by a loss of international competitiveness. Of course, they could opt for occasional devaluations to maintain their competitiveness, but if France and Italy were to do so too frequently this would signal to economic agents that the authorities were not serious in pursuing anti-inflationary policies. By making a commitment to peg their currencies to the Deutschmark the authorities made a visible signal of their commitment to an anti-inflation strategy. So long as they maintained the peg (tying their hands), they gained some of the anti-inflation credibility of the Bundesbank.

The effect of agents' wage and price behaviour is connected to the authorities' incentive/credibility effect. Given that their authorities maintained the peg, economic agents in France and Italy learnt that persisting with high wage and price inflation demands made their economies uncompetitive. This would ultimately lead to job losses and an economic slowdown. Hence, workers had an incentive to lower their wage demands which in turn resulted in lower inflation. In addition, employers would resist excessive wage demands since if they believed that the authorities would maintain the exchange rate peg they would know that the resulting cost-push pressures would undermine their competitiveness in international markets.

Given the anti-inflation incentives for both the authorities and economic agents, it was argued that membership of the ERM assisted in the process of bringing down inflation compared to non-ERM membership. The Italian and French authorities by being members of the ERM were, according to the anti-inflation hypothesis, able to bring down their inflation rates more substantially and more quickly than could have been achieved without membership.

While the anti-inflation hypothesis explained what was in ERM membership for traditionally high-inflation countries, it did not explain German participation in the ERM. Germany, since the Second World War, had already been a low-inflation country, and the Bundesbank already had anti-inflation credibility. Melitz (1988) argues that the main gain for Germany was that, while the nominal exchange rates were fixed and other countries still had relatively high inflation rates, the Germans experienced an improvement in their international competitiveness due to the resulting real depreciation of the Deutschmark.

This interpretation of the EMS suggests that all countries got something out of the system, but at a cost. The Italians and French managed to bring down their inflation rates and sustain them at lower rates than had they

not joined the system, but at the expense of some loss of international competitiveness. !e Germans probably

accepted a marginally higher in$ation rate than had they not been EMS members but were compensated

by increased international competitiveness. Some empirical evidence on the validity of the anti-in$ation

hypothesis is presented in Table 16.4.

While there is no doubt that average rates of in$ation came down in the EMS countries, Table 16.4 shows

that this is not by itself proof of the EMS anti-in$ation hypothesis. !is is because in$ation rates also fell in the

non-ERM countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In fact, starting from a similar average

in$ation rate in 1980, the in$ation rate in the non-ERM countries was lower than in the ERM countries up

to 1985. Only during 1986–91 did the ERM countries have a lower in$ation rate; between 1992 and 1998 the

non-ERM countries generally had an even lower than average in$ation rate.

!ere have been several more formal empirical studies of the anti-in$ation hypothesis. As is usual in

these studies, it is not possible to prove the hypothesis that the EMS has helped to reduce in$ation because

it is impossible to know what would have happened in the absence of the EMS. !e most popular method of

seeking supporting evidence for the hypothesis has been to compare the EMS countries' in$ation performance

with that of a group of non-EMS countries, as above. Obviously, such a comparison is not conclusive, and the

results can prove sensitive to which non-EMS countries are chosen for comparison. Ungerer et al. (1986)

undertook an empirical investigation of the EMS countries up until 1984 and found that the EMS had a

significant negative effect on EMS in$ation rates. However, a study by Collins (1988), which compared seven

EMS countries' in$ation performance with 15 non-EMS countries, during the periods 1974–78 and 1979–86,

found only limited and inconclusive support for the hypothesis that the in$ation rate had come down more

significantly for the EMS countries for the whole of the period.

Giavazzi and Giovannini (1988) used a different methodology to test the anti-in$ation hypothesis. !ey

exploited the theoretical predictions of what is known as the Lucas critique. In a celebrated paper, Lucas

(1976) argued that statistical relationships will change according to the policy regime in force. In the context

- f the EMS, the change in policy regime represented by the setting-up of the EMS means that the statistical

parameters governing wage, price and output behaviour in the countries studied (France, Italy, Denmark and Germany) should have changed, given the discipline of the EMS. Giavazzi and Giovannini did not find that the statistical relationships changed significantly if mid-1979 was taken as the starting point. If the starting point was taken as the beginning of 1982, there was some weak evidence of a change in wage and price behaviour, providing some support for the anti-inflation hypothesis. The authors suggest that because of large real depreciations of the lira and franc in 1978, the French and Italian authorities did not have to accept the EMS discipline in the early stages of the system. Furthermore, it took economic agents time to learn the implications of EMS memberships and the authorities time to earn credibility. Only then did agents revise downwards their wage and price behaviour.

Overall, it appears that one of the reasons for the lack of conclusive support for the anti-inflation hypothesis is that for the first three years of its operation it is a seriously defective description of the EMS. The differential effects of the second oil shock made authorities very reluctant to accept the discipline of the system, as is amply illustrated by the frequent realignments and the French dash for growth in 1981. It seems that only after 1982 did policy-makers in France, Denmark, Belgium and Italy decide to subject their economies to disinflationary policies. For instance, the French government adopted an austerity package in March 1983 and the Italian authorities repealed wage indexation laws in 1984. The resulting disinflation led to both a rapid decline in EMS inflation rates and to a greater degree of convergence as compared to the group of non-EMS currencies.

### 16.9 Intervention Policy in the EMS

Although the EMS was supposed to result in more symmetry with regard to intervention through the mechanism of the ECU divergence indicator, in practice the indicator did not work particularly well. A study of intervention within the EMS by Mastropasqua et al. (1988) showed some interesting asymmetries and contrasts with respect to intervention behaviour.

The Bundesbank was generally very active with regard to non-obligatory **intra-marginal intervention**. At times, however, particularly when the system was on the verge of realignments (such as in January 1987 and the 1992/93 crises) it was prepared to engage in heavy obligatory **marginal intervention**. The Bundesbank was far more active with regard to the dollar exchange rate: it was a large seller of dollars when the dollar was appreciating during 1980–85 and a large purchaser when it subsequently fell. The other ERM countries were far more active with regard to intra-marginal intervention and keeping their currencies in line with the Deutschmark, which they increasingly used in preference to dollars for such intra-marginal intervention.

The other interesting finding was that the Bundesbank typically sterilized its interventions so that they did not affect the German monetary base. That is, purchases or sales of foreign currency that increased or decreased the German money supply were typically offset by sales or purchases of domestic bonds so as to neutralize the effect on the German monetary base. The other EMS countries normally only engaged in partial sterilization (30–40%) so that purchases or sales of foreign currency resulted in expansion and contraction of their domestic money supplies.

The overall picture that emerges is that the Bundesbank managed the external exchange rate of the ERM currencies against the dollar, while the rest of the ERM members took responsibility for ensuring that they kept their exchange rates in line with the Deutschmark, managing the internal parities. In addition, the Bundesbank by pursuing a sterilization policy generally did not allow its exchange rate policy to influence its money supply and its primary objective of domestic price stability. On the other hand, other ERM countries accepted the discipline of the system by purchasing their currencies when they were weak to keep them in line with the Deutschmark and permitting this intervention to result in a contraction in their money supplies.

Nevertheless, Mastropasqua et al. (1988) emphasized that intervention was only one of the means by which countries maintained their peg to the Deutschmark. The most obvious means was to raise their domestic interest rates when their currencies were under pressure and lower them when the pressure receded. Here, again, there was ample evidence that countries other than Germany undertook most of the adjustment burden, the Bundesbank proving very reluctant to reduce interest rates when the Deutschmark was strong. In practice, far from being a symmetrical system it appears that weak currency members accepted the discipline of the

EMS both with respect to their intervention and domestic economic policies and were prepared to accept the

de$ationary consequences necessary to maintain their exchange rate. In the early years of the system some of

the countries found the discipline too much and realigned their currencies.

16.10 THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF ERM AND NON-ERM COUNTRIES

While there is reasonable agreement that the EMS succeeded in its aim of becoming 'a zone of currency

stability', especially in comparison to currencies that have been le( to $oat such as the dollar, yen and

sterling, there is considerable disagreement over the benefits or otherwise of full EMS membership. Even

if membership of the ERM helped in the fight against in$ation, this may have been at the expense of

countries)having to)adopt de$ationary policies leading to lower economic growth and higher unemployment

than non-members. Table)16.5 shows that economic growth was generally lower for the ERM countries, and

it can also be shown that unemployment rates were generally higher for the ERM countries as compared to

the non-ERM countries.

16.11 WHAT IS MEANT BY ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION?

!ere are two main components to an economic and monetary union between two or more countries: an

exchange rate union and complete capital market integration. By an exchange rate union we mean that the

countries agree to the permanent fixing of their exchange rates with no margin of $uctuation. For all intents

and purposes this is equivalent to the creation of a single currency. Indeed, the creation of a single currency

is the logical outcome of such a situation, emphasizing the permanency of the arrangement. !e second

component of a monetary union is complete capital market integration, which means that all obstacles to the

free movement of financial capital between the union members are removed. Furthermore, capital market

integration requires that equal treatment is afforded to financial capital throughout the members of the union.

While permanently fixed exchange rates and complete capital market integration are explicit requirements

for monetary union, these in turn involve some implicit requirements. One is that the members of the union

harmonize their monetary policies. Differential monetary growth rates once productivity differentials have

been allowed for would lead to differing in$ation rates, which would threaten parity changes undermining

the requirement of permanently fixed exchange rates. When a single currency is brought into circulation,

it requires a union central bank to control its supply and manage the exchange rate of the currency against

third-country currencies. Such a central bank needs to be invested with a pool of foreign exchange reserves

for this purpose.

Hence, a monetary union differs from a fixed exchange rate system in several fundamental respects. A

monetary union is a permanent commitment to peg the exchange rate which logically leads to the creation of

a single currency. Fixed exchange systems allow for occasional realignments and usually permit margins of

$uctuation around a central rate. A monetary union requires a well-developed institutional framework such

as a single union central bank. Finally, within a monetary union financial capital must be allowed to move freely between the members of the union. This contrasts with the experience of some fixed exchange rate regimes whereby exchange rate parities are often defended only by resort to capital controls.

### 16.12 Benefits of Economic and Monetary Union

The benefits and costs associated with the introduction of a single European currency – the euro – as legal tender throughout the EU members of the currency union are in nature a mixture of the political, social and economic.

- **Stimulus to intra-EU trade.** The underlying rationale of the EU is that the removal of barriers to trade by increasing the volume of intra-EU trade will lead to a corresponding rise in the economic prosperity of its members. To maximize the trade flows between the EU member states and achieve a truly single market it is argued that there needs to be a common medium of exchange. Differing national currencies that fluctuate against one another inhibit trade flows by increasing uncertainty facing companies which can only be eliminated by hedging techniques that entail additional (though not substantial) costs for small to medium-sized companies. This argument for a currency union in Europe is particularly important; not only are the European economies particularly open to international trade as a percentage of their gross domestic product, but also a large proportion of their trade is with each other, that is, there is a high degree of intra-European trade.

Against this, some have argued that short-run exchange rate uncertainty can be easily hedged and probably has very little adverse effect on trade (see, for example, IMF, 1984), implying that the benefits from a single currency may be small. However, Peree and Steinherr (1989) have argued that the problem is not really short-term uncertainty which can be easily hedged, but rather mediumto long-term uncertainty (one-year-plus horizon) for which well-developed forward markets do not exist. They find that mediumto long-run exchange rate uncertainty generally exerts a significant adverse effect on international trade. As a monetary union is, by definition, a long-term arrangement, the adverse effects of mediumto long-run exchange rate uncertainty would presumably be eliminated.

A further boost to intra-EU trade comes from the elimination of the transaction costs involved in converting different currencies for such trade. These costs involve the time and resources used up by firms acquiring and selling the requisite currencies and banks' commission charges. The European Commission has estimated the cost savings from elimination of these transaction costs to be around 0.4% of EU GDP per annum. It should be noted, however, that this would involve smaller profits for banks. Box 16.1 describes controversial research on the impact of monetary unions on trade flows.

- **A more efficient allocation of factors of production within the EU.** EMU involved not only the creation of a single European currency, but also the removal of capital controls and distortions to the treatment of financial capital among EU countries. There is no doubt that the free movement of capital within the EU has in the past been distorted by capital controls and differing national treatments of financial capital, which has led to a suboptimal allocation within the Union. Capital controls have typically restricted capital from moving to countries where it has a low marginal productivity to countries where it has a high one. The permanent abolition of exchange rate controls and the absence of uncertainty created by exchange rate fluctuations has undoubtedly led to a more

**Box 16.1 The impact of a monetary union on trade**

In a controversial paper, Rose (2000) estimated that the effects of a currency union could increase trade

by as much as 300% in the countries he studied where currency unions had come into being, comparing

the volumes of trade to countries that did not have a common currency. !e paper has come in for

much criticism since it was focused on relatively poor and/or small nations that had formed currency

unions and its applicability to the case of the EU is doubtful, although it nonetheless suggests that the

effects of creating a single currency in Europe could be quite significant. In a follow-up paper, Glick and

Rose (2002) examine the impact of a currency union on those countries that adopt a common currency

using panel data (a mix of cross-sectional and time-series data) and find that it doubles the volume of

trade, which is a considerably lower impact than in the original Rose paper yet still highly significant.

In a recent paper, Micco et al. (2003) using post-1999 data argue that the euro had already increased

trade in the region by 4 to 16%, depending upon the particular methodology used. !ese estimates,

while significantly lower and more realistic than those of Rose (2000) and Glick and Rose (2002),

are nonetheless significant and suggest that the creation of the euro has had a significant economic

impact. !ey also find that the creation of the euro, as well as stimulating intra-eurozone trade, has also

increased extra-eurozone trade (that is, trade with non-euro members). Another interesting finding

is that the impact of the euro on trade $ows really began in 1998, a whole year prior to the actual

permanent fixing of exchange rates.

e'cient allocation of capital within the Union. Similarly, with wages and salaries expressed in terms

    - f a common currency, EMU will result in a better allocation of labour as the latter moves from areas

    - f low-marginal to high productivity regions.

 - **Economizing of foreign exchange reserves and seigniorage benefits.** Dollar Treasury bonds held in
EU member reserves typically earn low rates of interest, with their purchasing power in terms of US
goods being eroded over time by US in$ation. Economizing on the amount of reserves held would
reduce the seigniorage benefits accruing to the USA. Some argue that EMU will reduce the total
foreign exchange reserve holdings of EU countries, since there is no need to hold reserves to manage
intra-EU exchange rates. Furthermore, there is a good chance that the euro will tend to $uctuate less
against third-country currencies than the individual EU currencies. !e reasoning is that the average
economic performance of many countries with the same currency is likely to be more stable than that

	- f the individual countries with their own currencies, implying less need to hold foreign exchange
reserves. In addition, the euro will inevitably become a major world currency, leading to an increase
in the European currency component of non-EU countries' reserves, primarily at the expense of the
US dollar, resulting in corresponding seigniorage benefits accruing to the EU. Cohen and Wyplosz
(1989) have estimated that the gains accruing to the EU from this latter effect could amount to
around 0.75% of EU gross national product. Additional benefits are:

 - **Savings in administrative costs for businesses.** !is is a potentially significant benefit for firms
involved in managing their exchange risk and operating their businesses in many different European
currencies. Different European currencies and $uctuations between them have meant that firms use
up resources in having to monitor their exchange-risk exposure and in revising their pricing strategies
in the different European markets. !e existence of the euro has considerably reduced these costs.

 - !is is less talked about but is a
**Greater liquidity and rationalization of financial markets.**
potentially important benefit of EMU for the eurozone area. Prior to the euro, national government
bond and equity markets, while generally very liquid, were to some extent segmented from one
another. Post-EMU, all government debt of the member countries has been denominated in euros
and this has made the government bond markets even more liquid and resulted in a lowering of
transaction costs. Furthermore, there has already been a significant rationalization of equity markets:
now company stocks are all quoted in euros with more equity business done on the most e'cient
exchanges. !e access to cheaper sources of finance and improved liquidity for both governments and
companies is a potentially significant benefit from EMU.

- **Greater price transparency.** Another gain from having a single currency is that consumers and businesses benefit from price transparency. Now that all prices in the eurozone countries are quoted in euros it is more difficult for manufacturers to maintain significant price differentials in different markets. Consumers buying from the cheapest sources will, over time, help to ensure that a single pricing policy biased towards the lower end of the prices charged in different countries is adopted by many multinationals. This implies a potential benefit for consumers and businesses at the expense of reduced profits for some multinational companies.

### 16.13 Costs of EMU

Most of the perceived costs of EMU are not so much associated with the final attainment of monetary union, but rather with the transitional costs associated in achieving it:

- **Loss of monetary autonomy.** The use of a common currency with a European Central Bank, charged with determining monetary policy and the short-term interest rate on the euro, is the most visible sign of the main cost associated with EMU. Since EMU has involved the introduction of a single currency with no capital controls, then a single short-term interest rate has prevailed in the eurozone countries. This means real dilemmas for the European Central Bank when setting interest rates, as it has to reconcile the needs of booming member states with those of member states suffering from recession. In the absence of EMU, national central banks in booming countries would typically raise the short-term interest rate to dampen economic activity, while those of countries in recession would usually reduce the short-term interest rate to boost economic activity. A common interest rate in the post-EMU era may be insufficiently high to curtail economic activity in booming countries while being too high to help countries in recession.

- **Loss of national macroeconomic policy autonomy.** A major argument against EMU is that the acceptance of a single currency means that countries are no longer free to determine their own monetary policies and inflation rates. In economics it is widely believed that in the short run a trade-off exists between inflation and unemployment, known as the Phillips curve. Some countries prefer to have low inflation rates and are prepared to accept relatively high unemployment, while others prefer low unemployment and relatively high inflation. With floating exchange rates these different inflation preferences can be reconciled by an appreciating currency for low-inflation countries. Since a monetary union requires common inflation rates, countries with differing preferences with respect to any unemployment–inflation trade-off will lose from monetary union. This argument is illustrated in Figure 16.1 that compares the UK and eurozone Phillips curves.

**Figure 16.1** UK and eurozone Phillips curves

Assume that UK policy-makers prefer relatively high inflation, while the eurozone prefers less inflation. The optimal inflation–unemployment trade-off for the UK is given by _P_ UK* and _U_ UK*, while the optimal trade-off for the eurozone area is _P_ E* and _U_ E*. In a monetary union both have to accept a common inflation rate _P_ U, which implies higher UK unemployment than UK policy-makers prefer, and higher eurozone inflation than the eurozone countries prefer. However, there is much debate in economics over whether the Phillips curve trade-off exists. Most economists accept that in the short run such a trade-off usually exists but in the long run does not, with each country having a vertical Phillips curve at its natural rate of unemployment. Hence, the costs associated with the loss of national policy autonomy are probably confined to the short run.

- **Loss of inflation tax.** German agreement to EMU was crucially dependent upon guarantees of a low inflation rate in the union. For some governments, especially the 2004 accession countries, the move to EMU is potentially costly because it is necessary to bring their inflation rates down and into line with the low eurozone rate. This undermines their implicit inflation tax revenue. In countries where there is a large amount of outstanding public debt and a large holding of the monetary base, as opposed to interest-earning bank accounts, the inflation that results from reducing the real value of both the outstanding debt and the purchasing power of the authorities' monetary base liability effectively constitutes a tax. The lower EMU inflation rate implies a smaller inflation tax revenue for high-inflation countries, meaning that their governments will have to replace the lost inflation tax with explicit direct and indirect taxes. In an analysis of this argument, Cohen and Wyplosz (1989) calculated that the taxation of the monetary base was far more significant for some countries than others. In particular, assuming a constant 5% inflation rate, the inflation tax as a percentage of GDP was 2.1% for Ireland, 3.9% for Italy and 3.5% for Spain, but only 1% for Germany, 1.1% for France and 0.7% for the UK and the Netherlands. Furthermore, since Italy and Spain are among the most heavily indebted countries, the temptation to inflate and reduce the real value of outstanding debt was higher in those countries. It should be noted that although explicit taxes tend to be politically more unpopular than hidden taxes, such as 'inflation taxes', from an economic viewpoint the replacement of inflation tax by more explicit taxes is not necessarily a bad thing.

 - **Regional disparities.** Another concern over EMU is that while it will probably lead to gains for
the EU as a whole, some countries could gain while others could lose. !e increased movements

	- f capital and labour associated with EMU, as factors move from low marginal productivity areas
towards high productivity areas, could manifest as a regional problem with undesirable social
effects. !is may be particularly important with respect to labour movements, because labour that
leaves low productivity areas is usually the most mobile and productive part of a region's workforce.
To mitigate such adverse regional effects may require a corrective EU regional policy, with those
regions and countries that gain funding compensatory measures in regions that have lost from EMU.
Although some regional disparities may emerge as a result of EMU, it is very much open to debate as
to whether regional policy is the best means of alleviating the problem. Regional policies have fallen

	- ut of favour in recent years for a whole host of reasons; these include political manipulation, the
diversion of funds to ine'cient industries and the delaying of desirable economic adjustments. In
practice, it is di'cult to assess whether a region is in decline because of EMU or for other reasons.

 - **Loss of the exchange rate policy instrument.** Another argument employed against EMU is that the
member countries, by agreeing to a fixed exchange rate within the union, are depriving themselves of
both the exchange rate policy instrument and monetary policy instruments. Tinbergen's instruments–
target rule (see **section 4.13** ) argued that policy-makers generally require as many independent
instruments as they have targets. !e loss of the exchange rate policy instrument and ability to pursue
an independent monetary policy does not matter if the authorities have only one objective, because
they could use fiscal policy to achieve internal balance. However, this leaves the problem of external
balance. !e question of whether the authorities are really losing a policy instrument for dealing with
external equilibrium is not clear-cut. !is is because, for the eurozone as a whole, there is nothing
to prevent the euro $oating vis-à-vis currencies of the rest of the world to ensure that the balance of
payments of the eurozone is kept in equilibrium. Nevertheless, overall external equilibrium for the
eurozone disguises the fact that some member countries may experience persistent deficits and others
persistent surpluses. !e loss of the exchange rate policy instrument is therefore applicable to the
individual eurozone countries.

 - **Transition costs.** !ere are inevitably some transition costs involved in EMU. !ese range from the
costs of calling in existing national notes, the printing of new notes, education and training, changing
information technology systems to cope with the new currency, and altering existing automated
telling and vending machines. !e European Banking Federation (1995a) estimated the costs of the
transition to be 25–40 billion ECUs or roughly 2% of bank costs. !ese are largely 'one-off' costs,
and against these we need to offset certain future benefits such as economies of scale that result from
manufacturers having to deal with only one currency and banks having to deal with fewer currencies,
and so on.

Overall, it is clear that there are some advantages and some disadvantages attached to EMU. Even if the

benefits exceed the costs this does not necessarily imply that EMU is in any sense optimal. !e number of

countries and which ones would constitute an optimal EMU is an open question. Another point to bear in

mind is that there may well be some countries and firms that are winners and others that are losers from

EMU, for which the benefits may be spread thinly over many millions of people throughout the Union, while

the losses are heavily concentrated in particular sectors or countries. Another very important point when

considering the benefits and costs associated with EMU concerns the characteristics of the new European

currency. If the euro turns out to be a low-in$ation and well-managed currency with responsibility for its

issue in the hands of a credible, independent, well-managed ECB, then the case for EMU is strengthened. If,

407

International Finance

however, the euro turns out to be a weak, in$ation-prone currency run by a poorly managed ECB then the

case for EMU is correspondingly weakened. Finally, for past and future potential member states the precise

costs and benefits depend partly on the conversion rates of their currency against the euro – to the extent that

a currency is overvalued in relation to, say, PPP this increases the real purchasing power of the country, but

against this the country may suffer a loss of competitiveness which could contribute to a post-EMU recession

in that country.

16.14 A HISTORY OF THE ROAD TO EMU

!e Treaty of Rome 1957 which created the EEC made no explicit mention of monetary union; however,

the architects of the Treaty no doubt envisaged the EEC eventually developing into a fully-$edged economic

union with full monetary integration among its members. At the time of signing the Rome Treaty, the priority

was the creation of a customs union which involved the adoption of a common tariff policy vis-à-vis third

countries and the removal of trade barriers (especially tariffs) between member countries. By 1968 much progress had been made in these areas and it was believed that a means of further increasing trade between members would be the creation of a single European currency. At the Hague Summit of December 1969 the then six member countries of the EEC agreed in principle to establish complete economic and monetary union in stages, commencing in January 1971 and being completed by the end of 1980. Although in retrospect such a target seems absurdly ambitious, it must be remembered that the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates had been operating with only occasional realignments for two decades.

_The Werner Report_

As a result of the Hague Summit of 1969, a committee was set up to investigate the subject, and in 1972 it delivered the so-called Werner Report on Economic and Monetary Union. The report envisaged a full-fledged monetary union between the members of the EEC by 1980. In relation to the free movement of factors of production the report argued for the removal of all impediments and distortions to such movements. The report foresaw the conduct of fiscal and monetary policies being carried out at the community level by community institutions invested with the necessary decision-making powers, the main aim of such institutions being to regulate the monetary and credit policies of the union and manage the external exchange rate vis-à-vis non-EEC currencies. Fiscal policy would be employed to ensure both economic stability and growth. Finally, community institutions would also operate regional and structural policies designed 'to contribute to the balanced development of the community'.

The main result of the Werner Report was the Snake in the Tunnel arrangement of 1972 which, as we have seen, had a very poor track record and was all but finished by 1978. Apart from being overambitious, there were more fundamental reasons for the failure to achieve EMU by the target date. In the first instance, the six original members were joined by Ireland, the United Kingdom and Denmark in 1973. Their accession negotiations and the ensuring of their successful integration into the EEC inevitably took precedence. In addition, as we saw in Chapter 11, the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates broke up in 1971 and was swiftly followed by the first oil shock of 1973/74. The impact of the oil price rise was not spread evenly, and coinciding with the new era of floating exchange rates meant that countries were free to adopt different policy responses. Some countries, such as the UK and Italy, adopted expansionary policies in a bid to stave off recession, while others such as Germany were determined to avoid inflation and adopted deflationary policies. With such policy divergences and resulting differential inflation rates any hope of achieving fixed exchange rate parities between European currencies was soon vanquished. During the period 1971–75 French consumer prices rose by 52%, while in Germany they rose by 34.7% and in the UK by 82.5%.

Ultimately, the principal obstacle to monetary union was that the heads of state that met at the Hague Summit failed to deliver the political will and commitment necessary for its achievement. To a large extent they misunderstood the full implications required to achieve EMU. Put simply, the declaration to achieve EMU only had a real chance of success if the member states were prepared to sacrifice the macroeconomic control of their national economies to achieve common inflation objectives – but the political will to do this was never present.

_EMS and the Delors Report_

The EMU project was clearly flagging when in 1978 the President of the European Commission Roy Jenkins suggested that an EMS be set up to provide a zone of currency stability for the European currencies. As we have seen, the EMS had a mixed performance in its early days and was not initially viewed as a vehicle for achieving EMU. However, in 1986 Europe passed the Single European Act with the aim of creating a single market by 1992. This in turn led to an inevitable debate about whether a single market would be best served by a single currency. At a meeting of the European Council in June 1988, the Heads of Government of the member countries of the EEC confirmed the long-run objective of economic and monetary union. A committee of academics and central bankers headed by Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, was set up to investigate the EMU issue and propose a strategy for achieving it. The result of the deliberations was the so-called Delors Report of 1989 which set out a broad outline proposal for achieving EMU. The Delors Report emphasized that member states would have to be prepared to transfer decision-making powers to community institutions in the field of monetary policy and be bound to preset procedures and rules in other areas such as fiscal policy. In particular, it emphasized the need not only for convergent monetary policies, but also for convergent fiscal policies. The report argued that monetary union requires a single currency rather than just irrevocably fixed parities. A single currency would demonstrate the irreversibility of the move to monetary union, would considerably facilitate monetary management within the community and would avoid the transaction costs of converting currencies. An EU Central Bank was viewed as a necessity to operate monetary, credit and interest policy rather than close coordination between existing central banks. Full liberalization of capital markets and financial market integration were also viewed as essential.

!e Delors Report took it for granted that the benefits of EMU would exceed the costs, and it was the remit

- f the committee to draw up a set of proposals relating to how such a process might be achieved. !e report
envisaged the attainment of EMU in three stages, each stage representing a significant change with respect to
the preceding one. !e report did not set out explicit deadline dates, but it was subsequently decided by the
European Council meeting in Madrid in June 1989 that Stage 1 would begin on 1 July 1990. Prospective dates
for Stage 2 (1 January 1994) and Stage 3 (1 January 1997 or 1 January 1999) were later agreed at Maastricht and
by the European Council in Madrid in December 1995. !e three stages were as follows.

_Stage 1: the convergence phase_

!e first stage lasted from 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1993 and aimed at providing the necessary foundation

upon which to build EMU, especially a greater convergence of economic performance and enhancing economic

and monetary coordination amongst member states within the existing EMS institutional framework. !e

409

International Finance

main features of this stage were the completion of the Single Market project, a strengthening of community

policies to iron out regional imbalances, greater cooperation and coordination of monetary and fiscal policies,

the removal of obstacles to financial integration including the removal of all obstacles to the private use of the

ECU, and all members of the EMS joining the ERM.

_Stage 2: the transition phase_

!e second stage began on 1 January 1994 and represented a transition phase aimed at ensuring the readiness

- f national economies for the eventual permanent fixing of exchange rate parities. !is stage required
amendments to the Treaty of Rome and resulted in the Maastricht Treaty. !e basic organs and structure of
economic and monetary union were set up, involving both the revision of existing community institutions
and the establishment of new ones. !e major institutional development in this stage was the establishment

- f the European Monetary Institute (EMI) in Frankfurt on 1 January 1994 to prepare the groundwork for
the implementation of the final phase. !e EMI had two main tasks: (i) to assist progress on economic
convergence by strengthening coordination of monetary policies between EU central banks, the so-called
ESCB, with the aim of ensuring price stability; and (ii) to make preparations for the final phase, for example
by working on issues such as the statute of the Central Bank, the ESCB, note and coin design, financial sector
issues, dissemination of information, and so on.

!e ESCB absorbed the previously existing monetary arrangements (the EMCF and Committee of Central

Bank governors). !e key task of the ESCB was to begin the transition from the coordination of independent

national monetary policies to the formulation and implementation of a common monetary policy by the

ESCB itself. Upon EMU in 1999, the ESCB assumed full control over the formulation and implementation

- f the community's monetary policy, including day-to-day decisions on exchange market interventions with
respect to third currencies.

_Stage 3: the fixing and euro phase_

!e Maastricht Treaty stipulated two possible starting dates for the permanent fixing of exchange rates:

either 1 January 1997 or 1 January 1999; since the 1997 date was missed, 1 January 1999 became _de facto_

the new starting date. Members that met the so-called Maastricht conditions would move to irrevocably

locked exchange rates with national currencies subsequently being replaced by the euro. From 1 January

1999 the members of the currency union became subject to a single monetary policy set by the ECB.

In addition, rules and procedures relating to the community in the macroeconomic and budgetary field

became binding. !e ECB was given full control over the formulation and implementation of the eurozone's

monetary policy.

16.15 THE MAASTRICHT TREATY

As a follow-up to the Delors Report, the Maastricht Treaty was signed in the Dutch town of Maastricht

in December 1991 and, following ratification in the parliaments of all EU countries, came into force on

1)November 1993. !e Maastricht Treaty was in part a collection of additions and amendments to the Treaty of

Rome, covering political and economic reform. It provided the legal basis to establish the institutions required

for EMU; for instance, allowing the formation of an ECB. !e Treaty also set out the conditions under which

a country would be eligible for joining EMU. Only countries that meet all four of the following conditions, the so-called 'convergence criteria', had the right to join the EMU at the outset, and these conditions also apply to prospective new EMU entrants (see section 16.31):

1. Average consumer price inflation in the country should not be more than 1.5% above that of the three countries with the lowest inflation rates;

2. A country should not have an excessive budget deficit, with the reference rate being that it should not exceed 3% of GDP;

3. The outstanding public-sector debt (national debt) of the country should not exceed 60% of GDP;

4. Average nominal long-term interest rates in the year of examination should not be more than 2% above that of the three countries with the lowest inflation rates.

It should be noted that in respect of the Maastricht criteria there were two big let-out clauses. Firstly, in respect of fiscal deficits a country might be permitted to join with a deficit above 3% of GDP if 'the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to the reference value; or, alternatively, the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the ratio remains close to the reference value'. Secondly, in respect of the levels of national debt, a country might be permitted to join the EMU with national debts above 60% if 'the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace'. The latter let-out clause became very significant when the European Commission made its assessment of eligible entrants in 1998.

In addition to the four criteria, the currency of a country was expected to have respected normal margins of fluctuation and not have been devalued within the ERM in the two years prior to a country joining EMU. The United Kingdom and Denmark were in a different position from the other EU countries since they were not required to join EMU even if they met the convergence criteria. The United Kingdom negotiated an 'opt-out' which was set out in a Protocol attached to the Treaty. The Protocol stated that the UK was not obliged to join Stage 3 without a separate decision by its government and Parliament. Denmark decided not to join Stage 3 but had the right to revoke this decision in accordance with its constitution. Subsequently, it was agreed that actual (not forecast!) 1997 data would be used for assessing which countries were eligible to join EMU in conjunction with forecasts for 1998, the decision being taken by a qualified majority vote in May 1998. Sweden effectively made itself ineligible for EMU entrance by not permitting the krona to participate in the ERM system for the two years prior to EMU.

### 16.16 An Evaluation of the Maastricht Criteria

The Maastricht criteria were primarily motivated by a German desire to ensure that the qualifying members for EMU had a strong fiscal and monetary background. Having an ECB with voting members made up from countries with a sound financial background was viewed as an essential foundation for ensuring that the euro would turn out to be a sound currency with similar attributes to the Deutschmark. Another way of saying roughly the same thing was that the Germans were keen to exclude countries with a poor economic record and a high propensity to print money when faced with economic difficulty (such as Italy and Greece).

While the basic idea of including only countries with sound economies and sound fiscal policies as a basis for ensuring a sound monetary union has significant merits, the Maastricht criteria have been subjected to numerous criticisms.

One criticism was that the Maastricht criteria were very arbitrary both in relation to the targets set and the targets chosen. The choice of 3% for the budget deficit to GDP ratio and 60% for the government debt to GDP ratio were clearly arbitrary – the limits could easily be raised to say 3.5% and 80% respectively without creating a confidence crisis and permitting more founding members. In addition, in the run-up to EMU there was evidence that some governments were massaging their fiscal deficits to meet the criteria.

Another major criticism was that the national debt criterion was not really appropriate since it looked only on the liability side, ignoring state-owned assets. A government could have a high national debt, but the value of state-owned assets might mean it has a low net liability or even a positive net asset position; whereas a government with a lower national debt might have relatively few state-owned assets and a lower net asset position relative to its GDP. Many have criticized the choice of targets as being only financially oriented, having nothing to say on the real economy, such as economic growth, the balance of payments and the rate of unemployment. Indeed, the narrow focus on financial criteria may have imposed an excessive degree of fiscal austerity on Europe in the run-up to EMU, implying higher unemployment and lower economic growth, than would otherwise have been the case.

A significant critique of the Maastricht conditions was made by Paul De Grauwe (1996), who pointed out that countries like Italy and Belgium would have less of a public debt problem and lower fiscal deficits if they were allowed to join the EMU. This is because outside of EMU they had to pay high interest rates on their public debts since financial markets feared that they would resort to printing money to repay their debts,

and as such they had a significant in$ation risk premium built into their interest rates. In a monetary union

they would have a lower in$ation premium to pay since they would not be able to print money to redeem

their national debts which would be denominated in euros. In turn, lower interest rates would enable them to

lower their fiscal deficits since they would reduce the financing cost of the national debt which is part of this

year's fiscal deficit. In other words, high government debt countries could more easily meet the Maastricht

conditions as members of EMU than if they were excluded.

A further argument levelled against the Maastricht conditions is that the convergence criteria were not

really that important and that they distracted attention from more important fundamental issues. !e

Maastricht Treaty itself has a so-called 'no-bailout' clause that makes it clear that government debt is the

responsibility of the government that issues the debt; in legal terms other member states are excluded from

'joint and several liability'. As such, it can be argued that the Maastricht conditions were not really necessary

since each government that joins EMU is responsible for its own debt and governments will have to be prudent

so as to ensure that their debt rating is not undermined by credit-rating agencies.

Another problem with the Maastricht conditions is that there were plenty of 'before' conditions but no

'a(er' conditions, which to some extent was illogical. A country might behave well before joining the monetary

union to qualify for membership and then misbehave a(er joining. A realization of this problem motivated

the Germans to demand that the Maastricht conditions be extended to cover the behaviour of countries a(er

they joined EMU. More specifically, they negotiated a so-called Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) to cover the

post-EMU era.

16.17 THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT

In the run-up to EMU the German government began to realize that selling the EMU project to a sceptical

German public would be extremely di'cult without any post-EMU guarantees on fiscal deficits. In particular,

the Germans feared that countries might get their budget deficits down to meet the Maastricht fiscal criteria,

but a(er EMU fiscal laxity would undermine confidence in the new euro.

At a summit held in Dublin in December 1996, the Germans secured the SGP, designed to ensure that

fiscal prudence remained in place following the start of EMU. !e pact subjects countries running 'excessive'

412

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

fiscal deficits (defined as a deficit above 3% of GDP) to fines unless they take action to get their deficits

down. Each member state of the monetary union had to prepare a multi-annual stability programme setting

- ut its budgetary position, which requires endorsement by the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers
(ECOFIN), and make it public. Implementation of the programme is monitored by the Commission and
ECOFIN which can recommend policy adjustments if the plans are not adhered to.

If a country is deemed to have an excessive deficit the Commission prepares a report and sends it to

ECOFIN; and if the Council believes the deficit to be excessive it will recommend that the member state take

corrective action within four months with a view to correcting the deficit within 12 months of its occurrence.

If the measures are not implemented or are deemed to be insu'cient, the member state must make a noninterest-rate bearing deposit with the ECB ten months a(er the notification. If the deficit remains excessive

the deposit is converted into a fine two years later.

There are exceptions in which a deficit may be above 3% of GDP without incurring a fine. Most importantly, if the member state has suffered a sharp economic downturn, defined as an annual fall of real GDP of 2%, then the deficit is considered exceptional and does not trigger any action. In general, a fall of less than 0.75% in GDP is not considered exceptional, while a fall of between 0.75% and 2% in GDP is subject to the judgement of the Council. Other exceptions, i.e. unusual events outside of the country's control, such as a national catastrophe which has a major impact on the member state's financial position.

The penalty initially takes the form of a deposit to be placed in a special Community budget account, which is convertible into a fine after two years if the country fails to bring down its annual budget deficit. The maximum penalty in any one year is 0.5% of GDP; in the first year the deposit is a fixed portion of 0.2% of GDP and a variable portion of 0.1% for every 1% above the 3% threshold. If the deficit persists in the second year, additional variable portion sanctions can be levied up to a ceiling of 0.5% of GDP.

### 16.18 The Changeover to the Single Currency

In November 1995 the EMI published a document entitled 'The Changeover to the Single Currency', setting out the transition process. The document envisaged three periods for the transition:

- The first period (scheduled for May 1998) involved the selection of the countries that met the Maastricht criteria and were therefore eligible to join EMU.

- A second period (1 January 1999) involved the permanent fixing of the bilateral rates between the member currencies and announcement of their conversion rates to the euro. At the start of the second period the EMI was to be liquidated and replaced by the ECB and the ESCB, comprising the ECB and existing national central banks; the purpose of the ESCB being to conduct a single monetary policy for the euro area and to maintain price stability by setting appropriate short-term interest rates for the euro. The ESCB would be responsible for both money-market and foreign-exchange operations for the euro. The euro was to be used in banking operations alongside the existing national currencies, but one of the guiding principles of the second period was 'no compulsion, no prohibition', that is, no company/bank was to be compelled to use or prevented from using the euro or existing national currencies. This meant that banks were free to make transactions and offer services in the euro but would only be compelled to do so in the final period. In addition, all contracts denominated in ECUs were to be legally replaced by the euro on the basis of one ECU being equal to one euro.

- A final period (starting on 1 January 2002) was the introduction of euro banknotes and coins alongside existing national notes and coins for a maximum period of six months. Both were to be legal tender and anyone was able to exchange on demand their national currency for euros at commercial banks or the national central banks. At the end of the six months and no later than 1 July 2002, it was planned that national notes would cease to be legal tender (although exchangeable for euros at national central banks) with the euro becoming the sole legal tender in the participating countries.

By and large, the timetable envisaged in the changeover plan was successfully followed. On 25 March 1998 the European Commission and EMI published their convergence reports recommending that 11 countries – Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain – be admitted to EMU. Then in May 1998 during a meeting of the Heads of State held in Brussels the formal decision was taken to admit these countries and the bilateral exchange rate parities were fixed at the central rates prevailing in the ERM as shown in Table 16.2. It was not possible to announce the rates against the euro since the pound sterling was floating against the currencies; and since the pound was part of the ECU then the currencies were still fluctuating against the ECU. On 1 June 1998 the ECB formally came into being, replacing the EMI.

On 31 December 1998 the conversion rates to the euro were announced, based on the then prevailing exchange rates of the currencies against the ECU. Hence the ECU moved from being a mere calculation to a real currency, called the euro, at a parity of one ECU to one euro. The final announced conversion rates of the national currencies to the euro are shown in Table 16.6 and are the permanently irrevocably fixed rates

that prevailed from that point onwards for financial market transactions and for when the national currencies

were to be replaced by actual euro notes and coins as from 1 January 2002.

On 19 June 2000 the Council of Ministers judged that Greece had fulfilled the convergence criteria and

approved its accession to the euro area as the twel(h member, starting on 1 January 2001. New member states

joining the monetary union since then include Slovenia (1 January 2007), Cyprus and Malta (1 January 2008),

Slovakia (1 January 2009), Estonia (1 January 2011), Latvia (1 January 2014) and Lithuania (1 June 2015). Box

16.2 looks at some of the logistical matters associated with bringing actual euro notes and coins into existence.

**Box 16.2 The practicalities of introducing the euro**

Although EMU commenced in January 1999 with the irrevocable fixing of exchange rate parities, euro

notes and coins were actually introduced at street level on 1 January 2002. Approximately &132 billion

worth of notes and &37.5 billion of coins were brought into circulation. !e distribution of the coins

required the equivalent of 1,000 one-ton trucks making the equivalent of 100,000 journeys. Some

3.2 million vending machines needed converting, requiring at least one man-hour to convert each to

accept new notes and coins. However, the actual introduction of euro notes and coins went surprisingly

smoothly, and within 20 days there was a near 90% usage of the euro in the eurozone area.

16.19 THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EURO IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

When the euro first came into existence it had a parity of approximately \$1.17/&1, and many economists

expected it to strengthen. But contrary to expectations, in the first few years of its existence the euro exhibited

a marked decline against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market, trading as low as \$0.82/&1. However,

as Figure 16.2 shows, once the euro hit the streets in 2002 it made a dramatic recovery, rising to as high as

\$1.58/&1 in the foreign exchange market in June 2008. However, since the financial crisis and in particular

the eurozone crisis, the euro has exhibited more weakness and by earky November 2022 it was trading at

around)\$1/&1.

### 16.20 The Eurosystem

The overall decision-making structure and control of monetary policy in the eurozone is carried out in the framework of the eurosystem. The eurosystem comprises the ECB and the 19 national central banks (NCBs); the governing bodies of the eurosystem are the Executive Board and the Governing Council. The Executive Board consists of the president, vice president and four directors of the ECB, while the Governing Council is made up of the six members of the Executive Board and governors of the 19 NCBs. The Governing Council is the main decision-making body and formulates monetary policy for the eurozone area, taking decisions on interest rates, reserve requirements and the provision of liquidity to financial markets and institutions. The Governing Council meets every two weeks in Frankfurt and each of its 25 members has one vote; the Executive Board implements decisions taken by the Governing Council including giving instructions to the 19 NCBs. So, while the decision-making process is highly centralized, the implementation process is in fact quite decentralized with the NCBs carrying out the decisions in their national money markets.

The independent ECB has been modelled on the Bundesbank. Indeed, De Grauwe (2003) argues that the language used by the drafters of the statutes on the ECB was tougher on inflation and political independence than the statutes of the Bundesbank. The ECB has a statutory duty to ensure 'price stability', whose definition was left to the ECB to define: 'the primary objective of the ECB's monetary policy is to maintain price stability. The ECB aims at inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term'. While the objectives of the ECB are laid out in the Maastricht Treaty, Article 105 in particular makes it clear that the prime objective is price stability, though it permits the ECB 'without prejudice to the objective of price stability' to take into account general economic policies within the eurozone area, including levels of employment, though these are very much secondary to the main objective. From its _Monthly Report_ it is quite clear that the ECB itself regards its sole objective as being the maintenance of price stability.

The Maastricht Treaty is very clear on the political independence of the ECB, and Article 107 states that:

When exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by this Treaty … neither the ECB nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any Government of a Member State or from any other body.

The independence of the ECB has been secured by several means. Firstly, the Maastricht Treaty conditions, which can themselves only be modified by unanimous approval of all EU member states. Secondly, the minutes of its Governing Council meeting – when it sets the target level of short-term interest rates for the euro – are not published, nor is the voting record of its members – this protects national central bank governors from fear of job losses for not voting the way that their national governments would like. Finally, the ECB is also prohibited from printing money to finance any member state's fiscal deficit. There have been criticisms about the potential lack of accountability of the ECB, but it has made some moves to dispel such criticisms. For instance, the President of the Bank holds a press conference after every meeting of the Governing Council to explain its interest rate policy; the ECB also publishes its _Monthly Report_ which explains in some detail the basis of its policies.

While the ECB has a target rate of inflation of close to 2%, it has made it clear that this is a medium-term target (the precise time period is not defined) and as such it can permit this target to be exceeded in the short run. Indeed, in the first 285 months of the euro the 2% inflation target was exceeded in 116 of the months (that is, 40.7% of the time); however, the deviations were not generally substantial except for a period during September 2007 to October 2008 when it was above 3% with a peak of 4.0% in June and July 2008, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine it peaked at 10.7% in October 2022. In fact, during the period January 1999 to October 2022 covering 285 months, the monthly average annualized rate of inflation was 1.84%. The behaviour of the inflation rate in the eurozone is depicted in Figure 16.3. The ECB uses an intermediate monetary targeting system to achieve its inflation target, and in particular it has set a reference value for the rate of growth of the M3 money supply in the eurozone of 4.5% per annum, though it permits the reference value to be exceeded or undershot so long as the inflation target is likely to be met over the medium term. The main policy decision of
the Governing Council is to set the _refinancing rate_ which is the rate of interest at which it will provide liquidity
to the banking system in exchange for eligible reserves such as euro-denominated Treasury bills.

Authors such as De Grauwe (2003) have made a number of criticisms of the in$ation target; in particular, it

is regarded as too low since the actual reported in$ation rate may overstate the real in$ation rate by anywhere

from 0.5–1.5% because of quality improvements. Also, since it is an in$ation target for the eurozone area as a

whole there may be widely divergent in$ation rates between members of the eurozone, with in$ation below

2% in some, such as Germany, but slightly higher than 2% in others, as can be seen in Figure 16.4, where

countries like Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain have seen their consumer price indices rise significantly

relative to Germany since the commencement of EMU. !is implies a major loss of competitiveness in these

economies relative to Germany, especially in the case of Greece.

!is loss of competitiveness is also re$ected in the deterioration of their current account deficits as a percentage

- f GDP, while Germany's current account improved significantly due to its increasing competitiveness as
depicted in Table 16.7, only starting in 2013 did the current accounts of the PIIGS start to improve.

16.21 THE FAILURE OF THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT

!e SGP was supposed to act as a constraint on fiscal deficits post-EMU; however, as shown in Table 16.8,

German and French fiscal deficits exceeded the SGP requirements in 2003 and 2004, meaning that initial

deposit fines should have been levied on both. However, the two countries successfully blocked such attempts,

and this to a large extent undermined the credibility of the SGP. Fines can be imposed only when a two-thirds

majority of the Council of Ministers (finance ministers) approve their imposition, and France and Germany

blocked attempts by smaller countries and the Commission to impose the fines. !e failure to enforce the SGP

- n the big countries, and a feeling that the SGP imposes an unduly harsh fiscal straitjacket upon countries that
need to stimulate economic growth by running larger than 3% fiscal deficits for a certain period of time, led
to an intense debate on how to reform the SGP.

One suggestion was to pay attention to the size of public debt. If a country has a low level of national debt then it could be permitted to exceed the 3% fiscal deficit criterion for a period of time, whereas a country with a high national debt would be expected to keep to the 3% limit. As Table 16.9 shows, there are very large variations in countries' debt levels, which have all worsened considerably since the onset of the 2007 financial

crisis, the PIIGS crisis and the covid-19 pandemic. Another suggestion is to pay more attention to the cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit; in the case where an economy is growing below trend, its headline deficit may be above 3% but its cyclically adjusted deficit might be below 3%, whereas when the economy is growing above trend, its headline figure may be below 3% while its cyclically adjusted figure might be above 3%. Other proposals include raising the fiscal deficit above 3% to, say, 4%, or permitting it to average 3% over the economic cycle, thereby allowing a country temporarily to exceed 3% without necessarily incurring a fine. The credit crunch and eurozone crisis eventually led to the so-called Fiscal Compact which is covered in section 16.28.

### 16.22 The ERM II

When the ERM I ceased to exist on 1 January 1999, ERM II came into being principally so that Greece that had not qualified for EMU and Denmark that had decided not to join could continue to maintain stable currencies against the euro members. The ERM II is also relevant to the accession countries that joined the EU in May 2004, as joining ERM II for two years is an essential precondition for participation in EMU itself.

Despite having the same fluctuation bands as ERM I of ±15%, ERM II is not a carbon copy. ERM II has four key features: (1) it is based on central rates fixed for participating currencies vis-à-vis the euro and therefore has no parity grid – the normal band of fluctuation being ±15%; (2) there exist obligatory interventions once margins are met; (3) the ECB and all participating 'pre-in' central banks have the right to initiate procedures to review the central rates; and (4) access is provided to short-term financing facilities with the ECB having the right to suspend intervention and financing operations. In practice, a country that joins ERM II can request a lower margin of fluctuation, and such has been the case with Denmark that currently operates a ±2.25% band against the euro. Any accession countries are expected to spend a *minimum* of two years in ERM II prior to their adoption of the euro. As at November 2022, the EMU has 19 member countries and there are three members of ERM II as depicted in Table 16.10.

### 16.23 PIIGS and the Eurozone Crisis

Once the monetary union commenced in 1999, it was essential that to maintain their competitiveness vis-à-vis Germany, countries like Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain (PIIGS) would need to keep their inflation rates in line with Germany. However, this was not the case, as shown in Figure 16.4. This loss of competitiveness over time, with the consequent problems for the export sector, meant that the PIIGS economies were more vulnerable than countries like Germany when the global financial crisis started in 2007.

While UIP implies that very short-term interest rates such as three-month Treasury bill rates will be equal

in a monetary union (since the expected change in the exchange rate is equal to zero, as the countries have the

same currency, and assuming the probability of default on three-month Treasury bills is zero), this is not the

case for long-term bond yields within a monetary union. When countries are locked together in a monetary

union, the member countries cannot unilaterally print money to redeem their debt. As such, investors in

debt of the various countries of the monetary union have to factor in the possibility that a country that has

issued bonds may default on its obligations. For example, one country may have a AAA credit rating and

can therefore borrow for ten years at, say, 4% while another country may have only a BBB rating indicating a

higher probability of default and so may have to pay 5.5% on a ten-year debt that it issues. In a sense, countries

in the monetary union become like companies within a country: those with the best credit rating and lowest

probability of default will be funded at a lower yield than those companies with lower credit ratings and a

higher probability of default. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Christopher Sims has succinctly put it

at an IMF conference:

!ere is a very important distinction between in$ation risk and default risk. !ere is a kind of a default

premium. An entity that issues debt that only promises to pay paper that it can print for free, is free

  - f any risk that the entity will be unable to deliver on the contract terms. It's one thing for markets to
worry about unpredictable in$ation reducing the value of a bond. Another thing is for the markets to
be uncertain whether at the next rollover this issue of debt is going to not be fully paid or whether there
might be a general haircut on debt.

!e risks to holders of debt of an unspecified form of default is much more disruptive than the

risk of losing some of the value of the debt through unpredictable in$ation. And I think that's why

even though on fundamentals the UK and the US and Japan look like they're in as much trouble as

European countries, nonetheless those countries can print what they promised to pay. So there's no

short-term risk of a sudden, unpredictable allocation of losses across different bondholders. (Reuters,

23 April 2012)

Prior to the outbreak of the credit crunch in August 2007 the premium on PIIGS debt over German

ten-year bonds was relatively modest, as depicted in Figure 16.5, but once the credit crunch got under

way their loss of competitiveness since joining EMU relative to Germany, and the relatively high levels of

government debt, combined with a very significant widening of their fiscal deficits, made the participants

in the financial markets worry about the sustainability of their government fiscal positions. As such, there

were speculative)attacks launched first upon Greek bonds and then on Irish and Portuguese bonds. As shown

in Figure 16.5, the bond yields of the PIIGS over Germany widened considerably, especially in the cases

- f Greece, Ireland and Portugal, starting around January 2009. To some extent the speculative attacks on
these three countries became self-fulfilling in the sense that as interest rates on their debts rose, given their
debt profiles, the probability of default increased markedly, especially given their relatively low prospective
economic growth)rates.

16.24 THE BAILOUTS OF GREECE, IRELAND, PORTUGAL AND SPAIN

Although the Maastricht Treaty explicitly ruled out the use of bailouts through the so-called 'no bailout clause',

which states that members are not jointly or severally liable for the debts of the other member states, a bailout

- f Greece, rather than allowing it to default on its obligations, came to be seen as a necessity. !e main reason
for this was that it soon became apparent that French and German banks held over 70% of the Greek debt.

!ey had held large holdings of Greek debt as part of their capital requirements because it had been giving

a slightly higher yield than German bonds. As such, a default by the Greeks would have severely impacted

- n the viability of the French and German banking systems. In addition, there was a fear of the spread of
contagion: if Greece were to default it would then perhaps lead to speculative attacks on other vulnerable
countries such as Ireland and Portugal with the real fear being that it could eventually engulf a large country
such as Spain and Italy who were deemed to be 'too big to rescue'. If Greece defaulted, the feeling was that
speculative attacks against the debts of the other PIIGS could raise their yields to such high levels that they
too would be forced into defaults.

!e background to the build-up of Greek debt goes back quite some time. It should be remembered that

Greece was allowed to join the EMU in January 2001 despite then having a national debt to GDP ratio of 104.7%

rather than the 60% ratio that would have been in strict compliance with the Maastricht Treaty conditions. In

the run-up to Greece joining the eurozone, Greek ten-year bond yields fell significantly from 19% in January 1999 to only 5.3% in January 2001 when the country officially joined. The Greek governments used these very low yields to borrow even more, especially to help finance the Olympic games held in Athens in 2004. Another persistent problem in Greece was over-employment in the public sector combined with a poor system of tax collection and a culture of significant tax evasion by its citizens that meant a structural borrowing problem had built up over time. A further problem was that Greece appears to have been deliberately underreporting the state of its public finances.

The problem of the build-up of debt was fully exposed once the credit crunch got under way. The rapid rise in unemployment meant reduced tax collection and greater fiscal outlays. This, combined with a large cumulative fall in 2008–12 of GDP of around 20%, meant the fiscal deficit rose from 6% in 2006 to 15.6% in 2009 along with a projected fiscal deficit of 7.4% for 2012. The national debt as a proportion of GDP also rose rapidly due to a combination of the high fiscal deficits (which add to the national debt) and the falls in GDP. Both the shipping and tourism industries in Greece were particularly badly affected by the slowdown in global trade.

The first Greek rescue package was arranged on 2 May 2010 with a bailout of €110 billion: the 16 eurozone countries contributed €80 billion and the IMF €30 billion, the loans being made at an average yield of around 5.2%. The bailout was made conditional upon Greece taking significant austerity measures designed to get its fiscal deficits down, including a rise in VAT from 21 to 23%, a 10% rise in fuel, alcohol and tobacco duties and larger cuts in public salaries and pensions of over 20%. On 7 May 2010 the Greek government passed a package implementing a €30 billion reduction in its fiscal deficit over the following three years. In a bid to reduce the risk of contagion from Greece to other economies the EU/IMF agreed to set up a European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) with an initial effective endowment of €250 billion (raised in July 2011 to €440 billion), the idea being that the EFSF could issue bonds, which would be guaranteed by the eurozone countries, and use these funds to lend to the PIIGS if necessary. The idea of the EFSF was to provide immediate liquidity for Greece, Ireland and Portugal that would help forestall further speculative attacks. In July 2011 the EFSF was given permission to use some of its capital buy bonds on the secondary market in a bid to contain bond yields.

The initial bailout of Greece did little to restore confidence in the financial markets as it became increasingly clear that the Greek national debt level projected to reach 160% of GDP was unsustainable, especially as bond yields on the debt were skyrocketing (ten-year yields were approaching 32% by the end of November 2011). As such, it became apparent that the Greek debt level would need to be both reduced and restructured, the hope being that resolving the Greek situation would prevent contagion to other markets such as Portugal and more importantly Spain and Italy. Once it became clear that the Greek debt level would need to be reduced and restructured, the key questions became:

- Who would suffer losses from the restructuring and how much losses would they be obliged to accept?

- Would the Greek deal be classified as an orderly 'voluntary' restructuring deal or a disorderly default?

- What economic reforms and policies would Greece have to adopt to ensure that it would be able to repay the remaining debt and keep its restructured public finances on a longer-term fiscal sustainability?

A second Greek rescue package was arranged in March 2012 with the eurozone countries and IMF

agreeing to lend a further &130 billion. In the second bailout, under German pressure the creditor banks

were forced to accept substantial losses of &109 billion on their holdings of Greek debt in order to reduce the

Greek debt levels. !e second bailout package offered creditors a wide menu of options including a 'voluntary'

programme to convert existing bonds into 30-year bonds. Also, the interest rate bill expected of Greece from

the previous bailout was reduced by 0.5% for the first five years and 1.5% therea(er (similar reductions were

also allowed for Ireland and Portugal). In the second Greek bailout, most private-sector debt holders took

losses of some 77% of the net present value of their bond holdings.

!e Irish bailout was necessitated by the dramatic impact of the credit crunch and the ending of its housing

bubble which led to the virtual collapse of its banking system. During the period January 2000 to the end of

2006 Irish house prices rose a staggering 116.7%, having already more than doubled between 1995 and 2000.

Irish banks had in the background built up a huge loan exposure to the Irish property market. Once house

prices started to fall and non-performing loans started to rise, the viability of the Irish banking sector was

called into question. !e Irish government was forced to step in and nationalize all but one of the six major

banks and guarantee their deposits. !e massive bailout of these banks substantially raised the national debt

- f Ireland and resulted in a massive increase in its fiscal deficit for fiscal year 2010 to a staggering 31.2% of
GDP. !e fall in the Irish GDP meant that the ability of the Irish government to pay back its debt was called
into question and the yield on its bonds rose dramatically.

On 21 November 2010 the Irish government yielded to the inevitable and agreed to a bailout package

- f &85 billion. !is new money was made available on condition of the country enacting a severe austerity
programme made up of &15 billion of cuts over four years, including &6 billion in budget cuts, and tax rises for
2011, including savage wage and pension cuts combined with a reduction in the minimum wage. !e target

- f the austerity programme was to reduce the Irish fiscal deficit down from 31.2% to less than 3% of GDP for
fiscal year 2014.

Following the Irish bailout Portugal became the next target for speculators to attack. Portugal was

vulnerable because of its national debt exceeding 85% of GDP and its high fiscal deficit which was projected

at over 9% for 2011. On 4 May 2011, Portugal received a &78 billion bailout at an average interest rate of 5.1%

- n the condition that it reduce its budget deficit from 9.1% of GDP to 5.9% immediately for the fiscal year
2011 and reduce it to 3% by 2013. !e bailout terms included: rises in sales, property and health service taxes;
the duration of unemployment benefits being cut to 18 months from three years; and cuts to state pensions
that are over &1,500 (\$2,217) a month. !ere was also agreement to privatize TAP Air Portugal, the airport
management company ANA, the national mail company CTT, and government stakes in energy company
EdP and national electricity distribution company REN. In addition, major public works projects, such as a
high-speed rail link to Spain, were postponed.

On 5 August 2011 Italian and Spanish bond yields reached new peaks of over 6%, calling into question

the viability of their sovereign debt. Following an announcement by Standard and Poor's on 5 August 2011

that the United States sovereign debt would be downgraded from AAA to AA+ there was real fear that when

the markets reopened on 8 August there would be carnage in the bond and stock markets. To forestall the

425

International Finance

speculative attacks the ECB Governing Council met over the weekend and, under the aegis of its Securities

Market Programme, agreed to buy Spanish and Italian bonds. !e immediate impact was a fall in the ten-year

bond yields from 6.09 to 5.44% on Italian bonds and from 6.04 to 5.32% in the case of Spain, with rises in their

stock markets of 3.2 and 4.1% respectively.

During April to June 2012 attention in the financial markets increasingly started to focus on Spain.

Spanish banks had extended enormous amounts of loans to the Spanish property sector since the turn of

the century, resulting in a construction boom and housing bubble. When this burst, Spanish banks had a

large amount of dubious loans on their books. !e probability that a Spanish government bailout of Spanish

banks might be needed meant that Spanish government bond yields started to rise, reaching 6.53% by the

end of May.

Spanish banks had found themselves involved in a credit and property boom from the turn of the century,

during which they lent huge sums of money to finance residential and commercial property. As is usual

in a housing bubble, prices went up and there was a belief that they would continue upwards; there was

- verbuilding. When prices reached unaffordable levels they started to decline and many property projects
were abandoned before completion. !is meant that non-performing loans in the banks and _cajas_ (saving
institutions) started to rise dramatically. !e initial reaction was to conduct stress tests in July 2010 and,
although five out of 27 banks were deemed to have insu'cient capital, the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors report nonetheless concluded that 'the exercise confirms that the Spanish banking system is
sound, and in turn substantiates the savings bank restructuring and recapitalisation process pursued over
the past twelve months by the Bank of Spain'. In fact, the tests were wholly unfit for purpose. A second round

- f stress tests in July 2011 found five banks failing to pass the tests, yet the Spanish banking system was still
deemed to be in a good state. Another response was to merge seven weak _cajas_ into a new bank named
Bankia that was sold off via an Initial Public Offering process to the Spanish public on 18 July 2011. Within a
year reality began to hit home. On 28 May 2012 Bankia collapsed, and on 7 June Spain's sovereign rating was
downgraded three notches to BBB.

As fears for the Spanish banking system increased and the yields on Spanish government debt rose,

Spain agreed on 9 June 2012 to accept funding from the EFSF and its successor the European Stability

Mechanism (see later) of up to &100 billion of loans to recapitalize its banking system. While the funding

was to be administered by the Spanish Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring it was ultimately guaranteed for

repayment by the Spanish government. !e hope was that the funding would help to stabilize the Spanish

banking system.

16.25 THE COVERED BOND PURCHASE PROGRAMME

Many European banks were suffering as a result of the credit crunch that had started in 2007 and were finding

it di'cult to restore their capital ratios as the credit markets had generally dried up for bank funding. To help

improve banks' access to funding the ECB governing council announced in May 2009 that it would permit

the ECB to purchase up to &60 billion of covered bonds (debt backed by pools of assets) on both the primary

and secondary markets. !e initial Covered Bond Purchase Programme (CBPP) was completed by June 2010.

!en, due to further problems as the effects of the eurozone crisis took hold, a second CBPP programme

was announced (CBPP2), authorizing the ECB to purchase another &40 billion of banks' bonds by the end of

October 2012. !e prime aims of the programme were to ensure medium-term funds for struggling European

banks and to improve liquidity in the bank bond market.

  - f credit protection (previous purchasers continue to pay &500,000 per annum). As such, rises in CDS
spreads can be taken as a sign that protection sellers are increasingly concerned about the risk of a
credit event. As can be seen in Figure 16.6, the sovereign CDS spreads on the PIIGS debt increased
significantly as the eurozone crisis rolled on.

One interesting point concerning CDSs on sovereign bonds is that you do not have to own the

sovereign debt to buy the protection against a credit event. So, if a hedge fund manager feels that a

sovereign will default a(er one year, then he or she can purchase a CDS for, say, a premium of &500,000

per annum. If the country defaults a(er, say, one year, as predicted, then the manager can simply buy the

defaulted bonds with a face value of &10 million for, say, &3.5 million and deliver them to the protection

seller, so making a net profit of &6,000,000.

16.26 THE SECURITIES MARKET PROGRAMME

On 14 May 2010 the ECB announced the establishment of its Securities Market Programme (SMP), justified

by article 18.1 of the statute setting up the ESCB, which allows the latter to 'operate in the financial markets

by, among other things, buying and selling outright marketable instruments'. !e prime motivation of the

SMP was to contain the ever-rising bond yields on the Portuguese, Irish and Greek debt; in August 2011 it

was expanded to include both Spanish and Italian debt. !e SMP involved ECB purchases of PIIGS sovereign

bonds, both on the primary market and secondary market. !e policy was largely justified by the need to

prevent the risk of their Spanish and Italian debt yields rising to dangerously high levels, which would require

some sort of bailout to be arranged, and to prevent the risk that this would present to the euro itself. Under

the SMP, purchases of PIIGS debt were sterilized by offsetting sales of Treasury bills to sterilize the impact of

the purchases on the European money supply. Some &22 billion of securities were purchased under the SMP

between May 2010 and March 2012.

Despite the pros of the SMP in providing liquidity for the PIIGS bonds and in helping to contain yields,

there were also considerable concerns about the programme. In particular, the buying of such large amounts

- f PIIGS debt meant the ECB was assuming the risk in the event that the PIIGS were to default. In addition,
in the second Greek debt restructuring, the ECB was seen as a senior creditor and its bond holdings were
not subjected to any writedown. A(er this became apparent, the private-sector debt holders started to worry
about further ECB debt purchases of PIIGS debt, since that would mean that their debt holdings would be
increasingly at risk in the event of any future restructuring. !e SMP programme was replaced on 6 September
2012 with the outright monetary transactions programme (see section 16.30).

16.27 THE LONG TERM REFINANCING OPERATION (LTRO)

Between August 2011 and December 2011 there was increased speculation concerning the possibility of Greece

and perhaps other countries being forced out of the eurozone (in the case of Greece this was termed a 'Grexit'). It

also became apparent that the ECB policy of keeping a lid on Spanish and Italian bond yields by purchasing their

government bonds – the SMP – was increasingly being called into question by German o'cials, two of whom

resigned from their positions in the ECB in protest. Following the ending of his term of o'ce, Jean-Claude Trichet

was replaced by the Italian Mario Draghi in November 2011. !ere followed a significant change of policy with

interest rates cut from 1.5 to 1%. More significantly, in December 2011 the ECB announced it would lend some

428

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

&489 billion of funds for three years to European banks at an interest rate of 1%. !is was followed by a second

round of funding in February 2012, when 800 banks borrowed a further &529.5 billion. !is policy was dubbed the

Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) and the combined lending under the facility totalled over &1 trillion.

!e LTRO ensured that at least for the next few years no European bank would go under due to liquidity

issues, since they could simply meet these needs by borrowing from the ECB. !is was particularly important

for Greek and Spanish banks that took full advantage of this. !e funds were then invested in government

bonds, so having the effect of reducing Italian and Spanish bond yields. Some of the funds were also used to

buy back existing bank debt, taking advantage of the lower cost of the LTRO funds. !e liquidity effects and

confidence generated by the programme also boosted stock markets that had a strong first quarter to 2012.

However, further doubts about Greece's chances of remaining in the euro following the election in April

meant that most of these gains were wiped out during May 2012.

Although the LTRO addressed the immediate liquidity needs of banks it was not universally welcomed,

being depicted as: further monetary easing; subsidizing the banking sector; allowing insolvent banks that

needed nationalization and/or recapitalization to continue to trade; and perhaps delaying governments from

undertaking the necessary fiscal reforms by indirectly and artificially boosting the demand for their bonds.

It also exposed the European taxpayer to significant risk of losses as the ECB was effectively increasing its

exposure to the European banking sector. Over the period of the credit crisis and eurozone crisis the balance

sheet of the ECB expanded massively from \$1.138 trillion in January 2007 to \$2.980 trillion in May 2012, as

shown in Figure 16.7, due to its liquidity intervention and asset purchases. !e Covid-19 pandemic eventually

led to the ECB's balance sheet expanding to close to \$9 trillion.

16.28 THE FISCAL COMPACT

Following the Greek bailout, it was evident that the SGP had proved inadequate as a means of containing fiscal

deficits and national debt build-ups. As such, from mid-2010 the Germans pressed for a new treaty to address

the fiscal $aws in the EMU project. On 2 March 2012 a Treaty on the Stability, Coordination and Governance

in the Economic and Monetary Union was signed by all members of the EU except the Czech Republic and

the United Kingdom. It is better known as the Fiscal Stability Treaty or Fiscal Compact. !e Fiscal Compact

took effect from 1 January 2013 and required its signatories to introduce legislation to have balanced budgets

- r fiscal surpluses within one year or the European Court of Justice will be able to levy a fine of 0.1% of GDP.
Only countries that had the Fiscal Compact as part of their legal code by March 2013 were eligible to apply for
bailout money from the ESM. !e main provisions of the Fiscal Compact are:
Fiscal budgets should be in surplus or balanced and the structural budget deficit must not exceed

0.5% of nominal GDP. However, countries with national debts below 60% and long-term sustainable
public finances can run structural fiscal deficits of up to 1% of GDP.

2. Member states with national debts above 60% of GDP will reduce these debts towards the reference

value at an average rate of one twentieth per annum.

!e European Court of Justice will be able to fine a country that does not adopt a standardized

balanced budget rule in its constitution, the equivalent of up to 0.1% of GDP. !e fine goes either to

the ESM (if a euro country is fined) or to the general EU budget (if a non-euro country is fined).

4. Member states agree to take the necessary actions and measures, 'which are essential to the good

functioning of the euro area in pursuit of the objectives of fostering competitiveness, promoting

employment, contributing further to the sustainability of public finances and reinforcing financial

stability'. !ey also agree to ensure that all major economic policy reforms that they plan to undertake

will be discussed _ex ante_ and, where appropriate, coordinated among themselves and with the

institutions of the EU.

!e Fiscal Compact was clearly much tougher than the SGP and the inclusion of the national debt criterion

to some extent remedied a crucial defect of the SGP which failed to recognize that countries with low national

debts are generally speaking in more fiscally sustainable positions than countries with high national debts.

Of course, there are concerns that the Pact requires too much fiscal austerity over time constraining potential

economic growth.

16.29 THE EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM

!e hastily arranged bailout funds EFSF and ESM lacked any basis in European law and on 16 December

2010 an amendment to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union was added, which declares

that 'the member states whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if

indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. !e granting of any required financial

assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality'. On 2 February 2011 a formal

Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism was signed, which entered into force in July 2012.

!e ESM is an intergovernmental organization headquartered in Luxembourg. !e fund, totalling around

&500 billion, was made up of contributions from the then 17 eurozone countries, based on their 2010 GDPs

and replaced both the EFSF and EFSM. !e ESM was expected to work in conjunction with the IMF in any

bailouts of eurozone member states with strict conditions applied to any loans. !e hope was that the ESM,

430

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

by having a pool of money to bail out countries, would make speculators wary of launching a speculative

attack. A eurozone country facing a short-term liquidity problem can apply for emergency funding from

the ESM provided it accepts the fiscal austerity programme and related conditions set out. Nonetheless, if a

member state's debt position was regarded as unsustainable, it would be expected to enter negotiations with

its creditors to restructure its debt as a condition for any bailout funds.

16.30 'WHATEVER IT TAKES' AND OUTRIGHT MONETARY TRANSACTIONS

A real turning point in the eurozone crisis came on 27 June 2012 when the Head of the ECB Mario Draghi in a speech in London made the following statement:

We think the euro is irreversible. And it's not an empty word now, because I preceded saying exactly what actions have been made, are being made to make it irreversible. But there is another message I want to tell you. Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.

The irreversible references and the 'whatever it takes' phrase had a remarkable impact on financial markets as it clearly demonstrated that the ECB would take all necessary measures to keep the eurozone intact and signalled a preparedness of the ECB to use its resources and powers to take on any speculators betting on a breakup of the eurozone. The impact on financial markets was immediate with interest rates on bonds issued by the PIIGS falling. While the initial impact on yields was to lower them, during late August interest rates in the PIIGS debt were beginning to rise again and on 6 September 2012 the ECB, worried about the rising bond yields in Spain and Italy, announced that it was engaging in a new policy called Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) which would allow it to buy government debt in the secondary markets in unlimited amounts if necessary. The idea was that this would help to lower bond yields in countries such as Spain and Italy. However, such purchases would be conditional on countries adopting strict conditionality with regard to fiscal policy under the ESM and IMF programmes. Any OMT purchases would be sterilized in that for every €1 billion of government debt purchased the ECB would sell €1 billion of securities, so that there would be no monetary base implications from the programme. This means it is not part of the quantitative easing programme which does affect the monetary base. Interestingly any bonds purchased by the ECB under the programme would be treated on an equal basis ( _pari passu_ ) as other bond holders. The initial market reaction was very favourable with Italian and Spanish bond yields falling over 50 basis points within the first few days of the announcement and a study by Altavilla et al. (2014) argued that the OMT programme, although never used, through its announcement effect and extra confidence that it engendered, decreased Italian and Spanish two-year government bond yields by approximately 2% while leaving German and French twoyear bond yields unchanged. The legality of the OMT programme was challenged by the German Federal Constitutional Court as being contrary to German and EU law; however, the European Court of Justice in June 2015 ruled that the OMT programme was legal since it 'does not exceed the powers of the ECB in relation to monetary policy and does not contravene the prohibition of monetary financing of EU nations'.

### 16.31 Proposals to Resolve the European Debt Crisis

There have been various proposals put forward to resolve the European debt crisis, motivated by the desire to avoid the risk of contagion that would result from a formal default by one or more of the PIIGS, the real fear being that a default by one of the smaller PIIGS could ultimately result in major speculative attacks against Spain and Italy, which are too large to rescue and whose default would in turn result in financial turmoil by undermining the European banks that have large holdings of sovereign debt on their balance sheets.

_Structural reform_

An obvious proposal is for the countries that are heavily in debt to undertake real structural economic reform

to improve the competitiveness of their economies so that they can grow out of their debt problems. Measures

such as privatization, reduction of their bloated public sectors, reductions in state benefits and entitlements,

labour market reform (for example, a reduction in minimum wages and trade union powers) and other

so-called supply side measures could help to improve longer-term economic growth and with it the fiscal

dynamics of the countries. However, such policies are easier said than done and usually meet with strong

public resistance requiring significant economic sacrifice in the short run, even though they may improve

things in the longer run.

_Debt forgiveness/restructuring_

Another proposal is simply to make the bond holders take a 'haircut' on the sovereign debt they have bought

so as to make the debt repayments for countries like Portugal, Ireland and Greece more sustainable. !e idea

is that lower debt service repayments would mean the countries would be able to grow more rapidly as money

can be diverted from debt service repayments to other purposes such as improving infrastructure, education

and health services. Of course, it is the option least preferred by most creditors as it would mean losses on

their loans being realized and in the case of banks this implies falls in their share prices, the need to raise new

capital and in some cases questions their viability.

_The issuance of common E-bonds (Eurobonds)_

In an article published in the _Financial Times_ - n 5 December 2010 Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister

- f Luxembourg, and Giulio Tremonti, the treasury minister of Italy, proposed the setting up of a European
Debt Agency as a successor to the EFSF that would issue E-bonds backed by all the governments of the
eurozone, with each country permitted to issue these bonds to the value of 40% of its GDP. !e idea is that
countries could switch some of their existing debt for newly issued Eurobonds at a lower cost of finance, since
the Eurobond debt would be guaranteed for repayment by countries with a stronger fiscal position such as
Germany. In addition, private holders of already issued public debt could switch some of it for Eurobonds at
a discount to the face value of the debt.

!ere are many merits to the Eurobond proposal; in particular it would create a very liquid market for the

bonds and more transparency in banks' balance sheets as those that chose to swap existing debt in the PIIGS at a

discount to its face value would have safer capital on their balance sheets and their actual losses would be clearer.

More importantly, for the PIIGS, they would be able to reduce their debt service payments as the Eurobonds

would presumably have significantly lower rates of interest. !e main disadvantage is that countries like

Germany may find the interest rate at which they borrow would actually rise as their potential exposure to the

PIIGS debt was factored in by the financial markets. !e proposal is also at odds with the Maastricht no-bailout

clause in that in part members would be jointly and severally liable for the debts of other members and as such

would require a revision to the Treaty. Also, it is highly likely that Eurobond issuance would require European

level tax-raising powers so that repayment of the bonds could be guaranteed. In other words, Eurobonds would

need to be accompanied by a fundamental shi( in fiscal powers, including tax raising at the European level.

432

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

Since the original Eurobond proposal was launched there have been various other proposals to issue common

Eurobonds issued by an EMU Fund (or a European Debt Agency bond issuing authority), but with countries

paying back different rates of interest on access to funds raised via the bonds. Boonstra (2010), for example,

proposes that countries pay a premium rate of interest over countries like France and Germany, depending on the

size of their fiscal and national deficits relative to the averages of low deficit and national debt countries like France

and Germany. Another proposal by Delpla and von Weizsäcker (2010) is that common Eurobonds be issued to

cover, say, the first 60% of a country's national debt with the remainder to be covered via a separate bond of the

national member states. !e common Eurobond would attract a much higher credit rating and therefore a lower

interest rate, while any other debt would be issued by the national government with, in the case of the weaker

member states, a higher rate of interest, re$ecting their poorer credit ratings and the more junior status of these

bonds. Overall, the result should be lower servicing costs of national debt while creating incentives for countries

to get their fiscal deficits and national debts down. Also, the higher liquidity of Eurobonds would be attractive,

as it would lower the liquidity premium required, compared to the current issuance of separate national bonds.

_Allow the ECB to print euros to guarantee debt repayment_

Another proposal is to change the statute of the ECB to enable it essentially to print money to redeem the

debt of the PIIGS if necessary, rather than allow an actual default and the risk of contagion that would follow.

!e argument is that the eurozone member countries have no real alternative other than to default when

their national debts become 'unsustainable', resulting in financial market participants being tempted to make

speculative attacks that can be self-fulfilling. If the ECB was authorized to purchase bonds as they matured then

this would reassure sovereign bond holders in the eurozone that they would likely get their promised coupons

and principal back. Of course, this would mean that there is a risk that the ECB would be seen as monetizing

sovereign debt which, if so, might lead to higher interest rates on sovereign bonds in traditionally low in$ation

countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. To avoid the perceived risk of monetization of debt

there would need to be some constraints on the size of fiscal deficits and issuance of debt to prevent countries

issuing huge amounts of debt, knowing that the debt could ultimately be monetized by the ECB.

16.32 FIRST EMU REFORM PLAN (2012–15)

In December 2012 a report entitled _Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union_ envisaged strengthening

the EMU in three stages:

**Stage 1: Ensuring fiscal sustainability and breaking the costly link between banks and sovereigns**
**(2012–13).** !is involved improving _ex ante_ cooperation via the Fiscal Compact, establishing a single
supervisory mechanism as a precursor to a banking union, capital requirements and directive and regulation
and harmonization of national deposit guarantees as well as a new framework for the European Stability
Mechanism to conduct direct bank recapitalization.

**Stage 2: Completing the integrated financial framework and promoting sound structural policies**
**(2013–14).** !is involved completing the banking union, by establishing the Single Resolution Mechanism
(SRM) as a common resolution authority and setting up the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) as an appropriate
financial backstop. !ere was also established a new 'mechanism for stronger coordination, convergence and
enforcement of structural policies based on arrangements of a contractual nature between Member States and
EU institutions on the policies countries commit to undertake and on their implementation'.

**Stage 3: (2015 onwards) Improving the resilience of the EMU through the creation of a shock-absorption**
**function at the central level.** !e key aim here was to establish a well-defined and limited fiscal capacity to
improve the absorption of country-specific economic shocks through an insurance system set up at the central
level. !is fiscal capacity aimed to increase the resilience of the eurozone. !e idea was to establish it as a
built-in incentives-based system, so that eurozone Member States eligible for participation in this centralized
asymmetrically working economic shock-absorption function are encouraged to continue implementing
sound fiscal policy and structural reforms, to establish an increasing degree of common decision-making on
national budgets and an enhanced coordination of economic policies.

16.33 SECOND EMU REFORM PLAN (2015–25)

In June 2015 a report entitled _Completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union_ was published and it

- utlined a process to further deepen the EMU; the document is also known as the Five Presidents Report. Its
key objective was to ensure a smoother functioning of the eurozone and that member states in the area are
better prepared to adjust to global challenges. !e completion of the monetary union is set out in three stages.

_Stage 1 (2015–17)_

!is stage involves making the EMU more resilient by building on existing instruments and making the best

possible use of the existing Treaties.

i. **Deepening the Economic Union by ensuring a new boost to convergence, jobs and growth**

**across the entire eurozone.** !is can be achieved by the creation of a eurozone system of National
Competitiveness Authorities; strengthening the macroeconomic imbalance procedure (which aims to
identify countries facing potential crises), a greater focus on employment and social performance and
a stronger coordination of economic policies.

ii. **Completion of the construction of the Banking Union** which involves setting up a bridge financing

mechanism for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF); implementing concrete steps towards the

common backstop to the SRF; agreeing a common European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) and

improving the effectiveness of the instrument for _direct bank recapitalization_ in the European Stability

Mechanism – for more on the Banking Union see sections 16.34 and 16.35.

iii. **(e launch of a new Capital Markets Union (CMU** ) which involves improving access to financing for

all businesses across Europe and investment projects especially for start-ups, small and medium-sized

enterprises (SMEs) and long-term projects. Increasing and diversifying the sources of funding from

investors in both the EU and globally so that companies (including SMEs) in addition to existing bank

credit lending also have the opportunity to access capital markets. Making the capital markets work

more effectively by connecting investors and those who need funding more e'ciently, both within

member states and cross-border. Finally, making the capital markets more shock resilient by pooling

cross-border private risk-sharing through a deepening integration of bond and equity markets.

_Stage 2 (2017–19)_

During this stage the achievements of the first stage were consolidated. !e European Commission issued a

white paper in March 2017 entitled 'Re$ection Paper on the deepening of the economic and monetary union'

which sets out possible ways forward for deepening and completing the Economic and Monetary Union up

434

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

until 2025. !e report notes that the Economic and Monetary Union still falls short on three fronts: (i) it has

not to date been able to reverse su'ciently the social and economic divergences between and within euro area

members that emerged from the global and eurozone crises, (ii) the need to strengthen citizens' support for

the euro and (iii) while the EMU is stronger, it is not yet fully shock-proof.

_Stage 3 (2020–25)_

!is involves reaching the final stage of 'a deep and genuine EMU' including potential EU Treaty changes

including setting up of new institutions. !ere are three components to this final phase:

i. **A Financial Union:** this involves a continuous implementation of the capital markets initiatives; the

roll out of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme; a transition to the issuance of a European Safe

Asset and changes to the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures.

ii. **An Economic and Fiscal Union:** this involves economic and social convergence supported by new

convergence standards and a link with the central stabilization function. !e central stabilization

function would be subject to a decision on design, preparation of implementation and beginning

   - f operations. !e implementation of the new EU multiannual financial framework with a stronger
focus on incentives for reforms. Finally, there would be a simplification of the rules of the Stability
and Growth Pact.

iii. **Democratic Accountability and Effective Governance:** this involves appointing a full

time permanent chair of the Eurogroup which would be established as an o'cial Council

configuration. A)fully unified external representation of the euro area. !e integration of remaining

intergovernmental arrangements in the EU legal framework. !ere would also be new institutions

including the setting-up of a euro area Treasury and a European Monetary Fund to take over around

&500 billion from the European Stability Mechanism. To take over as a 'lender of the last resort'

function to Eurozone member states.

16.34 THE CREATION OF THE BANKING UNION

As the financial crisis of 2008 evolved and eventually turned into the eurozone debt crisis, it became clear that,

for those countries which shared the euro and were ever more interdependent, a deeper integration of the

banking system was needed. Many commentators argue that at the heart of the eurozone crisis was a banking

crisis. French and German banks had accumulated large holdings of PIIGS debt during the period since the

monetary union, attracted by the slightly higher yields on their debt compared to German bunds. In addition,

banks within the PIIGS also accumulated large holdings of their own government's debt as part of their capital

reserves. When the credit crunch came along in 2007 and the economic fundamentals of the PIIGS economies

deteriorated, the banks in the PIIGS found themselves with large losses on their loan books combined

with losses on their holdings of sovereign debt, meaning a bailout of the banking system in countries like

Ireland, Spain and Greece became essential. In addition, as the eurozone crisis led to the questioning of these

countries' participation in EMU, their citizens started to move their deposits from their local banks to what

were perceived to be safer banks in the UK, Switzerland and Germany. !is capital $ight was understandable

as citizens in, for example, Greece feared that their bank accounts would be redenominated in a new drachma

which would then swi(ly fall in value against the euro, implying large losses on their deposits. On 17 April

2012 the Head of the IMF Christine Lagarde argued that:

435

International Finance

to break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks, we need more risk-sharing across borders

in the banking system. In the near term, a pan-euro area facility that has the capacity to take direct

stakes in banks would help. Looking further ahead, monetary union needs to be supported by stronger

financial integration, which our analysis suggests should be in the form of unified supervision, a single

bank resolution authority with a common backstop, and a single deposit insurance fund.

Her call was supported by the Head of the ECB Mario Draghi who on 25 April argued that 'ensuring a wellfunctioning Economic and Monetary Union implies strengthening banking supervision and resolution at the

European level'.

As such, the First Report called for the completion of the Banking Union covering not only the eurozone but

also other EU member states. !e key elements of the Banking Union are a European-level deposit protection

scheme so as to minimize the risk of capital $ight, common capital ratios and a common regulatory regime

including a European-level banking authority with the power and funds necessary to deal with the problem

- f insolvent banks so they could either be recapitalized or shut down in an orderly fashion. !is would give
depositors and the financial markets some degree of confidence in the European banking system and reduce
the risk of contagion and unnecessary bank runs. Getting the Banking Union in place was not an easy task as
each member state sought rules that favoured its banking system. Countries such as Germany demanded that
there be conditions for access to bailout funds due to their concerns about their taxpayers being called on to
bail out Greek and Spanish banks. A deposit guarantee system would require a common funding based on a
percentage of a bank's deposit base. !ere would also be a problem if the banking union incorporated only
the eurozone area, as the EU is committed to a single market in financial services across the Union as a whole.

16.35 THE COMPLETION OF THE EUROPEAN BANKING UNION

!e European Commission mooted the idea of a Banking Union in September 2012 and has therea(er pursued

a number of initiatives aimed at creating a safer and sounder banking sector, especially for those countries

sharing the euro. !e set of initiatives has become known as the creation of a European Banking Union. !e

initiatives involve a single rulebook for all banks in the European Union, stronger prudential requirements for

banks, improved depositor protection and rules for managing failing banks. !e key elements of the Banking

Union are:

1. !e **Single Rulebook** is the foundation of the banking union. It consists of a set of legislative texts

that all financial institutions (including approximately 8,300 banks) in the EU must comply with.

!ese rules cover issues like capital requirements for banks, ensuring better protection for depositors,

and regulation designed to both prevent and manage bank failures.

2. !e **Single Supervisory Mechanism** (SSM) which came into play in November 2014 places the

European Central Bank (ECB) as the central prudential supervisor of financial institutions in the

euro area (including approximately 6,000 banks) and in those non-euro EU countries that choose to

join the SSM. !e ECB directly supervises the largest banks, while the national supervisors continue

to monitor the remaining banks. !e main task of the ECB and the national supervisors, working

closely together within an integrated system, is to check that banks comply with the EU banking rules

and to tackle emerging problems early on.

3. !e **Single Resolution Mechanism** (SRM) entered force in January 2016 and applies to banks

covered by the SSM. In the cases when banks fail, the mechanism allows bank resolution to be

436

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

managed effectively through a Single Resolution Board and a Single Resolution Fund, financed by the

banking sector over an 8-year period based on a levy of 1% of deposits. !e purpose being to ensure

an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimal costs for taxpayers and to the real economy.

4. !e **European Deposit Insurance Scheme** (EDIS) proposed in November 2015 to provide a stronger

and more uniform insurance cover for all retail depositors in the Banking Union. !is would apply

to deposits of up to &100,000 of all banks in the euro area. When a bank is placed into insolvency or

in resolution and it is necessary to pay out depositors or finance their transfer to another bank, the

national deposit guarantee schemes and EDIS will intervene. At the final stage of the EDIS set-up,

the protection of those deposits will be fully financed by EDIS, supported by a close cooperation

between EDIS and member states' national Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS). Given that national

DGS may remain vulnerable to large local shocks, the purpose of EDIS is to ensure equal protection

of deposits through the Banking Union regardless of the member state where the deposit is located.

The transitioning from member states' deposit guarantee schemes (DGS) to the EDIS is planned to take seven years; during the transition both banks and national deposit insurance funds would contribute to the EDIS deposit insurance fund (DIF).

Overall the European Banking Union project is a major change in the regulation of European banking since it involves the harmonization of banking rules. Importantly, it also represents a major centralization of the supervision and regulation of banks with responsibility being shifted in a significant manner to the ECB in conjunction with national authorities. The Single Resolution Mechanism funded by contributions by the banking sector is a major change in that it shifts the responsibility away from taxpayers and national authorities to the more solvent banks. In addition, the EDIS represents a significant cross-country 'mutualization' of protection for depositors which was previously the responsibility of national deposit insurance schemes.

### 16.36 The Creation of a Capital Markets Union

On 19 June 2015 the European Commission was requested by the European Economic and Financial Affairs Council to look into drawing up a roadmap to create a Capital Markets Union (CMU). It has the objective of improving investment and savings flows across the Union to the benefit of businesses and households and to lower the dependence of the eurozone on the banking sector. More specifically, there were four key aims:

1. **Unlock more investment from the EU and the rest of the world** especially for SMEs and to enable

households with better options to finance their retirements.

**Connect financing more effectively to investment projects across the EU: in particular to channel**

**funds** towards smaller states with high growth potential, with more developed market economies
benefiting from greater cross-border investment and saving opportunities.

3. **Increase the stability of the financial system** by opening a wider range of funding sources than just

banks, increasing long-term investment and reducing the vulnerability of EU citizens and companies

to banking shocks.

4. **Deepen financial integration and increased competition** with greater cross-border risk-sharing and

developing deeper and more liquid markets and lowering funding costs for businesses and citizens.

Progress on creating a CMU has been quite discernible by 2021. There have been a range of measures undertaken to make it easier for firms to raise equity and debt finance, to support the venture capital market, improving the securitization market, ensuring the facilitation of greater cross-border investment, facilitating the creation of pan-European pension products, supervision of clearing houses, enabling greater use of over-the-counter derivatives by institutional investors and measures to improve the way crowdfunding platforms operate in the EU.

With the advent of the Covid-19 crisis the EU finance ministers during 2020 and 2021 widened the scope of the CMU project in order to improve corporations' ability to raise finance to help with the economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis and the necessary conversion to a digital and sustainable economy, recognizing that this will require increased funding on the part of EU companies and SMEs, which cannot be shouldered by the banking system alone. The CMU has become an important project for the EU especially in the light of the exit of the UK from the European Union on 1 January 2020 which negatively impacts the ability of London – which is by far Europe's largest financial centre – to service EU corporations and citizens.

### 16.37 The Accession Countries and EMU

When the eight Central Eastern European Countries (CEEC) (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) along with Malta and Cyprus joined the EU in May 2004 they also agreed in principle to the adoption of the euro as their national currency at some time in the future; and none have an 'opt-out' arrangement such as the one negotiated by the UK. The same applies to Romania and Bulgaria who joined in January 2007. According to the European Commission and the ECB, the monetary integration of the new member economies into the euro area should be multilateral (that is, involve the ECB, existing and new entrants), successive (that is, in stages dependent on economic reform and progress prior to ERM II entrance) and phased (some join before others). The new members need to meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria as a precondition for joining EMU, but in addition they are also expected to achieve some real convergence, which entails catching up with the rest of Europe in the process of economic development by speeding up the processes of transition and structural reform.

!e first phase of this process was the pre-accession phase prior to their admittance into the EU in May

2004. During this phase the CEEC adopted the _acquis communautaire_ in respect of EMU – this involved

removal of capital controls, making their central banks independent and prohibiting the central banks from

printing money to finance their fiscal deficits. During the pre-accession phase the CEEC countries were free

to pursue their own independent exchange rate policies.

!e second phase started with their accession and ends with their inclusion in the eurozone. During this

phase the accession states give up some of their monetary autonomy, since their exchange rates are a matter of

common concern, as are their macroeconomic policies (fiscal and monetary). During this period, they need

to avoid excessive $uctuations of their currencies and also misaligned exchange rates (such as undervaluations

which would give them a competitive advantage). Prior to joining EMU they are required to have spent at

least two years with their currencies inside the ERM II arrangement and not to have devalued their currencies

during their membership. When they are assessed to be ready to join EMU they will have no option but to join,

although this is not a major concern since all CEEC countries have already expressed a commitment to do so.

!e third and final phase – the adoption of the euro – starts when the CEEC meet the criteria to join the

eurozone, adopt the euro and cease to use their national currencies. Once they join they have similar rights

and obligations as other eurozone member countries and they will need to respect the fiscal requirements of

the SGP and their national central banks will join in the ESCB arrangements. To date, seven of these countries

(Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Malta, Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania) have joined the eurozone, bringing its

membership to 19. Table 16.11 shows that the remaining potential entrants have lower national debts than

most of the existing eurozone members and need mainly to achieve lower long-term bond yields to meet the

Maastricht Treaty conditions.

!ere are important issues posed by increasing the EMU membership: too early an entry of the weaker

countries into the eurozone could further undermine confidence in the euro and require a looser European

monetary policy than would otherwise be the case. !ere is also no doubt that, with more member states

joining the euro at very different levels of economic development, the design of the optimal monetary policy is

made a more complicated task for the ECB. However, these risks should not be exaggerated: the new member

economies are only a small part of the European Union GDP and there are plenty of safeguards in place to

ensure the euro will remain a low-in$ation currency. Another interesting point is that the post-2007 financial

crisis and Covid-19 crisis have raised the national debts of countries like France and Germany to well above

the 60% national debt entrance criterion of the Maastricht Treaty, so potential new entrants who meet this

condition will be in better fiscal shape than most of the current members of the eurozone.

### 16.38 Conclusions

Although the EMS was originally envisaged as a zone of monetary stability, it differed from a simple agreement to peg exchange rates in a number of important respects, such as the central role of the ECU, the setting-up of a common pool of reserves, the individualization of divergence thresholds and the theoretically symmetric responsibilities for surplus and deficit countries. However, the EMS was certainly far from a monetary union. There was no ECB to supply the ECU, which was a mere calculation and far from a medium of exchange. The EMS transformed itself from a zone of currency stability into a credible anti-inflation zone, and its final transformation was to become a framework for achieving EMU. Its success as an anti-inflation zone can be partly explained by the fact that, following the experience of the 1970s, there was a greater commitment by governments to control inflation. Furthermore, the associated cost in terms of higher unemployment levels did not prove to be politically disastrous for the governments concerned. While EMS members did bring down their inflation rates, especially in the cases of Italy and France, this does not establish causality. It may well have been the case that Italy and France would have engaged in an anti-inflationary set of policies even if they had not joined the EMS.

During the 1980s and 1990s the balance of benefits and costs tipped increasingly favourably towards EMU. In the way of benefits, the single market project, by tackling non-tariff barriers to trade and requiring the removal of capital controls, made the usage of differing national currencies look increasingly inefficient. On the other hand, the main cost associated with EMU, namely the loss of monetary policy sovereignty, had already largely been given up by members of the ERM who accepted the monetary discipline of the Bundesbank. For this reason, France and Italy became increasingly interested in EMU partly because it would give them a greater say in the conduct of monetary policy as members of the board of the ECB.

The PIIGS crisis has shown that, in retrospect, the overlooking of the 60% national debt criterion for entrance to EMU was a mistake. By admitting countries like Italy and Greece, the eurozone made itself vulnerable to a speculative attack on those countries with high national debts. On the other hand, the policy of bailing out bond holders who knew the risks they undertook when buying PIIGS debt must also be questioned. If bondholders fail to diversify their portfolios appropriately, then there is not really a case in a capitalist system for bailing them out. Banks are supposedly sophisticated investors who should understand the need to appropriately diversify their sovereign bond exposures, and the shareholders of those banks should be forced to accept the losses rather than be bailed out by taxpayers of whatever country.

!e survival of the EMU is an issue that extends well beyond the 19 eurozone members. A break-up of

the eurozone would likely cause chaos in the financial markets, and the likely recession that would follow in

the eurozone countries would adversely impact on trading partners such as the UK, the USA, Japan, China

and the rest of the global economy. Despite the PIIGS crisis the euro has survived intact and is backed by a

credible ECB with greater supervision and regulatory powers. !e eurozone is also greatly strengthened by

the emergence of a European Banking Union, a Capital Markets Union and in due course the setting up of

a European Monetary Fund to replace the Single Resolution Mechanism. !e euro itself is likely to remain a

major alternative to the dollar. In 2019 the enlarged eurozone GDP of \$13,335 billion was some way behind

the US GDP of \$21,433 billion, while GDP per capita in the USA was \$65,298 which is significantly higher

than the eurozone average of \$38,985. In 2019 the eurozone area accounted for 15.2% of world output, lower

than the 24.5% share of the United States. However, in 2018 the eurozone export total (excluding intra-EU

trade) was 15.7% of global GDP while the USA export total was 11.7% of global GDP. Against this, US capital

markets are around twice the size of the combined EU markets, and the dollar dominance may take some

time to be overcome. Some authors such as Cohen (2003) are sceptical about whether the euro will challenge

the dollar as the major international currency in the foreseeable future. However, a shi( towards the euro as

a reserve currency up from 18.3% of foreign currency reserves in 2000 to 20.7% in 2018 and lower holdings

- f dollar reserves down from 71.1% in 2000 to 61.7% in 2018 has occurred over time as countries like China,
Korea, India and Russia have diversified their risks from US Treasury bonds, regardless of the merits or

- otherwise of the euro.

The euro crisis revealed some significant flaws in the design of the EMU project that were not fully appreciated when it was launched in 1999. The first flaw was that the criteria for admission to EMU were not fully adhered to. In particular, the 60% ceiling on the national debt criterion was ignored. This meant that countries like Italy and Greece were admitted with national debts over 100% of GDP, well above the Maastricht limit. While the SGP was designed to ensure fiscal rectitude following EMU, it was not fully appreciated what the impact of a major recession would do to fiscal balances and national debt dynamics. The 2008–12 recession revealed that several countries' debt dynamics were unsustainable in the face of a significant adverse economic shock. The other key flaw in the system was the limited role for the ECB as a lender of last resort: its SMP purchases of government bonds, liquidity provision and LTRO policies were controversial and seen by some German policy-makers as contrary to the no-bailout principle. If the ECB had a lender of the last resort function it might have been able to forestall the crisis by making it clear to market participants that their sovereign bond holdings in the PIIGS would be repaid in full. This would have helped to keep down their borrowing rates and reduced the risk of contagion.

The euro survived the PIIGS crisis intact and the European Central Bank has shown a strong commitment to maintain the integrity of the eurozone area with its willingness to undertake a series of quantitative easing measures. There was a period during the eurozone crisis when Greece was on the verge of leaving the eurozone and/or defaulting on its debt. However, the support of the German government, the ECB being prepared to 'do whatever it takes' and subsequent restructuring of Greek debt have enabled the eurozone to increase rather than decrease its membership.

Even though the eurozone survived the PIIGS crisis, the recent large increases in fiscal deficits and national debts and falls in the eurozone GDP resulting from the Covid-19 crisis of 2020–21 will present new challenges for many of the eurozone countries. The Covid-19 crisis means that there remains a continued need for certain countries to bring down their fiscal deficits and national debts to much more manageable and sustainable levels, along with continued progress on restoring the competitiveness of their economies. It also involves undertaking what in the short term are painful structural reforms designed to improve the workings of goods and labour markets. In addition, there remains a need for banks to reduce their sovereign exposures and continue the process of deleveraging and restoring their balance sheets to a healthier state. Such reforms will take many years to implement, will usually meet stiff resistance and, even when in place, will take time to bear fruit.

Following the eurozone crisis, it became clear that a successful European Monetary Union required progress to be made not only on fiscal deficits but also a stronger institutional framework in the form of progress towards a Banking Union and Capital Markets Union. In this respect, once fully implemented the Banking and Capital Market Unions will be a significant step in the right direction towards providing a much stronger framework for the EMU project. Some go further and suggest that it even requires some form of political union if it is ultimately to survive and prosper. On balance, the chances are that the eurozone will remain intact and is unlikely to lose any of its members for the foreseeable future. Indeed, it is likely to continue to gradually increase in size; this is due to a number of factors. The EMU project is in many ways a political rather than economic project and, given the enormous political capital that was expended in setting up the project in the first instance, one should not underestimate the political will present to keep the project alive. Ultimately, it is political will that will decide the fate of the euro. A country leaving the euro would also raise the prospects of severe economic contagion as speculators attacked the next candidate country likely to leave. There would also be bank runs in countries where it was felt that exit from the euro was a significant probability, leading to the need for such banks to be rescued. From a legal standpoint, there is currently no provision for a country to leave the eurozone and there would be huge problems in both financial markets and the real economy concerning the validity and valuation of outstanding contracts. As such, the costs of countries leaving are substantially higher than the costs of staying in the eurozone, for both the country concerned and other key countries such as France and Germany.
