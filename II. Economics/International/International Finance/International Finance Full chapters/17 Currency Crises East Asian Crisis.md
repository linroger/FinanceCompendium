17.1 INTRODUCTION

!e 1990s and early part of this century were characterized by a number of currency and financial crises.

!e turmoil started with major speculative attacks against the EMS in 1992–93 which led to devaluations

- f the pound sterling and the Italian lira, followed by the Mexican crisis of December 1994. !en, starting
with the !ai baht devaluation on 2 July 1997, the so-called East Asian financial crisis is generally agreed to
have started. !e Asian crisis was characterized by major economic and financial turmoil in many of the East
Asian economies with large falls in the values of their currencies, stock markets and property prices. !e crisis
continued into 1998, a year in which there were very significant falls in output in many of these previously
fast-growing economies. Fortunately, there was a sharp recovery of those economies in 1999 and 2000 by
which time the crisis was largely over.

!e Asian financial crisis was swi(ly followed by other crises such as the Russian default on its debt in

August 1998 and the collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in late September 1998.

Other noticeable crises followed: in January 1999 the Brazilian real was forced to devalue and eventually to

$oat, quickly depreciating a further 35%; in January 2001 there was a major banking crisis in Turkey, leading

to the $oating of the Turkish lira; and, more spectacularly, in December 2001 Argentina declared a default on

its external debt and abandoned its currency board on 7 January 2002 with a devaluation from 1 to 1.4 pesos

per dollar, swi(ly followed by a dramatic fall to a low of 3.75 pesos per dollar by the end of October 2002.

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

!ese periodic crises have stimulated a great deal of theoretical and empirical literature that looks at the

causes of currency and financial crises, and in this chapter we look at some of the theoretical models that have

been developed to analyse such crises. In particular, we will look at what have been termed first-, secondand

third-generation models of currency crises, and we will explain some of their basic features and differences.

We will also brie$y mention some of the other models that have been developed. We then concentrate on

the causes and details surrounding the East Asian financial crisis, which was one of the most significant

events to confront the international financial community in the last 40 years. We focus attention on eight

- f the countries most directly involved in the crisis, namely Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, South
Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and !ailand, and as such we will exclude any detailed analysis of other
countries affected by the crisis such as China and India. A great deal of money can be made by predicting
crises in advance of them happening, and early warning of such crises may help policy-makers to avert them.
We conclude the chapter by looking at some of the recent literature that attempts to find what economic and
financial indicators may be useful to predict currency and financial crises.

17.2 FIRST-GENERATION MODELS OF CURRENCY CRISES

First-generation models refer to a strand of literature that builds upon an article by Krugman (1979) and

which has been extended and developed in various directions; see for example Flood and Garber (1984).

In his article, Krugman assumed that a government operates a fixed exchange rate and runs a budget deficit

financed by the government selling bonds in exchange for money from the central bank; that is, its fiscal

deficits are financed)by domestic credit expansion. However, this increases the supply of money and puts

downward pressure on the interest rate leading to capital out$ows and pressure for a devaluation of the

currency. As such, it is necessary for the central bank to defend the currency by using its foreign exchange

reserves. At)a certain point, the reserves reach a critically low level and a speculative attack is made on the

currency, forcing a devaluation. In the so-called 'first generation models of speculative currency attacks'

there) is a fundamental inconsistency between the fiscal (and with it monetary) policy pursued by the

government and)the commitment to a fixed exchange rate, which is spotted by speculators and precipitates a

speculative attack.

!e assumptions of the Krugman (1979) model are: perfect competition in the economy; domestic and

foreign goods are perfect substitutes; perfect capital mobility and uncovered interest parity (UIP) holds at all

times; and purchasing power parity holds. In the Krugman model, money demand is assumed to be fixed at

some constant value and the exchange rate is assumed to be fixed so that _s_ _[. ]_ = 0, where _s_ _[.]_ is the rate of change

- f the exchange rate. A final important feature of the model is that once the fixed exchange rate regime breaks
down, the new regime that replaces it is a fully $oating one.

!e first assumption is that the money market is kept in continual equilibrium, that is:

_mdt_ = _[—]_ _mst_ (17.1)

where _mdt_ is the log of money demand, and _[—]_ _mst_ is the log of the fixed money supply.

!e demand for real money balance is assumed to be inversely related to the domestic interest rate:

_mdt_                  - _p_ =���� _r_ (17.2)

where _p_ is the log of the domestic price level and _r_ is the domestic interest rate.

443

International Finance

!e log of the money supply is given by a log linearization of the domestic credit and foreign exchange

reserves:

_—_

_mst_ =� _D_                     - � _R_ (17.3)

where _D_ is the log of domestic credit and _R_ is the log of the reserve component of the monetary base. (Note

equation (17.3) is strictly true only in _levels_ but is an acceptable log-linearization approximation in the

literature.)

!e domestic credit is assumed to expand at a constant rate per annum _D_ _[˙]_ = . where _D_ _[˙]_ is the rate of change

- f domestic credit. !e increase in domestic credit is assumed to come about because of the government
printing money to buy domestic bonds that are being sold to finance its fiscal deficit.

!e exchange rate is assumed to follow PPP so that:

_s_ = _p_                           - _p_                           - (17.4)

where _s_ is the log of the exchange rate defined as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, _p_ is the

log of the domestic price level and _p_ - is the log of the foreign price level.

UIP is assumed to hold at all times so:

_r_ = _r_                         -                         - _Es_ / (17.5)

where _r_ is the domestic interest rate, _r_ - is the foreign interest rate and _Es_ / is the expected rate of depreciation

- f the domestic currency.

Since money demand is a constant, any increase in domestic credit will, as in the monetary model, lead to a

fall in reserves of an equivalent amount, which implies that the rate of fall of reserves _R˙_ is the same as the rate

- f increase of domestic credit; that is:

_R˙_ =                              - . (17.6)

Finally, assuming the exchange rate is fixed at _s¯_ and _Es_ / = 0, the foreign interest rate at _r_  - = _r_ and the foreign

price level is fixed at _p_ *, we can substitute equations (17.1) to (17.3) and (17.5) into equation (17.4) to obtain:

_s¯_ = R                                           - D                                           - � p*                                           - +r* (17.7)

Since we assume that _p_ - and _r_ - are fixed, increases in domestic credit lead to equivalent falls in foreign

exchange reserves and there is no change in the money supply. It is quite clear that if foreign exchange reserves

are falling at the same rate that domestic credit is expanding, at some point they will reach a critically low

level. It is not a foregone conclusion that a speculative attack will necessarily follow a decline in the reserves;

however, if the central bank announces that once reserves hit a certain level they will abandon the fixed

exchange rate then a speculative attack is a foregone conclusion. !e interesting thing is that speculators will

not wait until the reserves reach the critically low level before mounting the speculative attack since this would

imply a large capital loss at that point. Rational speculators will launch the speculative attack before the critical

level of reserves is met. Flood and Garber (1984) have shown that the speculative attack will occur when the

rate of exchange that would occur if the currency were $oating (the so-called shadow exchange rate) is equal

to the fixed exchange rate and that the speculative attack will completely drain the foreign exchange reserves

- f the central bank. !e dynamics of the speculative attack are illustrated in Figure 17.1.

In Figure 17.1(a) it can be seen that the money supply is fixed at the level _M_ 1 at time _t_ 1, domestic credit

is expanding at a rate _D_ _[˙]_ = . and the reserves are falling by a like amount at the rate _R˙_ = - . with the money

supply remaining constant. !e shadow exchange rate in Figure 17.1(b) starts at an overvalued level _S_ 1 but

would, if the exchange rate were $oating, depreciate at a rate _s_ / = . in line with the rate of increase of domestic

credit. While the fixed exchange rate of the peso per dollar is undervalued at, say, 2 pesos per dollar compared

to the shadow exchange rate, say 1.5 pesos per dollar, it is possible to maintain a fixed exchange rate without

any problems since there is no prospect of a capital gain for speculators. However, once the shadow exchange

rate moves above the fixed exchange rate making the latter overvalued at time _T_, for example 2.01 pesos per

dollar, a speculative attack is inevitable as it pays speculators to sell unlimited quantities of domestic currency

(pesos) to buy the foreign currency (dollars) – the authorities’ foreign exchange reserves will be exhausted

and the currency is forced to $oat. It should be noted that at the precise time of the speculative attack there is

an increase in the domestic interest rate to compensate investors for the fact that a(er the speculative attack

the exchange rate is expected to depreciate at the rate µ, in line with the expansion of domestic credit – this

follows from the UIP condition. !e timing of the attack is such that there is no discrete jump in the exchange

rate, as this would imply large capital losses for speculators at that point; but since the inevitable breakdown

- f the fixed parity is foreseen in advance this would be inconsistent with an e'cient market and therefore can
be ruled out.

At the time of the speculative attack the reserves are exhausted and fall by an amount d _R_ (negative), hence,

there is a discrete fall in the money supply of a like amount d _ms_ (negative). !ere is also a rise in the domestic

interest rate given by µ (since this is the rate at which the currency is expected to depreciate in line with the

growth of domestic credit), so that _r_ becomes _r_ - µ. Inserting this into the money demand equation (17.2)

means there is a fall in money demand given by d _md_ =�� +µ. Since the money market is kept in continual

equilibrium the fall in the money supply equals the fall in money demand, so that:

d _R_ =����� (17.8)

445

International Finance

Since before the speculative attack reserves were falling at the rate µ, if the initial stock of reserves is given by

_R_ 1 and the time from the base period to the attack is given by _T_, then the level of reserves just prior to the

attack must be _R_ 1 - µ _T_ (positive) which must be equal to the fall in reserves that occurs at the time of the

attack - d _R_ (positive since d _R_ is negative). !at is:

_R_ 1                 - µ _T_ =�� d _R_ (17.9)

Substituting (17.8) into (17.9) and rearranging to solve for the timing of the speculative attack _T_, we find:

_R_ 1 σµ

_T_

µ

(17.10)

!at is, the timing of the speculative attack is greater (that is, delayed) the higher the initial level of reserves

_R_ 1 and the lower the rate of expansion of domestic credit µ. !is condition makes sound intuitive economic

sense: the higher the level of reserves, the greater the ability of the authorities to resist a speculative attack; and

the lower the rate of domestic credit expansion of domestic credit, the slower the drain on the reserves from

domestic credit expansion.

!ere have been several criticisms of the first-generation models, including the following:

1. It is unclear why the level of foreign exchange reserves should be so crucial to the timing of a

speculative attack, since governments could always resist an attack on their currencies by other

means such as raising the domestic interest rate. If they raise interest rates su'ciently this will lead to

potential losses for speculators that have borrowed large amounts of the domestic currency so as to

sell it in the foreign exchange market.

It is not at all clear why a government that is committed to a fixed exchange rate regime would wish

to pursue a policy of printing money to finance its fiscal deficit that it knows will ultimately lead to

a speculative attack on its currency. In the real world, it is likely that governments are far smarter

than assumed in the first-generation models and will look at the costs and benefits of maintaining a

fixed exchange rate system as well as keeping the option of allowing their currency to $oat prior to a

speculative attack.

3. !ere was also an empirical problem in that some of the post-1980s crises were not characterized by

large fiscal deficits that had been monetarized as assumed in the first-generation models. !ere had

been no secular change in the fundamentals prior to the ERM crises in 1992–93 as predicted by these

models, and the ERM crises were largely unforeseen. In addition, as we shall see, most of the Asian

economies were running fiscal surpluses prior to the outbreak of their crises.

4. A further empirical problem is that in some of the recent crises there was not a secular fall in the

foreign exchange reserves as predicted by the first-generation models. In the Asian economies heavy

capital in$ows in the years prior to the outbreak of the crises had meant that foreign exchange

reserves had been increasing as central banks sold their currencies to buy US dollars to offset the

excess demand for their currencies from capital in$ows. As we shall see, it was in fact an abrupt

change from capital in$ows to capital out$ows that led to the currency and financial crises in these

economies.

17.3 SECOND-GENERATION MODELS OF CURRENCY CRISES

Due to the deficiencies of the first-generation models in explaining currency crises, in particular the

speculative attack on the ERM that occurred in 1992–93, a new generation of models emerged in the 1990s

(see, for example, Obstfeld, 1994, 1996; Jeanne, 1997, who offers an alternative explanation of currency crises).

Two key features of the second-generation models are that governments are assumed to be much smarter

than in the first-generation models; that is, they continually evaluate the pros and cons of maintaining a

fixed exchange rate, and the linkage between macro-fundamentals and the timing of speculative attacks is

much weaker than in the first-generation models. In fact some authors such as Rangvid (2001) contend that

the key distinction between firstand second-generation models is that in the latter the government seeks to

minimize some sort of loss function, for instance deviations of output or in$ation rates from their desired

levels. In the second-generation models, a devaluation is seen as an optimal response by the government to

speculative pressures against the currency. !e second-generation models allow for the possibility that the

private sector anticipating a devaluation can increase the costs to the devaluing government of not devaluing

such that it becomes rational for the government to devalue. In such models, there is the possibility of _multiple_

_equilibria_ ; that is, if private agents' expectations of devaluation are low then the costs of maintaining a fixed

exchange rate are low and hence the government of the country will not devalue. On the other hand, if private

agents' expectations of devaluation are high then the costs of maintaining a fixed exchange rate are high and

the government accordingly has a higher incentive to devalue. In such models, private agents' expectations

can become self-fulfilling in the sense that if there is an exogenous shock to their expectations, such that they

move from a low to a high risk of devaluation, then the probability of a devaluation will rise accordingly. !ere

are usually three key components to the second-generation models:

Government preferences: the costs and benefits to the authorities of maintaining a fixed exchange

rate are continually reviewed and modelled. !e authorities are assumed to attach some weight

to exchange rate stability and some weight to a real variable such as output stability or the rate of

unemployment. For example a possible loss function is:

_L_ = ( _y_ t                       - _y_ *) [2]                       - � _w_ ( _s_ t                       - 1                       - _s_ t) [2]

where _y_ t is the log of current level of output, _y_    - is the log of desired level of output, _s_ t+1 is the log of

exchange rate one period hence, _s_ t is the log of exchange rate today, and _w_ is a weighting parameter.

Here the idea is that the government attaches some importance to stability of output and

some importance to stability of the exchange rate. A link between changes in the exchange rate

and deviations of output can then be introduced. For instance, a sudden increase in expectations

    - f a devaluation might lead to higher wage demands (since the price level will rise following a

devaluation) and a rise in real wages in the short term, which leads to a fall in output below the

desired level.

Specification of the real variable: different second-generation models specify different real

variables that are affected by an expected devaluation; this may be the level of output, the level of

unemployment or the real level of public debt. An expected devaluation will likely lead to a fall in

    - utput (due to wage rises in anticipation of devaluation) or a rise in unemployment (for example, by

raising interest rates to compensate for the risk of a devaluation) or the cost of servicing the public

debt (since an expected devaluation will raise the required interest rate).

447

International Finance

!ere is a fixed cost to devaluation: the second-generation models assume that if a government is

forced to devalue then there will be a given cost to it, and this cost might be seen as a loss of political

prestige due to a failure to carry out the stated fixed exchange rate policy or a loss of economic

credibility.

In second-generation models, some sort of shock comes along to alter private agents' expectations of a

devaluation. If the shock is small then the costs of maintaining the fixed exchange rate will be relatively small

and it is likely that the authorities will be able to continue with the fixed exchange rate regime. If, however, the

shock is relatively large and private agents' expectations of the size of a potential devaluation become quite

large, this increases the cost to the government of maintaining the fixed exchange rate; for example the loss

- f output will rise, making it more likely that the government will decide to abandon the fixed exchange rate.
One of the key features of second-generation models is the more the expectation of a devaluation, the more
the cost to the government of maintaining the fixed exchange rate and the higher the actual devaluation that
is required. For instance, if agents expect a high rate of devaluation they will then put in high wage demands
which leads to a high loss of output; hence, it will pay the government to enact a large devaluation to ensure
that realized prices rise by a large amount and that real wages remain constant, so minimizing the loss of

- output that occurs. !e subsequent switch to $oating will also permit the authorities to engage in a monetary
expansion to cure high levels of unemployment.

Another key feature of second-generation models is that there can be sudden switches in private agents'

expectations concerning a devaluation without any apparent change in the economic fundamentals. An

economy with sound fundamentals and low expectations of a devaluation can suddenly be exposed to

a speculative attack and a high probability of devaluation simply because of a sudden change in private

agents' expectations of a devaluation without any significant change in macro-fundamentals. It is, however,

important to note that an increase in private agents' expectations of a devaluation will not necessarily lead

to an actual devaluation in the second-generation models. !e government is continually monitoring the

costs and benefits of the devaluation and if, for instance, the fixed costs of devaluation are relatively high then

the government may decide it is best not to devalue, whereas if the fixed costs of devaluation are relatively

low the government might decide to devalue. Nonetheless, the probability of a devaluation in the secondgeneration models is affected by the state of the fundamentals. If the fundamentals are very bad (for example,

unemployment is very high) then a devaluation is more likely than when the fundamentals are good (for

example, unemployment is low), since private agents' rational expectations of the government adopting a

devaluation increase when unemployment is high rather than when it is low.

While the second-generation models have provided some new insights and in particular assume much

smarter governments than in first-generation models, there remain several problems which they do not

satisfactorily deal with. In particular, the reason why private agents should switch expectations from a low

state of probability of devaluation to a high probability is not clear. In addition, the precise state of financial

markets prior to the outbreak of the crisis is not fully considered in the second-generation models.

17.4 THIRD-GENERATION AND OTHER MODELS OF CURRENCY AND FINANCIAL CRISES

In addition to the firstand second-generation models, in an attempt to explain properly the Asian financial

crises, so-called third-generation models of currency crises have been developed. Indeed, there has been

an extensive range of other models designed to explain financial and currency crises. !e third-generation

models were developed because it was noted that there had not been severe fiscal problems in the Asian

448

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

economies prior to the outbreak of the crises as one might have expected from the first-generation models.

In addition, there were also no significant monetary expansions a(er the crisis as might have been expected

from the second-generation models. !e third-generation models vary greatly in their assumptions, but they

have a common theme that financial crises (rather than currency crises _per se_ ) can be caused by a 'moral

hazard' problem. Such a problem exists when the existence of an insurance policy makes the insured-against

event)more likely to occur than if no such insurance policy existed (see Box 17.1 for a simple example of

moral)hazard).

Models such as Akerlof and Romer (1994), Burnside et al. (2001), Corsetti et al. (1999), Dooley (2000),

Edison et al. (1999), Krugman (1998a, 1998b) and McKinnon and Pill (1996) argue that a crucial role in

the occurrence of a financial/currency crisis is played when private agents perceive financial intermediaries'

liabilities as having an implicit government guarantee. !is enables the financial intermediaries in the country

to borrow money at relatively low rates of interest and then lend it out in highly risky investments, leading

for example to property and stock market bubbles and even outright fraud. When things go wrong agents

know/assume that the government will come along to bail out the affected banks. Krugman (1998a) has

characterized this mentality as 'to play a game of heads I win, tails the taxpayer loses'. As asset prices rise, the

lending looks to be sound but eventually the asset bubbles burst and a vicious circle comes into play as the

proportion of non-performing loans rises and asset prices decline. Once the bubble appears to be bursting,

it can also trigger a large capital out$ow from the country and a collapse of the exchange rate of the country

involved.

In addition to the models discussed, there have been numerous others designed to explain why financial

crises occur. Blanchard and Watson (1982) emphasize the importance of 'rational' financial bubbles, where

economic agents continue to buy what are perceived to be overvalued financial assets (or even real assets

such as property) in the belief that the prospective capital gain from a continuation of the upward trend will

more than compensate for the risk of a sudden collapse. Of course, an eventual collapse does occur resulting

**Box 17.1 Moral hazard and how a government bailout guarantee can turn a**
**bad investment into a good one**

!e third-generation financial-crisis models focus attention on the problem of 'moral hazard', whereby

explicit or even perceived government guarantees to bail out investors can make the probability of such

bailouts more likely to occur than if no such explicit/implicit guarantees existed. Consider the following

simple numerical example. An investment project requires \$80 million and will generate a profit of \$40

million with a probability of 40%, and a loss of \$40 million with a probability of 60%. !e expected

return from the project is therefore negative, since (\$40 million  - 0.4) + (–\$40 million * 0.6) = –\$8

million. Clearly this investment does not make economic sense and will not therefore be undertaken

and will not require any government rescue package. Imagine, however, that a government keen to see

the investment go ahead guarantees investors that if the project does not work they will be bailed out by

the taxpayer so as not to make any losses on their investment. In this case, the expected return on the

project becomes positive since (\$40 million * 0.4) + (\$0 million * 0.6) = +\$16 million, or a 20% return

  - n the \$80 million investment. Assume now that the expected rate of return is su'ciently high that the
investment takes place. !ere is now a 60% chance that taxpayers will end up having to stump up \$40
million if the project goes wrong. !e existence of the bailout package makes a bailout more probable
(60%) than if no such bailout promise existed (0%) – this is the essence of the problem of moral hazard.

in large capital losses for those caught out near the top of the bubble. Other models such as Radlett and Sachs

(1998) emphasize the role of financial panic which usually happens out of the blue; an important element of

such models is that otherwise-solvent borrowers face a liquidity squeeze when short-term liabilities exceed

their short-term assets. Another model is that of Sachs (1995) who discusses the role of disorderly workouts

in financial crises. A disorderly workout occurs when there is a lack of coordination between creditors who

decide individually to withdraw funds from the distressed borrower. !e lack of coordination between

borrowers may be based on the fact that local bankruptcy laws are absent or ineffective. Another model worthy

- f mention, where current account deficits financed by capital in$ows can provoke a crisis, is that of Rigobon
(1998) where excessive optimism leads to massive capital in$ows that are suddenly and abruptly reversed
when a shock hits the system. In Rigobon's model, economic growth, to the extent that it fuels unrealistic
expectations about long-run economic growth prospects, can be accompanied by overinvestment, excessive
reliance on foreign capital and insu'cient monitoring of domestic investments.

Other models emphasize the role of contagion behaviour on the part of investors. Fratzcher's (2003) paper

is interesting in this respect. Defining contagion as 'the transmission of a crisis to a particular country due to

its real and financial interdependence with countries that are already experiencing a crisis' (p. 110), Fratzcher

argues that contagion provides an adequate description of both the Asian crisis of 1997/98 and the Latin

American crisis of 1994. In the paper, it is the proximity of a country to another country under speculative

attack that triggers the contagion. Various forms of _financial interdependence_ can exist, such as cross-border

holdings between banks and financial institutions within a region, or a common creditor to banks in a

region)– and should the common creditor withdraw from the region then all the countries in the region will

be affected. In addition, _real interdependence_ can exist via bilateral trade $ows or trade competition between

countries so that a crisis in one country might lead to a fall in exports of another or a devaluation of one

currency necessitates a devaluation of another currency to maintain its competitive position. Fratzcher finds

that the degree of trade linkages and competition in the Asian region was high, as was the degree of financial

integration (for example, as measured by correlations of their stock markets and competition between banks).

Fratzcher also finds that the degree of interdependence is very much related to the regional proximity of

countries to one another. For instance, the Asian economies have much higher degrees of financial and real

linkages between each other than with Latin America, and likewise Latin American economies have much

higher degrees of financial and real linkages between themselves than with Asia. Fratzcher finds that the main

linkage through which contagion is likely to have spread is the financial linkage, which is significant in most

cases, whereas the real linkages, while important, are generally speaking less significant. In particular, the

study shows that bank contagion, the withdrawal of funds and refusal of banks to roll over their loans to the

region may have been very significant explanations of the crisis.

Baig and Goldfajn (1999) examine stock markets, foreign exchanges, interest rates and sovereign spreads

using high-frequency data and find that correlations between the East Asian economies increased during the

crisis as did their sensitivity to both good and bad news in the other economies, all of which supports the

idea)of contagion being significant in the crisis. A paper by Caramazza et al. (2004) finds a significant role

played by financial contagion in the Mexican, Asian and Russian crises, particularly through the common

creditor route.

Some theories use herd behaviour as an explanation of currency and financial crises. For example, Calvo

(1996) and Calvo and Mendoza (2000) argue that emerging markets are particularly susceptible to a herd

mentality on the part of investors. Investors find it costly and potentially risky to examine the state of each

economy when there are signs of problems, and so it becomes optimal for them to pull out of a group of

related markets simultaneously when they spot signs of nervousness in just one of them. Likewise, Masson

(1998) argues that investor psychology can play a role – a small trigger can lead to investors collectively losing

450

confidence and collectively perceiving a higher risk of holding an investment in a set of countries. !is then

leads investors to follow each other and simultaneously pull their funds out of a region, causing financial

and economic distress to the region. !e foregoing overview of the literature is deliberately selective but

nonetheless provides us with a useful toolkit with which to study the East Asian financial crisis.

17.5 THE RUN-UP TO THE ASIAN CRISIS

One of the most fascinating things about the Asian financial meltdown is that it was largely unforeseen, and

there is plenty of anecdotal evidence for this. !e IMF in its _World Economic Outlook_ publication of April

1997 predicted strong, albeit marginally slower, economic growth of over 5% for Asia in 1998 (excluding India

and Japan). !ere were some expressions of concern about Indonesia but no real alarm bells seemed to have

been ringing at the IMF. Also it seems that international investors remained confident as net capital $ows

continued into the region right up until the crisis broke; only in !ailand and Korea did capital $ows begin to

dry up somewhat earlier in 1996. In addition, Cline and Barnes (1997) show the spread between Asian dollardenominated debt and that on US Treasury bonds was actually falling between mid-1995 and mid-1997,

contrary to what one would expect if market participants were expecting a crisis. Furthermore, Standard &

Poor's and Moody's sovereign credit ratings remained largely unchanged in the year preceding the outbreak

- f the crisis and the eventual downgrades happened only three to five months a(er the crisis had broken out!
In addition, many stock markets in the region were reaching new peaks as late as July 1997, which indicates
that market participants were not forecasting the likely extent of the fall of the markets that subsequently

- occurred. Finally, currency forecasts by investment banks in the region did not predict any significant moves
in exchange rates.

17.6 THE MACROECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS

!e fact that the crisis was largely unforeseen is consistent with the hypothesis that the economic fundamentals,

while deteriorating in the run-up to the crisis, were not of a significant enough measure to justify the crisis.

To advance this hypothesis a bit further we need to look at the economic performance of the economies in the

run-up to the crisis. Firstly, we look at the economic growth rates, secondly their in$ation rates, and finally

we examine their current account positions. We then proceed to look at what is regarded as the key to the

crisis, which was the excessive lending to the region which fuelled asset bubbles (see, for example, Sarno and

Taylor (1999) who detect asset bubbles in all the affected economies, the inevitable bursting of which then led

to a large degree of panic on the part of foreign banks and investors who decided _en masse_ to pull funds out

- f the region). Once the property and stock market bubbles burst, there was a significant deterioration in the
quality of the asset side of banks' balance sheets in the region, as witnessed by a significant increase in their
non-performing loans.

Table 17.1 shows that economic growth rates in the Asian economies were extremely high in the run-up

to the crisis, with real growth rates in the region of 6–9%; only the Philippines was suffering from low growth

in the early 1990s, though from 1996 even it was growing at over 5%. High rates of economic growth are

generally speaking a good thing unless they are fuelled by excessive debt and/or deterioration in the external

accounts of a country. It is quite possible that the prolonged period of economic prosperity sowed the seeds of

its own destruction in that it led economic agents to have unduly optimistic expectations for the future. In the

case of Asia this may well have been the case; terms like the 'Asian miracle' had become part of the domestic

and international perception of Asia. With respect to the stock markets and the property sector the high rates

- f economic growth may have led to unwarranted extrapolative expectations and to some extent prices were
driven up by expectations of further price rises rather than a more realistic appraisal of the relevant economic
fundamentals.

_Inflation rates_

!e in$ation rate can play a significant part in economic crises, especially if the exchange rate is fixed, since

higher domestic in$ation relative to foreign in$ation can cause an appreciation of the real exchange rate and

the in$ation rate itself can be taken as a sign of economic mismanagement. However, there is relatively little

evidence (see Table 17.2) that in$ation was a significant factor in the run-up to the crisis. Given the strong

economic growth in the region, in$ation was surprisingly benign, although there may well have been some

masking of the underlying in$ation due to the existence of price controls in Malaysia and Indonesia.

!e in$ation rate is more likely to lead to real exchange rate appreciation, so undermining the competitiveness

- f countries when a country has a fixed exchange rate. In Asia the exchange rate policies varied in their
degree of fixity with regard to the US dollar. !ailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and the Philippines had more or
less fixed parities, while Korea and !ailand had less rigid, crawling peg systems whereby the exchange rate
was adjusted on occasion to maintain external competitiveness. Indonesia had a policy of targeting the real
exchange rate allowing its currency to depreciate to the extent that its in$ation rate was higher than that of its
trading partners.

Table 17.3 shows the value of the real exchange rate in the countries in the run-up to the crisis. What is

clear is that four of the currencies – the Hong Kong dollar, the Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and

the Philippines dollar – all appreciated in real terms prior to the crisis, and as such might have been vulnerable

to a speculative attack. However, the picture is not uniform since four of the currencies had depreciated in real

terms, so there is little evidence that real exchange rate appreciation played any significant role in the crisis

by providing speculators with the prospect of a discrete fall in some of the Asian currencies. It seems that by

1997 only Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore were potentially vulnerable, while real exchange rates

in the other six countries were not significantly different from those in 1991 or had depreciated in real terms.

_The current account_

!e role of current account imbalances in provoking financial crises appears in numerous models such as

Dornbusch et al. (1995), Mishkin (1996), Roubini and Wachtel (1998) and Sachs et al. (1996). Lawrence

Summers presciently noted in _Te Economist_ (23 December 1996) that 'close attention should be paid to any

current account deficit in excess of 5% of GDP, particularly if it is financed in a way that could lead to rapid

reversals'. It is noticeable that a number of Asian economies were becoming more vulnerable in this regard, as

shown in Table 17.4.

!e table shows that many of the countries were experiencing large or deteriorating current account deficits

as a percentage of their GDP in the 1990s and in the run-up to the crisis in 1997. !is was especially the case for

!ailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Korea. In the case of !ailand it was running at an unsustainable rate

- f over 8% of GDP a year in 1995 and 6.7% in 1996. In the case of Hong Kong large surpluses were being run
up until 1994 but therea(er there was a significant deterioration. Nonetheless, the picture is far from uniform;
for example, Singapore had large surpluses which actually steadily increased in the 1990s, and likewise Taiwan
also remained in surplus throughout the 1990s. To some extent, given the high economic growth rates, some

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

weakness in the current account was to be expected. Interestingly, what may have been more significant as an

early-warning signal was that the deterioration in the current accounts in the immediate run-up to the crisis

from 1994 to 1996 coincided with a slowdown in economic growth rates over that period (with the notable

exception of Malaysia). As we shall see later, there was some weak linkage between the size of the current

account deficit and the fall in the nominal exchange rate that subsequently occurred.

Economics makes a distinction between current account deficits that on the one hand are due to domestic

investment being greater than domestic savings and on the other hand are due to government expenditures

exceeding government tax revenues. Generally speaking, where a current account deficit is caused by high

domestic investment then it is usually regarded as less worrying than in the case where it is caused by

low savings, which is suggestive of a consumption boom. One has to be careful, however, because even if

investment is higher than domestic savings, this investment needs to be productive. Also it needs to give a

su'cient boost to the traded sector to improve the future current account performance of the economy. To

the extent that the investment is directed to the non-traded sector, for example the property sector, then it may

not help to improve the current account in the longer run. It is instructive to look at the government finances

and the private-sector balances in this regard; Table 17.5 shows the government fiscal balances as a percentage

- f GDP and Table 17.6 shows the excess of private investment over private savings as a percentage of GDP.

From Table 17.5 it becomes apparent that it is very di'cult to argue that the cause of the crisis lay in the

pursuit of imprudent fiscal policies. Most governments were running fiscal surpluses and only in Taiwan was

the size of the fiscal deficit significant, and even then it was actually being reduced in the run-up to the crisis.

Hence, _prima facie_, the evidence suggests that there was not a significant fiscal root to the crisis. However, one

has to be careful; in an in$uential paper, Burnside et al. (2001) argue that the size of fiscal deficits/surpluses

masked the potential dangers to public debt levels of implicit bailout guarantees.

What is more apparent from Table 17.6 is that in many of the economies there was an excess of private

investment over private savings, which ominously widened prior to the crisis. Only in Singapore was there

a persistent large excess of private savings over private investment. Hence, the net capital in$ows into the

Asian economies were driven primarily by the fact that private investment was exceeding private savings in

the region.

It is also worthwhile considering whether the exceptionally high rates of investment throughout the 1990s

- f over 30% of GDP in most of these countries were sustainable – even in the case of the Philippines and
Taiwan the rates were in the 20–25% range. Although the o'cial figures may overstate actual investment
by including in certain instances elements of consumption, there is some evidence presented by Corsetti
et al. (1998) that such investment was beginning to become less productive in the run-up to the economic
crisis (1993–96) compared to the earlier period (1987–93). In the case of Korea, some 20 of the 30 largest
conglomerates had rates of return on capital below their costs of capital, and seven of them were close to
bankrupt. Indeed, in Korea the 1996 debt/equity ratio of the top 30 _chaebols_ was estimated to be in excess of
300% in the run-up to the crisis, with some of them having debt/equity ratios as high as 3,000%.

Table 17.7 shows some interesting data concerning capital $ows into the Asian region in the run-up to

and during the crisis. !ere were high net capital in$ows into the region right up until the crisis broke in

mid-1997. It is important to note that many of the capital in$ows were of a short-term nature, but by the end

- f 1996 the share of short-term debt to total debt was typically above 50% in the region. Indeed, the ratio
- f short-term liabilities to foreign exchange reserves was above 100% in the cases of Korea, !ailand and
Indonesia. It was the sudden and dramatic reversal of these $ows that lay at the root of the crisis that then
ensued. Our analysis of the macro-fundamentals suggests that a sudden reversal could not have been easily
predicted from the macrodata, and we thus need to investigate in more detail the background to the crisis and
make some attempt to account for the sudden withdrawal of foreign capital.

17.7 THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL FACTORS IN THE CRISIS

!ere can be little doubt that a number of external factors also played an important background role to the

economic crisis:

1. Following the collapse of its property and stock market bubbles at the end of the 1980s, Japan

spent most of the 1990s in economic recession. Interest rates were kept at very low levels and this

encouraged a capital out$ow from Japan into the South East Asian economies, enabling them to

finance excessive investment projects with relative ease.

2. Some argue that a loss in the cost-competitiveness of the Asian economies can be traced back to a

50% devaluation of the Chinese renminbi in 1994. However, this has been disputed by authors such

as Edison et al. (1999) who argue that many business transactions were carried out at the new parity

long before the actual devaluation occurred.

3. Financial deregulation had attracted large foreign banks to invest heavily in the region. International

banks believed that their loans were effectively underpinned by the governments in the region, thus

leading to a moral hazard problem. !e belief that loans were guaranteed either by the governments

    - r by the potential for IMF bailout packages may have contributed to a climate of excessive lending

that ultimately made a crisis more likely to occur than if the perceived insurance schemes had not

been in place.

4. In April 1997 the Japanese government imposed a consumption tax that is widely credited with

leading to an abrupt decline in consumer expenditure in Japan. !is in turn had a noticeable impact

    - n the exports of its Asian trading partners. !e tax was also widely credited with stalling Japan’s

fragile economic recovery.

From mid-1995 onwards there was a sharp effective appreciation of the US dollar in relation

to the Japanese and European currencies, which led to a deterioration in the competitiveness

    - f those Asian)economies that had pegged their currencies to the US dollar. Given the lags

between)exchange)rate effects and trade this began to impact upon their export performance

in)1996/97.

A combination of the above factors meant that the Asian economies were vulnerable to changes in market

sentiment. Before we proceed to examine the factors that were of more immediate concern in causing this

change in sentiment we need to examine the crucial role of the financial sector in the crisis. In particular, we

need to examine the linkage between the capital $ows outlined in Table 17.7 and the expansion of domestic

credit that fuelled the stock market and property boom in the region in the run-up to the crisis.

17.8 THE ROLE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

!e role of the banking system in financial crises in emerging economies has been noted in a number of

studies such as Kaminsky and Reinhart (1996) and Goldfajn and Rodrigo (1997). !e occurrence of financial

crises has o(en occurred with a lag following a period of financial liberalization. For instance, Jeffrey Sachs in

the _Financial Times_ (18 September 1997) has argued that:

!roughout … South East Asia banks have been deregulated and privatized in recent years, allowing

them much greater latitude to borrow from abroad. Banks and near-banks such as !ailand's now

notorious financial trusts – become intermediaries for channelling foreign capital into the domestic

economy. !e trouble is that the newly liberalized banks and near-banks o(en operate under highly

distorted incentives. Under-capitalized banks have incentives to borrow abroad and invest domestically

with reckless abandon. If the lending works out, the bankers make money. If the lending fails, the

depositors and creditors stand to lose money, but the bank owners bear little risk themselves because

they have little capital tied up in the bank. Even the depositors and the foreign creditors may be secure

from risk, if the government bails them out in the case of bank failure.

!e pivotal role of the banking system and its relationship with the government and the corporate structure in the

East Asian crisis is perhaps far more important to an understanding of the economic crisis than any deterioration

in the macroeconomic fundamentals. !e governments in the South East Asian economies had tried to foster

high rates of economic growth and they applied political pressure on domestic banks to lend to corporations and

- n the corporations themselves to undertake heavy investment programmes to achieve this. To induce firms to
undertake such investment programmes governments provided direct subsidies, tax concessions and in many
cases public guarantees. More importantly, state-run banks were directed to extend credit to corporations largely
without a proper evaluation of the risk–return nature of the investment being undertaken. !e domestic banks

- btained easy finance from a mixture of domestic residents and from foreign banks and investors who thought
that their loans were effectively guaranteed by the governments of the South East Asian economies.

It is also important to appreciate in this context that the Asian banking system suffered from many

weaknesses (see Mishkin, 1999), including lax supervision, weak regulation, insu'cient skills in the

regulatory bodies, low capital adequacy ratios, poor project selection schemes and even corruption in lending

practices. !e banks used inadequate credit-scoring mechanisms and were subject to political manipulation

in their lending criteria, resulting in credit being extended to firms without any proper regard to profitability.

!is resulted in non-performing loans (NPLs) taking up an ever-increasing proportion of their loan book. In

addition, governments were heavily enmeshed in the corporate culture with political favouritism, a history of

government 'bailouts' of failing firms and little real concern for profitability. !is severe structural weakness

in the Asian banking systems meant that the foreign capital in$ows were not e'ciently intermediated.

Given the generally underdeveloped nature of the bond and equity markets in the South East Asian

countries, the banks have a very significant role in the Asian financial systems. For example, in Indonesia

the banks were responsible for around two-thirds of corporate finance, while the stock market provided only

a third in the run-up to the crisis. Most capital in$ows were therefore intermediated one way or another by

local banks. It was when the loans intermediated by local banks and financial houses started to become nonperforming that foreign investors became eager to pull their money out of the region. As Table 17.8 shows,

NPLs were particularly high in the countries most heavily affected by the crisis, namely Indonesia, Malaysia,

Korea and !ailand.

One of the major impetuses for the foreign capital in$ows into Asia was the financial liberalization that

took place in the 1990s. !e $ows of capital were also encouraged by fixing exchange rate parities vis-à-vis

the US dollar, which lowered the perceived exchange risk premium on investment in these countries. It seems

that international banks believed that, should their lending go sour, they would either be bailed out by the

local government or obtain an indirect bailout through IMF involvement in the event of any problems in

the region. Such beliefs were to some extent fostered by declarations, such as those made by the Indonesian

Finance Ministry which announced in 1994 that it would not permit a state bank to default and that the

government supported 'forced' mergers in instances where a private bank was in trouble. McKinnon and

Pill (1996) argue that international banks in the run-up to the crisis had lent huge amounts of funds to the

region's domestic banks with little regard to any detailed risk-assessment. Evidence of a lending boom fuelled

by foreign capital in$ows is documented in Corsetti et al. (1998), and Table 17.9 shows a significant upward

movement in bank lending to the private sector in all of the countries studied.

In all the countries under study we can see that there was a significant increase in bank lending to the

private sector as a percentage of GDP, and the fact that GDP was rising strongly in this period must also be

borne in mind. In the three countries where the lending boom was the greatest – namely the Philippines,

!ailand and Malaysia – it is noteworthy that these were the countries most hard hit by the crisis in 1997.

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

in all of the economies during the period 1991 to 1996, which seems to have started to come to an end in

1997. !e concentration of foreign loans to the property sector and the financing of speculation in the equity

markets meant the banking systems were particularly vulnerable to any asset de$ation.

!at there was an asset and property bubble in these economies cannot be easily refuted – see for example

Sarno and Taylor (1999). !e Hong Kong market quadrupled in 1990–96, the !ai and Philippines markets

rose by over 240% and speculation drove property and land values to unsustainable levels.

17.9 THE IMMEDIATE CAUSES OF THE CRISIS

It is not completely clear what was the spark that ignited the crisis. !e first major corporate failure took

place in Korea in January 1997, when Hanbo Steel collapsed under the weight of \$6 billion of debts; it

was soon followed by Sammi Steel and Kia Motors. !e collapse of these companies meant problems for

the local merchant banks that had either borrowed significantly from foreign banks to finance lending to

these companies or who had provided guarantees to foreign investors that had made direct loans to the

companies.

Pressure on the !ai baht had begun to emerge at the back end of 1996, fostered by concern about its large

current account deficit and increasing reliance on short-term foreign capital. In addition the !ai stock market

had begun a steep decline as early as February 1996: the market fell over 30% in 1996 and a further 30% by

mid-1997. !e Korean market fell 26% in 1996 and the Malaysian market began to decline in February 1996,

but other markets did not show any sign of weakness right up to July/August 1997 (see Table 17.11). Pressure

had been mounting on the !ai baht as early as July 1996 when, following the collapse of the Bangkok Bank of

Commerce, there had been a large injection of liquidity into the financial system by the Bank of !ailand. In

February 1997, Samprasong Land (a !ai property company) missed debt payments due to foreign creditors

and in so doing signalled the start of a collapse in the local property market and serious trouble for local

finance companies with heavy loan exposure to property companies. While the Bank of !ailand committed

some \$8 billion of loans to assist financial institutions facing di'culty, this proved insu'cient to deal with

the magnitude of the debts. !e pressures on the financial system continued through to 14 May 1997, when

the !ai stock market fell nearly 7%, and on 19 June, following the resignation of the Finance Minister, a

staunch supporter of the currency peg, the stock market fell nearly 11% in a single day. In a bid to save the

!ai baht from devaluation the Bank of !ailand engaged in substantial forward purchases of the currency,

representing a massive drain on its foreign exchange reserves. !e battle to save the baht from devaluation

ultimately proved unsuccessful when, following the withdrawal of support from the !ai authorities, Finance

One (a major finance company) announced that it would not be able to meet payments to foreign or domestic

creditors. !is announcement came as a major shock to foreign creditors and led to such a massive withdrawal

- f funds that the baht was forced to devalue on 2 July 1997.

!e !ai devaluation then seems to have triggered international investors' concerns about the entire

region. A successful speculative attack was launched against the Philippines peso which was forced to $oat

- n 11 July. !e crisis soon spread to Malaysia where the property sector had been experiencing a speculative
bubble. Local banks had lent significant sums of money to fuel speculative equity and real-estate investments
and the party started to come to an end in March 1997 when the central bank announced restrictions on
lending for real estate and property purposes. !e announcement came as a shock to foreign investors and led
to a sharp drop in the Malaysian Stock Exchange which had a heavy weighting to the property and financial
sector. !e speculative pressure against the ringgit came to a crescendo following the Philippine devaluation,
which was forced to $oat on 14 July. !e Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed launched a vitriolic

461

International Finance

attack against 'rogue speculators' and introduced controls on capital out$ows and against the short-selling of

equities and the ringgit in the forward exchange market.

!e contagion element of the crisis is perhaps best illustrated by the case of Indonesia. Although Indonesia

had many weaknesses such as a poorly regulated financial system, 'crony capitalism' characterized by political

nepotism and a persistent current account deficit, things were not that bad. Indonesia had avoided any major

corporate bankruptcies, the government had been running fiscal surpluses and the exposure of the commercial

banking system to foreign creditors at around 6% of GDP was well below that of other countries in the region,

although corporate debts to foreign creditors were fairly significant. Despite this, the rupiah came under intense

speculative pressure and was forced to $oat on 14 August 1997. !e resulting depreciation, combined with a

rise in interest rates designed to protect the currency, resulted in Indonesia being dragged into the crisis, and

September to December saw a plunge into a severe crisis situation. Although a letter of intent was signed with the

IMF on 31 October that secured a \$40 billion support package it had little impact on the crisis, and in November

the Indonesian stock market fell some 20%. !e illness of President Suharto in December only added to the

crisis atmosphere and by the beginning of 1998 Indonesia had become the investment pariah of the region.

Political instability in the region also played a background role in the crisis: there were major cabinet

reshu%es in !ailand; the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed attacked 'rogue speculators'; and

elections in Indonesia, combined with the ill-health of its President Suharto and his unpredictable policies,

combined with presidential elections in Korea, all added to the sense of political and economic instability in

the region.

In November 1997 the Hong Kong dollar came under intense speculative attack, since speculators felt its

peg to the US dollar was no longer sustainable given the other devaluations that had occurred within the

region. !erea(er, for the best part of a year it seems that there was a continual battle between the Hong

Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and speculators over the sustainability of the Hong Kong dollar peg.

Speculators simultaneously shorted the Hang Seng index and sold the Hong Kong dollar forward. !e bet

proved very lucrative for the speculators since the HKMA was forced to raise interest rates to defend the

Hong Kong dollar parity, which depressed the Hong Kong property and stock market. !e battle between the

speculators and the HKMA was only finally resolved in October 1998 when the HKMA started to buy shares

to boost the Hang Seng index.

By November 1997 South Korea had been dragged into the crisis and speculative attacks were launched

against the Korean won, and even a Korean rescue package with the IMF announced on 21 November failed

to end the speculative pressure, as the terms of the deal which included tax rises and spending cuts were

viewed by the markets as likely to worsen the plight of the economy. Rumours also surfaced in December that

Korea would declare a debt moratorium and on 11 December the Korean markets suffered significant declines

following a Moody's downgrade of its foreign-currency-denominated bonds. For a while Japan also became

a subject of concern following the closure on 24 November of the fourth-largest securities house Yamaichi

Securities, and on 19 December foodstuff trader Toshoku filed for bankruptcy, leading to concerns that more

would follow. Indonesia added to the sense of panic by reneging on promised structural reforms.

By mid-January 1998, somewhat calmer markets returned as a result of the news that international banks

had agreed to roll-over much of Korea's short-term debt, and on 19 January Indonesia's agreement to a tough

IMF package was also welcomed. However, once again the calm was short-lived as Indonesia started to $irt

with the idea of introducing a currency board and the IMF made it clear that it was not going to support

Indonesian plans to peg the rupiah to the dollar. From February up until the end of May, markets did not stage

a comeback nor did they collapse, rallying somewhat on the announcement of trade surpluses in !ailand (13

March) and tumbling on news of unrest and looting in Indonesia, which eventually led to the resignation of

President Suharto in May 1998.

462

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

17.10 AN ANALYSIS OF THE CRISIS

Mishkin (1999) argues that the weak position of the Asian banking system with regard to the increasing

percentage of non-performing loans (NPLs), when combined with their fixed exchange rate systems, made

speculative attacks far more likely to succeed. When banks' balance sheets are weak, speculators know that

central banks' attempts to defend the currency via interest rate hikes are likely to fail since they increase

the percentage of NPLs and weaken still further the banks' balance sheets, eventually making devaluation

inevitable. In 1996 it has been estimated that NPLs as a proportion of total lending was 8% in Korea, 13% in

Indonesia, 10% in Malaysia, 14% in the Philippines, 13% in !ailand and 4% each in Singapore and Taiwan,

and 3% in Hong Kong. Exposure to the property market was particularly high in Hong Kong, Malaysia,

Singapore and !ailand, whilst in Korea and Indonesia most of the bank exposure was to manufacturing

companies. For instance, in 1996 the Malaysian banking system's exposure to the property and equity sector

was some 42.6%, while exposure to the manufacturing sector was around 21%. Once the crisis got under way

it had a dramatic impact on the proportion of NPLs, which reached an estimated high of over 30% in Korea

and !ailand at the peak of the crisis.

Once devaluations and drops in property prices and stock markets got under way in the region, the crisis

took on a life of its own. !e devaluations meant large foreign exchange losses for domestic banks and firms

whose liabilities to foreign banks were largely unhedged since they had believed in their government's pledges

to maintain fixed exchange rates. !e drop in property and equity prices also caused substantial losses and

- utright defaults by many property companies and those playing the markets with margin accounts. In
summary, local banks were hit simultaneously on many fronts – the withdrawal of foreign funds, substantial
foreign exchange losses, a sharp rise in the percentage of non-performing loans and losses on equity holdings.
!e resulting rapid rise in the proportion of non-performing loans further accelerated the withdrawal of
foreign funds, which in turn led to further falls in the local currencies, property sector prices and stock
markets, so completing the vicious circle. !e erosion of the banking system's capital bases due to all of these
factors severely constrained their ability to lend to even solvent companies in the midst of the crisis.

!e withdrawal of foreign capital also meant a severe liquidity crisis. !e liquidity squeeze forced up local

interest rates which meant that local firms had considerable di'culty in obtaining finance just when they

needed it to cover their foreign exchange losses and service higher debt payments. !e rise in NPLs of the

local banking systems made foreign banks even more reluctant to roll-over any loans. !ere can be little doubt

that this reluctance was reinforced by the absence of any effective local bankruptcy laws and concerns that

local lenders would receive preferential treatment as compared to foreign creditors.

It is also apparent there was very little discrimination made between the various countries in the region as

international banks and foreign investors (including mutual funds) decided _en masse_ to pull funds out of the

region. !e crisis was thus characterized by contagion and herding behaviour on the part of foreign investors

and banks, and there were many ways in which the so-called contagion effect came into play during the Asian

crisis. As we have mentioned in section 17.4, when one currency was devalued it raised questions about the

sustainability and credibility of other fixed parities within the region. !e competitive advantage conferred to

the devaluing country also raised the prospect of a slowdown in the export growth of competitor countries, so

calling into question other exchange rate pegs. Similarly, as capital was pulled out of one country, so forcing it

to raise its interest rate, this had the effect of forcing up the interest rates in competing countries. When local

companies get into di'culty it is generally the case that domestic banks recall loans lent to foreign businesses

in the region first, so spreading the credit squeeze across borders. Furthermore, a downturn in the local

economy directly impacts on the exports of other countries in the region.

463

International Finance

!ere also seems to have been a problem of imperfect information: foreign investors faced with insu'cient

information were unable to distinguish the bad from the not so bad countries and so reacted in a fairly

uniform manner by removing capital from all of them. !e role of speculators, including hedge funds, in

foreign exchange crises cannot be underestimated: having made a great deal of money by successfully betting

against the !ai baht it was only natural for speculators to switch their attention to testing the sustainability

- f other currency pegs in the region.

It is important to understand that it was not just US and European banks that scaled back their lending to

the region. In particular, Japanese banks, who were facing further erosion to their already weak capital bases

as a result of losses from their Asian exposure, decided to call in many of their loans to the region. Similarly,

Korean banks that were faced with extensive problems due to their exposure to the heavily indebted _chaebols_

started to call in loans they had extended to the rest of Asia. !e attempt by speculators to force a devaluation

- f the Hong Kong dollar led to the raising of interest rates by the HKMA, and apart from placing pressure
- n the already beleaguered Hong Kong stock market and property sector by raising the interest payable on
deposits, some Hong Kong banks were forced to recall loans they had made to the rest of Asia.

In retrospect, there were also policy errors conducted by the local governments that probably exacerbated

the crisis. For example, the !ai authorities might have been better off allowing the baht to $oat freely rather

than exhausting their foreign exchange reserves trying to defend the parity. Both the !ai and Korean

authorities initially spent huge amounts of money trying to keep a$oat companies that were clearly headed

for liquidation. In the case of !ailand the authorities' refusal in late June 1997 to save Finance One, contrary

to previous promises, brought into question the credibility of all their other guarantees. Indeed, it can be

plausibly argued that the reneging on the commitment to save Finance One was the crucial match that ignited

the Asian crisis. !e existence of 'crony capitalism' was seen to be in play in Indonesia where IMF and state

funds were directed at trying to save the business interests of President Suharto's relatives. !e early imposition

in August 1997 by the Malaysian and !ai authorities of foreign exchange controls once the crisis began only

heightened the desire of foreign investors to get out of the region and probably contributed to subsequent

downgrades by the credit-rating agencies.

!e currencies that fell most during the crisis (Table 17.12) were those of countries with the largest currentaccount deficits. !e Hong Kong dollar parity was successfully defended by the HKMA against speculative

attacks throughout the crisis. Most noticeably, the two surplus countries, Singapore and Taiwan, witnessed

their currencies fall by relatively modest amounts of around 20%; indeed, during the crisis the decline of the

last two currencies was far more orderly. Hence, there is some evidence that there was a link between current

accounts and the exchange rate turmoil.

17.11 THE IMF HANDLING OF THE CRISIS

Once the crisis was under way economic agents were generally very keen to exit the region and the initial IMF

plans were signed but not adhered to by the governments. !is was particularly the case in Indonesia where

the Suharto regime ignored virtually all of its commitments and only reversed policy once the rupiah went

into freefall. Likewise, initially, the IMF package for Korea was only grudgingly accepted, and in !ailand it

was only the onset of a new government that was committed to economic reform that finally stabilized the

baht. !e overall IMF programme to the region had a number of objectives:

1. Prevention of default on the part of the Asian countries;
2. Prevention of a freefall in their exchange rates;
3. Prevention of the emergence of in$ation;
Maintenance of sound fiscal discipline;
Restoration of investor confidence in the region;
Structural reform of the financial sector and banking system;

7. Structural reform of the corporate sector, in particular the ending of so-called 'crony capitalism';
8. Rebuilding of foreign exchange reserves;
9. Limiting the decline of output.

!e key instruments used by the IMF to achieve these objectives were:

 - **Bank closures.** !e IMF was very keen to ensure that the least-viable banks were closed down. !ose
banks that remained open were expected to restore their capital ratios to above the 8% required by
the Basle Accord. In !ailand some 58 out of 91 finance companies were suspended, of which over
55 were eventually liquidated. In its agreement with the IMF the !ai banks were expected to have
a capital adequacy ratio of 10% by the end of 1997 and 12% by 2001. Similarly, in Korea 14 out of 30
merchant banks were suspended in a move designed to restore confidence in the banking system. In
the case of Indonesia the IMF insisted on the closure of some 16 banks. !e IMF policy focused on
closing down the banks with the highest proportion of non-performing loans.

 - **Fiscal discipline.** !e IMF regarded the maintenance of fiscal discipline as crucial to the successful
management of the crisis. In its programme for !ailand it stated that 'fiscal policy is the key to the

	- verall credibility of the programme'. In its initial packages it required that the Asian economies
actually run budget surpluses equivalent to 1% of GDP. !e IMF viewed the maintenance of fiscal
discipline as crucial since government funds would be needed to assist in the eventual recapitalization

	- f the banking systems, restoring foreign confidence and helping to improve the balance of payments
position of the deficit countries.

 - **Monetary discipline.** As is typical of IMF packages, limits were set on the creation of domestic credit,
and interest rates were raised in an attempt to reduce capital out$ows and relieve pressures on the

465

International Finance

currencies. !e IMF recognized that the higher interest rates would harm the corporate sector in the

economies but judged that the benefits from exchange rate stability would more than offset this. For

instance, the Deputy Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki on 30 January 1998 stated:

We know that higher interest rates are likely to hurt the corporate sector, but an appreciation

     - f the currency that follows a tightening of monetary conditions would greatly benefit those

corporations indebted in foreign currency. !ere is no alternative in the short term. A relaxation

     - f monetary policy would only lead to further depreciations of the currencies.

 - **Structural reform of the banking and corporate sector.** While IMF programmes are usually
concentrated on ensuring the pursuit of fiscal and monetary restraint on the part of the crisis country,
they are usually limited with regard to financial sector and corporate reform. However, in the Asian
crisis this was not the case; the IMF believed that in the longer term there was a need to reform the
banking and corporate structure in the Asian economies by a more radical policy of restructuring and
liberalization, which involved the closing of numerous banks, reducing tariffs, reducing state aid and
the opening-up of the region to foreign direct investment in the economies. As Michel Camdessus,
the Managing Director of the IMF, emphasized:

In view of the nature of the crisis, these programmes had to go far beyond addressing the major

fiscal, monetary or external balances. !eir aim is to strengthen financial systems, improve

governance and transparency, restore economic competitiveness, and modernize the legal and

regulatory environment.

17.12 AN EVALUATION OF THE IMF PROGRAMMES

Authors such as Radlett and Sachs (1998) have criticized the IMF programmes as being unduly harsh and

indeed exacerbating the crisis, the policy on bank closures coming in for particular criticism. !ey argue

that the requirements to close many of the banks added to the credit squeeze on the private sector, created a

sense of panic on the part of international investors and led to a series of bank runs as local residents sought

to safeguard their savings. For instance, by the end of November 1997 two-thirds of Indonesian banks had

suffered a run on their deposits. !e policy of recapitalization is also harshly criticized by Radlett and Sachs:

they argue that the raising of capital adequacy ratios greatly and unnecessarily added to the credit crunch on

the corporate sector. However, in the IMF's defence it regarded structural reform as absolutely essential since

problems in the banking sector lay at the heart of the crisis. !e IMF also believed that without structural

reform, the chance of restoring foreign confidence and capital $ows back to the region would remain low.

Moreover, the major bank runs that had occurred in Indonesia were not repeated on anything like the same

scale in !ailand and Korea.

!e fiscal and monetary programmes have also come in for quite a lot of criticism, most notably from the

Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz (2002), who argued that the tough fiscal discipline combined

with higher interest rates meant that the contraction in economic output was greater than would otherwise

have been the case. As we have seen, at the time of the crisis, the Asian economies were actually running

fiscal surpluses or relatively small deficits and their national debt to GDP ratios were also not excessively

high. However, as noted previously the IMF believed that fiscal restraint was essential, partly as a corrective

mechanism for helping the current account to return to surplus and partly as a means of preventing further

466

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

wastage of scarce government resources on low marginal return projects. !e containment of government

expenditure was regarded as particularly important, given that public funds would be needed to recapitalize

and restructure the banking systems.

On the monetary front the rise in interest rates which should in theory have helped strengthen the

currencies did not succeed in doing so. !e currencies in fact depreciated even more heavily following the

initial IMF packages, despite the steep rise in interest rates and the exchange rate targets set. It appears to be

the case that the squeeze on local companies and the increase in non-performing loans on the books of the

banking system probably added to the sense of crisis and may have further exacerbated the withdrawal of

foreign capital. However, this argument is not as clear-cut as it seems: if the countries had not raised their

interest rates, it may well have been the case that their currencies would have depreciated even more than they

did, which would have exacerbated the losses for domestic banks and companies that had unhedged foreign

currency debts. Furthermore, larger falls in the currencies of the region could well have led to hyperin$ation

and even more disruption to economic activity than actually occurred.

While there is no doubt that the initial IMF policy programmes were quite tough, the policies became

somewhat so(er as the extent of the economic downturn in the Asian economies became evident. For example,

the original Indonesian package negotiated in October 1997 required Indonesia to run budget surpluses

equivalent to 1% of GDP in the fiscal years 1997/98 and 1998/99, but a subsequent agreement reached in June

1998 permitted a budget deficit of up to 8.5% of GDP.

!e moral hazard problem is a recurrent theme with respect to IMF interventions, the argument being that

IMF bailouts actually make crises more likely than if it did not intervene. However, this argument should clearly

not be taken too far, since in most economic crises investors are probably not expecting an IMF intervention

when investing their funds. Indeed, most investors would probably be very reluctant to lend funds if they felt

that there was a reasonable chance that the country might need to seek emergency assistance from the Fund

in the near future. Furthermore, during crises most investors do end up losing substantially – in the Asian

crisis it is estimated that foreign investors in the bond and equity markets in the affected countries lost in the

region of 50–80% of their capital as the value of their investments in the region plummeted. In addition, the

idea that governments will be more inclined to pursue imprudent policies knowing that the IMF will likely

come to the rescue cannot be taken too seriously. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most governments are

extremely reluctant to go to the IMF as it is taken as a clear sign of economic policy failure and usually results

in the government falling or failing to get re-elected. It is also important to bear in mind here that if there was

no IMF to act as a lender of last resort, then there would be a significant danger of even greater panic. !e IMF

programmes and loans also act as an institutional buffer to limit potential contagion effects. In the absence

- f the IMF the risk of even greater regional dislocations, disorderly markets and possibly a more significant
global financial crisis has to be considered.

17.13 THE CRISIS AND POST-CRISIS PERFORMANCE OF THE ECONOMIES

As can be seen in Table 17.1 there were very significant falls in economic output in many of the crisis-hit

countries during 1998, with real GDP falling by 13.1% in Indonesia, 10.5% in !ailand, 7.4% in Malaysia and

6.9% in Korea. !ese output falls were dramatic, especially as these economies had been used to growing at the

rate of 5–8% per year. However, fortunately, the slump in economic activity proved to be relatively short-lived

and during 1999 and 2000 the economies rebounded strongly, although their growth rates during the first few

years of the new century were generally significantly lower than in the early 1990s. What is also clear from

Table 17.4 is that there was a dramatic improvement in their current accounts during 1998, though this was

467

International Finance

driven primarily by a massive fall in imports induced by the dramatic fall in output in the a%icted economies

and the effects of the large exchange rate depreciations which encouraged exports and made imports more

expensive. In general it seems that the real depreciations of the effective exchange rates that occurred in all the

economies since 1997 led to an improved current account position in all the economies post-1997, compared

to the current account deficits in the run-up to the crisis.

!e fiscal situation, however, seems to have undergone a significant deterioration as shown in Table 17.5:

fiscal surpluses of the early to mid-1990s were replaced by fiscal deficits in most of the economies. !ese

fiscal deficits have come about partly because of the costs of the crisis itself in terms of the bailouts of some

- f the financial institutions and companies, repayment of loans to international institutions, the increased
unemployment and also the slower economic growth rates that the economies have experienced since the
crisis. In addition, the savings and investment data reported in Table 17.6 – which changed quite dramatically
during the crisis as savings rose and investment collapsed – seem to have undergone a marked change
compared to the pre-crisis era with savings rates generally higher and investment rates somewhat lower than
before the crisis.

In summary, the output effects of the crisis were quite dramatic but the recession itself, while sharp, was

relatively short-lived. !ere does, however, appear to have been a more significant change in some of the

crucial economic relationships in these economies, most noticeably the improved current account balances

and deterioration in the fiscal balances, meaning that private savings and investment relationships seem to

have undergone a quite significant change due to higher savings and lower investment rates than before the

crisis. !e depreciation of the real effective exchange rates of the economies made them significantly more

competitive in 2004 than in 1997.

17.14 EARLY-WARNING SYSTEMS

Given the number of currency and financial crises that have occurred in recent years, economists, policymakers and market participants have been keen for different reasons to develop early-warning systems (EWSs)

that may be useful in predicting the timing and probability of a financial crisis; Kaminsky et al. (1998) is one

- f the pioneering papers in this respect. !e aim of an early-warning system is to look at various economic
and financial indicators for signs prior to outbreak that a crisis is highly likely to occur in the near future (say
within 12–18 months). Ideally, of course, an EWS as well as detecting potential crises should avoid giving out
false signals, that is, predict a crisis when one does not in fact occur. An EWS would be useful for financial
market participants in that it would give them a chance to reduce their potential risk exposure (and of course
take speculative positions) and also provide useful information to policy markets who, forewarned of a crisis,
could be expected to take pre-emptive measures against an actual outbreak of a crisis.

!e Kaminsky et al. (1998) paper uses a 'signal' approach to devising an early-warning system. !is

involves looking at a selection of various economic and financial indicators that may exhibit unusual

behaviour prior to the outbreak of a crisis: each time an indicator exceeds a predetermined threshold a

signal is generated predicting a crisis. It is essential that the thresholds are not set too low or the EWS will

generate too many false signals, that is, predict a currency crisis when no crisis occurs. On the other hand,

the thresholds should not be set so high that too few signals are generated and the EWS fails to predict a

crisis when one actually occurs. !e aim of an EWS is to predict a currency crisis within one to two years

- f the actual crisis occurring. A signal can be considered useful on the basis of three alternative metrics: (1)
its probability of predicting a crisis (the higher its success rate the better), (2) the length of time in advance

- f a crisis that the prediction is made (the more in advance the better), and (3) the persistence with which it

468

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

predicts a crisis (the more o(en it warns of a crisis that actually occurs the better). !e following matrix can

be used to evaluate the usefulness of a variable in predicting a crisis:

|Col1|Crisis(within24months)|Nocrisis(within24months)|
|---|---|---|
|Signal was issued|_A_|_B_|
|No signal was issued|_C_|_D_|

where _A_ is the number of months in which the indicator predicts a crisis and a crisis subsequently occurs, _B_ is

the number of months the signal provides a false signal of a forthcoming crisis, _C_ is the number of months the

indicator fails to produce a signal and a crisis occurs, and _D_ is the number of months the indicator produces

no signal and no crisis occurs. A good indicator is one that has lots of _A_ and _D_ - bservations and relatively few

_C_ and _B_ - bservations. A useful measure is the ratio _A_ /( _A_ + _C_ ) which shows the number of good signals that

the indicator issued as a percentage of the total number of signals that it could have produced, since a good

indicator will have a relatively high percentage of predicting a crisis when one actually occurs.

In their paper, which is essentially empirical in nature, Kaminsky et al. look at a variety of potential

indicators of a currency crisis, informed partly by the literature on speculative attacks. For instance, the firstgeneration models predict that the level of the money supply relative to the level of foreign exchange reserves,

the size of fiscal deficits and also of current account deficits can provide useful early-warning signals, whilst

the second-generation models argue that deviations of output below trend, high levels of unemployment or

high levels of public debt may be useful indicators since they weaken the resolve of the authorities to defend

a fixed exchange rate parity. !e paper also reviews a large range of studies that have looked at numerous

currency crises covering both developed and developing countries, and at a huge range of potentially useful

indicators.

Kaminsky et al., in surveying the literature of currency crises, place variables into one of six categories:

(1) the external sector, (2) the financial sector, (3) the real sector, (4) public finances, (5) institutional and

structural variables, and (6) political variables. A variable is only considered to have some usefulness if the

ratio of false to good signals that it generates is below unity. In their empirical analysis, the authors find

that output levels, deviations of the real exchange rate from trend, banking crises indicators, exports, the

ratio of broad money supply to reserves, the in$ation rate and equity prices provide useful EWS signals.

More surprisingly, current account deficits, fiscal deficits and the differential in real interest rates between the

domestic and foreign economies do not provide useful signals for the EWS. !ey conclude that a good system

needs to consider a variety of economic and financial variables.

We should perhaps not expect too much from an EWS, since no two crises are exactly alike and the

economic, financial and political variables which provoke a crisis can vary greatly and interact with each other

in o(en unpredictable ways. Just as a butter$y $apping its wings can provoke a hurricane in another part of

the world in chaos theory, so too can a minor event provoke a full-grown speculative crisis which was largely

unforeseeable. In addition, Flood and Marion (1999) make the point that currency crises are in practice

largely unforeseen by market participants, because macroand financial fundamentals are not indicating an

impending crisis as seems to have been the case in Asia, hence an EWS based on such indicators is likely to

have only a limited success rate. As they put it, 'the more unpredictable the crises, the less likely they are to

be significantly correlated with the information variables selected as possible crises determinants. Moreover,

if the potential determinants of currency crises differ across countries and across time, panel regressions that

look for consistent patterns may perform poorly' (p. 18).

17.15 CONCLUSIONS

Our interpretation of the Asian financial crisis has been informed by a mixture of the three generations of

currency crisis models. !ere are, however, reasons to believe that none of these models alone is su'cient to

explain the crisis, although elements of each were to a greater or lesser extent present during the crisis. For

instance, the devaluation of many of the currencies was preceded by current account deficits and a depletion

- f the foreign exchange reserves of the Asian countries, which is a characteristic of the Krugman model,
though the necessary fiscal deficits in this model were not evident. It is probably fair to say that the secondgeneration models do somewhat better than the first-generation models at explaining the Asian financial
crisis. Indeed, Krugman (1999, pp. 8–9) has acknowledged as much: 'I hereby capitulate. I cannot see any way
to make sense of the contagion of 1997–1998 without supposing the existence of multiple equilibria'. Likewise,
Masson (1998, p. 6) states that 'the fact that the optimistic view about East Asian economies prevailed for
so long (in the face of some reports of banking sector problems), the rapidity of the change of view, and the
suddenness and severity of the resulting crises all argue in favour of the multiple equilibria story'. !ere is
also no doubt that there was an explosion of risky lending to the region prior to the crisis and many of the
foreign banks that lent to domestic banks and companies in the region felt that there were explicit or implicit
government guarantees on their loans which led to the 'moral hazard' problem that is a characteristic of
the third-generation models. While it can be disputed whether the bubbles in the local property and stock
markets were rational or irrational, the proposition that bubbles were present cannot be easily refuted. Finally,
the withdrawal of foreign capital when the crisis arrived was both sudden, disorderly and characterized by a
high degree of panic which is characteristic of the Sachs (1995) model.

We have argued that although there were signs of a deterioration in the macroeconomic fundamentals,

these were not of a su'ciently large order to explain the magnitude of the financial crisis that subsequently

erupted. Far more significant in explaining the crisis was the lax lending by the local banking systems, fuelled

by excessive speculative foreign capital in$ows to the region. Much of the foreign capital was used in either

unproductive investments or to fuel an unsustainable boom in asset prices, most notably in stock market and

property valuations. !e need to re-establish fair values for property and equity prices then triggered the crisis

by undermining the quality of the loan portfolio of the domestic banks. !e magnitude of the financial crisis

that followed can then also partly be explained in the context of contagion theory and herding behaviour,

particularly on the part of foreign banks and international investors exposed to the region. Some of the blame

for the magnitude of the crisis can also be apportioned to policy errors by the affected national governments

and the initial IMF response.

A central contention of this chapter is that the Asian financial crisis was predominantly caused by excessive

foreign-financed credit expansion which resulted in unsustainable asset bubbles rather than any significant

macroeconomic weaknesses in the Asian economies. !e resulting financial crisis would have been far less

severe if international investors had rolled over their loans and not all tried to exit simultaneously from the

region. Once this happened, a self-reinforcing crisis was set in motion. As Radlett and Sachs (1998, p. 2) put

it, 'a combination of panic on the part of the international investment community, policy mistakes at the onset

- f the crisis by Asian governments, and poorly designed international rescue programs have led to a much
deeper fall in (otherwise viable) output than was necessary or desirable'.

In the context of the recent crises it is worth bearing in mind that many of them have been regional in

nature. One can think of the Latin American debt crises of the 1980s, the ERM crisis of 1992–93 and the

East Asian financial crises of 1997–98. Research by Glick and Rose (1999) suggests that there may be good

reasons for crises to become regional in character. Firstly, the economies o(en compete with one another in

international trade so that a devaluation of one country's currency will give it a competitive advantage over

470

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

- ther countries,)and this may then mean speculators will target the other countries' currencies which have been
adversely affected by the initial devaluation. Secondly, devaluations are o(en followed by recessions which slow
down intra-regional trade and growth, making other currencies in the region ripe for speculative attack. !eir
empirical estimates show that trade linkages between the country that is initially subjected to a speculative
attack and its trading partners are a statistically significant explanatory variables in regional currency crises.
Nevertheless, there is mounting empirical evidence (see, for example Fratzcher, 2003) that financial linkages
between countries are perhaps more important in explaining contagion and regional currency crises.

A recurring theme in financial crises is that extensive dependence on foreign capital leaves a country

especially vulnerable since foreign banks are less likely to be willing to renew lines of credit in the event of

a crisis than domestic banks. !e question of whether the imposition of capital controls on the out$ow of

capital during a crisis can help to mitigate the crisis is very controversial. !e main argument in favour of

controls on the out$ow of capital is that it would enable the authorities to get away with a lower domestic

interest rate than would otherwise be the case, and limiting the sales of the domestic currency would help

restrict the depreciation of the local currency which in turn would restrict foreign exchange losses and the

risk of uncontrolled in$ation. Authors such as Krugman (1998b) have argued that China was largely able to

ride out the Asian crisis because the yuan was inconvertible. Economic theory gives little guidance on the

subject, since in a second-best world the addition of a further distortion such as capital controls may or may

not raise economic welfare. !ere are, of course, longer-term adverse consequences from deploying capital

controls, such as ine'ciency, the potential for a misallocation of capital and lower economic growth, but

it is not too clear that these outweigh the short-term benefits in times of economic crisis, especially when

many of the capital movements are driven by panic and contagion effects. However, even during a crisis the

imposition of capital controls may not always be beneficial. Once one country imposes capital controls this

can lead to foreign investors accelerating capital $ight from other countries before they too decide to impose

controls. Indeed, capital might be pulled out of otherwise sound emerging market economies so that the crisis

is amplified. Some commentators have suggested that the imposition of capital controls by Malaysia in August

1998 may have been a factor in spreading the Asian crisis to Latin America.

!e Asian crisis certainly did show that the speed and sequencing of capital account liberalization

is an important issue. Such liberalization, as had occurred in the region, needs to be done gradually and

be accompanied by strong supervision of the domestic banking system – and indeed the corporate sector

aimed at avoiding a build-up of excessive short-term foreign liabilities on the part of domestic banks and the

domestic corporate sector.

!e signs of financial and economic recovery that started in 1999 in the East Asian economies may be

taken as evidence that the 1997–98 financial crisis was an overreaction on the part of market participants.

!e speed and size of the recovery was partly achieved by a return of confidence induced by the adoption of

more realistic IMF programmes and a recognition by market participants that the deterioration in economic

fundamentals was not of a su'cient magnitude to warrant the fall in currency and asset prices that actually

- occurred. Indeed, with the benefit of hindsight the exaggerated currency depreciations and falls in equity
markets created an excellent buying opportunity for foreign investors seeking to gain exposure to the region.
