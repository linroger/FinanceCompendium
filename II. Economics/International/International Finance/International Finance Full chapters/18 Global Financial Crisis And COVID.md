18.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter you will learn about: financial innovations such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)

and credit default swaps (CDSs), the causes of the credit crunch, the failure of Lehman Brothers and AIG,

the financial cost of the credit crunch, the measures taken by the authorities in response to the crisis and the

policy lessons and implications of the credit crunch. In addition, we look at the impact of the Covid-19 global

health and economic crisis and the policy response.

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

A number of financial innovations have been developed since the 1990s through to the present. !ese new

financial instruments such as collateralized debt obligations and credit derivatives including credit default

swaps played a significant role in the so-called credit crunch which is generally considered to have started

- n 9)August 2007. On that date BNP Paribas warned investors that they would not be able to withdraw
money from two of its funds due to a 'complete evaporation of liquidity' in the market. In addition, the
European Central Bank pumped &95 billion of liquidity into the markets, followed a few days later by a further
&108.7 billion. Up until the outbreak of the credit crunch financial innovation had generally been viewed as a
good thing for financial markets and the economy. It was believed that risk could be divided up into various
tranches and transferred from market participants wishing to reduce their risk exposure to other participants
prepared to take on greater risk exposure. However, the credit crunch showed that rather than reduce risk
exposure, much of the financial innovation had in fact built up the level of risk to such a high level that there
was a major breakdown in the banking and financial systems. In April 2009, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) estimated that there would be close to $4.1 trillion of losses in financial institutions worldwide. !e
scale of the financial crisis was unprecedented in modern times and comparisons were made with the global
depression of the 1930s.

!e chapter begins with a look at two of the key financial instruments linked to the credit crisis,

(i))collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and (ii) credit derivatives with a particular emphasis on credit

default swaps (CDSs). As we shall see, these two financial securities played a pivotal role in the crisis, so an

understanding of these instruments is essential to understanding how the credit crunch impacted so heavily

upon the banking sector and, in the case of CDSs, was directly related to the failure of American International

Group (AIG). Prior to the outbreak of the crisis AIG was the world's largest insurance firm, but it had to be

bailed out to the tune of approximately $180 billion by the US taxpayer in September 2008. We then proceed to

look at the credit crunch, analysing the role played by the financial innovations and the responsibilities of the

different players involved in the crisis. !ese players include individuals such as the former chairman of the

Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, heads of banks and financial companies such as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae

and Citigroup, and organizations including financial regulators such as the Securities Exchange Commission

(SEC) and the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the rating agencies, governments, financial institutions,

and ultimately households and companies that took on unserviceable debt levels.

18.2 FINANCIAL INNOVATION: COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS

In this section we look at some of the key financial innovations that played a significant role in laying the

foundations for the credit crunch. As we shall see, to some extent these financial innovations were linked

to each other during the financial crisis. In theory each of these instruments has clear benefits in helping to

manage risk and transfer it to those willing to take on the risk. In practice, however, they did not work as well

as they should have. In large part the failure lay in the fact that CDOs and other structured finance products

were 'misunderstood, mis rated, mis-sold and mispriced'.

_Collateralized debt obligations_

A **collateralized debt obligation** (CDO) is a security that bundles together a range of different debt obligations

and/or a package of bank loans into a financial security that is divided up into various tranches, with each

tranche having different risk and return characteristics. !e best way to illustrate a CDO is via a simple example.

473

International Finance

Example of a CDO

Imagine that a series of mortgage loans equivalent to $500 million has been made to various borrowers. Some

- f these borrowers are high-risk (for example, loans to subprime borrowers) and some are mediumto lowerrisk (for example, Alt-A and prime borrowers). If fully serviced the interest payable on the loans is equivalent
to 10%, resulting in an interest cash $ow of $50 million plus principal repayments each year. A possible CDO
that can be formed is illustrated in Figure 18.1.

!e original set of bank loans with a zero default rate would yield $50 million per annum of interest income.

!e bank that made the loans may try to o%oad a large part of the risk on the loans by bundling the various

loans and packaging them into a CDO. !e first tranche (Tranche 1) is known as the **equity tranche** and is the

riskiest part because, if there is a default on the first $25 million of principal and interest, then the holders of

the equity tranche would be wiped out. Since this is the riskiest part of the CDO it attracts the highest rate of

interest, in this example 30%. Typically the equity tranche is not assigned a rating as it is understood to be high

risk. If the default rate goes above $25 million then Tranche 2 – the **junior tranche** - is next at risk. !e value

- f the junior tranche in the example is $100 million, so if losses/defaults on interest and principal increase to
$125 million this tranche would also be wiped out. Since the junior tranche is the next in line a(er the equity
tranche, it will have a relatively low credit rating, for example BBB, and attract a lower yield of, say, 15%. !is
yield is lower than that of the equity tranche but higher than the next tranche at risk, which is Tranche 3 –
the **mezzanine tranche** . Holders of the mezzanine tranche will only incur losses if defaults rise above $125
million, but they will be wiped out if losses hit $250 million. !e safest tranche, which was frequently given a
AAA rating, is Tranche 4 known as the **senior tranche** . It is only once losses exceed $250 million that losses
will be suffered by owners of this tranche. Since it is the safest tranche it attracts the lowest rate of return; in
the example, this is set at 6% per annum.

Since the various tranches of a CDO have different risk–return characteristics the credit rating agencies

such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's play a pivotal role in assigning credit ratings to them. When assigning

its credit ratings, Moody's applies a methodology that looks at the default correlations between the various

securities in the pool, the average credit quality of the pool of securities, the structure of the CDO and expected

losses to each tranche. !e fact that the CDO was sliced up into various tranches makes it an attractive security

for different types of investors – for example, pension funds would be attracted to the AAA tranche, hedge

funds to the junior tranche and other banks to the mezzanine tranche.

474

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

Although the above example gives a good idea of what a CDO is, there are a number of additional important

points that need to be made. !e first is that each CDO is a unique package; the quality of the CDO and the

credit rating attached to each of its tranches will depend upon the quality of the original bank loans and

how these have been packaged in the CDO. Another point is that even if some of the borrowers default on

their bank loans there is likely to be some recovery against the assets owned by the defaulting borrower. For

example, if one of the loans in the CDO is for $500,000 against a house purchase then if the borrower defaults

the bank will still be able to foreclose on the home and this will have some value, say $300,000 a(er recovery

expenses, that can be used to repay the CDO holders. !ere are likely to be some covenants in the CDO that

make it hard for the originating bank to reschedule and renegotiate loans with the original borrowers if they

are having di'culty making payments.

All of these factors make the pricing of a CDO a very complex issue as the cash $ows of each CDO are

highly uncertain. Assumptions about timings of defaults, default rates, recovery rates, the impact of covenants

and the fact that each CDO is unique combine to make designing the correct pricing structure a di'cult task.

As we shall see later in the chapter, the complexity of the CDOs and di'culties of determining their secondary

market values ultimately became quite crucial in the evolution of the credit crunch.

It should be noted that many CDOs were issued by banks to free up capital that the bank would otherwise be

forced to hold against those loans. If loans are made and then the risks of the loans sold off to other investors,

then banks have new capital to make further loans, undertake share buy backs or develop new products while

freeing themselves of the credit risk of the loans they have made. In our example, suppose that the bank has a

loan book worth $500 million and is required to hold regulatory capital of 8% (that is, $40)million) to cover

potential losses. By selling the CDO the bank sells 95% of its loan book, retaining the equity piece worth

5% of the $500 million – it is required to hold 100% of the equity piece, that is $25 million, for regulatory

capital purposes. As such the bank has managed to reduce its regulatory capital holding from $40 million to

$25)million, a saving of $15 million. In addition, it has raised $475 million from selling the CDO. Of course,

the debt repayments on the loans are now used to make payments to the holders of the various tranches of

the CDO rather than accrue to the bank. As such, the returns the bank gets on its $475 million cash received

from the CDO become crucial to determining the overall profitability of creating the CDO.

!ere are variations in CDOs. One of the most notorious is the CDO squared (CDO [2] ), which is a CDO

based upon a package of existing CDOs or tranches of differing CDOs. A collateralized loan obligation (CLO)

is simply a CDO based upon a package of loans, such as a package of auto loans, student loans or credit

card loans. A collateralized bond obligation (CBO) is a CDO based upon a pool of bonds, such as a pool

- f corporate bonds. One issue of concern with a CDO is the asymmetric information involved – the bank
creating the CDO is more likely to understand the quality of the loans behind the CDO than outside investors.
!is problem is partially solved by the bank retaining the risky equity tranche of the CDO, so that it suffers the
first loss before outside investors. Also by holding the equity tranche, the bank is more likely to monitor and
enforce the loan than if the entire loan has been sold off to a third party.

18.3 SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE/SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY

When a CDO or other securitized product is sold onto the market it is usual for a bank to sponsor the

formation of a **special purpose vehicle** (SPV), or special purpose entity (SPE) in the USA. An SPV/SPE is a

legal entity set up for a specific limited purpose by another entity or a sponsoring firm. An SPV/SPE can take

- n one of three forms: a trust, a partnership, or a limited liability company. !e SPV/SPE may be a subsidiary
- f the sponsoring firm, or it may be an 'orphan' SPV/SPE, one that is not consolidated with the sponsoring

475

International Finance

firm for tax, accounting or legal purposes (or may be consolidated for some purposes but not others). An

SPV/SPE is normally incorporated in an offshore centre such as the Cayman Islands.

In the context of a typical securitization, the SPV/SPE takes the form of a trust which is 'demonstrably

distinct' from the sponsoring bank in that the sponsoring bank cannot unilaterally dissolve the SPV. In

addition, the SPV/SPE must be 'bankruptcy remote', which means it will not be dissolved if the sponsoring

bank were to go bankrupt, and the SPV/SPE is structured in such a way that it cannot itself become legally

bankrupt. !e fact that the SPV/SPE is bankruptcy remote provides some comfort for investors in the SPV/

SPE since it cannot go under if the sponsoring bank were to get into trouble. An SPV/SPE is set up for a specific

purpose or circumscribed activity or a series of such transactions. SPVs/SPEs have no other purpose than the

transaction(s) for which they were created. !e SPV/SPE can make no substantive decisions since the rules

governing them are set down in advance and carefully circumscribe their activities. An SPV/SPE is merely a

legal/accounting entity with no employees or even physical location. A typical SPV is thinly capitalized, its

assets are serviced by a servicing department and its administrative functions are performed by a trustee that

follows pre-specified rules with regard to the receipt and distribution of money.

A bank transfers loans or mortgages to the SPV/SPE, which then securitizes the pool of assets into a

securitized product such as a CDO or an asset-backed security (ABS) and manages the cash $ows from the

assets to ensure payments to investors in the CDO or ABS. By sponsoring the transfer of assets to the SPV/

SPE, the parent bank can in theory eliminate its risk because writedowns on the assets due to non-payment

by borrowers will be suffered by the SPV/SPE and not the parent bank. In this sense an SPV/SPE is different

from a subsidiary company because losses by the subsidiary would hit the profitability of the parent company.

By setting up a separate company to manage the securities the bank is able to isolate itself from the financial

risks. However, it is important to understand that the sponsoring bank o(en makes implicit commitments

to the SPV/SPE, known as 'implicit recourse' or 'moral recourse', whereby it is expected to provide credit

and other support beyond its contractual obligations. !is is widely recognized by regulators, credit rating

agencies and the sponsoring bank such that the sponsoring parent bank will suffer a loss even though, from a

legal/accounting perspective, it is not required to do so.

18.4 A STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLE

!e first structured investment vehicle (SIV) was set up in 1988 by Citigroup, and SIVs have since become

part of what is popularly known as the 'shadow banking system'. An SIV is a pool of assets and liabilities

that attempts to exploit the difference between shortand long-term interest rates. !e basic idea of an SIV

is in essence quite simple – to raise funds at the short end of the market at relatively low rates of interest

and invest those funds in longer-term securities at higher yields. !e aim of the SIV is to capture the spread

between the low funding costs of their short-term liabilities and higher returns on their longer-term assets.

A typical SIV would raise money from the money markets primarily through the issuance of short-term

commercial paper of, say, 90 and 180 days and medium-term notes with a maturity of 1 to 2 years. !e

funds are then invested in a variety of longer-term securities such as corporate bonds, Treasury bonds

and structured finance products including ABSs and CDOs made up of things like mortgages, credit card

receivables and student loans. !e typical spread income for an SIV is 20 to 30 basis points. A typical SIV

has some basic equity funding (initial capital) and usually employs a large degree of leverage, typically

between 10 and 20 times the equity funding. One motivation for banks to set up SIVs is that they are far less

regulated than the bank itself, and the requirements for capital against losses are usually much lower than

that required by regulators.

476

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

One obvious risk of SIVs is that in a liquidity crisis they would be unable to roll over their short-term

liabilities (that is, refinance them once they mature). As such, an SIV would typically seek a backstop facility

from a parent bank or group of banks, enabling it to cover some of its issuance in the event of market disruption

that prevented it successfully issuing some of its commercial paper. It is important to note that an SIV is a

separate legal entity and its commercial paper issuance would be given a credit rating from one or both of the

major credit rating agencies (Standard & Poor's and Moody's). In certain cases, SPVs/SPEs sell their assets to

an SIV which is mainly financed by the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP).

!ere are a number of differences between SIVs (shadow banking) and the traditional banking model.

Under the traditional banking model the bank acts as an intermediary, dealing directly with depositors and

borrowers and a lot of effort is put into screening the credit worthiness of the borrowers in particular. In

contrast, the SIV is dependent on the short-term wholesale markets for funding and is therefore reliant on

the work of the credit agencies to establish the credit worthiness of the securities it invests in. Another key

difference is that in the traditional banking model the providers of funds (the depositors) are to some extent

protected by the deposit guarantee provided by, for example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

(FDIC) in the USA or the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the UK. !is is not so in the case of buyers

- f the commercial paper and medium-term notes that fund the SIV who are subject to the risk of substantial
losses if the SIV were to get into trouble.

!e SIVs were badly affected by the credit crunch. As it became apparent that a lot of the banks were in

trouble, banks stopped lending to each other. !e SIVs also found themselves in trouble as they had invested

heavily in CDOs and subprime mortgages. !e SIVs quickly found themselves unable to refinance their

commercial paper except at very high rates of interest, and had to start selling some of their assets, such

as CDOs, at heavily discounted prices into a distressed market. !e credit rating agencies also started to

downgrade the ratings of the SIVs during the crisis, which either made funding themselves with commercial

paper prohibitively expensive or made them reliant on bank credit lines to continue operating. Hence, the

SIVs were badly hit by a combination of liquidity risk, because they were unable to roll over their commercial

paper, and solvency risk, because the value of their assets fell below the value of their liabilities. One result of

the credit crunch is that SIVs became unviable and by the end of 2008 there were no SIVs in operation.

18.5 CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

Another significant financial innovation that played a crucial role in the credit crunch was the development

- f credit derivatives and in particular **credit default swaps** (CDSs). A credit derivative is a contract between
two parties – a protection buyer and a protection seller – in which the seller sells credit protection to the buyer
against the credit risk of a third party. !e third party is known as the **reference entity** and may be a company

- r a government that has issued debt. Credit derivatives fall into two categories: unfunded credit derivatives
and funded credit derivatives.

1. With an unfunded credit derivative the contract between the two parties means that payments

are cash settled. For instance, the protection buyer will pay premiums in cash and receive a cash

settlement from the seller of the credit risk protection if a credit event occurs.

2. With a funded credit derivative the party that assumes the credit risk, that is the protection seller,

will make an initial payment that can be used to settle a credit event. !is feature makes a funded

credit derivative a lot safer since the protection buyer does not need to concern themselves with the

counterparty risk of the protection seller.

477

International Finance

!e meaning of a credit event is crucial and will be specified in a credit derivative contract. It may include

the bankruptcy of the reference entity, a restructuring of payments by the reference entity, a failure by

the)reference)entity to make a scheduled payment or a moratorium on payments by the reference entity (see

Box 18.1).

_Credit default swaps_

!e most common credit derivative is a credit default swap (CDS), which is similar to an insurance product.

In theory there are good reasons to believe that insurance against a default is a good idea. However, the

uncontrolled writing of CDS contracts by the leading insurance company American International Group

(AIG) ultimately led to its failure and resulted in it being taken over by the US government. In 2007 the

International Swap and Derivatives Association (www.isda.org) reported that the total amount of credit

derivatives outstanding was $62.2 trillion, up from $0.5 trillion in 2000 (see Table 18.1). !e main centre

for trading in credit derivatives is London and the vast majority of trading in such contracts is conducted

by insurance companies, commercial and investment banks, securities firms, hedge funds, pension funds,

speculators and corporations in the over-the-counter market.

A CDS is a credit derivative contract in which one party (the protection buyer) pays a periodic fee to

another party (the protection seller) in return for a payout in the instance of a credit event by a reference

entity. It is important to understand that the reference entity is not a party to the CDS, and it is not necessary

for the protection buyer to suffer an actual loss in order to be eligible for a payout if a credit event occurs.

When a credit event occurs, the protection buyer will issue the protection seller a credit event notice

making the basis for a claim against the protection seller. In effect, a CDS enables the protection buyer to

short the credit risk of the reference entity, while the protection seller is taking a long position on the credit

risk of the reference entity. Each contract sets out the specific terms of the agreement including identification

- f the underlying asset (loan or bond), what constitutes a credit event and the settlement process. !e vast
majority of CDS contacts have a non-bank corporate as the reference entity, followed by CDS contracts with

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

**Box 18.1 What constitutes a credit event?**

!e International Swaps and Derivatives Association specifies five things that could constitute a credit

event. A credit default swap will specify one or more of the five as constituting a credit event, and so

trigger payments from a protection seller to a protection buyer.

   - **Bankruptcy** : A corporate becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts. !e bankruptcy event
is, of course, not relevant for sovereign issuers.

   - **Failure to pay:** Failure of the reference entity to make due payments greater than the specified
payment requirement (typically $1 million), taking into account some grace period to prevent
accidental triggering due to an administrative error.

   - **Obligations acceleration/obligations default** : Obligations that have become due and payable
earlier than they would have been because of default or similar condition or obligations have
become capable of being defined due and payable earlier than they would have been because of
a default or similar condition. !e latter description is the more encompassing definition and
is generally preferred by the protection buyer. !e aggregate amount of obligations must be
greater than the default requirement (typically $10 million).

   - **Repudiation/moratorium** : A reference entity or government authority rejects or challenges the
validity of the obligations.

   - **Restructuring changes** : Restructuring changes in the debt obligations of the reference creditor,
excluding those that are not associated with credit deterioration, such as a renegotiation of
more favourable terms.

banks as the reference entity. Trading in sovereign CDS contracts, contracts in which the reference entity is

government debt, has been growing over the years. !e growth has been especially strong in bonds issued by

emerging market economies where the risk of a credit event is, generally speaking, significantly higher than

for developed market economies. A typical credit default swap is set out in Table 18.2.

Table 18.2 shows the details of a straightforward CDS on company ABC. !e duration of the contract is

5 years and the notional size of the contract is $10 million of debt. !e contract is to be settled by means of

physical delivery of bonds with a face value of $10 million and a maturity of 5 years to the protections seller,

who will pay the difference between the secondary value of the debt and the face value of the debt in the event

- f a bankruptcy filing by company ABC. !e possible payout profiles are depicted in Figure 18.2.

!e quarterly premium which is typical for corporate CDOs is simply determined by the face value of the

contract times the basis points per annum times 0.25 to re$ect the quarterly premium payable. In this case, the

annual premium is 100 basis points (i.e. 1% of face value of $10 million) therefore the quarterly premium is:

$10,000,000                  - 0.01                  - 0.25 = $25,000

so that the annual premium is $100,000 to insure against the risk of default on $10 million of debt, payable in

quarterly instalments of $25,000.

It is important to understand that the contract typically lasts for five years and the premium payable is set

by the protection seller for the lifetime of the contract. !ere is, however, a secondary market for the CDS

premiums once issued. If the credit worthiness of the reference entity deteriorates then this will be re$ected

in a rise in the basis points payable in the secondary market. For instance, if the likelihood of company ABC

filing for bankruptcy rises a(er one year then the basis points charged will rise from, say, 100 to 150 basis

points. !e premiums payable on the secondary market would then rise from $100,000 per year to $150,000

per year, meaning a potential profit of $50,000 a year for the remaining four years of the contract, or $200,000

in total, for a protection buyer. Note that the maturity of the CDS does not need to correspond to the maturity

- f the underlying debt of the reference entity – it is quite usual for the CDS to specify a debt instrument (for
example, bonds with 10 years to maturity) with a longer term to maturity than the CDS (typically five years).

Although CDS contracts are like an insurance product in many ways there are some characteristics that

make them quite different. !e protection buyer does not need to have any interest in the reference entity or

to have suffered an actual financial loss to make a claim if a credit event occurs. In other words, the protection

buyer may or may not hold any debt issued by the reference entity. By contrast, with a normal insurance

product you need to have an 'insurable interest' in the item you insure; for example, you can insure your own

house as you will suffer a loss if it burns down, but you will not normally be allowed to insure a stranger's

480

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

house and benefit if it burns down. Also, an insurance contract pays out a buyer if a loss has actually been

sustained, whereas a CDS contract is more akin to a bet on whether a 'credit event' will or will not occur.

Furthermore, since CDSs are over-the-counter products, they do not involve the same actuarial analysis

as a typical insurance product. Instead, the analysis is based upon the financial strength of the reference

entity issuing the underlying credit asset (loan or bond). Unlike insurance products which require regulatory

capital to be set aside to meet prospective claims, there are no regulatory capital requirements imposed on the

protection seller. In addition, since the protection seller has no relationship with the reference entity then the

seller cannot make a claim against or sue the reference entity.

Once a credit event occurs either one or both parties issues a credit event notice to the other party, based

upon publicly available information such as specified news sources, which if validated will trigger the settlement

- f the CDS. !ere are two ways in which a CDS can be settled: cash or physical settlement. With a physical
settlement the protection buyer delivers the face value of the underlying security or comparable securities
specified in the CDS contract ( _pari passu_ - r equivalent securities) to the protection buyer in exchange for the
face payment on the security. !e protection seller will then own the security and will be able to claim against
the reference entity or sell the security on to another party at the then prevailing secondary market price.
With cash settlement, the protection buyer will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the difference between
the par value of the security and a secondary market price of the security. !e secondary market price is
normally obtained from five dealers some 14 to 30 days a(er the occurrence of the credit event. In instances
where no reliable secondary market price can be determined, then cash settlement will be based upon other
instruments of similar quality and characteristics, such as maturity, outlined in the contract. It should be
noted that the protection buyer will stop all premium payments once a credit event has occurred, and this also
needs to be factored into the appropriate premium charged by the protection seller.

Rather than have a payoff based upon the difference between the face value of the security and its

secondary market price or recovery price, a **fixed recovery CDS** (or binary swap or digital swap) fixes the

amount of the payoff to be made should a credit event occur. !e fixed recovery CDS therefore removes

uncertainty over the payoff for both the protection buyer and protection seller. !e fixed recovery CDS can

be used to speculate on the recovery rate. For instance, say the protection seller assumes that there will be

a 50% recovery rate in the event of a default. If he sells protection on a CDS with a fixed payment of 40% of

the face value of the bonds, that is, $4 million for a $10 million contract, and the recovery rate is 50%, then

he will receive $5 million upon recovery and make $1 million of profit plus the premiums received. If the

actual recovery rate is below 50%, say only 30%, then the protection seller would make a loss of $1 million

less the premiums received.

!ere are variations on the basic CDSs that we have outlined. For example, it is possible to have a CDS

contract that is based upon a basket of reference entities and a payment is made when one of the reference

entities incurs a credit event. Some CDSs require an upfront fee to be paid in addition to the quarterly

premiums. Such upfront fees can be particularly high if the reference entity is close to bankruptcy; for

example, an upfront fee could be $2 million to $3 million (on a notional value of $10 million) if a company

has a high likelihood of filing for bankruptcy. Some CDSs are based upon a credit reference asset rather

than a credit reference entity. In such contracts, the recovery rate on the underlying asset is important to the

payout; for example, senior secured debt in the reference entity will have a higher recovery rate than junior

unsecured debt in the reference entity. With a contingent CDS, a payout requires both a credit event and an

additional trigger. !e additional trigger could be a credit event by another reference entity or a specified price

movement in some market security. In a dynamic CDS the notional amount determining the payout is linked

to the mark to market value of a portfolio of swaps.

481

International Finance

One problem with CDS contracts is that they are bought and sold as individual contracts and appear not to

be subject to securities laws. !ere is no regulatory body that governs the buying and selling of CDSs. While

the International Swaps and Derivatives Association provides recommended CDS documentation guidelines

it is not a regulatory body that issues legally enforceable regulations. Also, since the protection seller does

not have to set aside capital against a credit event, the buyer of credit protection is subject to noticeable

counterparty risk.

!e first CDS products were developed in the mid-1990s and the market expanded rapidly from around

$631 billion in the first half of 2001 to an estimated $62 trillion in the second half of 2007. In the early 2000s

the CDS market changed in three substantive ways:

1. A secondary market developed and new parties became involved in the CDS market. !is

development made it more di'cult to determine the financial strength of the protection seller.

2. CDSs were issued for SIVs, ABSs, mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and even CDOs. !ese

investments no longer had a known entity by which to determine the strength of a particular loan or

bond, unlike the case for commercial loans, corporate bonds or municipal bonds.

3. !e CDS market became used far more for speculation rather than hedging. Rampant speculation in

the market meant that buyers and sellers of CDS contracts were no longer owners of the underlying

asset (bond or loan), but were just 'betting' on the possibility of a credit event of a specific asset.

18.6 THE PRICING OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES

!e pricing of credit derivatives is an enormously complex area and the level of modelling required is well

beyond the scope of this book. However, it is clear that there are two crucial factors that need to be borne in

mind when calculating the appropriate price of a credit derivative:

1. !e likelihood of default.
!e payment or payoff to be made in the event of a default.

!e likelihood of default will depend upon the credit rating of the reference entity, it being less likely to default

if it is an AA rated issuer than if it is a BBB rated issuer. !e payment to be made in the event of a default will

depend upon recovery rates if the issuer defaults. !e recovery rate will crucially depend on whether the debt

is senior (unsubordinated) or junior (subordinated). In addition, there is a difference in recovery rates for

senior secured bonds than for senior unsecured bonds and likewise between junior secured and unsecured

bonds. Traditionally, secured bonds have quite good recovery rates, in the region of 60 to 90 cents per dollar,

while junior unsecured bonds have much lower recovery rates, in the region of 10 to 25 cents per dollar.

Under certain highly restrictive conditions, the annual premium payable for a CDS is approximately

equal to the yield of a corporate bond, less the risk-free rate of interest, of the same length to maturity as the

reference entity. For example, if a five-year Treasury bond yields 5% and the reference entity issues a bond

with five years to maturity at 6% then the credit premium will be equal to 100 basis points or $100,000 per

annum on a notional principal amount of $10,000,000. Unfortunately, the calculation of the actual premium

payable is far more complex than this simplification. Nonetheless, the basic idea generally holds that the

higher the corporate bond spread the higher the CDS premium payable.

Having looked at the various financial instruments such as CDOs and CDSs and investment vehicles such

as SPVs/SPE and SIVs, we are now in a position to proceed to an analysis of the credit crunch.

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

**Box 18.2 Credit derivatives and the fall of American International Group**

American International Group (AIG) was the world's largest insurance group, dealing with all types

- f insurance including commercial, health, residential and life insurance. It was ranked as the tenth
largest company in the _Fortune_ 500 list of American companies in April 2007, and was, generally
speaking, a very profitable company. On 28 February 2008 it announced annual profits of $6.2 billion
and had a market capitalization of $95.8 billion with its shares trading at $50.50. However, by October
2008 its share price had collapsed below $1 following a dramatic rescue by the American taxpayer on
NaN.September.

In 1998 AIG Financial Products Division (AIGFP) made the fateful decision to get involved in selling

protection in CDSs, especially on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations which

were o(en made up of bundles of subprime mortgages. !ings went well during the period 1998–2006

as AIG was picking up premiums from selling the CDSs and making virtually no payouts. Insurance

is a great business to be in when you are collecting premiums and not having to make any payouts!

!e Financial Products Division employed around 430 staff, mostly in London, and had written some

44,000 complex, o(en long-term contracts with a notional value of $2 trillion. Over time, AIGFP had

become a multi-strategy hedge fund engaged in a variety of businesses. In addition to CDSs, it wrote

and traded equity, currency and commodity derivatives.

According to Gerry Pasciucco, who was given the job of unwinding AIG's exposures following its

collapse, it was AIG's exposure to fewer than 200 insurance contracts that were sensitive to its credit

ratings and the value of the underlying CDOs that led to its collapse. !ere were several features of AIG's

contracts on CDOs that made them potentially dangerous. Firstly, they were mostly unhedged and

the contracts required AIG to post billions of dollars of collateral if its credit rating was downgraded.

Secondly, AIG agreed to post collateral if there was a fall in the market value of the CDOs it insured,

even if there were no credit downgrades or defaults on the CDOs. As the credit crisis developed, the

price of CDOs that AIG had insured began to collapse and on 15 September 2008 the ratings agencies

downgraded its rating: Moody's cut AIG's rating from Aa3 to A2, Standard & Poor's and Fitch both

reduced its rating from AA– to A–. !e downgrades and fall in price of CDOs forced AIG to post

tens of billions of dollars of collateral with its counterparties, but the amount of collateral required

soon exceeded its resources. On 16 September 2008, the American government intervened, with an

$85 billion credit line in exchange for a 79.9% stake to prevent AIG's collapse. !e US government

deemed that AIG was 'too big and too interconnected' to fail. !e failure of AIG would have led to

severe financial problems in dozens of other major financial institutions that had paid premiums to AIG

to protect themselves against defaults in CDOs they owned.

In March 2009 AIG announced the largest ever loss in corporate history of $61.7 billion for its final

quarter of 2008, and it is estimated that its total losses could eventually be in excess of $180 billion. !e

government was forced to reveal payouts from AIG to some of its major counterparties. From late 2007

through 2008 Société Générale received $16.5 billion, Goldman Sachs received $14 billion, Deutsche

Bank received $8.5 billion and Merrill Lynch $6.2 billion. Had the US Treasury not made these payouts

then the problems facing some of these financial institutions would have been greatly exacerbated.

AIG caused a massive public storm in January 2009 when it revealed that it had set aside $450 million

in retention bonuses to pay some 400 of its staff who were in the process of unwinding its complex

trades. Many of these staff had been involved in writing the very contracts that led to AIG's failure but

483

International Finance

were deemed to be essential to successfully unwinding the complex trades that ruined the company. Not

surprisingly, in March 2009 Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, stated:

If there is a single episode in this entire 18 months that has made me more angry, I can't think of

   - ne other than AIG. AIG exploited a huge gap in the regulatory system, there was no oversight
   - f the financial products division, this was a hedge fund basically that was attached to a large and
stable insurance company.

18.7 THE CREDIT CRUNCH

!e credit crunch which started on 9 August 2007 is generally viewed as the most significant crisis to affect

the financial markets and the global economy since the 1930s. !e term 'credit crunch' refers to the sudden

and very significant tightening of lending conditions in the financial system which happened independently

- f o'cial interest rates. In particular, there was a pronounced fall off in lending, both between banks on the
interbank market and between banks and their clients. Many other features also came into play, such as an
increase in risk aversion combined with declines in the price of risky assets such as equities and corporate
bonds and a $ight to quality assets such as Treasury bonds. In the remainder of this chapter, we consider the
causes of the credit crunch, the issues raised by the crisis, the policy response to the crisis, its economic impact
and some of the lessons to be learned from it.

_The dimensions of the credit crunch_

!e 2007 credit crunch is generally considered to have been triggered by losses on subprime mortgages

in the USA, but its impact was too wide and too deep to be explained by losses in that sector alone. !e

crisis led to the two mortgage financing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with combined loans totalling

$5.5)trillion, being placed under the control of the US government, and in March 2008 Bear Stearns had to be

rescued through a merger with Bank of America. Shares in most of the top banks around the world plunged

dramatically in value, as depicted in Table 18.3.

!e crisis took a particularly nasty turn on 29 September 2008 when the investment bank Lehman

Brothers was placed into bankruptcy (see Box 18.3). !e Lehman bankruptcy set off significant falls in

global stock markets around the world. In order to survive the crisis, major commercial and investment

banks like Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch became heavily reliant on funds

and other support provided by the Federal Reserve and US Treasury. Another institution that found itself

drawn into the crisis was American International Group (AIG) that, due to losses from its London-based

Financial Products Division, had to be taken over by the American government with estimated losses in

excess of $180 billion.

While the crisis started in the USA, it quickly spread itself throughout the world. In the UK, during

September 2007 the Northern Rock bank found itself unable to fund its mortgage book, and it was subjected

to the first **bank run** since 1866 as depositors queued to withdraw their money. !e bank run was only halted

a(er the government guaranteed all its deposits. By February 2008 it became evident that Northern Rock could

not survive and it had to be nationalized. !e Bradford & Bingley building society was also caught out in the

crisis and had to be rescued and taken over by the Treasury in September 2008. !e demise of Northern Rock

was later eclipsed by the problems at the Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) which was rescued through a merger

with Lloyds TSB bank. !e rescue proved to be fateful to Lloyds TSB as losses in HBOS led to Lloyds itself being

drawn into the crisis and having to be rescued by the UK taxpayer who took a 45% stake in the bank. In March

2009 the stake was raised to 65%. Another major bank drawn into the crisis was the Royal Bank of Scotland

(RBS) which over several years had become the largest bank in the UK. In December 2007 it made the fateful

decision to take over the Dutch bank ABN Amro. !e acquisition proved ill-timed and was not subjected to the

same degree of scrutiny that such an acquisition would normally attract. !e huge losses that later emerged on

the ABN deal (estimated to be as much as &22 billion), coupled with the problems on its own loan book, meant

that RBS had to be rescued by the UK government, which took a majority 70% holding in the bank.

!e UK financial sector was heavily hit by the crisis in general with the fall off in mergers and acquisitions,

underwriting activity, IPOs, commercial paper and corporate bond issues leading to tens of thousands of job

losses. Globally, estimates put job losses in the financial services sector at 350,000 during 2008 and the first

half of 2009, approximately 20% of the pre-crisis workforce.

485

International Finance

While a great deal of the crisis was concentrated in the USA and the UK, it had a significant effect on both

commercial and investment banks in many other nations. In Switzerland the Union Bank of Switzerland

(UBS) had losses on its subprime exposure in excess of 40 billion dollars. In Germany, although the property

market had been stagnant for many years, many German banks had losses from CDOs and SIVs amounting

to tens of billions of euros. Banks in other countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and even Australia also

had large losses resulting from their holdings of subprime securities. More dramatically, banks in Iceland and

Ireland which had boomed in the preceding years were brought to the point of collapse.

**Box 18.3 The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy**

On 15 September 2008 Lehman Brothers Holdings, the fourth largest investment bank on Wall Street,

filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was the largest bankruptcy in US history, sparking large falls in

stock markets around the globe. !e collapse of Lehman Brothers and the downfall of its CEO Dick

Fuld became one of the biggest stories of the credit crunch, and set off the most complex bankruptcy

in history. Prior to its collapse, Lehman was a global investment bank dealing with a huge range of

interests covering investment banking, equity and bonds trading, derivatives, securitization and wealth

management. It had o'ces around the world, including New York, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong,

the Middle East and Latin America. Lehman Brothers had a long and distinguished history, having

  - riginally been formed as a cotton brokerage in 1850. Just prior to its collapse it was employing some
28,600 staff worldwide.

!e losses that brought Lehman down were primarily due to its large exposure to subprime

mortgages through its CDO holdings. !e precise reasons as to why Lehman had accumulated such

a large exposure to the subprime sector are unclear: it was either holding the risky tranches of CDOs

willingly or holding them unwillingly because it could not find buyers. In the second quarter of 2008

Lehman announced losses of $2.4 billion and its stock, which had been falling since the collapse of

Bear Stearns in March, began to decline dramatically. In a bid to protect shareholders the CEO Dick

Fuld looked around for interested parties which would be willing to buy Lehman, including Korea

Development Bank (KDB). However, on 9 September KDB made it clear that it was not going ahead

with a deal, leading to a continued collapse of Lehman’s shares. As things became critical, an attempt

was made to sell the company over the weekend of 13–14 September to Barclays or Bank of America,

but a deal could not be reached, and the Federal Reserve Chief, Ben Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary,

Hank Paulson, made it clear that they would not step in to save Lehman. So on 15 September Lehman

filed for bankruptcy, citing assets of $639 billion and liabilities made up of bank debt and bond debt of

$768 billion – a gap of $129 billion.

Lehman's collapse created great uncertainty in the financial markets because it was a counterparty to

tens of thousands of contracts around the globe. Many hedge funds and financial institutions for which

Lehman was acting as broker/money manager found their accounts frozen and had problems executing

trades. !e Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 504 points, interbank interest rates rose significantly and

there was a rush to withdraw funds from money markets around the globe.

!e rise and fall of Lehman Brothers became inextricably linked to the rise and fall of its CEO

Dick Fuld, who had presided over the company since 1994. He joined the firm in 1969 and became a

formidable fixed income trader, eventually rising to CEO. During the years to 2006, profits at Lehman

rose dramatically and in 2006 _Institutional Investor_ placed Dick Fuld as number one CEO in its Brokers

486

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

and Asset Managers category. In the eight years prior to Lehman's collapse he earned an estimated $300

million. From press accounts, it appears that Fuld was an authoritarian leader and did not listen to his

risk managers who were warning of potential trouble from the bank’s exposure to the subprime sector.

!e CDOs and CDSs being traded on Wall Street were very different instruments from those he had

traded in his days as a trader. !is, combined with his staff’s reluctance to give him a full picture of the

risks Lehman Brothers faced, probably contributed to the bank’s demise. !e bankruptcy of Lehman and

news of his earnings made Fuld a figurehead for Wall Street’s excesses. In December 2008, Fuld was the

inaugural winner of the _Financial Times_ ’ ‘Lex Overpaid CEO’ award for having received $40.5 million

in 2006 and $34m in 2007, the two years preceding Lehman's collapse. CNBC.com named Fuld at the

top of its list of 'Worst American CEOs of All Time', stating that he was 'belligerent and unrepentant'.

On 13 September 2013 www.money.cnn.com reported that Wall Street banks and lawyers had racked

up some $2.2 billion in fees for managing the break up and winding down of Lehman by July 2013. Fee

beneficiaries included bankruptcy consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal who had generated $657 million

and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges $484 million. !e _Wall Street Journal_ reported on 2 February

2015 that some $90.6 billion in cash had been raised for payment to creditors and that the process for

final settlement could extend to beyond 2018, making it a decade to finally settle the biggest corporate

failure in history.

18.8 CAUSES OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH

In the following analysis we shall argue that the credit crunch had multiple causes, many of which interacted

with one another in creating unsustainable levels of household debt and house prices. !is was especially true

in the USA and the UK, although housing bubbles were also evident in Ireland, Spain, Australia, Dubai and

even parts of China.

18.9 LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND DEREGULATION

Long before the credit crunch took place, there were background forces that encouraged banks to get more

heavily involved in the mortgage loan market. !e Basel Accord of 1988 required banks to hold less capital

for loans made for mortgages, which were regarded as relatively safe, than for consumer loans, which were

regarded as relatively risky. !is undoubtedly increased the incentive for banks to increase their mortgage

exposure. !e rescue of Long Term Capital Management in 1998 exacerbated the moral hazard in the financial

system. In 1999 the repeal of the **Glass-Steagall Act** and the setting up of the Federal Deposit Insurance

Corporation (FDIC) were key reforms. !e Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 had separated the US banking system

into two distinct types of banks: the commercial banking sector and the investment banking sector. Its repeal

followed heavy lobbying from the banking industry which argued that the distinction was not necessary

in the modern era, that it was hampering the competitiveness of the US banking system and that repeal of

the Act would bring greater stability to the financial system via diversification. !e repeal was important

in) that) it) enabled major commercial banks like Citigroup to get involved in the issuance of CDOs and

mortgage-backed securities, and in establishing SPVs/ SPEs, SIVs and other **conduits** that would ultimately

play such a significant role in the crisis. In addition, some believe that the investment banks' risk-taking

487

International Finance

culture started to permeate to the commercial banking sector following the repeal of the Act. !e other key

reform was the setting up of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect deposits in the

commercial banking sector.

!ese background factors combined with lax and irresponsible lending by banks and financial institutions,

who overestimated the ability of the process of financial innovation to manage and control their risks, were the

proximate causes of the crisis. Other contributing factors were the actions of the Federal Reserve following the dotcom bust and generally lax regulation of the financial system, the regulatory authorities having become convinced

that financial markets were engines of economic growth and were in general best le( to develop without excessive

interference from regulators. We shall argue that while the immediate trigger for the credit crisis was problems in

the subprime market, the magnitude of the eventual losses and the extent of the crisis strongly suggest that other

factors played a significant role in the crisis. In its 'Declaration of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World

Economy', dated 15 November 2008, leaders of the Group of 20 pinpointed a variety of causes:

During a period of strong global growth, growing capital $ows, and prolonged stability earlier in the

decade, market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and

failed to exercise proper due diligence. At the same time, weak underwriting standards, unsound risk

management practices, increasingly complex and opaque financial products, and consequent excessive

leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system. Policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in

some advanced countries, did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial

markets, keep pace with financial innovation, or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic

regulatory actions.

18.10 DETERIORATION IN BANK LENDING STANDARDS AND ADVERSE SELECTION

Another key factor behind the credit crunch was a deterioration in the quality of bank lending, especially the

rapid growth of lending to the subprime sector. In 1994 subprime loans were a mere 5% of total mortgage

- riginations and totalled $35 billion. By 1999 this had risen to 13% of originations and $160 billion of lending,
but by 2006 this had risen again to 20% of originations and $600 billion of mortgage lending. By March 2007
the total exposure amounted to $1.3 trillion. It seems that banks had moved from an originate-and-hold
model – meeting customers directly and screening them out – to an originate-to-distribute model whereby
they originated the loans, repackaged them into ABSs and CDOs and sold them to investors. !is was very
different from the traditional 'originate-and-hold' banking model, whereby banks originate the loans and keep
them and the risks on their own balance sheets. !e 'originate-to-distribute' model paid mortgage brokers an
upfront fee for each mortgage they arranged, and this encouraged them to emphasize quantity over quality
because no penalties were payable if the mortgagee later went into default or foreclosure. !e originator of the
loan also had less incentive to monitor the loan since the risk of the loan was ultimately going to be securitized
and passed on to investors in the form of a MBS or CDO.

Most of the subprime mortgage loans were adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with low initial interest

rates which would rise significantly a(er one or two years. Since the subprime mortgages were viewed as

risky the interest rate charges were significantly higher than for Alt-A or prime loans. !is in itself also meant

that subprime mortgages had a significant **adverse selection** problem in that the high interest rate charges

tended to attract a larger proportion of borrowers who would default on payments than would be expected

for traditional mortgages. It seems that another problem with subprime mortgages was that banks failed to

screen out the higher-risk loans. !e job of granting the mortgages was le( to mortgage brokers that obtained

significant commissions from the banks when a mortgage loan was made, and this led to predatory lending

488

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

practices in which mortgage brokers encouraged people to take on bigger loans at higher rates of interest than

they could afford. !e extent of the lax lending practices was typified by the so-called popularity of NINJA

loans, which stood for 'No verified INcome, Jobs or Assets'. In the UK there was also plenty of evidence of lax

lending standards. Northern Rock, which had to be rescued by the government, had a 'Together' package which

granted mortgages and loans equivalent to 125% of the value of the property being purchased. !ese loans

were being marketed aggressively to customers who in the past would have only been extended mortgages of

around 80% of the value of the property. Some commentators believe that the origins for the subprime crisis

can be blamed in large part on the Clinton administration which encouraged mortgage providers like Fannie

Mae and Freddie Mac to engage in increased mortgage lending to lowto moderate-income groups and

neighbourhoods which were much riskier than their traditional markets.

18.11 INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD INDEBTEDNESS

!ere was an increase not only of mortgage debt but also other forms of debt such as student loans, auto loans

and credit card debt. US household debt as a percentage of disposable income rose from 60% of disposable

income in 1974 to 134% of disposable income in mid-2008. !e savings rate in the USA declined from 6% in

1993 to under 1% by 2006, while the ratio of total debt to disposable income rose from 75% to 120% over the

same period in the OECD area. Much of the build-up of debt was securitized as CDOs or MBSs and bought

by banks, fund managers, pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds.

!e Federal Reserve also played a significant part in creating the credit bubble by reacting to the fall in

the stock markets following the dot-com bust in 2000 and the 9/11 terrorist attacks with an unprecedented

loosening of American monetary policy. It cut the Federal Funds rate from 6.5% in May 2000 to an all-time

low of just 1% in June 2003. In retrospect, many commentators regard this as an over-reaction to the bust

in the internet sector which accounted for less than 2% of the American economy. !e low interest rates

contributed to a rapid expansion of mortgages and a rapid rise in house prices over the period. Indeed, the

lower cost of finance contributed to a high degree of speculative activity in the housing market; for example,

in areas like Miami there was '$ipping' of condos by speculators who quickly on-sold properties they had

bought for short-term profits. Also, there was a growth in bank lending based on mortgage equity withdrawals

whereby people were able to take out new loans based on the higher value of their house.

18.12 FINANCIAL INNOVATION AND THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES

Financial innovation undoubtedly played a significant role in the crisis. Many of the banks that had increased

their mortgage book, particularly in the subprime area, believed they could reduce their risk exposure and

save on regulatory capital through securitizing the mortgage loans they had made by issuing MBSs and CDOs.

It is essential to realize that the banks could not have sold on the CDOs and MBSs without ratings on the

securities being issued by the credit rating agencies. Crucially, the credit rating agencies gave the securities

credit ratings that in retrospect clearly under-rated the risks involved. Securities that should have merited BBB

and lower ratings were issued with AAA and AA ratings. !e precise reasons why the credit rating agencies

got their ratings so wrong is a matter of dispute; it has been argued that they had big financial incentives to

rate the securities generously in return for generous fees. Also, the assumptions they made when rating the

securities were found to be wanting. !ey assumed continued house price rises and unrealistically low default

rates when making the ratings. !e fact that the securities were given investment grade ratings is absolutely

489

International Finance

crucial. If they had been rated below BBB then far fewer loans and mortgages would have been made, and

many banks and financial institutions would not have bought the securities and suffered catastrophic losses.

In addition to the growth of CDOs and MBSs a key financial innovation that contributed directly to the

downfall of AIG and Lehman Brothers and created problems for many hedge funds was their exposure to the

CDSs. !e notional value of CDSs grew from $500 billion in 2000 to $62 trillion by 2007.

18.13 INCREASED LEVERAGE IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

Another key factor that played a prominent role in the credit crunch was the increased use of leverage, defined

as the ratio of total debt to shareholder capital being employed by investment banks and other financial

institutions. For instance, Merrill Lynch increased its leverage from 15 to over 30 times capital between 2003

and 2007, Lehman Brothers increased its leverage from around 22.7 to 29.7 times capital, Goldman Sachs

from around 18.7 to 25.2 and Morgan Stanley from around 23.2 to 32.4 while Bear Stearns increased its

leverage from around 27.2 to 32.5. !e investment banks were not alone in increasing their leverage ratios as

many hedge funds were also highly leveraged, ratios of 20 to 30 times capital being common. !e problem of

increased leverage is that, although it increases returns during the good times, it also increases the risk level

and therefore the dangers facing financial institutions during periods of negative returns. In the period 2003

to 2007 the increased leverage became even more problematic because many of the funds raised by investment

banks were used to purchases tranches of CDOs and MBSs. In the view of some commentators the investment

banks were guilty of both producing and consuming toxic securities.

18.14 MISPRICING OF RISK

!ere is a lot of evidence that there was widespread mispricing of CDOs by market participants and credit

rating agencies who were using David Li's Gaussian copula model which based the price of CDOs on the price

- f related CDSs. However, in an article in wired.com, Felix Salmon (2009) reported:

Li's formula, known as a Gaussian copula function, looked like an unambiguously positive breakthrough,

a piece of financial technology that allowed hugely complex risks to be modeled with more ease and

accuracy than ever before. With his brilliant spark of mathematical legerdemain, Li made it possible

for traders to sell vast quantities of new securities, expanding financial markets to unimaginable levels.

His method was adopted by everybody from bond investors and Wall Street banks to ratings agencies

and regulators. And it became so deeply entrenched – and was making people so much money – that

warnings about its limitations were largely ignored.

!en the model fell apart. Cracks started appearing early on, when financial markets began behaving

in ways that users of Li's formula hadn't expected. !e cracks became full-$edged canyons in 2008 –

when ruptures in the financial system's foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival

  - f the global banking system in serious peril.

In sum, the pricing of the CDOs did not properly re$etc the risks of the securities and the pricing formula

underpriced the risks involved.

David Li's paper, 'On Default Correlation: A Copula Function Approach', was published in 2000 in the

_Journal of Fixed Income_, and was very quickly adopted by Wall Street and the financial community. Li had

490

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

come up with an ingenious way to model default correlations without looking at historical data, but instead

by using prices of CDSs. Li's copula function led to a rapid growth of both the CDO and CDS markets; for

example, at the end of 2001 there was $920 billion of CDSs outstanding and by the end of 2007 this had

grown to a staggering $62 trillion. Similarly the CDO market which was $275 billion in 2000 had grown to

$4.7)trillion by 2006. !e $aw in the formula was that it was used in a period when house prices rose rapidly,

and this led to extremely low default rates and also low correlations between defaults. However, if house price

rises turned to house price falls and default correlations were to rise rapidly then the CDO yields predicted

by the model were too low and CDS contracts seriously underpriced. To quote Kai Gilkes who worked for

10)years at the ratings agencies:

Everyone was pinning their hopes on house prices continuing to rise … When they stopped rising,

pretty much everyone was caught on the wrong side, because the sensitivity to house prices was huge.

And there was just no getting around it. Why didn't rating agencies build in some cushion for this

sensitivity to a house-price-depreciation scenario? Because if they had, they would have never rated a

single mortgage-backed CDO.

18.15 INCENTIVE STRUCTURES AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN THE BANKS

!e creation of new securities such as CDOs and CDSs and the boom in lending and house prices made

banking and the financial services industry very profitable. During the period 2000–2006 financial sector

earnings accounted for nearly 40% of the earnings of S&P 500 companies. As profits boomed so did the pay

packets of traders and top-level bankers. However, in retrospect it is clear that the level of risk being taken was

excessive and that the markets were underpricing the risks involved in the housing and construction boom.

!e rewards being generated during the good times meant that bankers and traders were more interested in

continuing the boom than monitoring the risks that were being accumulated in the system.

!ere were clearly problems with the incentive and reward structure of the banks, which were biased to

the generation of short-term profits and not the long-run viability of the banks. As many commentators have

pointed out, the annual system of bonuses in Wall Street and London meant that bankers and traders could

get large bonuses when times were good which would not be clawed back in bad times. Indeed, even in the

disastrous year of 2008 when banks were reporting unprecedented losses of over $500 billion and banking

share prices collapsed, Wall Street bankers received bonuses in excess of $70 billion. It seems that much of the

remuneration and bonus packages offered to investment bankers was dependent on revenues earned rather

than profits earned. With such a system, large bonuses were payable even if huge losses were being incurred. In

retrospect, it is clear that many of the profits reported during the 2002 to 2007 period were 'illusory profits' as

they were in fact the foundations for the massive losses reported once the credit crunch started (see Table)18.4).

It is also clear in retrospect that the banks' risk management systems were not up to the job. In particular,

banks lent too much money to people who were likely to default on their payments, placed too much faith in the

credit rating agencies' ratings of highly dangerous securities, and their risk management models underestimated

the risks they were taking. Most banks were using sophisticated Value at Risk modelling techniques to manage

their day-to-day risk exposure, but these models were deeply $awed by the assumptions they were making,

especially about house prices and the behaviour of macro variables. In addition, they were clearly not prepared

for the drying up of liquidity in the financial system, and failed to manage their counterparty exposures. !ere

can be little doubt that many more financial institutions would have been in)even greater di'culty if the

American government had not stepped in to make good the payments due from AIG.

18.16 THE RESPONSE TO THE CREDIT CRUNCH

When the credit crunch started on 9 August 2007, market participants and the authorities clearly failed to

understand the full extent of the crisis that was to ensue. Indeed, in June 2007 the Head of the Federal Reserve

Ben Bernanke made a speech arguing that subprime losses would be contained and limited to $100 billion. It

took more than a year – a time that saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG, the taking over of Fannie

Mae and Freddie Mac and a collapse in the prices of banking sector shares – for the full scale of the crisis to

become evident for all to see. In particular, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and takeover of AIG by the US

government showed the huge amount of counterparty risk that had built up in the system. While institutions

like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Citigroup and Bank of America were deemed to be 'too big to fail', the world's

largest insurer AIG was considered to be both 'too big and too interconnected' to fail. Although the financial

crisis started in August 2007 the effects on the real economy took some time to take a grip. It was really only

in the second half of 2008 that economic growth and international trade started to collapse and the full cost

to taxpayers of the financial bailout and economic recession became evident.

Due to fears of financial and economic collapse, the authorities in the USA and the UK in particular

responded with unprecedented action, with similar responses in countries such as China, Japan and Germany.

We shall divide our discussion of the o'cial policy response to the crisis into the following:

1. Cuts in o'cial short-term interest rates
2. Liquidity provision
3. Quantitative easing
4. Fiscal stimulus packages to stimulate the economy
O'cial bailouts of troubled financial institutions

6. Bank stress tests
7. Regulatory response
8. Fines

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

**Box 18.4 The bonus culture in banking: no rhyme or reason**

!e massive losses in American banks as a result of the subprime crisis led to an intense debate about

rewards in the financial services industry, and especially in banks where huge pay packages have been

awarded to CEOs and bank traders. Stories abound about individual pay packages, such as Hank

Paulson earning $700 million while working at Goldman Sachs, Charles Prince, the head of Citigroup,

earning over $30 million a year while the bank's share price collapsed, and in Britain Sir Fred Goodwin,

the CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, was granted a £700,000 per annum pension at the age of 50

despite his bank having racked up enormous losses.

!e extent of the bonus culture in the banking system was investigated by Andrew Cuomo, the

Attorney General of New York as a direct result of the financial crisis and his report was released in

August 2009. Entitled, _No Rhyme or Reason: Te Heads I Win, Tails You Lose Bonus Culture_, the report

is extremely critical of the bonus culture in banking. It argues that the bankers' claim that high pay is

related to high performance is spurious and that the link between pay and performance is in practice

virtually non-existent. !e report states:

In many ways, the past three years have provided a virtual laboratory in which to test the

hypothesis that compensation in the financial industry was performance-based. But even a

cursory examination of the data suggests that in these challenging economic times, compensation

for bank employees has become unmoored from the banks' financial performance.

!us, when the banks did well, their employees were paid well. When the banks did poorly,

their employees were paid well. And when the banks did very poorly, they were bailed out by

taxpayers and their employees were still paid well. Bonuses and overall compensation did not

vary significantly as profits diminished.

!e report looks at the 2008 bonuses and earnings at nine banks that received bailouts totalling

$55)billion. Two firms, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, suffered massive losses of more than $27 billion

each but nonetheless Citigroup paid out $5.33 billion in bonuses and Merrill paid $3.6 billion in

bonuses. So, despite losing a combined $54 billion, they still paid out nearly $9 billion in bonuses!

A)look at historical filings further supports the view that there is no link between pay and performance.

Pay increased greatly during the bull-market years of 2003 to 2006; for example, at Bank of America

gross pay increased from $10 billion to $18 billion but in 2008 remained at $18 billion despite huge

losses. A)similar pattern occurred at Citigroup where gross pay rose from $20 billion to $30 billion

during 2003–06 and remained at $30 billion in 2007 even though the firm ran into major financial

di'culties. At Merrill Lynch gross pay was nearly $16 billion in 2007 while losing $7 billion and was

still close to $15 billion in 2008 despite the bank facing collapse. Table 18.5 shows the bonus pools of the

first nine US banks to receive funds from the Trouble Asset Relief Programme (TARP). It shows each

bank’s earnings/losses, bonus pool, number of employees, earnings per employee, bonus per employee,

amount of TARP funds received and the amount of bonus payments in excess of $3 million, $2 million

and $1 million.

Cuomo's report concludes that:

In sum, as we seek to learn lessons from this economic crisis and repair the damage it has

wrought, it will be vital to develop and implement sound principles and rationales for executive

compensation and bonuses that promote sustainable and rational economic growth. !e repeated

explanation from bank executives that bonuses are tied to performance in a manner designed

to promote such growth does not appear to be accurate. Indeed, our investigation suggests a

disconnect between compensation and bank performance that resulted in a 'heads I win, tails you

lose' bonus system. In other words, bank compensation structures lacked consistent principles

and tended to result in a compensation system that was all 'upside'.

18.17 CUTS IN OFFICIAL SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES

In the first instance, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England made a series of interest-rate cuts that led

to record low short-term interest rates in the two economies. !e Federal Reserve reduced the Federal Funds

rate from 5.25% in June 2007 to a record low target range of 0 to 0.25% in December 2008, while the Bank of

England cut its rate from 5.25% in July 2007 to a mere 0.5% in March 2009.

!e interest-rate cuts seem to have had three roles:

i.

to reduce the interest payments of heavily indebted consumers and firms, which was especially

important in helping those with variable rate mortgages to continue to service their mortgage

payments;

ii.

to increase banks' profit margins which are positively related to the spread between short-term and

longer-term rates of interest;

iii. to stimulate consumer expenditure and economic activity.

!e cuts in short-term interest rates, particularly a(er the collapse of Lehman Brothers, were unprecedented

in size – the **UK base rate** - f 0.5% was the lowest in the history of the Bank of England which had started

- perations in 1694, and the indicative range of 0–0.25% of the Federal Reserve was its lowest ever **Federal**
**Funds rate** (see Table 18.6).

18.18 LIQUIDITY PROVISION

As the financial markets froze, many banks found it very di'cult to raise money by issuing short-term

commercial paper, to borrow from other banks on the interbank markets or even to find buyers for some of

their assets. !e shortage of liquidity was exacerbated by the phenomenon of 'liquidity hoarding' whereby

banks decided to hoard whatever liquidity they had to ensure they could see themselves through the crisis.

So central banks stepped in to buy many of the securities that banks and other financial intermediaries were

attempting to sell. !is was in some ways merely fulfilling their traditional duty as 'lender of the last resort',

but the sheer size of the liquidity injections was unprecedented in scale. Also, the central banks increased the

maturity of the lending and the range of assets that they were prepared to accept as collateral for providing

liquidity. For instance, the US Treasury in September and December 2007 increased the term of loans it

allowed through its discount window and in March 2008 agreed to accept less liquid securities such as MBSs

as collateral for loans. Following the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 the US Treasury created a primary

dealer credit facility so that **primary dealers** could gain access to Federal Reserve facilities. In addition, the

Federal Reserve set up a temporary arrangement to ensure unlimited liquidity for Fannie Mae and Freddie

Mac if required.

495

International Finance

In April 2008 the Bank of England introduced a Special Liquidity Scheme (SLS) for eligible financial

institutions to swap less liquid securities for UK Treasury bills. !e SLS was extensively used in its nine-month

existence – to the tune of £185 billion. In May 2008 the Bank of England raised the ceiling on the deposits

that banks were allowed to hold at the Bank of England from 1% of sterling eligible liabilities or £1 billion,

whichever was higher, to 2.5% of eligible liabilities or £5 billion – more than doubling the amount lenders could

hold on deposit at the Bank of England. Lenders use the facility because it provides them with risk-free interest,

at the same time as giving them instant access to the funds. In the USA, on 18 September 2008, following the

bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the rescue of AIG, the Federal Reserve agreed to a $180 billion expansion

- f its temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the Bank of Canada, Swiss National Bank,
Bank of England, Bank of Japan and European Central Bank. !is increased capacity, ensuring that these
central banks would have su'cient dollar funding for both short-term and overnight operations.

In sum, central banks increased liquidity by providing large increases in the funds they provided, by

extending the maturity of their credit operations, significantly expanding the range of eligible collateral as

well as the list of counterparties to include broker-dealers and special swap facilities allowing participants

to temporarily swap their high quality mortgage-backed and other securities for highly liquid government

bills and bonds. Finally, an increase in swap lines between central banks ensured that central banks and their

counterparties had su'cient access to foreign currency liquidity.

18.19 QUANTITATIVE EASING

Traditionally, central banks intervene through open market operations to in$uence short-term interest rates,

as outlined earlier. During the credit crunch short-term interest rates reached record lows. However, during

the crisis they also became concerned about the relatively elevated levels of long-term interest rates facing

corporations, and thus engaged in a new practice of 'credit easing' as it was called in the USA, or **quantitative**

**easing** as it was called in the UK. !e basic idea of quantitative easing was to purchase existing government

and even corporate/mortgage backed bonds from financial institutions and market participants with the hope

- f raising their prices and thereby lowering the yields on such assets. Another motive of quantitative easing
was to avert the risk of de$ation; that is, a period of falling consumer prices as a result of excess capacity
and rising unemployment rates that were occurring in the real economy as a result of the crisis. Finally,
another hope of quantitative easing was that the increased cash holdings of the banks would encourage them
to increase lending to consumers and businesses, so easing the effects of the credit crunch.

An important aspect of the quantitative easing policy is the expectation that purchases of longer-term

securities would be accompanied by an increase in the monetary base and a lowering of longer-term interest

rates, as the additional demand for the longer-term securities raised their prices and thus lowered their yield.

However, since quantitative easing effectively involves the printing of new money it also brings with it the

potential to raise in$ation expectations and in$ation risk premiums, so that in the mediumto long-term it

could actually raise longer-term yields rather than lower them. !e in$ationary dangers of quantitative easing

ultimately depend on the amount of quantitative easing and whether it creates a permanent or temporary

increase in the monetary base. In the UK the Bank of England set aside £375 billion for quantitative easing, and

in the USA some $3,800 billion was set aside for asset purchases under its QE1, QEII and QEIII programmes.

When the European Central Bank announced in May 2009 that it would undertake a policy of credit easing to

the tune of &60 billion of covered euro bonds (mostly backed by mortgage repayments), the ECB subsequently

undertook further asset purchase as a result of the so-called PIIGS eurozone crisis. Japan also announced

an unprecedented quantitative easing program of its own in April 2013 in a bid to kick-start in$ation in its

monetary base over a less than two-year period.

Since these initial rounds of quantitative easing there have been continued instances of further quantitative

easing caused by the Covid-19 crisis which started to unsettle financial markets in March 2020. !e response

- f many governments including the USA and UK was to finance further massive increases in their fiscal
deficits through further asset purchases of central banks. !e European Central Bank also pursued a
vigorous quantitative easing programme in response to the crisis leading to a further rapid expansion of
its own balance sheet. Figure 18.3 shows how the balance sheet of these three central banks have expanded

since 2007.

18.20 FISCAL STIMULUS

Another response involved the extensive use of fiscal stimulus packages to try to cushion the effects of the

credit crunch on the real economy. In the USA a combination of economic stimulus packages increased

government expenditure and tax concessions, which resulted in a rise in the fiscal deficit from 2.1% of GDP in

2007 to 13.6% of GDP in 2009. Initially, under President Bush, the economic stimulus package was relatively

muted. In February 2008 a $168 billion economic stimulus package was announced, consisting mainly of tax

cuts and rebates.

497

International Finance

On 10 February 2009 the Obama administration passed a $789 billion economic ‘recovery package’ made

up of $502 billion of expenditure and $287 billion of tax relief, with a plan to spend 70% of it within the

first two years. !ere was a noticeable change in the stimulus packages offered by the two administrations.

!e initial Bush plan based on tax cuts was not deemed to be a great success because much of the tax

cuts and rebates were just saved or used to pay down debt rather than increase expenditure. As a result,

President Obama’s much larger stimulus package aimed to directly boost aggregate demand through

government expenditure on infrastructure. On 9 November 2009 China announced a $586 billion stimulus

package equivalent to nearly 15% of its GDP. Even the European Union agreed a &200 billion package,

which was around 1.5% of its GDP, on 12 January 2009. On 24 November 2008 the UK announced a £25.6

billion stimulus plan, including a temporary cut in value-added tax (VAT) from 18.5% to 15%. Germany

announced a &31 billion stimulus package in November 2008, followed by a &50 billion plan in February

2009; while Japan presented a $50)billion stimulus package in October 2008 and a further $150 billion

package in April 2009.

!e net result of the bank bailout packages, economic recession and economic stimulus packages was a

massive increase in the actual and projected fiscal deficits and corresponding increases in the national debt,

especially in countries like the USA and the UK. Table 18.7 shows the actual fiscal deficits and the rising

national debt for the USA, UK, Japan and Germany for 2007–10.

18.21 BAILOUTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

_The US response_

Although the economic stimulus packages were among the biggest ever undertaken, their scale was

dwarfed by the amount of funds used to bail out the financial sector through capital injections and

guarantees. !e US set the ball rolling when a $700 billion **Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)** was

passed, allowing the US Treasury to buy up or insure up to $700 billion of troubled assets (primarily

residential and commercial mortgage-related securities issued prior to 14 March 2008) from the banking

and financial sector. !e aim was to provide some liquidity and pricing to these securities, which had

proved very di'cult to trade following the onset of the crisis. Any bank selling securities to the TARP was

expected to grant the government warrants, equity or senior debt to the Treasury, giving the taxpayer some

potential upside should the bank's shares recover. !e first $350 billion was released on 3 October 2008

and the second instalment of $350 billion on 15 January 2009. On 14 October 2008 there was a change

in the TARP, enabling the Treasury to buy senior preferred shares and warrants in the banks under a

Capital Partnership Programme (CPP). Subsequent changes to the TARP permitted the funds to be used to

enhance consumer credit and mitigate the financial crisis more generally, thus enabling TARP funds to be

allocated to bailing out the big three car makers, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. In February 2009 the

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced that $50 billion of TARP funds would be used to mitigate

mortgage foreclosures.

On 25 November 2008 the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) was announced by the

Federal Reserve, enabling financial institutions to borrow funds to purchase distressed securities. Under the

scheme some $200 billion (later changed to $1 trillion) of funds was made available to holders of certain

AAA-rated ABSs on a non-recourse basis. A non-recourse loan is a loan secured against collateral but for

which the borrower is not responsible if he defaults; the lender can seize the collateral but he cannot chase

the borrower if the collateral is insu'cient to cover the value of the loan. !e idea of the TALF was to

inject liquidity into the ABS market, which was viewed as important in financing consumer credit and small

business loans.

On 23 March 2009 a Public-Private Investment Program (P-PIP) was established to use $75–$100 billion

- f TARP funds to buy troubled legacy loans and securities in conjunction with the private sector. !e
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would make non-recourse loan guarantees for up to 85% of the
purchase price, effectively limiting private market participants' possible loss to 15% of the price paid for
the securities. It was envisaged that the P-PIP would lead to the purchase of some $500 billion of troubled
assets in total.

Another part of the policy response was the takeover or purchase of stakes in some of America's bestknown financial institutions. In particular, the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which

had combined assets totalling $5.5 trillion on 7 September 2008, was pivotal, and merely a confirmation of

the widely held view that they were too big to fail. !e government’s takeover of AIG on 16 September 2008

due to losses on its CDSs was instigated because AIG was deemed both too big and too complex to be allowed

to fail on top of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. !e bailout of AIG totalled over $180 billion, and was also

important because the government made good on $93 billion of CDS contracts that it had entered into with

Goldman Sachs ($12.9 billion), Société Générale ($11.9 billion), Deutsche Bank ($11.8 billion) and Barclays

($8.5 billion). If the US Treasury had not honoured those contracts then these institutions would have been

in much greater di'culty.

18.22 BANK STRESS TESTS

Following the Lehman Brothers' collapse in August 2008, governments decided that the way forward to

reassure investors and market participants was that banks would be subject to stress tests by their regulators.

In February 2009 the US government announced that the 19 largest US banks would be subject to 'stress tests'

by the Federal Reserve to see if they could survive a 'worst case scenario' consisting of 8.9% unemployment

in 2009 rising to 10.3% by 2010, a further 22% fall in property prices and a fall in real GDP of 3.2% in 2009

with only 0.5% growth in 2010. !e results of the stress tests were announced on 7 May 2009, with 10 of the

19 banks being required to raise $74.9 billion of new capital by November 2009. In the event of a failure to

raise the capital then the banks would get the required capital from the US government in return for equity

stakes. It was made clear to market participants before the tests that further bank failures among the top 19

would not be permitted.

!e basic idea behind a stress test is to see if a bank has enough capital to survive a range of pre-specified

unfavourable economic scenarios (such as a prolonged recession) and other adverse developments (such as a

collapse in house prices or a large fall in equities and/or bond prices). !e aim of stress tests is both to assure

investors in banks that the bank is not at risk of failure and also to encourage or require banks to set aside

enough capital and/or raise new capital and/or change their business operations so as to ensure that they can

survive in di'cult times. !e results of stress tests have implications _inter alia_ for capital raising, management

- f bank assets, distribution of dividends, bonuses and pay and whether to take more or less risk in their
business operations.

Prior to the financial crisis banks had done stress tests on themselves but mainly as part of their internal

risk management based management (IRBM). However, following the financial crisis, regulators in the US,

UK and Europe have since moved to a regime of annual stress tests for major banks under their jurisdiction.

Banking regulators use the results of tests as a tool to spot potential systemic risk and to assess which banks

have su'cient capital to survive a financial crisis and which are likely to be most at risk were a crisis to occur.

Since October 2012 the US regulators have required American banks to undergo stress tests twice per

year – one internal and one conducted by the regulators. !ese annual tests are part of the Comprehensive

Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) which post-2010 are applicable to all US based banks with more than

$50 billion in assets. !e tests are carried out by the Federal Reserve. In its June 2016 tests on 33 banks

covering 80% of US banking assets, all passed without censure except Morgan Stanley and the US subsidiaries

- f Santander and Deutsche Bank. !ose banks passing the stress test are able to pay dividends and buy back
stock from their shareholders. !e Federal Reserve stated in a press release of 23 June 2016:

!e most severe hypothetical scenario projects that loan losses at the 33 participating bank holding

companies would total $385 billion during the nine quarters tested. !e 'severely adverse' scenario

features a severe global recession with the domestic unemployment rate rising five percentage points,

accompanied by a heightened period of financial stress, and negative yields for short-term U.S. Treasury

securities.

!e report noted that the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, which compares high-quality capital

to risk-weighted assets, would fall from an actual 12.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to a minimum level of

8.4% in the hypothetical adverse stress scenario.

In the case of the UK, the stress tests are carried out by the Prudential Regulation Authority which is a

part of the Bank of England in conjunction with the Financial Policy Committee which was formed in April

500

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

2013. In its November 2015 report covering seven major UK banks, it found that based on their balance
sheets at end-2014, five of the banks (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society
and Santander UK) were fine but the Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered needed to boost their
capital adequacy ratios.

In the case of the EU, stress tests are coordinated by the European Banking Association in cooperation

with the European Systemic Risk Board, the European Commission and relevant national authorities. Its July

2016 review of 51 European banks from 15 countries was different than previous reviews, since rather than

apply simple pass–fail criteria, it reported that the process would instead inform supervisors' ongoing review

- f banks and guide their efforts to maintain capital in the system and support the ongoing repair of balance
sheets. !e test revealed that the EU banking sector had significantly shored up its capital base with Core
Equity Tier 1 capital position for the stress test sample of 13.2% at the end-2015, some 2% higher than in 2014
and 4% higher than in 2011. In the European case, it should be noted that the tests were criticized)for)excluding
both Greek and Portuguese banks from the process and also failing to give a pass or fail to each bank.

Criticisms of stress tests include their failure to incorporate major possible events such as sovereign defaults

- r the emergence of negative interest rates for a sustained period of time which threaten bank profitability.
!ere is also the risk that banks will game the stress tests so they are able to survive the stress scenarios
presented to them by their regulators but not other crises that could easily occur. To some extent this problem
can be overcome by changing the adverse scenario each test time. !ere are also large costs for banks involved
in stress tests which are resource-intensive exercises involving extensive senior management and board-level

engagement.

18.23 REGULATORY RESPONSE

Not surprisingly given the extent of the financial crisis, the bailout costs to the taxpayer and impact on

governments' fiscal deficits and national debts and a strong desire to prevent future crises, there was a strong

regulatory response to the financial crisis at both the national and international level.

At the international level the Bank of International Settlements set up a Financial Stability Board in April

2009 to start the process of formulating Basel III to replace the Basel II Accord which had clearly failed to

prevent the financial crisis. !e main elements of Basel III are increased capital requirements, a new liquidity

ratio and greater reserves being required from Structurally Important Financial Institutions. In the UK the

Financial Services Authority which had been regulating the banking sector since 1998 was disbanded and its

regulatory function returned to the Bank of England. !e US Congress also enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in July 2010 which is the most comprehensive regulatory reform

- f the banking sector since the 1930s – see Box 18.5.

**Box 18.5 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act**

In response to the financial crisis and a desire to reduce the risk of a future financial crisis, congress

passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in July 2010. It was named

a(er its sponsors Christopher Dodd and Barney Frank and totalling some 2,300 pages it is by far the

most extensive set of regulatory reforms. !e Act established a number of new government agencies

tasked with implementing the act and overseeing the banking sector. !e aims of the act were

501

International Finance

(i))to)make)the)financial system more transparent and less risky and more accountable; (ii) to prevent

financial institutions from becoming 'too big to fail'; (iii) to protect consumers from risky behaviour,

abuse and losses from financial institutions; (iv) to end costly government bailouts of financial

institutions; and (v) to end risky and abusive financial practices by brokers and financial institutions.

!e Act established a number)of new government agencies tasked with implementing the Act and

  - verseeing the banking)sector.

!e Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA)

were set up to monitor the financial stability of major banks and to provide for firm liquidations or

restructuring through an Orderly Liquidation Fund (OLF). !e FSOC also has powers to break up

large banks that are deemed to pose systemic risks or require them to hold larger reserves. !e OLF

provides funds to assist with the restructuring and dismantling of financial companies that have been

placed into receivership and prohibits the use of taxpayer money for such purposes. In the light of the

failure of AIG, a Federal Insurance O'ce was set up to monitor large insurance companies that were

deemed 'too big to fail'.

!e Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was set up to crack down on predatory lending

and to ensure consumers better understood the terms of a mortgage loan before taking out a mortgage.

It restricts the commissions that can be earned by mortgage brokers on higher fee and/or interest rate

mortgages. It also prevents mortgage originators from steering potential borrowers to the loan that

will result in a higher fee payment for the originators. !e CPFB also has powers over other types of

consumer lending such as credit and debit cards requiring information given to consumers to be easy

to understand and charges made clear.

!e SEC O'ce of Credit Ratings was also set up to oversee the credit rating agencies that were

viewed as contributing to the financial crisis by having given unduly favourable ratings to mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations. !e role of the O'ce is to ensure that the ratings

agencies improve the accuracy of their ratings of the various business and securities that they evaluate.

A key element of the Dodd-Frank Act is the so-called 'Volker rule' (Article VI) which restricts the

ways commercial banks can invest and severely limits their ability to do proprietary trading. It also

makes it far harder for deposit accepting institutions such as commercial banks to conduct speculative

trading positions. In addition, there are heavy restrictions on their dealings with and exposure to risktaking market players such as hedge funds and private equity. !e effect of the Volker rule is to restore

the distinction between commercial banks and investment banks, making it far harder for financial

institutions to use their commercial banking deposit base to finance the speculative activities of their

investment banks. !e Volker rule also regulates financial firms' use of derivatives so as to reduce the

risk of a large financial institution taking large positions that could endanger the financial system.

!e Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions relating to derivatives, especially in relation to the

Credit Default Swap market. Since the CDS market is primarily an OTC market, the massive growth of

the market and the counterparty risk shown by the failure of AIG led to the Dodd-Frank Act requiring

the setting up of centralized exchanges for swaps trading and to improve information and transparency

with the aim of reducing the risk of counterparty default. !e Dodd-Frank Act also made it easier and

financially rewarding for whistleblowers to expose wrongdoing by financial institutions with a bounty

programme under which whistleblowers could receive 10% to 30% of the proceeds from a litigation

settlement. It increased from 90 to 180 days the statute of limitations under which a whistleblower can

bring forward a claim against an employer.

502

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

While the Dodd-Frank Act deals with many key issues resulting from the financial crisis, it is not

without criticism. One is the huge regulatory costs involved in implementing 225 new rules across a total

  - f 11 Federal agencies, but compared to the overall cost of the financial crisis these costs are somewhat
small. !ere is some concern that the Act, by limiting banks' ability to take speculative and marketmaking trading positions in securities such as government bonds, will mean a drying up of liquidity.
!is increases the chances of more abrupt price movements, making it di'cult for institutions to do
large trades in securities during periods of financial stress. !e higher reserve requirement on banks
and financial institutions will also restrict their ability to lend money to the private sector which will
additionally hit investment and economic growth. Some commentators argue that the over-regulation

  - f the American financial system will put their financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage
vis-à-vis their international competitors.

18.24 THE UK RESPONSE

!e UK's response to the financial crisis was initially much tougher than that of the USA. !e first institution

requiring a bailout was Northern Rock, which in September 2007 was facing a bank run. !e government

initially failed to make any guarantee to protect depositors beyond the statutory commitment to protect the

first £20,000. However, as queues formed outside bank branches, the Bank of England was forced to step

in as lender of last resort and guarantee all Northern Rock deposits. Eventually, in February 2008, when it

became clear that Northern Rock was unable to refinance itself, the bank was nationalized and its shares

became worthless. Another nationalization took place on 28 September 2008 when the government took over

Bradford & Bingley's £50 billion mortgage and loan book and sold off its branch network to Spanish banking

group Santander.

!e full extent of the crisis in British banking really became apparent when the government was forced

to bail out the largest bank in the UK, the Royal Bank of Scotland (which included the well-known NatWest

franchise), and the newly merged Lloyds TSB and HBOS banks. On 8 October 2008, in what Robert Peston,

the BBC business editor, characterized as 'perhaps the most extraordinary day in British banking history',

the UK government announced an unprecedented £500 billion bank rescue scheme. !e main aims of the

scheme were to restore market confidence and to stabilize the British banking system. !e package provided

for £200 billion of short-term loans through the Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme, £250 billion of

government guarantees on interbank lending and up to £50 billion of state investment in the UK banking

sector. Two major banks took part in the Bank Recapitalisation Fund scheme, the Royal Bank of Scotland

(RBS) and Lloyds TSB with its new acquisition, HBOS. RBS took £20 billion with £5 billion in preference

shares and £15 billion in ordinary shares, giving the government a 60% holding, while Lloyds TSB-HBOS took

£17 billion with £8.5 billion in preference shares and £8.5 billion in ordinary shares, giving the government a

40% holding. On 6 March 2009, a(er it became clear that the HBOS losses were far bigger than expected, the

British government announced a further injection which increased its stake in Lloyds TSB to 65%, or 77%

including non-voting preference shares.

Despite its huge scale, the October 2008 bailout was not su'cient to stabilize the British banking system

- r the UK financial markets. !erefore, on 19 January 2009 the government announced a second bank rescue
package designed to increase the ability of British banks to lend to business and their customers. !e January
package was made up of an initial £50 billion of funds which were available for large corporates and an Asset

503

International Finance

Protection Scheme (APS), an insurance scheme designed to limit participating UK banks' future losses on

their 'toxic assets'. On 26 February 2008 the basic idea of the scheme was announced by the UK Treasury. In

return for an insurance premium, participating banks would be able to insure a large part of their loan books

against future losses. RBS announced its intention to participate in the scheme in respect of £325 billion

- f assets, paying a participation fee of £6.5 billion (in the form of B shares giving the Treasury the right to
dividends but not voting rights) to the Treasury in capital and agreeing to bear a first loss of up to £19.5 billion.
As part of the deal RBS agreed to make 2009 lending commitments totalling £25 billion comprising £9 billion

- f mortgage lending and £16 billion of business lending. For its part the UK Treasury made a capital injection
- f £13 billion into RBS and made a commitment to subscribe for an additional £6 billion at RBS's option. !e
- ther major participant was Lloyds-HBOS, which on 27 March 2009 announced an agreement with the UK
Treasury to place £260 billion of assets into the APS for a participation fee of £15.6 billion with the bank being
responsible for a first loss of £25 billion. As part of the deal Lloyds-HBOS agreed to make additional lending
commitments totalling £14 billion over the following year comprising £3 billion of mortgage lending and
£11)billion of business lending.

**Box 18.5 The nationalizations of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley**

!e concept of nationalization was becoming a distant memory for many British citizens, with some of

the last major nationalizations being the car company British Leyland in 1976 and the Bank of England

rescue of Johnson Matthey Bank in 1984. An even more distant event was a bank run – one had not

  - occurred in Britain since 1866. However, the credit crunch reintroduced the British public to both
concepts with the nationalizations of its third largest mortgage lender Northern Rock (6,000 employees)
in February 2008, followed by its eighth largest mortgage provider Bradford & Bingley (3,200 employees)
in October 2008.

!e reasons for the problems at Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley were somewhat different

from subprime mortgage losses that created havoc with the US banking system. !e seeds for the demise

  - f the two institutions dated back to legislation, passed by the !atcher government in 1986, enabling
building societies to become banks. Northern Rock took advantage of the legislation in October 1997
and Bradford & Bingley in December 2000. !e principal problem for both companies was the funding
mechanism that they used to finance the expansion of their mortgage books. Traditionally, banks and
building societies funded their mortgage books by using their customers' deposits. However, with
their new-found bank status, both organizations borrowed money, quite a lot of it short-term from
international financial markets, to supplement their deposit-based funding in order to aggressively
grow their mortgage businesses. !e business model was badly disrupted by the subprime crisis when
interbank lending dried up and the banks could not roll over their short-term paper as the credit markets
froze. Both banks also made the mistake of increasing their mortgage business by aggressively lending
high amounts of mortgage compared to property values, o(en requiring little or even no deposit from
borrowers. Bradford & Bingley was particularly aggressive in lending to landlords in the 'buy-to-let'
market, o(en requiring only self-certification of their income.

A bank run on the Northern Rock bank started on 14 September 2007 a(er the bank announced that

it was seeking emergency assistance from the Bank of England. !is sparked queues of its customers to

form outside its branches and three days later the Bank of England, afraid that other banks might face a

bank run, decided to step in to guarantee all deposits at the bank. During the next few months)Northern

504

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

Rock's share price continued to fall and attempts to find a private buyer failed. On 22 February 2008

Northern Rock was nationalized. Bradford & Bingley became increasingly exposed as speculators

realized that its funding model was similar to that of Northern Rock. Despite initial denials that it needed

new capital, the bank was forced to raise £400 million in June 2008. However, this was not su'cient to

restore confidence in the bank and it was nationalized on 29 September 2008 a(er customers started to

queue to withdraw their money and it became clear it could not roll over its short-term debt. Bradford

& Bingley's mortgage business was taken over by the government and its branches and deposits were

taken over by the Spanish bank, Santander Group.

!e nationalization of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley required Acts of Parliament, as

well as permission from the European Commission whose competition rules generally forbid direct

state support for a company. As a result of the nationalizations the British government injected

£25)billion)into)Northern Rock and £8.2 billion into Bradford & Bingley. !e nationalizations meant

the government had a mortgage book exposure totalling £140 billion (£90 billion from Northern Rock

and £50 billion from Bradford & Bingley) at the end of 2008. !e investment in Northern Rock and

Bradford and Bingley was managed by UK Financial Investments (UKFI) which itself ceased trading on

31 March 2018, with its assets transferred to UK Government Investments, a limited company wholly

  - wned by HM Treasury.

_Other countries' responses_

While US and UK banks were the most heavily affected by the credit crunch, the crisis had severe impacts on

- ther countries' banking systems. German banks had bought US subprime-related securities and were heavily
impacted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but had also overlent to Eastern Europe. On 6 October 2008,
the German government was forced to step in with a &50 billion rescue of Hypo Real Estate (HRE), taking a
90% stake in return for its capital injection. HRE's viability was threatened when its Irish-based subsidiary
bank Depfra faced severe funding problems following the Lehman Brothers collapse. As it became apparent
that more German banks were facing problems, on 17 October 2008 the German government announced
a &500 billion Special Fund for Financial Market Stabilization, with $400 billion available for guaranteeing
interbank loans, $80 billion available for capital injections and &20 billion set aside to cover potential losses.
In January 2009 the German government also set aside &100 billion for guarantees and loans to assist German
companies adversely affected by the recession.

On 27 September 2008, Fortis, a European banking and insurance group, was rescued through a partnationalization, surrendering a 49% stake in return for a capital injection of &11.2 billion from the central

banks of Belgium (&4.7 billion), Netherlands (&4 billion) and Luxembourg (&2.5 billion). !e bank had made

major losses through taking a &24 billion stake in the Dutch bank ABN Amro, which had huge losses on its

books following its subprime exposures. A few days later on 30 September 2008 Dexia Bank was rescued by

the Belgian, Dutch and French governments with a &6.4 billion package. Another country drawn, perhaps

inevitably, into the crisis given its well-established banking sector was Switzerland. !e Swiss banking

sector had a reputation for conservative banking principles and secrecy. However, it seems that during the

boom years its two largest investment banks, the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and Credit Suisse, had

departed from this tradition of cautious money management. In particular, UBS under former Chairman

505

International Finance

Marcel Ospel had set itself the goal of becoming the world's number one investment bank. In so doing it had

abandoned its traditionally conservative strategies to leap into US subprime-backed investments and other

high-risk instruments. In particular, its hedge fund Dillon Read Capital had built up a large exposure to the

US subprime mortgage sector. As credit-related losses mounted to over $40 billion and worried depositors

withdrew tens of billions of dollars from the bank, on 17 October the Swiss National Bank (SNB) stepped

in with a $59.2 billion rescue package made up of a $5.3 billion capital injection and a commitment to buy

$53.9 billion of UBS securities and assets to be transferred to a separate entity controlled by the SNB. Credit

Suisse decided to seek capital from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Qatar Investment Authority which injected

$8.75 billion of capital.

Two of the more surprising countries to be heavily drawn into the crisis were Ireland and Iceland. !e

Irish economy had boomed for many years and property prices had risen more dramatically in Ireland than

in any other country. !e trouble was that the Irish banks became heavily exposed to the property market and

property developers, so that when house prices began to fall the Irish economy went into a steep recession.

On 2 October 2008 following a run by depositors, the Irish government announced that it would protect all

deposits in its six largest banks, a protection guarantee in the region of &400 billion. In December the Irish

government announced that it would pump &7.7 billion into three of its largest banks, taking control of Anglo

Irish Banking group with a 75% stake. In the end even that proved insu'cient to save Anglo Irish Bank which

was nationalized in January 2009. In April 2009 the IMF estimated that the Irish bank bailouts would be

equivalent to 13.9% of Ireland's GDP, or &24 billion.

In the case of Iceland, a small country with a mere 300,000 population, its banks had grown dramatically

since 2000 and had combined assets equivalent to eight times its GDP. !e massive expansion of its banks

was financed by borrowing in foreign currencies, so when the Icelandic crown started to collapse the

viability of its banks became questionable. In late September 2008 the Icelandic government took a 75%

controlling interest in its third largest bank Glitner, with a &600 million capital injection, as it became clear

the bank was on the brink of collapse. In October 2008 it was forced to step in and rescue three of its largest

banks. One of its banks, Icesave, a subsidiary of Landsbanki, had attracted significant deposits of up to

£5)billion from the UK. When its accounts were frozen there were major problems for British companies,

local authorities and individual depositors that held accounts with Icesave. In the end Iceland had to go

to the IMF for an emergency $2.1 billion loan, with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark lending an

additional $2.5 billion.

18.25 FINES

A final aspect of dealing with the credit crunch was fines for financial institutions involved in bringing

about the crisis in the first place. !e objective of the fines was partly to punish the financial institutions

for mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities and CDOs by deliberately understating the risks involved, to

raise money for taxpayers and the regulators that incurred costs investigating the crisis, to encourage future

better behaviour on the part of financial institutions and also to provide some consumer relief for financial

institutions and investors that bought the mis-sold securities.

!e US Department of Justice (DoJ) reached out-of-court settlements in relation to the mis-selling of

mortgage-backed securities totalling over $70 billion by December 2016. !e largest fine was imposed on

Bank of America ($16.65 billion), JP Morgan Chase ($13 billion), Deutsche Bank ($7.2 billion), Citigroup

($7)billion), Credit Suisse ($5.28 billion), Goldman Sachs ($5.1 billion), Morgan Stanley ($3.6 billion), Wells

**Box 18.6 The total global cost of the credit crunch**

!e total costs of the credit crunch are impossible to calculate since we need to also know what would

have happened if there had not been a credit crunch. Furthermore, the boom that preceded the credit

crunch meant higher employment and higher tax revenues for governments that to some extent helped

to offset the lower levels of employment and tax revenues that followed the onset of the credit crunch. In

its April 2009 report the IMF estimated that banks faced $2.5 trillion in losses between 2007 and 2010,

insurers $300 billion and other financial institutions $1.3 trillion, a total of $4.1 trillion.

In July 2009 the IMF put the cost of government support packages at over $10 trillion, with

rich countries providing $9.2 trillion of support for the financial sector and emerging economies

$1.6)trillion.)Of this, some $1.9 trillion is upfront costs and the remainder is made up of guarantees and

loans. !e financial bailout costs include:

|Capitalinjections|$11trillion<br>.|
|---|---|
|Purchase of assets|$1.9 trillion|
|Guarantees|$4.6 trillion|
|Liquidity provision|$2.5 trillion|

!e fiscal and financial costs of the policy response to the credit crunch are given in Table 18.8.

Fargo ($1.2 billion) with Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland deciding not to settle with the DoJ and

argue their case in the US court system. !e size of the fines re$ected the seriousness of the financial crisis

and scale of mis-selling of securities. Although banks usually pay the fines over a prolonged period of time the

size of the settlements has eroded their capital bases meaning the need to raise new capital, sell off some assets

and restricting their ability to pay dividends to their shareholders and lend new funds to potential borrowers.

Against this the sheer scale of the financial crisis, the hit to government finances and the misery caused to

millions of homeowners and the rise in unemployment need to be considered.

18.26 THE COVID-19 CRISIS AND THE IMPACT ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE

GLOBAL ECONOMY

In 2019 the global economy was well into the recovery phases of the global financial crisis and European

economies seemed to have overcome the problems of the PIIGS crisis. Unemployment rates were at record

lows in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the IMF was forecasting global economic growth of

4% for 2020. However, the biggest shock since the Second World War was about to hit the global economy.

A mysterious virus believed to have its origins in a market based in the Chinese city of Wuhan was initially

downplayed as a major threat by both the Chinese government and the World Health Organisation. However,

during January and February 2020 evidence emerged that the virus was potentially lethal and highly

transmissible from person to person and had started to spread across the world at an exponential rate. As

evidence emerged of the rapid spread of the virus and rising hospital admissions, followed by a noticeable

increase in deaths, the WHO declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.

!e reaction of the financial markets was rather swi( and there was a sharp fall in global equities across the

globe. As evidence about the highly transmissible nature of Covid-19 and its potential to overwhelm countries'

health care systems emerged, governments were forced to respond by instigating significant lockdowns of

their economies. !is meant the temporary closure of restaurants, hotels, sports events and non-essential

retail, and major disruption to the airline industry with $ight tra'c down by over 90% in some countries with

large restrictions on international travel. With rapidly rising unemployment and fear of a global depression

the response of governments and central banks was swi( and unprecedented in scale. Governments across

Europe introduced furlough schemes to support millions of employees who were not able to work, and there

was direct and indirect aid to business in the form of direct state aid, tax concessions and business loans to help

see them through the pandemic. !e scale of the state intervention was unprecedented in the post-Second

World War era and meant both a huge increase in fiscal deficits and national debts in almost all economies.

!ere was an equally unprecedented response to the crisis from central banks with the Federal Reserve, Bank

- f England and European Central Bank engaging in further significant quantitative easing programmes to buy
the newly issued government debt, effectively monetizing most of the massive increase in fiscal expenditures.

!e result of the policies was to limit the immediate damage to the real economies and households but

there were nonetheless still very substantial falls in GDP and very large increases in fiscal deficits and national

debts as shown in Table 18.9. !e policies also had the effect of $ooding the financial markets leading to a

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

rapid recovery in global stock markets fuelled by record low interest rates and increased liquidity. Although

real GDPs fell substantially in many economies the US stock market actually rose year on year.

At the time of writing, infection rates were being brought under control and vaccines being deployed

which will help to bring an eventual end to the health crisis. Nonetheless, the roll-out of the vaccination

programme will be speedier in some countries than in others, making recovery from the Covid-19 crisis

uneven across countries and regions of the world. !ere can be no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has

been the largest global health and economic crisis since the Second World War and it will take many years

before the full economic and financial effects of the crisis become clear. !e fiscal and monetary implications

will weigh on economies for many years to come with no doubt some economies recovering more quickly

than others. !e increase in national debts, while a necessary response to the crisis, will need to be brought

under control over time by a mixture of government spending cuts and tax rises particularly on corporations

and wealthier taxpayers simply because the poorer sections of society have been most adversely affected by the

crisis and they have also been the most severely affected by job losses and ill-health. Whether Covid-19 will

sow the seeds of a future financial crisis remains to be seen; it has certainly reduced the room for manoeuvre

for governments should a future crisis emerge.

18.27 CONCLUSIONS

!e global financial crisis has many lessons for regulators, financial market participants, policy-makers and

financial institutions. More than a decade on, we now have a fuller understanding of the causes of the crisis and

lessons to be learnt but it will still take many years before we can properly assess the longer-term consequences

and appropriateness of the policy response. At the heart of the crisis was an unprecedented increase in debt

levels of the private sector, misunderstood, mis-sold, mispriced and mis-rated financial innovations, a housing

bubble and inadequate management of risk by banks, along with regulation that was too lax. !e credit rating

agencies also played a pivotal role because, had CDOs and MBSs been properly rated, there would have been

far less build-up of bad debt and the resulting losses would have been far lower.

One clear lesson for regulators is that they need to analyse and quantify systemic risk in the financial sector

in a much better way. While regulators were concentrating on looking at risks in individual institutions, the

build-up of systemic risk in the sector had clearly not been appreciated prior to the outbreak of the crisis.

Clearly, neither the regulatory authorities nor the banks had understood the linkages between the house price

bubble, financial innovation, the growth of leverage in the financial system and the degree of globalization of

the financial sector.

Another lesson is that prior to the outbreak of the crisis there had been too much focus on the capital

adequacy of banks and not enough focus on liquidity issues. Once the crisis began, the drying up of liquidity

- f many financial instruments made them virtually untradeable. For example, the secondary and new issuance
markets for CDOs and other MBSs virtually dried up at points during the credit crunch. In addition, many
financial institutions that were reliant on commercial paper or the interbank lending market for funding
found themselves in major financial di'culties when these sources of funding suddenly ceased to be available.
Many of the financial services intermediaries that failed during the crisis met capital adequacy requirements
but were unable to function due to a lack of liquidity. !is lack of liquidity meant that it became very hard to
establish the prices of the CDOs and MBSs which banks and financial institutions held on their trading books,
and in turn created uncertainty over banks' viability and share prices.

Another issue was the role played by the credit rating agencies. In retrospect, it is clear that the credit rating

agencies applied too high a credit rating to both banks and the securities that they were issuing. !e models

509

International Finance

that they were using to rate new financial products such as CDOs were faulty and underestimated the risks

involved. Without such high ratings the amount of securitization of subprime and other loans would have

been greatly reduced, as would have been the extent of the crisis. It should also be remembered that the credit

rating agencies were assigning a rating based on the potential for default. As such, they were not concerned

with the potential price risk and liquidity issues that investors that bought these instruments might confront.

Some argue that the credit rating agencies should be more heavily regulated, and there is certainly a need to

examine the potential for con$icts of interest on their part. In the run-up to the crisis it is estimated that over

40% of their revenues were being generated from rating structured finance products.

Improved data collection is needed when assessing banks. In particular, the growth of off-balance-sheet

exposures and risks in the form of SPVs and SIVs and other conduits undoubtedly contributed to the crisis.

In addition, the growth of leverage in the financial system was not fully recognized as a source of risk, when

it clearly should have been. Many investment banks and hedge funds were operating with leverage of 20 to 30

times their capital.

Another feature of the crisis was the extent to which it was concentrated in over-the-counter (OTC)

products such as swaps, CDOs, CDSs and the like in which there were significant counterparty risks, risks that

were heavily exposed by the Lehman bankruptcy and failure of AIG. By contrast, exchange traded products

such as futures and options continued to trade effectively throughout the crisis. Exchange traded products

are marked to market on a daily basis and initial and variation margin payments mean that the counterparty

risk is kept to a very low level. By contrast, since OTC instruments do not have such stringent margining

requirements, the risks and potential losses of a counterparty defaulting do not get fully recognized by market

participants until disaster strikes, as happened when both Lehman's and AIG got into di'culty. In the case of

Lehman Brothers, many banks and financial institutions were hit by its failure and suffered large losses due to

the counterparty failure. Further large losses would have been suffered by many banks had the US Treasury

not stepped in to honour the CDSs that AIG Financial Products Division had written. In response to this,

regulators have been encouraging greater transparency concerning bank exposures to OTC products and

encouraging exchanges to develop competing products with proper margining processes.

In retrospect, it seems that once the financial crisis began, some sound financial institutions got themselves

into di'culty by believing that it was an opportunity to expand their business franchise. RBS made a terrible

decision to take over ABN Amro in December 2007, Lloyds TSB acquired HBOS and Bank of America took

- ver Merrill Lynch. !ese takeovers proved disastrous for the acquiring companies since the banks they took
- ver had huge losses on their portfolios that were not fully appreciated at the time of the takeover.

Another issue is the relationship between compensation in the financial sector and profitability. It is clear that

the system of annual bonuses linked primarily to revenues and short-term profits created an incentive for traders

and financial institutions to take on too much risk so as to maximize short-term performance at the expense of

longer-term viability and returns. Many of the profits during the boom years were in fact 'illusory profits' on which

large salaries and bonuses were paid. In reality, many of the transactions at that time were to lead to unprecedented

future losses and destruction of shareholder and bond-holder wealth. Since the financial crisis the authorities have

enacted legislation restricting the size of bonuses payable and linking them to the longer-term performance of the

bank share price by preventing bankers cashing in their shares until a certain number of years have passed.

Tackling the moral hazard problem is an important and tricky issue following the crisis. Central banks

and Treasuries came to the rescue of the financial sector on an unprecedented scale. !is included massive

injections of liquidity into the system, cuts in short-term interest rates, financial support for bank mergers,

state guarantees on interbank loans, government guarantees on bank debt and state insurance limiting future

losses from the crisis. !e financial system was shown to be too important to be allowed to fail and the

problem is exacerbated by the fact that bankers now know that the state will intervene to rescue key financial

510

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

institutions if necessary. Since the financial crisis regulators have been trying to design a system and regulatory

infrastructure that encourages banks to avoid excessive risk-taking such as heavy restrictions on proprietary

trading and raising capital and liquidity ratios to make them more resilient against a future crisis.

!e regulators faced many hard questions following the global financial crisis; some commentators have

accused them of being 'asleep at the wheel'. !ey failed to recognize the build-up of risks in the system, and

generally failed to spot problems in the mortgage market and in the banks and investment houses that were

at the centre of the crisis. !ere were clearly problems of understa'ng, lack of expertise and a mistaken belief

that the banks were using sophisticated modelling techniques to manage their own risks effectively. !ere was

also a problem of coordination between different regulatory authorities. In the USA there are both Federal

and State regulations to be considered, while in the UK the FSA proved to be inept at regulation, and the

responsibility for banking regulation and supervision was returned to the Bank of England in 2010.

!ere has also been increased scrutiny at off-balance-sheet vehicles, such as SIVs and SPVs/SPEs that were

involved in the purchase of so many of the structured finance products where losses were heavily concentrated.

!e lack of transparency in banks' balance sheets prior to the outbreak of the crisis and the use of off-balancesheet vehicles meant that the build-up of systemic risk in the system was not properly recognized until the crisis

started. !e Basel I Accord required large US banks to maintain capital reserves equivalent to 8% of the riskadjusted assets while SPVs/SPEs were not required to hold such reserves. !is created an incentive for banks to

set up SPVs so as to minimize their need for capital reserves. !ere are clearly dangers in banks having both onbalance and off-balance-sheet structures, since the on-balance-sheet report can give a misleading impression of

financial stability when the real risks are hidden in off-balance-sheet SPVs/SPEs and SIVs. !e SIVs turned to

their sponsoring banks when they got into funding di'culties, and the parent banks had problems providing

the necessary liquidity. To some extent the Basel II Accord partially overcame this problem by requiring similar

capital reserves for SPVs. !e Basel III Accord increases bank balance sheet transparency by requiring them

to hold capital against their 'Total Exposure' which is the sum of both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet

exposures. Basel III also requires banks to expand the range of assets used to calculate the risk-weighted assets

(RWA) with much more emphasis being placed on off-balance-sheet liabilities and proprietary trading risks.

As well as raising capital requirements, the Basel III Accord also introduced liquidity requirements on banks.

!ese two measures proved prescient in the sense that they have enabled the financial system and banking

sector to withstand the Covid-19 shock to a much better extent than would have otherwise been the case.

!e longer-term consequences of the financial crisis for national debts, the roles of governments in the

economy, the regulatory system and the financial sector remain in a state of $ux more than a decade and a half

- n from the crisis. What is clear is that the policy response to the crisis meant that the taxpayer has ended up
assuming a significant part of the losses and the financial risks that the banks took on during the boom times.
In return, the public sector now has a significant stake in the form of equity or debt in many large and small
financial institutions. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG are now effectively controlled by the US government.
In Britain the taxpayer still holds a large stake in the RBS and a somewhat smaller stake in Lloyds TSB group,
combined with ownership of Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock.

Finally, the Covid-19 crisis came at a time when economies were close to overcoming many of the

problems raised by the global financial crisis. !is latest crisis has led to further massive quantitative easing,

large increases in fiscal deficits and national debts that will take many years to bring back under control. One

- f the main risks stemming from the Covid-19 crisis is that new money printing will likely finally end the era
- f low in$ation and any rise in in$ation could lead to an abrupt rise in longer-term rates of interest at a time
when governments, corporations and many households have record levels of debt. It will require great skill

- n the part of policy-makers to bring fiscal deficits back under control and ending their quantitative easing
programmes without hindering the economic growth that will be required to prevent the new levels of debt
from being the cause of future financial crises.
