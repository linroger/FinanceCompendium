1.1 INTRODUCTION

When studying open economies that trade with one another, there is a major di$erence in the transactions

between domestic and foreign residents as compared to those between residents of the same country; namely,

that di$ering national currencies are usually involved. A US importer will generally have to pay a Japanese

exporter in yen, a German exporter in euros and a British exporter in pounds. For this reason, the US importer

will have to buy these currencies with dollars in what is known as the foreign exchange market. Te foreign

exchange market is not a single physical place; rather it is de!ned as a market where the various national

currencies are bought and sold. Exactly what factors determine how much domestic currency has to be given

in exchange to obtain a unit of foreign currency, the behaviour of exchange rates and the impact of exchange

rate changes on the economy is one of the major !elds of study in international economics and is the subject

matter of later chapters of this book.

In this chapter, we look at some preliminary issues and examine the various participants in the foreign

exchange market and the basic forces that operate in it. We then examine the basic determinants of

exchange rate behaviour. We proceed to examine various exchange rate definitions and their economic

significance. We then look at the basic operational differences between fixed and floating exchange rate

regimes. The chapter finishes by examining the relationship between the spot and forward exchange

rate.

One of the most fascinating things about the foreign exchange market is the huge sums of money that are

exchanged on a daily basis. Table 1.1 shows the result of surveys carried out by the Bank for International

International Finance

Settlements. Te main centre for foreign exchange trading is London, with some \$3576 billion worth of foreign

exchange traded on a daily basis, quite a lot when one considers that the annual gross domestic product of

the United Kingdom in 2019 was approximately 80.5% of that at $ \$2,879 billion. Other important foreign

exchange centres are New York with \$1370 billion, Tokyo with \$376 billion, Singapore \$640 billion, Paris \$167

billion and Frankfurt \$124 billion. Te net volume of foreign exchange dealing globally was in April 2019

estimated to be in excess of \$8.3 trillion per day.

The Foreign Exchange Market

1.2 EXCHANGE RATE DEFINITIONS

Te exchange rate is simply the price of one currency in terms of another, and there are two methods of

expressing it:

1. Foreign currency units per unit of the domestic currency: taking the pound sterling as the domestic

currency, on 16 December 2020 approximately \$1.35 was required to obtain one pound, that is,

\$1.35/£1;

2. Domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency: again, taking the pound sterling as the

domestic currency, on 16 December 2020 there was approximately £0.7407 required to purchase one

US dollar, that is, £0.7407/\$1.

Te reader will note that the second method is merely the reciprocal of the former. While it is not important

which method of expressing the exchange rate is employed, it is necessary to be careful when talking about a

rise or fall in the exchange rate because the meaning will be very di$erent depending upon which de!nition

is used.

If the !rst de!nition is employed, a rise in the exchange rate from $1.35/£1 to, say, $1.50/£1 would mean

that more dollars are required to purchase one pound, so that the pound has appreciated or, equivalently, the

dollar has depreciated. Conversely, if the second de!nition is used, a rise in the pounds per dollar exchange

rate from, say, £0.6667/$1 to £0.7407/$1 means that more pounds have to be given to obtain a dollar, which

means that the pound has depreciated in value or, equivalently, the dollar has appreciated in value.

_Important note_

For the purposes of this chapter, we shall de!ne the exchange rate as foreign currency units per unit of domestic

currency. Tis is the de!nition most commonly employed in the UK where the exchange rate is quoted as,

for example, dollars or yen per pound and is the de!nition most frequently employed when compiling real

and nominal exchange rate indices (see **section 1.6** ) for all currencies. However, in other chapters of the

book we shall predominately be using the second de!nition which is the de!nition most o,en employed in

the theoretical economic literature. It is important when reading newspapers, articles or other textbooks that

readers familiarize themselves with the particular exchange rate de!nition being employed. Tere is no real

way around this problem. Up until 1 January 1999 British foreign exchange dealers were used to seeing market

quotations as foreign currency per pound, for example Deutschmarks per pound, but since the advent of the

euro they have had to get used to that particular rate being quoted in the market as pounds per euro.

Table 1.2 shows the exchange rates of a variety of currencies as at 16 December 2020 against the major

three currencies: the pound, the US dollar and the euro. We have given only the mid-point quotations of the

currencies, while in reality there are bid–o$er spreads to consider. For sterling the mid-point is \$1.3500/£1,

but in the market there will be two prices quoted – \$1.3498 (bid) and $1.3502 (o$er) – a spread of 4 pips

(price interest points). Te bid rate is the rate at which a bank will buy sterling, while the o$er rate is the rate

at which the bank will sell sterling in exchange for dollars. Te di$erence is known as the bid–o$er spread

and represents the gross pro!t margin of the bank. In the case of sterling, in our example, this spread is equal

to 100 × [(1.3502 – 1.3498)/1.3500] = 0.0296%. Te spread will vary from bank to bank, from currency to

currency and according to market conditions. Tinly traded currencies tend to have the largest spread, which

usually increases if the risks of trading in a particular currency are perceived to have risen.

1.3 CHARACTERISTICS AND PARTICIPANTS OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

Te foreign exchange market (see Figure 1.1) is a worldwide market and is made up primarily of commercial

banks, foreign exchange brokers and other authorized agents trading in most of the currencies of the world.

Tese groups are kept in close and continuous contact with one another and with developments in the market

via telephone, computer terminals, telex and fax.

Easily the most heavily traded currency is the US dollar which is known as a vehicle currency –

because the currency is widely used to denominate international transactions. Oil and many other

important primary products such as tin, coffee and gold all tend to be priced in dollars. Indeed, because

14

The Foreign Exchange Market

**Figure 1.1** Te organization of the foreign exchange market

the dollar is so heavily traded it is usually cheaper for a French foreign exchange dealer wanting Mexican

pesos to first purchase US%dollars with euros and then sell the dollars to purchase pesos rather than

directly purchase the pesos with euros. The main participants in the foreign exchange market can be

categorized as follows:

 - **Retail clients.** Tese are made up of businesses, international investors, multinational corporations
and the like who need foreign exchange for the purposes of operating their businesses. Normally, they
do not directly purchase or sell foreign currencies themselves; rather they operate by placing buy/sell

   - rders with the commercial banks.
 - **Commercial banks.** Te commercial banks carry out buy/sell orders from their retail clients and
buy/sell currencies on their own account (known as proprietary trading) so as to alter the structure

	- f their assets and liabilities in di$erent currencies. Te banks deal either directly with other banks or
through foreign exchange brokers. In addition to the commercial banks, other !nancial institutions
such as merchant banks are engaged in buying and selling currencies both for proprietary purposes
and on behalf of their customers in !nance-related transactions.

 - **Foreign exchange brokers.** O,en banks do not trade directly with one another, rather they o$er to
buy and sell currencies via foreign exchange brokers. Operating through such brokers is advantageous
because, since they collect buy and sell quotations for most currencies from many banks, the most
favourable quotation is obtained quickly and at very low cost. One disadvantage of dealing through
a broker is that a small brokerage fee is payable which is not incurred in a straight bank to bank deal.
Each !nancial centre normally has just a handful of authorized brokers through which commercial
banks conduct their exchanges.

**Box 1.1** Bulls and bears in the foreign exchange market

Speculators are usually classi!ed as bulls or bears according to their view on a particular currency. If

a speculator expects a currency, for example the pound (spot and forward), to appreciate in the future

they are said to be 'bullish' about the currency. It pays the speculator to take a _long position_  - n the

pound, that is, to buy the pound spot or forward at a cheap price today in the hope that they can sell it

at a higher price in the future.

If a speculator expects the pound (spot and forward) to depreciate in the future he or she is said to be

'bearish' about the currency. It will pay the speculator to take a _short position_  - n the currency, that is, to

sell the pound at what they consider to be a relatively high price today in the hope of buying it back at a

cheaper rate sometime in the future.

 - **Central banks.** Normally the monetary authorities of a country are not indi$erent to changes in
the external value of their currency. Even though exchange rates of the major industrialized nations
have been le, to fluctuate freely since 1973, central banks frequently intervene to buy and sell their
currencies in a bid to influence the rate at which their currency is traded. Under a !xed exchange rate
system the authorities are obliged to purchase their currencies when there is excess supply, and sell
the currency when there is excess demand.

1.4 ARBITRAGE IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

One of the most important implications deriving from the close communication of buyers and sellers in

the foreign exchange market is that there is almost instantaneous arbitrage across currencies and !nancial

centres. Arbitrage is the exploitation of price di$erentials for riskless guaranteed pro!ts. To illustrate what is

meant by these two types of arbitrage we shall assume that transaction costs are negligible and that there is

- nly a single exchange rate quotation, ignoring the bid–o$er spread.

**Financial centre arbitrage** ensures that the dollar–pound exchange rate quoted in New York will be the
same as that quoted in London and other !nancial centres. Tis is because if the exchange rate is \$1.36/£1
in New York but only \$1.34/£1 in London, it would be pro!table for banks to buy pounds in London and
simultaneously sell them in New York and make a guaranteed 2 cents for every pound bought and sold. Te
act of buying pounds in London will lead to a depreciation of the dollar in London, while selling pounds in
New York will lead to an appreciation of the dollar in New York. Such a process continues until the rate quoted
in the two centres coincides at, say, \$1.35/£1.

**Cross currency arbitrage** . To illustrate what is meant by currency arbitrage let us suppose that the
exchange rate of the dollar against the pound is \$1.35/£1 and the exchange rate of the dollar against the
euro is \$1.2175/€1. Currency arbitrage implies that the exchange rate of the euro against the pound will be
€1.1088/£1 (1.35/1.2175 = 1.1088). If this were not the case, say there was 1.25 euros per pound, then a UK
dealer wanting dollars would do better to !rst obtain 1.25 euros which would then buy \$1.5219 making
nonsense of a \$1.35/£1 quotation. Te increased demand for euros would quickly appreciate its rate against
the pound to the €1.1088/£1 level. Table 1.3 shows a set of cross rates for the major currencies.

**Box 1.2** Bid–offer spreads in the forex market: which bank will trade with which

bank?

Some banks are keen to buy a currency because they are short of it and others are keen to sell a currency

because they have too much of it. Tis means that banks will quote slightly di$erent bid–o$er quotes on

a currency in the interbank market. Imagine we have three banks A, B and C who make the following

bid–o$er quotes on the pound:

|Col1|$/£ quotes bid –offer|
|---|---|
|Bank A|1.3498–1.3502|
|Bank B|1.3497–1.3501|
|Bank C|1.3499–1.3503|

In the above, the !rst quote is the bid rate which is the price at which the bank will buy pounds in

exchange for dollars; so, for example, Bank A is willing to buy sterling at $1.3498 per £1. Te o$er rate

is the rate at which a bank will sell sterling in exchange for dollars; so Bank A is willing to sell pounds

in exchange for \$1.3502 per £1. If you are a dealer working with Bank D then you will be keen to be

matched with the bank o$ering you the best possible deal. Tis is where the services of foreign exchange

brokers are vital, for they provide the best possible quotes for immediate execution by collecting quotes

from many banks and execute a trade at the best possible price for banks that use their services.

If you are a trader working for Bank D and wish to buy £10 million then you wish to give as few

dollars as possible and therefore the broker will match you with Bank B at \$1.3501/£1, so you will be

required to give \$13,501,000 to get £10 million, which is much better than handing over \$13,503,000,

which is what Bank C requires. So, although the di$erence between Bank B and Bank C is only 0.02 of a

cent, this translates to \$2,000 on a £10 million trade – well worth saving. If, however, Bank D wishes to

17

International Finance

sell £10 million then its broker will match it with the bank o$ering the most dollars in return, which is

Bank C at \$1.3499/£1, which amounts to \$13,499,000. Tis is much better than Bank B with its quote of

\$1.3497/£1, which amounts to \$13,497,000 and which is \$2,000 less than Bank C. Given that exchange

rate quotes are constantly changing on a second by second basis then the ability to deal via a broker

at the best possible rate is a valuable service. Te e$ective bid–o$er quote facing Bank D is \$1.3499–

\$1.3501, which is only 2 pips. In the world of !nance a small di$erence in quotes can be quite signi!cant

in monetary terms, given the sums involved. Competition between banks means that bid–o$er spreads

for major currencies are kept down to very low levels.

1.5 THE SPOT AND FORWARD EXCHANGE RATES

Foreign exchange dealers not only handle a wide variety of currencies but they also have a set of dealing rates

for each currency, which are known as the 'spot' and 'forward' rates.

**Te spot exchange rate.** Tis is the quotation between two currencies for immediate delivery. In other words,
the current exchange rate of two currencies vis-à-vis each other. In practice, there is normally a two-day lag
between a spot purchase or sale and the actual exchange of currencies to allow for veri!cation, paperwork and
clearing of payments.

**Te forward exchange rate.** In addition to the spot exchange rate it is possible for economic agents to agree
today to exchange currencies at some speci!ed time in the future, most commonly for one month (30 days),
three months (90 days), six months (180 days), nine months (270 days) and one year (360 days). Te rate of
exchange at which such a purchase or sale can be made is known as the forward exchange rate. Exactly why
economic agents may engage in forward exchange transactions and how the forward exchange rate quotation
is determined is a subject we shall look at later in this chapter.

1.6 NOMINAL, REAL AND EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATES

Policy-makers and economists are very much concerned about analysing the implications of exchange

rate changes for the economy and the balance of payments. Te exchange rate itself does not convey much

information, and to analyse the e$ects and implications of exchange rate changes economists compile indices

- f the nominal, real and e$ective exchange rates. Since most national and international authorities quote such
rates as foreign currency per unit of domestic currency, we shall compile some hypothetical nominal, real and
e$ective exchange rates using this de!nition. Tis means that a rise of the nominal, real or e$ective exchange
rate index represents an appreciation of the currency being indexed.

_Nominal exchange rate_

Te exchange rate that prevails at a given date is known as the nominal exchange rate; it is the amount of US

dollars that will be obtained for one pound in the foreign exchange market, for example, \$1.35/£1. Similarly, if

the euro quotation is €1.1088/£1, this is again a nominal exchange rate quotation. Te nominal exchange rate

is merely the price of one currency in terms of another with no reference made to what this means in terms of

purchasing power of goods/services. Te nominal exchange rate is usually presented in index form; if at the

18

The Foreign Exchange Market

base period the exchange rate is \$1.35/£1 and one period later the exchange rate is \$1.2150/£1, the nominal

index of the pound will change from the base period value of 100 to 90. A depreciation or appreciation of the

nominal exchange rate does not necessarily imply that the country has become more or less competitive on

international markets; for such a measure we have to look at the real exchange rate.

_Real exchange rate_

Te real exchange rate is the nominal exchange rate adjusted for relative prices between the countries under

consideration. It is normally expressed in index form algebraically as:

_Sr_ [=] _S_ _P_ _[P][*]_

where _S_ r is the index of the real exchange rate, _S_ is the nominal exchange rate (foreign currency units per

unit of domestic currency) in index form, _P_ is the index of the domestic price level and _P_ - is the index of the

foreign price level.

Table 1.4 illustrates the compilation of hypothetical nominal and real exchange rate indices for the pound,

and shows what exactly changes in the real exchange rate measure. In the !rst period the real exchange rate

index is set equal to 100. A basket of UK goods priced at £100 will cost a US resident \$135, while a basket of

US goods priced at \$135 would cost a UK resident £100. Between period 1 and period 2 there is no change in

the nominal exchange rate which remains at \$1.35/£1; however, the UK price index rises while the US index

remains the same. Tis means that there has been a real appreciation of the pound: UK goods now become

relatively more expensive for US residents as they now have to use \$162 to purchase the original bundle of UK

goods which now cost £120; the bundle of US goods still costs \$135 and a British citizen £100. Tis decreased

British competitiveness is picked up by the real exchange rate appreciation of the pound from 100 to 120.

Clearly, since the nominal exchange rate index has remained at 100, it has failed to pick up the loss in UK

competitiveness.

In Table 1.4, between periods 2 and 3, UK prices remain unchanged while US prices increase; however, the

pound appreciates sufficiently that the UK gains no competitive advantage. Between periods 3 and 4, UK prices

rise and US prices fall but the competitive disadvantage to the UK is o$set by a substantial depreciation of the

pound, so that there is a real depreciation of the pound, meaning an improvement in UK competitiveness.

**Table 1.4** Construction of nominal and real exchange rate indices of the pound

|Period|Nominalexchange<br>rate|Nominalexchange<br>rateindexof£|UKpriceindex|USpriceindex|Realexchange<br>indexof£|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|\$1.35/£1|100|100|100|100|
|2|\$1.35/£1|100|120|100|120|

|5|\$1.08/£1|80|150|125|96|

_Notes_ :%Te real exchange rate index of the pound is constructed by multiplying the nominal exchange rate index by the UK price index

and dividing this by the US price index.Te e$ective exchange rate index is constructed by multiplying the $/£ index by 0.3 and the €/£

index by 0.7.

19

International Finance

Finally, between periods 4 and 5, although UK prices rise much more than US prices, making the UK less

competitive, this is o$set by a large nominal depreciation of the pound and, overall, a real depreciation of

the pound. From this example it is clear that the real exchange rate monitors changes in a country's price

competitiveness. Real exchange rate indices unlike nominal exchange rate indices are not publishable on a

daily basis because the consumer price indices used are normally only published monthly.

Figures 1.2 and 1.3 show the evolution of the dollar–pound and yen–dollar nominal and real exchange rate

indices between 1973 and 2021, compiled using quarterly data and consumer price indices. Te !gures show

that there have been very substantial movements in both nominal and real exchange rates over this period.

_Effective exchange rate_

Since most countries of the world do not conduct all their trade with a single foreign country, policy-makers

are not so much concerned with what is happening to their exchange rate against a single foreign currency

but rather what is happening to it against a basket of foreign currencies with which the country trades. Te

e$ective exchange rate is a measure of whether or not the currency is appreciating or depreciating against

a weighted basket of foreign currencies. In order to illustrate how an e$ective exchange rate is compiled

consider the hypothetical case of the UK conducting 30% of its foreign trade with the US and 70% of its trade

with the Eurozone area. Tis means a weight of 0.3 will be attached to the bilateral exchange rate index with

the dollar and 0.7 to the euro.

Table 1.5 shows movements of a hypothetical e$ective exchange rate index for the pound. Te US dollar

has a 30% weight and the euro a 70% weight. Between periods 1 and 2 the pound remains the same against

the dollar but depreciates 10% against the euro. As the euro has a greater weight than the dollar the e$ective

exchange rate index indicates an overall depreciation of 7%. Period 3 leads to an appreciation against the

US dollar and no change against the euro, and the resulting appreciation of the e$ective exchange rate is

consequently less marked than the appreciation against the dollar. In period 4, the pound depreciates against

both the dollar and euro and consequently there is a depreciation of the e$ective exchange rate. Finally, in

period 5 the pound depreciates against the US dollar and appreciates to a lesser extent against the euro;

however, the e$ective exchange rate depreciates only marginally because more weight is attached to the

appreciation against the euro than to the depreciation against the dollar.

While the nominal e$ective exchange rate is easy to compile on a daily basis and normally provides a

reasonable measure of changes in a country’s competitive position for periods of several months, it does

not take account of the e$etc of price movements. In order to get a better idea of changes in a country's

competitive position over time we would need to compile a real e$ective exchange rate index. For this, we

would !rst of all compile the real exchange rate index against each of the trading partners’ currencies, and

then use the same procedure as for compiling the nominal e$ective exchange rate index. Table 1.6 shows the

nominal e$ective exchange rate indices for the major industrialized countries since 1980, while Table 1.7

shows the real e$ective exchange rate indices for the major industrialized countries using consumer price

indices for calculation purposes.

**Table 1.5** Construction of a nominal e$ective exchange rate index of the pound

_Note_ : Te e$ective exchange rate index of the pound is constructed by multiplying the $/£ index by 0.3 and the €/£ index by 0.7 and

adding the resulting two !gures.

1.7 A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE DETERMINATION OF THE SPOT EXCHANGE RATE

Since the adoption of floating exchange rates in 1973 there has developed an exciting new set of theories

attempting to explain exchange rate behaviour, generally known as the modern asset-market approach

to exchange rate determination. We shall be looking in some detail at these theories in Chapters 7–9. For

the time being, we shall look at a simple model of exchange rate determination which was widely used

prior to the development of these new theories. Despite its shortcomings the model serves as a useful

introduction to exchange rate determination and is a prerequisite for the understanding of Chapters

1–6 of this book. Te basic tenet of the model is that the exchange rate (the price) of a currency can

be analysed like any other price by a resort to the tools of supply and demand. Te exchange rate of

the pound will be determined by the intersection of the supply and demand for pounds on the foreign

exchange market.

_The demand for foreign exchange_

Te demand for pounds in the foreign exchange market is a derived demand; that is, the pounds are not

demanded because they have an intrinsic value in themselves, but rather because of what they can buy.

Table 1.8 shows the derivation of a hypothetical demand for pounds schedule with respect to changes in the

exchange rate. As the pound appreciates against the dollar, that is, moves from \$1.20/£1 towards \$1.50/£1,

the price of the UK export to US importers increases, which leads to a lower quantity of exports and with it a

reduced demand for pounds. Hence, the demand curve ( _D_ ) for pounds which is depicted in Figure 1.4 slopes

down from le, to right.

In this simple model, the demand for pounds depends upon the demand for UK exports. Any factor which

results in an increase in the demand for UK exports, that is, column 4 in Table 1.8, will result in an increased

demand for pounds and a shi, to the right of the demand curve for pounds. Among factors that result in a

rightward shi, of the demand schedule for pounds are a rise in US income, a change in US tastes in favour of

UK goods and a rise in the price of US goods. All these factors would result in an increased demand for UK

exports and hence pounds. Te e$etc of an increase in the demand for pounds is to shi, the demand schedule

to the right.

_The supply of foreign exchange_

Te supply of pounds is in essence the UK demand for dollars. Table 1.9 sets out the derivation of a

hypothetical supply of pounds schedule. As the pound appreciates, the cost of US exports becomes cheaper

for UK residents. As such, they demand more US exports and this results in an increased demand for dollars

**Table 1.8** Derivation of the demand for pounds

which are purchased by increasing the amount of pounds supplied in the foreign exchange market, and this

yields an upward-sloping supply of pounds (Figure 1.5).

Te supply of pounds schedule ( _S_ ) depends upon the UK demand for US exports; its position will shi,

to the right if there is an increase in UK income, a change in British tastes in favour of US goods or a rise

in UK prices. All these factors imply an increased demand for US goods and dollars which is reflected in an

increased supply of pounds.

Since the exchange market is merely a market which brings together those people that wish to buy a currency

(which represents the demand) with those that wish to sell the currency (which represents the supply), then

the spot exchange rate can most easily be thought of as being determined by the interaction of the supply and

demand for the currency. Figure 1.6 illustrates the determination of the dollar–pound exchange rate in the

context of such a supply and demand framework. Te !gure depicts the supply and demand for pounds in the

foreign exchange market. Te equilibrium exchange rate is determined by the intersection of the supply and

demand curves ( _S_ and _D_ ) to yield a dollar–pound exchange of \$1.35/£1. When the exchange rate is le, to float

freely it is determined by the interaction of the supply and demand curves.

1.8 ALTERNATIVE EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES

At the Bretton Woods conference of 1948 the major nations of the Western world agreed to a pegged exchange

rate system, each country !xing its exchange rate against the US dollar with a small margin of fluctuation

around the par value. In 1973 the Bretton Woods system broke down and the major currencies were le, to be

determined by market forces in a floating exchange rate world. Te basic di$erences between the two regimes

can be highlighted using the supply and demand framework.

_Floating exchange rate regime_

Under a floating exchange rate regime the authorities do not intervene to buy or sell their currency in the

foreign exchange market. Rather, they allow the value of their currency to change due to fluctuations in the

supply and demand of the currency. Tis is illustrated in Figure 1.7.

In Figure 1.7(a) the exchange rate is initially determined by the interaction of the demand ( _D_ 1) and supply

( _S_ 1) of pounds at the exchange rate of \$1.35/£1. Tere is an increase in the demand for UK exports which shi,s

the demand curve from _D_ 1 to _D_ 2, and this increase in the demand for pounds leads to an appreciation of the

pound from $1.35/£1 to $1.50/£1. Figure 1.7(b) examines the impact of an increase in the supply of pounds

due to an increased demand for US exports and therefore dollars. Te increased supply of pounds shi,s the

_S_ 1 schedule to the right to _S_ 2 resulting in a depreciation of the pound to \$1.20/£1. Te essence of a floating

exchange rate is that the exchange rate adjusts in response to changes in the supply and demand for a currency.

_Fixed exchange rate regime_

For various reasons, governments can intervene to try and !x the exchange rate around certain levels. For

example, an appreciation of the exchange rate might be considered undesirable as it would hit the economy's

exports, while a depreciation might be considered undesirable since it would lead to a rise in the cost of imports

and endanger the central bank's inflation target. Indeed, many countries around the world continue to maintain

!xed exchange rates against currencies such as the US dollar, since it is perceived to be vital for economic

stability. Te Hong Kong dollar, for instance, has been pegged to the US dollar at HK$7.80/$1 since%1982.

We will now examine the implications of foreign exchange intervention to !x the exchange rate using a

hypothetical example of the Bank of England attempting to peg the exchange rate of the pound against the

US dollar. In so doing we will make a crucial distinction between 'non-sterilized intervention' and 'sterilized

intervention'. With non-sterilized intervention the buying/selling of sterling in the foreign exchange market

a$ects the UK money supply and interest rates. Frequently, however, authorities will attempt to restore

domestic money supply and interest rates back to their levels before the foreign exchange market intervention

took place, and this is known as sterilized foreign exchange market intervention. As we shall see, while nonsterilized intervention is likely to be e$ective in moving the exchange rate in the desired direction, there is

good reason to doubt that sterilized intervention can have much of an impact.

In Figure 1.8(a) the exchange rate is assumed to be !xed by the authorities at the point where the demand

schedule ( _D_ 1) intersects the supply schedule ( _S_ 1) at \$1.35/£1. If there is an increase in the demand for pounds

which shi,s the demand schedule from _D_ 1 to _D_ 2, there is a resulting pressure for the pound to appreciate. To

avert an appreciation it is necessary for the Bank of England to sell _Q_ 1– _Q_ 2 of pounds in the foreign exchange

market by purchasing US dollars, these sterling sales shi,ing the supply of pounds from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2. Such an

intervention weakens the pound exchange rate back to \$1.35/£1, increasing the Bank of England's reserves of

US dollars while increasing the amount of pounds in circulation from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 and lowering UK interest

rate, as shown in Figure 1.8(b).

Te e$ect on the UK money market of the Bank of England selling pounds in the foreign exchange market

is to increase the UK money supply from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 and consequently lower the UK short-term rate of interest

from _r_ 1 to _r_ 2 in Figure 1.8(b). Since the sale of pounds has increased the UK money supply the intervention

is of the non-sterilized type. Such an intervention is likely to be very e$ective in weakening the pound from

\$1.50/£1 because it increases the amount of sterling in circulation and lowers the UK interest rate, both of

which will reinforce the e$ects of selling pounds in the foreign exchange market in weakening the pound to

the desired level. Non-sterilized intervention of this type that directly a$ects the money supply and shortterm interest rate is very e$ective in moving the exchange rate in the desired direction.

Te Bank of England could just do as above and allow the foreign exchange market intervention to increase

the UK money supply and lower the UK interest, but this would risk overshooting the Bank's inflation target.

In such circumstances, the Bank might try to sterilize the e$ects of the increased money supply by selling UK

Treasury bills to the public in an open-market operation that would reduce the money supply in Figure 1.8(b)

from _M_ 2 back to the original level _M_ 1. However, the Treasury bill sales would reduce the price of Treasury bills

and raise the UK interest rate from _r_ 2 back to _r_ 1. Te reduction in the amount of pounds and the rise in interest

rates resulting from the sterilization policy would then tend to increase the attractiveness of pounds in the

foreign exchange market and start shi,ing the demand for sterling ( _D_ 2) to the right such that the pound would

head back towards \$1.50/£1, as the UK money supply and interest rates return to their levels _M_ 1 and _r_ 1 prior

to the foreign exchange market intervention. As such, it is highly unlikely that a sterilized foreign exchange

market intervention would be e$ective in achieving the weaker pound desired by the Bank of England.

Tis begs the question as to why the central bank would wish to sterilize their foreign exchange market

interventions, as this would undermine its ability to achieve the desired exchange rate. Part of the answer is

that the central bank may hope to have a psychological impact on market participants whilst sticking to its

monetary and interest rate targets. Te fact that the Bank of England has been selling pounds in the foreign

exchange market, even though sterilized, might reduce the demand for pounds in the market in the very short

run. Having said this, most traders will tend to discount central bank intervention unless they see it is of the

non-sterilized type leading to changes in money-market interest rates.

In Figure 1.9(a) the exchange rate is assumed to be !xed by the authorities at the point where the demand

schedule ( _D_ 1) intersects the supply schedule ( _S_ 1) at \$1.35/£1. If there is an increase in the supply of pounds

in the foreign exchange market the supply schedule shi,s from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2 and there is a resulting pressure

for the pound to depreciate to \$1.20/£1. To avert a depreciation, it is necessary for the Bank of England to

buy _Q_ 1– _Q_ 2 pounds with dollars from its foreign exchange reserves in the foreign exchange market, these

purchases shi,ing the demand for pounds from _D_ 1 to _D_ 2. Such an intervention, by raising the demand for

pounds, enables the exchange rate to remain !xed at \$1.35/£1, decreases the Bank of England's reserves of US

dollars and decreases the amount of pounds in circulation.

Te e$ect on the UK money market of the Bank of England buying pounds in the foreign exchange market

is to decrease the UK money supply from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 and consequently raise the UK short-term interest rate

from _r_ 1 to _r_ 2. Since buying pounds in the foreign exchange market has reduced the UK money supply from

_M_ 1 to _M_ 2, the intervention is of the non-sterilized type. It is likely to be very e$ective in strengthening the

pound back to \$1.35/£1 because it decreases the amount of sterling in circulation and raises the UK interest

rate, both of which reinforce the e$etc of buying pounds in the foreign exchange market to strengthen the

pound to the desired level.

Again, the Bank of England could do as above and allow the foreign exchange market intervention to

decrease the UK money supply and raise the UK interest rate, but this would risk the Bank undershooting

its inflation target, possibly leading to an unwanted slowdown in the UK economy. In such circumstances

the Bank might try to sterilize the e$ects of the decreased money supply by buying UK Treasury bills from

the public in an open-market operation, raising the money supply in Figure 1.9(b) from _M_ 2 back to the

- riginal level _M_ 1. Te problem with doing this, however, is that the Treasury bill purchases will raise the
price of Treasury bills and thereby lower the UK interest rate from _r_ 2 back to _r_ 1. Te increase in the amount

- f pounds and the fall in interest rates resulting from the sterilization policy would then tend to decrease
the attractiveness of pounds in the foreign exchange market and therefore induce further selling pressure
which, by shi,ing the supply from _S_ 2 further to the right, would mean that the pound would tend to go back
towards \$1.20/£1, as the UK money supply and interest rates return to their levels _M_ 1 and _r_ 1 prior to the
foreign exchange market intervention. Again, it is highly unlikely that a sterilized foreign exchange market
intervention would be e$ective in achieving the stronger pound desired by the Bank of England.

Te lesson of this section is clear. If the authorities want to influence the exchange rate then the most e$ective

type of foreign exchange market intervention would be of the non-sterilized type because such intervention

leads to changes in the money supply and interest rates that reinforce the impact of the intervention. If the

authorities decide to sterilize the impact of their interventions on the money supply, through o$setting openmarket operations that move the money supply and interest rates back to the levels prior to the intervention,

then they will most likely have only a limited exchange rate impact since none of the fundamentals change.

**Box 1.3 The foreign exchange rate policy of the People's Bank of China**

Te People's Bank of China (PBOC) is the central bank of the People's Republic of China. Since the mid1990s the Chinese economy has been growing very rapidly. Economic growth has in large part been

fuelled by a rapid increase in exports and high levels of investment. In 1995 exports were around 20% of

GDP but by 2011 they were 40%. For many years the Chinese authorities pegged the renminbi exchange

rate at RMB 8.25/\$1. Since there was a massive demand to buy renminbi to buy Chinese exports and a

high demand by foreign companies to undertake foreign direct investment in China the PBOC had to

sell renminbi to buy US dollars to maintain the peg. It was only on 22 July 2005 under pressure from

the United States with a huge current account de!cit of \$750 billion that the Chinese changed their

foreign exchange policy such that the renminbi would be pegged to a basket of !ve currencies, enabling

a gradual appreciation to occur over time against the US dollar. Following the adoption of the new

foreign exchange policy, the PBOC continued to sell renminbi and buy dollars to prevent the renminbi

appreciating too rapidly. Te foreign exchange intervention of the PBOC was by and large of the nonsterilized type, resulting in a rapid growth of the Chinese money supply and low interest rates which

stimulated a property and stock market boom. In addition, there was an unprecedented rise in the

foreign exchange reserves of the PBOC which rose from \$165 billion in 2000 to a peak of \$3,843 billion

by 2014, easily the largest foreign exchange reserves of any country in the world. Te reserve increases

suggest that the PBOC had been buying the equivalent of approximately \$263 billion a year up till 2014

since the turn of the century.

In Figure 1.10(a), we have the renminbi–dollar exchange rate starting at RMB 8.25/\$1. Tere is heavy

selling of dollars to buy renminbi represented by a shi, to the right of the supply curve for dollars

from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2. Le, to a free market the exchange rate would change from RMB 8.25/\$1 to, say, RMB

5/\$1. However, the PBOC buys dollars ( _Q_ 2 _Q_ 3) through its foreign exchange interventions, shi,ing the

demand curve for dollars from _D_ 1 to _D_ 2. Te e$etc of the intervention is that the appreciation of the

renminbi is limited to only RMB 6.2/$ rather than the RMB 5/\$1 that would occur in a free market.

1.9 THE DETERMINATION OF THE FORWARD EXCHANGE RATE

Te forward exchange market is where buyers and sellers agree to exchange currencies at some speci!ed date

in the future. For example, a UK trader who has to pay \$13,000 to his US supplier in one year’s time to buy

\$13,000 dollars for delivery at the one-year forward exchange rate of \$1.30/£1. Te question that naturally

arises is, why should anyone wish to agree today to exchange currencies at some speci!ed time in the future? To

answer this question we need to look at the various participants in the forward exchange market. Traditionally,

economic agents involved in the forward exchange market are divided into three groups, distinguished by

their motives for participation in the foreign exchange market.

_Hedgers_

**Hedgers** are agents (usually !rms) that enter the forward exchange market to protect themselves against
exchange rate fluctuations which entail exchange rate risk. By 'exchange risk' we mean the risk of loss due to
adverse exchange rate movements. To illustrate why a !rm may engage in a forward exchange rate transaction,
consider the example of a UK importer who is due to pay for goods from the USA to the value of \$13,000 in

- ne year's time. Let us suppose that the spot exchange rate is \$1.35/£1 while the one-year forward exchange
rate is \$1.30/£1. By buying dollars forward at this rate the trader can be sure that he only has to pay £10,000.
If he does not buy forward today, he runs the risk that in one year's time the spot exchange rate may be worse
than \$1.30/£1, such as \$1.20/£1, which would mean him having to pay £10,833 (\$13,000/1.20). Of course, the
spot exchange rate in one year’s time may be more favourable than \$1.30/£1, such as \$1.50/£1, in which case
he would only have had to pay £8,667 (\$13,000/1.5), which would _ex post_ have been better than engaging in
a forward exchange contract. However, by engaging in a forward exchange contract the trader can be sure of
the amount of sterling he will have to pay for the imports, and as such he can protect himself against the risk
entailed by exchange rate fluctuations.

It may be asked why the importer does not immediately buy US\$13,000 spot at \$1.35/£1 for £9,630 and

hold the dollars for one year. One reason is that he may not at present have the necessary funds for such a

spot purchase and is reluctant to borrow the money, knowing that he will have the funds in one year's time

because of money from sales of goods. By engaging in a forward contract he can be sure of getting the dollars

he requires at a known exchange rate, even if he does not yet have the necessary sterling. Another reason is

that such an argument ignores the interest rate di$erential: the pound is at a forward discount because the

UK interest rate is greater than the US interest rate, as will be seen when looking at the covered interest rate

parity condition.

In e$ect, hedgers avoid exchange risk by matching their assets and liabilities in the foreign currency. In

the above example, the UK importer buys \$13,000 forward (his asset) and will have to pay \$13,000 for the

imported goods (his liability).

_Arbitrageurs_

**Arbitrageurs** are agents (usually banks) that aim to make a riskless pro!t out of discrepancies between
interest rate di$erentials and what is known as the forward discount or forward premium. A currency is
said to be at a forward premium if the forward exchange rate quotation for that currency represents an
appreciation for that currency compared to the spot quotation; whereas a currency is said to be at a forward
discount if the forward exchange rate quotation for that currency represents a depreciation for that currency

32

The Foreign Exchange Market

compared to the spot quotation. Te forward discount or premium is usually expressed as a percentage of the

spot exchange rate; that is:

_F_                         - _S_

Forward discount / premium                -                - 100

_S_

where _F_ is the forward exchange rate quotation and _S_ is the spot exchange rate quotation.

Te presence of arbitrageurs ensures that what is known as the **covered interest parity** (CIP) condition holds

continually – this is the formula used by banks to calculate their forward exchange quotation and is given by:

( _r*_   - _r_ )

_F_ - - _S_

( _1_   - _r_ ) _[S]_

(1.1)

where _F_ is the one-year forward exchange rate quotation in foreign currency per unit of domestic currency,

_S_ is the spot exchange rate quotation in foreign currency per unit of domestic currency, _r_ is the one-year

domestic interest rate and _r_ - is the one-year foreign interest rate.

Equation (1.1) has to be amended by dividing the three-month interest rates by four to calculate the threemonth forward exchange rate quotation, and by dividing the six-month interest rates by two to calculate the

six-month forward exchange rate. Table 1.11 shows how the calculation works in practice using the dollar–

sterling exchange rate and some hypothetical interest rate data. We have used some hypothetical interest rates

for $LIBOR and £LIBOR. Tese are interest rates at which one bank based in London will lend either dollars

- r pounds (typically millions) to another bank for either one month, three months, six months or one year.
Te interest charged varies with the length of the loan.

**Table 1.11** Te $/£ forward exchange quotations and UK and US interest rates using hypothetical data

|12 month|1.2991|6.00|2.00|

_Note_ : Te spot sterling exchange rate is assumed to be \$1.3500/£1.

Te one-month forward exchange rate is calculated as:

[(0.017– 0.05)/12] 1.3500 + 1.3500 = \$1.3463/£1.

[1 + (0.05/12)]

Te three-month forward exchange rate is calculated as:

[(0.018 – 0.052)/4] 1.3500 + 1.3500 = \$1.3387/£1.

[1 + (0.052/4)]

Te six-month forward exchange rate is calculated as:

[(0.019 – 0.055)/2] 1.3500 + 1.3500 = \$1.3264/£1.

[1 + (0.055/2)]

Te one-year forward exchange rate is calculated as:

[(0.02 – 0.06)] 1.3500 +1.3500 = \$1.2991/£1.

International Finance

Numerical Example

Calculation of the forward exchange rate:

Suppose that the one-year dollar interest rate is 2%, the sterling interest rate is 6% and the spot rate of the

dollar against the pound is \$1.35/£1. Ten the one-year forward exchange rate of the pound is:

_F_             -             - 0.02 0.06�             - 1.35             - 1.35             - \$1.2991/ £1

1.06

_F_                - _S_ 1.2991 1.35 100�                
Since                -                -                - 3.77%

_S_ 1.35

Te one-year forward rate of sterling is at an annual forward discount of 3.77%.

To understand why CIP must be used to calculate the forward exchange rate consider what would happen

if the forward rate was di$erent to that calculated in the example; say it was \$1.25/£1. In this instance, a UK

investor with £100 could earn the UK interest rate and at the end of the year have £106, but by selling pounds

spot (at \$1.35/£1) and simultaneously buying pounds forward (at \$1.25/£1) he would have \$135, earning the

US interest rate of 2% giving him $137.70 ($135×1.02) at the end of one year, which he would sell at a forward

price of \$1.25/£1, giving £110.16. Clearly, it pays a UK investor to sell pounds spot and buy pounds forward.

In fact, it would pay to borrow £100 knowing that he would have to pay back £106 but would make £110.16

by buying the dollars spot and selling dollars forward. With a sufficient number of investors doing this, the

forward rate of the pound would appreciate until such arbitrage possibilities were eliminated. With a spot rate

- f \$1.35/£1, only if the forward rate is at \$1.2991/£1 will the guaranteed yields in US and UK time deposits be
identical, since \$137.70 divided by \$1.2991/£1 equals £106. Only at this forward exchange rate are there no
riskless arbitrage pro!ts to be made.

Since the denominator in equation (1.1) is typically very close to unity, the equation can be simpli!ed to

yield an approximate expression for the forward premium/discount:

_F_                 - _S_

                  - _r_                   -                   - _r_ (1.2)

_S_

Tis approximate version of CIP says that if the domestic interest rate is higher than the foreign interest rate,

then the domestic currency will be at a forward discount by an equivalent percentage on an annualized basis;

while if the domestic interest rate is lower than the foreign interest rate the currency will be at a forward

premium by an equivalent percentage on an annualized basis. In our example, the US interest rate of 2% less

the UK interest rate of 6% indicates an annual forward discount on the pound of 4%, which is an approximation

to the actual 3.77% discount obtained using the full CIP formula.

_Speculators_

**Speculators** are agents that hope to make a pro!t by accepting exchange rate risk. Speculators engage in
the forward exchange market because they believe that the future spot rate corresponding to the date of the
quoted forward exchange rate will be di$erent to the quoted forward rate. Consider: if the one-year forward
rate is quoted at \$1.30/£1 and a speculator feels that the spot rate will be \$1.15/£1 in one year's time, in this

34

The Foreign Exchange Market

instance he may sell £1,000 forward at \$1.30/£1 to obtain \$1,300 and hope to change the dollars back into

pounds in one year's time at \$1.15/£1 to obtain £1,130.43, making £130.43 pro!t. Of course, the speculator

may be wrong and !nds that in one year’s time the spot exchange rate is above $1.30/£1, say at $1.50/£1, in

which case his \$1,300 are worth £866.67, implying a loss of £133.33. A speculator hopes to make money by

taking an 'open position' in the foreign currency. In our example, he has a forward asset in dollars which is not

matched by a corresponding liability of equal value.

1.10 THE INTERACTION OF TRADERS, HEDGERS, ARBITRAGEURS, AND SPECULATORS

Te forward exchange rate is determined by the interaction of traders, hedgers, arbitrageurs, and speculators.

One of the conditions that must hold in the forward exchange market is that for every forward purchase there

must be a forward sale of the currency so that the excess demand for the currency sums to zero:

_NDH_ + _NDA_ + _NDS_ = 0

where _NDH_ is the net demand of hedgers, _NDA_ is the net demand of arbitrageurs and _NDS_ is the net demand

- f speculators.

Te forward exchange rate and volume of forward transactions is determined jointly by the actions of

arbitrageurs, traders and speculators and is jointly determined with the spot exchange rate. Tis is illustrated

in Figure 1.11 that depicts the simultaneous determination of the spot and forward exchange rates.

Figure%1.11(a) shows the supply and demand situation in the spot market, and Figure 1.11(b) the supply and

demand schedules in the forward market. Te AA schedule reflects the forward exchange rate consistent

with CIP. In e$ect, this is the net supply and demand of forward exchange of arbitrageurs for a given interest

di$erential. Since the pound is at a forward discount, the interest rate in the UK is above that in the USA. Te

_D_ H schedule is the hedgers' _net_ demand for pounds in the forward exchange market; as the pound depreciates

in the forward market then hedgers' net demand for pounds rises.

**Figure 1.11** Te joint determination of the spot and forward exchange rate

International Finance

Te _D_ S schedule is the demand schedule for forward exchange of speculators; it cuts the vertical axis at

\$1.22/£1. Tis means that \$1.22/£1 represents the average forecast of speculators since at this rate speculators

would be neither net purchasers nor sellers of forward pounds. However, because speculators on average

expect the pound to depreciate more than is indicated by the forward exchange rate, they are net sellers of

pounds forward if the rate is above \$1.22/£1 (because they expect to be able to buy pounds in the future at a

better rate than they sold them) and net purchasers of pounds forward if the forward rate is below \$1.22/£1

(because they expect to be able to sell in the future at a better rate than they purchased them).

Ultimately, the arbitrage formula as given by CIP is crucial to the forward rate which is determined along

the arbitrage schedule AA at \$1.30/£1. At this rate, hedgers happen to be net purchasers of pounds given by

_D_ H1 while speculators happen to be net sellers of pounds given by _D_ S1. Since the net purchases of hedgers

exceed the net sales of speculators, then there is pressure for the forward rate to rise above \$1.22/£1, which

induces arbitrageurs to be net sellers of pounds forward (constituting net sales equal to _D_ H1 – _D_ S1) so as to clear

the forward exchange market.

Speculators are at work in both the spot and forward exchange markets. If they decide that the current spot

rate is overvalued they may sell spot so that the currency depreciates; if interest rates do not change then both

the spot and forward exchange rates depreciate. Similarly, if speculators feel that the currency is overvalued

forward then they will sell forward and both the forward and spot exchange quotations will depreciate. Hence,

arbitrage ties the spot and forward exchange market quotations together via the CIP condition. Speculation

and hedging may be thought of as determining the level of the spot and forward exchange quotations.

1.11 CONCLUSIONS

Te need for a foreign exchange market arises because international trade in goods/services and !nancial

assets almost always involves the exchange of di$ering national currencies. Were the world economy to have

a single currency, then a foreign exchange market would not exist. Te modern foreign exchange market is

truly a global market and is characterized by a huge volume of daily transactions.

Much of the topic of international !nance is about the forces that determine exchange rate movements

and the implications of these movements for trade and economic growth and the development of the world

economy. When conducting an economic analysis of the e$ects of exchange rate changes, it proves useful to

distinguish between the real and nominal exchange rates and between bilateral and e$ective exchange rates,

depending upon the purpose of the particular analysis being undertaken.

Governments are not indi$erent to movements in the value of their currencies in the foreign exchange

market, and on occasions they intervene in an attempt to influence the rate of exchange at which their

currencies are traded. Indeed, many governments have for various reasons decided to peg their exchange

rates, such as the Hong Kong dollar tied to the US dollar.

Although exchange rates may move quite substantially at times, this is not necessarily disruptive to

international trade as companies can protect themselves against exchange risk by hedging in the forward

exchange market. For many countries, the depreciation or devaluation of their currencies is an important

mechanism for maintaining their international competitiveness and trade volumes.

2.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter we will look at one of the most important economic indicators for policy-makers in an

- pen economy, namely the balance of payments. What is happening to a country's balance of payments

-,en captures the news headlines and can become the focus of attention. A good or bad set of !gures
can have an influential e$etc on the exchange rate and can lead policy-makers to change the content of
their economic policies. De!cits may lead to the government raising interest rates or reducing public
expenditure in order to reduce expenditure on imports. Indeed, for a country with a !xed exchange rate
and persistent de!cits there could be a speculative attack on the country forcing it to devalue its currency.
Alternatively, de!cits may lead to calls for protection against foreign imports or capital controls to defend
the exchange rate.

Before considering various policy options that may be devised to deal with perceived problems in the

balance of payments, we need to consider in some detail exactly what the balance of payments !gures are

and what is meant by the notion of a balance of payments surplus or de!cit. In this chapter, we shall look

at what is contained in the balance of payments statistics, how they are compiled and various possible

economic interpretations of the statistics. We will also look at how the current account of the balance

- f payments can be interpreted within the framework of the national income accounts and the e$ects of
changes in governments' expenditure and exports on the national income and balance of payments in an

- pen economy.

2.2 WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?

Te balance of payments is a statistical record of all the economic transactions between residents of the

reporting country and residents of the rest of the world during a given time period. Te usual reporting

period for all the statistics included in the accounts is a year. However, some of the statistics that make up

the balance of payments are published on a more regular monthly and quarterly basis. Without question

the balance of payments is one of the most important statistical statements for any country. It reveals how

many goods and services the country has been exporting and importing and whether the country has been

borrowing from or lending money to the rest of the world. In addition, whether or not the central monetary

authority (usually the central bank) has added to or reduced its reserves of foreign currency is reported in

the statistics.

A key de!nition that needs to be resolved at the outset is that of a domestic and foreign resident. It is

important to note that citizenship and residency are not necessarily the same thing from the viewpoint

- f the balance of payments statistics. Te term 'residents' comprises individuals, households, !rms and
the public authorities. Tere are some problems that arise with respect to the de!nition of a resident, for
example multinational corporations are by de!nition resident in more than one country. For the purposes

- f balance of payments reporting, the subsidiaries of a multinational are treated as being a resident in the
country in which they are located, even if their shares are not actually owned by domestic residents. Another
problem concerns the treatment of international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the World Bank, the United Nations, the European Commission and so forth. Tese institutions are
treated as being foreign residents even though they may actually be located in the reporting country. For
example, although the IMF is located in Washington, contributions by the US government to the Fund are
included in the US balance of payments statistics because they are regarded as transactions with a foreign
resident. Tourists are regarded as being foreign residents if they stay in the reporting country for less than

a year.

Te criterion for a transaction to be included in the balance of payments is that it must involve a transaction

between a resident of the reporting country and a resident of the rest of the world. Purchases and sales between

residents of the same country are excluded.

2.3 COLLECTION, REPORTING AND PRESENTATION OF THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

STATISTICS

Te balance of payments statistics record all of the transactions between domestic and foreign residents, be

they purchases or sales of goods, services or !nancial assets such as bonds, equities and banking transactions.

Reported !gures are normally in the domestic currency of the reporting country. Obviously, collecting

statistics on every transaction between domestic and foreign residents is an impossible task. Te authorities

collect their information from the customs authorities, surveys of tourist numbers and expenditures, and data

- n capital inflows and outflows which are obtained from banks, pension funds, multinationals and investment
houses. Information on government expenditures and receipts with foreign residents is obtained from local
authorities and central government agencies. Te statistics are based on reliable sampling techniques but,
nevertheless, given the variety of sources, the !gures provide only an estimate of the actual transactions. Te
responses from the various sources are compiled by government statistical agencies. In the United States, the
statistics are compiled by the US Department of Commerce and in the United Kingdom by the Office for
National Statistics.

38

The Balance of Payments

Tere is no unique method governing the presentation of balance of payments statistics and there can be

considerable variations in the presentations of di$erent national authorities. However, the IMF provides a

set of guidelines for the compilation of balance of payments statistics published in its _Balance of Payments_

_Manual_ . In addition, the Fund publishes the balance of payments statistics of all its member countries in

a standardized format facilitating intercountry comparisons. Tese are presented in two publications – the

_Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook_ and _International Financial Statistics_ .

In the USA, the value of exports and imports is compiled on a monthly basis and likewise in the UK. Te

monthly !gures are subject to later revision and two sets of statistics are published: the seasonally adjusted

!gure and the unadjusted !gure. Te seasonally adjusted !gures correct the balance of payments !gures for

the e$etc of seasonal factors to reveal underlying trends.

2.4 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTS

An important point about a country's balance of payments statistics is that in an accounting sense it always

balances. Tis is because it is based upon the principle of double-entry bookkeeping. Each transaction between

a domestic and foreign resident has two sides to it, a receipt and a payment, and both of these are recorded in

the balance of payments statistics. Each receipt of currency from residents of the rest of the world is recorded

as a credit item (a plus in the accounts), while each payment to residents of the rest of the world is recorded

as a debit (a minus in the accounts).

Before considering some examples of how di$erent types of economic transactions between domestic and

foreign residents get recorded in the balance of payments, we need to consider the various sub-accounts that

make up the balance of payments. Te statistics are divided into three main sections: the current account, the

capital and !nancial account, and the settlements account. Te reason for dividing the balance of payments

into these three main parts is that the current account items refer to income flows, the capital and !nancial

account records changes in the assets and liabilities of the private sector and non-central-bank public sector,

and the settlements account records any changes in assets and liabilities of the central bank. A simpli!ed

example of the annual balance of payments accounts for Americana is presented in Table 2.1.

2.5 AN OVERVIEW OF THE SUB-ACCOUNTS IN THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

_The trade balance_

Te trade balance is sometimes referred to as the visible balance because it represents the di$erence between

receipts for exports of goods and expenditure on imports of goods which can be visibly seen crossing frontiers.

Te receipts for exports are recorded as a credit in the balance of payments, while the payment for imports is

recorded as a debit. When the trade balance is in surplus this means that the country has earned more from

its exports of goods than it has paid for its imports of goods.

_The current account balance_

Te current account balance is the sum of the visible trade balance and the invisible balance. Te invisible

balance shows the di$erence between revenue received for exports of services and payments made for imports

- f services such as shipping, tourism, insurance and banking. In addition, receipts and payments of interest,
dividends and pro!ts are recorded in the invisible balance because they represent the rewards for investment
in overseas companies, bonds and equity, while payments reflect the rewards to foreign residents for their
investment in the domestic economy. As such, they are receipts and payments for the services of capital that
earn and cost the country income, just as do exports and imports.

The reader will note that there is an item referred to as 'unilateral transfers' included in the invisible

balance; these are payments or receipts for which there is no corresponding quid pro quo. Examples

- f such transactions are migrant workers' remittances to their families back home, the payment of
pensions to foreign residents, and foreign aid. Such receipts and payments represent a redistribution

- f income between domestic and foreign residents. Unilateral payments can be viewed as a fall in

40

The Balance of Payments

domestic income due to payments to foreigners and so are recorded as a debit, while unilateral receipts

can be viewed as an increase in income due to receipts from foreigners and consequently are recorded

as a credit.

_The capital and financial account_

Te capital and !nancial account records transactions concerning the movement of capital into and out

- f the country. Capital comes into the country by borrowing, sales of overseas assets and investment in
the country by foreigners. Tese items are referred to as 'capital inflows' and are recorded as credit items
in the balance of payments. _Capital inflows are, in effect, a decrease in the country's holding of foreign_
_assets or an increase in liabilities to foreigners._ Capital inflows are recorded as pluses, and the easiest way
to understand why they are pluses is to think of foreign borrowing as the export of an IOU. Similarly,
investment by foreign residents in the domestic economy can be thought of as the export of equity or
bonds, while sales of overseas investments to foreigners is an export of those investments to foreigners.
Conversely, capital leaves the country due to lending, buying of overseas assets and purchases of domestic
assets owned by foreign residents. Tese items represent capital outflows and are recorded as debits in
the capital account. _Capital outflows are, in effect, an increase in the country's holding of foreign assets or_
_a decrease in liabilities to foreigners._ Tese items are recorded as debits as they represent the purchase of
an IOU from foreigners, the purchase of foreign bonds or equity and the purchase of investments in the
foreign economy.

Items in the capital and !nancial account are normally distinguished according to whether they

- riginate from the private or public sector and whether they are of a short-term or long-term nature. Te
summation of the capital inflows and outflows as recorded in the !nancial account gives the !nancial
account balance.

_Settlements balance_

Te settlements balance shows transactions (if any occur) undertaken by the central bank. Tere are two key

items that are recorded in the settlements account: (i) rises and falls in foreign exchange reserves; (ii)%borrowing

funds or repayments of loans to international organizations such as the IMF.

A central bank normally holds a stock of reserves made up of foreign currency assets, principally US

Treasury bonds (the US authorities hold mainly euro and yen Treasury bonds). Such reserves are held

primarily to enable the central bank to purchase its currency should it wish to prevent it depreciating.

If a central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to purchase its currency then its foreign

exchange reserves fall and this is recorded as a plus in the settlements account. Conversely, if a central

bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to sell its currency then its foreign exchange reserves rise

and this is recorded as a minus in the settlements account. Te fact that reserve increases are recorded as a

minus, while reserve falls are recorded as a plus in the balance of payments statistics, is usually a source of

confusion. It is most easily rationalized by thinking that reserves increase when the authorities have been

purchasing the foreign currency because the domestic currency is strong. Tis implies that the other items

in the balance of payments are in surplus, so reserve increases have to be recorded as a debit to ensure

- verall balance. Conversely, reserves fall when the authorities have been supporting a currency that is
weak, that is, all other items sum to a de!cit so reserve falls must be recorded as a plus to ensure overall
balance.

41

International Finance

If a country has to borrow funds from the IMF then this is an increase in its liabilities and is recorded

as a plus in the settlements account. Conversely, when a country pays back the loan to the IMF then this is

a reduction in its liabilities and is recorded as a minus in its settlements account. Borrowing from the IMF

usually comes with strict conditions attached and repayments on the loans are usually expected to occur

within three to !ve years from the loans being made.

_The statistical error_

Given the huge statistical problems involved in compiling the balance of payments statistics, there will usually

be a discrepancy between the sum of all the items recorded in the current account, !nancial account and the

settlements balance – which in theory should sum to zero. To ensure that the credits and debits are equal

it is necessary to incorporate a **statistical error** for any di$erence between the sum of credits and debits

in the three accounts. Tere are several possible sources of this error. One of the most important is that it

is an impossible task to keep track of all the transactions between domestic and foreign residents; many of

the reported statistics are based on sampling estimates derived from separate sources, so that some error is

unavoidable. Another problem is that the desire to avoid taxes means that some of the transactions in the

capital and !nancial account are underreported. Moreover, some dishonest !rms may deliberately underinvoice their exports and over-invoice their imports so as to deflate arti!cially their pro!ts. Another problem

is one of 'leads and lags'. Te balance of payments records receipts and payments for a transaction between

domestic and foreign residents, but it can happen that a good is imported but the payment delayed. Since the

import is recorded by the customs authorities and the payment by the banks, the time discrepancy may mean

that the two sides of the transaction are not recorded in the same set of%!gures.

2.6 RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONS IN THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

To understand exactly why the sum of credits and debits in the balance of payments should sum to zero we

will consider some examples of economic transactions between domestic and foreign residents. Tere are

basically !ve types of economic transactions that can take place between domestic and foreign residents:

1. An exchange of goods/services in return for a !nancial asset.
2. An exchange of goods/services in return for other goods/services. Such trade is known as barter or

countertrade.

3. An exchange of a !nancial item in return for a !nancial item.
4. A transfer of goods or services with no corresponding quid pro quo (for example, military and food aid).
5. A transfer of !nancial assets with no corresponding quid pro quo (for example, migrant workers'

remittances to their families abroad or a money gi,).

We will now look at how each transaction is recorded twice, once as a credit and once as a debit. Table 2.2

considers various types of transactions between US and UK residents and shows how each transaction is

recorded in each of the two countries' balance of payments. Te exchange rate for all transactions is assumed

to be \$1.35/£1.

Te examples in Table 2.2 illustrate in a simpli!ed manner the double-entry nature of balance of payments

statistics. Since each credit in the accounts has a corresponding debit elsewhere, the sum of all items should be

equal to zero. Tis naturally raises the question as to what is meant by a balance of payments de!cit or surplus.

2.7 WHAT IS MEANT BY A BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SURPLUS OR DEFICIT?

As we have seen in Table 2.2, the balance of payments always balances since each credit in the account has

a corresponding debit elsewhere. However, while the overall balance of payments always balances, this does

not mean that each of the individual accounts that make up the balance of payments is necessarily in balance.

For instance, the current account can be in surplus while the capital account is in de!cit. When talking about

43

International Finance

a balance of payments de!cit or surplus, economists are really saying that a subset of items in the balance of

payments are in surplus or de!cit.

_The trade account and current account_

Tese two accounts derive much of their importance because estimates are published on a monthly basis by

most developed countries. Since the current account balance is concerned with both visible and invisibles

it is generally considered to be the more important of the two accounts. What really makes a current

account surplus or de!cit important is that a surplus means that the country as a whole is earning more

than it is spending and, as such, is increasing its stock of claims on the rest of the world or is reducing its

indebtedness; while a de!cit means that the country as a whole is spending more than it is earning and is

therefore reducing its net claims on the rest of the world or is increasing its indebtedness. Furthermore,

as we shall see in Chapter 3, the current account can readily be incorporated into economic analysis of an

- pen economy. More generally, the current account is likely to quickly pick up changes in other economic
variables, such as changes in the real exchange rate, domestic and foreign economic growth, and relative
price inflation.

_The basic balance_

Tis is the current account balance plus the net balance on long-term capital flows. Te basic balance was

considered to be particularly important during the 1950s and 1960s period of !xed exchange rates because

it was viewed as bringing together the stable elements in the balance of payments. It was argued that any

signi!cant change in the basic balance must be a sign of a fundamental change in the direction of the balance

- f payments. Te more volatile elements such as short-term capital flows and changes in official reserves were
regarded as below-the-line items.

Although a worsening of the basic balance is supposed to be a sign of a worsening economic situation,

having an overall basic balance de!cit is not necessarily a bad thing. For example, a country may have a current

account de!cit that is reinforced by a large long-term capital outflow so that the basic balance is in a large

de!cit. However, the capital outflow will yield future pro!ts, dividends and interest receipts that will help to

generate future surpluses on the current account. Conversely, a surplus in the basic balance is not necessarily a

good thing. A current account de!cit which is more than covered by a net long-term capital inflow so that the

basic balance is in surplus could be open to two interpretations. It might be argued that because the country

is able to borrow over the long run there is nothing to worry about, since the country is regarded as viable by

those foreigners who are prepared to lend money over the long run to the country. Another interpretation

could argue that the basic balance surplus is a problem because the long-term borrowing will lead to future

interest, pro!ts and dividend payments which will worsen the current account de!cit.

Apart from interpretation, the principal problem with the basic balance concerns the classi!cation of

shortand long-term capital flows. Te usual means of classifying long-term loans or borrowing is that they

be of at least 12 months to maturity. However, many long-term capital flows can be easily converted into

short-term flows if need be. For example, the purchase of a !ve-year US Treasury bond by a UK investor

would be classi!ed as a long-term capital outflow in the UK balance of payments and as a long-term capital

inflow in the US balance of payments. However, the UK investor could very easily sell the bond back to US

investors any time before its maturity date. Similarly, many short-term items with less than 12 months to

maturity automatically get renewed so that they e$ectively become long-term assets. Another problem that

blurs the distinction between short-term and long-term capital flows is that transactions in !nancial assets are

44

The Balance of Payments

classi!ed in accordance with their original maturity date. Hence, if a,er four and a half years a UK investor

sells his or her !ve-year US Treasury bond to a US citizen it will be classi!ed as a long-term capital flow even

though the bond has only six months to maturity.

Despite its flaws, the basic balance concept could still have some relevance today if one counts net foreign

direct investment (FDI) as the long-term capital account balance. A country that has a current account de!cit

but is a net recipient of FDI could be interpreted as a sign of con!dence in the long-term prospects of the

economy: the FDI will increase the country's capital stock and future export earnings. On the other hand,

a country with a current account de!cit and net FDI outflows could be interpreted as a sign of a struggling

economy in which investment opportunities lie abroad rather than at home. Some countries, such as China,

seem to have a virtuous circle whereby a surplus in the current account and a positive net FDI inflow leads to

an increase in their net exports in the future.

_The settlements balance_

Te official settlements balance focuses on the operations that the monetary authorities have to undertake to

!nance any combined imbalance in the sum of the current account and !nancial account. With the settlements

concept, the autonomous items are all the current and !nancial and capital account transactions including

errors, while the accommodating items are those transactions that the monetary authorities have undertaken

as indicated by the settlements balance. Te current account and capital account items are all regarded as

being induced by independent households, !rms and central and local government and are regarded as the

autonomous items. If the sum of the current and capital accounts is negative, the country can be regarded

as being in de!cit as this has to be !nanced by the authorities drawing on their reserves of foreign currency,

borrowing from foreign monetary authorities or the IMF.

Te official settlements concept of a surplus or de!cit is not as relevant to countries that have floating

exchange rates as it is to those with !xed exchange rates. Tis is because if exchange rates are le, to float

freely the official settlements balance will tend to zero because the central authorities neither purchase nor

sell their currency and so there will be no changes in their reserves. If the sales of a currency exceed the

purchases, then the currency will depreciate; if sales are less than purchases, the currency appreciates. Te

settlements concept is, however, very important under !xed exchange rates because it shows the amount of

pressure on the authorities to devalue or revalue the currency. Under a !xed exchange rate system a country

that is running an official settlements de!cit will !nd that sales of its currency exceed purchases, and to avert

a devaluation of the currency authorities have to sell reserves of foreign currency to purchase the home

currency. On the other hand, under floating exchange rates and no intervention, the official settlements

balance automatically tends to zero as the authorities do not buy or sell the home currency, since it is le, to

appreciate or depreciate.

Even in a !xed exchange rate regime the settlements concept ignores the fact that the authorities have

- ther instruments available with which to defend the exchange rate, such as capital controls and interest rates.
Also, it does not reveal the real threat to the domestic currency and official reserves represented by the liquid
liabilities held by domestic and foreign residents that might switch suddenly out of the currency.

Although in 1973 the major industrialized countries switched from a !xed to a floating exchange rate

system, many developing countries continue to peg their exchange rate to the US dollar and consequently

attach much signi!cance to the settlements balance. Indeed, to the extent that industrialized countries

continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market to influence the value of their currencies, the settlements

balance retains some signi!cance, and news about changes in the reserves of the authorities is of interest to

foreign exchange dealers as a guide to the amount of official intervention in the foreign exchange market.

Te IMF provides an annual summary of the balance of payments statistics using these alternative concepts

- f balance of payments disequilibrium. Its balance of payments statistics for eight major nations in 2019 are
presented in Table 2.3. Table 2.4 summarizes the key balance of payments concepts.

Having looked at the balance of statistics we will now proceed to analyse the record US balance of payment

de!cits and how the current account is an integral part of the national income accounts. We will also examine

the impact of changes in government expenditure and exports upon both the economy and the current account.

The Balance of Payments

**Table 2.4** Summary of key balance of payments concepts

2.8 THE NET INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

When a country invests abroad in foreign bonds, equities and money market securities it is increasing its

holding of external !nancial assets. On the other hand, when foreigners purchase domestic bonds, equities

and domestic money market securities these !nancial investments are liabilities of the domestic residents to

the foreign residents. Te di$erence between a country's ownership of foreign !nancial assets and its !nancial

liabilities to foreign residents is known as its net international investment position (NIIP). If the external

!nancial assets are greater than the external !nancial liabilities then the NIIP of the country will be positive

and the country is a net creditor nation. If, however, the liabilities are greater than the assets then the NIIP of

the country is negative and it is a net debtor.

If a country runs a current account de!cit then this will mean it has to be !nanced by either selling assets

to foreigners or borrowing the funds, which will worsen its NIIP position by making it less positive or more

negative, other things being equal. On the other hand, if a country runs a current account surplus then it earns

more than it spends as a country and so thereby lends money to the rest of the world and/or repays debts it

- wes to the rest of the world, so increasing its assets and/or decreasing its liabilities, thus making its NIIP less
negative or more positive, other things being equal. Such a country's current account de!cit/surplus can, over
time, have a signi!cant impact on its NIIP position.

47

International Finance

However, the NIIP is also a$ected by things other than the current account. One of the other major determinants

is valuation changes in the external !nancial assets and liabilities of the country. For example, if foreign stock

markets and foreign bonds held by the domestic residents rise in value then the NIIP position improves, while

if they fall in value the NIIP deteriorates. Similarly, a fall in the valuation of domestic !nancial securities held by

foreign residents will improve the NIIP, while rises in their value lead to a deterioration in the NIIP.

Te other factor that heavily influences the NIIP is fluctuations in the exchange rate. Consider the case of

the United States. It has a negative NIIP since the value of its foreign assets measured in US dollars is less than

the value of its liabilities as measured in US dollars. If the US dollar depreciates by 10% then its foreign assets

become worth more, measured in US dollars, while its liabilities are not directly a$ected by the fall in the

dollar and this therefore improves its NIIP, while an appreciation reduces the value of foreign !nancial assets,

as measured in US dollars, so leading to a deterioration in the US NIIP. Of course, for foreign economies

such as Japan and China a depreciation of the dollar will mean an appreciation of their currencies, which

reduces the value of their claims on the United States when measured in yen and renminbi, so leading to a

deterioration in their NIIP positions as measured in yen and renminbi.

Table 2.5 shows the net international investment position of the United States and how it has gone from

being a net creditor country of \$360 billion in 1980 to a net debtor nation of \$13,950 billion in 2020. A major

cause of this has been the fact that the US has been running current account de!cits ever since 1982, which

have to be !nanced by either selling assets to foreign residents or increasing liabilities to foreign residents. Of

course the NIIP is also a$ected by changes in the market values of the assets and liabilities. So even though the

US had large current account de!cits in 2009 and 2010, its NIIP actually improved from minus \$3,260 billion

in 2008 to minus \$2,471 billion as the market value of its liabilities measured in dollars rose by less than the

market value of its assets measured in US dollars.

While the United States is currently a net debtor nation, as Tables 2.5 and 2.6 show, it is not alone. Te

UK, France and Italy are all net debtor nations as measured by their NIIPs. By contrast, countries that

tend%to run persistent current account surpluses such as Germany, China and Japan are all creditor nations

as measured by their NIIPs. Tis makes sense, as countries that run persistent de!cits have to !nance the

de!cits by selling foreign assets and increasing their liabilities, while countries that run persistent surpluses

increase their foreign assets by lending and/or are able to reduce their liabilities to foreign residents.

2.9 DO THE UNITED STATES CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS MATTER?

Since 1982 the United States current account has moved from a position of a small surplus to ever-increasing

de!cits, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of gross domestic product. Te plain fact is that for four

decades the United States' economy as a whole has been consistently spending abroad more than it has been

earning from abroad; the country as a whole has also been spending more than it has been producing and

making up the di$erence by borrowing from abroad. Te ever-increasing size of the current account de!cits

and their signi!cance and sustainability has provoked an intense debate between economists about the

desirability and sustainability of these de!cits. As can be seen in Table 2.7 the size of these de!cits widened

dramatically in the run up to the credit crunch, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP.

In 1982 the United States was the world's biggest creditor nation, but it is now the world's biggest debtor

nation – its NIIP at the end of 2020Q3 being a negative \$13,950 billion or around 66.6% of US GDP, up from

- nly 3.6% of GDP in 1995. At any point in time, the United States' NIIP !gure is a$ected by three factors: (1)
the size of the US current account – a current account de!cit means the NIIP will worsen by the amount of the
current account de!cit since it needs to borrow the equivalent sum from foreign residents; (2) changes in%the
local currency values of US assets and liabilities, for example the value of foreign stocks and bonds held by US
residents (US assets) and the value of US stocks and bonds held by foreign residents (US liabilities) – if US
holdings of foreign stocks and bonds rise in price more than foreign holdings of US stocks and bonds this helps
to improve the United States' NIIP; and (3) changes in the dollar exchange rate, for example a depreciation of
the dollar against the euro will raise the dollar value of US residents' holdings of euro-denominated assets and
thereby help improve the United States' NIIP.

Another problem for the United States, as Mann (2002) points out, is that its income elasticity of demand

for imports appears to be quite high at 1.80, while the foreign income elasticity of demand for US exports

is quite low at 0.8. Tis asymmetry of how US economic growth a$ects imports and how world economic

growth a$ects US exports means that if the US economy and the rest of the world grow at the same rate, the

current account de!cit will continue to widen unless the exchange rate of the dollar persistently depreciates

(see also Obstfeld and Rogo$, 2000).

Roubini and Setser (2004) show that there was a decreased appetite for US investments on the part of

the foreign private sector in terms of less willingness to hold US stocks and bonds. However, this lack of

private sector demand has been replaced by heavy Asian central bank intervention attempting to prevent their

currencies appreciating against the dollar. In particular, the Bank of Japan and the People's Bank of China were

large purchasers of US dollar Treasury securities – Asian bank holdings of US Treasury bonds have increased

dramatically since 2000. Without such heavy purchases the dollar might have fallen quite signi!cantly on a

trade-weighted basis and this may also account for why US Treasury bond yields have been very low over this

period, despite large !scal de!cits under the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations.

Clearly, however, there is a limit to the amount that foreign central banks will be willing to purchase of

US-denominated assets since the more they purchase the greater their losses could be should the dollar

depreciate or US interest rates rise. Should such purchases cease, then it would be difficult for the United

States to attract the capital inflow required to !nance its current account de!cits without either a large

depreciation of the dollar making US assets look cheap to purchase and/or a rise in US interest rates to

attract foreign investors.

Some economists, such as Cooper (2001), are less worried about the US de!cits, arguing that the United

States is a strong highly productive economy which is dynamic and innovative, with well-functioning goods,

labour and capital markets (with liquid securities), combined with political stability that will make good use

- f the borrowed money over time, providing foreign investors with a relatively 'high and reliable' return on
their investments. Cooper (2001, pp. 219–20) states that:

50

The Balance of Payments

Te language of current account de!cits is unfortunate: it reverses the economic logic and suggests that

in the U.S. case a de!cit is undesirable, even though it reflects a vote of con!dence by the rest of the

world in the United States, or at least in claims on Americans. Put another way, the United States has

demonstrated strong comparative advantage in exporting stocks, bonds, bank deposits, and other claims

  - n such U.S. assets as real estate and U.S. domiciled !rms under foreign management control (that is,
foreign direct investment) … Nearly half of all foreign claims on the United States are interest bearing,
and U.S. interest rates in recent years have been higher than those in Europe, and much higher than
in Japan. Tis has allowed the United States to attract and hold funds from those areas and elsewhere.
Other parts of the world have been through !nancial crises, resulting in higher interest rates, but also in
much greater uncertainty about their exchange rates and even the prospect of repayment.

Cooper (2007) argues that, while the rest of the world tends to invest heavily in US Treasuries which pay

relatively low yields, the United States tends to invest heavily abroad in foreign equities and companies which

tend to generate higher yields over the longer run. As such, he argues that the US can continue to run de!cits

since its debt repayments are on average much lower than the return on its holdings of foreign assets.

McKinnon (2001, p. 229) argues that because the dollar is a vehicle currency widely used for trade invoicing,

by !nancial markets, !nancial institutions and by central banks, the demand for US dollar-denominated assets

will remain strong: 'this status of the dollar as international money, providing the central currency in the world

system, is a natural monopoly'. Even if private-sector demand for the dollar were to wane, McKinnon (2001,

p. 237) is con!dent the slack would be taken up by foreign central banks keen to prevent their currencies

appreciating against the dollar:

Absent monetary instability in the center country, the dollar standard is robust and could continue

without the United States running up against signi!cant borrowing constraints from the rest of the

world. Any incipient run on the dollar would be o$set by foreign central banks accumulating dollar

reserves in order to prevent their currencies from appreciating, because to do otherwise would impose

a loss on their countries' international mercantile competitiveness.

Tere are examples of other advanced economies accumulating net international debt of over 50% of GDP

without obvious adverse e$ects. Australia’s NIIP in 2011 was a negative 64% of GDP and New Zealand’s

was a negative 90% of GDP. However, countries like Spain (negative 87% of GDP in 2011), Greece (negative

83% in 2011) and Portugal (negative 108% in 2011), who have all su$ered signi!cant crises especially in the

period 2010–13 suggest there are signi!cant dangers. Others authors, such as Roubini and Setser (2004), are

also sceptical about the US ability to !nance its de!cits, pointing out that the USA is a large economy and

is consuming a disproportionate amount of world savings to !nance its current account de!cit. In addition,

Mann (2002, p. 149) warns:

Te global investor may continue for a time to increase holdings of U.S. assets, particularly if the relative

risk-reward pro!le holds up. At some point, however, global investors will reach, or even go beyond, the

desired proportion of U.S. assets in their portfolios. If the current account de!cit continues to be large

at a time when global investors no longer wish to add more U.S. assets to their portfolio, the current

account de!cit will not be sustainable, and an economic adjustment must occur.

Several mechanisms could lead to an eventual correction of the US current account de!cit: (1) a rise in real

US interest rates which would lead to more private savings and less private investment, with an accompanying

slowdown in the US economy and net imports; (2) a depreciation of the dollar in real trade-weighted terms

51

International Finance

which over time should increase US exports and decrease imports; (3) a decrease in the US budget de!cit via

a mixture of tax rises and/or a decrease in government expenditure which would again slow the US economy

and decrease imports; and (4) an increase in economic growth rates in countries and regions like Japan,

Europe and Asia which would increase the demand for US exports.

One advantage that the USA does have over many other countries is that its external debt is denominated

in its own currency, unlike typical emerging market economies that o,en have much of their external debt

denominated in foreign currencies; hence it can always print the money to service and redeem its debts, for

example US Treasury bonds held by foreign central banks. In this sense the USA has a large advantage over

most emerging market economies: a rapid depreciation of the dollar would not increase the real cost to the

United States of servicing its debt, whereas currency crises in emerging markets leading to the depreciation

- f their currencies against the dollar have had major adverse consequences for many of their companies and
banks that had dollar-denominated debts.

Tere are clearly signi!cant risks to foreign holders of US assets, such as the Bank of Japan and the

People's Bank of China that have large holdings of US securities and who would su$er substantial losses if US

interest rates rise and/or the dollar depreciates. Since US liabilities in 2020 are around \$43.2 trillion there are

potentially substantial losses to foreigners; from each 10% decline of the dollar they would lose approximately

\$4.34 trillion as measured in their own currencies. As Roubini and Setser (2004, p. 6) have warned:

No doubt the dollar's position as the world's reserve currency and the depth of U.S. !nancial markets

creates an intrinsic source of demand for both dollars and dollar denominated assets. However, this

could prove to be a mixed blessing. Te dollar's privileged position could increase the risk that the world

will !nance large U.S. trade de!cits for too long, leading to excessive U.S. debt accumulation. Tis will

let the U.S. delay needed adjustment, but increase the cost of the adjustment when it !nally happens.

In the longer run, it is clear that the US current account de!cits do matter, since increasing external

indebtedness raises the interest payments the US has to make to the rest of the world, which implies less

money to buy goods/services in the future. A large structural current account de!cit also acts as a constraint

- n economic growth since strong economic growth leads to even bigger current account de!cits (unless it is
export-led economic growth). Also, increased external indebtedness over time increases the probability of
there being a sharp correction at some point in the future, which would imply a signi!cant fall in the dollar, a
rise in US interest rates and possibly a prolonged and signi!cant recession for the US economy. Tere is also
the risk of a !nancial crisis resulting from a loss of con!dence on the part of !nancial markets and foreign
central banks about the potential for a large depreciation of the US dollar. Finally, of course, there is the threat

- f protectionism: the larger the US current account de!cits and the correspondingly greater the bilateral
surpluses of Japan and China, the greater the risks that protectionist elements in the USA will surface.

2.10 SOME OPEN ECONOMY IDENTITIES

In an open economy, gross domestic product (GDP) di$ers from that of a closed economy because there is

an additional injection – export expenditure which represents foreign expenditure on domestically produced

goods. Tere is also an additional leakage – expenditure on imports which represents domestic expenditure

- n foreign goods and raises foreign national income. Te identity for an open economy is given by:

_Y_             - _C_             - � _I_ _G_             - _X_             - _M_ (2.1)

52

The Balance of Payments

where _Y_ is national income, _C_ is domestic consumption, _I_ is domestic investment, _G_ is government expenditure,

_X_ is export expenditure and _M_ is import expenditure.

If we deduct taxation _T_ from the right-hand side of equation (2.1) we have:

_Yd_ [�] + _C_ _I_ + _G_ + _X_                  - _M_                  - _T_ (2.2)

where _Y_ d is disposable income.

If we denote private savings as _S_ = _Y_ d – _C_ we can rearrange equation (2.2) to obtain:

( _X_   - _M_ )   - ( _S_   - _I_ )   
Current account - Netsaving /

(2.3)

Equation (2.3) is an important identity: it says that a current account de!cit has a counterpart in either

private dissaving, that is, private investment exceeding private saving and/or in a government de!cit, that

is, government expenditure exceeding government taxation revenue. Te equation is merely an identity and

says nothing about causation. Nonetheless, it is o,en stated that the current account de!cit is due to the lack

- f private savings and/or the government budget de!cit. However, it is possible that the causation runs the
- ther way: that it is the current account de!cit that may be responsible for the lack of private savings or budget
de!cit. Te identity has been much talked about since the 1980s (see Box 2.1).

**Box 2.1 Current accounts and government fiscal policies**

Te fact that a country's current account (CA) is made up of the government budget surplus/de!cit and

net private savings/dissavings has led to very di$erent perspectives on current account imbalances. Table

2.8 shows the relevant components for the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan.

Interesting comparisons were made between the current account de!cits of the USA and the UK in

the 1980s. Many economists blamed the rapidly growing US current account de!cit from 1982 onwards

as due to the steep rise in the US budget de!cit from 1.4% of GDP in 1980 to an average 3.5% of GDP in

1986. Te UK current account moved into a heavy de!cit from 1987 onwards; however, because the UK

government was running a budget surplus, it claimed that the current account position was primarily

a private-sector phenomenon due to high investment and there was no need for remedial action by the

government. Te contrasts naturally led economists to propose di$erent solutions to the de!cits in both

countries. Much of the US policy debate was concerned with reducing the federal budget de!cit, while

discussion in the UK focused upon measures designed to encourage private-sector savings (reducing

private consumption) and reduce investment. Te UK government pursued a tight monetary policy

with a signi!cant rise in UK interest rates.

Te United States' current account has worsened considerably since 1998, and by 2006 the de!cit

had reached record proportions of 6.0% of GDP. Again, there was much focus on the size of the budget

de!cits, following President Bush's tax cuts, but also on low savings and the pick-up in investment

resulting from the extremely low short-term interest rate policy pursued by the Federal Reserve

following the large falls in the US stock market and the bust of 'dot com' stocks (the Federal Reserve cut

the Fed funds rate from 6.5% in June 2000 to a mere 1% in July 2003).

Many economists believe that the reason why Germany and Japan had such persistent surpluses

in their current accounts in the 1980s was that they have had much higher savings ratios. Following

German reuni!cation, however, the German current account position deteriorated noticeably due to

a combination of worsening public !nances, brought on by the huge cost of propping up the former

East German economy, and a consumer boom as East Germans went on a spending spree following

the conversion of their East German Ostmarks into German marks at a very generous one to one

parity.

One must, however, be careful not to imply causation from what is in fact merely an accounting

identity. Tis is clearly illustrated by comparing the !scal deterioration in the cases of both the United

States and Japan. In the USA the !scal deterioration from 2000 onwards, due to a combination of tax

cuts and a slowing economy, is clearly associated with a widening current account de!cit; while in Japan,

post-1994, there was a signi!cant worsening of the !scal position, accompanied by an improvement in

the Japanese current account! From the mid-1990s, the Japanese !scal position deteriorated noticeably,

but the current account remained in surplus due in part to even higher savings on the part of the

Japanese worried about the e$ects of economic recession. Indeed, from 1998 onwards, as the Japanese

!scal de!cit increased, it seems that Japanese consumers – possibly worried about the implications of

these large !scal de!cits for their prospective future tax liabilities – saved even more, ensuring that the

current account remained in surplus.

Equation (2.3) can be rearranged to yield:

_I_                         - _G_                         - _X_                         - _S_                         - _T_                         - _M_ (2.4)

Tis shows that the equilibrium level of national income is determined where injections (the variables on the

le,-hand side) are equal to leakages (the variables on the right-hand side). Injections are all those factors that

work to raise national income, while leakages are those factors that work to lower national income. Equation

(2.4) is an important identity to which we shall return in Chapter 4.

2.11 OPEN ECONOMY MULTIPLIERS

John Maynard Keynes in his classic work _Te General Teory of Employment, Interest and Money_ published

in 1936 pioneered the use of multiplier analysis to examine the e$ects of changes in government expenditure

and investment on output and employment. However, his work was concerned almost exclusively with a

closed economy. It was not long, however, before the ideas of Keynes' work were applied to an analysis of open

economies, most notably by Fritz Machlup (1943).

Te assumptions underlying basic multiplier analysis are: (1) both domestic prices and the exchange rate

are !xed; (2) the economy is operating at less than full employment so that increases in demand result in an

expansion of output; and (3) the authorities adjust the money supply to changes in money demand by pegging

the domestic interest rate. Tis latter assumption is important: increases in output that lead to a rise in money

demand would, with a !xed money supply, lead to a rise in the domestic interest rate – it is assumed that the

authorities passively expand the money stock to meet any increase in money demand so that interest rates do

not have to change. Tere is no inflation resulting from the money supply expansion because it is merely a

response to the increase in money demand.

Te starting point for the analysis is the identity of equation (2.1), repeated here:

_Y_              - _C_              - � _I_ _G_              - _X_              - _M_ (2.5)

Keynesian analysis proceeds to make assumptions concerning the determinants of the various components of

national income. Government expenditure and exports are assumed to be exogenous, government expenditure

being determined independently by political decision, and exports by foreign expenditure decisions and

foreign income.

We now introduce taxes into the picture. Te simplest way to do this is to assume that taxes are proportional

to income:

_T_ = _tY_ (2.6)

where _t_ is the marginal rate of taxation.

Domestic consumption is partly autonomous and partly determined by the level of disposable national

income, that is, the national income less taxes, i.e. (1 – _t_ ) _Y_ . Tis is denoted algebraically by:

_C_ = _C_ a + _c_ (1– _t_ ) _Y_ (2.7)

where _C_ a is autonomous consumption and _c_ is the marginal propensity to consume, that is, the fraction of any

increase in disposable income that is spent on consumption. In this simple model, consumption is assumed to

56

The Balance of Payments

be a linear function of disposable income. An increase in consumers' disposable income induces an increase

in their consumption.

Import expenditure is assumed to be partly autonomous and partly a positive function of the level of

domestic income:

_M_            - _M_ a            - _mY_ (2.8)

where _M_ a is autonomous import expenditure and _m_ is the marginal propensity to import, that is, the fraction

- f any increase in income that is spent on imports. In this simple formulation import expenditure is assumed
to be a positive linear function of income. Tere are several justi!cations for this. Increased income leads
to increased expenditure on imports, but more domestic production normally requires more imports of
intermediate goods. Since we have assumed that domestic prices are !xed this means that income _Y_ also
represents real income.

If we substitute equations (2.7) and (2.8) into equation (2.5) we obtain:

_Y_ = _C_ a + _c_ (1 – _t_ ) _Y_ + _I_ + _G_ + _X_            - _M_ a – _mY_

Terefore:

_Y_ [1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ) + _m_ ] = _C_ a + _I_ + _G_ + _X_            - _M_ a

Hence we obtain:

1

_Y_             - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )             - _m_ ( _[C]_ _a_             - � _I_ _G_             - _X_             - _Ma_ ) (2.9)

Equation (2.9) can be transformed into di$erence form to yield:

1

d _Y_             - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )             - _m_ (d _Ca_             - d _I_             - d _G_             - d _X_             - d _Ma_ ) (2.10)

where d in front of a variable represents the change in the variable. From equation (2.10) we can obtain some

simple open economy multipliers.

_The government expenditure multiplier_

Te !rst multiplier of interest is the government expenditure multiplier, which shows the increase in national

income resulting from a given increase in government expenditure. Tis is given by:

d _Y_ 1

d _G_                 - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )                 - _m_                 - 0 (2.11)

Equation (2.11) says that an increase in government expenditure will have an expansionary e$etc on national

income, the size of which depends upon the marginal propensity to consume, the tax rate and the marginal

propensity to import.

57

International Finance

Since [1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ) + _m_ ] is less than unity, an increase in government expenditure will result in an even

greater increase in national income. Furthermore, the value of the open economy multiplier is less than the

closed economy multiplier which is given by 1/[1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ )]. Te reason for this is that increased expenditure

is spent on both domestic and foreign goods rather than domestic goods alone, and the expenditure on foreign

goods raises foreign rather than domestic income.

Numerical Example

Assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the tax rate is 25% of income, i.e. _t_ = 0.25, and the

marginal propensity to import is 0.3. Te e$etc of an increase in government expenditure of £100 million on

national income is given by:

1 4286. - £100m - £14 **2** 86. m

- m

Hence, an increase of government expenditure of £100 million will raise eventual national income by £142.86

million. Tis is because 25% of the £100 million increase in income i.e. £25 million will go in income taxes,

leaving £75 million, of which consumers spend £60 million (since marginal propensity to consume is 0.8). Tis

is divided between £30 million on domestic goods and the remaining £30 million of imports (i.e. 0.3 × £100

million), giving a further £30 million increase in incomes, of which 30% will eventually get spent on domestic

goods, giving a further £9 million increase in incomes, of which a further 30%, i.e. £2.7 million, of that gets spent

- n domestic goods and so on. Te summation limit of such a series of expenditure rounds is £142.86 million.

_The foreign trade or export multiplier_

In this simple model, the multiplier e$etc of an increase in exports on national income is identical to that

- f an increase in government expenditure. Tis is given by: d _Y_ /d _X_ =1/[1– _c_ (1– _t_ )+ _m_ ]. In practice, it is o,en
the case that government expenditure tends to be somewhat more biased to domestic output than private
consumption expenditure, implying that the value of _m_ is smaller in the case of the government expenditure
multiplier than in the case of the export multiplier. If this is the case, an increase in government expenditure
will have a more expansionary e$etc on domestic output than an equivalent increase in exports.

Numerical Example

Assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the tax rate is 25% of income, i.e. _t_ = 0.25 and the

marginal propensity to import is 0.3. Te e$etc of an increase in export expenditure of £100 million on

national income is given by

Hence, the e$ect of an increase in exports of £100 million is to boost national income by £142.86 million

which is the same e$etc as an increase in government expenditure of £100 million.

In practice, it is o,en the case that government expenditure tends to be somewhat more biased to domestic

- output than private consumption expenditure, implying that the value of _m_ is smaller in the case of the
government expenditure multiplier than in the case of the export multiplier. If this is the case, an increase in
government expenditure will have a more expansionary e$etc on domestic output than an equivalent increase
in exports.

_The current account multipliers_

Te other relationships of interest are the e$ects of an increase in government expenditure and of exports on

the current account (CA) balance. Rearranging equation (2.5) we have:

_Y_               - _C_               - _I_               - _G_ + _M_               - _X_ = 0

Substituting in equations (2.7) and (2.8) yields:

_Y_                 - _c_ (1                 - _t_ ) _Y_ + _mY_                 - _C_ a + _M_ a                 - _I_                 - _G_                 - _X_ = 0

Hence:

_Y_ [1            - _c_ (1            - _t_ ) + _m_ ]            - _C_ a + _M_ a            - _I_            - _G_            - _X_ = 0

Multiplying by _m_ /[1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ) + _m_ ] yields:

_m_

_mY_          - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )          - _m_ ( _[C]_ _a_          - _Ma_          - � _I_ _G_          - _X_ )          - 0

Adding _M_ a and _X_ to each side, recalling that _M_ = _M_ a + _mY_, and rearranging yields:

_m_

_CA_        - _X_        - _M_        - _X_        - _Ma_        - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )        - _m_ ( _[C]_ _a_        - _Ma_        - � _I_ _G_        - _X_ ) (2.12)

Equation (2.12) can now be expressed in di$erence form as:

_m_

d _CA_          - d _X_          - d _Ma_          - �1 _c_ (1� _t_ )          - _m_ (d _Ca_          - d _Ma_          - d _I_          - d _G_          - d _X_ ) (2.13)

59

International Finance

From equation (2.13) we can derive the e$ects of an increase in government expenditure on the current

account balance which is given by:

_dCA dG_ /            - � _m_ /[1� _c_ (1� _t_ )            - _m_ ]            - 0

Tat is, an increase in government spending leads to a deterioration of the current account balance, which is

some fraction of the initial increase in government expenditure. Tis is because economic agents spend part

- f the increase in income on imports.

Numerical Example

Assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the rate of taxation on income is 25%, i.e. _t_ = 0.25, and

the marginal propensity to import is 0.3. Te e$etc of an increase in government expenditure of £100 million

Tat is, an increase in government expenditure leads to an eventual deterioration in the current account of

£42.86 million. Te reason is that the increased government expenditure of £100 million, because of the open

economy multiplier, increases national income by £142.86 million. Since the marginal propensity to import is

0.3, the £142.86 million increase in income leads to a 0.3 × £142.86m = £42.86m increase in imports, which

corresponds to the deterioration in the current account.

Te other multiplier of interest is the e$etc of an increase in exports on the current balance. Tis is given

by the expression:

Since (1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ))/[1 – _c_ (1 – _t_ ) + _m_ )] is less than unity, an increase in exports leads to an improvement in the

current balance that is less than the original increase in exports. Te explanation for this is that part of the

improvement in the current account resulting from the additional exports is o$set to some extent by increased

expenditure on imports due to the associated rise in the national income.

The Balance of Payments

Numerical Example

Assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the tax rate is 25%, _t_ = 0.25, and the marginal

propensity to import is 0.3. Te e$etc of an increase in exports of £100 million on the current account is given

1 _c_ (1 _t_ ) 1 0 8 1. ( 0 25. )

0 8 1. ( 0 25. )

m £57 14. m

Te explanation is that the £100m increase in exports initially improves the current account by a like amount.

However, it also generates an eventual increase of national income of £142.86 million which induces an

increase in imports of £42.86 million, so the net improvement in the current account is limited to the £100

million increase in exports minus the £42.86 million in imports, giving a net improvement in the current

account of £57.14 million.

Te simple multiplier analysis that we have looked at here shows that Keynesian income e$ects are an

essential part of balance of payments analysis, and that the current account of the balance of payments is an

integral part of macroeconomic equilibrium for an open economy. Another important conclusion is that an

analysis of macroeconomic fluctuations for an open economy requires consideration of what is happening

in foreign economies: increases in foreign income raise the exports and income of the home economy. Te

foreign trade multiplier analysis deals with what happens to the balance of payments when income changes,

assuming that prices are held constant.

2.12 CONCLUSIONS

From the discussion we can see that there are a variety of concepts of balance of payments disequilibrium. Te

very fact that there is no single agreed-upon de!nition is not surprising: the choice of which concept is most

relevant depends upon the exchange rate regime and the particular purpose of the analysis being undertaken.

Each of the concepts has a di$erent information content and, taken together, they provide an important

indicator about the macro-performance of an open economy. In the short run, however, it is inevitable that

the trade and current account balances capture the attention of macroeconomic policy-makers because they

are published so frequently. Furthermore, it is not what happens so much in any given quarter's balance of

payments that is signi!cant, but what the statistics reveal over a period of time about the direction of an

economy.

An important point to be borne in mind is that it is necessary to bring in a time dimension when analysing

balance of payments statistics. A de!cit is not necessarily a bad thing if it is likely to be followed by future

surpluses and vice versa. In this respect, it can be argued that it is necessary to look at the composition of

goods that a country is importing. If the imported goods are predominantly consumer goods like cars and

consumer electronics, then it might be argued that the de!cit is more worrying than when the imports are

plant and machinery that could be important in generating future exports.

61

International Finance

Another point that needs to be borne in mind when considering if a current account de!cit or surplus is a

signi!cant problem is whether or not the country concerned is a net creditor or debtor vis-à-vis the rest of the

world. A current account de!cit means that the country concerned is increasing its indebtedness or reducing

its claims on the rest of the world. If the country is a net creditor it can usually a$ord to do this, whereas if it is

a net debtor the de!cit may be regarded as a more serious problem. Tis is why the de!cits of the United States

have caused some concern because the country has become the world's largest debtor. By contrast, there was

much less concern about the German current account de!cits resulting from German reuni!cation because

past German surpluses have made it a net creditor vis-à-vis the rest of the world.

Another factor to bear in mind when looking at a country's current account position is the potential cause

- f the de!cit or surplus. If a country has a large de!cit due to a large government budget de!cit, then the
remedy may well require reducing government expenditure and/or raising taxes. If, however, the de!cit is due
to high investment, then there is a good chance that future export growth will reduce the de!cit and corrective
policy action may not be necessary. Alternatively, the current account de!cit may be due to a consumer
boom (reflected in low savings), so a tightening of monetary policy in the form of higher interest rates may
be needed. In any case, some sort of analysis of causes is crucial to appraising whether a de!cit or surplus is
a policy problem.

Finally, when analysing a country's balance of payments statistics and attempting to assess whether the

country is facing or is likely to face problems in the near future, it is important to remember that whatever

concept of balance of payments disequilibrium is used it gives only a partial view of the economy. If a country

has a current account de!cit, high inflation and low economic growth, then the balance of payments problem

is more worrying than if the de!cit is accompanied by high economic growth and low inflation.

3.1 INTRODUCTION

In the opening two chapters we have introduced the exchange rate and the balance of payments. In this

chapter, we will investigate the relationship between the exchange rate and the balance of payments. In

particular, we shall be studying two models that investigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the

current account position of a country. Tese two approaches are popularly known as the 'elasticity approach'

and the 'absorption approach'. Both models were designed to tackle one of the most important questions in

international economics – will a devaluation (or depreciation) of the exchange rate lead to a reduction of

a current account de!cit? Te answer to this question is of crucial importance because if an exchange rate

change cannot be relied upon to ensure adjustment of the current account, then policy-makers will have to

rely on other instruments to improve the position.

We will start the chapter by examining the impact of exchange rate changes according to the elasticity

approach which looks at the impact of exchange rate changes, assuming domestic and foreign prices are

!xed. Tis is followed by an analysis of the absorption model which examines the e$ects of the exchange rate

in terms of its impact on domestic income and spending. We will conclude by analysing the similarities and

di$erences between the two models. For simplicity, throughout this chapter we shall ignore the complications

- f unilateral transfers and interest, pro!t and dividends on the current account balance and concentrate on
the export and import of goods and services. _Troughout this chapter, the exchange rate is defined as domestic_
_currency units per unit of foreign currency, so that a devaluation/depreciation of the currency is represented by_
_a rise in the exchange rate_ .

3.2 THE ELASTICITY APPROACH TO THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

Te elasticity approach to the balance of payments provides an analysis of what happens to the current

account balance when a country devalues its currency. Te analysis was pioneered by Alfred Marshall (1923)

and Abba Lerner (1944), and later extended by Joan Robinson (1937) and Fritz Machlup (1939). At the outset,

the model makes some simplifying assumptions: it focuses on demand conditions and assumes that the supply

elasticities for the domestic export good and foreign import good are perfectly elastic, so that changes in

demand volumes have no e$ect on prices. In e$etc, these assumptions mean that domestic and foreign prices

are !xed so that changes in relative prices are caused by changes in the nominal exchange rate.

Te central message of the elasticity approach is that there are two direct e$ects of a devaluation on the

current balance, one of which works to reduce a de!cit, whilst the other actually contributes to making the

de!cit worse than before. Let us consider these two e$ects in some detail.

Te current account balance, when expressed in terms of the domestic currency, is given by:

_CA_ = _P_ _X_ v – _S_ _P_             - _M_ v (3.1)

where _P_ is the domestic price level, _X_ v is the volume of domestic exports, _S_ is the exchange rate (domestic

currency units per unit of foreign currency), _P_ - is the foreign price level and _M_ v is the volume of imports.

We shall set the domestic and foreign price levels at unity; the value of domestic exports ( _P X_ v) is given by _X_,

while the foreign currency value of imports ( _P_ - _M_ v) is given by _M_ . Using these simpli!cations equation (3.1)

becomes:

_CA_ = _X_              - _S_ _M_ (3.2)

In di$erence form equation (3.2) becomes:

dCA = d _X_                - _S_ d _M_                - _M_ d _S_ (3.3)

Dividing equation (3.3) by the change in the exchange rate d _S_, we obtain:

d

_CA_ d _X_ d d

At this point we introduce two de!nitions. First, the price elasticity of demand for exports ( _x_ is de!ned as the

percentage change in exports over the percentage change in price as represented by the percentage change in

the exchange rate, giving:

d _X_ / X

_S S_

so that

d _X_ - [�] _[x S]_ d _X_ (3.5)

Elasticity and Absorption Approaches to the Balance of Payments

Second, the price elasticity of demand for imports ( _m_ is de!ned as the percentage change in imports over

the percentage change in their price as represented by the percentage change in the exchange rate (we place a

negative as we wish to express elasticity as a positive number):

d _M M_ /

                - _m_                

d / _S S_

so that

_m SM_ d

d _M_                  - � [�] (3.6)

Substituting equations (3.5) and (3.6) into equation (3.4) we obtain:

d _CA_

and dividing by _M_

_CA_ 1 _xX_

   - [�] _m_    - 1

d _S M_

_xX_

- [�] - � _m_ - 1 (3.7)
_SM_

Assuming that we initially have balanced trade, _X_ / _SM_ = 1, and rearranging equation (3.7) yields:

d

 - _M_ (��� _x_ _m_  - 1) (3.8)
_S_

_CA_

  - _M_ (��� _x_ _m_  - 1)

d _S_

Equation (3.8) is known as the Marshall–Lerner condition and states that, starting from a position of

equilibrium in the current account, a devaluation will improve the current account, that is, d _CA_ /d _S_ - 0 only

if the sum of the foreign elasticity of demand for exports and the home country elasticity of demand for

imports is greater than unity; that is, ( _x_ + ( _m_ >1. If the sum of these two elasticities is less than unity, then a

devaluation will lead to a deterioration of the current account.

Te economic explanation of this result is illustrated in Table 3.1 which shows the pre-devaluation and

three possible post-devaluation scenarios. Before devaluation the sterling–dollar exchange rate is £0.6667/\$1

(\$1.5/£1), whereas a,er the devaluation it is £0.80/$1 ($1.25/£1). Te price of one unit of UK exports is £1 and

the price of one unit of US exports is \$5.

Tere are two e$ects in play once a currency is devalued:

1. **Te price effect**   - exports become cheaper measured in foreign currency: a UK export earns only

\$1.25 post-devaluation compared to \$1.50 prior to devaluation. Imports become more expensive

measured in the home currency, each unit of imports costs £3.33 prior to the devaluation but

costs £4 post-devaluation. Te price e$etc clearly contributes to a worsening of the UK current

account.

65

International Finance

2. **Te volume effect**   - the fact that exports become cheaper should encourage an increased volume

	- f exports, and the fact that imports become more expensive should lead to a decreased volume of
imports. Te volume e$etc clearly contributes to improving the current balance.

Te net e$ect depends upon whether the price or volume e$etc dominates. In Table 3.1 case 1, the increase in

export volumes and decrease in import volumes are not sufficient to outweigh the fact that less is received for

exports and more has to be paid for imports. Te result is that the current account balance moves from balance

into de!cit. Approximate elasticities sum to 0.45. In case 2, the increased export volumes and decreased volume

- f imports exactly match the decreased earnings per unit of exports and increased expenditure per unit of
imports so that the current balance is unchanged. Approximate elasticities sum to 1.08 which is close to unity.
In case 3, the increased volume of export sales and decreased volume of imports are sufficient to outweigh
the price e$ects so that the current balance improves following a devaluation. Approximate elasticities sum to
1.60 which ful!ls the critical Marshall–Lerner condition for a successful devaluation.

A more complicated formula can be derived which allows for supply elasticities of exports and imports

- f less than in!nity. Given the assumption of less-than-in!nite supply elasticity conditions, and assuming
initially balanced trade, Stern (1973, pp. 64–7) has shown that a more complicated condition needs to be
satis!ed; namely, the balance of payments will improve following a devaluation if:

Elasticity and Absorption Approaches to the Balance of Payments

where . _x_ is the domestic supply elasticity of the export good and . _m_ is the foreign supply elasticity for its export

good (the domestic country's imports). Te e$etc of less-than-in!nite supply price elasticities is to make the

required demand elasticities less stringent in the sense that the current account may improve even if the sum

- f the demand elasticities is less than unity. If the supply price elasticities of exports and imports are less than
in!nite, an increase in demand for exports will lead to some rise in the domestic price of exports which will
give an additional boost to export revenues (when demand is inelastic). Similarly, the fall in the demand for
foreign imports will have the e$ect of reducing the foreign currency price of imports, thus lowering import
expenditure. Both these e$ects are absent under the in!nite supply elasticities we have assumed.

3.3 EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON IMPORT AND EXPORT DEMAND ELASTICITIES

Te possibility that a devaluation may lead to a worsening rather than an improvement in the balance of

payments led to much research into empirical estimates of the elasticity of demand for exports and imports.

Economists were divided into two camps: those popularly known as 'elasticity optimists' who believed that the

sum of these two elasticities tended to exceed unity, and those known as 'elasticity pessimists' who believed that

these elasticities tended to less than unity. It was argued that a devaluation may work better for industrialized

countries than for developing ones. Many developing countries are heavily dependent upon imports, and

their price elasticity of demand for imports was likely to be very low, while for industrialized countries that

have to face competitive export markets the price elasticity of demand for their exports may be quite elastic.

Te implication of the Marshall–Lerner condition was that devaluation may be a cure for some countries'

balance of payments de!cits but not for others.

Tere are enormous problems involved in estimating the elasticity of demand for imports and exports. A

summary by Gylfason (1987) of ten econometric studies undertaken between 1969 and 1981 has shown that

the Marshall–Lerner condition was ful!lled for all of the 15 industrial and 9 developing countries surveyed.

Te results are shown in Table 3.2. They are based on estimates of the elasticities over a twoto three-year time

horizon. As such, while the table demonstrates clearly that a devaluation will improve the current account

- ver such a time span, it does not preclude an initial J-curve e$etc. Indeed, a study by Artus and Knight
(1984) has shown that, up to a period of six months, estimated price elasticities are invariably so low that
the Marshall–Lerner conditions are not ful!lled. Hooper et al. (1998) examine the shortand long-run price
elasticities of demand for imports and exports of the G7 countries from the mid-1950s through to the end of
1996. Te total (import and export demand elasticities) for the short and long run respectively were: Canada
(0.6, 1.8), France (0.2, 0.6), Germany (0.3, 0.4), Italy (0.3, 1.3), Japan (0.6, 1.3), the United Kingdom (0.2, 2.2)
and the United States (0.6, 1.8). Te results show the di$erence between shortand long-run elasticities and
show clearly that in the short run the Marshall–Lerner condition does not hold, though in the longer run it is
generally met (except in the cases of France and Germany).

A general consensus accepted by most economists is that elasticities are lower in the short run than in the

long run, in which case the Marshall–Lerner conditions may not hold in the short run but may hold in the

medium to long run. Goldstein and Kahn (1985) in an excellent survey of the empirical literature conclude

that, in general, long-run elasticities (greater than two years) are approximately twice as great as short-run

elasticities (0–6 months). Further, the short-run elasticities generally fail to sum to unity, while the long-run

elasticities almost always sum to greater than unity.

Te possibility that in the short run the Marshall–Lerner condition may not be ful!lled, although generally

holding over the longer run, leads to the phenomenon of what is popularly known as the J-curve e$etc, which

is illustrated in Figure 3.1.

Te idea underlying the J-curve e$ect is that in the short run export volumes and import volumes do

not change much so that the country receives less export revenue and spends more on imports, leading to a

deterioration in the current balance. However, a,er a time lag export volumes start to increase and import

volumes start to decline, and consequently the current de!cit starts to improve and eventually moves into

surplus. Te issue then is whether the initial deterioration in the current account is less than the future

improvement so that, overall, devaluation can be said to work. Krugman (1991), in an analysis of the e$ects of

time

**Figure 3.1** Te J-curve e$etc

a sharp depreciation of the US dollar during 1985–87, found a J-curve e$etc for the US current account: the

de!cit initially rose in both absolute terms and as a percentage of US gross national product, but a,er a lag

- f approximately two years it improved with long-run elasticities for imports and exports summing to 1.9 in
excess of that required by the Marshall–Lerner condition.

Tere have been numerous reasons advanced to explain the slow responsiveness of export and import

volumes in the short run and why the response is far greater in the longer run; three of the most important are:

 - **A time lag in consumer responses.** It takes time for consumers in both the devaluing country and the
rest of the world to respond to the changed competitive situation. Switching away from foreign imported
goods to domestically produced goods inevitably takes some time because consumers will be worried
about issues other than the price change, such as the reliability and reputation of domestically produced
goods as compared to the foreign imports. On the other hand, foreign consumers may be reluctant to
switch away from domestically produced goods towards the exports of the devaluing country.

 - **A time lag in producer responses.** Even though a devaluation improves the competitive position of
exports, it will take time for domestic producers to expand production of exportables. In addition,
the orders for imports are normally made well in advance and such contracts are not readily cancelled
in the short run. Factories will be reluctant to cancel orders for vital inputs and raw materials. For
example, the waiting list for a Boeing aeroplane can be over !ve years; it is most unlikely that a
British airline will cancel the order just because the pound has been devalued. Also, the payments for
many imports will have been hedged against exchange risk in the forward market and so will be le,
una$ected by the devaluation.

 - **Imperfect competition.** Building up a share of foreign markets can be a time-consuming and costly
business. Tis being the case, foreign exporters may be very reluctant to lose their market share
in the devaluing country and might respond to the loss in their competitiveness by reducing their
export prices. To the extent that they do this, the rise in the cost of imports caused by the devaluation

69

International Finance

will be partly o$set. Similarly, industries competing against foreign imports may react to the threat

    - f increased exports by the devaluing country by reducing prices in their home markets, limiting

the amount of additional exports by the devaluing country. Tese e$ects rely upon some degree of

imperfect competition which gives foreign !rms some super-normal pro!t margins enabling them

to reduce their prices. If foreign !rms were in a highly competitive environment they would only be

making normal pro!ts and so would be unable to reduce their prices.

In addition to the above e$ects it is unlikely that the price of exports as measured in the domestic prices will

remain !xed. Many imports are used as inputs for exporting industries and the increased price of imports may

lead to higher wage costs as workers seek compensation for higher import prices, which will to some extent

lead to a rise in export prices, reducing the competitive advantage of the devaluation.

3.4 THE PASS-THROUGH EFFECT OF A DEPRECIATION OR APPRECIATION

In the preceding analysis, we have assumed that a 10% depreciation/devaluation will lead to a rise in price of

imports by 10%. In the real world this might not be valid, and economists use the term 'pass-through e$ect’ to

describe the extent to which a 1% depreciation (appreciation) leads to a rise (fall) in import prices. If there is

complete pass-through, a 10% depreciation (appreciation) of the currency leads to a 10% rise (fall) in import

prices. If, however, a 10% depreciation (appreciation) leads to only a 6% rise (fall) in import prices, then there

is only a partial pass-through e$etc, with the elasticity of exchange rate pass-through being 0.6. Tere are

numerous reasons advanced as to why an _x_ % depreciation of the exchange rate may lead to a less than _x_ % rise

in prices in the short run. As noted previously, in a world of imperfect competition foreign !rms may not be

prepared to risk losing market share following a depreciation and decide to absorb part of the depreciation

by reducing their foreign currency price of exports so that the price rise following the devaluation will be less

than the _x_ % devaluation. Tis may be a sensible strategy since !rms may hesitate to risk losing market share

following what might be a temporary depreciation in the exchange rate. Similarly, if a currency appreciates,

foreign !rms may decide not to change their local currency prices since they will be able to increase their

pro!ts as measured in their local currency without having to invest to increase physical shipments to the

country for what might be only a transitory appreciation.

A paper by Yang (1997), who studied a selection of 77 manufacturing industries in the United States for

the period December 1980 until December 1991, found that the elasticity of pass-through was 0.3185 for one

quarter of a year, suggesting that a 10% depreciation of the dollar leads to a rise in import prices of 3.185%

- n average. However, there was quite a bit of dispersion between di$erent industries with the elasticity of
pass-through being only 0.025 in hardwood veneer and plywood and 0.757 in printing trade machinery.
As the time horizon increased, however, in all industries the elasticity of pass-through increased and o,en
approached unity. One of the key factors determining the elasticity of pass-through is the degree of product
di$erentiation: the greater that this is, then the greater is the ability of foreign exporters to raise their prices,
presumably because !rms in industries where the product is di$erentiated tend to face more price-inelastic
demand for their product and so are able to pass on price rises with less fear of losing sales. In a study by
Klitgaard (1999), looking at US imports from Japan in four major export industries (industrial machinery,
transportations equipment, electrical machinery and precision equipment) during the 1990s, it was found
that when the dollar depreciated by 10% then the price of Japanese imports rose by only 6%, suggesting that
Japanese exporters take a 4% o$setting change in their pro!t margin on exports in the short run.

To the extent that there is only a partial pass-through e$ect on the price of imports in the short run,

the e$etc will be to dampen the size and complicate the dynamics and timing of the J-curve e$etc. Tis is

70

Elasticity and Absorption Approaches to the Balance of Payments

because imports will not rise in price as much as suggested by the devaluation, which will tend to reduce

import expenditure compared to complete pass-through in the very short run. However, as the exchange rate

depreciation is increasingly passed on over time, this will tend to raise import expenditure, so prolonging the

initial deterioration of the J-curve.

3.5 THE ABSORPTION APPROACH

One of the major defects of the elasticity approach is that it is based upon the assumption that all other things

are equal. However, changes in export and import volumes will by de!nition have implications for national

income, and consequently income e$ects need to be incorporated in a more comprehensive analysis of the

e$ects of a devaluation. Alexander (1952) is one of the most important papers to evaluate this e$etc, focusing

- n the fact that a current account imbalance can be viewed as the di$erence between domestic output and
domestic spending (absorption).

Taking the equation for national income:

_Y_ = _C_ + _I_ + _G_ + _X_              - _M_ (3.10)

and de!ning domestic absorption as _A_ = _C_ + I + _G_, equation (3.10) can be rearranged as follows:

_CA_ = _X_             - _M_ = _Y_             - _A_ (3.11)

Equation (3.11) says that the current balance represents the di$erence between domestic output and domestic

absorption. A current account surplus means that domestic output exceeds domestic spending, while a

current account de!cit means that domestic output is less than domestic spending. Transforming equation

(3.11) into di$erence form yields:

d _CA_ = d _Y_                 - d _A_ (3.12)

What equation (3.12) implies is that the e$ects of a devaluation on the current balance will depend upon

how it a$ects national income relative to how it a$ects domestic absorption. If a devaluation raises domestic

income relative to domestic spending this current account improves. If, however, devaluation raises domestic

absorption relative to domestic income, the current account deteriorates. Understanding how devaluation

a$ects both income and absorption is therefore central to the absorption approach to balance of payments

analysis.

Absorption can be divided up into two parts: (i) a rise in income will lead to an increase in absorption

which is determined by the marginal propensity to absorb, denoted by _a_ ; (ii) there will also be a 'direct e$ect'

- n absorption, which is all the other e$ects on absorption resulting from devaluation, denoted by Ad. Tus the
change in total absorption d _A_, is given by:

d _A_                 - _a Y_ d                 - d _Ad_ (3.13)

Substituting (3.13) into equation (3.12) yields:

d _CA_                - (1 a� )d _Y_                - d _Ad_ (3.14)

71

International Finance

Equation (3.14) reveals that there are three factors that need to be examined when considering the impact

- f devaluation. A devaluation can a$ect the current balance only by: changing the marginal propensity to
absorb, _a_ ; changing the level of income, d _Y_ ; and by a$ecting direct absorption, d _A_ d. Te condition for a
devaluation to improve the current account is (1 – _a_ )d _Y_ - d _A_ d, that is, any change in income not spent on
absorption must exceed any change in direct absorption.

To consider whether the above condition is likely to be ful!lled it is worth distinguishing two possible

states of an economy: below full employment, so that income may rise; and full employment, so that national

income cannot rise.

3.6 THE EFFECTS OF A DEVALUATION ON NATIONAL INCOME

Clearly a relevant question if the economy is at less than full employment is whether a devaluation is likely to

raise or lower national income. If the marginal propensity to absorb is less than unity then a rise in income will

raise the income to absorption ratio and so improve the current account. On the other hand, if income were

to fall this would raise the absorption to income ratio (as absorption would fall by less than income) which

would worsen the current account. Tere are two important e$ects on income that need to be examined: the

employment e$etc and the terms of trade e$etc:

 - **Employment effect.** If the economy is at less than full employment, then, providing the Marshall–
Lerner condition is ful!lled, there will be an increase in net exports following a devaluation which
will lead to an increase in national income via the foreign trade multiplier. However, if the Marshall–
Lerner condition is not ful!lled, then net exports would fall, implying that national income falls.
Hence, it is not clear whether the employment e$etc will raise or lower national income.

 - **Terms of trade effect.** Te terms of trade are the price of exports divided by the price of imports,
expressed algebraically as:

Price of exports

Price of imports [=] _[ P]_ _SP*_

where _P_ is the domestic price index, _P_ - is the foreign price index and _S_ is the exchange rate (domestic currency

units per unit of foreign currency).

A devaluation (a rise in _S_ ) tends to make imports more expensive in domestic currency terms, which

is not matched by a corresponding rise in export prices; this means that the terms of trade deteriorate.

A deterioration in the terms of trade represents a loss of real national income because more units of

exports have to be given to obtain a unit of imports. Hence, the terms of trade effect lowers national

income.

Overall, the e$ects of a devaluation on the income of the devaluing country are ambiguous. Even if there

are increased net exports earnings (which relies on the Marshall–Lerner condition being ful!lled) the negative

terms of trade e$etc works to reduce national income.

Even if income rises overall, it is still not clear what the implications of a rise in income are for the current

account, as this will depend upon the value of the marginal propensity to absorb. If this is less than unity then

an increase in income generated by the increase in net exports leads to an improvement in the current account

because income rises by more than absorption. If, however, the marginal propensity to absorb is greater than

72

Elasticity and Absorption Approaches to the Balance of Payments

unity then the increased income would lead to an even bigger rise in absorption, resulting in a worsening

- f the current account. Although one may think that the marginal propensity to absorb will be less than
unity this need not be the case. Alexander (1952) speculated that unemployed workers who obtain jobs are
likely to have a high propensity to consume and that an increase in income may well stimulate a great deal of
investment. Workers who obtain jobs may well decide to spend more than their income by borrowing against
future prospective income. Similarly, as the economy expands, !rms' expenditure may exceed their revenues
as they undertake signi!cant investment in the expectation of high future pro!ts. Hence, it is conceivable in
the short run that the marginal propensity to absorb could be greater than unity, so that a rise in income leads
to a deterioration in the current account.

Of course, if the economy is at a position of full employment, an increase in income is not possible. In this

instance, for a devaluation to improve the current de!cit, a reduction in direct absorption would be required.

But income changes are only one of the factors influencing the current account: the other e$etc that we need

to consider is the impact on direct absorption.

3.7 THE EFFECTS OF A DEVALUATION ON DIRECT ABSORPTION

For the moment, let us assume that the net e$ect of a devaluation on income is zero. Tis being the case, we

must consider the e$etc of the devaluation on direct absorption. If the devaluation reduces direct absorption,

then it will lead to an improvement in the current balance, whereas if it increases then the e$etc on the current

balance will lead to a deterioration of the current account. Let us now consider possible ways in which a

devaluation can be expected to impact upon direct absorption.

_Real balance effect_

A simple formulation of the demand to hold money is that it is a demand to hold real money balances.

If prices double then agents will demand twice as much money as before. Algebraically a money demand

function can be expressed as:

_M P_ / I [��] _[k]_ (3.15)

where _k_ is some constant and _P_ I is an aggregate price index de!ned as:

_P_ I [��]               - _P_               - (1 ��) _SP_               - (3.16)

where + is the percentage of expenditure on domestic goods, _P_ is the price of the domestic good, _P_ - is the price

- f the foreign import good, and _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign

currency.

For example, assume that the price of the domestic good, _P_, is £1, while the price of the foreign good, _P_ *,

is \$5, and the pre-devaluation exchange rate is £0.6667/\$1. If domestic consumers spend 70% of their money

- n domestic goods, + = 0.7, then the average price level is:

_P_ I�� 0.7 £1 0.3�            - �            - ��$5 £0.6667 /$1�            -            - �£1.70

73

International Finance

If the pound is devalued to £0.8/\$1 then the average price level becomes:

_P_ I             - 0.7 £1��             - ��0.3�� $5 £0.8 /$1�             - ���£1.90

Hence, a 20% devaluation of the pound will raise the average price index facing UK consumers by approximately

11.8%.

Given an unchanged money stock and the assumption that economic agents aim to maintain a given

amount of real money balances as depicted in equation (3.15), then a devaluation (rise in _S_ ) by raising the

- verall price index in equation (3.16) means that economic agents have to maintain their real balances by
cutting down on direct absorption. They will attempt to increase their money balances by selling bonds, which
pushes down the price of bonds and raises the domestic interest rate. Te rise in interest rates will reduce
investment and consumption, so reducing direct absorption.

For the real balance e$ect to come into play, it must be emphasized that the authorities must not

accommodate the increased money demand by increasing the money supply in line with the increased money

demand. If they raise the money supply, this would leave the ratio _M_ / _P_ I constant so that the real balance e$etc

will not come into play.

_Income redistribution effect_

Te rise in the general price index (equation 3.16) resulting from a devaluation is likely to have a number of

e$ects on the income distribution. To the extent that it redistributes income from those with a low marginal

propensity to absorb to those with a high marginal propensity to absorb, an increase in direct absorption will

follow. On the other hand, to the extent that the reverse is true, a lowering in direct absorption will follow. A

few possibilities in this respect are:

 - Te rise in the general price index will tend to reduce the real income of those with !xed incomes,
but if overall income is unchanged then those with variable incomes will have gained. It tends to be
the case that the group on !xed incomes are the poor who have a high propensity to absorb, while
those on variable incomes are better o$ and have a lower propensity to absorb. To the extent that
income is redistributed from those with !xed incomes to those with variable incomes, this income
redistribution e$etc will tend to reduce direct absorption.

 - A devaluation o,en leads to an improvement of company pro!ts through increased sales in exportand import-competing industries, while real wages are reduced by the rise in the aggregate price
index and take time to catch up. Te e$etc on direct absorption of this redistribution is not clear:
though !rms may have a lower tendency to absorb than workers, this will be very much dependent

	- n their expectations about the future. If these expectations are very favourable then the devaluation
and pro!ts rise may stimulate investment and even raise direct absorption.

 - Tere may be considerable income adjustments within groups of companies and workers. Some
companies' pro!ts will bene!t from a devaluation as export sales rise; however, some !rms that are
reliant on imported inputs may !nd that the cost increases reduce their pro!t margins. Similarly,
some workers will be able to protect themselves against the induced price rise because they are
represented by strong trade unions, while others with no union representation may not secure

74

Elasticity and Absorption Approaches to the Balance of Payments

compensating rises. Te overall e$etc on direct absorption will then depend on whether the

companies and workers that gain have a higher propensity to absorb than those that lose.

Overall, it is extremely difficult to say whether the income redistribution e$ects will raise or lower direct

absorption.

_Money illusion effect_

It is possible that, even though prices rise because of the devaluation, consumers su$er ‘money illusion’ and

buy exactly the same bundle of goods as before, even though their real spending power has been reduced. If

this is the case they are actually spending more on direct absorption than before. However, the money illusion

e$etc may work in reverse and consumers, because of the price rises, may actually decide to cut back direct

absorption more than is proportionate to the price rise so that direct absorption falls. Whichever way the

money illusion e$etc works it is unlikely to be very signi!cant and is most probably only a temporary rather

than a permanent factor.

_Expectational effects_

It is possible that economic agents regard the price rises induced by devaluation as likely to spark further

price rises. Tis would lead to an increase in direct absorption which would worsen the balance of payments.

However, against this it can be argued that inflationary expectations may reduce investment which lowers

direct absorption.

_Laursen–Metzler effect_

Laursen and Metzler (1950) noted that the deterioration in the terms of trade following a devaluation will

have two e$ects on absorption: an income e$etc and a substitution e$etc. While the deterioration in the terms

- f trade lowers national income and thereby income-related absorption, it also makes domestically produced
goods relatively cheaper compared to foreign produced goods, which implies a substitution e$etc in favour

- f increased consumption of domestically produced goods. If the positive substitution e$ect outweighs the
negative income e$etc, Laursen–Metzler noted that a devaluation which results in a deterioration of the terms

- f trade could actually lead to a rise in absorption.

Hence, the e$ects of a devaluation on direct absorption are ambiguous. While the real money balance

e$etc works to lower direct absorption, all the other e$ects may raise or lower direct absorption. Since we

do not know whether the marginal propensity to absorb is greater or less than unity, if income rises or falls,

nor whether direct absorption rises or falls, the e$ects of a devaluation are indeterminate. Indeed, the picture

will become much more complex once it is recognized that all the di$ering e$ects take place at di$erent

speeds over time and that some e$ects will be more signi!cant in certain economies than in others. Overall,

the approach suggests that a devaluation will have many diverse and o,en conflicting e$ects on the current

account.

Nonetheless, the absorption approach has some important lessons for policy-makers. Its central message

is that raising domestic income relative to domestic absorption will improve the current account balance. In

this respect, a devaluation is more likely to succeed if it is accompanied by economic policy measures that

concentrate on raising income while constraining absorption.

3.8 A SYNTHESIS OF THE ELASTICITY AND ABSORPTION APPROACHES

Initially, it was believed that the absorption approach was an alternative to the elasticities approach; the

elasticity approach concentrating on price e$ects while the absorption approach concentrated on income

e$ects. However, authors such as Tsiang (1961) and Alexander (1959) showed that the two models are not

substitutes; rather they are complementary.

To understand this complementarity, consider the e$ects of a devaluation on income. Exports will increase

more than imports, so raising income only if the Marshall–Lerner elasticities condition is ful!lled. If the

Marshall–Lerner condition is not ful!lled, then exports will rise by less than imports, implying that income

will fall. Hence, the Marshall–Lerner condition is clearly relevant to the absorption approach. Similarly,

when account is taken of income e$ects the necessary elasticity condition for a devaluation to improve the

current balance is a$ected. Tis is because if the elasticities sum to greater than unity, so that there is an initial

improvement in the current balance, this improvement leads to an increase in income which induces a larger

increase in imports than in the absence of such an income e$etc. For this reason, the initial improvement in

the current account has to be more pronounced than in the absence of such income e$ects. Tis implies that

the sum of elasticities needs to be somewhat greater than the unity value derived from the elasticity approach.

Tus, the absorption approach is relevant to the elasticity approach.

3.9 CONCLUSIONS

We have seen that the absorption approach, like the elasticity approach, does not provide an unambiguous

answer to the question of whether a devaluation leads to an improvement in the current account. At issue

is how economic agents respond to the change in relative prices that is implied by a devaluation. Te two

analyses are not alternative theories, but rather provide complementary insights into the processes at work.

Although the two models are comparatively static in nature, they both point to the importance of dynamic

forces and a time dimension to the eventual outcome. Demand elasticities are higher in the long run than in

the short run, leading to a possible J-curve e$ect and the e$ects of a devaluation on income and absorption

being spread over time. Even in these simple models, it is seen that there are likely to be a variety of forces at

work. No doubt even greater ambiguity would emerge as a result of including time lags, wealth e$ects and an

explicit treatment of expectations.

Despite their simplistic assumptions, ambiguous conclusions and de!ciencies, the two approaches have

remained influential because they contain clear and useful messages for policy-makers. A devaluation is more

likely to succeed when elasticities of demand for imports and exports are high and when it is accompanied by

measures such as !scal and monetary restraint that boost income relative to domestic absorption.

Te overwhelming weight of empirical estimates suggests that at time horizons of two years and above

the Marshall–Lerner conditions are ful!lled, implying that exchange rate adjustments are an influential tool

in eliminating current account de!cits. One should not expect a devaluation to work in the same manner

for all countries. Te e$ects of a devaluation will be determined in part by whether or not the economy

is at or below full employment and in part on the structural parameters of the particular economy under

consideration. Finally, it should be remembered that both models assume that foreign countries do not react

to the competitive advantage gained by the devaluing country. To the extent that they react by devaluing their

currencies, an undermining of the e$ectiveness of a devaluation policy will result.

4.1 INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 3 we looked at some of the fundamental identities for an open economy and considered the

possible e$ect of devaluation on the current account. It was noted that the ultimate impact of a devaluation

will in large part be dependent upon the economic policies that accompany the devaluation. In this chapter

we shall be examining how both exchange rate changes and macroeconomic policies impact upon an open

economy. A fundamental di$erence between an open economy and a closed economy is that over time a

country has to ensure that there is an approximate balance in its current account. Tis is because no country

can continuously build up a stock of net liabilities to the rest of the world by running a continuous current

account de!cit. Conversely, it does not make sense for a surplus country to continuously build up a stock of

net claims on the rest of the world. Eventually it will wish to spend those claims.

Te need for economic policy-makers to pay attention to the implications of changes in monetary and !scal

policy on the balance of payments is an important additional dimension for consideration in the formulation

- f economic policy in an open economy. Ensuring a sustainable balance of payments position over time is an
important economic objective to go along with those like high economic growth, low unemployment and low
inflation.

One of the additional policy choices that has to be made by the authorities of an open economy is to decide

whether to !x the exchange rate, allow it to float or perhaps choose some arrangement between these two

extremes. Te choice between these two regimes is the focus of analysis in Chapter 10; in this chapter we

concentrate upon how !scal and monetary policy operate under both regimes.

4.2 THE PROBLEM OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL BALANCE

To appreciate the development of the post-war literature on open economies, readers need to bear in mind

that between 1948 and 1973 the international monetary system was one of !xed exchange rates, with the

major currencies being pegged to the US dollar. Only in cases of 'fundamental disequilibrium' were authorities

allowed to devalue or revalue their currencies. Tis meant that there was considerable interest in the relative

e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policies as a means of influencing the economy. Although economic

policy-makers generally have many macroeconomic aims, the discussion in the 1950s and 1960s was primarily

concerned with two objectives. Te principal goal was one of achieving full employment for the labour force

along with a stable level of prices, which may be termed 'internal balance'. Although governments were

generally committed to achieving full employment it is widely recognized that expanding output in an open

economy will have implications for the balance of payments. For instance, expanding output and employment

will result in greater expenditure on imports and consequently lead to a deterioration of the current account.

As authorities had agreed to maintain !xed exchange rates, they were interested in running an equilibrium in

the balance of payments, that is, in balancing the supply and demand for their currency. Tis latter objective

can be termed external balance.

Changes in !scal and monetary policies which aim to influence the level of aggregate demand in the

economy are termed 'expenditure changing' policies. On the other hand, policies such as devaluation/

revaluation of the exchange rate, which attempt to influence the composition of spending between domestic

and foreign goods, are known as 'expenditure switching' policies.

Much of the 1950s and 1960s literature was concerned with how the authorities might simultaneously

achieve both internal and external balance. Te policy problem of achieving both internal and external

balance was conceptualized by Trevor Swan (1955) in what is known as the Swan diagram, which is illustrated

in Figure 4.1. On the vertical axis is the real exchange rate, de!ned as domestic currency units per unit

- f foreign currency, so that a rise represents a real depreciation, which implies improved international
competitiveness. On the horizontal axis we have the amount of real domestic absorption, which represents
the sum of consumption, investment and government expenditure.

Te internal balance (IB) schedule represents combinations of the real exchange rate and domestic

absorption for which the economy is in internal balance, that is, full employment with stable prices. It is

downward-sloping from le, to right. Tis is because an appreciation (fall) of the real exchange rate will

reduce exports and increase imports; therefore to maintain full employment it is necessary for there to be

an increase in domestic expenditure. To the right of the IB schedule there are inflationary pressures in the

economy because for a given exchange rate domestic expenditure is greater than that required to produce full

employment, while to the le, there are deflationary pressures because expenditure is short of that required to

maintain full employment.

Te external balance (EB) schedule shows combinations of the real exchange rate and domestic absorption

for which the economy is in external balance, that is, equilibrium in the current account. It is upward-sloping

from le, to right. Tis is because a depreciation of the exchange rate will increase exports and reduce imports;

so to prevent the current account moving into surplus requires increased domestic expenditure to induce

an o$setting increase in imports. To the right of the EB schedule domestic expenditure is greater than that

required for current account equilibrium, so the result is a current account de!cit, while to the le, there is a

current account surplus.

Hence, the Swan diagram is divided into four zones depicting di$erent possible states for an economy:

 Zone 1: a de!cit and inflationary pressures;

 Zone 2: a de!cit and deflationary pressures;

 Zone 3: a surplus and deflationary pressures;

 Zone 4: a surplus and inflationary pressures.

Only at point A, where the IB and EB schedules intersect, is the economy in both internal and external

equilibrium. Suppose that the economy for some reason !nds itself at point B in zone 1, experiencing both

inflationary pressures and a current account de!cit. If the authorities maintain a !xed exchange rate and

try to reduce the current account de!cit by cutting back real domestic expenditure they will move the

economy towards point C; while to achieve external balance by using expenditure-reducing policies alone

would require such a cut-back in absorption that the economy would su$er and be pushed into recession

with resulting unemployment. Alternatively, the authorities might try to tackle the de!cit by devaluing the

exchange rate, which has the e$etc of moving the economy towards point D on the EB schedule. While the

devaluation has the e$etc of reducing the current account de!cit it does so at the expense of adding further

inflationary pressures to the economy. Tis is shown by the fact that the economy moves further away from

the IB schedule.

A major lesson of this simple model is that the use of one instrument, be it !scal policy or devaluation,

to achieve two targets, internal and external balance, is most unlikely to be successful. To move from point

79

International Finance

B to point A, the authorities need to both deflate the economy and undertake a devaluation by appropriate

amounts. Te deflation combined with a devaluation will control inflation and improve the current account

so that the two objectives can be met. Te idea that a country generally requires as many instruments as it has

targets was elaborated by the Nobel Prize-winning Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen (1952), and is popularly

known as Tinbergen's instruments–targets rule.

While the Swan diagram provides a useful conceptual framework for economic policy discussion, it is

rather simplistic in that the underlying economic relationships are not explicitly de!ned. Furthermore,

there is no role for international capital movements that were an increasingly important feature of the postSecond World War international economy. In addition, there is no distinction made between monetary and

!scal policies as separate means of influencing aggregate demand and output in the economy. Te so-called

Mundell–Fleming model to which we now turn attempts to integrate such features into a formal openeconomy macroeconomic model.

4.3 THE MUNDELL–FLEMING MODEL

Tis model owes its origins to papers published by James Fleming (1962) and Robert Mundell (1962 and 1963).

Teir major contribution was to incorporate international capital movements into formal macroeconomic

models based on the Keynesian IS–LM framework. Teir papers led to some dramatic implications concerning

the e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policy for the attainment of internal and external balance. We shall

now examine the main implications of the Keynesian model and the results of Fleming's and Mundell's papers

by using what is known as IS-LM-BP analysis (investment–savings, liquidity preference–money and balance

- f payments). Firstly, we derive the IS, LM and BP schedules that provide the framework for the analysis.

4.4 DERIVATION OF THE IS SCHEDULE FOR AN OPEN ECONOMY

Te IS curve for an open economy shows various combinations of the level of output ( _Y_ ) and the rate of interest

that make leakages, that is, savings and import expenditure ( _S_ + _M_ ), equal to injections, that is, investment,

government expenditure and exports ( _I_ + _G_ + _X_ ). In an open economy we have the identity:

_Y_ = _C_ + _I_ + _G_ + _X_              - _M_ (4.1)

where _Y_ is the national income, _C_ is domestic consumption, _I_ is domestic investment, _G_ is government

expenditure, _X_ is export expenditure and _M_ is import expenditure.

Tis identity can be restated in terms of equality between leakages and injections. Since _Y_  - _C_ = _S_, where _S_

is savings, we can rewrite equation (4.1) as:

_S_ + _M_ = _I_ + _G_ + _X_ (4.2)

For simplicity the following linear relationships are assumed:

_S_ = _Sa_ + _sY_ (4.3)

80

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

Here, savings _S_ are equal to autonomous savings ( _Sa_ ) plus savings which are a positive function of income,

where _s_ is the marginal propensity to save.

_M_ = _Ma_ + _mY_ (4.4)

Imports _M_ are equal to autonomous imports ( _Ma_ ) plus imports which are a positive function of increases

in income, where _m_ is the marginal propensity to import.

_I_ = _I_ ( _r_ ) d _I_ /d _r_ < 0 (4.5)

Equation (4.5) says that investment is assumed to be an inverse function of the rate of interest. As far as

government expenditure and exports are concerned these are assumed to be autonomous with respect to the

rate of interest and level of national income. Te relationships above are illustrated in Figure 4.2.

Quadrant (1) depicts the relationship between leakages and income; it is an upward-sloping line because

increases in income lead to increased savings and imports, and the slope of the line is given by ( _s_ + _m_ )/1. At income

level _Y_ 1, the corresponding level of leakages is given by _L_ 1, and likewise at income level _Y_ 2 the corresponding level

- f leakages is given by _L_ 2. Te resulting volume of leakages is transferred to quadrant (2), which has a 45-degree
line that converts any distance along the vertical axis to an equivalent distance on the horizontal axis which
measures injections. Hence, the leakages _L_ 1 are converted into an equivalent amount of injection _In_ 1.

Te injections schedule is depicted in quadrant (3) which shows that given the price level and state of

expectations the rate of interest that leads to a level of injections _In_ 1 is given by _r_ 1. Te injections schedule is

downward-sloping from le, to right because investment is inversely related to the rate of interest, while the

level of government expenditure and exports are assumed to be independent of the rate of interest.

We now know that the income level _Y_ 1 generates leakages _L_ 1 which will be equal to injections _In_ 1 if the

interest rate is _r_ 1. Tis means that in quadrant (4) we can depict a point on the IS curve for an open economy

because at interest rate _r_ 1 and income level _Y_ 1 we know that leakages are equal to injections. We can repeat the

same process for the income level _Y_ 2 to obtain the rate of interest _r_ 2 for which leakages are equal to injections.

By repeating the process we can obtain a large number of income and interest rate levels for which leakages

are equal to injections. By joining up these points we obtain the IS curve for an open economy. As can be seen

in quadrant (4), the IS curve is downward-sloping from le, to right in the interest rate/income level space.

Tis is because higher levels of income generate higher levels of leakages requiring a fall in the interest rate to

generate increased investment and maintain equality of injections and leakages.

4.5 DERIVATION OF THE LM SCHEDULE FOR AN OPEN ECONOMY

Te LM schedule shows various combinations of the level of income and rate of interest for which the money

market is in equilibrium; that is, for which money demand equals money supply. In the simpli!ed model, we

assume that money is demanded for only two reasons: transactions purposes and speculative purposes. With

the transactions motive people hold money because there is not normally a synchronization between their

receipt and expenditure of money. In general it is postulated that the higher an individual's income the larger

the amount of money that is held for transactions purposes. Tis is based on the presumption that the higher

- ne's income the greater one's payments and correspondingly the greater the desired holdings of money for
transaction purposes. As such, the transactions demand for money is assumed to be a positive function of
income. Tis is expressed algebraically as:

_Mt_ = _Mt_ ( _Y_ ) (4.6)

where _Mt_ is the transactions demand for money.

Te other reason for holding money is the speculative motive. It is assumed that any money balances

held in excess of those required for transactions purposes are speculative balances. If the rate of interest rises

then so does the opportunity cost of holding money. For instance, if the rate of interest is 5% per annum the

- pportunity cost of £100 is £5 per annum, but if the interest rate is 10% the opportunity cost is £10 per annum
and consequently the demand to hold speculative balances will fall as the rate of interest rises. Tis inverse
relationship between the demand for speculative balances and the rate of interest is expressed algebraically as:

_M_ = _M_ ( _r_ ) (4.7)

_sp_ _sp_

where _Msp_ is the speculative demand for money.

82

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

In equilibrium, the money demand ( _Md_ ) made up of transactions and speculative balances is equal to the

money supply ( _Ms_ ). Tis is expressed algebraically as:

_Md_ = _Msp_ + _Mt_ = _Ms_ (4.8)

Te derivation of the LM curve is illustrated in Figure 4.3. Quadrant (1) depicts the transactions demand

for money as a positive function of income. As income rises from _Y_ 1 to _Y_ 2, the demand for transaction

balances rises from _Mt_ 1 to _Mt_ 2. Te transactions balance !gure is transferred to quadrant (2) which shows

the distribution of the !xed money supply between transaction and speculative balances. Te distance 0a

represents the total money supply, so that if _Mt_ 1 is held for transaction purposes, then 0a minus _Mt_ 1 which is

equal to _Msp_ 1 is held as speculative balances. Quadrant (3) shows the speculative demand for money schedule

which is downward-sloping from le, to right because the demand for speculative balances is inversely related

to the rate of interest. Te schedule reveals that speculative balances _Msp_ 1 are only willingly held at the interest

rate _r_ 1. We now have enough information to plot a point on the LM schedule; this is done in quadrant (4)

which shows that at interest rate _r_ 1 and income level _Y_ 1 the demand for speculative and transaction balances

is equal to the money supply.

By taking another income level _Y_ 2 we can by a similar process !nd a rate of interest _r_ 2 which is compatible

with money-market equilibrium. Other such derivations can be done, and by joining them together we

- btain the LM schedule. Te LM schedule is upward-sloping from le, to right. Tis is because high income
levels require relatively large transaction balances which for a given money supply can only be drawn out of
speculative balances by a relatively high interest rate.

4.6 DERIVATION OF THE BP SCHEDULE FOR AN OPEN ECONOMY

Te balance of payments schedule shows di$erent combinations of rates of interest and income that are

compatible with equilibrium in the balance of payments. When referring to the balance of payments we divide

it up into two sections: the current account and the capital account. Exports are assumed to be independent

- f the level of national income and the rate of interest, but imports are assumed to be positively related to
income, expressed algebraically as:

_M_ = _Ma_ + _mY_ (4.9)

Total imports ( _M_ ) are a function of autonomous imports ( _M_ a) and the level of income, where _m_ is the marginal

propensity to import.

We now need to remind ourselves of the constituent parts of the balance of payments. As we saw in Chapter

2, the overall balance of payments is made up of three major components: the current account ( _CA_ ), the

capital account ( _K_ ) and the change in the authorities reserves (d _R_ ). By maintaining balance in the supply and

demand for the currency – that is, external balance – we mean that there is no need for the authorities to have

to change their holdings of foreign exchange reserves. Tis implies that if there is a current account de!cit

there needs to be an o$setting surplus in the capital account so that the authorities do not have to change their

reserves. Conversely, if there is a current account surplus there needs to be an o$setting de!cit in the capital

account to have equilibrium in the balance of payments.

Since exports are determined exogenously and imports are a positive function of income, the higher the

level of national income the smaller will be any current account surplus or the larger any current account

de!cit. Te net capital flow ( _K_ ) is a positive function of the domestic interest rate. Assuming that the rate of

### ®

interest in the rest of the world ( _r_ *) is !xed, the higher the domestic interest rate the greater the capital inflow

into the country, or the smaller any capital outflow. Tis relationship is expressed algebraically as:

_K_ = _K_ ( _r_                     - _r_ *) (4.10)

Since the balance of payments schedule shows various combinations of levels of income, and the rate of

interest for which the balance of payments is in equilibrium, then:

_X_                    - _M_ + _K_ = 0 (4.11)

A positive _K_ indicates a net inflow of funds, whereas a negative _K_ indicates a net outflow of funds.

Te derivation of the BP schedule is illustrated in Figure 4.4. Quadrant (1) shows the relationship between

the current account and level of national income. Te current balance schedule slopes downwards from le,

to right because increases in income lead to a deterioration of the current account. At income level _Y_ 1 there

is a current account surplus of _CA_ 1, whereas at income level _Y_ 2 there is a current account de!cit of _CA_ 2. Te

**Figure 4.4** Derivation of the BP schedule

current account surplus or de!cit is transferred to quadrant (2) where the 45-degree line converts the current

_CA_ there is a

account position to an equal capital flow of the opposite sign. With a current account surplus 1

required capital outflow _K_ 1 to ensure balance of payments equilibrium, while a current account de!cit _CA_ 2

_K_

requires a capital inflow 2. Quadrant (3) shows the rate of interest that is required for a given capital flow. Te

capital flow schedule is downward-sloping from le, to right because high interest rates encourage a net capital

inflow, whereas low interest rates encourage a net capital outflow. To get a capital outflow of _K_ 1 requires the

interest rate to be _r_ 1, while a capital inflow of _K_ 2 requires a higher interest rate _r_ 2.

Since income level _Y_ 1 is associated with a balance of payments surplus, there has to be an o$setting capital

- utflow _K_ 1 which requires an interest rate _r_ 1; these coordinates give a point on the BP schedule that is depicted
in quadrant (4). Te BP schedule is upward-sloping because higher levels of income cause a deterioration in
the current account, which necessitates a reduced capital outflow/higher capital inflow requiring a higher

85

International Finance

interest rate. Every point on the BP schedule shows a combination of domestic income and rate of interest for

which the overall balance of payments is in equilibrium. At points to the le, of the BP schedule the overall

balance of payments is in surplus because for a given amount of capital flows the current account is better

than that required for equilibrium as the level of income is lower. Conversely, to the right of the BP schedule

the overall balance of payments is in de!cit as the income level is higher than that compatible with overall

equilibrium.

At this point it is worth noting that the slope of the BP schedule is determined by the degree of capital

mobility internationally: the higher the degree of capital mobility then the flatter the BP schedule. Tis is

because for a given increase in income which leads to a deterioration of the current account, the higher the

degree of capital mobility the smaller the required rise in the domestic interest rate to attract sufficient capital

inflows to ensure overall equilibrium. When capital is perfectly mobile, the slightest rise in the domestic

interest rate above the world interest rate leads to a massive capital inflow making the BP schedule horizontal

at the world interest rate. At the other extreme, if capital is perfectly immobile internationally then a rise in

the domestic interest will fail to attract capital inflows, making the BP schedule vertical at the income level

that ensures current account balance. Between these two extremes, that is, when we have an upward-sloping

BP schedule, we say that capital is imperfectly mobile.

4.7 EQUILIBRIUM OF THE MODEL

Figure 4.5 depicts all three schedules intersecting through a common point. Te BP schedule is steeper than

the LM schedule, but this need not always be the case. As we shall see later, changing the relative slope of the

two schedules can lead to somewhat di$erent policy prescriptions. All three schedules pass through a common

point A which corresponds to the domestic interest rate _r_ 1 and income level _Y_ 1. Te income level _Y_ 1 is seen

to be less than that of the full employment level of income _Y_ F, implying that there is some unemployment in

the economy. Although the economy is not in internal equilibrium, the balance of payments is in equilibrium

because the IS and LM schedules intersect at a point on the BP schedule.

Te explanation as to why the IS–LM schedules do not intersect at the full employment level of income _Y_ F

is that at _Y_ F planned leakages (savings and import expenditure) would exceed planned injections (government

expenditure, exports and investment). Tis would imply a build-up of stocks of unsold goods leading

producers to reduce output. Only at output level _Y_ 1 do planned leakages equal planned injections so that

changes in stocks are avoided.

Figure 4.6 illustrates scenarios where there is a surplus or de!cit in the balance of payments. In Figure%4.6(a),

because the IS and LM schedules intersect to the le, of the BP schedule, there is a balance of payments

surplus. Tis surplus comes about because the level of income is too low and/or the rate of interest is too high

to be compatible with overall equilibrium. In Figure 4.6(b) there is a balance of payments de!cit because the

IS and LM schedules intersect to the right of the BP schedule, which means that the income level _Y_ 2 is too high

and/or the interest rate _r_ 2 is too low, inducing an overall balance of payments de!cit.

4.8 FACTORS SHIFTING THE IS–LM–BP SCHEDULES

In the analysis of the rest of this chapter we need to consider how changes in the exchange rate and monetary

and !scal policies a$etc the position of the various schedules.

_Factors shifting the IS schedule_

Te IS schedule will shi, to the right if there is an increase in either investment, government expenditure or

exports. Tis is because an increase in these injections requires a higher level of national income to induce a

matching increase in leakages in the form of increased savings and imports. An autonomous fall in savings or

imports will also require a rightward shi, of the IS schedule because a higher level of income is required to

induce more savings and import expenditure so as to maintain equality of leakages and injections. Another

87

International Finance

important factor that causes a rightward shi, of the IS schedule is a depreciation or devaluation of the

exchange rate, providing that the Marshall–Lerner condition holds; this is because a depreciation (rise) in the

exchange rate leads to a reduction of import expenditure and an increase in export sales so that injections then

exceed leakages, requiring an increased level of income to bring them back into equality.

_Factors shifting the LM schedule_

Te LM schedule will shi, to the right if there is an increase in the domestic money supply because, for a given

rate of interest, the increased supply will only be willingly held if there is an increase in income which leads

to a rise in the transactions demand for money. A depreciation of the exchange rate will lead to a rise in the

aggregate price index, that is, an index made up of a weighted basket of domestic and foreign imported goods

(see equation 3.16), because it implies a rise in the price of imports. Tis means that real money balances will

be reduced and there will be a resulting increase in the demand for money that can only be eliminated by

reducing the transactions demand for money, implying a lower level of income and a le,ward shi, of the LM

schedule.

_Factors shifting the BP schedule_

An autonomous increase in exports or an autonomous decrease in imports will lead to an improvement in

the current account requiring a rightward shi, of the BP schedule to induce a sufficient increase in imports to

maintain balance of payments equilibrium. Another factor that can cause a rightward shi, of the BP schedule

is a depreciation/devaluation of the exchange rate, providing the Marshall–Lerner condition holds; this leads

to the value of export sales rising and the value of import expenditure declining. Hence, the only way to ensure

- verall balance of payments equilibrium is a rise in the level of domestic income.

Bearing in mind these shi, factors we will proceed to look at how this toolkit can be usefully applied to

some key issues in the realm of open-economy macroeconomic policy.

4.9 INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL BALANCE

Te Swan diagram shows that authorities generally need as many instruments as they have targets and reveals

that the use of both expenditure-switching and expenditure-changing policies can lead to the attainment of

internal and external balance. However, it was not possible to distinguish between the fact that !scal and

monetary policies are quite di$erent and independent types of expenditure-changing policies. Tis begs

the question as to whether it is feasible to achieve the twin objectives of internal and external balance by

combining !scal and monetary policies without the need to adjust the exchange rate?

Before attempting to answer this question we need to consider how monetary and !scal policy may be

used as policy instruments for achieving internal and external balance, and to consider how the two policies

influence economic activity.

_Monetary policy_

When the authorities conduct an expansionary monetary policy they purchase bonds from the public, which

pushes up the price of bonds, expands the money supply and leads to a fall in the domestic interest rate.

Te fall in the domestic interest rate will stimulate investment and so lead to a rise in output. As far as the

88

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

balance of payments is concerned, the increased income leads to a deterioration of the current account and

the lower interest rate will lead to increased capital outflows so that the balance of payments moves into

de!cit. Conversely, a contractionary monetary policy involves the authorities selling bonds, which pushes

down the price of bonds, reduces the money supply and leads to a rise in the domestic interest rate. Te rise

in the interest rate leads to less investment and a fall in output. Te balance of payments position will improve

as imports fall and the higher interest rate attracts capital inflows.

_Fiscal policy_

With an expansionary !scal policy, the government increases its expenditure; with pure !scal policy it

!nances this increased expenditure by selling bonds. Te increased expenditure shi,s the IS schedule to the

right through the government expenditure multiplier e$ect examined in Chapter 3. However, the bond sales

will depress the price of bonds thereby raising the domestic interest rate which will partially o$set expansion

in output. Te precise e$ect of the !scal expansion on the balance of payments is indeterminate because,

while the expansion of output will worsen the current account, the rise in interest rates will improve the

capital account. Te converse reasoning holds for a contractionary !scal policy. Te money supply is not

a$ected by the expansionary !scal policy since the money raised by bond sales is used to !nance the increased

government expenditure.

_Sterilized and non-sterilized intervention_

One other policy which we need to clarify is the distinction between sterilized and non-sterilized intervention

in the foreign exchange market. With sterilized intervention the authorities o$set the money-base implications

- f their exchange market interventions to ensure that the changes in reserves due to intervention do not
a$ect the domestic money base, whereas with a policy of non-sterilized intervention the authorities allow the
reserve changes resulting from their interventions to a$etc the monetary base.

Te distinction between sterilized and non-sterilized intervention by an example of what happens if

there is a monetary expansion under !xed exchange rates is depicted in Figure 4.7. A monetary expansion

shi,s the LM schedule to the right from LM1 to LM2. Tis causes a fall in the interest rate to _r_ 2 and a rise in

domestic income to _Y_ 2; the result is a balance of payments de!cit as both the current and capital accounts

deteriorate. Te de!cit means that there is an excess supply of the currency on the foreign exchange

market and to maintain a !xed exchange rate the authorities have to purchase the home currency with

reserves.

Ordinarily, the purchases of the home currency by the authorities would start to shi, the LM schedule back

to the le, from LM2 towards LM1. Tis is an example of non-sterilized intervention, that is, the authorities

allow their interventions in the foreign exchange market to influence the money supply. However, if the

authorities pursue a policy of sterilization of reserve changes, the reserve falls which reduce the money supply

are exactly o$set by a further expansion of the money supply so that the LM schedule remains at point LM2. A

clear problem with a sterilization policy is that, by remaining at LM2 with interest rate _r_ 2 and income level _Y_ 2,

the authorities will su$er a continuous balance of payments de!cit and a continuous fall in reserves. Such a

sterilization policy is only feasible in the short run because over the longer run reserves would eventually run

- ut, making a devaluation inevitable.

We are now in a position to examine how !scal and monetary policy and exchange rate policy can be

variously combined to simultaneously achieve both internal and external balance.

4.10 INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL BALANCE UNDER FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

A situation of !xed exchange rates and unemployment is depicted in Figure 4.8. Te economy is assumed

to be at point A with interest rate _r_ 1 and income level _Y_ 1, which means that while the economy is in external

balance the income level is below the full employment level of income _Y_ F.

Te government attempts to eradicate the unemployment via a bond-!nanced !scal expansion, which

shi,s the IS schedule to the right from IS1 to IS2. Domestic output expands from _Y_ 1 to _Y_ 2 and the economy

would be at point B with interest rate _r_ 2. In raising the level of output beyond the full employment level we

!nd that the induced increase in imports moves the current account into de!cit, and although the rise in

the interest rate attracts some capital inflow the balance of payments is in overall de!cit since the economy

is to the right of the BP schedule. Te authorities are forced to purchase the home currency in the foreign

exchange market, but because they pursue a sterilization policy the LM schedule remains at LM1. Hence, using

- nly a single policy instrument, in this case !scal policy, the government can temporarily achieve its internal
- bjective at the expense of a sacri!ce in the objective of external balance.

Ideally, however, the authorities would like to achieve both internal and external balance. Tis is possible

if they combine the expansionary !scal policy – IS1 to IS2 – with a contractionary monetary policy which

shi,s the LM schedule from LM1 to LM2 where it passes through point C on the BP schedule. Te restrictive

monetary policy raises interest rates further than in the case of a solely !scal expansion to _r_ 3, and in so doing

**Figure 4.8** Internal and external balance under a !xed exchange rate

attracts additional capital inflows so as to restore the balance of payments back to equilibrium. Hence, by

combining an expansionary !scal policy with a contractionary monetary policy the authorities can achieve

both internal and external balance. An important lesson from this example is that the authorities can achieve

both internal and external balance without the need to change the exchange rate; this is because they have two

independent instruments, monetary and !scal policy, and two targets.

4.11 INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL BALANCE UNDER FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES

According to our analysis of the Swan diagram, by combining an exchange rate change with an expenditurechanging policy it is possible to achieve both internal and external balance. An interesting issue that we can

explore within the framework of our model is what are the likely di$erences of achieving internal and external

balance by combining exchange rate changes with monetary policy as opposed to doing so by combining

exchange rate changes with !scal policy. To examine this issue we !rst consider the case of combining

exchange rate adjustments with monetary policy, and then examine the implications of combining exchange

rate adjustment with !scal policy.

Figure 4.9 considers the case of monetary expansion under floating exchange rates. Initial equilibrium is

at point A with interest rate _r_ 1 and output level _Y_ 1. Te authorities adopt an expansionary monetary policy

and this shi,s the LM schedule from LM to LM . Te combination of a fall in the interest rate and increase in

income leads to a balance of payments de!cit at point B. However, the exchange rate is allowed to depreciate

and this leads to a rightward shi, of the IS schedule from IS1 to IS2, and a rightward shi, of the BP schedule

from BP1 to BP2. However, it also leads to a le,ward shi, of the LM schedule until all three schedules intersect

at a common point such as C, with new income level _Y_ 2 and interest rate _r_ 2. Hence, by using monetary policy

in conjunction with exchange rate changes, it is possible to raise real output to the full employment level and

achieve external balance simultaneously.

Overall, the money-supply expansion results in an exchange rate depreciation, a fall in the domestic

interest rate and an increase in income. Te lower interest rate implies a lower capital inflow/higher capital

- utflow than before the money supply expansion, while the increase in income worsens the current account.
Tis implies that the depreciation improves the current account to exactly o$set the preceding e$ects.

_Fiscal expansion under floating exchange rates_

Te e$ects of a !scal expansion on the exchange rate under floating rates depend crucially upon the slope of

the BP schedule relative to the LM schedule. We shall consider two cases: in case 1 the BP schedule is steeper

than the LM schedule, while in case 2 the reverse is true.

In Figure 4.10 the BP schedule is steeper than the LM schedule, which means that capital flows are relatively

insensitive to interest rate changes, while money demand is fairly elastic with respect to the interest rate. An

expansionary !scal policy shi,s the IS schedule from IS1 to IS2. Te induced rise of the domestic interest rate

and domestic income has opposing e$ects on the balance of payments: the expansion in real output leads to

a deterioration of the current account, but the rise in the interest rate improves the capital account. However,

because capital flows are relatively immobile the former e$ect outweighs the latter, so the balance of payments

moves into de!cit. In turn, the de!cit leads to a depreciation of the exchange rate, which has the e$etc of

shi,ing the BP schedule to the right from BP1 to BP2, the LM schedule to the le, from LM1 to LM2, and the IS

schedule even further to the right from IS2 to IS3. Final equilibrium is obtained at point C, with interest rate _r_ 2

and income level _Y_ 2. Hence, the deterioration in the balance of payments resulting from the rise in real income

is o$set by a combination of a higher interest rate and an exchange rate depreciation.

In Figure 4.11 an expansionary !scal policy shi,s the IS schedule from IS1 to IS2. In this case, because

capital flows are much more responsive to changes in interest rates, the BP schedule is less steep than the LM

schedule. Te increased capital inflow more than o$sets the deterioration in the current account due to the

increase in income, and the balance of payments moves into surplus. Te surplus induces an appreciation of

the exchange rate, which moves the LM schedule to the right from LM1 to LM2, the BP schedule to the le,

from BP1 to BP2, and the IS schedule to the le, from IS2 to IS3. Equilibrium is obtained at a higher level of

- output, higher interest rate and an exchange rate appreciation.

Hence a !scal expansion can, according to the degree of international capital mobility, lead to either an

exchange rate depreciation or an exchange rate appreciation.

4.12 A SMALL OPEN ECONOMY WITH PERFECT CAPITAL MOBILITY

One prominent feature of the post-Second World War international monetary system has been the increasing

integration of international capital markets. Tere has been a great deal of discussion about the desirability

- f these capital flows and how they might threaten the ability of authorities to conduct e$ective economic

**Figure 4.11** Case 2: A !scal expansion under floating exchange rates

policies. In classic papers, Mundell (1962) and Fleming (1962) sought to examine the implications of high

capital mobility for a small country that had no ability to influence world interest rates. Teir papers showed

that for such a country, the choice of exchange rate regime would have radical implications concerning the

e$ectiveness of monetary and !scal policy in influencing the level of economic activity.

Te model assumes a small country facing perfect capital mobility. Any attempt to raise the domestic

interest rate leads to a massive capital inflow to purchase domestic bonds, pushing up the price of bonds until

the interest rate returns to the world interest rate. Conversely, any attempt to lower the domestic interest rate

leads to a massive capital outflow as international investors seek higher world interest rates. Such massive

bond sales mean that the domestic interest rate immediately returns to the world interest rate so as to stop the

capital outflow. Te implication of perfect capital mobility is that the BP schedule for a small open economy

becomes a horizontal straight line at a domestic interest rate that is the same as the world interest rate.

Figure 4.12 depicts a small open economy with a !xed exchange rate. Te initial level of income is where

the IS–LM curves intersect at the income level _Y_ 1, which is below the full employment level of income _Y_ F. If

the authorities attempt to raise output by a monetary expansion the LM schedule shi,s to the right from LM1

to LM

2. Tere is downward pressure on the domestic interest rate and this results in a massive capital outflow.

Tis capital outflow means that there is pressure for a devaluation of the currency: the authorities have to

intervene in the foreign exchange market to purchase the home currency with reserves. Such purchases result

in a reduction of the money supply in the hands of private agents. Te purchases have to continue until

the LM curve shi,s back to its original position at LM1 where the domestic interest rate is restored to the

world interest rate. With perfect capital mobility, any attempt to pursue a sterilization policy leads to such

large reserve losses that it cannot be pursued. Hence, with perfect capital mobility and !xed exchange rates,

monetary policy is ine$ective at influencing output.

**Figure 4.12** Fixed exchange rates and perfect capital mobility

By contrast, if there is a !scal expansion this shi,s the IS schedule to the right from IS1 to IS2, which puts

upward pressure on the domestic interest rate and leads to a massive capital inflow. To prevent an appreciation

the authorities have to purchase the foreign currency with the domestic currency. Tis means that the amount

- f domestic currency held by private agents increases and the LM1 schedule shi,s to the right from LM1 to LM2.
Te increase in the money stock continues until the LM schedule passes through the IS2 schedule at the initial
interest rate and output level YF. Hence, under !xed exchange rates and perfect capital mobility, an active !scal
policy alone has the ability to achieve both internal and external balance. Tis is an exception to the instruments–
targets rule, although monetary policy does have to adjust passively to maintain the !xed exchange rate.

to LM

In this case, we have a floating exchange rate. A monetary expansion shi,s the LM schedule from LM1 2

leading to downward pressure on the interest rate, a capital outflow and a depreciation of the exchange rate.

Te depreciation leads to an increase in exports and reduction in imports, thus shi,ing the IS curve to the

right and the LM schedule to the le,, so that !nal equilibrium is obtained at a higher level of income, say _Y_ 2.

Clearly with an appropriate initial monetary expansion the authorities could obtain both internal and external

balance by monetary policy alone.

Suppose, instead, the authorities attempt to expand output by an expansionary !scal policy. Te increased

government expenditure shi,s the IS schedule to the right from IS1 to IS2, but the bond sales that !nance the

_r_ 1

**Figure 4.13** Floating exchange rates and perfect capital mobility

expansion lead to upward pressure on the domestic interest rate, resulting in a massive capital inflow and

an appreciation of the exchange rate. Te appreciation of the exchange rate results in a reduction of exports

and an increase in imports, which forces the IS schedule back to its original position. Hence, with floating

exchange rates and perfect capital mobility !scal policy is ine$ective at influencing real output.

By contrast, a monetary expansion that shi,s the LM schedule from LM1 to LM2 leads to a fall in the

domestic interest rate and a depreciation of the exchange rate. Tis depreciation then leads to an increase in

exports and a reduction in imports that shi,s the IS schedule to the right from IS1 to IS2 and some reduction

- f the real money stock, shi,ing LM2 to the le, to, say, LM3, so that overall income rises to _Y_ 2. In this instance,
it is monetary policy alone which can achieve both internal and external balance, although the exchange rate
adjusts passively to the change in the money stock.

Te contrast between the e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policy with perfect capital mobility under

di$erent exchange rate regimes is one of the most famous results in international economics. Monetary policy

is ine$ective at influencing output under !xed exchange rates, while it alone can influence output under

floating exchange rates. By contrast, !scal policy alone is e$ective at influencing output under a !xed exchange

rate, while it is ine$ective under floating exchange rates.

  - ther possible combination is goals 2 and 3, which is the case when a country permits free movement
  - f capital whilst maintaining a !xed exchange rate. A good example of this is Hong Kong which pegs
the Hong Kong dollar rigidly to the US dollar and allows free movement of capital into and out of the
country. Te price, however, is that it gives up its monetary independence; if the Federal Reserve of the
United States raises dollar interest rates then the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has to raise
its rates or the Hong Kong dollar would come under speculative attack. Conversely, if the US lowers its
interest rates the HKMA more or less automatically lowers its interest rates.

Te trilemma is particularly important for developing countries, many of which choose to !x their

exchange rates, for example to the US dollar; but if they choose to do this then they must either give up

control of their monetary policy or impose capital controls if they wish to have some degree of monetary

autonomy. Imposing capital controls may give them some degree of monetary autonomy, though access

to international capital markets is essential to the longer-term process of economic development. On the

  - ther hand, liberalization of capital flows will mean that they have to sacri!ce their monetary autonomy
and will have to raise or lower their interest rates if the Federal Reserve changes US short-term interest
rates, regardless of the state of their economies, should they wish to maintain their !xed exchange rate.

4.13 THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE MARKET CLASSIFICATION

While Tinbergen's instruments–targets rule shows us that we generally need two instruments to achieve

both internal and external balance, it does not tell us which instrument should be assigned to which target.

We have seen that we can use combinations of !scal and monetary policy to achieve internal and external

balance under !xed exchange rates or combinations of monetary or !scal policy under floating exchange

rates.

Mundell (1968) suggested that what he called the principle of e$ective market classi!cation should be

used by economic policy-makers in conjunction with Tinbergen's instruments–targets rule. By the principle

- f e$ective market classi!cation, Mundell stated that ‘policies should be paired with the objectives on which
they have the most influence’ (1962, p. 79). For instance, if monetary policy is the most e$ective instrument
at controlling external balance, and !scal policy best at influencing output, then this is also the appropriate
pairing of instruments to targets. Te principle of e$ective market classi!cation seems eminently sensible –
by analogy a conductor should be assigned to conducting an orchestra and a doctor assigned to a hospital
and not vice versa! What makes the Mundell principle of e$ective market classi!cation interesting is the
suggestion that if this principle is not adopted economies may su$er from cyclical instability.

Te problem for economic policy-makers, in determining which instruments to assign to which targets, is

termed the 'assignment problem'. Mundell suggested that under !xed exchange rates monetary policy should

be assigned to external balance and !scal policy to internal balance.

An illustration of the assignment problem is shown in Figure 4.15, which illustrates internal and external

balance schedules for various !scal and monetary policy stances under a !xed exchange rate regime. On

the vertical axis we have monetary policy which is neutral at point _N_ M, but expansionary above this, while

it is contractionary below. Similarly, the !scal policy stance is neutral at point _N_ F, expansionary to the right

and contractionary to the le,. Te internal balance schedule has a negative slope, because if we start at full

employment a contractionary monetary policy has to be accompanied by an expansionary !scal policy to

maintain full employment. To the right of the IB schedule the !scal/monetary policy mix is so expansionary

as to cause inflation, whereas to the le, the !scal/monetary policy mix is deflationary.

98

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

Te external balance schedule may have a positive or negative slope, because an expansionary !scal policy

has two conflicting e$ects on the balance of payments, as we saw in Figures 4.10 and 4.11. On the one hand,

the increase in income leads to a deterioration in the current account which worsens the balance of payments;

- n the other hand the rise in interest rates leads to an inflow of capital which improves the balance of
payments. In Figure 4.15 we have drawn the EB schedule with a negative slope, meaning that an expansionary
!scal policy causes a net deterioration in the balance of payments (the current account e$ect dominates the
capital account e$etc). Tis being the case, when !scal policy is expansionary monetary policy has to be
contractionary, which by raising the domestic interest rate increases capital inflows to ensure equilibrium in
the balance of payments.

In Figure 4.15 the IB schedule is drawn steeper than the EB schedule, which must be the case because a !scal

expansion which causes a rise in income of _x_ % will cause less of a deterioration in the balance of payments than

a monetary policy that increases income by _x_ %. Tis is because a !scal expansion will lead to a rise in interest

rates, leading to a partial o$setting of capital inflows, while a money expansion leads to a fall in interest rates,

leading to an additional deterioration in the balance of payments above the income e$etc. Hence, monetary

policy has more e$ect on external balance than !scal policy. As monetary policy is relatively more e$ective

at influencing external balance, then !scal policy is relatively more e$ective with respect to internal balance.

According to Mundell's classi!cation, if we are at point A with internal balance but a balance of payments

de!cit, a contractionary monetary policy moves the economy to, say, point B on the external balance curve,

Monetary policy

International Finance

though this leads to unemployment which is then tackled by an expansionary !scal policy moving to point

C on the internal balance curve. Tis pushes the economy back into de!cit, which is then accompanied by a

monetary contraction to achieve external balance. Each time we need less and less adjustment of monetary

and !scal policy; we also have a stable assignment as we are clearly converging to the intersection of the

internal and external balance schedules.

Suppose policy-makers get the assignment wrong and use !scal policy to eradicate the balance of payments

de!cit and monetary policy for internal balance. In such circumstances, the !scal contraction moves the

economy from point A to point D; external balance is achieved but at the cost of high unemployment. If the

authorities then use an expansionary monetary policy to achieve internal balance, the economy moves from

point D to point E. Clearly, such a policy assignment proves to be unstable, moving the economy away from

the simultaneous achievement of internal and external balance. Te danger exists that the authorities could

get the assignment wrong and cause considerable damage to the economy before they eventually reverse their

assignment to the correct one. Given this, it may be wise to try to achieve targets gradually by adjusting policy

instruments slowly to make sure they are having the intended e$etc.

Unfortunately, there is no unambiguous answer to the assignment problem. Consider, for example,

- ur analysis of a small open economy under conditions of perfect capital mobility. We have seen that the
e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policy at influencing output depends upon whether or not there is a !xed or
floating exchange rate. If the exchange rate is !xed then !scal policy should be paired with the objective of full
employment, whereas if the exchange rate is floating then one should assign monetary policy. Te assignment
problem has no simple solution and is considerably more complicated once we have three targets and three
instruments. Te appropriate pairing of instruments and targets depends upon the structural parameters
governing the behaviour of an economy. Tis includes, amongst others, the degree of capital mobility, the
marginal propensities to save and import, the income and interest elasticity of demand for money, the price
elasticity of demand for imports and exports, and the responsiveness of investment to interest rate variations.

4.14 LIMITATIONS OF THE MUNDELL–FLEMING MODEL

Te IS–LM–BP model has been one of the major policy models underlying economic policy formulation

for open economies over the last !ve decades. Given this, we need to look at some of the limitations of the

model, not least because these criticisms were one of the reasons motivating the formulation of the monetary

approach to the balance of payments and economic policy that is the subject matter of Chapter 5. A number

- f the criticisms relate to the short-run nature of the model:
 - **Te Marshall–Lerner condition.** Te model assumes that the Marshall–Lerner condition holds, even
though the model is essentially of a short-term nature, which is the time scale when the Marshall–
Lerner conditions are least likely to be met.

 - **Interaction of stocks and flows.** Te model ignores the problem of the interaction of stocks and
flows. According to the model a current account de!cit can be !nanced by a capital inflow. While
such a policy is feasible in the short run, a capital inflow over time increases the stock of foreign
liabilities owed by the country to the rest of the world, and this factor means a worsening of the
future current account as interest is paid abroad. Clearly, a country cannot go on !nancing a current
account de!cit inde!nitely as the country becomes an ever-increasing debtor to the rest of the world.

 - **Neglect of long-run budget constraints.** In an excellent review of the Mundell–Fleming model,
Frenkel and Razin (1987) highlight the fact that one of the major de!ciencies of the model is that

100

Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy

it fails to take account of long-run constraints that govern both the private and public sector. In

the long run, private-sector spending has to equal its disposable income, while, in the absence of

money creation, government expenditure (inclusive of its debt-service repayments) has to equal its

revenue from taxation. Tis means that in the long run the current account has to be in balance. One

implication of these budget constraints is that a forward-looking private sector would realize that

increased government expenditure will imply higher taxation for them in the future, and this will

induce increased private-sector savings today that will undermine the e$ectiveness of !scal policy.

- **Wealth effects.** Te model does not allow for wealth e$ects that may help in the process of restoring
long-run equilibrium. A decrease in wealth resulting from a fall in foreign assets will ordinarily lead
to a reduction in import expenditure which should help to reduce the current account de!cit. While
such an omission of wealth e$ects on the import expenditure function may be justi!ed as being of
small signi!cance in the short run, the omission nevertheless again emphasizes the essentially shortterm nature of the model.

- **Neglect of supply-side factors.** One of the obvious limitations of the model is that it concentrates
  - n the demand side of the economy and neglects the supply side. Tere is an implicit assumption
that supply adjusts in accordance with changes in demand. In addition, because the aggregate supply
curve is horizontal up to full employment, increases in aggregate demand do not lead to changes in
the domestic price level; rather they are reflected solely by increases in real output.

- **Treatment of capital flows.** One of the biggest problems of the model concerns the modelling of
capital flows. It is assumed that a rise in the domestic interest rate leads to a continuous capital
inflow from abroad. However, to expect such flows to continue inde!nitely is unrealistic because,
a,er a point, international investors will have rearranged the stocks of their international portfolios
to their desired portfolios, and once this happens the net capital inflows into the country will cease.
Te only way that the country could then continue to attract capital inflows would be a further rise
in its interest rate until once again international portfolios are restored to desired portfolios. Hence,
a country that needs a continuous capital inflow to !nance its current account de!cit has to raise
continuously its interest rate. In other words, capital inflows are a function of the change in the
interest di$erential rather than the di$erential itself.

- **Exchange rate expectations.** A major problem with the model is the treatment of exchange rate
expectations. Te model does not explicitly model exchange rate expectations but rather implicitly
presumes that the expected change of the exchange rate is zero, which is known as a 'static
exchange rate expectation'. While this might not seem to be an unreasonable assumption under
!xed exchange rates, it is less tenable under floating exchange rates. According to the model a
monetary expansion leads to a depreciation of the currency under floating exchange rates – in such
circumstances it seems unreasonable to assume that economic agents do not expect a depreciation
as well. If agents expect a depreciation this may require a rise in the domestic interest rate to
encourage them to continue to hold the currency which will have an adverse e$ect on domestic
investment – implying a weaker expansionary e$etc of monetary policy than is suggested by the
model.

- **Flexibility of policy instruments.** Another criticism is that the analysis is of a comparative static
nature and assumes that adjusting monetary and !scal policy is a fairly simple matter. In the real
world, the political process means that the degree of flexibility to adjust economic policy, especially
!scal policy, is hard to achieve.

4.15 CONCLUSIONS

In this chapter we have illustrated some important aspects concerning the conduct of economic policy in

an open economy. While !scal and/or monetary policy may be useful in achieving full employment, they

will also have important implications for the balance of payments and exchange rate which will in turn have

feedback e$ects on the domestic economy. Economic policy formulation in an open economy has to take into

account many important additional considerations compared to a simple closed economy.

Among the most important lessons for economic policy-makers is that they generally need as many

independent policy instruments as they have targets. Tis result is important because the idea that the

authorities can use a single policy instrument such as monetary policy alone to achieve all the targets of

economic policy is highly questionable. Nevertheless, policy-makers still have a major policy problem in

deciding which instrument to assign to which target. Since the structures of economies di$er, no general

rules exist to solve this problem. Teory warns that an incorrect assignment may provoke rather than limit

instability in the economy.

In the real world the achievement of internal and external balance will be far more difficult than our

theoretical analysis has suggested. Policy-makers face uncertainty over means–end relationships, there are

time-lag problems, the authorities are in possession of only limited information about the position of an

economy, and economies are continually being subjected to new shocks as well as adjusting to previous shocks.

In practice, getting close to targets is likely to be the name of the game rather than actually achieving them.

We have seen that the relative e$ectiveness of !scal and monetary policy is very much dependent upon the

choice of exchange rate regime. In particular, with perfect capital mobility, monetary policy is more e$ective

under a floating exchange rate regime, while !scal policy is more e$ective under a !xed exchange rate. One of

the crucial parameters determining the e$ectiveness of both !scal and monetary policy in an open economy

is the degree of !nancial integration of an economy with the rest of the world as reflected by the mobility of

capital internationally.

Although the Mundell–Fleming model has many limitations, it nonetheless focuses attention on the

difficulties and dilemmas facing policy-makers in an open economy. Perhaps its most signi!cant contribution

to international economics is that it focuses on the important role that international capital flows can play in

determining the e$ectiveness of macroeconomic policies under alternative exchange rate regimes.

5.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we shall look at one of the most influential policy analyses of the balance of payments known

as the monetary approach. Tis approach to balance of payments analysis was pioneered by Marina Whitman

(1975) and Jacob Frenkel and Harry Johnson (1976). Te fundamental basis of the monetary approach is

that the balance of payments is essentially a monetary phenomenon. Not only is the balance of payments

a measurement of monetary flows, but such flows can only be explained by a disequilibrium in the stock

demand for and supply of money.

Tere are several variants of the monetary approach to the balance of payments, and not all advocates

- f it necessarily accept all the assumptions used. We shall outline a simple model that captures the essential
message of the monetary approach – that disequilibrium in the balance of payments reflects disequilibrium
in the money market. Consequently, balance of payments analysis needs to focus on both the supply of and
demand for money.

Within the context of the monetary model, we shall examine how a devaluation will impinge upon the

balance of payments. We then proceed to examine how the model can be used to highlight some fundamentally

di$erent implications of !xed and floating exchange rates. We will compare and contrast the e$ects of a

money supply shock, a rise in domestic income and a foreign price shock under !xed and floating rates. We

International Finance

will then summarize the policy implications of the monetary approach and consider how the model di$ers

from the Keynesian model examined in Chapter 4.

5.2 A SIMPLE MONETARY MODEL

Tere are three key assumptions that underlie the monetary model; these are a stable money demand function,

a vertical aggregate supply schedule and purchasing power parity (PPP).

_Stable money demand function_

Te most basic postulate of the monetary approach to the balance of payments is that there is a stable demand

for money function that is made up of only a few variables. Te monetarists use the quantity theory of money

as the basis of the money demand function, which is written as:

_M_ d [�] _kPy where k_          - 0 (5.1)

where _M_ d is the demand for nominal money balances, _P_ is the domestic price level, _y_ is real domestic%income

and _k_ is a parameter that measures the sensitivity of money demand to changes in nominal income.

Te demand for money is a positive function of the domestic price level, because the demand for money is

a demand for real money balances. A rise in the domestic price level will reduce real money balances ( _M_ / _P_ )

and accordingly lead to an equiproportionate increase in the demand for money. Te demand for money is

positively related to real domestic income: a rise in real income will, _ceteris paribus_, lead to an increase in

the transactions demand for money. Te money demand function forms the basis of the aggregate demand

schedule, which is illustrated in Figure 5.1 for a simple monetary model.

From equation (5.1), if we hold the money supply/money demand !xed and assume that _k_ is a !xed

parameter, then an increase in _y_ from _y_ 1 to _y_ 2 requires an equiproportionate fall in the price level from _P_ 1 to

_P_ 2. Since _P_ 1 _y_ 1 = _P_ 2 _y_ 2 the aggregate demand schedule is a rectangular hyperbola given by AD1. A fall in the

price level from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2, given a !xed money supply, will create excess real money balances ( _M_ / _P_ ) and this

leads to increased aggregate demand from _y_ 1 to _y_ 2. An increase in the money supply has the e$etc of shi,ing

the aggregate demand schedule to the right from AD1 to AD2, because at any given price level there is a rise in

real money balances which leads to increased aggregate demand.

_Vertical aggregate supply schedule_

Te simple monetary model assumes that the labour market is sufficiently flexible that the economy is

continuously at a full employment level of output. In other words, wages are sufficiently flexible that they are

constantly at the level that equates the supply and demand for labour. Furthermore, a rise in the domestic

price level does not lead to an increase in domestic output because wages adjust immediately to the higher

price level so that there is no advantage for domestic producers to take on more labour. Tis means that the

aggregate supply schedule is vertical at the full employment level of output, as shown in Figure 5.2.

Although the aggregate supply schedule AS1 is vertical at the full employment level of output _y_ 1, this does

not mean that output is always constrained to be !xed at _y_ 1; the aggregate supply schedule may shi, to the

right to, say, AS2 if there is an improvement in productivity due to technological progress, which means that

full employment is associated with a higher level of real output.

_Purchasing power parity (PPP)_

Te !nal assumption that underpins the monetary model is the assumption of purchasing power parity (PPP).

PPP theory is examined in much more detail in Chapter 6, but for the time being we can state that in its simpli!ed

version the theory says that the exchange rate adjusts such as to keep the following equation in equilibrium:

_S_ = _[P]_ _P_ = _SP_                  - (5.2)

_P_                 - [that is,]

where _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency per unit of foreign currency, so that a rise is a

depreciation and a fall is an appreciation of the domestic currency; _P_ is the domestic price level in the domestic

currency; and _P_ - is the foreign price in the foreign currency.

Equation (5.2) states that if a basket of goods costs £100 in the UK, and the same basket costs \$200 in the

USA, then the £/$ exchange rate should be £0.50/\$1. Tis means that the basket of goods has the same price in

both countries. If the exchange rate were above £0.50/$1, say at £0.60/$1, then the US bundle would cost a UK

citizen \$200 × 0.60 = £120, while the UK bundle would cost a US citizen £100/0.6 = \$166.66. Conversely, an

exchange rate below PPP, say at £0.40/\$1, would mean the US bundle of goods would cost a UK citizen \$200 ×

0.4 = £80, while the UK bundle would cost a US citizen £100/0.40 = \$250. According to the theory this would

lead to a rush to buy US goods and a depreciation of the pound until it was restored to £0.50/\$1.

Figure 5.3 depicts the PPP schedule which shows combinations of the domestic price level and exchange

rate which are compatible with PPP, given the foreign price level _P_ *. It has a slope given by _P_ - and implies that

an _x_ % rise in the domestic price level requires an _x_ % depreciation (rise) of the home currency to maintain

PPP. Points to the le, of the PPP schedule represent an overvaluation of the domestic currency in relation to

PPP, whereas points to the right show undervaluation in relation to PPP.

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

Te simple monetary model invokes the three assumptions set out above and then proceeds with the use

- f some accounting identities and behavioural assumptions to develop a theory of the balance of payments.

Te domestic monetary supply in the economy is made up of two components:

Ms � _D_                - _R_ (5.3)

where _M_ s is the domestic money base, _D_ is domestic bond holdings of the monetary authorities and _R_ is the

reserves of foreign currencies.

Te monetary base can come into circulation in one of two ways. First, the authorities may conduct an

- pen market operation (OMO), which involves the central bank purchasing Treasury bonds held by private
agents; this increases the central bank's monetary liabilities but increases its assets of domestic bond holdings,
which is the domestic component of the monetary base as represented by _D_ . Second, the authorities may
conduct a foreign exchange operation (FXO) which involves the central bank purchasing foreign currency
assets (money or foreign Treasury bonds) held by private agents. Tis again increases the central bank's
liabilities but increases its assets of foreign currency and foreign bonds which are represented by _R_ .

We can now rewrite equation (5.3) in di$erence form as:

d _M_ S [�] d _D_                - d _R_ (5.4)

Equation (5.4) states that any increase (decrease) in the domestic money supply can come about through

either an OMO, as represented by d _D_, or an FXO, as represented by d _R_ . Te relationship between the money

supply and reserves is illustrated in Figure 5.4.

International Finance

In the !gure, at point _D_ 1 all the domestic money supply is made up entirely of the domestic component,

since reserves are zero. For convenience we set the exchange rate of the domestic to foreign currency equal to

unity; this being the case an increase of 1 unit of foreign currency leads to an increase in the domestic money

supply of 1 unit, so that when reserves are _R_ 1 the money supply is _M_ 1, that is, _D_ 1 + _R_ 1.

An OMO will have the e$ect of shi,ing the _M_ s schedule by the amount of the increase in the central bank’s

domestic bond holdings. An OMO which increases the domestic component of the monetary base from _D_ 1

to _D_ 2 shi,s the money supply schedule from _M_ s1 to _M_ s2 and the total money supply rises from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 and

is represented by a movement from point A to point C. By contrast, an expansion of the money supply due to

a purchase of foreign currencies, that is an FXO, increases the country’s foreign exchange reserves from _R_ 1 to

_R_ 2. Tis, too, has the e$etc of raising the money stock from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 and is represented by a movement along

the money supply schedule _M_ s1 from point A to point B.

5.3 THE MONETARIST CONCEPT OF BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DISEQUILIBRIUM

Te monetarists view balance of payments surpluses and de!cits as monetary flow due to stock disequilibrium

in the money market. A de!cit in the balance of payments is due to an excess of the money supply in relation to

money demand, while a surplus is a monetary flow resulting from an excess demand for money in relation to

the stock money supply. Tus a balance of payments disequilibrium is merely a reflection of a disequilibrium

in the money market. In this sense the monetary flows are the 'autonomous' items in the balance of payments,

while the purchases and sales of goods/services and investments (long, medium and short-term) are viewed as

the accommodating items. Tis is completely the reverse of the Keynesian approach which views the current

account items as autonomous and the capital account and reserve changes as the accommodating items.

Tis di$erent way of looking at the balance of payments statistics is sometimes contrasted by saying that

Keynesians look at the balance of payments statistics from the 'top down' (that is, the current account), while

the monetarists look from the 'bottom up' (the change in reserves).

Monetarists observe that the overall balance of payments (BP) can be thought of as consisting of the current

account balance, the capital account balance and the changes in the authorities' reserves. Tat is:

_BP_                - _CA_                - _K_                - d _R_                - 0

so that:

_CA_               - _K_               - �d _R_ (5.5)

where _CA_ is the current account balance, _K_ is the capital account balance and d _R_ is the change in the authorities'

reserves. If the recorded d _R_ in the balance of payments accounts is positive, this means that the combined

current account and capital account are in de!cit. Tis implies that reserves have fallen as the authorities have

purchased the home currency with foreign currency reserves (remember a rise in foreign exchange reserves

is recorded as negative and a fall as positive in the balance of payments).

Equation (5.5) is a distinct way of viewing the balance of payments; increases in reserves due to purchases

- f foreign currencies constitute a surplus in the balance of payments, while falls in reserves resulting from
purchases of the domestic currency represent a de!cit in the balance of payments. If the authorities do not
intervene in the foreign exchange market, that is, the currency is le, to float, then reserves do not change and,
as far as the monetary view is concerned, the balance of payments is in equilibrium. Under a floating exchange

108

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

rate regime a current account de!cit must be !nanced by an equivalent capital inflow so that the balance of

payments is in equilibrium.

With this concept of a balance of payments surplus/de!cit in mind we can proceed to an analysis of the

e$ects of various shocks under both !xed and floating exchange rates.

Te model is in equilibrium when aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply so that there is no excess

demand for goods, which is given by the intersection of the aggregate demand and supply schedules at price

level _P_ 1 and output level _y_ 1 in Figure 5.5(b). Also, PPP holds in the foreign exchange market so that at price

level _P_ 1 and the exogenous foreign price level _P_ - the exchange rate compatible with PPP is given by _S_ 1 in

Figure 5.5(a). Finally, the money market is in equilibrium, with the money supply _M_ 1 made up of the domestic

component _D_ 1 and reserve component _R_ 1 and is equal to money demand in Figure 5.5(c). Te _M_ s schedule _M_ S1

cuts the money demand schedule _M_ d1. Te precise position of the money demand schedule is determined by

the domestic price level and domestic income level. Equilibrium in the money market also implies equilibrium

in the balance of payments.

We are now in a position to examine the e$ects of various shocks within the context of the monetary

approach to the balance of payments.

5.4 THE EFFECTS OF A DEVALUATION

Te monetary approach argues that a devaluation can only have an a$etc on the balance of payments by

influencing the demand for money in relation to the supply of money.

In Figure 5.6 the immediate e$etc of a devaluation of the exchange rate from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2 is to make domestic

goods competitive in relation to PPP. As domestic goods become more competitive compared to foreign

goods there is an increase in the demand for the domestic currency as represented by a shi, of the money

demand schedule from _M_ d1 to _M_ d2. Tis means that money demand _M_ 2 exceeds the money supply _M_ 1. Te

competitive advantage of the devaluation means that the balance of payments moves into surplus as domestic

residents demand fewer foreign goods/services, while foreigners demand more domestic goods. To prevent

the domestic currency appreciating, the authorities have to purchase the foreign currency with the new

domestic money base. Tis increases the reserves and leads to an expansion of the domestic money supply

which in turn raises aggregate demand for domestically produced goods. Te aggregate demand schedule

shi,s to the right from AD1 to AD2 and starts pushing up domestic prices until PPP is restored at price _P_ 2.

110

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

Once the domestic price level is at _P_ 2 and the money supply has increased to _M_ 2, real money balances will

be at their equilibrium level ( _M_ 1/ _P_ 1 = _M_ 2/ _P_ 2) and the competitive advantage of the devaluation has been o$set.

Te balance of payments will be back in equilibrium as money supply is once again equal to money demand.

In the long run, the e$etc of an _x_ % devaluation is to lead to an _x_ % rise in the domestic price level and an _x_ %

increase in the domestic money stock. In other words, the surplus resulting from a devaluation is merely a

transitory phenomenon.

Te monetary approach emphasizes that a devaluation will have a transitory bene!cial e$etc on the balance

- f payments only so long as the authorities do not simultaneously engage in an expansionary OMO. If the
authorities immediately increase the money stock to _M_ 2 via an OMO, there would be an immediate rise in
aggregate demand and domestic prices to _P_ 2 so that the competitive advantage conferred by a devaluation
would be eliminated.

Te important point derived from the monetary model concerning the e$etc of a devaluation is that

exchange rate changes are viewed as incapable of bringing about a lasting change in the balance of payments.

A devaluation or revaluation operates strictly by causing a disequilibrium in the money market, leading to a

de!cit or surplus in the balance of payments which continues only until equilibrium is restored in the money

market via reserve changes.

5.5 A MONETARY EXCHANGE RATE EQUATION

Before we compare and contrast the e$ects of various shocks under !xed and floating exchange rates we need

to consider how the exchange rate is determined in the context of our simple monetary model. As we have

seen in equation (5.1), which is repeated below as equation (5.6), the demand for money in the home country

is given by:

_M_ d = _kPy_ (5.6)

Tis being the case, we can postulate that the demand for money in the foreign economy is of a similar type,

given below as:

_M_ d* [=] _k P_           -           - _y_           - (5.7)

where _M_ d* denotes foreign money demand, _k_ - is the foreign nominal income elasticity of demand for money,

_P_ - is the foreign price level and _y_ - is real foreign income.

Te exchange rate is determined by PPP so that:

_P_

_S_ = (5.8)

_P_                   

In equilibrium, money demand is equal to the money supply in each country, so that:

_M_ s = _M_ d and _M_ s* = _M_ d* (5.9)

111

International Finance

Tis being the case, we can denote the relative money supply functions as equation (5.6) divided by (5.7),

replacing _M_ d and _M_ d* with _M_ s and _M_ s* from equation (5.9):

_MsMs_                       - = _k P_                       - _kPy_                       - _y_                       - (5.10)

Since _P_ / _P_ - = _S_ because of PPP, we can rewrite equation (5.10) as:

_Ms_ = _kSy_

_Ms_              - _k_              - _y_              - (5.11)

Solving the above equation for the exchange rate yields:

_S_

= _Ms_ / _Ms_ _ky k_ /  - _y_  

(5.12)

Equation (5.12) states that the exchange rate is determined by the relative supply and demand for the di$erent

national money stocks. An increase in the domestic money stock relative to the foreign money stock will

lead to a depreciation (rise) of the home currency, while an increase in domestic income relative to foreign

income leads to an appreciation (fall) of the home currency exchange rate – the reason being that an increase

in income leads to an increased transactions demand for the home currency leading to an appreciation. With

this simple model of exchange rate determination in mind we can proceed to analyse in more detail the e$ects

- f money supply, income changes and changes in the foreign price level.

5.6 A MONEY SUPPLY EXPANSION UNDER FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

If the exchange rate of a currency is !xed, this means that the authorities have to buy the currency when it is

in excess supply and sell the currency when it is in excess demand in the foreign exchange market to avoid

a currency depreciation or appreciation. When the authorities sell the domestic currency this leads to a rise

in their reserves of foreign currency. If the authorities buy the domestic currency they do so with foreign

currency, and so their reserves fall.

Let us now consider what happens if there is an expansionary OMO under a !xed exchange rate which

raises the money supply by a central bank purchase of Treasury bonds. In Figure 5.7 an expansionary OMO

shi,s the money supply schedule from _M_ s1 to _M_ s2 and increases the domestic money supply from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2, the

domestic component of the monetary base rising from _D_ 1 to _D_ 2. Te immediate e$etc is that domestic residents

have excess real money balances ( _M_ 2/ _P_ 1 > _M_ 1/ _P_ 1), that is, the money supply _M_ 2 exceeds money demand _M_ 1.

To reduce their excess real balances, residents increase aggregate demand for goods as represented by a shi,

- f the aggregate demand schedule from AD1 to AD2, and this puts upward pressure on domestic goods prices,
which rise from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2. At price _P_ 2 and !xed exchange rate _S_ 1 the domestic economy is uncompetitive in
relation to PPP as it !nds itself to the le, of the PPP schedule.

Te uncompetitive nature of the economy moves the balance of payments into de!cit. To prevent a

devaluation of the currency, the authorities have to intervene to purchase the domestic currency, causing

their reserves to start to decline below _R_ 1. Te purchase back of the domestic money supply starts to reduce

the excess money supply and at the same time aggregate demand starts to shi, back from AD2 towards AD1.

As the excess money balances are reduced, this puts downward pressure on the domestic price level which

falls back to its original level _P_ 1 so as to arrive back at PPP. Once the money supply returns to _M_ 1 along the _M_ S2

schedule the excess supply of money is eliminated and the economy is restored to equilibrium.

In the long run, the price level, output level and money stock return to their initial levels. Tus, an

increase in the domestic component of the monetary base from _D_ 1 to _D_ 2 will, because of the foreign exchange

intervention it necessitates to maintain a !xed exchange rate, lead to an equivalent fall in the reserves from _R_ 1

to _R_ 2. Tis fall in the reserves due to purchases of the home currency leads to a return of the money stock to its

- riginal level. Te fact that the money supply has to return to its original level can be explained by reference to
equation (5.12). As the parameters _S_, _M_ S*, _ky_ and _k_ - _y_ - are all !xed, any rise in _M_ S must eventually be reversed
for the equation to hold.

113

International Finance

Te monetary approach regards the balance of payments de!cits resulting from the expansion in the

money stock to be merely a temporary and self-correcting phenomenon. An expansion of the money supply

causes a temporary excess supply of money and a current and capital account de!cit which, to maintain the

!xed exchange rate, necessitates intervention in the foreign exchange market which eventually eliminates the

excess supply of the currency.

Tere are two circumstances under which a balance of payments de!cit can become more than a transitory

feature. One case is when the authorities practise sterilization of their foreign exchange operations. When

the authorities intervene to purchase their currency to prevent it being devalued there is a reduction of the

monetary base. Te authorities could try to o$set these money-base implications by conducting a further

- pen market purchase of bonds from the public; however, as we have seen, such an open market operation
causes a balance of payments de!cit requiring a further foreign exchange intervention. Hence, sterilization
policies can cause prolonged balance of payments de!cits. Te pursuit of such sterilization operations will be
limited by the extent of a country's reserves.

Another factor that can lead to a continuous de!cit would be if the surplus countries were prepared to

purchase the de!cit country's currency and hold it in their reserves. In such circumstances, the de!cit country

will have its exchange rate !xed by foreign central bank intervention; such a process can continue so long as

foreign central banks are prepared to accumulate the home country's currency in their reserves. Although

in this case reserve changes are zero, the de!cit is reflected as an increase in liabilities to foreign authorities.

5.7 A MONEY SUPPLY EXPANSION UNDER FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES

Under floating exchange rates the monetary approach maintains that there is no such thing as a balance of

payments de!cit or surplus as the authorities do not intervene to purchase or sell the domestic currency. Since

there are no changes in international reserves there is no balance of payments surplus or de!cit. Referring

to equation (5.6), as the change in reserves is zero, any current account de!cit (surplus) has to be o$set by a

net capital inflow (outflow) of a like amount. Figure 5.8 illustrates the e$ects of a monetary expansion under

floating exchange rates.

An expansionary OMO leads to a rise in the money stock from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 and creates excess money balances.

Te result is that the aggregate demand shi,s from AD1 to AD2 with demand _y_ 2 exceeding domestic output _y_ 1. Te

excess demand for goods translates into increased expenditure on foreign goods/services and investments leading

to a depreciation of the exchange rate from S1 to S2. As a result of the excess demand for goods the domestic price

level begins to rise and this leads to an increase in money demand, as reflected by an upward shi, of the money

demand function from _M_ d1 towards _M_ d2. As the domestic price level rises this increases the demand for money

leading to a contraction of aggregate demand along the AD2 schedule until equilibrium price level _P_ 2 is achieved.

In the long run, the e$etc of an _x_ % increase in the money stock is an _x_ % depreciation of the exchange rate

and an _x_ % increase in the domestic price level. Te rise in the price level induces a rise in the demand for

money so that the excess money balances created by the OMO are eliminated. With reference to equation

(5.12) we can see that, with the parameters _M_ s*, _ky_ and _k_ - _y_ - all !xed, any rise in _M_ s leads to a rise in the

exchange rate _S_ for the equation to hold.

Te case of floating exchange rates provides a clear contrast with the !xed exchange rate case. Under

!xed exchange rates an expansionary OMO leads to a disequilibrium in the money market which is resolved

by adjustment in the balance of payments and reserves held by the authorities. Under floating exchange

rates an expansion in the monetary base leads to a depreciation of the exchange rate and a rise in domestic

prices.%Under !xed exchange rates the authorities can no longer retain independent control of the money

supply – the quantity of money returns to its original level due to a gradual fall in the international reserves

held by the authorities. Whereas under floating exchange rates they can determine the amount of the money

supply, money market equilibrium is restored by changes in money demand brought about by changes in

the domestic price level and exchange rate. One of the arguments against !xed exchange rates is that the

authorities can no longer conduct independent monetary policies, while with floating exchange rates the

authorities are free to expand and contract the money supply to their desired levels.

Having contrasted the e$ects of a money supply expansion under both exchange rate regimes, we will now

consider the contrasting e$ects of changes in domestic income and foreign price level.

5.8 THE EFFECTS OF AN INCREASE IN INCOME UNDER FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

Within the context of the monetary approach to the balance of payments an increase in domestic income

can only have an e$ect on the balance of payments by influencing money demand in relation to the money

supply. Figure 5.9 shows the e$ects of an increase in domestic income under !xed exchange rates. Te increase

in real domestic income is represented by a rightward shi, of the aggregate supply schedule from AS1 to

AS2. As a result of the increase in domestic income the demand to hold money increases, which shi,s the

115

International Finance

money demand function from _M_ d1 to _M_ d2. Te result is that money demand _M_ 2 exceeds the money supply _M_ 1.

Te result is reduced expenditure on both domestic and foreign goods/services, which leads to a fall in the

domestic price level from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2. Te fall in the domestic price level means that at the !xed exchange rate _S_ 1

the country gains a competitive advantage and the current and capital account move into surplus. To prevent

an appreciation of the currency the authorities have to purchase the foreign currency with the newly created

money base, and as a result of the intervention in the foreign exchange market there is a rise in the reserves

and in the domestic money supply. Te increase in the money supply shi,s the aggregate demand schedule

from AD1 to AD2, which leads to a rise in the domestic price level back towards its PPP value _P_ 1. Once the

money stock has risen to _M_ 2 the excess money balances are eliminated.

Notice that in the long run, while the price level has returned to its original level _P_ 1, the money stock

has risen from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2 because of the transitory balance of payments surplus. Tis means that real money

balances are greater than before; that is, _M_ 2/ _P_ 1 is greater than _M_ 1/ _P_ 1. Te reason why this is possible is that all

the increased money stock is willingly held as transactions balances due to the increase in domestic income.

In terms of equation (5.12), given that _S_, _M_ S* and _k_ - _y_ - are all !xed, the increase in domestic income is o$set

by the rise in the domestic money supply.

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

5.9 THE EFFECTS OF AN INCREASE IN INCOME UNDER FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES

An increase in income under floating exchange rates has its impact on the exchange rate by influencing the demand

for money in relation to the supply of money, as shown in Figure 5.10. An increase in income leads to an increase

in the transactions demand for money and implies an excess supply of goods ( _y_ 2 > _y_ 1) at the existing price level _P_ 1.

Tis means that there is a downward pressure on the domestic price level which falls from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2 so as to equate

aggregate demand and supply. As the price level falls, the exchange rate appreciates so as to maintain PPP. Eventually,

new equilibrium is obtained at a lower domestic price level _P_ 2 and an exchange rate appreciation from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2.

In the long run, we note that there has been an increase in real money balances as _M_ 1/ _P_ 2 is greater than

_M_ 1/ _P_ 1. Again, the reason for this is that the increase in real domestic income raises the demand for transactions

balances, so that the increased real money balances are willingly held. Overall, the money demand schedule

did not shi, because, while the fall in domestic prices leads to less money demand, this is exactly o$set by the

rise in money demand due to the increase in real income. In terms of equation (5.12) the !xed parameters are

_M_ s, _M_ s* and _k_ - _y_ *; a rise in _ky_ due to an increase in income therefore implies an appreciation (fall) in _S_ .

Under !xed exchange rates with an increase in domestic income, eventual adjustment is obtained via an

increase in the domestic money supply and reserves so as to satisfy the increased money demand; while

under a floating exchange rate equilibrium is obtained by an appreciation of the exchange rate and a fall in the

domestic price level (to maintain PPP) with the domestic money supply unchanged.

5.10 AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN PRICES UNDER FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

Te e$ects of an increase in the foreign price level under !xed exchange rates are shown in Figure 5.11. An

increase in the foreign price level means that the PPP line swivels upwards from PPP1 to PPP2. Tis is because

at the exchange rate _S_ 1, a rise in the foreign price level means that at price level _P_ 1 the domestic economy is

now more competitive than PPP. Accordingly, to maintain PPP at the exchange rate _S_ 1 requires a rise in the

domestic price level to _P_ 2.

Te initial e$etc of the rise in foreign prices is to make domestic goods at price _P_ 1 more competitive

compared to foreign goods. Tis results in reduced consumption of foreign goods, creating a balance of

payments surplus and an increase in the demand for the domestic currency, which is shown by a shi, of the

money demand schedule from _M_ d1 to _M_ d2. To prevent an appreciation of the currency the authorities have to

purchase foreign currencies with the newly created domestic money base. Te reserves rise from _R_ 1 to _R_ 2 and

the money supply rises from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2. Te increased money supply and undervaluation of the currency in

relation to PPP lead to a shi, to the right of the aggregate demand schedule from AD1 to AD2 which pushes

up domestic prices from _P_ 1 towards _P_ 2 where PPP is restored. Once PPP is restored, the balance of payments

surplus ceases.

An important point that emerges from this analysis is that by choosing to peg its exchange rate the country

also has to eventually accept that movements in its domestic price level will be determined by changes in the

world price level. A country that decides to peg its exchange rate therefore runs the risk of imported inflation/

deflation. If foreign inflation is determined by changes in the foreign money supply, the monetary approach

suggests that a country that opts to !x its exchange rate must change its money supply in line with changes

in the foreign money supply. Hence, countries that opt to !x their exchange rates give up their monetary

autonomy. As we shall see in the next section, this is not the case with floating exchange rates.

5.11 AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN PRICES UNDER FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES

exchange rate the competitive advantage to the domestic economy is o$set by an appreciation of the currency

from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2 to maintain PPP at the existing domestic price level _P_ 1. Hence, with a floating exchange rate, the

domestic price level and aggregate demand and output are le, una$ected by the foreign price shock.

Te insulation of the domestic economy from the foreign price shock, under floating exchange rates with

the authorities able to operate an independent monetary policy, stands in contrast to the imported inflation

experienced under !xed exchange rates. One of the most powerful arguments made by the proponents of

floating exchange rates is that it gives the authorities the ability to avoid imported inflation/deflation. In e$ect

a floating exchange rate enables the authorities to pursue an independent monetary policy. Te exchange

rate will adjust to o$set an inflation di$erential and maintain PPP. Under !xed exchange rates the need to

maintain PPP means that an economy has to accept an inflation rate determined by the rate of growth of

the foreign money supply – hence monetary independence is lost. However, this independence of monetary

policy depends crucially upon the exchange rate adjusting in line with PPP.

5.12 IMPLICATIONS OF THE MONETARY APPROACH

Te distinctive feature of the monetary approach to the balance of payments is that money market disequilibrium

is seen as a crucial factor in provoking balance of payments disequilibrium. It is maintained that the crucial

decision of private agents concerns the level of their real money balances. With real output !xed, aggregate

expenditure is viewed as a function of real money balances rather than income. In the monetary model agents

decide !rstly upon the amount of real balances they wish to hold and then spend accordingly, and not the

- ther way round. In this sense, it is money decisions that matter and not the expenditure ones.

Te core of the monetary approach is that the demand for money function is a stable and predictable

function of relatively few variables. Variables such as the price elasticities of demand for goods and services

and foreign exchange are not considered to be important.

A major implication of the monetary approach is that in a !xed exchange-rate regime the authorities have

to accept a loss of control over their domestic monetary policy as the price of !xing the exchange rate. As we

have seen, any attempt to expand the domestic money supply under !xed exchange rates leads to a balance

- f payments de!cit and the need to purchase back the currency on the foreign exchange market. If foreign
prices rise then so does the domestic money supply and domestic price level. Under !xed exchange rates the
authorities lose the ability to pursue an independent monetary policy. Te only thing that they can do is to
control the composition of the monetary base between its domestic and foreign components. With a !xed
exchange rate, an increase in the domestic component of the monetary base leads to an equivalent fall in the
foreign component.

A further implication of the monetarist approach is that from the viewpoint of the balance of payments it

is irrelevant whether the change in the money supply results from an OMO or an FXO. As far as monetarists

are concerned both operations can bring about disequilibrium in the money market. An expansion of the

domestic monetary base under !xed exchange rates, whether arising from a purchase of domestic bonds or a

purchase of foreign currencies, causes an excess of real money balances. Te result is a balance of payments

de!cit which requires the authorities to intervene to support their currency – the reserves decline until the

money supply is brought back to its original level and excess balances are eliminated.

Te contrast between !xed and floating exchange rates in the monetary model is pronounced. Under !xed

exchange rates monetary policy is endogenously determined by the need to peg the exchange rate, while with

a floating exchange rate the country can exogenously determine its money supply because it is the exchange

rate and not monetary changes that restore equilibrium.

120

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

Tere is a split in the monetarist camp over the desirability of !xed as opposed to floating exchange rates.

Some monetarists argue that, because balance of payments de!cits and surpluses are necessarily transitory

and self-correcting, then countries should agree to permanently !x their exchange rates and enjoy the bene!ts

- f stable exchange rates. On the other hand, Milton Friedman long advocated that authorities should allow
exchange rates to float so that countries are le, free to determine their own rates of inflation and monetary
policies independently of other countries. Many other arguments are brought into play in the !xed versus
floating exchange rate debate and these are examined in more detail in Chapter 10.

5.13 EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE MONETARY APPROACH

Much of the empirical evidence on the monetary approach concerns the attempts to measure the so-called

'o$set coefficient’. Te o$set coefficient measures the extent to which an increase in the domestic component

- f the money base leads to a fall in reserves of a like amount in a !xed exchange rate regime, as postulated by
the monetary approach. To validate the monetary model, empirical estimates of the o$set coefficient under
!xed exchange rates require that it be equal to minus one, that is, an increase in the domestic component of
the monetary base leads to an exactly o$setting fall in the reserves. Some of the better-known estimates of the

- $set coefficient covering various countries and periods of the !xed exchange rate system that prevailed prior
to 1973 are presented in Table 5.1.

**Table 5.1** Empirical estimates of the o$set coefficient

statistically in line with the hypothesis. (c) Te t-statistics are in parentheses.

121

International Finance

As we can see, the empirical evidence on the monetary approach is somewhat mixed. In the Bean (1976)

and Kouri and Porter (1974) studies, the o$set coefficient is of the correct sign and statistically di$erent

from minus unity. One explanation that may help to explain the lower than expected o$set coefficient was

put forward by Magee (1976) who pointed out that exchange rates were not rigidly !xed under the Bretton

Woods system. Tis being the case, part of an increase in the domestic component of the monetary base may

be absorbed by a depreciation of the exchange rate rather than a fall in the reserves.

Nonetheless, Obstfeld (1982) pointed out that the estimates of Kouri and Porter (1974) and Bean (1976)

were likely to have been overestimates of the o$set coefficient because of the frequent practice of sterilization

- f foreign exchange interventions by central banks. Suppose a country expands the domestic component of
the monetary base; then there would be pressure for the currency to depreciate and the authorities would then
have to buy the domestic currency with a fall in their reserves. To prevent a fall in the money supply, authorities
typically try to sterilize the fall by further purchases of domestic bonds. To the extent that purchasing domestic
bonds (which will tend to lower domestic interest rates) does not induce further outflows, the o$set coefficient
will be greater than minus unity; that is, the expansion of the domestic component of the money base is
greater than the fall in reserves. Since the estimation procedures in the Kouri and Porter and Bean studies did
not take into account sterilization practices, they require re-estimation using more sophisticated econometric
procedures. In his study, Obstfeld (1982) found that the o$set coefficient for Germany changed from –0.55 to
an insigni!cant 0.003 when sterilization practices were accounted for. Obstfeld's result therefore casts grave
doubt on the monetary approach.

All the empirical estimates need to be treated with caution, even if the simultaneous-equation bias problem

has been accounted for by using appropriate econometric estimation techniques. Tis is because all the studies

assume that the price level, real output and interest rates are exogenous and una$ected by changes in the

money supply. Such assumptions have no grounding in economic theory and are most unlikely to be ful!lled

in the real world.

5.14 CRITICISMS OF THE MONETARY APPROACH

We need to emphasize that the monetary model presented in this chapter is not necessarily a model which all

advocates of the monetary approach to the balance of payments would be in full agreement with. Tere is a

wide spectrum of views that can be categorized within the monetarist camp. Some monetarists argue that an

increase in the domestic money supply might not be reflected exclusively in an equivalent fall in the reserves

under !xed exchange rates. For instance, if there is unemployment an expansionary monetary policy may

lead to some increase in output (reflected in a positive-sloping aggregate supply function) which, by raising

money demand, will reduce the devaluation pressures on the home currency. In this instance, reserves would

not need to fall in exact proportion to the initial rise in the money supply as some of the expansion would be

willingly held as transactions balances.

Some critics have argued that to regard the balance of payments as a monetary phenomenon is only true

in the sense that the balance of payments measures monetary flows between domestic and foreign residents.

They argue that it is quite wrong to regard the balance of payments de!cits and surpluses as exclusively due to

monetary decisions because the question of causation is an open issue. If suddenly economic agents decide to

spend more on foreign goods/services and foreign investments under a !xed exchange rate system there will

be a transitory de!cit in the balance of payments. Te de!cit then forces the authorities to buy the domestic

money base in the foreign exchange market. Te cause of the de!cit is the expenditure decision, not a decrease

in money demand which then leads to excess real money balances and a balance of payments de!cit. In other

122

The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments

words, causation can easily lead from expenditure decisions to changes in money demand rather than changes

in money demand inducing changes in expenditure behaviour.

A survey of the monetary approach by Boughton (1988) argued that nearly every assumption made by the

proponents is empirically open to question. Tere is ample evidence that money demand functions can be

highly unstable, that economies are rarely at full employment and that PPP is useless as a guide to exchange

rate movements (see Chapter 6). Although these assumptions hold reasonably well in the longer run, they

are very rarely ful!lled in the short run. Te empirical violation of these key assumptions must bring into

question the policy relevance of the monetary approach.

Te proponents of the monetary approach argue that it provides an insight into the short-run disequilibrium

in the balance of payments. Yet, since its assumptions of full employment, PPP and a stable money demand

function are highly questionable in the short run, there is clearly something wrong with using assumptions

that may be valid in the long run to explain what is happening in the short run. In this sense, the monetary

model's conclusions about the long-run consequences of changes in economic policy are probably more

insightful than its postulates about the short-run consequences.

Another criticism of the monetary approach is that no attention is paid to the composition of a de!cit and

surplus. If there is a large de!cit in the current account which is !nanced by an o$setting surplus in the capital

account, the monetarists argue that this means that there is no need for any policy concern with regard to

the balance of payments. Indeed, because any surplus or de!cit is necessarily a transitory feature representing

a stock disequilibrium in the money market which is necessarily self-correcting, a policy with regard to

the balance of payments is unnecessary. Such an approach ignores the dangers of increasing indebtedness

due to current account de!cits being !nanced by capital inflows. In the real world it is the increase in such

indebtedness that causes much concern for policy-makers of the countries concerned.

5.15 CONCLUSIONS

Te monetary approach provides a distinctive and clear analysis of the e$ects of a devaluation and monetary

expansion on the balance of payments. Its emphasis on disequilibrium in the balance of payments as being

a flow response to stock disequilibrium in the money market represents an important contribution to the

research on international economics.

Another signi!cant contribution of the monetary approach is that it provides a rich set of policy

recommendations. A country that opts to !x its exchange rate will lose its monetary autonomy and a

monetary expansion will lead to a temporary balance of payments de!cit, whereas a country that allows its

currency to float will have monetary autonomy but a monetary expansion then leads to a depreciation of its

currency. Hence, it provides a warning to policy-makers that reckless monetary expansion can lead to balance

- f payments problems under !xed exchange rates or a currency problem under floating exchange rates.

With regard to the e$ects of a devaluation of a currency, starting from a position of equilibrium, the

monetary approach suggests that there will be an unambiguous transitory surplus in the balance of payments.

Tis stands in contrast to the elasticity and absorption approaches which suggest that the e$ects are ambiguous.

It must be borne in mind, however, that the monetary model is referring to both the current and the capital

account, whereas the latter two are concerned exclusively with the current account. Finally, it needs to be

remembered that the monetary approach does not specify precisely how temporary the resulting surplus is:

presumably this varies on a country by country basis.

6.1 INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 1, we looked at what exactly the foreign exchange market is, introduced a number of di$ering

exchange rate concepts and examined a simple current account model of exchange rate determination. In

this chapter we will look at one of the earliest and simplest models of exchange rate determination known

as purchasing power parity (PPP) theory. An understanding of PPP is essential to the study of international

!nance. PPP theory has been advocated as a satisfactory model of exchange rate determination in its own

right, and provides a point of reference for the long-run exchange rate in many of the modern exchange rate

theories which we will examine in later chapters.

Having looked at PPP theory, we will proceed to examine how well-suited this theory is to explaining

actual exchange rate behaviour since the adoption of generalized floating in 1973. As we shall see, PPP theory

does not provide an adequate explanation of some of the observed features of floating exchange rates. Some of

the possible explanations for the failure of PPP are then discussed.

6.2 PPP THEORY AND THE LAW OF ONE PRICE

PPP is generally attributed to Gustav Cassell's writings in the 1920s, although its intellectual origins date back

to the writings of the nineteenth-century British economist David Ricardo. Te basic concept underlying PPP

theory is that arbitrage forces will lead to the equalization of goods prices internationally, once the prices of

goods are measured in the same currency. As such, the theory represents an application of the 'law of one

price'.

International Finance

_The law of one price_

Te law of one price simply states that, in the presence of a competitive market structure and the absence of

transport costs and other barriers to trade, identical products which are sold in di$erent markets will sell at

the same price when expressed in terms of a common currency.

Te law of one price is based on the idea of perfect goods arbitrage. Arbitrage occurs where economic

agents exploit price di$erences so as to provide a riskless pro!t. For example, if a car costs ¥3,000,000 in

Japan (the domestic economy) and the identical model costs \$30,000 in the USA (the foreign economy),

then according to the law of one price the exchange rate should be ¥3,000,000/\$30,000, which is ¥100/\$1. If

the exchange rate is ¥80/\$1 then a US car would cost a Japanese resident 30,000 × ¥80 = ¥2,400,000 while a

Japanese car would cost US residents 3,000,000/80 = \$37,500, that is, the yen is overvalued. Hence, Japanese

residents will buy US cars (saving ¥600,000), while US residents will not buy Japanese cars, so the yen will

depreciate on the foreign exchange market to its PPP value of ¥100/\$1. Conversely, if the exchange rate were

higher than this, say at ¥120/\$1, then a US car would cost a Japanese resident 30,000 × ¥120 = ¥3,600,000

while a Japanese car would cost US residents 3,000,000/120 = \$25,000, that is, the yen is undervalued. Hence,

Japanese residents will not buy US cars while US residents will buy Japanese cars, so the yen will appreciate on

the foreign exchange market to its PPP value of ¥100/\$1.

Te proponents of PPP argue that the exchange rate must adjust to ensure that the law of one price, which

applies only to individual goods, also holds internationally for identical _bundles_ - f goods.

6.3 ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE PPP

PPP theory comes in two forms: one is based on a strict interpretation of the law of one price and is termed

'absolute PPP', while the other is a 'weaker' variation known as 'relative PPP'. We shall !rst examine the

absolute version of the theory and then consider the relative version.

_Absolute PPP_

Te absolute version of PPP holds that if one takes a bundle of goods in one country and compares the price

- f that bundle with an identical bundle of goods sold in a foreign country, converted by the exchange rate into
a common currency of measurement, then the prices will be equal. For example, if a bundle of goods costs
\$100 in the US (foreign economy) and the same bundle costs ¥10,000 in Japan (domestic economy), then the
exchange rate de!ned as yen per dollar will be ¥10,000/$100 = ¥100/$1. Algebraically, the absolute version of
PPP can be stated as:

_P_

_S_ = (6.1)

_P*_

where _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, _P_ is the price of

a bundle of goods expressed in the domestic currency, and _P_ - is the price of an identical bundle of goods in

the foreign country expressed in terms of the foreign currency.

According to absolute PPP, a rise in the home price level relative to the foreign price level will lead to a

proportional depreciation of the home currency against the foreign currency. In our example, if the price

- f the Japanese bundle rises to ¥12,000 while the price of the US bundle remains at \$100, then according to
absolute PPP the yen will depreciate to ¥120/\$1.

128

Purchasing Power Parity Theory and Floating Exchange Rate Experience

_Relative PPP_

Te absolute version of PPP is, even proponents of the theory generally acknowledge, unlikely to hold precisely

because of the existence of transport costs, imperfect information and the distorting e$ects of tari$ and nontari$ barriers to trade.

Nonetheless, it is argued that a weaker form of PPP known as relative PPP can be expected to hold even

in the presence of such distortions. Put simply, the relative version of PPP theory argues that the exchange

rate will adjust by the amount of the inflation di$erential between two economies. Algebraically this is

expressed as:

%�� _S_ %� _P_           - %� _P_           - (6.2)

where %/ _S_ is the percentage change in the exchange rate, %/ _P_ is the domestic inflation rate, and %/ _P_ - is the

foreign inflation rate.

According to the relative version of PPP, if the inflation rate in Japan is 5% whilst that in the United States

is 2%, the yen exchange rate should be expected to depreciate by approximately 3% against the dollar. Te

absolute version of PPP does not have to hold for this to be the case. For example, the exchange rate may be

¥100/\$1 while the Japanese bundle of goods costs ¥12,000 and the US bundle of identical goods costs \$100, so

that absolute PPP does not hold (this requires a rate of ¥120/\$1). But if Japanese prices go up 5% to ¥12,600

and the US bundle goes up 2% to \$102, the relative version of PPP predicts the yen will depreciate 3% to

¥103/\$1 (even though absolute PPP requires ¥123.53/$1 = ¥12,600/$102).

6.4 A GENERALIZED VERSION OF PPP

One of the major problems with PPP theory, as we have so far examined it, is that it suggests that PPP holds

for all types of goods. However, a more generalized version of PPP that provides some useful insights makes a

distinction between traded and non-traded goods. Traded goods are susceptible to the rigours of international

competition, be they exports or import-competing industries such as most manufactured goods. Non-traded

goods are those that cannot be traded internationally at a pro!t, such as houses and certain services such as a

haircut or restaurant food.

Te point of the traded/non-traded goods distinction is that on _a priori_ grounds PPP is more likely to hold

for traded than for non-traded goods. Tis is because the price of traded goods will tend to be kept in line by

international competition, while the price of non-traded goods will be determined predominately by domestic

supply and demand considerations. For example, if a car costs ¥3,000,000 in Japan and \$30,000 in the USA,

arbitrage will tend to keep the yen–dollar rate at ¥100/\$1. However, if the price of a house costs ¥40,000,000

in Japan and \$250,000 in the USA and the exchange rate is ¥100/\$1, arbitrage forces do not easily come into

play (unless fed-up Japanese citizens emigrate to America pushing up US house prices and lowering Japanese

prices). Similarly, if a haircut costs ¥4,000 in Japan but \$30 in the USA and the exchange rate is ¥100/\$1, then

¥1,000 could be saved, though only insane people in Japan would travel to the USA for a haircut knowing that

they can 'save' ¥1,000, because of the time and transport costs involved.

We will now consider the importance of the tradables/non-tradables distinction for PPP when aggregate

price indices are made up of both tradables and non-tradables. In the !rst instance, we assume that PPP holds

for tradable goods, which means:

_P_ T = _S P_ T* (6.3)

129

International Finance

where _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, _P_ T is the price

- f traded goods in the domestic country measured in terms of the domestic currency, and _P_ T* is the price of
traded goods in the foreign country measured in terms of the foreign currency.

Te aggregate price index ( _P_ I) for the domestic economy is made up of a weighted average of the price

- f both tradable ( _P_ T) and non-tradable goods ( _P_ N), priced in the domestic currency. Likewise, the foreign
aggregate price index ( _P_ I*) is made up of a weighted average of the price on tradables ( _P_ T*) and non-tradables
( _P_ N*), priced in the foreign currency. Tis gives:

_P_ I _P_ N (1 ) _P_ T (6.4)

where * is the proportion of non-traded goods in the domestic price index; and

_P_ I* _P_ N* (1 ) _P_ T* (6.5)

where * is the proportion of non-traded goods in the foreign price index.

Dividing equation (6.4) by (6.5) we obtain:

_P_ I

 - _P_ N* - (1 - �)

_P_ N - (1 - �) _P_ T

If we divide the numerator by _P_ T and the denominator by _SP_ T* which, because of the assumption of PPP for

tradable goods, are equivalent expressions (see equation 6.3) we obtain:

_P_ I - ( _P_ N / _P_ T

Tis can be rearranged to give the solution for the exchange rate as:

- (6.8)
- _P_ I - [�] ( _P_ N* / _P_ T* - (1 - �

T

Equation (6.8) is an important modi!cation to our simple PPP equation, because PPP no longer necessarily

holds in terms of aggregate price indices due to the multiplicative term on the right-hand side. Furthermore,

the equation suggests that the relative price of non-tradables relative to tradables will influence the exchange

rate. If the domestic price of non-tradables rises relative to tradables this will lead to an appreciation (fall) of

the home currency. Te reason is that PPP holds only in terms of tradable goods. A rise in the relative price of

non-tradables, while keeping the aggregate price index constant, implies that the price of tradables must have

fallen, which will then induce an appreciation of the exchange rate (to maintain PPP for tradable goods) even

though the aggregate price index has remained unchanged. Conversely, a rise in the price of tradables, while

holding the aggregate price index constant, leads to a depreciation of the exchange rate to maintain PPP for

tradable goods.

130

Purchasing Power Parity Theory and Floating Exchange Rate Experience

Te tradable/non-tradable distinction serves as a warning when testing for PPP. Testing for PPP using

price indices based on tradable goods prices is likely to lead to better results than when using aggregate price

indices made up of both types of goods. Exchange rate movements induced by changes in the relative prices

between tradable and non-tradable goods represent real exchange rate changes. Among the factors that can

lead to such relative price changes are di$ering rates of productivity in the traded and non-traded sectors of

the economy, and changing consumer demand patterns.

6.5 MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS IN TESTING FOR PPP

Many of the proponents of PPP argued prior to the adoption of floating exchange rates that exchange rate

changes would be in line with levels predicted by PPP theory. Before examining some of the empirical evidence

- n PPP theory, it is worth considering some of the practical problems involved in testing for PPP. One of the
major problems is to decide whether or not the theory is supposed to be applicable to both traded goods and
non-traded goods, or applicable to only one of those categories. At !rst sight PPP theory seems more readily
applicable to traded goods, but some authors have argued that the distinction between the two categories is
fuzzy and that there are mechanisms linking both traded and non-traded goods prices. For example, some
traded goods are used as inputs into the production of non-traded goods, and vice versa (for example, shop
rents di$er in price from the USA compared to, say, Mexico).

Te argument over whether PPP should be applied to traded goods only, or whether a more general

price index made up of both traded and non-traded goods should be used, is important for the empirical

testing of PPP theory. If the theory is supposed to be applicable to traded goods only, then the price index

used for testing the theory needs to be made up only of traded goods. Conversely, if the theory is applicable

to both traded and non-traded goods then a more general price index should be employed. In practice,

researchers who test PPP theory for traded goods typically use wholesale or manufacturing price indices

which are normally dominated by traded goods, while if the test involves both traded and non-traded goods

then consumer price indices which weight both classes of goods are generally used. An overall problem

facing researchers, whichever price index they decide to employ, is that PPP is only expected to hold for

similar baskets of goods, but national price indices typically attach di$erent weights to di$erent classes of

goods. For instance, consumer price indices in underdeveloped economies typically have a high weighting

for food, while those in developed countries have a lower weighting for food and a higher weighting for

consumer goods.

Another statistical problem in testing for PPP is that the base period for the test should ideally be one

where PPP holds approximately. In addition, there are divergences of view over the time span during which

PPP can be expected to assert itself: a strong version of PPP would suggest it holds on a monthly basis,

whereas progressively weaker versions would argue that it can be expected to hold only on a quarterly, sixmonthly or yearly and beyond basis. Bearing in mind some of these practical problems, we will proceed to

look at some of the empirical evidence for PPP theory.

6.6 EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON PPP

Tere are a variety of methods of testing for PPP, including graphical evidence, simplistic data analysis and

more sophisticated econometric evidence. We !rst look at the graphical evidence.

_Graphical evidence on PPP_

Figure 6.1 plots the actual exchange rate and the exchange rate that would have maintained PPP, for various

currencies, and shows that the exchange rate has diverged considerably from that suggested by purchasing

power parity.

In Figure 6.1(a) it can be seen that PPP does not do at all well in tracking the dollar–pound rate – it

performs reasonably well up to 1977 but between mid-1976 and mid-1981 there is a dramatic appreciation

- f the pound, while PPP would have predicted a depreciation (due to higher UK inflation). A massive dollar
appreciation a,er 1981 leads to the restoration of PPP in early 1984. Terea,er the pound was mainly

- vervalued, especially in the run up to the global !nancial crisis, which resulted in a rapid depreciation of the
pound. Following the Brexit referendum there was a period of undervaluation in relation to PPP but by late
2020 the pound was close to its PPP rate. Neither is the Deutschmark–dollar rate (Figure 6.1(b)) explained by
PPP, with the dollar generally undervalued in relation to PPP up to early 1981. Terea,er the dollar becomes
substantially overvalued in relation to PPP up until mid-1986 when it once again becomes undervalued in
relation to PPP. However, taking a long-run view PPP seems to have worked with the exchange rate by late
2020 in line with what had been predicted by PPP in 1973. Again, with the yen–dollar (Figure 6.1(c)) there
are sustained and marked departures from PPP using 1973 as the starting point; nonetheless if 1976 was used
as the starting point the !t would be a lot better and the relatively higher inflation in the US has clearly been
associated with a depreciation of the US dollar.

When it comes to tracking the French franc, Italian ira to the Deutschmark and Deutschmark pound

rate (Figures 6.1 (d-f)) the plots reveal that, although there are deviations from PPP, the order of magnitude

is much smaller than against the dollar and that PPP does a reasonable job. Tis is not that surprising since

transport costs and trade barriers between France, Italy, the UK and Germany are small because of their

geographical proximity, and membership of the European Union (up until the end of the transition period

January 2021 in the case of the UK) prohibits the use of trade barriers between its members. Tese conditions

facilitate the goods-market arbitrage that PPP is so heavily dependent on.

Figure 6.1(g) depicts the evolution of the dollar–euro parity which has shown very substantial and

persistent departures from PPP since the euro commenced trading in the foreign exchange market in January

1999. In the !rst three years there was a substantial depreciation of the euro and periods of undervaluation in

relation to PPP, and since 2002, a substantial appreciation of the euro and tendency to large overvaluation of

the euro in relation to PPP.

It is noticeable in all the plots that, although the exchange rate is frequently far from PPP, it does have a

tendency to go back towards the PPP rate over the longer run. Tis provides some evidence that PPP may be

a useful guide for the determination of the long-run exchange rate.

_Econometric evidence on PPP_

Apart from comparing the exchange rate that would have maintained PPP with the actual exchange rate, we

can test for PPP by use of regression analysis. In log form the two simple hypotheses may be expressed as

follows:

Absolute PPP: ln _S_ t = _a_ 1 + _a_ 2(ln _P_ t – ln _P_ t*) + _u_ t

Relative PPP: /ln _S_ t = _a_ 1 + _a_ 2(/ln _P_ t – /ln _P_ t*) + _u_ t

where / is the one-period change in the variable, ln _S_ t is the log of the domestic exchange rate per unit of

foreign currency, ln _P_ t is the log of domestic tradable goods prices, ln _P_ t* is the log of foreign tradable goods

prices, and _u_ t is a random error with zero mean and normal distribution.

In both cases, for PPP to hold, the regression estimates would yield _a_ 1 = 0 and _a_ 2 = 1. Te price and exchange

rate variables are put into log form because the change in the log of a variable approximates to the percentage

change in the variable. Table 6.1 contains some up-to-date empirical estimates of the relative version of PPP

using quarterly data for the period 1973Q1 to 2020Q3 for a variety of currencies (having the system in !rstdi$erence form makes the validity of the test somewhat superior as it has the e$etc of detrending the data).

Te regressions recreate the old Deutschmark, French franc and Italian lira by using their !xed exchange rates

against the euro for the period from 1 January 1999.

Te regression estimates provide additional support for the graphical analysis in the case of the relative

PPP version. For the pound–dollar rate the coefficient _a_ 2 is wrongly signed and statistically insigni!cant. For

the dollar–Deutschmark the coefficient _a_ 2 is well below the hypothesized value of unity and is not signi!cantly

di$erent from zero, leading to a clear rejection of PPP. PPP does not help much with the yen–dollar rate either:

in the two sub-periods the coefficient _a_ 2 is negative and not signi!cantly di$erent from zero for the full sample

and sub-sample periods. For the the entire period PPP does somewhat better for the lira–dollar rate and the

sub-period 1973Q1 to 1996Q2. European country currencies seem to perform better in PPP tests against the

Deutschmark than they do against the dollar.

Te overall evidence on the PPP hypothesis is not very supportive: the graphical evidence and econometric

results show that for some rates the deviations from PPP are both substantial and prolonged. Tis is especially

the case for the major currencies against the US dollar, where PPP performs abysmally. While PPP has a

better explanatory power for a number of currencies against the Deutschmark, the results are still not that

supportive, as the estimates for the coefficient a2 can di$er substantially in the sub-periods and are o,en not

signi!cantly di$erent from zero. In summary, there is much more to exchange rate determination than PPP.

For an excellent review of the literature on PPP the reader is referred to Sarno and Taylor (2002).

6.7 SUMMARY OF THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR PPP

1. Our results are very much in line with those presented by Frenkel (1981) that show PPP performs

better for countries that are geographically close to one another and where trade linkages are high.

Tis is also borne out in the graphical plots – the biggest divergences between the actual and PPP

exchange rates are between the pound, Deutschmark and yen against the dollar; while the lira and

French franc rates against the Deutschmark are quite accurately tracked by PPP. Not only are France,

Italy and Germany in close proximity to one another, so minimizing transport costs, but they are also

members of the European Union in which there exist no tari$ impediments to restrict trade among

them.

2. Te plots of the exchange rates and PPP rates show that there have been both substantial and

prolonged deviations from PPP which have frequently been reversed.

3. Exchange rates have been much more volatile than the corresponding national price levels (see

Frenkel and Mussa, 1980; MacDonald, 1988). Tis again is contrary to the PPP hypothesis in which

exchange rates are only supposed to be as volatile as prices. Figure 6.2 shows that the monthly

volatility of the $/£ exchange rate is signi!cantly higher than the di$erence in the monthly changes in

the US and UK price indices.

4. Empirically, PPP holds better in the long run than in the short run. A study by Lothian (1997) using

data from 22 OECD countries covering the period 1974–91 found that, although there have been

substantial and prolonged short-run deviations from relative PPP, it cannot be rejected over the

longer run being between three and six years. Tis long-run validity of PPP has also been supported

by Sarno and Taylor (2002) using the latest econometric techniques. Further support for the long-run

validity of relative PPP is obtained using panel data techniques for 19 industrial and 26 developing

countries by Coakley et al. (2005).

Te currencies of countries that had very high inflation rates relative to trading partners, such as

Israel, Brazil and Argentina in the 1980s, experienced rapid depreciations reflecting their relatively

high inflation rates. Tis suggests that PPP was the dominant force in determining their exchange

rates during that period.

6. Overall, PPP holds better for traded goods than for non-traded goods, and this is con!rmed in a

study by Officer (1986). In addition, a striking and major empirical regularity is that the price of nontraded goods tends to be more expensive in rich countries than in poor countries, once prices are

converted into a common currency. We will investigate this phenomenon further in section 6.10, as

well as the important implications about how we measure per capita GDP.

7. A number of papers have estimated the half-life of corrections of deviations from PPP. Te half-life

is the time it takes in years to correct 50% of a deviation from PPP. In an influential paper by Rogo$

(1996), this was estimated to be three to !ve years. Tis shows that deviations from PPP are not

speedily corrected. Rogo$ (1996, p. 647) refers to the 'PPP puzzle': 'the purchasing power puzzle

is this. How can one reconcile the enormous short-run volatility of real exchange rates with the

extremely slow rate at which shocks appear to damp out?' However, Sarno and Taylor (2002) dispute

the validity of the half-lives reported by Rogo$ in the case of large deviations from PPP, which they

argue are far more speedily corrected.

8. A study by Xu (2003) emphasizes the importance of using the correct price index in PPP tests. PPP

is much less likely to hold if one uses consumer price indices (CPI), than if wholesale price indices

(WPI) are used. Signi!cantly better is the use of a tradables price index (TPI). In his study Xu

estimates the half-life of deviations from PPP to be somewhat lower than Rogo$'s three to !ve years;

he calculates the half-life to be around two years if CPI or WPI indices are used, and as low as one

year if a TPI index is used.

**Box 6.1 The hamburger standard**

In 1986, _Te Economist_ magazine launched a 'Big Mac index'. Te 'McDonald standard' is based upon

the concept of PPP, the price index for measuring PPP being simply the price of a Big Mac hamburger.

In January 2020 the average price of a Big Mac in the USA was \$5.71 and in Switzerland it was 6.50 Swiss

francs. Dividing the Swiss franc price by the US dollar price yields an implied PPP of approximately 1.14

Swiss francs per dollar compared with an actual exchange rate of 0.94 Swiss francs per dollar, yielding

a 21.3% overvaluation of the Swiss franc. Table 6.2 presents the measurements of over/undervaluation

  - f the dollar in terms of PPP against various other currencies using hamburger prices. According to the
table, one of the most undervalued currencies is the Chinese yuan (a Beijing Big Mac costs only \$3.10),
while South Africa’s Rand is the most undervalued currency (a big Mac costs \$1.86).

6.8 EXPLAINING THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF PPP THEORY

Tere have been many explanations put forward to explain the general failure of exchange rates to adjust in

line with PPP theory. We will now proceed to look at some of the most important.

_Statistical problems_

We have seen that PPP theory is based upon the concept of comparing identical baskets of goods in two

economies. An important problem facing researchers in this respect is that di$erent countries usually attach

di$erent weights to various categories of goods and services when constructing their price indices, which

means it is difficult to compare like with like when testing for PPP. Tis factor is probably very signi!cant

when testing for PPP between developed and developing economies which have vastly di$erent consumption

patterns. People in developing countries usually spend a high proportion of their income on basics such as food

and clothing, while these take up a much smaller proportion of people's expenditure in developed economies.

Di$ering consumption baskets are not of such signi!cance when comparing most industrialized economies

since consumers have fairly similar consumption baskets. Tere is, however, a problem posed by the di$ering

quality of goods consumed. Although British and German consumers both spend roughly the same proportion

- f their incomes on cars, the Germans tend to drive German makes like BMW and Audi while the British tend
to drive Fords and Japanese cars which are generally cheaper. We do not necessarily expect PPP to hold in
terms of cars between the two countries because once again we are not comparing like with like.

_Transport costs and trade impediments_

Studies such as Frenkel (1981) which note that PPP holds better when the countries concerned are

geographically close and trade linkages are high can partly be explained by transport costs and the existence

- f other trade impediments such as tari$s. If a bundle of goods costs £100 in the UK and \$200 in the USA,
PPP would suggest an exchange rate of £0.50/\$1. If transport costs are £20 then the exchange rate could
lie anywhere between £0.40/\$1 and £0.60/\$1 without bringing arbitrage forces into play. Nonetheless, since
transport costs and trade barriers do not change dramatically over time they are not sufficient explanations
for the failure of the relative versions of PPP.

_Imperfect competition_

One of the notions underlying PPP is that there is sufficient international competition to prevent major

departures of the price of a good in one country exceeding that in another. However, it is clear that there

are considerable variations in the degree of competition internationally, and these di$erences mean that

multinational corporations can o,en get away with charging di$erent prices in di$erent countries. In fact,

the conditions necessary for successful price discrimination, namely di$erences in the willingness to pay

- f di$erent sets of consumers, the ability to prevent resale from the low-cost to high-cost market and some
degree of monopoly power, are for the most part more likely to hold between rather than within countries.

_Differences between capital and goods markets_

PPP is based upon the concept of goods arbitrage and has nothing to say about the role of capital movements.

In a classic paper which we shall be looking at in more detail in Chapter 7, Rüdiger Dornbusch (1976)

hypothesized that, in a world where capital markets are highly integrated and goods markets exhibit slow

142

Purchasing Power Parity Theory and Floating Exchange Rate Experience

price adjustment, there can be substantial prolonged deviations of the exchange rate from PPP. Te basic idea

is that in the short run goods prices in both the home and foreign economies can be considered as !xed, while

the exchange rate adjusts quickly to new information and changes in economic policy. Tis being the case,

exchange rate changes represent deviations from PPP which can be quite substantial and prolonged.

_Productivity differentials_

As mentioned, one striking empirical observation that is well documented is that when prices of similar

baskets of both traded and non-traded goods are converted into a common currency, the aggregate price

indices tend to be higher in rich countries than in poor countries. In other words, a dollar buys more goods

in, say, Mexico than in the United States. Further, evidence shows that prices of tradable goods are nowhere

as dissimilar internationally as those of non-traded goods. Consequently the overall higher price index in rich

countries is mainly due to the fact that non-tradable goods prices are higher in developed than developing

countries.

An explanation for the lower relative price of non-tradables in poor countries has been put forward

separately by Bela Balassa (1964) and Paul Samuelson (1964). Tis is worth considering in detail. As we shall

see, the model argues that the lower price of goods in the non-traded sector in developing countries is mainly

due to lower labour productivity in the tradables sector compared to developed countries. Or, equivalently,

the higher price of non-traded goods in a developed nation (compared to non-traded goods in the developing

country) is mainly due to higher labour productivity in the traded sector compared to labour productivity in

the tradables sector of developing countries.

6.9 THE BALASSA–SAMUELSON MODEL

Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) argue that labour productivity in rich countries is higher than that in

poor countries. Furthermore, this productivity di$erential occurs predominately in the tradables rather than

the non-tradables sector. A Mexican barber tends to be as efficient as his American counterpart (as measured

by haircuts per day), but a Mexican car worker is less efficient than his American counterpart (as measured by

cars produced per day). Wages are assumed to be the same in the tradables and non-tradables sectors within

each economy and positively related to productivity. Prices are determined positively by wages and inversely

by productivity. Tese assumptions lead to the following set of relationships:

In the poor country:

_P_ N _= W_ N _/Q_ N and _P_ T _= W_ T _/Q_ T (6.9)

In the rich economy:

_P_ N* = _W_ N*/ _Q_ N* and _P_ T* = _W_ T*/ _Q_ T* (6.10)

where _P_ N represents non-tradables prices, _P_ T represents traded goods prices, _Q_ N is output per worker in the

tradables sector, _Q_ T is output per worker in the non-tradables sector, and an asterisk denotes a high income

(high productivity) economy.

Wage rates are the same in both the industries in each of the two economies:

_W_ N _= W_ T and _W_ N _* = W_ T _*_ (6.11)

143

International Finance

Productivity is higher in the rich economy's tradables sector than in the poor country's, but in the nontradables sector productivity in the rich and poor countries are the same. Tis means that:

_Q_ T _* > Q_ T and _Q_ N _* = Q_ N (6.12)

Finally, PPP is assumed to hold only for traded goods:

_S_ = _P_ T/ _P_ T* (6.13)

Te price ratio of traded to non-traded goods in each country is given by:

_P_ N

_P_

N

- � (6.14)

T

and

_P_

N* 

_P_ T*

- � - (6.15)

Since there is higher productivity in the rich economy's tradables sector, then the relative price of nontradables to tradables will be higher in the rich country, making 0* > 0.

Rewriting equations (6.14) and (6.15) as:

_P_ N

_P_

N

- � (6.16)

T

and

_SP_ N*

- �* (6.17)
  - �*

_SPT_ 

Since PPP holds for the tradables sector, making _P_ T = _SP_ T*, then the denominator of equations (6.16) and

(6.17) are the same. Consequently, since 0* > 0, the price of non-tradables in the rich economy exceeds the

price of non-tradables in the developing country, that is, _SP_ N* > _P_ N; i.e., PPP does not work for non-traded

goods. Te reason is that low wages in the developing country, due to low productivity in its traded sector, also

lead to a relatively low price for its non-traded goods even though its productivity in this sector is the same

as in developed countries. On the other hand, high productivity in the rich country's tradables sector leads

to high wages in its non-tradables sector, even though it is no more efficient than the poor country in that

sector. Consequently, when we use the exchange rate to examine non-tradable goods prices we !nd that they

are higher in developed countries than in developing ones.

Te Balassa–Samuelson model is helpful in explaining why it is that rich countries tend to have overall

high price indices and poor countries have low price indices when aggregate baskets of traded and nontraded goods are converted into a common currency such as the US dollar. Furthermore, it helps explain

why the ratio of non-traded to traded prices tends to be higher in developed economies than in developing

countries.

144

Purchasing Power Parity Theory and Floating Exchange Rate Experience

It is clear that PPP based on tradable goods alone will undervalue the purchasing power and living standards

- f people in poor countries because they can purchase more non-traded goods per dollar than can people in
rich countries, even if PPP holds for traded goods (see section 6.10). Tis means that when comparing per
capita income levels between countries such as Mexico and the United States in dollar terms this should not
be done at the PPP rate for tradable goods; rather, the proportion of Mexican expenditure on non-tradables
should be valued at US non-tradables prices, thereby raising the value of Mexican incomes in US dollar terms.

Te productivity di$erential theory may also have some application in explaining divergences from PPP

in terms of aggregate price indices between developed countries. For instance, since the Second World War

Japan has consistently had higher productivity in its tradables sector than the United States. According to the

Balassa–Samuelson model, this means that the real value of the yen should appreciate against the dollar as

the higher productivity of Japanese tradables workers leads to a fall in Japanese traded goods prices relative to

US traded goods prices and therefore an appreciation of the yen to maintain PPP for tradable goods. Richard

Marston (1986) found evidence that in the period 1973–83, Japanese productivity growth in its tradables

sector outstripped US tradables productivity. During that period the yen appreciated by some 9% in real terms

against the dollar.

Although the Balassa–Samuelson model helps explain why PPP does not necessarily hold in terms of

aggregate price indices, it is only a partial explanation. By assumption the theory cannot explain the failure of

PPP to hold for traded goods.

6.10 PER CAPITA INCOME LEVELS, THE RELATIVE SIZES OF ECONOMIES AND THE

IMPORTANCE OF PPP ESTIMATES

Te World Bank keeps a very keen eye on the per capita income levels of developing countries, since the

poorest countries in the world are o,en deemed to be the countries that policy-makers wish to direct aid

towards and provide access to cheap !nance for developmental purposes. Te fact that PPP tends not to

hold, especially between developed and developing nations, is of considerable importance in this respect. It

is well documented that, in particular, the price of non-tradable goods and services in developing countries

is signi!cantly lower than in developed countries. Tis means that \$100 will tend to buy far more haircuts,

restaurant meals, hotel time and many other goods and services when transferred into the local currency of

a developing country than in a developed nation like the United States, the United Kingdom or Japan, simply

because PPP does not hold. In particular, the exchange rates of developing countries tend to be noticeably

undervalued in terms of purchasing power for goods and services. Consider the case of the Chinese renminbi

versus the US dollar: the market exchange rate in March 2021 was approximately 6.50 renminbi per US dollar.

Imagine, however, that when we change \$100 into renminbi to obtain 650 renminbi we are then able to make

66% more goods and services in China than in the USA. Te appropriate PPP exchange rate in terms of goods

and services would then be 6.50/1.66 = 3.90 renminbi per dollar. If the exchange rate was at the calculated PPP

rate then \$100 would convert to 390 renminbi which would purchase the same bundle of goods and services

in China as \$100 buys in the USA. Tink now of the implications for calculations of GDP per capita. If the

United States GDP per capita was \$65,000 while the Chinese per capita income was 65,000 renminbi, then,

using the market exchange rate (6.5RMB/\$1), the Chinese income per capita would only be \$10,000 which is a

mere 15.4% of that of the United States. However, if \$10,000 buys 66% more goods and services in China, then

we need to multiply the Chinese income by 1.66 to get a PPP per capita income, which is \$16,600 (the same

as dividing the Chinese GDP per capita of 65,000 renminbi by the PPP rate of 3.90). Tis would suggest that

Chinese income levels are closer to 25.5% of those of the United States. Te GDP per capita based on PPP is

therefore a more reliable guide (albeit highly imperfect!) to relative living standards in the two countries than

using the market exchange rate which does not reflect PPP.

Te previous example calculation is by no means far from reality in the case of the United States and

China. Table 6.3 shows gross national income (GDP) per capita according to the World Bank using both the

Atlas method and the PPP method. Te Atlas method mainly uses an average of market exchange rates over

the past three years to calculate income per capita in terms of US dollars, making some allowance for recent

inflation (this methodology helps to iron out sudden changes in relative !gures due merely to large year-toyear exchange rate changes compared to using purely current market exchange rates), and these are compared

to the estimates of GDP per capita using PPP estimates.

Not only do PPP adjustments make a signi!cant di$erence to GDP per capita estimates, they also make

a big di$erence to the importance of the relative size of di$erent economies. As Table 6.4 shows, the largest

economy in 2019 using market exchange rates was the United States with China second, measuring at 66.9%

- f the size of the US economy, and India !,h. If, however, we measure the relative sizes of economies based
upon PPP exchange rate estimates then China becomes the largest economy in the world. China's GDP is now
9.5% larger than the size of the US economy, with India jumping from !,h to becoming the world's third
biggest economy!

6.11 CONCLUSIONS

At the time of the adoption of floating exchange rates it was widely believed that they would adjust in line with

changes in national price levels as predicted by PPP theory. However, the experience with floating rates has

shown that there can be substantial and prolonged deviations of exchange rates from PPP. A clear conclusion

is that, in the short to medium term, international goods arbitrage is nowhere near as powerful as proponents

- f PPP had presupposed.

Tere are many possible explanations for these deviations from PPP. Among the strongest candidates is

that the theory relies too heavily on goods arbitrage and has no role for the international capital movements

which have grown enormously in scale since the end of the Second World War. Such capital movements are

heavily influenced by prospective returns and therefore agents' expectations about the future. As expectations

change, then so will exchange rates regardless of whether goods prices are changing. In the following chapters

we shall be looking at some of the most recent theories that attempt to take into account the implications of

such capital movements.

Nonetheless, the fact that PPP does not hold very well in the short to medium term does not mean that it

has no role to play in exchange rate determination. Overor undervaluation of currencies in relation to PPP

induce changes in current-account positions which will eventually lead to exchange rate changes. It is the case

that deviations from PPP do have a habit of reversing themselves over the longer run. Furthermore, although

exchange rates may diverge substantially from PPP, if the break in this link becomes too large the forces of

goods arbitrage do start to come into play and move the exchange rate towards its PPP value. More recent

evidence shows that PPP may be a useful guide to the long-run exchange rate and should not therefore be

abandoned altogether.

7.1 INTRODUCTION

Te PPP theory outlined in Chapter 6 is far from a satisfactory explanation of observed exchange rate behaviour.

In particular, it is very much concerned with goods arbitrage and has nothing to say about capital movements

internationally. During the post-Second World War era there has been an enormous growth of capital markets,

meaning that it is possible for international investors to switch huge amounts of money out of one currency

into another very speedily. Tis being the case, speculators will tend to move their money between currencies

based on the expected rate of return of one currency compared to another. What people expect to happen

to the exchange rate will be a crucial part in determining which currencies to buy and sell%– if a currency is

expected to depreciate, then agents will tend to switch out of that currency and into those currencies that they

expect to appreciate. In this chapter, we will look at some more recent and sophisticated exchange rate models

that have been developed in an attempt to model exchange rate behaviour more successfully.

Te common thread to the models that we will analyse in this chapter is that they all emphasize the

important role of relative money supplies in explaining the exchange rate. Te monetary models start from

the observation that the exchange rate is the price of one money in terms of another. However, the monetary

International Finance

models go beyond this simple observation to argue that exchange rate movements can be explained by changes

in the supply and demand for national money stocks. Tere are a variety of models put forward by monetarists

to explain exchange rate behaviour and we will deal with three of the most important versions in this chapter:

the 'flexible-price' monetary model, the 'sticky-price' monetary model and the 'real-interest-rate-di$erential’

model. Tese models make an assumption that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes; and there

has developed a brand of models known as portfolio balance models that allow for di$erences in riskiness

between domestic and foreign bonds. We shall spend some time looking at the implications of imperfect asset

substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds through a more general model that allows for a portfolio

balance e$etc.

7.2 UNCOVERED INTEREST RATE PARITY

Since international investors can quickly and easily switch out of domestic bonds into foreign bonds and vice

versa, the exchange rate can be viewed as a relative asset price. Te fundamental characteristic of an asset

price is that its present value will be largely influenced by its expected rate of return. Imagine the case of an

international investor who has the option of investing his or her money in euro denominated bonds or US

bonds of similar risk and maturity. If he or she regards the bonds as equally risky and can switch between

the two assets instantaneously, the only di$erence between the bonds is their currency of denomination and

possibly the interest rate attached to them. Tere will be two factors that international investors will bear in

mind when considering which to purchase: the rates of interest on eurozone bonds and US bonds, and what

they expect to happen to the dollar per euro exchange rate. We can write that:



_Es_                    - _rus_                    - _reu_ (7.1)

where _Es_ ˙ is the expected rate of depreciation of the exchange rate of the dollar, de!ned as dollars per euro, _r_ us

is the US interest rate and _r_ is the eurozone interest rate.

eu

Equation (7.1) is known as the uncovered interest parity condition (UIP). UIP states that the expected rate

- f depreciation of the dollar against the euro is equal to the interest rate di$erential between US dollar and
euro denominated bonds. For example, if the interest rate in the US is 7% per annum while the interest rate
in the eurozone is 2% per annum, then on average international investors expect the dollar to depreciate by
5% per annum.

With an initial dollar per euro exchange rate of \$1.20/€1, investing \$1,000 in US bonds will yield the

investor \$70 return (7%) at the end of the year. If he expects the dollar to depreciate by 5% during the year,

he expects the dollar–euro exchange rate to be \$1.26/€1. Hence, he could purchase \$1,000 worth of euros

today at \$1.20/€1 which gives him €833.33 and which will earn the euro interest rate of 2%, meaning he will

then have €850 which he expects to convert back into dollars at \$1.26/€1 giving him \$1,071. Tis implies an

expected return of \$71 (i.e. 7.1% or approximately 7%) from investing in euro bonds, which is approximately

equal to the expected return on US bonds. Hence, the UIP condition implies that the expected rate of return

- n domestic and foreign bonds are equal.

If the expected rate of depreciation of the dollar is 5% then according to UIP the US interest rate will have

to be 5% higher than the eurozone interest rate to ensure the equalization of expected yields on US and EU

bonds. Crucially, for the UIP condition to hold continuously requires that capital is _perfectly mobile_ so that

investors can instantly alter the composition of their international investments. In addition, they have to

150

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

regard US and EU bonds as equally risky – were this not the case then investors that are risk-averse would

require a higher expected return on the riskier asset. For example, if risk-averse US investors viewed the risk

- n EU bonds as being greater than the risk on US bonds, they would require a higher expected rate of return
- n EU bonds than US bonds so that the UIP condition no longer holds.

When there is both perfect capital mobility and equal riskiness of domestic and foreign bonds, US and EU

bonds are said to be _perfect substitutes_ . Perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign bonds implies that the

UIP condition will hold on a continuous basis. Te monetarist models that we examine in this chapter make

a crucial assumption that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes.

7.3 THE MONETARY MODELS OF EXCHANGE RATE DETERMINATION

Having provided the basic background to the monetary models of exchange rate determination we now

proceed to examine the speci!c characteristics and predictions of three of the major monetarist models of

exchange rate determination. Tese are commonly termed the 'flexible-price', 'sticky-price' and 'real-interestrate-di$erential' monetary models. A common characteristic of these models is that the supply and demand

for money are the key determinants of exchange rates.

Another common starting point is that all the models employ the UIP condition; that is, they assume that

domestic and foreign bonds are equally risky so that their expected rates of returns are equalized.

Beyond this similarity there are some signi!cant di$erences between the models. Te flexible-price

monetary model argues that all prices in the economy, be they wages, prices or exchange rates, are perfectly

flexible both upwards and downwards in both the short and the long run. It also incorporates a role for the

e$etc of inflationary expectations. Te sticky-price model, !rst elaborated by Rüdiger Dornbusch (1976a), is

a monetary model that argues that in the short run wages and prices tend to be sticky and only the exchange

rate changes in response to changes in economic policy. Only in the medium to long run do wages and

prices adjust to changes in economic policy and economic shocks. In the Dornbusch model, inflationary

expectations are not explicitly dealt with. Te real-interest-rate-di$erential model combines the role of

inflationary expectations of the flexible-price monetary model with the sticky prices of the Dornbusch model.

**Box 7.1 The UIP condition and changes in exchange rate expectations**

According to the UIP condition, changes in the future expected exchange rate can exert a signi!cant

e$ect on the spot exchange rate. In Figure 7.1 we illustrate the UIP condition for the dollar–euro

parity. Te spot exchange rate is assumed to be \$1.20/€1, the US interest rate is 7% per annum and the

euro interest rate is 2% per annum. According to the UIP condition the dollar should be expected to

depreciate by 5% per annum, that is, to $1.20 × 1.05 = $1.26/€1. In Figure 7.1(a) the expected year-end

total is \$1070 regardless of whether the money is le, in dollars or converted into €833.33 spot, which

becomes €850 and is expected to be converted back at the end of the year at €850 × $1.26/€1 = $1071.

An interesting question concerns what would happen if, for some reason, there is some bad

economic news or adverse market sentiment against the dollar that, while leaving euro and US interest

rates unchanged, leads market participants to change their view of the expected future exchange rate of

the dollar per euro parity from $1.26/€1 to, say, $1.35/€1. Te answer is shown in Figure 7.1(b). Clearly

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

7.4 THE FLEXIBLE-PRICE MONETARY MODEL

Te flexible-price monetary model was developed by Frenkel (1976), Mussa (1976) and Bilson (1978a and

1978b) and assumes that PPP holds continuously. It represents a valuable addition to exchange rate theory

because it explicitly introduces relative money stocks into the picture as determinants of the relative prices

which in turn determine the exchange rate.

We start by assuming that there is a conventional money demand function given by:

_m_            - _p_            - � _y_            - � _r_ (7.2)

where _m_ is the log of the domestic money stock, _p_ is the log of the domestic price level, _y_ is the log of domestic

real income and _r_ is the nominal domestic interest rate.

Equation (7.2) says that the demand to hold real money balances is positively related to real domestic

income, due to increased transactions demand, and inversely related to the domestic interest rate. A similar

relationship holds for the foreign money demand function which is given by:

_m_           - � _p_           -           - � _y_           -           -           - _r_           - (7.3)

where _m_ - is the log of the foreign nominal money stock, _p_ - is the log of the foreign price level, _y_ - is the log of

the foreign real income and _r_ - is the foreign interest rate.

It is assumed that PPP holds continuously, expressed as:

_s_ = _p_                                 - _p_                                 - (7.4)

where _s_ is the log of the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency.

Te monetarist models make a crucial assumption that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes.

Tis being the case, the uncovered interest parity condition holds:

_Es_                     - � _r_ _r_                    - (7.5)

where _Es_ ˙ is the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency. Equation (7.5) says that the expected rate

- f depreciation of the home currency is equal to the interest rate di$erential between domestic and foreign
bonds.

We can rearrange equations (7.2) and (7.3) to give solutions for the domestic and foreign price levels:

_p_                 - _m_                 -                 - _y_                 -                 - _r_ (7.6)

_p_                -                - _m_                -                -                - _y_                -                - � _r_                - (7.7)

We then substitute equations (7.6) and (7.7) into equation (7.4) to obtain:

_s_                 - ( _m_                 - _m_ *)                 -                 - ( _y_                 - _y_ *)                 -                 - ( _r_                 - _r_ *) (7.8)

1. **Relative money supplies affect exchange rates:** a given percentage increase in the home money

supply leads to an exactly equivalent depreciation of the currency, while a given percentage increase

in the foreign money supply leads to an exactly equivalent percentage appreciation of the domestic

currency. Te rationale behind this is that a 10% increase in the home money supply leads to an

immediate 10% increase in prices, and because PPP holds continuously this also implies a 10%

depreciation of the currency. Conversely, a 10% increase in the foreign money supply leads to a 10%

rise in foreign prices and for PPP to hold this means the domestic currency appreciates 10%.

2. **Relative levels of national income influence exchange rates:** if domestic income were to rise, this

increases the transactions demand for money, and the increased demand for money means that if

the money stock and interest rates are held constant the increased demand for real balances can only

come about through a fall in domestic prices (see equation 7.2). Te fall in domestic prices then

requires an appreciation of the currency to maintain PPP. On the other hand, an increase in foreign

income leads to a fall in the foreign price level and therefore a depreciation of the home currency to

maintain PPP.

3. an increase in the domestic interest rate leads to a
**Relative interest rates affect exchange rates:**

depreciation of the domestic currency. Te rationale behind this is that a rise in the domestic interest

rate leads to a fall in the demand for money and hence a depreciation of the domestic currency.

Another rationalization for this e$etc can be made by expressing the nominal interest rate as made up

    - f two components, the real interest rate and the expected inflation rate; that is:

_r_ = _i_ + _Pe_ ˙

where _i_ is the real rate of interest and _Pė_

is the expected rate of price inflation. Similarly the foreign

nominal interest rate is given by:

_r* = i* + Pė*_

Assuming that the real rate of interest is constant and identical in both countries ( _i_ = _i_ *), an increase in

the domestic nominal interest rate is due to an increase in domestic price inflation expectations. Such

increased inflation expectations lead to a decreased demand for money and an increased expenditure

    - n goods, which in turn leads to a rise in domestic prices. Te rise in domestic prices then requires a

depreciation of the currency to maintain PPP. Conversely, an expected rise in the foreign prices leads

to a fall in the demand for the foreign currency and therefore an appreciation of the domestic currency

to maintain PPP.

Equation (7.8) can be rewritten using price inflation expectations di$erentials instead of interest rate

di$erentials as:

_s_                        - ( _m_                        - _m_ *)                        -                        - ( _y_                        - _y_ *)                        -                        - ( _Pe_                         - _Pe_  *) (7.9)

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Te flexible price monetary model is based upon the premise that all prices in an economy are fully flexible,

that bonds are perfect substitutes and what matters for exchange rate determination is the demand for money

in relation to the supply of money. In such circumstances, countries with high monetary growth rates will

have high inflationary expectations which leads to a reduction in the demand to hold real money balances, an

increased expenditure on goods, a rise in the domestic price level and a depreciation of the currency in order

to maintain PPP. Tere have been many tests of the monetarist models but, given that the theory is based upon

PPP, it is not surprising that it has not performed well empirically (empirical tests of this and other exchange

rate models are dealt with in Chapter 9).

Despite its shortcomings and reliance on PPP, the flexible-price monetarist model is an important addition

to exchange rate theory because it introduces the role of money supplies, inflationary expectations and

economic growth as determinants of exchange rate changes.

**Box 7.2 The carry trade does not make sense according to UIP**

In a carry trade investors borrow money in a low interest rate currency and place it into a higher interest

rate currency in the hope that the latter will either appreciate or not depreciate more than the interest

rate di$erential, enabling an excess return to be made. Te carry trade has been increasingly used in

recent years by hedge funds, speculators and banks despite the fact that UIP theory suggests that it will

not produce excess returns in the long run. Remember, the UIP condition predicts that over the long

run the low interest rate currency will on average appreciate by the interest rate di$erential so as to make

the carry trade a break-even strategy. Nonetheless, if UIP does not hold then the carry trade might work

in the short run or even for several years (just as it can also fail at both time horizons). Te carry trade

will prove unpro!table if the currency with the high interest rate depreciates by an amount greater than

the interest rate di$erential over the relevant time horizon.

A simple example of the carry trade will suffice. Imagine the yen/euro rate is 100 yen per euro and

the Japanese interest rate is 1% and the euro interest rate is 5%. A hedge fund might decide to borrow

10 million yen for one year knowing it will have to pay back 10,100,000 yen in a year's time. Te hedge

fund then sells the yen in the spot market to gain €100,000 which will earn 5% in euros and so become

€105,000. So long as the euro has not depreciated to below 96.19 yen/€1 then the carry trade will be

pro!table. For example, if the euro actually appreciates to 110 yen/€1 then the hedge fund will make

1,450,000 yen pro!t (or €13,181.82). Even if the exchange rate remains at 100 yen/€1 the hedge fund will

be able to convert the €105,000 and obtain 10,500,000 yen and so make a 400,000 yen pro!t (or €4,000).

Te carry trade strategy will break even if the euro depreciates approximately 4% to 96.19 yen/€1 when

€105,000 converts to 10,100,000 yen, which is just sufficient to repay the borrowed 10,000,000 yen

plus 100,000 yen interest. However, there are risks with the carry trade. Te real danger is if the yen

appreciates by substantially more than 4%. Say the yen were to appreciate sharply to 80 yen per euro by

the end of the year. In this case the €105,000 will be worth 8,400,000 yen leaving the hedge fund with a

shortfall (loss) of 1,700,000 yen of the required 10,100,000 yen that it needs to repay, which is the euro

equivalent loss of €21,250. Te various scenarios are depicted in Figure 7.2.

According to UIP on average we can expect the Japanese yen to appreciate to 96.19 so that the

expected pro!t from the carry trade is zero. Te carry trade therefore implies that markets on average

lead to a depreciation of the high interest rate currency less than would be predicted by the interest

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

7.5 THE DORNBUSCH STICKY-PRICE MONETARIST MODEL.

One of the major de!ciencies of the flexible-price monetarist model is that it assumes that PPP holds

continuously and that prices are as flexible upwards and downwards as exchange rates. Indeed, it is price

changes that are supposed to induce exchange rate changes via the PPP condition. As such, the model is of no

use in explaining the observed prolonged departures from PPP since floating exchange rates were adopted. In

a classic article, Dornbusch (1976a) proposed a monetary exchange rate model that could explain large and

prolonged departures of the exchange rate from PPP.

Te model outlined by Dornbusch is termed the sticky-price monetarist model and introduces the concept

- f exchange rate 'overshooting'. Te basis underlying the model is that prices in the goods market and wages in
the labour market are determined in sticky-price markets and only tend to change slowly over time in response
to various shocks such as changes in the money supply. Prices and wages are especially resistant to downward
pressure. However, the exchange rate is determined in a 'flex-price' market and can immediately appreciate or
depreciate in response to new developments and shocks. In such circumstances, exchange rate changes are not
matched by corresponding price movements and there can be persistent and prolonged departures from PPP.

As the Dornbusch overshooting model represents such an important contribution to exchange rate theory

and understanding exchange rate behaviour, we shall !rst consider a simple explanation of the model without

recourse to the use of mathematics to grasp the essential ideas. Only then shall we proceed to a more formal

presentation of the model.

7.6 A SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE DORNBUSCH MODEL

In the Dornbusch model the UIP condition is assumed to hold continuously; that is, if the domestic interest

rate is lower than the foreign interest rate then there needs to be an equivalent expected rate of appreciation

- f the domestic currency to compensate for the lower domestic interest rate. Tis is because there is perfect
arbitrage of expected returns in capital markets. By contrast, goods prices adjust only slowly over time to
changes in economic policy partly because wages are only adjusted periodically and partly because !rms are
slow to adjust their prices upwards or downwards – so we have 'sticky' domestic prices.

In such an environment, imagine that everyone believes that the long-run exchange rate is determined by

PPP. Also, that the economy is initially in full equilibrium with a domestic interest rate _r_ 1 equal to the world

interest rate, so that there is no expected appreciation or depreciation of the currency. Such a situation is

illustrated in Figure 7.4. Te domestic money stock is given by _M_ 1 which gives a domestic price level of _P_ 1 and

an exchange rate _S_ 1 which, given the foreign price level, corresponds to PPP. Let us now suppose that at time

_t_ 1 the authorities unexpectedly expand the domestic money supply by 20% from _M_ 1 to _M_ 2.

In the long run everyone knows that a 20% rise in the domestic money supply will lead to a 20% rise

in domestic prices from _P_ 1 to _P_ and therefore a 20% depreciation of the domestic currency from _S_ 1 to _S_

to maintain long-run PPP. However, in the short run the Dornbusch model shows that things will be very

di$erent: because domestic prices are sticky they remain at _P_ 1. Te unexpected increase in the domestic

money supply will mean that at price level _P_ 1 there is now an excess supply of money that will only willingly

be held if the domestic interest rate falls from _r_ to _r_ . As the domestic interest rate will then be lower than the

1 2

world interest rate, this means that speculators will require an expected appreciation of the domestic currency

to compensate. For this reason, the domestic currency jump depreciates at time _t_ 1 from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2, overshooting

its long-run equilibrium value _S_ . Te exchange rate has to 'overshoot' its long-run equilibrium value because it

_t_ 1

**Figure 7.4** Te dynamics of the Dornbusch overshooting model

is only by depreciating by more than 20% that there can be an expected appreciation of the domestic currency

to compensate for the lower rate of interest on domestic bonds.

A,er the initial response of the exchange rate and interest rate to the increase in the money stock, there are

a number of forces that come into play to move the economy to its long-run equilibrium. As a result of the fall

in the domestic interest rate and the depreciation of the domestic currency, there is an increase in the demand

for domestic goods. As output is assumed to be !xed, this excess demand for domestic goods starts to drive

up domestic prices from _P_ 1. Te increased demand for domestic goods by foreigners leads to an exchange rate

appreciation from _S_ 2 to _S_ (thus the expected appreciation is matched by an actual appreciation). At the same

time, the rise in the domestic price level leads to an increase in domestic money demand and a rise in the

domestic interest rate to maintain money-market equilibrium. Over time the domestic price level rises from

_P_ 1 to _P_ by the same percentage as the increase in the money supply; the exchange rate appreciates from _S_ 2 to

_S_ which corresponds to a restoration of PPP. Meanwhile, the domestic interest rate rises from _r_ 2 to its original

level _r_ 1, so that once again there is neither an expected appreciation nor depreciation of the domestic currency.

Having outlined the principal idea we now proceed to a more formal exposition of the Dornbusch model

- f exchange rate overshooting. Tose readers who wish to skip this can proceed straight to section 7.12.

7.7 A FORMAL EXPLANATION OF THE DORNBUSCH MODEL

In the model outlined, we focus upon a 'small country' in the sense that it faces a !xed world interest rate _r_ which it cannot influence. Te demand to hold money in the home country is given by a conventional money

demand function:

_m_            - _p_            -            - _y_            - � _r_ (7.10)

158

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

where _m_ is the log of the domestic money stock, _p_ is the log of the domestic price level, _y_ is the log of domestic

real income and _r_ is the nominal domestic interest rate.

We again assume that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes so that the UIP condition holds,

that is:

_Es_                     - � _r_ _r_                    - (7.11)

where _Es_ ˙ is the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency.

Te major di$erence between the sticky-price and flexible-price monetary models is that the stickyprice model assumes that PPP holds only in the long run, not continuously as assumed in the flexible-price

monetary model. Te hypothesis that the long-run exchange rate is determined by PPP yields:

_s_                          - _p_                          - _p_                          - (7.12)

where ~~_s_~~ is the log of the long-run equilibrium exchange rate, ~~_p_~~ is the log of the long-run domestic price level

and ~~_p_~~ - is the log of the long-run foreign price level.

Since the model allows for departures from PPP, it is necessary to specify an equation for the expected rate

- f change of the exchange rate. Te Dornbusch model speci!es a regressive exchange given by:



_Es_                 -                 - ( ~~_s_~~                 - _s_ ) where                 -                 - 0 (7.13)

Equation (7.13) states that the expected rate of depreciation of a currency is determined by the speed of

adjustment parameter 1 and the gap between the current exchange rate _s_ and its long-run equilibrium value

~~_s_~~ . If the spot rate is above ~~_s_~~, then the exchange rate of the domestic currency will be expected to appreciate

(that is, _Es_ ˙ is negative), whereas if the spot rate _s_ is below ~~_s_~~ then the exchange rate of the domestic currency is

expected to depreciate (that is, _Es_ ˙ is positive).

We now proceed to derive the two schedules vital to the Dornbusch model: the goods-market equilibrium

schedule, which shows equality of aggregate demand and supply for goods, and the money-market equilibrium

schedule, which shows equality between the demand and supply of money.

7.8 DERIVATION OF THE GOODS-MARKET EQUILIBRIUM SCHEDULE

Te goods-market equilibrium (GG) schedule shows the equality of demand and supply for goods in the price

level–exchange rate plane. Te model postulates that the rate of price inflation in the model is determined by

the gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Tat is:



_p_                   -                   - ( _d_                   - _y_ ) (7.14)

where _p˙_ is the rate of domestic price inflation, _π_ is the speed of adjustment of prices and _d_ is the log of

aggregate demand and _y_ the log of real income.

Aggregate demand is assumed to be a function of exogenous expenditure *, a positive function of the real

exchange rate expressed in log form as ( _s_ - _p_ + _p_ *), a positive function of domestic income and a negative

function of the domestic nominal interest rate, which yields:

159

International Finance

_d_              -              -              -              - ( _s_              - _p_              - _p_ )*              -              - _y_              -              - _r_ (7.15)

Substituting equation (7.15) into equation (7.14) we obtain:



_p_             -             - �[             -             - ( _s_             - _p_             - _p_ *)             - (�             - 1) _y_             -             - _r_ ] (7.16)

Along the GG schedule the equality of supply and demand for goods means that there is zero inflation, that

is, _p˙_ = 0. To !nd the slope of the GG schedule we must substitute a solution for _r_ from equation (7.10) into

equation (7.16) to obtain:

.

_p_          -          - �[          -          - ( _s_          - _p_          - _p_ *)          - (�          - 1)y�          - �/ (p m�          -          - _y_ ) (7.17)

Ten by setting equation (7.17) to zero we !nd the slope of the GG schedule in the price level–exchange rate

plane. Along the GG schedule aggregate demand equals aggregate supply, implying zero price inflation. Te

slope of the GG schedule is given by:

dp - 

ds p 0  - - ���/

(7.18)

From equation (7.18) we can see that the GG schedule is upward-sloping from le, to right and has a slope of

less than unity, as shown in Figure 7.5.

Te rationale behind the GG schedule is that a depreciation (rise) of the exchange rate leads to an

increased demand for exports, which can only be o$set by a rise in the domestic price level which negates

the competitive advantage of the depreciation. However, because the rise in the price level increases money

demand, it is accompanied by a rise in interest rates which further reduces demand. Tis means that the

160

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

percentage depreciation of the exchange rate has to exceed the percentage rise in the price level to keep

aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply.

To the le, of the GG schedule in Figure 7.5 there is an excess supply of goods due to the fact that, assuming

- output to be !xed for any given price level, an exchange rate appreciation (fall) reduces aggregate demand.
Te excess supply of goods will put downward pressure on prices. Conversely, to the right of the GG schedule,
for any given price level, the exchange rate depreciation (rise) leads to an excess demand for domestic goods
causing an upward pressure on prices.

7.9 DERIVATION OF THE MONEY-MARKET EQUILIBRIUM SCHEDULE

Te money-market (MM) schedule shows di$erent combinations of the price level and exchange rate that are

consistent with equilibrium in the money market; that is, equilibrium of the supply and demand for money. To

derive the money-market schedule we !rst of all invert the money demand function (equation 7.10) to solve

the domestic interest rate, which yields:

_r_ - _p_ - _m_ - - _y_

(7.19)

We then substitute the solution for _Es_ ˙ in equation (7.11) into equation (7.13) and replace the solution for _r_ in

equation (7.19) to obtain:

1

_s_                   - _s_                   - _p_                   - _m_                   -                   - _y_                   -                   - _r_ *] (7.20)

          - � [[]

which means that the slope of the money-market schedule is given by:

d

d

_p_ (7.21)

_s_ [����]

_p_

Hence the MM schedule is shown to have a negative slope in the price level–exchange rate plane as shown in

Figure 7.6.

For a given money stock a fall in the price level implies a relatively high real money stock, and

high real money balances will only be willingly held if the domestic interest rate falls, which requires

an expected appreciation of the currency to compensate holders of the domestic currency. Given that

exchange rate expectations are regressive, such an expected appreciation can only occur if the exchange

rate depreciates.

Equilibrium of the model occurs when both the goods and money markets are in equilibrium and the

exchange rate is at its PPP value as shown in Figure 7.7.

Te PPP line is depicted as a ray from the origin indicating that if the domestic price level increases by _x_ %

then the exchange rate must also depreciate by _x_ % to maintain PPP. Te GG schedule as we have seen is less

steep than the PPP line because an _x_ % rise in the price level needs to be accompanied by a greater than _x_ %

depreciation of the exchange rate. Te money-market schedule is given by MM, and it is assumed that the

money market is in continuous equilibrium so that the economy is always somewhere on the MM schedule.

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Te economy is in full equilibrium when the exchange rate corresponds to PPP, aggregate supply equals

aggregate demand and there is asset-market equilibrium – this occurs where all three schedules intersect

at point A. We are now in a position to consider the e$ects of an economic shock such as an increase in the

domestic money supply in the Dornbusch model.

7.10 A MONEY SUPPLY EXPANSION AND EXCHANGE RATE 'OVERSHOOTING'

Te e$ects of an _x_ % increase in the money supply in the context of the Dornbusch model are illustrated in

Figure 7.8.

Initially the economy is in full equilibrium at point A where the G1G1 schedule intersects the M1M1 schedule.

Let us now suppose that the authorities unexpectedly expand the money supply by _x_ %. Before examining the

short-run e$ects of the money expansion it is worth considering what will be the long-run e$ects. In the long

run, we know that domestic prices will rise by the same percentage as the rise in the money stock, which gives

a long-run price of _P_ which is _x_ % above _p_ 1. As PPP holds in the long run, a rise in the domestic price level of

_x_ % requires a depreciation of the exchange rate by _x_ %, which gives a long-run exchange rate. Bearing this in

mind we can now consider the short-run e$ects of the monetary expansion.

In the short run, the _x_ % increase in the money supply results in a rightward shi, of the M1M1 schedule to

M2M2. We know that the M2M2 schedule must pass through the long-run equilibrium price _P_ and long-run

exchange rate _S_ at point C. Te major feature of the Dornbusch model is that, in the short run, domestic prices

are sticky, while money markets are in continuous equilibrium, as indicated by the UIP condition. In the

context of Figure 7.8 this means that the economy is always on the new money-market equilibrium schedule

M2M2. As domestic prices do not initially change, the price level remains at _p_ 1 and this is consistent with a

jump in the exchange rate from S1 to S2 on the money-market equilibrium schedule M2M2. Te fact that the

short-run equilibrium exchange rate S2 exceeds the long-run equilibrium rate _S_ is known as exchange rate

'overshooting'.

Te reason why in the short run the exchange rate overshoots its long-run equilibrium value is as follows.

Given that domestic prices are !xed in the short run, the money supply expansion creates an excess of real

money balances which (given a !xed output level) are only willingly held at a lower domestic interest rate.

According to the UIP condition, a fall in the domestic interest rate means that international investors will

require an expected appreciation of the domestic currency to compensate for the lower domestic interest rate.

An expected appreciation of the domestic currency is only possible if the exchange rate depreciation in the

short run exceeds the required long-run depreciation. Tis is shown in Figure 7.8 by the fact that the exchange

rate jump depreciates from S1 to S2, overshooting the long-run equilibrium exchange rate _S_ . Te exchange rate

is then expected to appreciate from S2 to _S_ .

Having had a short-run jump in the exchange rate to point B on the M2M2 schedule, forces come into play

to move the economy along the M2M2 schedule over time from point B to the long-run point C. Tere are two

factors at work in the movement from B to C during which time the currency appreciates from S2 to its longrun equilibrium value _S_ and the price level rises from _P_ 1 to its long-run value _P_ . First, the reduced domestic

interest rate will encourage increased expenditure. Second, the undervaluation of the currency in relation to

its PPP value will mean that domestic goods become relatively cheap as compared to foreign goods, and this

leads to a substitution of world demand in favour of domestic goods which Dornbusch (1976b) identi!es as

the 'arbitrage e$ect'. Tese two factors work to shi, up the goods market expenditure schedule from G1G1 to

G2G2 and drive up the domestic price level and appreciate the exchange rate until the long-run equilibrium is

established at point C. During the transition, the rise in the price level reduces real money balances, requiring

a rise in the domestic interest rate until at _P_ the original interest rate is restored and there is no expected

change in the exchange rate.

7.11 IMPORTANCE OF THE STICKY-PRICE MONETARY MODEL

Te sticky-price monetary model represented a major advance in the exchange rate literature, and it has had

lasting appeal. Te major innovation of the model is its emphasis on capital-market rather than goods-market

arbitrage as being the major determinant of exchange rates in the short run. Goods-market arbitrage is viewed

as relevant to exchange rate determination only in the medium to long run, while the desire of investors to

equalize expected yields on their international portfolios is viewed as the major determinant of the short-run

exchange rate.

Te model provides an intuitively appealing explanation of why exchange rate movements have been large

relative to movements in international prices and changes in international money stocks. Furthermore, it

explains such movements as the outcome of a rational foreign exchange market that produces an exchange

rate that deviates from PPP according to economic fundamentals and not in isolation from them. Most

economists !nd it hard to accept the notion that observed divergences of exchange rates from PPP have been

due to irrational speculation. Te existence of models such as Dornbusch's that explain such deviations as the

result of rational speculation provide considerable comfort.

164

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Another important point that comes from the Dornbusch model is that it helps explain why observed

exchange rates are usually even more volatile than supposed determinants such as the money supply.

Since the exchange rate initially depreciates by more than _x_ % in the short run in response to an _x_ %

increase in the money supply, it follows that the exchange rate will be more volatile than domestic

monetary policy.

7.12 THE FRANKEL REAL-INTEREST-RATE-DIFFERENTIAL MODEL

Te sticky-price monetary model of Dornbusch represents a major advance on the flexible-price monetary

exchange rate model; but, unlike the latter, the Dornbusch model does not explicitly take into account

inflationary expectations. However, the 1970s period of floating exchange rates was dominated by inflation.

In a bid to combine the inflationary expectations element of the flexible-price monetary model with the

insights of the sticky-price model, Frankel (1979) developed a general monetary exchange rate model that

accommodates the 'flexible-price' and 'sticky-price' monetarist models as special cases.

As in the other monetarist models, there is a conventional money demand function:

_m_           - _p_           - � _y_           - � _r_ (7.22)

where _m_ is the log of the domestic money stock, _p_ is the log of the domestic price level, _y_ is the log of domestic

real income and _r_ is the nominal domestic interest rate.

Similar relationships are postulated for the rest of the world as represented by the foreign country:

_m_          -          - _p_          -          -          - _y_          -          - � _r_          - (7.23)

where an asterisk represents a foreign variable.

For simplicity it is also assumed that elasticities (( and 2) are identical across countries. Combining

equations (7.22) and (7.23) yields:

( _m_                  - _m_ *)                  - ( _p_                  - _p_ *)                  -                  - ( _y_                  - _y_ *)                  - �( _r_                  - _r_ *) (7.24)

Like the other monetarist models the theory assumes that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes

so that the UIP condition holds:

_Es_                      - � _r_ _r_                     - (7.25)

where _Es_ ˙ is the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency.

As in the Dornbusch model, it is assumed that the expected rate of depreciation of the exchange rate is a

positive function of the gap between the spot rate _S_ and the long-run equilibrium rate _S_ . In addition it is also

a function of the expected long-run inflation di$erential between the domestic and foreign economies. Tis

yields:

  

_Es_                   -                   - ( ~~_s_~~                   - _s_ )                   - _Pe_                   - _Pe_                   - (7.26)

International Finance

where 1 is the speed of adjustment to equilibrium, _Pe˙_ is the expected long-run domestic inflation rate and _Pe˙_ is the expected long-run foreign inflation rate. Equation (7.26) states that, in the short run, the spot exchange

rate as given by _s_ is expected to return to its long-run equilibrium value _S_ at a rate 1. In the long run, since

s = ~~_s_~~ the expected rate of depreciation of the currency is equal to the di$erence of the domestic to foreign

inflation via the relative PPP condition.

Combining equations (7.25) and (7.26) yields:

1  

_s_                      - _s_                      - �                      - � _r_                      - _Pe_ )                      - ( * _r_                      - _Pe_ *)�� (7.27)

            - [(]

Equation (7.27) states that the gap between the current real exchange rate and its long-run equilibrium value

is proportional to the real interest rate di$erential as given by the term in brackets. Tus, if the real rate of

interest on domestic bonds is greater than the real rate of interest on foreign bonds, there will be a depreciation

- f the domestic currency until the real interest rates are equalized in the long-run steady state.

By invoking long-run PPP, the long-run equilibrium exchange rate ~~_s_~~ can be expressed in log form as the

di$erence between the long-run price levels:

_s_                            - _p_                            - _p_                            - (7.28)

In the long run the expected real rates of interest are equalized so that any long-run nominal interest rate

di$erentials are explained by di$erences in the steady-state inflation rates:

_r_                       - _r_                       -                       - _Pe_                        - _Pe_                        - (7.29)

By combining equations (7.29) and (7.28) with equation (7.24) we can obtain an expression for the long-run

steady-state equilibrium exchange rate given by:

 

~~_s_~~                   - ( _m_                   - _m_ *)                   -                   - ( _y_                   - _y_ *)                   -                   - ( _Pe_                   - _Pe_ *) (7.30)

Equation (7.30) states that the long-run equilibrium exchange rate is determined by the relative supply

( _m_ - _m_ *) and relative demands as given by ( ( _y_ - _y_ *) + 2 ( _Pe˙−Pe_ ˙*) of the two national money stocks. Te

reader will note that equation (7.30), which refers to the long-run exchange rate, is identical to equation (7.9)

- f the flexible-price monetarist model for the short-run exchange rate. However, the solution for the shortrun exchange rate in the Frankel model di$ers because of sticky prices in the short run. We will now proceed
to !nd the solution for the short-run exchange rate in the Frankel model.

In the Frankel generalization of the Dornbusch model, the speed of adjustment of the goods market is

relevant to the determination of the short-run exchange rate, so that equation (7.27) has to be taken into

account when solving the short-run exchange rate. Combining equation (7.30) with (7.27) and rearranging

terms yields the following solution for the short-run exchange rate:

_s_           - ( _m_           - _m_ *)           -           - ( _y_           - _y_ *)           -           - ( _Pe_            - _Pe_  *)           - 1           - �( _r_           - _Pe_  )           - ( * _r_           - _Pe_  *)�� (7.31)

166

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Te Frankel formulation makes clear that if there is a disequilibrium set of real interest rates, then the exchange

rate will deviate from its long-run equilibrium value. If the real domestic interest rate is below the real foreign

interest rate then the exchange rate of the domestic currency will be undervalued in relation to its long-run

equilibrium value, so that there is an expected appreciation of the real exchange rate of the domestic currency

to compensate.

Te fully flexible price monetarist school argues that all markets clear instantaneously so that the speed

- f adjustment parameter 1 in equation (7.31) is in!nite, so that the solution for the short-run exchange
rate is given by equation (7.9). In the real interest model as portrayed by equation (7.31), the goods and
labour market prices are assumed to be slow to adjust to shocks so the speed of adjustment parameter 1 is
!nite. Tus, rational expectations hold for the foreign exchange market but not for domestic markets. In such
circumstances, an unanticipated monetary expansion leads to a fall in the real domestic interest rate relative
to the real foreign interest rate, while the domestic price level is initially unchanged but expected to rise. Te
result according to equation (7.31) is that the short-run exchange rate overshoots its long-run equilibrium
value, depreciating proportionately more than the increase in the money stock so that there are expectations

- f a future appreciation of the currency to compensate for the lower real rate of return on domestic bonds.

7.13 IMPLICATIONS OF THE MONETARY VIEWS OF EXCHANGE RATE DETERMINATION

Whichever monetarist model one adopts, a clear implication is that monetary policy is the only predictable

and e$ective means of influencing the exchange rate. Furthermore, because domestic and foreign bonds are

assumed to be perfect substitutes there is no distinction to be made between the e$ects of an open market

- peration (OMO) and a foreign exchange market operation (FXO). An expansionary OMO is a purchase of
domestic Treasury bonds, while an expansionary FXO is a purchase of foreign bonds. As far as the monetary
model is concerned, if they increase the money supply by a like amount they have identical exchange rate
e$ects. What matters for the exchange rate is the supply of money in relation to the demand for it – the source

- f creation of the money stock is irrelevant.

From the above, it follows that there is no scope for the authorities to pursue a sterilized foreign exchange

- peration (SFXO) that will have exchange rate e$ects. An SFXO is an exchange of domestic for foreign bonds
that leaves the supply of money in relation to the demand for it una$ected. Within the context of the monetary
approach to exchange rate determination, because the two assets are perfect substitutes and the money supply
is le, unchanged, an SFXO cannot exert exchange rate e$ects.

In the flexible-price monetarist model, while the authorities can influence the nominal exchange in a

predictable fashion by monetary policy, they cannot do so with the real exchange rate. If there is a once

and for all _x_ % increase in the money supply this will lead to a once and for all _x_ % depreciation of the home

currency and a simultaneous _x_ % increase in both the domestic price level and wages. Tis is a case of complete

neutrality of monetary policy with respect to the real economy; monetary policy influences only nominal not

real variables.

Within the context of the sticky-price monetarist approach, the authorities can exploit the !nite speed of

adjustment of domestic markets to influence the real exchange rate in the short run, provided that real output

is !xed. For example, if there is an unexpected increase in the domestic money stock, we have seen that with

domestic prices that are sticky in the short run there will be a depreciation of the real exchange rate. Te

Frankel model makes clear that the overshooting of the exchange rate is proportional to the deviation of the

real domestic interest rate from its equilibrium value.

167

International Finance

Te possibility of real exchange rate overshooting due to the adoption of an expansionary or contractionary

monetary policy has strengthened the arguments of those that call for 'gradualism' in the implementation of

monetary policy. Te basis of their claim is that economic agents in the goods and labour markets take time

to adjust to a new monetary policy regime because they need convincing that the authorities mean what they

say. For this reason, domestic wage restraint is unlikely to follow immediately upon the adoption of a tighter

monetary policy. If this is the case, then the real exchange rate will appreciate in the short run and thereby

place pressure on the tradables sector of the economy. Gradualists argue that if the authorities implement

their policy of restraint gradually, then economic agents will have time to observe that the authorities are

implementing their stated policy and that wage behaviour will then adjust without the high cost imposed

upon the economy of overshooting.

Whichever monetarist view one adheres to, the clear implication is that monetary policy is the most e$ective

means of managing the exchange rate. Furthermore, in the long run the authorities should abandon any

attempt to influence the real exchange rate because it is determined by real and not monetary factors. Tus, in

the long run (short run in the flexible-price version) the authorities should direct exchange rate management

at stabilizing the domestic price level. Whether stabilizing the domestic price level will stabilize the nominal

exchange rate depends upon the stability of the foreign price level and therefore upon the monetary policies of

foreign countries. Te authorities should not seek to stabilize the nominal exchange rate by monetary policy

because this may involve destabilizing the domestic price level if the foreign authorities are not pursuing

stable monetary policies.

**Box 7.3 Is the new open economy macroeconomics a challenge to the**
**Mundell–Fleming and Dornbusch overshooting models?**

Obstfeld and Rogo$ (1995) started what has become known as the literature on new open economy

macroeconomics (NOEM); other contributions in this area include Chari et al. (2002), Lane (2001),

Corseti and Pesenti (2001) and Sarno (2001), and an excellent exposition of many issues is contained

in Mark (2001, ch. 9). While this literature is technically quite advanced, it is important to understand

how it di$ers from the Mundell–Fleming and Dornbusch overshooting models. Te new open

economy macroeconomics is based on microeconomic foundations and is intertemporal in nature.

A representative consumer maximizes their utility over their (in!nite!) lifetime; this utility depends

positively upon current and future consumption, positively upon their real money balances, and

negatively on work e$ort (and since work e$ort is positively related to output, then utility is negatively

related to output). Te model assumes that both PPP and UIP hold at all times, that goods produced at

home and abroad are di$erentiated (a market structure based on monopolistic competition) and, since

producers have monopolistic price setting powers, there is a suboptimal level of real output. Economic

agents are assumed to be interested in smoothing their consumption over time in both the home and

foreign economies, and their interactions are explicitly modelled and money demand is positively

related to consumption rather than to income.

Te main focus of the Obstfeld and Rogo$ (1995) _Redux_ paper is on analysing the impacts of a

monetary shock. They show that, when good prices are perfectly flexible, a permanent increase in the

money supply produces no dynamics and that prices increase in exact proportion to the increase in the

money supply and the exchange rate depreciates by a like amount, so monetary policy has no role in

correcting the suboptimal level of output. If, however, one allows for price stickiness in the goods markets

168

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

in the short run, then things are very di$erent: an increase in the money supply will lead to a fall in the

domestic interest rate and a depreciation of the currency, which makes domestic goods cheaper relative

to foreign goods and leads to an increase in domestic output since increases in demand will encourage

monopolistic producers to raise output, even with !xed short-run domestic prices. Although output rises,

consumption rises by less; and since consumers wish to smooth consumption over time they save part of

the increase in output, hence the current account moves into surplus, which then raises domestic wealth

due to an accumulation of foreign assets which over time reduces their work e$ort. In the long run, the

level of domestic output is permanently higher than before the monetary expansion (though lower than

the initial level of output induced by the monetary shock), so money is non-neutral in the long run.

In the short run, while the exchange rate depreciates, it does not overshoot, as in the Dornbusch

model, because the foreign interest rate also declines following the home monetary expansion, the lower

interest rate and the improved terms of trade raise consumption in the foreign economy. It is not clear

what happens to foreign output because, while the increase in foreign consumption will tend to raise

its output, the appreciation of its currency will tend to work in the opposite direction. In any case, the

increase in foreign consumption is greater than any output rise (or fall) resulting in a current account

de!cit for the foreign economy.

A remarkable result of the Obstfeld and Rogo$ paper is that the monetary expansion raises domestic

and foreign welfare by equal amounts despite the di$ering output e$ects on the two economies. Tis

is because the fall in interest rate generates equivalent increases in consumption in both the domestic

and foreign economies. Tere is an improvement in world welfare as global output rises following the

monetary shock. Tere is one big problem with the new open economy models, however, which is that

they are extremely sensitive to the particular model speci!cation. For example, Corseti and Pesenti

(2001) show that under a di$erent model speci!cation a monetary shock does not lead to a current

account surplus (in fact, it stays in balance) and the long-run output e$ects of a monetary expansion are

neutral. Obstfeld and Rogo$ did not allow for the presence of physical capital, but Chari et al. (1998)

argue that it is essential to allow for capital since a monetary expansion by lowering the domestic interest

rate may lead to an investment boom and a short-run current account de!cit rather than the surplus

in Obstfeld and Rogo$. Lane (2001) shows that, for a small open economy exchange rate, overshooting

still occurs since the fall in the domestic interest rate does not lead to a fall in the interest rate in the

large economy. Similarly, as outlined in Mark (2001), if !rms price to market then it is also possible to

get exchange rate overshooting in the Obstfeld and Rogo$ model.

Tere is no doubt that the new open economy macroeconomics o$ers some new and important

insights, particularly the emphasis on the microfoundations and importance of market structure. As

Lane (2001, p. 236) points out:

Tis approach o$ers several attractions. Te presentation of explicit utility and pro!t maximisation

problems provides welcome clarity and analytical rigour. Moreover, it allows the researcher to

conduct welfare analysis, thereby laying the groundwork for credible policy evaluation. Allowing

nominal rigidities and market imperfections alters the transmission mechanism for shocks and

also provides a more potent role for monetary policy. In this way, by addressing issues of concern

to policymakers, one goal of this new strand of research is to provide an analytical framework that

is relevant for policy analysis and o$ers a superior alternative to the Mundell–Fleming model that

is still widely employed in policy circles as the theoretical reference point.

169

International Finance

Although the new open economy models are rigorous and allow for rich dynamics, the outcome of

the models can prove very sensitive to, _inter alia_ : the speci!cation of the utility function; elasticities

between current and future consumption, and between domestic and foreign goods; whether price

stickiness originates from the labour or goods markets; the type of market structure assumed; whether

the economy is small or large; the size of the monetary shocks; and whether allowance is made for

traded and non-traded goods. As Sarno and Taylor (2002, p. 165) put it:

Agreeing on a particular new open economy model is hardly possible at this stage. Tis is the case

not least because it requires agreeing on assumptions which are o,en difficult to test empirically

(such as the speci!cation of the utility function) or because they concern issues about which many

economists have strong beliefs on which they are not willing to compromise (such as whether

nominal rigidities originate from the goods market or the labour market or whether nominal

rigidities exist at all) … While the profession shows some convergence towards a _consensus approach_

in macroeconomic modelling (where the need for micro foundations, for example, seems widely

accepted), it seems very unlikely that a _consensus model_ will emerge in the foreseeable future.

Hence, because of their diverse predictions and sensitivity of their results to parameter values and

particular model speci!cations, the results of the new open economy macromodels must be treated

with extreme caution when it comes to making policy recommendations. Te modern approach is,

nonetheless, clearly a major threat to the established Mundell–Fleming paradigm that has dominated

international macroeconomic thinking and modelling since the early 1960s.

7.14 ALLOWING FOR IMPERFECT SUBSTITUTABILITY BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN

BONDS

Te monetary models of exchange rate determination we have so far examined make the crucial assumption

that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes. Tis implies that the expected yields on domestic

and foreign bonds are equalized via the UIP condition. In e$ect, apart from their currency of denomination,

domestic and foreign bonds are regarded by international investors as the same. In this section, we will

examine the portfolio balance e$etc which breaks up the UIP condition by introducing a risk premium. Te

portfolio balance model distinguishes itself from the monetary models because it allows for the possibility

that international investors may regard domestic and foreign bonds as having di$erent characteristics other

than their currency of denomination in particular; they might for various reasons regard one of the bonds as

being more risky than the other. Tis being the case they will generally require a higher expected return on

the bond that is considered more risky to compensate for the additional risk it entails. For a risk premium to

exist, all of the following three conditions must be ful!lled (see Isard, 1983):

1. Tere must be perceived di$erences in risks between domestic and foreign bonds – the essence of a

risky asset being that its expected real rate of return is uncertain. Either domestic bonds are viewed

as relatively risky compared to foreign bonds, or vice versa. If the two bonds were equally risky then,

with perfect capital mobility, they must be perfect substitutes.

2. Tere has to be risk-aversion on the part of economic agents to the perceived di$erences in risk. Te

principle of risk-aversion is that investors will only be prepared to take on increased risk if there is a

170

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

sufficient increase in expected real returns to compensate. If investors were not risk-averse then they

would not expect a higher return on relatively risky bonds.

3. Given the di$erent risks on domestic and foreign bonds there is a theoretical portfolio known as the

risk-minimizing portfolio which would minimize the risks facing private agents. Tere must be a

di$erence between the risk-minimizing portfolio and the actual portfolio, forced at market clearing

prices into investors' portfolios. However, the amount of domestic and foreign bonds held by private

agents is determined by the respective authorities that issue them. If the risk-minimizing portfolio is

not held, then agents will demand a risk premium to compensate.

If all three of the above conditions are ful!lled, then the UIP condition will not hold due to the existence of

a risk premium which represents the compensation required by private agents for accepting risk exposure

above the minimum possible. When a risk premium exists, then the UIP condition no longer holds and

instead a more relevant equation is given by:

_r_                          - _r_                          -                          - _Es_                           - _RP_ (7.32)

where _RP_ is the risk premium on the domestic currency.

According to equation (7.32) the UIP condition may no longer hold due to the existence of a risk premium.

Imagine that domestic bonds require a 2% risk premium over foreign bonds. Ten a possible numerical

example of equation (7.32) is as follows:

10% – 5% = 3% + 2%

Tat is, the domestic bonds have an expected return of 10%, while foreign bonds have an expected return of

- nly 8% (that is, 5% interest plus a 3% expected appreciation of the foreign currency; that is, a 3% expected
depreciation of the domestic currency). Te reason for this is that domestic bonds are regarded as more risky
by investors, which is reflected by a 2% risk premium on the domestic bonds. In principle, of course, there is
no real reason why domestic bonds need to be considered more risky than foreign bonds; it may well be the
reverse, which would be reflected by a negative risk premium on the domestic bonds such that the expected
rate of return on domestic bonds is lower than on foreign bonds.

Te most simple formulation of the risk premium on the domestic currency is to say that it is positively

related to the supply of domestic bonds and negatively related to the supply of foreign bonds. One means of

expressing such a function in log form is given by:

_RP_ - [�] - - _b_ - � _s_ _f_

(7.33)

where + is a constant, _b_ is the log of domestic bonds in the hands of private agents, _s_ is the log of the exchange

rate, _f_ is the log of foreign currency denominated bonds in the hands of private agents, and * is a parameter

measuring the degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds.

Te !rst element + is a constant term; when it is positive it means that there is a preference for domestic

bonds, but if it is negative there is a preference for foreign bonds. Te more interesting is the second part

- f the equation, which suggests that when we increase the holdings of domestic bonds in private agents'
portfolios the risk premium on the domestic currency rises (or risk premium on the foreign currency falls),

171

International Finance

because there will be an increase in the proportion of domestic bonds in agents' portfolios which increases

the domestic risk to agents' portfolios and requires a rise in the risk premium on the domestic currency to

compensate investors for the increased risk exposure to domestic bonds in their portfolios. On the other hand,

a depreciation of the exchange rate (a rise in _s_ ) will lead to a fall in the risk premium required on domestic

bonds (or a rise on the risk premium on foreign bonds), because a depreciation of the domestic currency

increases the domestic currency value of foreign bonds held in private agents' portfolios and so increases the

risk exposure to foreign bonds, so lowering the risk premium required on domestic bonds. Similarly, a rise in

foreign bond holdings will lead to a fall in the risk premium required on domestic bonds, because this results

in a rise in the proportion of foreign bonds held in private agents' portfolios and so increases the risk exposure

to foreign bonds, thus lowering the risk premium required on domestic bonds (or raising the risk premium on

foreign bonds). Te parameter * is crucial as it is a measure of the degree of substitutability between domestic

and foreign bonds. As we raise the value of *, domestic and foreign bonds become closer substitutes, and this

lowers the risk premium. In the limiting case when * approaches in!nity then domestic and foreign bonds are

perfect substitutes so that the risk premium vanishes, as can be readily veri!ed in equation (7.33).

If we insert equation (7.33) into equation (7.32) we obtain:

_r_                       - � _r_ _Es_                        -                       -                       - _b_                       - � _s_ _f_ (7.34)

                   -                    

which can be rewritten as:

_b_                 - � _s_ _f_                 -                 - ��( _r_                 - _r_                 -                 - _Es_  ) (7.35)

Equation (7.35) makes it clear that in order to hold more domestic currency denominated bonds, domestic

investors would require either a rise in the interest rate di$erential in favour of domestic bonds and/or an

expected appreciation of the domestic currency, that is, _Es˙_ < 0. Allowing for domestic and foreign bonds

to have di$erent characteristics is potentially very important, because money market and foreign exchange

- perations that influence the exchange rate a$ect the composition of domestic and foreign bonds in agents’
portfolios in di$erent ways. We shall be using equation (7.35) in the synthesis exchange rate model that
follows, hence it is important to understand the rationale behind the equation.

7.15 A SYNTHESIS PORTFOLIO BALANCE MODEL

Je$rey Frankel (1983 and 1984) extended his monetary synthesis equation (1979) to incorporate a portfolio

balance e$etc. Te basic derivation of his synthesis exchange rate equation is as follows (see Frankel, 1983).

One begins with a conventional domestic money demand function given by:

_m = p +_ ( _y –_ 2 _r_ (7.36)

where _m_ is the log of the domestic money supply, _p_ is the log of the domestic price level, _y_ is the log of

domestic real income, ( is money demand elasticity with respect to income, and 2 is money demand semielasticity with respect to the interest rate.

172

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

A similar money demand function is postulated for the foreign country, and assuming identical elasticities

for the foreign economy we have:

_m_ *= _p_ *+ ( _y_ *– 2 _r_            - (7.37)

where an asterisk represents a foreign variable.

Taking the di$erence of the two equations yields the relative money demand function:

( _m–m*_ ) = ( _p–p*_ ) + (( _y–y*_ ) – 2( _r–r*_ ) (7.38)

By invoking long-run PPP, the long-run equilibrium exchange rate _S_ can be expressed in log form as the

di$erence between the long-run price levels:

_s_                            - _p_                            - _p_                            - (7.39)

where ~~_p_~~ is the log of the long-run domestic price level, and ~~_p_~~ - is the log of the long-run foreign price level.

Substituting equation (7.39) into equation (7.38) and rearranging gives the following expression for the

long-run equilibrium exchange rate:

~~_s_~~                    - ( _m_                    - _m_ *)                    -                    - ( _y_                    - _y_ *)                    -                    - ( _r_                    - _r_ *) (7.40)

Rather than assume UIP, which is inconsistent with a portfolio balance framework, we use equation (7.35),

repeated here as equation (7.41):

_b_                - � _s_ _f_                -                -                -                - ( _r_                - _r_                -                - _Es_  ) (7.41)

where + is a constant, _b_ is the log of domestic bonds in the hands of private agents, and _f_ is the log of foreigncurrency-denominated bonds in the hands of private agents. Tat is, in order to hold more domestic-currencydenominated bonds domestic investors would require either a rise in the interest rate di$erential in favour

- f domestic bonds and/or an increased expected appreciation of the domestic currency (expected fall in the
exchange rate). Te parameter * measures the degree of substitutability: if * is equal to in!nity then moving it
and + to the le,-hand side yields the UIP condition.

Te expected change in the exchange rate is given by the following expression:

  

_Es_                   -                   - ( ~~_s_~~                   - _s_ )                   - _Pe_                   - _Pe_                   - (7.42)

where 1 is the speed of adjustment to equilibrium, _Pė_ is the expected long-run domestic inflation rate, and

_Pė*_

is the expected long-run foreign inflation rate. Tat is, the expected rate of change in the exchange rate is

determined by the speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium rate 1, the gap between the current and

long-run exchange rate and the expected inflation di$erential.

Solving for _Es˙_ in equation (7.41) we !nd that:

_Es_                    - [���] _b_ _s_ _f_                   -                   -                   - � _r_ _r_                   - (7.43)

173

International Finance

Tus, substituting (7.43) into (7.42) and rearranging we !nd that:

_s_                 - _s_                 - _b_                 - � _s_ _f_                 -                 -                 - 1 ( *�� _r_                 - _Pe_  *)                 - ( _r_                 - _Pe_  )�� (7.44)

             - �             

Finally, substituting our expression for the long-run equilibrium exchange rate given by equation (7.40) into

equation (7.44), and a,er some algebraic manipulation, we obtain an exchange rate equation that synthesizes

both the monetary and portfolio balance approaches to exchange rate determination, given by:

Te fully flexible price monetarist version postulates that as both the parameters 1 and * approach in!nity,

this reduces equation (7.46) to the flexible-price monetary equation (7.8). Te sticky-price monetarist school

holds that 1 is less than in!nite while * is in!nite, so we end up with the real interest di$erential equation

(7.31). On the other hand, the sticky-price portfolio balance model holds that both the parameters 1 and * are

less than in!nite, so that relative bond supplies have an impact on the exchange rate – the relevant equation

is therefore (7.46).

7.16 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO BALANCE MODEL

Te portfolio balance model is an important contribution to the exchange rate literature because it allows a

role for changes in perceived risk or risk-aversion in the determination of the exchange rate. For example, an

increase in the perceived riskiness of foreign bonds compared to domestic bonds can lead to both a fall in the

domestic interest rate and an appreciation of the domestic currency as private agents rebalance their portfolios.

On the other hand, an increase in the perceived riskiness of domestic bonds can lead to a depreciation of the

domestic currency and/or a rise in the domestic interest rate. Tese e$ects accord with intuition and are

frequently invoked to explain observed exchange rate changes. Such an e$etc is, however, absent from the

monetary models which assume that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes.

Another important contribution of the portfolio balance model is that there is a signi!cant role for the

current account to play in the determination of the exchange rate over time. A current account surplus implies

an accumulation of foreign assets (for example, foreign bonds) and an increase in domestic wealth – the result

is a larger proportion of foreign bonds in investors' portfolios than they desire. In turn, this leads to purchases

- f domestic bonds and a resulting appreciation of the domestic currency which will, over time, work to reduce
a current account surplus.

174

Modern Models of Exchange Rate Determination

Another contribution of the portfolio balance model is that it permits a relatively easy discussion of the

role of !scal policy in determining the exchange rate. A bond-!nanced !scal expansion has an ambiguous

e$ect on the exchange rate. Tis is because, while a higher proportion of domestic bonds in agents’ portfolios

will lead to an increase in the demand for foreign bonds, the higher domestic interest rate will lead to a fall in

the demand for foreign bonds. If the former e$etc is greater than the latter, the exchange rate depreciates; but

if the reverse is true, the exchange rate appreciates.

A signi!cant policy implication that emerges from the portfolio balance model is that a given change in

the money stock has a more powerful e$ect on the exchange rate when carried out by a purchase of foreign

assets (a FXO) than when achieved via a purchase of domestic assets (an OMO). To understand this, consider

a FXO whereby the central bank purchases foreign currency bonds, which increases the domestic money

supply but, by reducing private agents’ holdings of foreign bonds, induces them to sell domestic bonds and

purchase foreign ones, placing additional pressure for the domestic currency to depreciate. If, however, the

central bank undertakes an open market operation and expands the money supply by purchasing domestic

bonds, then the exchange rate will depreciate due to the rise in the relative money supply, the purchases of

domestic bonds create a shortage of these in private agents’ portfolios which they will try to o$set by selling

some foreign bonds to purchase domestic bonds which will to some extent reduce the depreciation of the

domestic currency compared to an FXO.

Another important result that comes from the portfolio balance model is that when domestic and foreign

bonds are imperfect substitutes, then an SFXO has the potential to exert exchange rate e$ects which cannot

happen in the monetarist models. If the authorities buy foreign bonds with the domestic currency and then

mop up the increase in the money supply by selling domestic bonds, then they have e$ectively reduced private

agents' holdings of foreign bonds while increasing their holdings of domestic bonds with the money supply

remaining unchanged. According to the portfolio balance model, the increase in the supply of domestic bonds

and decrease in the supply of foreign bonds held by the private sector will induce agents to attempt to restore

equilibrium in their portfolios by selling domestic bonds to purchase foreign bonds, leading to a depreciation

- f the currency which will help in the process of rebalancing their portfolios since it will lead to an increase
in the domestic currency value of foreign bonds in their portfolios. Hence, if domestic and foreign bonds are
imperfect substitutes, then foreign exchange intervention that leaves the domestic money supply unchanged
may still a$ect the exchange rate. Te potential for sterilized foreign exchange to exert exchange rate e$ects is
an important theoretical and empirical issue because it suggests that to some extent authorities might be able
to keep the money supply level unchanged and yet still move the exchange rate.

7.17 CONCLUSIONS

A common characteristic of the three monetary models of exchange rate determination examined in this

chapter is that what matters for the exchange rate is the money supply in relation to money demand in both the

home and foreign countries. Te exchange rate is the relative price of two national monies and is consequently

a monetary phenomenon.

All the monetary models build upon PPP. Te flexible-price monetary model assumes that PPP holds

continuously and maintains that the price level adjusts instantaneously to changes in the supply and demand

for money. Tis then leads to immediate exchange rate adjustment to maintain PPP. Changes in real income

and inflation expectations induce changes in the exchange rate because they a$etc the demand for money. In

the sticky-price monetary models the asymmetric speeds of adjustment in goods and asset markets can lead

to divergences from PPP in the short run, although PPP reasserts itself in the long run.

175

International Finance

Te sticky-price monetary models provide an explanation of both exchange rate volatility and misalignment.

Exchange rates can become misaligned in relation to PPP because of the phenomenon of exchange rate

- vershooting, while instability in monetary policies can result in even greater instability in exchange rates.
An important point made by the sticky-price model is that both divergences from PPP and highly volatile
exchange rates can be explained by rational speculation and are not necessarily the result of 'irrational' foreign
exchange speculation.

Perhaps the most noticeable omission of the monetary models of exchange rate determination is an explicit

role for the current account to influence the exchange rate. Furthermore, domestic and foreign bonds are

regarded as perfect substitutes; that is, they are regarded as equally risky, so there is no role for risk perceptions

to play a part in the determination of exchange rates. By contrast, the portfolio balance model of exchange rate

determination has an explicit and important role for both of these factors to influence exchange rates.

One issue that is not explicitly dealt with by the portfolio balance model is the precise reason for the

perceived di$erences in risks between domestic and foreign bonds. Tis can be caused amongst other things

by unstable economic policies and di$ering perceived political risks. In the circumstance where unstable

economic policies create the risks, it may be best for the authorities to stabilize their economic policies. In the

case where political risks are an issue, the authorities might consider ways of reducing such perceived risks. In

summary, reducing perceived risks may be an important mechanism for reducing exchange rate fluctuations.

8.1 INTRODUCTION

Te monetary models of exchange rate determination make the crucial assumption that domestic and foreign

bonds are perfect substitutes. Tis implies that the expected yields on domestic and foreign bonds are equalized.

In e$ect, apart from their currency of denomination, domestic and foreign bonds are regarded by international

investors as the same. As we saw in Chapter 7, however, the portfolio balance model is distinguished from the

monetary models because it allows for the possibility that international investors may regard domestic and

foreign bonds as having di$erent characteristics other than their currency of denomination. In particular,

they might for various reasons regard one of the bonds as being more risky than the other. Tis being the case

they will generally require a higher expected return on the bond that is considered more risky to compensate

for the additional risk it entails.

Allowing for domestic and foreign bonds to have di$erent characteristics is potentially very important

because operations that influence the exchange rate a$etc the composition of domestic and foreign bonds in

agents' portfolios in di$erent ways. In this chapter we will use the portfolio balance model to examine three

- perations that are commonly used to influence the exchange rate:

1. An open market operation (OMO) which is de!ned as an exchange of domestic money base for

domestic bonds or vice versa.

International Finance

2. A foreign exchange operation (FXO) which is an exchange of domestic money for foreign bonds

	- r vice versa. Such foreign exchange market intervention a$ects the domestic money supply and is
termed a non-sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market.

3. A sterilized foreign exchange operation (SFXO) which is an exchange of domestic bonds for foreign

bonds or vice versa, leaving the domestic money base unchanged.

Te interesting thing about an SFXO is that it represents the di$erence between an OMO and FXO. An

expansionary FXO means that the authorities purchase foreign bonds with domestic money, which means

that the public holds more money and less foreign bonds. If the authorities decide they wish to keep the

money supply at its original level they can conduct a contractionary monetary policy by selling domestic

bonds to the public so that the money held by the public returns to its original level. If they conduct such a

sterilization operation, the net e$etc is that the public holds fewer foreign bonds and more domestic bonds

with the money supply unchanged.

In the monetary models the only thing that matters for the exchange rate is the money supply in relation to

the money demand, the source of money creation being unimportant. Tis means that in such models there

is no di$erence in the exchange rate and the interest rate e$ects of an FXO or OMO that change the money

supply by like amounts. Te reason is that in the monetary models there is no distinction between domestic

and foreign bonds. Within the context of the monetary models an SFXO will have no exchange rate or interest

rate e$ects because it leaves the money supply unchanged and is merely the exchange of domestic for foreign

bonds which are perfect substitutes.

In this chapter we will look at the portfolio balance model in more detail than was considered in Chapter

7. In particular, we examine the concept of a risk premium as being crucial to the portfolio balance approach

to exchange rate determination. We then look at di$erent types of risks that may make domestic and foreign

bonds imperfect substitutes and outline a simple version of the portfolio balance model, which we will use

to examine the di$ering e$ects of OMOs, FXOs and SFXOs. We then look at the results in the light of their

e$ects on the risk premium. Finally, we consider some of the dynamic features of the portfolio balance model.

8.2 THE CONCEPT OF A RISK PREMIUM

Te distinguishing feature of the portfolio balance model is that investors no longer regard domestic and

foreign bonds as perfect substitutes. Tis being the case the expected returns on the two assets no longer have

to be equal. In other words, the UIP condition which was a key condition in the monetary models generally

no longer holds. For example, if investors are risk-averse and regard domestic bonds as being relatively risky

as compared to foreign bonds, they will require a higher expected return on domestic bonds than foreign.

Tis additional expected return on the relatively risky as compared to the less risky bond is known as the 'risk

premium'. For a risk premium to exist, all of the following three conditions must be ful!lled (see Isard, 1983):

1. Tere must be perceived di$erences in risks between domestic and foreign bonds – the essence of a

risky asset being that its expected real rate of return is uncertain. Either domestic bonds are viewed

as relatively risky compared to foreign bonds, or vice versa. If the two bonds were equally risky then

with perfect capital mobility they must be perfect substitutes.

2. Tere has to be risk-aversion on the part of economic agents to the perceived di$erences in risk – the

principle of risk-aversion is that investors will only be prepared to take on increased risk if there is a

178

The Portfolio Balance Model

sufficient increase in expected real returns to compensate. If investors were not risk-averse then they

would not expect a higher return on relatively risky bonds.

3. Given the di$erent risks on domestic and foreign bonds there is a theoretical portfolio known as the

risk-minimizing portfolio which would minimize the risks facing private agents. Tere must be a

di$erence between the risk-minimizing portfolio and the actual portfolio, forced at market clearing

prices into investors' portfolios. However, the amount of domestic and foreign bonds held by private

agents is determined by the respective authorities that issue them. If the risk minimizing portfolio is

not held then agents will demand a risk premium as compensation.

If all three of the above conditions are ful!lled, then the UIP condition will not hold due to the existence of

a risk premium which represents the compensation required by private agents for accepting risk exposure

above the minimum possible:

_r_                     - _r_                     -                     - _Es_                      - _RP_ (8.1)

where _r_ is the domestic interest rate, _r_ - is the foreign interest rate, _Es˙_ is the expected rate of depreciation

- f domestic currency de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, and _RP_ is the risk
premium required on domestic bonds, which may be either positive or negative.

Te di$erence between equation (8.1) and the UIP condition (equation 7.1) is the risk-premium expression.

Te expected rate of return on domestic bonds may be higher (a positive risk premium) or lower (a negative

risk premium) when compared to foreign bonds. For example, if domestic bonds are regarded as more risky

than foreign bonds, and if the domestic interest rate is 10%, the foreign interest rate 6% and the expected

rate of depreciation of the domestic currency is only 3%, then there is a 1% risk premium on the domestic

currency, foreign assets have an expected yield of 9%, the interest rate is 6% and there is a 3% expected

appreciation of the foreign currency, which is lower than the 10% yield on domestic bonds. Te 1% positive

risk premium on the domestic currency is a negative 1% risk premium on the foreign currency. An issue that

we need to examine briefly concerns the types of risk that may cause the emergence of a risk premium.

8.3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF RISK

When analysing risk, economists make some postulates about economic agents. Investors are assumed to

be rational in that they wish to maximize their expected utility which is a positive function of expected real

returns and a negative function of the perceived level of risk. Te basis of investors' portfolio decisions is

choosing an optimum combination of expected rate of return and risk, given their risk–return preferences

(degree of risk-aversion). Te less risk-averse investors are, the more they will be prepared to take on risk.

Conversely, the more risk-averse they are, the less risk they will be prepared to take on.

In the !rst instance we need to de!ne a risky asset. Te de!nition of a risky asset is that its expected real

rate of return is uncertain. In other words, economic agents for various reasons cannot be sure what the value

- f the return in terms of purchasing power will be.

Typically, risks fall into one of two main categories (see Wihlborg, 1978): 'currency risks' and 'country

risks'. Currency risks arise because domestic and foreign bonds are denominated in di$erent currencies, while

country risks arise because they are issued by countries with di$erent legal jurisdictions and di$erent political

regimes.

179

International Finance

_Currency risks_

Tere are two types of currency risk that we shall consider: one is called 'inflation risk' and the other is termed

'exchange risk'.

 **Inflation risk.** Tis type of risk occurs because the inflation rates in the domestic and foreign
economies are uncertain. If PPP were to hold continuously, the real rate of return on the domestic
bond is given by the nominal interest rate less the expected domestic inflation rate ( _Pė_ ). If the latter
is uncertain then so will be the real return on the asset considered. Similarly, the expected real rate

    - f return on foreign bonds is given by the nominal foreign interest rate less the expected foreign

inflation rate ( _Pė*_ ) – if the latter is also subject to uncertainty then so will be the real return on

foreign bonds.

If PPP holds continuously and the expected domestic price inflation rate rises, this reduces the

expected real rate of return on domestic bonds but does not increase the expected real rate on foreign

bonds because the currency will depreciate by the same amount as the expected inflation rate. Te

risk of holding a domestic bond can therefore be represented as a positive function of the variance in

the domestic inflation rate while the risk of holding a foreign bond can be represented as a positive

function of the variance of the foreign inflation rate. A greater variance of the expected domestic

inflation rate raises the relative riskiness of domestic as compared to foreign bonds and vice versa.

 - **Exchange risk.** If PPP holds continuously, then inflation risk would be the sole currency risk facing
international investors. However, as we saw in Chapter 6, there is an overwhelming weight of
empirical evidence, since the advent of floating exchange rates, for rejecting the use of PPP as a valid
approximation of short-run exchange rate determination. Tis being the case, one then has to take
into account deviations from PPP when calculating the expected real rate of return on domestic and
foreign bonds during the holding period. While the expected real rate of return on domestic bonds
is given by the nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of inflation, the expected rate of return
from holding foreign bonds is now given by the foreign interest rate less the expected rate of inflation
plus the expected deviation of the exchange rate from PPP. For simplicity, let us assume that inflation
and domestic and foreign interest rates are equal and exchange rates are initially at PPP. In this case an
expected real depreciation of the currency in terms of PPP means that there is an expected appreciation

	- f the foreign currency, implying an increased expected return from holding foreign bonds. Te
expected real rate of return on domestic bonds is, however, una$ected by such deviations from PPP.

Te expected deviation of the exchange rate from PPP causes a risk speci!c to foreign bonds given

by the variance of the expected deviation from PPP. Tat is, fluctuations in the exchange rate that

cause deviations from PPP constitute a risk speci!c to foreign investments which is called 'exchange

risk'. Exchange rate changes only cause exchange risk to the extent that they represent deviations from

PPP. If exchange rate changes ensure that PPP holds, then they do not constitute such exchange rate

risk. Teoretically, therefore, exchange rate fluctuations are an incorrect measure of exchange risk. It

is fluctuations of the exchange rate around PPP that constitute exchange rate risk.

_Country risks_

Country risks are somewhat less amenable to economic analysis than currency risks. Nevertheless, since the

de!nition of a risky asset is that its expected real rate of return is uncertain, it is not difficult to conceptualize

country risks. Country risks can be divided into three types – exchange control risk, default risk and political risk.

180

The Portfolio Balance Model

 - **Exchange control risk.** Tis is a type of country risk whereby investors face uncertain real rates of
return. Te real rate of return on domestic and foreign bonds may be uncertain due to the risk of the
imposition of a tax on the interest element during the holding period. Tis risk may be greater or less
for domestic as compared to foreign bonds.

 - **Default risk.** Another, more serious, country risk is 'default risk' whereby a government refuses to
pay the interest and sometimes the principal on bonds issued by them and denominated in a foreign
currency. Note that the bonds need to be denominated in foreign currency because a government will
not default on bonds issued in its own currency since, in that case, it could always print the money to
redeem the bonds.

 - **Political risk.** Tis risk covers an extremely broad range of scenarios, but basically refers to the
danger that investors face because the political environment in a country could cause them to lose
part or all of their investment, including returns due, or to !nd costly restrictions imposed on how
they may manipulate their investments.

From the above discussion we can see that there are a variety of reasons why domestic and foreign bonds

may have di$erent relative riskiness, which is a necessary precondition for making them imperfect substitutes.

What matters to produce imperfect asset substitutability and a risk premium is perceived di$erences in risks

between domestic and foreign bonds. If assets are regarded as equally risky, then with perfect capital mobility

they must be perfect substitutes.

8.4 A PORTFOLIO BALANCE MODEL

Te portfolio balance model of exchange rates was pioneered by Branson (1976, 1984), Branson et al. (1977),

Branson and Henderson (1985) and Kouri (1976) and has been subsequently modi!ed and extended in various

directions by Obstfeld (1980), Girton and Henderson (1977), Allen and Kenen (1980) and Kenen (1982). Te

model we shall look at is based upon Branson (1976) and Kouri (1976). Tis model is a simple version of many

portfolio balance models because it utilizes the assumption of static exchange rate expectations; that is, the

exchange rate is not expected to change. Te _Es_ ˙ expression in equation (8.1) is assumed to be zero.

In the model outlined we assume that domestic prices and output are !xed following a policy disturbance.

Tis means the focus of the analysis is on the accumulation or decumulation of foreign assets resulting from

imbalances in the current account following an operation to influence the exchange rate. A current account

surplus means that the country is building up a stock of claims on the rest of the world, as represented by

increased holdings of foreign bonds; while a de!cit in the balance of payments corresponds to a decline in

foreign bond holdings. Te operation of the portfolio balance model is shown in Figure 8.1.

An OMO, FXO or SFXO creates a disturbance in asset-holders' portfolios requiring a change in the

exchange rate and domestic interest rate. Tese changes then lead to e$ects on output and the current account.

A current account surplus/de!cit leads to an accumulation/decumulation of foreign assets, which leads to

further changes in assets-holders' portfolios with implications for the exchange rate and domestic interest

rate, and so on until the model is restored to long-run equilibrium.

In the model that follows, we can distinguish between OMOs and FXOs because domestic and foreign

bonds are assumed to be imperfect substitutes. Tis means that an SFXO which represents the di$erence

- f an FXO and an OMO becomes feasible. Te model follows the portfolio balance framework developed
by Branson and the analysis focuses on a 'small country' in the sense that it can influence its real exchange
rate without provoking a reaction from the rest of the world. Tis assumption enables the derivation of some

181

International Finance

**Figure 8.1** Te operation of the portfolio balance model

concrete results; the point that the foreign country's reaction may reinforce or o$set the policy pursued by the

home country is self-evident. In addition, because the domestic economy is small, its assets are assumed not

to be of any interest to the rest of the world and hence they are held only by domestic residents.

Tere are a number of simplifying assumptions that we shall make at the outset: that both the domestic and

foreign price levels and the real domestic output are !xed. We do, however, discuss the possible implications

- f OMOs, FXOs and SFXOs on real output in section 8.10.

_The model_

Tere are assumed to be three assets that are held in the portfolios of private agents and the authorities:

1. Domestic monetary base, _M_ ;
2. Domestic bonds denominated only in the domestic currency, _B_ ;
3. Foreign bonds denominated only in the foreign currency, _F_ .

Domestic bonds may be held by either domestic private agents or the authorities. Tus, we may denote the net

supply of domestic bonds which is assumed to be !xed as:

_B_              - Bp              - Ba (8.2)

where _B_ is the !xed net supply of domestic bonds, _B_ p is the domestic bond holdings of private agents and _B_ a

is the domestic bond holdings of the authorities.

Similarly, the country's net holding of foreign bonds is held by private agents and the authorities, which we

assume in our analysis to be positive in both cases and equal to the summation of previous current account

surpluses. Unlike the stock of domestic bonds, the holdings of foreign assets may be increased or decreased

- ver time via a current account surplus or de!cit. Tus, we have:

_F_               - _F_               - _R_ (8.3)

_p_

where _F_ is the net foreign bond holdings of the country, _Fp_ is the foreign bond holdings of private agents and

_R_ is the stock of foreign bonds held by the authorities as foreign exchange reserves.

182

The Portfolio Balance Model

Te domestic monetary base liability of the authorities is equivalent to the assets of the authorities

so%that:

_M_         - _Ba_         - _SR_ (8.4)

where _S_ is the exchange rate de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, _SR_ is the exchange

rate ( _S_ ) times the reserves ( _R_ ). For simplicity it is assumed that capital gains or losses to the authorities as a

result of exchange rate changes do not a$etc the monetary base.

Total private !nancial wealth ( _W_ ) at any point in time is given by the identity:

_W_         - _M_         - _Bp_         - _SFp_ (8.5)

An important point concerning equation (8.5) is that the domestic currency value of foreign bonds is

given by the value of foreign bonds times the exchange rate, de!ned as domestic currency units per unit

- f foreign currency; that is, _SFp_ . Tis means that an excess demand for foreign bonds can be partly met by
a depreciation (rise) of the domestic currency which raises the domestic currency value of foreign bond
holdings.

Te demand to hold money by the private sector is inversely related to the domestic interest rate, inversely

related to the expected rate of return on foreign bonds, and positively related to domestic income and wealth.

Tis yields:

_M_       - _m r_ (, _E Ys_ ,, _W m_ ) r       - 0, _m_ s        - 0, _m_ y       - 0 _and m_ w� 0 (8.6)

where _r_ is the domestic nominal interest rate, _Es˙_ is the expected rate of depreciation of the domestic currency,

_Y_ is domestic nominal income, and _m_ r, _m_ s˙, _m_ y and _m_ w are partial derivatives.

Te demand to hold domestic bonds as a proportion of private wealth is positively related to the domestic

interest rate, inversely related to the expected rate of return on foreign assets, inversely related to domestic

nominal income and positively related to wealth. Tis yields:

_B_ p          - _b r E_ (, _s_ , _Y W b_, ) r          - 0, _b_ s           - 0, _b_ y          - 0 _and_ _bw_          - 0 (8.7)

where _b_ r, bs˙, _b_ y and _b_ w are partial derivatives.

Te demand to hold foreign bonds is inversely related to the domestic interest rate, positively related to

the expected rate of return from holding foreign bonds, inversely related to domestic nominal income and

positively related to wealth. Tis yields:

_SF_ p           - _f r E Y W f_ (, _s_ ,, ) _r_           - 0 _,_ _fs_            - 0, _f_ y           - 0 _and_ _f_ w           - 0 (8.8)

where _f_ r, _f_ s˙, _f_ y and _f_ w are partial derivatives.

Since any increase in wealth is held as either money, bonds or foreign bonds, then the sum of the partial

elasticities with respect to wealth must sum to unity; this is known as the balance sheet constraint and is given

by the identity:

_m_ w             - _b_ w             - _f_ w             - 1 (8.9)

183

International Finance

Te balance sheet identity is coupled with the assumption that assets are gross substitutes, implying the

following constraints on the partial derivatives:

_m_ r            - _b_ r            - _f_ r            - 0 (8.10)

_m_ s             - _b_ s             - _f_ s             - 0 (8.11)

From equation (8.10), it can be inferred that the demand for domestic bonds is more responsive to the

domestic interest rate than foreign bond demand, while the demand for domestic bonds is less responsive

to the foreign bond yield than foreign bond demand. Also, from equation (8.11) it can be inferred that the

demand for domestic bonds is less responsive to the expected rate of return on foreign bonds than foreign

bond demand.

Te current account balance is crucial to the dynamics of the system because the current account surplus

gives the rate of accumulation of foreign assets. Tat is:

_F_

. _p_ _T_ _r_ *( _Fp_ _R_ ) (8.12)

_C_

dd _Ft_ p _F_ . _p_ _T_ _r_ *( _Fp_ _R_

p

d

where _C_ is the current account surplus measured in foreign currency, _T_ is the trade balance measured in

foreign currency and _r_ - is the foreign interest rate.

The current account is made up of two components: the revenue from net exports (the trade balance)

and interest rate receipts from net holdings of foreign assets. Net exports are assumed to be a positive

function of the real exchange rate, inversely related to domestic income via the marginal propensity. This

yields:

_T_             - _T S P Y_             - /,,� _T_ s             - 0 _and T_ y             - 0 (8.13)

where _P_ is the domestic price level and _T_ s and _T_ y are partial derivatives.

Te assumption that net exports are a positive function of the real exchange rate is quite strong because it

rules out the possibility that there may be an initial J-curve e$etc on the trade balance; the assumption implies

that the Marshall–Lerner condition always holds.

8.5 DERIVATION OF THE ASSET DEMAND FUNCTIONS

We now proceed to analyse the e$ects of OMOs, FXOs and SFXOs on the exchange rate and domestic interest

rate using a comparative static framework. To make things easier we set the initial value of the exchange rate

_S_ and level of wealth equal to unity. Taking the total di$erential of equation (8.5) we obtain:

_dW_           - _dM_           - _dB_           - _F dS_ p           - _S dF_ p (8.14)

184

The Portfolio Balance Model

Taking the total di$erentials of the asset market functions given by equations (8.6) to (8.8) we obtain:

_dM_        - _m dr_ r        - _m E_ s  _d s_         - _m_ w ( _dM_        - _dB_ p        - _F dS_ p        - _S dF_ p ) (8.15)

_dB_ p          - _b dr_ r          - _b dE_ s  _s_           - _b_ w ( _dM_          - _dB_ p          - _F dS_ p          - _S dF_ p ) (8.16)

_dSF_ p           - _f dr_ r           - _f_ s  _dEs_  + _f_ w ( _dM_           - _dB_ p           - _F dS_ p           - _S dF_ p ) (8.17)

Setting the le,-hand side of the above equations to zero and noting that because of static exchange rate

expectations _dEs˙_ = 0, we can obtain the slope of the various asset market schedules in the interest rate–

exchange rate plane.

_The money market schedule_

Te money market (MM) schedule in Figure 8.2 shows various combinations of the domestic interest rate for

which money supply is equal to money demand. Keeping the money supply !xed (d _M_ = O) and since d _Es_ ˙ = 0

from equation (8.15) we !nd that the MM schedule has a positive slope given by:

!nd that the FF schedule has a negative slope given by:

8.6 EQUILIBRIUM OF THE MODEL

Te asset market of the model is in equilibrium when all three asset markets, that is the money markets and

the domestic and foreign bond markets, clear at the appropriate domestic interest rate and exchange rate. Tis

is illustrated in Figure 8.2.

Te MM schedule depicts equilibrium in the domestic money market and is upward-sloping from le, to

right in the interest rate–exchange rate plane. Te reason for this is that a depreciation (rise) of the exchange

rate leads to an increase in the value of domestic residents' wealth as it raises the domestic currency value of

their holdings of foreign bonds. Tis being the case, they will wish to hold more domestic money, but given

the existing money stock the increased money demand can only be o$set by a rise in the domestic interest

rate. An increase in the money supply for a given exchange rate requires a fall in domestic interest rate to be

willingly held, implying a rightward shi, of the MM schedule.

Te BB schedule depicts equilibrium in the domestic bond market, and is downward-sloping from le, to

right. A depreciation by raising domestic wealth also leads to an increased demand for domestic bonds which,

given the existing stock of domestic bonds, can only be o$set by a fall in the domestic interest rate which will

reduce their attractiveness to investors. An increase in the domestic bond supply for a given exchange rate

requires a rise in the domestic interest rate for the bonds to be willingly held, implying a rightward shi, of

the BB schedule.

Finally, the FF schedule depicts equilibrium in the foreign bonds market, and slopes downward from le,

to right. A rise in the interest rate on domestic bonds makes them relatively more attractive as compared to

foreign bonds, inducing agents to sell foreign bonds to purchase domestic bonds, leading to an appreciation

- f the domestic currency. An increase in the supply of foreign bonds, given the assumption of a !xed foreign
interest rate and a given exchange rate, requires a fall in the domestic interest rate for the foreign bonds to be
willingly held, implying a le,ward shi, of the FF schedule.

186

The Portfolio Balance Model

Te FF schedule is steeper than the BB schedule on the assumption that changes in the domestic rate of

interest a$ect the demand for domestic bonds more than they influence the demand for foreign bonds. Te

di$erent slopes of the BB and FF schedules shows that the two assets are regarded by private agents as di$erent.

We will now proceed to examine the short-run e$ects of an FXO, OMO and SFXO respectively. In each

case, we shall assume that the operation is designed to produce a depreciation of the exchange rate so as to

improve the international competitiveness of the country.

8.7 THE EFFECTS OF AN FXO

With an expansionary FXO, the authorities purchase foreign bonds from the private sector with the newly

created monetary base. Tis means that there is an increase in the private sector's holdings of money and an

equivalent fall in their holdings of foreign bonds (d _M_ = – _S_ d _F_ p = _S_ d _R_ ). Te short-run e$ects of an FXO are

shown in Figure 8.3.

An FXO is an exchange of domestic money for foreign assets and will lead to a rightward shi, of the

MM and FF schedules. Since agents hold fewer foreign assets than before the operation, we know that the

exchange rate will have depreciated to _S_ 2 and the domestic interest rate must have fallen to _r_ 2 at point B on

the unchanged BB schedule. Te exchange rate depreciation is required because the FXO creates a shortage of

foreign assets in agents' portfolios which can only be satis!ed in the short run by a depreciation which raises

the domestic currency value of agents' remaining holdings of foreign assets; while the fall in the interest rate

is required to encourage agents to hold the increased money stock.

8.8 THE EFFECTS OF AN OMO

With an expansionary OMO, the authorities increase the private sector holdings of money and decrease its

holdings of domestic bonds by an equivalent amount; that is, d _M_ = –d _B_ p = d _B_ a. Te e$ects of an OMO are

shown in Figure 8.4.

In contrast to an FXO, an OMO leaves the FF schedule unchanged while leading to a rightward shi, of the

money supply schedule from M1 to M2 and a le,ward shi, of the BB schedule from B1 to B2. Tis means that

there is a depreciation of the exchange rate and a fall in the domestic interest rate. Tis is because the OMO

creates an excess supply of money in agents' portfolios which leads to an increased demand for both domestic

and foreign bonds; this results in a fall in the domestic interest rate and a depreciation of the currency which

raises the value of foreign bond holdings.

8.9 THE EFFECTS OF AN SFXO

One means of comparing the relative e$ects of an OMO and FXO in the model is to combine the two operations

by having an expansionary FXO and a contractionary OMO of an equivalent amount. Tat is, the authorities

!rst purchase foreign assets with the domestic money base then o$set the increase in the monetary base by

selling domestic bonds. Such an operation represents a sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market,

since it leaves the domestic monetary base unchanged (d _M_ = – _S_ d _F_ p and –d _M_ = d _B_ p so that – _S_ d _F_ p = d _B_ p), and

is tantamount to the authorities altering the currency composition of bonds held in private portfolios. Te

e$ects of an SFXO are illustrated in Figure 8.5.

**Figure 8.5** Te e$ects of a sterilized foreign exchange operation

Te SFXO has the e$ect of increasing the supply of domestic bonds, shi,ing the BB schedule to the right

from B1 to B2, whilst decreasing agents’ holdings of foreign assets, shi,ing the FF schedule to the right from

F1 to F2; the MM schedule remains unchanged because the domestic money base is le, una$ected. Te net

e$etc of the operation is a depreciation of the exchange rate and a rise in the rate of interest. Te exchange rate

depreciates because the SFXO causes a shortage of foreign assets in agents' portfolios requiring an exchange

rate depreciation to achieve the desired holdings. Te interest rate rises because the excess supply of domestic

bonds in agents' portfolios depresses domestic bond prices.

Te fact that an SFXO can have exchange rate and interest rate e$ects in the portfolio balance model stands in

marked contrast to the monetary models examined in Chapter 7. In the monetary models, domestic and foreign

bonds are perfect substitutes, so a swap of domestic for foreign bonds by the authorities is an exchange of identical

assets as far as private agents are concerned. Hence, there is no need for interest or exchange rate changes. In

contrast, in the context of the portfolio balance model domestic and foreign bonds are regarded by economic

agents as di$erent assets, and this being the case an SFXO that increases agents' holdings of domestic bonds

while decreasing agents' holdings of foreign bonds causes a disequilibrium in agents' portfolios. Agents !nd

themselves with more domestic bonds than they want and fewer foreign bonds, which means that their portfolio

is more exposed to domestic risks. Equilibrium for agents' portfolios is restored by a higher domestic interest

rate – which compensates for the increased risk due to increased domestic bond holdings – and a depreciation of

the exchange rate – which reduces risk exposure by revaluing the remaining holdings of foreign assets.

8.10 A COMPARISON OF AN FXO, OMO AND SFXO

Having analysed all three operations separately, we can compare and contrast the short-run e$ects of the three

- perations together, as shown in Figure 8.6.

**Figure 8.6** Di$ering e$ects of an FXO, OMO and SFXO

In the !gure we can see the contrasting e$ects of the three operations. Te e$ects of an OMO and FXO

- n the domestic interest rate and exchange rate are qualitatively similar; however, an FXO leads to a larger
depreciation of the exchange rate, while an OMO leads to a larger fall in the domestic interest rate. Te
rationale for this result is that an FXO leads to a fall in agents' holdings of foreign bonds, while an OMO does
not – consequently an FXO creates a greater excess demand for foreign bonds which is satis!ed only by a
stronger depreciation of the exchange rate. By contrast, an OMO creates a greater shortage of domestic bonds
creating a greater excess demand for bonds which is o$set only by a larger fall in the domestic interest rate.

In the model, real output has been assumed to be !xed and, while this has the advantage of yielding some

clear and useful insights, it is also worth briefly considering the e$ects of an OMO and FXO on real output.

Dan Lee (1983) analysed the dynamics of an FXO and OMO in a model where the level of output in the short

run is endogenously determined. Te question he attempted to answer was whether an OMO or FXO would

have a more expansionary e$etc on domestic output. Using a portfolio balance framework he, too, found

that an expansionary OMO lowers the domestic interest rate more than an FXO, while the latter leads to a

larger depreciation of the exchange rate. He assumed that domestic investment is inversely related to the real

domestic interest rate and net exports are positively related to the real exchange rate.

Lee found that because an OMO has more e$ect on the domestic interest rate, its expansionary e$etc

- n output depends relatively more than an FXO on the responsiveness of investment to the fall in the real
interest rate that follows the operation; while the e$ect of an FXO on real output depends relatively more
than an OMO on the e$etc of the real exchange rate depreciation on the trade account balance. Overall, an
expansionary OMO may or may not have a greater e$etc on output than an expansionary FXO. If the response

- f the trade balance to changes in the real exchange rate is relatively weak and slower than that of investment
to interest rate changes, it will be the case that an OMO has a stronger e$etc on output. If, however, the foreign
sector is large and highly responsive to the real exchange rate we may be able to say the opposite. Tus Lee

190

The Portfolio Balance Model

concluded that at the theoretical level one cannot say whether an FXO or OMO will have a more expansionary

e$etc on output without imposing restrictions on the relevant parameters.

When comparing an FXO with an SFXO we !nd that the latter has a relatively weaker e$ect on the exchange

rate than in the case of an FXO; furthermore, the interest rate e$ects are opposite in sign. Te reason for

these di$ering e$ects is that an FXO increases the money stock which, by lowering the domestic interest

rate, encourages a greater excess demand for foreign assets leading to a greater depreciation. By contrast, an

SFXO increases the stock of domestic bonds requiring a higher domestic interest rate which, by reducing the

attractiveness of holding foreign bonds, limits the exchange rate depreciation.

In contrast to an FXO, the e$ects of an SFXO on real output will be ambiguous. Tis is because, while the

exchange rate depreciation will encourage net exports, the rise in the domestic interest rate will discourage

domestic investment. Even if the former outweighs the latter e$etc, so that there is a net increase in domestic

- output, the expansion will be less than in the case of an FXO because the exchange rate e$etc is weaker.

8.11 THE DYNAMICS OF THE MODEL

To distinguish between short-run and long-run equilibrium in the model we should note that in the long

run the current account should be in balance and the rate of change of the exchange rate should be zero. Tis

means that the country is neither increasing nor decreasing its foreign bond holdings and the exchange rate

is at its equilibrium value. Figure 8.7 illustrates the dynamics of the exchange rate and current account in the

model following an OMO, FXO or SFXO that causes an exchange rate depreciation, assuming that real output

remains !xed.

At time _t_ 1 there is an OMO, FXO or SFXO that causes a depreciation of the exchange rate from _S_ 1 to _S_ 2; with

prices !xed this means that there has been a real exchange rate depreciation. Te resulting improvement in the

country's international competitiveness moves its current account into surplus. A counterpart to the current

account surplus is that the country starts to accumulate more foreign bonds. Tis increases the proportion

- f foreign assets in the portfolios of investors, who, to reduce this risk exposure, start to purchase domestic
assets (most probably domestic bonds rather than money), leading to an appreciating exchange rate. In turn,
the exchange rate appreciation erodes the country's competitive advantage and so reduces the current account
surplus. Te dynamics come to an end when the exchange rate has appreciated sufficiently that the current
account is brought back into balance.

191

International Finance

One of the features of the model is that it is long-run and non-neutral with respect to the real exchange rate,

since the long-run exchange rate _S_ lies below the initial exchange rate _S_ 1. Tis is because the current account

surplus that follows an operation results in an accumulation of foreign assets and an accompanying increase

in the contribution of interest rate receipts from the holding of foreign assets on the service component of

the current account. As such, it is necessary for the real exchange rate to have appreciated in the long-run

equilibrium so that there is a deterioration of the trade account to o$set the improvement in the service

account and so ensure that the current account is restored to balance in the long run.

During the transition from the short run to the long run, the economy experiences an appreciating

currency and a current account surplus. Kouri (1983) labels this link the 'acceleration hypothesis'. It is worth

noting that the stable transition to equilibrium we have described depends crucially upon certain stability

conditions being ful!lled. Following an operation that causes an exchange rate depreciation which moves the

current account into surplus, there are two conflicting e$ects at work on the current account. First, the surplus

will induce an exchange rate appreciation which will work to eliminate the surplus. But, second, the current

account surplus also implies an accumulation of foreign assets and with it increased interest rate receipts

which improves the surplus. Consequently, for the appreciation of the exchange rate to reduce the surplus it is

necessary that the fall in net exports exceeds the increased interest receipts.

8.12 THE EFFECTS OF A CHANGE IN RISK PERCEPTIONS

A key feature of the portfolio balance model is that it provides a role for risk factors to influence exchange

rates which may account for some of the exchange rate changes experienced under floating exchange rates.

Consider the case where for some reason investors perceive that foreign bonds have become more risky as

compared to domestic bonds. Te e$ects of such a change in perceptions is illustrated in Figure 8.8.

Interest rate

**Figure 8.8** Foreign bonds become more risky

192

The Portfolio Balance Model

As a result of the perceived increase in risks attached to holding foreign bonds there is a decreased demand

for them and an increased demand for domestic bonds. Both the foreign bonds schedule F1 and the domestic

bonds schedule B1 shi, to the le, and the new schedules F2 and B2 intersect at point B. Te increased demand

_S_ to _S_ and a fall in the domestic

for domestic bonds is reflected in an appreciation of the exchange rate from 1 2

interest rate from _r_ 1 to _r_ 2.

Te exchange rate appreciation leads to a current account de!cit, which in turn leads to a decline in

foreign asset holdings which creates a shortage of foreign bonds in agents' portfolios who consequently try to

purchase foreign bonds leading to a depreciation of the exchange rate. Over time, the depreciation improves

the country's international competitiveness, so reducing the current account de!cit.

8.13 MONEY VERSUS BOND-FINANCED FISCAL EXPANSION

Tere are two ways that authorities may try to !nance increased government expenditure: one is by simply

printing extra money and using the money to directly !nance its expenditure; the other is to !nance

expenditure by borrowing, that is, by selling bonds to economic agents.

We now proceed to examine the short-run implications of these two alternative methods of !nancing

increased government expenditure within the context of the portfolio balance model. In the analysis we

shall ignore the possible expansionary e$ects of the increased expenditure on national income since this

considerably complicates the picture.

_Money-financed expenditure_

An increase in public expenditure !nanced by printing money means that investors will !nd that their wealth

has risen because they will hold more money and the same amounts of domestic and foreign bonds. Te problem

is that they will !nd that they have a larger proportion of money in their portfolios, and for this reason they

will demand more domestic and foreign bonds; the results of this portfolio adjustment are shown in Figure 8.9.

to

Te increased money supply is reflected in a rightward shi, of the money market schedule from M1

M2. It is worth noting that this shi, is less than in the case of an OMO which increases the money by a like

amount because the money supply increases wealth, a part of which is reflected in an increase in the demand

for money. In addition, the increase in wealth leads to an increase in the demand for both domestic and

foreign bonds: the bond market schedule shi,s to the le, from B1 to B2, while the foreign bond schedule shi,s

to the right. Te net e$etc of the money-based expansion is a depreciation of the exchange rate and a fall in

the domestic interest rate.

_Bond-financed expenditure_

An increase in public expenditure !nanced by borrowing will again increase investors' wealth because they

will hold more bonds and the same amounts of domestic money and foreign bonds. While the bond sales

reduce the public holdings of money, the money is then put back into private agents' hands by increased

government expenditure. In this instance, agents will !nd that they have a larger proportion of domestic

bonds in their portfolios than desired, which will lead investors to demand more money and foreign bonds;

the results of this portfolio adjustment are shown in Figure 8.10.

Te increase in the supply of bonds will shi, the BB schedule to the right from B1 to B2. Since investors

are holding more bonds and the same amount of money and foreign bonds their wealth must have

increased. Tis increase in wealth will lead to an increase in the demand for bonds, so reducing the extent

- f the rightward shi, of the bond schedule, and an increase in the demand for money, represented by a
le,ward shi, of the MM schedule. Te net e$etc on the demand for foreign bonds is uncertain. While the
rise in wealth will lead to increased foreign-bond demand, leading to a shi, of the foreign bond schedule
to the right, the rise in the domestic interest rate will lead to a substitution of demand away from foreign
bonds.

If the wealth e$ect dominates, the FF schedule moves to the right as in Figure 8.10(a) and equilibrium

is obtained at a higher interest rate and an exchange rate depreciation. Conversely, if the interest rate e$etc

dominates, the FF schedule moves to the right as in Figure 8.10(b), though equilibrium is obtained at a

higher interest rate and an exchange rate appreciation. Tus, !scal policy will have an ambiguous e$etc on the

exchange rate.

In this section we have seen that the impact of !scal expansion on the interest rate and exchange rate

depends not only on the size of the expansion but on how the policy is !nanced. If it is !nanced by

printing money this leads to a short-run depreciation and a fall in interest rates; while if it is !nanced by

borrowing, the e$ect is a rise in interest rates and the exchange rate may depreciate or appreciate. It is

important to remember that these are only the short-run results. Te money-!nanced !scal expansion

is likely to translate quickly into inflation as the expansionary !scal policy will be further boosted by the

exchange rate depreciation and the fall in the domestic interest rate. On the other hand, the e$ects of a

bond-!nanced !scal expansion on prices and output are likely to be less inflationary, because in the case

where the exchange rate depreciates the expansion of demand will be reined back to some extent by the

rise in interest rates. Demand will be even further restrained if the !scal expansion leads to an exchange

rate appreciation. In summary, a bond-!nanced !scal expansion will be less inflationary than a money!nanced expansion.

Before concluding this section, it is worth remembering that the rising US budget de!cit in the early 1980s

was primarily !nanced by US government bond sales, a rising US interest rate and an appreciating dollar. In

the context of the portfolio balance model this would suggest that the substitution e$ect of rising US interest

rates dominated the wealth e$etc as depicted in Figure 8.10. However, the more recent American !scal de!cits

since the start of the credit crunch in 2007 have involved quantitative easing (QE 1, QE 2 and QE 3) and the

printing of money, which has involved a falling US interest rate and a depreciating dollar, which is reflected

in Figure 8.9.

8.14 THE RISK PREMIUM, IMPERFECT AND PERFECT SUBSTITUTABILITY

Te portfolio balance model that we have examined in this chapter has been based upon the assumption

that domestic and foreign bonds are imperfect substitutes. Tis is shown by the fact that, although the

foreign interest rate is !xed and exchange rate expectations are static, the domestic interest rate could

diverge from the foreign interest rate. Te reason for this is that the di$ering operations influence the risk

premium, allowing the domestic interest rate to diverge from the foreign rate. Tis point is illustrated as

follows.

In the portfolio balance model the domestic interest rate can diverge from the foreign interest rate not only

because of exchange rate expectations, but also because of the risk premium, in accordance with equation

(8.1), which is repeated below as equation (8.21):

_r_                     - _r_                     -                     - _Es_                      - _RP_ (8.21)

Tis can be expressed in di$erence form as:

d _r_              - d _r_              -              - d _Es_               - d _RP_ (8.22)

Troughout we have been assuming static exchange rate expectations (d _Es_ ˙=0) and a !xed foreign interest rate

so that d _r_ - = 0. Substituting these values into equation (8.22) we !nd:

195

International Finance

d _r_ = d _RP_ (8.23)

Hence, all changes in the domestic interest rate can be interpreted as due to changes in the risk premium.

A rise in the interest rate reflects a rise in the risk premium on domestic assets, while a fall in the domestic

interest rate reflects a fall in the risk premium. In the case of perfect substitutability there is no risk premium,

so the UIP condition is the relevant equation, that is:

_r_                       - _r_                       -                       - _Es_  (8.24)

In di$erence form:

d _r_               - d _r_               -               - d _Es_  (8.25)

With static expectations and a !xed foreign interest rate this means:

d _r_ = 0 (8.26)

For this to be the case, both the BB and FF schedules must coincide and be horizontal at the world interest

rate _r_ *, as illustrated in Figure 8.11.

The Portfolio Balance Model

In the !gure, the BB and FF schedules are horizontal and coincide as represented by the schedule BF;

- nly changes in monetary policy as reflected by shi,s in the MM schedule can influence the exchange
rate. Tere is no distinction to be made between an OMO or FXO on the exchange rate. An SFXO leaves
the MM schedule unchanged and the BF schedule remains in the same position so that it has no exchange
rate or interest rate e$ects. A bond-!nanced !scal expansion will in this special case have an unambiguous
e$etc. Although the BF schedule remains at BF, the increased wealth resulting from the increased supply

- f bonds will raise money demand causing a le,ward shi, of the MM schedule and an exchange rate
appreciation.

8.15 CONCLUSIONS

Te portfolio balance model represents an important contribution to the exchange rate literature because

it allows a role for changes in perceived risk or risk-aversion in the determination of the exchange rate. An

increase in the perceived riskiness of domestic bonds compared to foreign bonds can lead to both a rise in

the domestic interest rate and a depreciation of the currency; while an increase in the perceived riskiness of

foreign bonds can lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency and a fall in the domestic interest rate.

Tese e$ects accord with intuition and are frequently invoked to explain observed exchange rate changes.

Such e$ects are, however, absent from the monetary models which assume that domestic and foreign bonds

are perfect substitutes.

Another important contribution of the portfolio balance model is that there is a signi!cant role for the

current account to play in the determination of the exchange rate over time. A current account surplus

implies an accumulation of foreign assets and an increase in wealth, and the result is a larger proportion of

foreign bonds in investors' portfolios than they desire. In turn, this leads to purchases of domestic bonds

and money and a resulting appreciation of the exchange rate which works to reduce the current account

surplus.

Another contribution of the portfolio balance model is that it permits a relatively easy discussion of the

role of !scal policy in determining the exchange rate. A bond-!nanced !scal expansion has an ambiguous

e$ect on the exchange rate, because, while a higher proportion of domestic bonds and an increase in assetholders’ wealth will lead to an increase in the demand for foreign bonds, the higher domestic interest rate will

lead to a fall in the demand for foreign bonds. If the former e$etc is greater than the latter the exchange rate

depreciates, but if the reverse is true the exchange rate appreciates.

A signi!cant policy implication that emerges from the portfolio balance model is that a given change in

the money stock has a more powerful e$ect on the exchange rate when carried out by a purchase of foreign

assets (an FXO) than when achieved via a purchase of domestic assets (an OMO). It is only in the limiting

case when domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes that the e$ects become identical. Tis is an

important result because it at least provides a rationale for the observed interventions of authorities in foreign

exchange markets.

Another result that emerges is that it is only by assuming that domestic and foreign bonds are imperfect

substitutes that an SFXO can exert exchange rate e$ects. However, even if an SFXO can a$etc the exchange

rate, it will have a relatively weaker e$ect on the exchange rate than an FXO. Te lesson for policy-makers is

that non-sterilized intervention has a more powerful e$etc on the exchange rate than sterilized intervention.

197

International Finance

One issue that is not explicitly dealt with by the portfolio balance model is the precise reason for the

perceived di$erences in risks between domestic and foreign bonds. Tis can be caused amongst other

things by unstable economic policies and di$ering perceived political risks. In the circumstance where

unstable economic policies create the risks, it may be best that the authorities stabilize their economic

policies. Where political risks are concerned the authorities might consider ways of reducing the perceived

risks. In summary, reducing perceived risks may be an important mechanism for reducing exchange rate

fluctuations.

9.1 INTRODUCTION

We have so far considered the exchange rate literature from a predominately theoretical viewpoint, but the

exchange rate !eld has also been rich in empirical research. Apart from investigations into the validity of PPP

theory which we examined in Chapter 6, empirical research on exchange rates has addressed three other key

questions:

Is the foreign exchange market efficient?

2. What model best predicts exchange rate movements?
3. How can we model the expectations of participants in the exchange market?

Answers to these questions are of enormous importance from a policy viewpoint. If it can be shown that

the foreign exchange market is 'efficient' then the case for government intervention in that market would be

considerably undermined. On the other hand, if we can identify a model that successfully explains exchange

rate determination, it would be possible for the authorities to determine the best way to influence exchange

rates and limit their volatility. Furthermore, the consequences of alternative economic policy measures could

be better evaluated as their implications for the exchange rate would be understood. Finally, if we understood

how the participants in the exchange market form their views on exchange rates, then policy-makers may be

able to use such information to help them in the process of stabilizing those rates.

International Finance

9.2 WHAT IS AN EFFICIENT MARKET?

Following Eugene Fama (1970, p. 383), an efficient market is conventionally de!ned as one 'in which prices

always "fully reflect" available information'. In the speci!c application to the foreign exchange market this

implies that market participants use all relevant available information bearing on the appropriate value of the

exchange rate to produce a set of exchange rates – spot and forward – that does not provide an opportunity for

unusual _ex ante_ pro!t opportunities. In other words, unusual pro!t cannot be made by speculators who make

exchange rate forecasts on a similar information set. In connection with this broad de!nition, there are two

key concerns. Is new information instantaneously and fully reflected in the exchange rate? What is relevant

and what is irrelevant information?

Tere are a number of tests that have been proposed to determine whether or not the foreign exchange

market is efficient. One of the most popular has been to see if the forward exchange rate systematically over

- r underpredicts the future spot exchange rate; if it were to do so then this would be indicative of foreign
exchange market inefficiency.

For example, suppose that the forward exchange rate were to systematically underpredict the value of the

future spot rate of a currency. Ten there would be a simple rule which could yield the speculator abnormal

pro!ts: buy the currency forward today, knowing that he can sell it when the contract is due at a higher value.

A numerical example will illustrate the point. Suppose the three-month forward rate of the dollar against

the euro is \$1.30/€1, and suppose that speculators know that this forward rate systematically underpredicts

the future rate by 5%. Tis means that the future spot exchange rate in three months’ time will be above

$1.30/€1 at $1.365/€1. Hence, by buying euros forward today for \$1.30/€1 a speculator will know that in three

months' time, when he is due to pay the \$1.30/€1, for each euro purchased forward he can immediately expect

\$1.365/€1 for each euro sold in the spot market at the time of ful!lment of the forward contract.

According to the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) the scenario depicted above would not persist because

the opportunity for abnormal pro!ts would lead to massive purchases of euros forward. Tis would lead to a

rise in the forward rate above \$1.30/€1 towards \$1.365/€1 until any abnormal pro!ts are eliminated.

However, there is a major problem with exchange market efficiency tests. Even if one were to discover that

the forward rate systematically overor underpredicted the future spot rate, this discrepancy is not necessarily

a sign of foreign exchange market inefficiency: it could be indicative of the existence of a risk premium in

the foreign exchange market. If the forward exchange rate of a currency were systematically to underpredict

its future spot exchange rate, as in our numerical example, this may be due to the existence of a positive risk

premium attached to the foreign currency. In our numerical example, the di$erence between the forward rate

- f \$1.30/€1 and the actual/expected future spot rate of \$1.365/€1 may be viewed as a \$0.065 risk premium on
the euro; that is, speculators will only buy euros forward if they expect to be able to sell them in the future
and make \$0.065 pro!t. Tis pro!t represents the compensation required by speculators to buy euros forward
which are regarded as more risky than dollars.

Hence, any expected excess pro!ts to be earned on buying the foreign currency forward are merely the

compensation required by an efficient foreign exchange market to compensate for the risks associated with

holding the foreign currency forward. If the forward exchange rate of the foreign currency is systematically

undervalued in relation to the future spot exchange rate, this may be evidence of the existence of a positive risk

premium attached to the foreign currency. Tat is, international investors require a higher expected return on

the foreign currency as compared to the domestic currency because they regard it as a relatively risky asset to

hold compared to the domestic currency. A positive risk premium on the foreign currency corresponds to a

negative risk premium on the domestic currency, and vice versa.

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

9.3 EXCHANGE MARKET EFFICIENCY TESTS

Te rational expectations hypothesis (REH) is particularly useful when examining the concept of exchange

market efficiency. Tis is because, like the EMH, it presumes that economic agents do not make systematic

errors when making their predictions. According to the REH, economic agents have a good knowledge of the

economic model relevant to predicting a variable so that they do not persistently overor underpredict the

future value of that variable. Applying rational expectations to the prediction of the future exchange rate we

!nd:

_s_ t 1� [�] _Es_ t                          - 1                          - _u_ t 1� (9.1)

where _s_ t+1 is the log of the actual spot exchange rate in one period's time de!ned as domestic currency units

per unit of foreign currency, _Es_ t+1 is the log of the expected exchange rate in one period's time and _u_ t+1 is a

random error term with a normal distribution and mean of zero.

Equation (9.1) says that the actual future exchange rate corresponds to that which was anticipated by

economic agents plus or minus some random error. Te next step is to assume that investors are risk-neutral

(that is, there is no risk premium) and so set the forward rate at a level that corresponds to the expected future

spot exchange rate. Tis gives:

_f_ t                                 - _Es_ t 1� (9.2)

where _f_ t is the log of the forward exchange rate at time _t_, de!ned as domestic currency units per unit of foreign

currency. Substituting equation (9.2) into equation (9.1) we obtain:

_s_ t 1� [�] _f_ t                          - _ut_                          - 1 (9.3)

Equation (9.3) states that, providing economic agents have rational expectations and there is no risk premium

in the foreign exchange market, then the future spot rate should be equal to today's quoted forward rate plus

a random error. In other words, on average the forward rate should neither overnor underpredict the actual

exchange rate.

Equation (9.3) constitutes a joint test of both exchange market efficiency and no risk premium. Te forward

rate may systematically overor underpredict the future actual exchange rate not because of exchange market

inefficiency, but because there is a positive or negative risk premium on the domestic currency. If a risk

premium is present we have to modify equation (9.2) to yield:

_Es_ t 1� [�] _f_ t                    - _RP_ t (9.4)

where _RP_ t is the risk premium on the foreign currency.

Substituting equation (9.4) into (9.1) yields:

_s_ t                          - 1                          - _f_ t                          - _RP_ t                          - _ut_                          - 1 (9.5)

201

International Finance

Equation (9.5) says that the forward rate may systematically overor underpredict the future spot rate because

- f the presence of a risk premium. If there is a positive risk premium on the foreign currency (negative
risk premium on the domestic currency) the one-period-ahead forward rate of the domestic currency will
systematically overvalue the domestic currency as compared to its actual rate one period ahead; whereas if
there is a negative risk premium on the foreign currency (positive risk premium on the domestic currency)
then the one-period-ahead forward rate of the domestic currency will systematically undervalue the currency
compared to its actual rate one period ahead.

Te early tests (see for example Levich, 1978 and Frenkel, 1982) of exchange market efficiency were based

- n equation (9.3) and set out as follows:

_s_ t 1�                          - _a_ 1                          - _a f_ 2 t                          - _u_ t 1� (9.6)

According to this test, if the foreign exchange market is efficient in the sense that the exchange rate (spot

and forward) incorporates all currently available information and there is no risk premium in the foreign

exchange market, then the forward rate will be an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Hence,

the expected sign of _a_ 1 is zero. If it were non-zero then the forward exchange rate would systematically over

- r underpredict the future spot exchange rate and rational economic agents could use this information to
make systematic pro!ts. Te coefficient _a_ 2 will be equal to unity showing that the forward exchange rate on
average correctly predicts the future spot exchange rate. Finally, the error term ( _u_ t) will possess the classical

- rdinary least squares properties. In particular, errors will be serially uncorrelated. By 'no serial correlation'
we mean that there is no statistically signi!cant relationship between the errors of one period and errors
made in other periods. One cannot forecast future errors on the basis of past errors. If agents could predict
future errors on the basis of past errors this would be a sign of foreign exchange market inefficiency; that is,
there would be unexploited pro!t opportunities. Te results of some of the studies of Levich and Frenkel for
equation (9.6) are reported in Table 9.1.

Te results presented in Table 9.1 were interpreted by the two authors as highly supportive of the joint

_a_ does not di$er

hypothesis of foreign exchange market efficiency and no risk premium. Te coefficient 1

signi!cantly from zero, while the coefficient _a_ 2 does not di$er signi!cantly from unity. In addition, the Durbin–

Watson statistic reveals that there is no !rst-order serial correlation in the residuals. Te adjusted R [2] for the

entire sample period is generally high, suggesting that most information is incorporated in the forward rate.

Te implication of these results is that the foreign exchange market is efficient and there is no risk premium.

Nevertheless, other authors, such as Hansen and Hodrick (1980), Meese and Singleton (1982) and Cumby

and Obstfeld (1984), have pointed out that the Levich/Frenkel regression is inappropriate if exchange rates

follow a non-stationary process – that is, there is some trend exchange rate appreciation or depreciation. In

this case, it is necessary to detrend the data in order for the regression estimates to be unbiased. Cumby and

Obstfeld argue that we should re-estimate the previous equation by running the following regression:

                          - _s_ t 1�                           - _s_ t                           -                           - _a_ 1                           - _a_ 2                           - _f_ t                           - _s_ t                           -                           - _u_ t 1� (9.7)

where _s_ t is the log of the spot exchange rate.

Equation (9.7) detrends equation (9.3) and as such constitutes a more powerful test of the EMH. It states

that a currency that is at a forward discount ( _f_ t– _s_ t) of _x_ % should on average depreciate by _x_ %, whereas a

currency that is at a forward premium ( _f_ t– _s_ t) of _x_ % should on average appreciate by _x_ %.

If the foreign exchange market is efficient and characterized by rational expectations, so that we can

substitute the actual exchange rate for the expected exchange rate, along with the assumption that there is no

risk premium, then one would again expect _a_ 1 to be zero and the coefficient _a_ 2 not to di$er signi!cantly from

unity, indicating that on average the realized change in the exchange rate is correctly forecast by the forward

premium/discount. Table 9.2 reports the results of Olmo and Pilbeam (2011) on equation (9.7) for a variety

- f currencies against the US dollar.

Te results of Olmo and Pilbeam, which con!rm the earlier !ndings of Boothe and Longworth (1986),

Cumby and Obstfeld (1984), Taylor (1989) and many other authors, reported in Table 9.2 show that one can

decisively reject the null hypothesis of exchange market efficiency on simple econometric grounds. Tese

results reveal that, once we take account of the trend in the exchange rate, market participants have on average

mispredicted the direction of movement of the exchange rate. As MacDonald and Torrance (1989) note in

a survey of these tests, the coefficient a2 is usually closer to minus one than the hypothesized value of unity!

Te tests of equation (9.7) suggest that on average currencies that were at a forward discount actually

appreciated, while those at a forward premium actually depreciated! Tis is a clear rejection of the joint

market efficiency test because it suggests that there exists a fairly simple rule for investors to make excessive

pro!ts – simply put, your money in a currency that is at a forward discount (because of the relatively high

interest rate in that country) and you will not only bene!t from the higher interest rate but also an exchange

rate appreciation of that currency. Tis is a clear violation of UIP.

A major problem with these decisive rejections is that because they are a joint test of exchange market

efficiency (rational expectations) and the non-existence of a risk premium, there is no clear-cut interpretation.

It may be evidence of exchange market inefficiency (that is, REH does not hold) or be indicative of the existence

- f a risk premium (possibly time-varying) in the foreign exchange market.

Tere has been some questioning of the econometric results of the 'called-forward discount puzzle' and

its economic signi!cance. For example Sarno et al. (2006) suggest that the linear relationship imposed by

using conventional linear regressions to test for UIP may not be appropriate due to non-linearities in the

data. Once these non-linearities are taken into account, they conclude (p. 476) 'that while UIP does not hold

most of the time, deviations from UIP are generally economically small'. Indeed, authors such as Olmo and

Pilbeam (2011) have shown that the negative _a_ 2 coefficients do not necessarily imply that excess pro!ts can

be made by borrowing in the low interest rate currency and putting it in the high interest rate currency as the

regression seems to imply. In addition, research by Lothian and Wu (2011), a,er looking at a data set covering

two centuries, suggests that, while there can be departures from UIP for sustained periods of time, in the long

run UIP is far more likely to hold and the negative beta coefficient is likely to be positive and close to unity.

**Box 9.1 Exchange market efficiency and the distinction between anticipated**
**and unanticipated economic policy**

Te EMH has some important implications for exchange rate dynamics in response to changes in

economic policy. Let us consider the case of monetary policy. When the foreign exchange market is

efficient it is only unanticipated monetary expansion that can cause discrete jumps in the exchange

rate. If a monetary expansion is anticipated to occur, market efficiency implies that there would be

no discrete jump in the exchange rate when the money supply expansion takes place because it has

already been appropriately discounted in advance. Figure 9.1 contrasts the e$ects of unanticipated and

anticipated money expansions in the context of the overshooting exchange rate model.

Figure 9.1(a) illustrates what happens if a money supply expansion takes place unannounced at time

_t_ 2, leading to a sudden discrete jump of the exchange rate from S1 to S2 which represents an 'overshoot'

from its long-run equilibrium rate _S_ ; therea,er, it tends back to the long-run value. Tis contrasts with

the dynamics of the exchange rate when the authorities announce at time _t_ 1 that they will expand the

money supply at time _t_ 2, which is shown in Figure 9.1(b). In this case, there would be an immediate

initial depreciation at the time of the announcement _t_ 1 to _S_ 2 which is followed by a gradual depreciation

204

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

9.4 ALTERNATIVE TESTS OF THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS

According to the EMH, the forward rate is supposed to embody all the relevant information concerning

the future expected spot exchange rate. Tis implies that it should not be possible to add a further variable

available at time _t_ to regression (9.3) which proves to be statistically signi!cant. Were it to do so, it could be

taken as evidence that the forward exchange rate does not contain all relevant information concerning the

205

International Finance

future spot exchange rate. An example of a regression that tests to see if another variable can improve the !t

- f regression (9.3) is:

_s_ t 1�                      - _a_ 1                      - _a f_ 2 t                      - _a f_ 3 t 1�                      - _u_ t 1� (9.8)

where _f_ t–1 is the log of the forward rate in the previous period.

According to the EMH a variable such as the previous period's forward exchange rate should not contain

any additional information relevant to the future exchange rate (that is, _a_ 3 should not be statistically di$erent

from zero). Using monthly data (July 1973 to September 1979) for the pound–dollar, French franc–dollar,

lira–dollar and Deutschmark–dollar, Edwards (1983b) found that the coefficient a3 is not statistically di$erent

from zero, suggesting that _f_ t–1 contains no useful additional information. Edwards' study is very supportive of

exchange market efficiency.

Another test of the EMH concerns an examination of the errors between the expected future exchange rate

and the actual future exchange rate. If the foreign exchange market is efficient then it should not be possible to

predict these errors on the basis of information available at the time the forecast is made. Tat is:

_u_ t 1�               - _a_ 1               - _a I_ 2 t               - _v_ t 1� (9.9)

where _u_ t+1 is the forecast error, that is _s_ t+1– _f_ t, _I_ t is a subset of information available at time _t_ ; and _v_ t+1 is a random

error term with a normal distribution and mean of zero.

If the foreign exchange market is efficient then the coefficient _a_ 2 should be equal to zero. Tat is, we cannot

put in any relevant economic variables at time _t_, such as the current spot exchange rate _s_ t, the previous period's

spot _s_ t–1 or lagged forward rate _f_ t–1, or any other known variable at time _t_ and use this to predict the error. Tis

efficiency test is known as the 'orthogonality property' and implies that agents use all relevant information in

making their forecasts so as to avoid predictable forecast errors. Te EMH holds that the forecast error _u_ t+1 is

due to unpredictable shocks and will be unrelated to any information available at the time expectations are

formed. Among the other information available at time _t_ is the previous period's forecast errors _u_ t. As such,

a test of the orthogonality assumption would be to see if the forecast error _s_ t+1– _f_ t = _u_ t+1 is independent of the

previous period's forecast error, _s_ t– _f_ t–1 = _u_ t. Tat is:

_s_ t 1�                       - _f_ t                       - _a_ 1                       - _a_ 2                       - _s_ t                       - _f_ t 1�                       -                       - _v_ t 1� (9.10)

where _v_ t+1 is a random normally distributed error.

Equation (9.10) can be rearranged to yield:

_s_ t 1�                       - _a_ 1                       - _a_ 2                       - _s_ t                       - _f_ t                       - 1                       -                       - _a f_ 3 t                       - _v_ t 1� (9.11)

According to the EMH if there is no risk premium and the foreign exchange market uses all information

efficiently then _a_ 1 = 0, _a_ 2 = 0 and _a_ 3 = 1. Frankel (1980) produces results for the French franc–dollar, pound–

dollar and Italian lira–dollar for the period July 1974–April 1978 using weekly data that leads to a rejection

- f the EMH.

Other tests of the EMH have been variations on the traditional tests. Most notably they have involved

using alternative proxies for the future expected exchange rate _Es_ t+1, other than the actual exchange rate at

206

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

time _t_ + 1. In addition, more sophisticated estimation techniques have been used, and two studies of particular

note are those of Clarida and Taylor (1997) and Clarida et al. (2003). Clarida and Taylor (1997), using a linear

framework, !nd that information from a series of forward exchange rates (4, 13, 26 and 52 weeks) can help to

beat a random walk forecast (that is, a forecast that the exchange rate one-period hence will be the same as the

current spot rate) by a margin of up to 40%. Clarida et al. (2003), using the same series of forward rates, and

non-linear techniques, show that there is information useful to forecasting the future spot exchange rate and

they are able to beat a random walk forecast by a margin of 27–31% at the four-week horizon and 5–68% at

the 52-week horizon, improving upon the linear framework of the Clarida and Taylor (1997) study. Finally, in

tests of the orthogonality property, authors have used a wider range of variables in the information set.

9.5 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS ON EXCHANGE MARKET EFFICIENCY

Tere has been a great deal of testing of the joint hypothesis of foreign exchange market efficiency and the

non-existence of a risk premium. Te problem with all these tests is that even when the joint hypothesis is

rejected there is no means of knowing whether this is due to the existence of a risk premium or due to the

failure of foreign exchange market efficiency.

Overall, the results of the various exchange market efficiency tests are fairly mixed depending upon the

currency and the particular test considered. Nonetheless, there is an accumulation of evidence suggesting

that for certain periods and certain rates the joint hypothesis does not hold. Speci!cally, tests of EMH using

the forward premium/discount as a prediction for the future appreciation/depreciation of the currency

convincingly reject the joint hypothesis.

Accepting that the joint hypothesis does not hold, then the big issue le, to resolve is whether or not the

rejection is due to the existence of a risk premium or the existence of inefficiency/non-rational expectations in

the foreign exchange market. At the theoretical level Frankel (1986) has argued that the risk premium if it does

exist is likely to be too small to account for the failure of exchange market efficiency tests. In addition, Frankel

(1986) and Rogo$ (1984) test to see if the risk premium behaves as predicted by the portfolio balance model;

that is, if it increases with the supply of domestic bonds and decreases with the supply of foreign bonds. In

both studies the relevant coefficients proved to be statistically insigni!cant.

A tentative suggestion is that the more likely candidate for the failure is not the existence of a risk premium

but, rather, non-rational expectations in the foreign exchange market. Indeed, Frankel and Froot (1987) suggest

that neither the rational expectations hypothesis nor alternative expectations hypotheses correctly specify

exchange market expectations, while preliminary research into this question by MacDonald and Torrance

(1989) and Taylor (1989) suggests that both the existence of a risk premium and non-rational expectations are

to blame. However, the success of papers such as Clarida and Taylor (1997) and Clarida et al. (2003) suggests

there may be information in the series of forward exchange rates that is useful for predicting the future path

- f the spot exchange rate, suggesting non-rational use of information.

9.6 EMPIRICAL TESTS OF EXCHANGE RATE MODELS

As we saw in Chapter 7, there are a variety of models of exchange rate determination for the authorities

to choose from, with radically di$erent implications for the conduct of exchange rate policy. In particular,

the monetary and portfolio balance models have very di$erent implications concerning the e$ectiveness of

sterilized intervention.

207

International Finance

Predictably, some authors have conducted empirical tests of their exchange rate model and found evidence

to support it, while others using either di$erent time periods or di$erent bilateral exchange rates have found

evidence against a given model. Another problem is that some authors have taken the empirical evidence

to support their exchange rate model when the same predictions are also made by rival theories. As we saw

in Chapter 7, in an attempt to overcome this latter problem, Frankel (1983, 1984) extended his monetary

synthesis equation (1979) to incorporate a portfolio balance e$etc. We repeat the synthesis equation (7.46)

below:

1 [�] 1 1� 1/ - � ( _m_ - _m_ *) - �1 1�/ - � ( _y_ - _y_ *) - 1 1���1/ /���

( _r_       - _r_ *)       - ( _b_       - _f_ )

- - 1/ - � - � - 1

Te fully flexible price monetarist version postulates that both the parameters 1 and * approach in!nity,

which reduces equation (9.12) to the flexible price monetary equation (7.9) of Chapter 7. Te sticky-price

monetarist school holds that 1 is less than in!nite, while * is in!nite, so we end up with the real interest

di$erential equation (7.31), whereas the sticky-price portfolio balance model holds that both the parameters

- and 1 are less than in!nite, so that relative bond supplies have an impact on the exchange rate. Te relevant
equation is therefore (7.46) or (9.12).

Equation (9.12) yields the following reduced-form regression for the exchange rate:

_s_        - _a_ 1        - _a_ 2        - _m_        - _m_ *�        - _a_ 3 ( _y_        - _y_ *)        - _a_ 4 ( _r_        - _r_ *)        - _a_ 5 ( _Pe_         - _Pe_  *)        - _a_ 6 ( _b_        - _f_ )        - _ut_ (9.13)

Table 9.3 reveals the conflicting predictions of the four main models of exchange rate determination derived

from equation (9.13).

Te Frankel formulation shows that the theoretical predictions of the main models of exchange rate

determination are sufficiently di$erent that a resort to empirical testing should allow us to discriminate

between the various theories. Frankel tests his synthesis equation for the US dollar against the Deutschmark

using monthly data for the period January 1974–October 1978. In a similar vein, Pilbeam (1991) tests the

Frankel equation for the US dollar against the pound for the period January 1973 to December 1984. Results

from these two studies are reported in Table 9.4.

Te results reported in Table 9.4 are typical examples of most exchange rate tests. As we can see from the

reported regressions, the results, rather than favouring any particular model of exchange rate determination,

are not favourable to any. In the Frankel study the only variable to be signi!cant is the equation for relative

bond supplies but this is of the wrong sign! In the Pilbeam study, the only variable to be signi!cant is the money

stock but this is a prediction common to all three models. Te coefficient for real output is correctly signed in

the Pilbeam study, but incorrectly signed in the Frankel study, and statistically insigni!cant in both. As for the

nominal interest rate di$erential and expected inflation di$erential, the actual estimated coefficients were not

signi!cantly di$erent from zero, revealing that there is no clear-cut empirical relation between interest rates

and price expectations for either the dollar–Deutschmark or the dollar–pound exchange rate. Te regression

coefficient for the portfolio balance parameter is wrongly signed in both studies.

9.7 EXCHANGE RATE MODELS: A FORECASTING ANALYSIS

From the regression coefficients reported in Table 9.4, it is not possible to rank any of the alternative theories

derived from the Frankel synthesis equation. Although the regression coefficients provide very little support

for any of the theories this does not rule out the possibility that one of the exchange rate models may prove

209

International Finance

useful for forecasting purposes. In two important papers, Meese and Rogo$ (1983a, 1983b) have tested the

forecasting accuracy of popular exchange rate models. Teir test procedures and results have been replicated

by Pilbeam (1991) for the dollar–pound exchange rate and it is the results of that study which are reported here.

Tree models are tested: the flexible-price monetary model, the real-interest-di$erential model and the

sticky-price portfolio balance model. For the purposes of forecasting the exchange rate, the three models are

tested by using the variables which are deemed to be of interest from the Frankel synthesis equation, regardless

- f whether the coefficients proved statistically signi!cant or not. Pilbeam tests the forecasting accuracy of the
models for the period 1979:1 to 1988:3 using a quarterly data set.

In order to forecast the one-period-ahead exchange rate, a rolling regression technique was used, which meant

re-estimating the regression coefficients for each period _t_ to forecast the exchange rate in time _t_ + 1. For example,

to forecast the 1979:1 exchange rate, a regression for the period 1973:1 to 1978:4 was undertaken using the

coefficients deemed to be relevant by a given theory; these estimated coefficients were then used to forecast the

1979:1 exchange rate. Next, to forecast the 1979:2 exchange rate the regression was redone using data from 1973:1

to 1979:1 to re-estimate the coefficients, and these new estimates were then used to forecast the 1979:2 period

exchange rate, and so on. For the purposes of forecasting the exchange rate in time _t_ + 1, the actual values of the

exogenous (right-hand side) variables in time _t +_ 1 were used. Tis latter point is important because it means

that forecasts for one period ahead will not be based on the wrong money supplies, interest rates, etc., so that any

forecasting error is due to the weakness of the models rather than inaccurate forecasting of the fundamentals.

It is important to emphasize that for the purposes of forecasting it was the regression estimates of coefficients

that were employed and that these rarely corresponded to the theoretical values. For instance, the fully flexible

monetarist model predicts that the coefficient _a_ 2 for the money stock will be unity, but in the regressions it

hovered between 0.2 and 0.55, while for the portfolio balance model the coefficient for relative bond supplies was

persistently wrongly signed. Te purpose of the exercise was to see if any of the three models could be empirically

useful devices to forecast the exchange rate. Meese and Rogo$ (1983b) used plausible theoretical coefficient

values as opposed to the estimated coefficients for forecasting purposes, but their results were largely the same

as using the above procedure which is the basis of their (1983a) study. Table 9.5 shows the forecast values of the

exchange rate of the three alternative models tested in the Pilbeam study and the actual exchange rate.

For the purposes of ranking the forecasting accuracy of the three models, a commonly used statistical

measure known as the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) criterion was used. Te RMSE criterion compares

the predicted exchange rate with the actual exchange rate using the following formula:

          - 1 _n_ ( _st i_           -           -           - _st i_           - )
## Mean-squared error(MSE) [�]

_n_

- 2

## [�] i �1

_st i_ - - - _s_

_s_

_t i_ 

_t i_ - - _t i_ 

_n_ _i_ - 1 _st i_ 

where _n_ is the number of forecasts, _s_ t+i* is the predicted exchange rate for period _t_ + i at time _t_ and _s_ t+i is the

actual exchange rate in period _t_ + _i_ .

Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) = !wwMSE

Te lower the RMSE, the better the forecasting capability of the model. Te results of the RMSE test for the

three alternative exchange rate models are given below, and these results are compared with the RMSE of a

simple random-walk model of the exchange rate, whereby the current exchange rate at time _t_ is used as the

forecast for the exchange rate in period _t_ + 1. In other words, a random-walk forecast involves a speculator

saying that the exchange rate forecast for one period's time (in this case three months) will be the same as it

is today. Anyone without any knowledge of economics can make a random-walk forecast simply by opening

the daily newspaper!

210

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

Flexible-price monetary model 0.0806

Real-interest-di$erential model 0.0882

Sticky-price portfolio model 0.0870

Random walk model 0.0769

Note that the above results are based on the values of the exchange rate listed in Table 9.5. Te reported results

are in line with those of Meese and Rogo$ (1983a, 1983b) in showing that a simple random-walk model has

a superior forecasting power than any of the popular models of exchange rate determination. Such a result is

quite devastating for professional forecasters who use sophisticated econometric models because it suggests

that anyone by opening a newspaper can on average outperform a sophisticated exchange rate model designed

by groups of professional forecasters (which leaves us with the puzzle of explaining those forecasters’ high

salaries). In addition to the poor RMSEs, Table 9.5 shows that none of the models does very well at forecasting

the exchange rate at the three-month horizon. In fact, in the Meese and Rogo$ studies, it is shown that it is

- nly at the 12-months plus horizon that exchange rate models start (in some instances) to outperform the
random-walk model. Te abysmal performance of the theories requires some explanation, which is attempted
in the next section.

9.8 EXPLAINING THE POOR RESULTS OF EXCHANGE RATE MODELS

In addition to the Meese and Rogo$ studies and the Pilbeam study, other researchers comparing existing

exchange rate models with varying degrees of econometric technicality have shown that exchange rate

models perform poorly empirically. (See for example, Frankel (1984) who tests his synthesis equation for

the Deutschmark, yen, pound, French franc and Canadian dollar against the US dollar; Backus (1984) who

concentrates on the Canadian–US dollar rates; Leventakis (1987) who concentrates on the Deutschmark–

US dollar; and Hacche and Townend (1981) who fail in their attempt to model sterling’s e$ective exchange

rate.) Although some authors such as MacDonald and Taylor (1993) have managed to beat the randomwalk model using a relatively sophisticated dynamic speci!cation of the monetary model for forecasting the

Deutschmark–dollar parity, they only manage to do so by a very small margin and their results could be timespeci!c and a result of the application of very sophisticated techniques. Overall, the empirical studies reveal

that the failure of existing exchange rate models is quite general.

In their paper, Engel and West (2005) have changed the research agenda. They argue that, rather than

looking for economic fundamentals to explain exchange rate fundamentals, a more fruitful avenue for

research is to see if exchange rate changes can predict the future path of economic fundamentals. Since the

foreign exchange market is forward looking then exchange rate changes today are likely to be conveyers of

information about the future path of economic fundamentals. Speci!cally they argue (p. 487) that:

if the models are good approximations and expectations reflect information about future fundamentals,

the exchange rate changes will likely be useful in forecasting these fundamentals. So these models

212

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

suggest that exchange rates Granger-cause the fundamentals. Using quarterly bilateral dollar exchange

rates, 1974–2001, for the dollar versus the currencies of the six other Group of Seven countries, we !nd

some evidence of such causality, especially for nominal variables.

Te authors report results that provide quite strong support for the hypothesis that exchange rate changes

predict the path of economic fundamentals (in statistical jargon, Granger-cause), rather than economic

fundamentals predicting the path of the exchange rate. As such, their results suggest the exchange rate is best

viewed as an asset price in which the exchange rate moves in advance of changes in economic fundamentals

and thus better predicts the course of those fundamentals, such as relative interest rates, relative money

supplies and relative growth rates.

No doubt one could engage in a data-mining exercise looking at particular subperiods, a variety of bilateral

exchange rates using di$erent estimation techniques, and present evidence (by excluding results that do not

support your model!) favouring a given theory. However, it is surely better to recognize that there is no clearcut empirical support for any given theory. Indeed, Cheung et al. (2005) have shown that di$erent models

have di$erent degrees of success at forecasting exchange rates at di$ering time horizons, but that no consistent

pattern emerges. They conclude (p. 1171): 'the results do not point to any given model/speci!cation as being

very successful. On the other hand, some models seem to do well at certain horizons, for certain criteria. And

indeed, it may be that one model will do well for one exchange rate and not for another'. Tis failure to account

satisfactorily for exchange rate behaviour does not mean that the exchange rate models are necessarily wrong;

rather it probably reflects the enormous econometric problems of modelling exchange rate behaviour. In

fact, the exchange rate theories provide many reasons as to why exchange rates will be difficult to model

empirically. Among the more important are:

 - Exchange rates are determined not simply by the stance of monetary policy, but depend in a complex
and as yet little understood manner upon the monetary/!scal policy mix and the interactions of these
macroeconomic policies between countries.

 Te theoretical literature on exchange rate determination, since the advent of floating exchange

rates, has made it abundantly clear that the current exchange rate depends not only upon the present

fundamentals, but also upon the expected future course of those fundamentals. For this reason, new

information which alters perceptions about the future course of these fundamental factors will have

an impact upon the current exchange rate. It is extremely difficult to identify and model changes in

new information and how they are discounted into the current exchange rate.

 - Another related problem has become known in the literature as the 'Finance Minister Problem' or 'Peso
Problem'. Even if we have a correct model of exchange rate determination and an event relevant to the
exchange rate is widely expected to occur at some time in the future (the appointment of a new !nance
minister or increase in the money supply) this will a$etc the current exchange rate. However, if the
expected event does not materialize (the !nance minister is not appointed or the money supply is not
increased) then the movements in the exchange rate will appear unrelated to the supposed underlying
determinants. Te model itself would not be wrong but the empirical test would not verify it.

 - Another closely related problem was illustrated in Box 9.1. Te dynamic path of the exchange rate
will be completely di$erent depending upon whether a given shock or policy disturbance has been
anticipated or unanticipated. As we shall see in section 9.8, while some empirical progress has been
made in identifying anticipated and unanticipated exchange rate movements, it has so far not been
possible to integrate accurately such e$ects into an empirically testable exchange rate model.

213

International Finance

 - All modern asset-market models of exchange rate determination are in agreement that expectations
are crucial to the determination of the current exchange rate. However, both in theory and when
it comes to the empirical test of a theory, the econometrics require that we adopt some major
simpli!cations. In the !rst instance, most theories assume that expectations are homogeneous when
in the real world they are clearly heterogeneous, as taking the predictions for the future spot exchange
rate from professional forecasters will testify. Also, when it comes to empirical implementation it
becomes necessary to adopt further radical simpli!cations. Some models assume perfect foresight

	- n the part of foreign exchange market participants, so that expectations are fully consistent with the
underlying theoretical model, while other models assume that exchange rate expectations are static

	- r follow a regressive expectations scheme. It is unlikely that any of these expectation mechanisms
properly speci!es the formation of expectations in an uncertain world (see section 9.10). Until we are
able more realistically to model exchange rate expectations we shall remain unable to satisfactorily
model exchange rate behaviour.

 - Another problem that may be particularly acute is that it has not only been changes in the supply of
money that have been important in explaining the exchange rate, but also instability in the demandfor-money schedules. Teoretically such shi,s are as important in determining the exchange rate as
changes in the money stock. In an attempt to study the problem of shi,s in money demand, Frankel
(1984) found that taking account of such shi,s could improve the performance of the monetary
model.

 - A particularly acute problem in attempts to model exchange rate behaviour since the advent of
floating rates is to incorporate into the empirical model the role of real shocks on exchange rate

movements.

 - A !nal problem worth mentioning and probably of considerable importance has been the enormous
changes in the !nancial and real structure of economies. Tese have had important implications for
the performance of economies and thereby on the exchange rate.

Tis list of reasons as to why it may prove empirically difficult to verify existing exchange rate models is rather

formidable. Te implication is that a given theory may be correct, but it may not pass an empirical test.

9.9 THE 'NEWS' APPROACH TO MODELLING EXCHANGE RATES

Although models of exchange rate determination measured in terms of levels have not proved particularly

successful, some success has been achieved with modelling exchange rate behaviour in a 'news' context. An

attractive feature of the news approach is that it combines the concept of exchange market efficiency with

modern models of exchange rate determination, and for this reason it is worth considering the approach in

some detail.

Authors such as Dornbusch (1980) and Frenkel (1982) have suggested that the correct way to model

_ex_

exchange rate movements is to presume that the foreign exchange market is efficient, in the sense that all

_ante_ pro!t opportunities are eliminated. Tis being the case, movements in exchange rates will be due to the

arrival of new information. As we shall see, the way that the two authors model news is somewhat di$erent,

but their results do provide some support for the news approach.

Te basic tenet of the news approach is that if the foreign exchange market is efficient then any di$erence

between the forward rate and the corresponding rate that later transpires must in an efficient market (with

214

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

no risk premium) be due to the arrival of new information. In other words, unanticipated exchange rate

movements are due to unexpected changes in the fundamentals. A typical speci!cation of a news model of

exchange rates is the following:

_st_                           - _ft t_ /                           - 1                           - _a_ 1                           - _a uX_ 2 _t_                           - _a uY_ 3 _t_                           - _a uZ_ 4 _t_                           - _ut_ (9.14)

where _s_ t is the log of the spot exchange rate at time _t_ ; _f_ t/t–1 is the log of the forward exchange rate for time _t_ at

time _t_ - 1; and _uX_ t, _uY_ t and _uZ_ t are the logs of unexpected changes in the fundamental variables _X_, _Y_ and _Z_ .

Te main problem for the news-type models is obtaining a proxy for the unexpected change in the

fundamentals (the right-hand side of equation (9.14)). While the actual change in the selected fundamentals

is known, the problem is to devise proxies for what was the expected change. By deducting from the actual

change in a variable the proxy for the expected change in that variable, we are le, with the unexpected

change.

In devising a proxy for the unexpected change in the exchange rate we can invoke the EMH. In other words,

the expected spot rate is given by the forward exchange rate in the previous period. Hence, by deducting from

the actual exchange rate the previous period's forward rate we have a proxy for the unexpected change in the

exchange rate.

As for the unexpected change in the fundamentals, one has !rstly to decide what the fundamental variables

_X_ t, _Y_ t and _Z_ t are. Tis choice will obviously be dependent upon the exchange rate model selected. Having

selected the model it is then necessary to devise the proxies for the unexpected change in the variables chosen.

Tere are several alternative methods for devising such proxies:

1. Use publicly available forecasts – this is the approach taken by Dornbusch (1980), who takes the

six-monthly forecasts of the OECD as broadly representative of informed opinion about expected

economic growth rates and current account balances. By deducting these forecasts from what

subsequently occurred, he obtains a proxy for the unexpected change in these variables.

2. Use regression analysis. We can take a fundamental variable _X_, make it a dependent variable and

produce a forecast of what _X_ will be in the next period on the basis of the expected values of its

supposed determinants. Tat is:

_Xt t_ /                    - 1                    - _a_ 1                    - _a L_ 2 _t t_ /                    - 1                    - _a M_ 3 _t t_ /                    - 1                    - _a N_ 4 _t t_ /                    - 1                    - …� _ut_

where _X_ t/t–1 is the forecast value for the fundamental variable _X_ t at time _t_    - 1, and _L_ t/t–1, _M_ t/t–1 and

_N_ t/t–1 are the expected values for the fundamental variables _L_, _M_ and _N_ for time _t_ at time _t_   - 1 that

are supposed to be useful for predicting variable _X_    - ne period ahead. Te above regression would

then yield a forecast (expected) value for _X_ t that could be deducted from the actual value to yield

the unexpected change. Tis method is not very popular because it depends on having a good

explanatory model for the variable _X_ . Tis is very rarely the case in economics.

3. Use a time series methodology known as autoregression. With this method the forecast value of

fundamental variable _X_ is determined purely by a regression of past values of _X_ . Tat is:

_X_ = _a_ + _a_ _X_ + _a_ _X_ + _a_ _X_ + … + _ut_

t/t–1 1 2 t–1 3 t–2 4 t–3

where _X_ t–1, _X_ t–2 and _X_ t–3 etc are increasingly previous values of the variable _X_ .

215

International Finance

Tis method is a fairly popular way of generating a forecast for the value of _X_ as one is e$ectively

extrapolating from the current and past values of _X_ in order to generate an expected value of _X_ .

In the Dornbusch (1980) and Frenkel (1982) studies that pioneered the news approach, the results were

found to be highly supportive. Generally, the unexpected changes in the fundamentals (that is, the news

items) were found to be signi!cant determinants of the unexpected change in the exchange rate and the

coefficients of the expected sign. However, the choice of fundamental variables in the studies was rather ad

hoc, not involving tests of formal exchange rate models.

In a test of the news version of the real-interest-di$erential model, Edwards (1982) runs the following

regression:

_s_ t               - _a f_ 1 t t/               - 1               - _a um_ 2(               - _um_ *)t               - _a uy_ 3(               - _uy_ *)t               - _a ui_ 4(               - _ui_ *)t               - _ut_

where _f_ t/t–1 is the one-period-ahead forward exchange rate at time _t_ - 1, _um_ is the log of unexpected change in

domestic money supply, _uy_ is the unexpected increase in domestic income and _ui_ is the unexpected change

in the domestic real interest rate. An asterisk denotes the corresponding unexpected change in the foreign

variable.

Te expected signs in the coefficients are: _a_ 1 = 1 as the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future

spot rate (that is, EMH); _a_ 2 is positive so that a relative unexpected rise in the domestic money supply leads to

an unexpected depreciation; _a_ 3 should be negative as an unexpected rise in relative domestic income leads to

an unexpected appreciation; _a_ 4 should be negative as an unexpected rise in domestic real interest should lead

to an unexpected appreciation. Te results of the Edwards study are reported in Table 9.6.

Tese results provide mixed support for the news approach. As can be seen, the unexpected money supply

coefficient is correctly signed and signi!cant for two of the currencies, while the coefficient for expected

- output is signi!cant but of the wrong sign! However, the unexpected change in the real-interest di$erential is
not statistically signi!cant.

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

Apart from the original Dornbusch and Frenkel studies, MacDonald (1983) tested a news-type model for six

currencies against the US dollar over the period 1972:Q1 to 1979:Q4. He found that monetary developments

are sometimes statistically important but occasionally with the wrong sign!

An interesting !nding by both Edwards (1983a, 1983b) and MacDonald (1983) is that in some regressions

past news (that is, lagged news terms) can have a signi!cant e$ect on the unexpected exchange rate change.

Such an e$etc is incompatible with the concept of exchange market efficiency. Edwards argues that this e$ect

may be due to a lag in the publication of data. MacDonald also !nds that lagged news terms can be statistically

signi!cant, even with a lag of up to four periods. Tis is something of a mystery because, while publication lags

may account for signi!cant one-period lags, it is difficult to rationalize two or three-period lags. In summary,

although some of the news items move exchange rates in the direction predicted, the results are not particularly

robust across di$erent currencies and the news items are sometimes statistically signi!cant but wrongly signed.

Furthermore, the fact that lagged news items can be signi!cant for more than one period does not tie in with

the concept of exchange market efficiency, although results using lagged news e$ects are not particularly robust.

In a detailed study, Ehrmann and Fratzcher (2005) examine the impact of news using daily data for the

dollar–Deutschmark (euro) for the period January 1993 to February 2003. They subtract the median money

market survey views of the likely announcement for a set of 25 macro variables (such as GDP growth, money

supply growth, inflation, unemployment, trade balance, retail sales and so on) from the actual announced

values to !nd the news element and !nd that they can successfully explain 73% of the direction of exchange

rate movements. In their study, they !nd that it is important to use real-time data when examining the impact

- f news, that is, data actually released at the time rather than vintage data – revised data is o,en released
months a,er the original data typically used in exchange rate studies. When they use vintage data they can

- nly successfully predict 60% of the direction of exchange rate movements. They also !nd that the impact of
news varies with market conditions; in particular, news has a greater impact in times when there is a high
degree of market uncertainty and when previous exchange rate volatility has been large. Teir study is not
entirely successful, however; while an unexpected tightening of US monetary policy, such as an unexpected
50 basis points rise in the Federal funds interest rate, leads to a 0.8% appreciation of the dollar, an unexpected
interest rate hike by the Bundesbank or European Central Bank did not seem to have a similar e$etc on the
Deutschmark/euro. One !nal point from the study is that while they !nd that the news approach is good at
explaining the direction of exchange rate movements, it tends to explain only around 40% of the magnitude

- f exchange rate movements that have actually occurred. Te authors hypothesize that this might be due to an
- verreaction on the part of market participants to news announcements.

Overall, the news approach which combines the concept of exchange market efficiency with conventional

exchange rate models has proved a relatively fruitful area for exchange rate research. Nonetheless, given that

the empirical evidence on exchange market efficiency and conventional exchange rate models both have little

empirical support, it is not surprising that the news approach which combines the two concepts has somewhat

mixed empirical support.

9.10 THE LONGER-RUN PREDICTABILITY OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS

Given the failure of models to successfully predict exchange rate movements in the short run, there has been

more emphasis in subsequent research on trying to predict exchange rate movements over the longer run. An

interesting paper in this respect is that of Mark (1995). Te basic approach taken by Mark is to run regressions

- f the following equation:

_s_ t+k– _s_ t = +k + *k ( _z_ t– _s_ t) + _u_ t+k  where _k_, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 (9.15)

217

International Finance

where _s_ t+k is the _k_ - step-ahead exchange rate forecast; _s_ t is the spot exchange rate; and _z_ t is a fundamental variable

signi!cant for exchange rate determination, for example _z_ t = [( _m_ t– _m_ t*) – ( ( _y_ t– _y_ t*)]. From the monetary

model, it should be noted that Mark imposes the restriction that the income elasticity of money demand (()

is equal to unity and _u_ t+k is a random error.

If the fundamental equation is useful at predicting exchange rates, then we would expect to !nd *k > 0 and

signi!cant, and that it should increase with the time horizon _k_ ; whereas if *k = 0 then there is mean reversion in

the exchange rate, which is unrelated to economic fundamentals. Note that lagged fundamentals are being used

to predict the future exchange rate which arises from the error correction mechanism methodology employed.

Mark estimates equation (9.15) using quarterly data for the period 1973:Q2 to 1991:Q4 for the Canadian dollar,

the Deutschmark, yen and Swiss franc against the dollar using 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 quarters ahead.

As shown in Table 9.7, the point estimates of *k are all positive and increase with time _k_ as does the

explanatory power of the regression reflected in the R [2] statistic. Except in the case of the Canadian dollar the

signi!cance of the estimates of *k improves with time. One negative result from the Mark study, however, is

that the estimated *k coefficients are not statistically di$erent from zero, although Mark argues that this may

be due mainly to the small sample size available. More positively, in a forecasting exercise Mark !nds that he

is able to beat a random-walk forecast using the Deutschmark, yen and Swiss franc at the four-year horizon

using the monetary model, though in the case of the Canadian dollar the random-walk model still wins

- ut. Overall, Mark's results seem to suggest that economic fundamentals and the monetary model contain
signi!cant information for the determination of the long-run exchange rate.

In a follow-up study, Mark and Sul (2001) using quarterly data for a panel of 19 countries for the period

1973:Q1 to 1997:Q1 !nd further support for the monetary model in the long run and suggest that it is better

than the use of PPP as a modelling device for the long-run exchange rate. They show that in an out-of-sample

forecasting exercise for 13 out of 18 currencies, the monetary model can (very marginally) improve forecasts

- f exchange rates at the one-period-ahead quarterly forecast horizon compared to a random-walk forecast. In

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

addition, the PPP model can also be shown very marginally to improve upon a random-walk forecast at the

quarterly investment horizon. At the 16-quarter investment horizon, the monetary model is able decisively to

beat the random walk for 17 of the 18 currencies, as does the PPP model. However, a word of caution is introduced

in the Mark and Sul study in that the beating of the random-walk forecast is valid when either the dollar or Swiss

franc are used as the _numeraire_ currency. If, instead, the Japanese yen is used as the _numeraire_ currency, the

random walk beats the monetary model at the quarterly investment horizon and, more importantly, even beats

both the monetary and PPP models, even at the 16-quarter horizon! Another note of caution is that Faust et al.

(2003) show that if one uses original released data (that is, data available at the time forecasts are made) rather

than fully revised data (which were not available to market participants at the time), their results undermine to

some extent Mark's (1995) study especially for the yen and Deutschmark parities against the dollar. They also

show that exchange rate forecasts are generally much better using real-time data than fully revised _ex post_ data

as has been done in virtually all exchange rate studies including the classic Meese and Rogo$ studies.

Further support for the monetary model as a long-run description of the data is provided by Groen (2000),

who tests the following exchange rate model using both cross-sectional data and pooled panel-data methods

(a mixture of time series and cross-sectional data) for a group of 14 countries for the period 1973:Q1 to

1994:Q4. Using either the dollar or the Deutschmark as the numeraire currency provides long-run support

for the monetary model. Using cross-sectional data, Groen estimates if the average exchange rate change 3 _st_ is

related to the average di$erential money ( ~~3~~ ~~_m_~~ _t_ ) supply growth rate and the average di$erential change in real

income (3 _yt_ ) as given by:

3 _st_ =* + *1( ~~3~~ ~~_m_~~ _t_ ~~)~~ + *2( ~~3~~ ~~_y_~~ _t_ ~~)~~ + _u_ t (9.16)

where the expected sign for the coefficients is *1 = 1 and *2 < 0.

Te results reported by Groen are quite favourable to the monetary model as a long-run description of the

data with the following two regressions as reported in Table 9.8.

As can be seen, the cross-sectional estimates show that as an average long-run description of the data for

the 14 currencies the monetary model seems to perform very well; the estimated *1 coefficient is signi!cant

and one cannot reject the hypothesis that it is equal to unity as predicted by the monetary model. Furthermore,

the income elasticity of money demand is negative and signi!cant as predicted by the model (although more

negative than the –1 predicted in many monetary models). In addition, using a more sophisticated pooled

panel data methodology, Groen obtains estimates of *1 = 0.664, *2 = –1.335 for the dollar and *1 = 0.923,

*2 = –1.832 for the Deutschmark. All this shows that the monetary model seems to have quite good long-run

predictive powers for explaining exchange rate movements.

In an interesting paper, Rapach and Wohar (2002) take a di$erent approach to Mark (1995) and test the

monetary model for 14 currencies against the US dollar. Tey test the validity of the monetary model using

very-long-run annual data covering the period 1880–1995 (in most cases). Teir results show considerable

support for the monetary model for France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, moderate support for Belgium,

Finland and Portugal, and only weak support for Switzerland. However, they fail to !nd support for Australia,

Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK. One problem with using relatively long periods of data is

that the test covers many di$erent exchange rate regimes, including the gold standard, the Bretton Woods

system and the period of floating. A key test in the paper is as follows:

St= * + *1( _m_ t– _m_ t*) + *2( _y_ t– _y_ t*) + _u_ t (9.17)

According to the monetary model then we would expect *1 = 1 and *2 = –1. A summary of the results for some

- f the currencies is shown in Table 9.9.

Other studies such as Kilian (1999) and Kilian and Taylor (2003) based on long-run regressions produce

more mixed results, though the latter study using a simple PPP-based model of fundamentals, that is, setting

_z_ t = _s_ t = ( _p_ t– _p_ t*) as in the Mark (1995) study and allowing for non-linearity in the data-generating process,

!nds strong evidence in favour of longer-term predictability of the nominal exchange rate, suggesting that

PPP is a valid long-run proposition. Kilian and Taylor (2003) argue that one reason for the failure of existing

exchange rate models is that they are based on linear relationships between macro-determinants and exchange

rates. Tis means that they may be missing important non-linear relationships between exchange rates and

macro-fundamentals. In particular, the long-run fundamentals are represented by PPP, and Kilian and Taylor

allow for a non-linear adjustment mechanism of exchange rate deviations from PPP to their PPP values. They

look at seven bilateral dollar parities using quarterly data, and while their forecasts fail to beat the random

walk in the short run they !nd that for six of the seven parities they are able to beat a random-walk forecast

at a time horizon of two to three years. However, they are unable to beat the random-walk model in periods

- f six months or less, suggesting that the Meese and Rogo$ (1983a, 1983b) results remain robust at the shortterm horizon. Indeed, they are unable to decisively refute the Meese and Rogo$ results in an out-of-sample
test at even longer-term horizons, although this is due in part to the low power of the statistical tests, given the
amount of forecasts that they are able to make.

It now seems that there is an accumulation of quite sophisticated econometric evidence that suggests that

_long-run_ exchange rates can in large part be modelled on the basis of economic fundamentals such as the

monetary model of exchange rate determination. Te evidence is somewhat mixed and the success of the

monetary model in the long run cannot yet be categorized as a 'stylized fact'. However, it is becoming a stylized

fact that economic fundamentals are proving better for both modelling and forecasting the long-run exchange

rate than the short-run exchange rate.

9.11 MODELLING EXCHANGE RATE EXPECTATIONS

Given the importance of future expected exchange rates for the current exchange rate, any satisfactory model

- f exchange rates must model exchange rate expectations. Te problem is that modelling economic agents'
expectations is an area of considerable controversy in economics. Tere are a variety of alternative but plausible
methods of modelling expectations, and in this section we briefly look at some of the popular hypotheses used
and summarize some of the empirical research in this area.

Tere are six plausible theoretical methods for modelling the expected future exchange rate: static

expectations, adaptive expectations, extrapolative expectations, regressive expectations, rational expectations

and perfect foresight!

_Static expectations_

Es = s

t+1/t t

Te expected exchange rate in one period's time ( _Es_ t+1/t) is equal to the current exchange rate ( _s_ t). In other

words, the average expectation is that the exchange rate will not change. Such an expectation could be

rationalized by assuming that economic agents consider that there is an equal probability of the exchange rate

appreciating or depreciating by a given percentage. In other words, if the current exchange rate is \$1.30/€1,

the exchange rate expected one year hence is also \$1.30/€1.

_Adaptive expectations_

_Es_ t                - 1/t                -                - _s_ t                - (1�                - ) _Es_ t t/                - 1 0                -                -                - 1

Te expected exchange rate in one period's time is equal to a weighted average of the current exchange rate

and the exchange rate that was expected to be the current exchange rate one period before ( _Es_ t/t–1). Tus, if

the current exchange rate exceeds the previously anticipated current exchange rate then agents will revise

221

International Finance

upwards their forecasts as compared to previous periods' forecasts. For instance, if the current dollar–euro

rate is \$1.30/€1, but one year previously agents had thought it would be \$1.20/€1, their forecast for the euro in

- ne year's time will be above \$1.20/€1 but below \$1.30/€1. How close it is to the current rate will depend on
the weight attached to the current exchange rate (the larger is +).

_Extrapolative expectations_

_Es_ t                  - 1/t                  - _s_ t                  - _m s_ ( t                  - _s_ t                  - 1) _m_                  - 0

Te expected exchange rate in one period's time is equal to the current exchange rate plus some multiple ( _m_ )

- f the change in the exchange rate during the preceding period. If the current exchange rate is \$1.30/€1 and
- ne year previously the euro stood at \$1.20/€1 (that is, the euro appreciated by \$0.10 over the previous year),
the expected exchange rate one year hence will be somewhere above \$1.30/€1. If _m_ is less than one it will be
between \$1.30/€1 and \$1.40/€1, while if _m_ is greater than 1 it will be above \$1.40/€1. In other words, if the
euro appreciated the previous year it is expected to appreciate in the forthcoming year.

_Regressive expectations_

_Es_ t                - 1/t                -                - _s_ t                - (1�                - ) *s 0                -                -                - 1

Te expected exchange rate in one period's time is a weighted function of the current exchange rate and

agents' estimate of the long-run equilibrium exchange rate (s*). If the current exchange rate is di$erent to

the long-run equilibrium exchange rate, the expected exchange rate in the next period will lie closer to the

equilibrium rate than the current exchange rate. For example, if the current exchange rate is \$1.30/€1 but

the underlying long-term equilibrium rate is believed to be \$1.20/€1, then the expected exchange rate one

year hence will lie between \$1.30/€1 and \$1.20/€1. In other words, the exchange rate is expected to converge

towards its long-run equilibrium exchange rate.

_Rational expectations_

_Es_ t                     - 1/t                     - _s_ t                     - 1                     - _u_ t                     - 1

Te expected exchange rate in the next period will on average equal the actual exchange rate ( _s_ t+1), although

it may deviate by a random error of _u_ t+1; the average of _u_ t+1 being zero. On average the exchange rate that

is expected to materialize is the exchange rate that actually does materialize. Te rational expectations

hypothesis is that, on average, over a number of time periods, economic agents do not systematically over

- r underpredict the exchange rate. They may make forecast errors but these mistakes consist of sometimes
- verpredicting the future exchange rate and sometimes underpredicting it.

_Perfect foresight_

_Es_ t                      - 1/t                      - _s_ t                      - 1

Te expected exchange rate in the next period is equal to the actual exchange rate that materializes.

Tis suggests that economic agents have a complete knowledge of the model underlying exchange rate

determination so that they do not make any errors concerning the future exchange rate.

222

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

_Which expectations hypothesis is best?_

All of the above expectations mechanisms have some degree of plausibility; however, the static expectation,

adaptive expectation and extrapolative expectation mechanisms are somewhat arbitrary because they state

that the future exchange rate can be predicted entirely on the basis of current and past values of the exchange

rate. As such, no attention is paid to other information that may be relevant to the future exchange rate, such

as domestic and foreign inflation rates, interest rates, !scal and monetary policy stance, and so on.

Te regressive expectations mechanism, rational expectations and perfect foresight models are from a

theoretical viewpoint much better suited to dealing with exchange rates because they all allow for economic

agents using a far wider set of information. Te regressive expectations mechanism requires that economic

agents form a view concerning the appropriate long-run equilibrium exchange rate, while the rational

expectations hypothesis suggests that, although agents do not always get the exact exchange rate right,

they nevertheless do not systematically get things wrong. Finally, the perfect foresight model implies that

economic agents actually have the correct model of exchange rate determination and thereby do not make

errors with regard to the future exchange rate. While this latter case may seem unrealistic, it does have

the major advantage that the exchange rate implications from models that employ perfect foresight are

purely due to the structure of the model itself and not because of an arbitrary speci!cation of exchange rate

expectations.

**Box 9.2 The scapegoat theory of exchange rates**

Bacchetta and Wincoop (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011) suggest a new scapegoat theory of exchange rate

determination that helps to explain the unstable relationship between economic fundamentals and the

exchange rate in the short to medium term. They argue that, while economic agents may have a good idea

concerning the long-run relationship between economic fundamentals, in the short to medium term

they are far less certain about the relationship. In the short to medium term, exchange rate movements

are driven by both changes in economic fundamentals and also by unobservable fundamental shocks.

In the short run, when the exchange rate moves in a manner contrary to what economic agents had

expected on the basis of their prior beliefs about the underlying structural relationships, economic

agents look for scapegoats that can account for the inconsistency. If the currency movement is driven by

some unobservable fundamental shock then it may be rational for agents to assign a greater weight to

  - ne or more of the fundamental variables, making it a scapegoat to explain the exchange rate movement.

According to Bacchetta and Wincoop a fundamental variable can become a scapegoat if the

shock to an unobservable economic fundamental is large, causing the exchange rate movement to

be unexplained and any particular observable fundamental variable to deviate substantially from its

equilibrium value. According to the scapegoat theory, when an exchange rate movement is driven by a

change in unobservables (such as large customer order flows) then it is rational (or 'rational confusion')

for agents to blame the movement on observable macroeconomic fundamentals that are deviating from

their long-run equilibrium values. If the theory holds, then it may help to explain the large degree of

instability in the short to medium term in the relationship between macroeconomic fundamentals and

exchange rate movements.

In an empirical test Fratzcher et al. (2015) !nd strong empirical support for the scapegoat theory. To

conduct their test the authors use monthly survey data for the period 2001–09 from 40 to 60 !nancial

market participants who were asked to rate on a quantitative scale of one to ten the importance of six

key variables (short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, economic growth, inflation, current

account and equity flows) as drivers of currency movements. As a proxy for unobservable changes in

economic fundamentals the authors use proprietary customer order flow data from one of the major

market participants, UBS bank. For advanced currencies the sum of order flows from hedge funds

and asset managers is taken as a proxy for unobservable fundamentals – the idea being that these are

sophisticated investors and that their demands for a currency reflect other determinants of exchange rate

movements. Teir empirical studies cover 12 currencies versus either the US dollar or the euro. To see if

the scapegoat theory works (SCA) they compare the performance of the scapegoat model against a basic

macromodel with constant parameters (CP) and against a second model that allows for time varying

parameters (TVP). As shown in Table 9.10 the addition of the scapegoat model considerably improves

the adjusted R [2] parameter compared to not using the scapegoat model for the major industrialized

currencies, with similar results holding for emerging market currencies:

As can be seen in Table 9.10, the time varying model scapegoat models outperform the constant

parameter model and its explanatory power is signi!cantly increased once one includes an allowance for the

scapegoat e$ect. In their paper, Fratzcher et al. (2015, p. 19) conclude that ‘the scapegoat model, especially

in its time-varying formulation, does very well in explaining exchange rate movements, outperforming

benchmark macro and order flow models that do not allow for scapegoat e$ects'. While there will need

to be further empirical tests to check the robustness of the scapegoat model, the results suggest that the

linkage between economic fundamentals and exchange rate movements in the short run may be somewhat

stronger than the earlier literature had concluded, once scapegoat e$ects are incorporated.

9.12 EMPIRICAL TESTS OF DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS MECHANISMS

Tere are great difficulties in modelling exchange rate expectations; in particular market expectations

concerning the expected future spot rate are not directly observable, and if one uses the forward rate as a

proxy then this constitutes a joint test of the rational expectations hypothesis and the non-existence of a risk

premium. Fortunately, sets of survey data concerning market participants' forecasts for the future exchange

rate do exist; such data sets are made up of forecasts from various market participants such as economists,

bankers, corporate treasurers, forecasting agencies, central bankers, investment managers and the like.

224

Empirical Evidence on Exchange Rates

Dominguez (1986), using Money Market Services data for the period 1983–85, rejects the REH for

modelling one-week, one-month and three-month expectations for all currencies studied. Frankel and Froot

(1987) use survey data to examine extrapolative, adaptive and regressive expectations mechanisms and !nd a

di$erence between short-run and long-run expectations. In particular, they !nd evidence that, for short-term

horizons of one week to one month, expectations tend to be extrapolative. However, in the longer run of 6 to

12 months they !nd expectations tend to be regressive with the exchange rate moving towards its long-run

value as proxied by PPP. They argue that this may reflect the fact that market participants use chartist and

technical analysis in the short run, whereas economic fundamentals are more widely used for longer-run

forecasting. However, Liu and Maddala (1992), using the cointegration technique, !nd that the REH cannot

be rejected at the one-week-ahead forecasting horizon, although they reject it at the one-month-plus time

horizon. Meanwhile, Allen and Taylor (1990) are unable to reject the null hypothesis of static expectations

for very-short-term forecasts. Finally, Cavaglia et al. (1994) reject the hypothesis of rational expectations and

indeed !nd some evidence that expectations are irrational.

In summary, the empirical evidence concerning which expectations mechanisms are best for modelling

exchange rate expectations is very mixed. Te most plausible story is that the appropriate expectations

mechanism is itself time-variant, with market participants sometimes having static expectations, sometimes

extrapolative expectations, sometimes regressive expectations, and so on. Te rational expectations

mechanism, while theoretically highly plausible, seems to be far from the complete story. Furthermore, it

must also be recognized that the studies tend to take the median forecast of various market participants'

forecasts for the purpose of empirical testing of the various expectation hypotheses; however, authors such

as MacDonald and Marsh (1996) have shown that there is usually a high degree of heterogeneity in market

participants' forecasts, suggesting that economic agents process information di$erently and that any individual

expectations hypothesis is unlikely to capture the actual diversity present in the marketplace.

9.13 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO MODELLING EXCHANGE RATES: THE ROLE OF

CHARTISTS AND FUNDAMENTALISTS

Partly due to the failure of existing exchange rate models to account satisfactorily for exchange rate behaviour,

a number of papers, such as Goodhart (1988), Allen and Taylor (1989), Frankel and Froot (1990), De Grauwe

and Vansanten (1990) and Pilbeam (1995), have started to analyse the role played by various groups in the

foreign exchange market. Two groups that have attracted an increasing amount of attention are the so-called

'chartists' and 'fundamentalists'.

Chartists claim to be able to predict successfully the future behaviour of a variable such as the exchange

rate merely by examining a variety of recent charts of the exchange rate. Chartists claim that certain patterns

- f behaviour repeat themselves and that, by detecting the relevant pattern in play, considerable success
can be had in predicting the future exchange rate. Many of the patterns are given names such as 'head and
shoulders', 'triple bottom', 'ascending triangle' and 'double top'; Feeny (1989) provides an excellent summary of
chartist methodology. Te important point about chartists is that the only information they require to predict
exchange rates is the recent past behaviour of the exchange rate itself; 'economic fundamentals', such as money
supplies, interest rates or the balance of payments position, are not required. Critics of chartists are inclined to
accuse them of 'having long rulers and small brains'.

Fundamentalists are economists who argue that the best way to predict the future course of exchange rates

is to look at the prospectives for underlying economic fundamentals such as future interest rates, balance

- f payments prospects, inflation rates and so forth. Te important thing about fundamentalists is that they

225

International Finance

believe that the foreign exchange market is efficient, so past behaviour of the exchange rate will be of little use

in predicting its course. What matters for the exchange rate is the prospective development of the economic

fundamentals.

Frankel and Froot (1990) argue that much exchange rate behaviour may be explained by the fact that at certain

times chartists have the upper hand in determining the exchange rate, while at other times the fundamentalists

have the upper hand. In periods of high uncertainty over the course of economic fundamentals, chartists tend

to be the predominant force in the exchange market; while at times when economic fundamentals strongly

point to a certain path for the exchange rate, the fundamentalists become the predominant force.

Tere are a wide range of views within both chartism and fundamentalism. Allen and Taylor (1989)

conducted a survey of the influence of chartism on the London Foreign Exchange Market and found that

chartism is widely used as an input for short-term forecasting, while fundamental analysis is mainly used for

longer-term forecasting. On each Tuesday during the period June 1988 to March 1989 they asked a sample

- f chartists for their exchange rate forecasts for the sterling–dollar, dollar–mark and dollar–yen for both one
week and one month ahead. It was noted that there was a tendency for chartists to underpredict a rise in the
exchange rate and overpredict in a falling market. Tis suggests that chartists' 'elasticity of expectations' is less
than unity – that is, a 1% rise (fall) in the exchange rate appears to induce a less than 1% expected rise (fall)
in the following period. However, one chartist codenamed 'Mr M' did manage consistently to outperform the
random-walk model. Allen and Taylor found that there were signi!cant di$erences in the forecasts between
individual chartists, and chartist forecasts were generally worse than a random-walk forecast. It seems that
chartists are just as bad as economists in forecasting exchange rates.

Given the variety of chartist and fundamental methods that could be used to forecast the exchange rate,

an obvious question arises as to which method is most pro!table. In a study of this issue, Pilbeam (1995),

using quarterly data from January 1973 to the end of 1994, conducted a study of the relative investment

performance of three groups of hypothetical traders: chartists, fundamentalists and simpletons. Te chartist

group was made up of three traders that come up with di$erent forecasts merely by using past movements of

the exchange rate to forecast the future exchange rate. Similarly, the fundamentalist group was made up of three

traders that use di$erent exchange rate models for forecasting the future exchange rate, namely the flexibleprice monetary model, the Frankel sticky-price monetary model and the portfolio balance model. Finally, a

group of three simpleton traders was introduced that merely uses simple trading rules when investing their

funds. For example, a 'foreign simpleton' places all his money into the foreign currency and leaves it there

to earn the foreign interest rate plus (less) any appreciation (depreciation) of the foreign currency; a 'highest

simpleton' places his funds into the currency that provided the highest return (interest rate and exchange

rate return) in the previous quarter; while, !nally, a 'random-walk simpleton' who believes the exchange rate

follows a random walk merely places his funds in the currency with the highest international interest rate

since he expects no gain to be made on average from exchange rate movements. Te key results from the

Pilbeam study are shown in Table 9.11, which comprises the respective group yields and standard deviations

derived by taking the average of the three traders associated with each group for the period 1974–94.

Te study shows that there is no clear-cut winner in terms of pro!tability and that one could not reject

the hypothesis that the annualized yields achieved by chartists, fundamentalists and simpletons were equal for

any of the individual parities or for the group currency averages. While there were statistical di$erences in the

variability of yields between the various groups, no robust pattern emerged. For instance, for the pound parity

the fundamentalists had a statistically signi!cant lower variability than the simpletons, while the reverse held for

the yen parity. Te clear result that emerges from the Pilbeam study is that at the quarterly investment horizon

there is no real di$erence between trading using past movements of the exchange rate or using economic

fundamentals; indeed, even naïve trading strategies seem to perform as well as trading on charts or fundamentals.

9.14 CONCLUSIONS

In contrast to the exciting advances in the theoretical modelling of exchange rates, empirical tests of these

theories have been notoriously unrewarding, especially at the short-term horizon. None of the major theories

stand up well to empirical examination. In large part, the empirical failure of the models reflects the enormous

econometric problems involved in modelling exchange rates. However, the use of more sophisticated

econometric techniques, while not greatly improving short-term modelling, has begun to suggest that there

are predictable long-run relationships between exchange rate movements and economic fundamentals.

Tere is quite a substantial amount of empirical evidence that rejects the joint test of exchange market

efficiency and no risk premium; that is, UIP in the short run. Tis is particularly damaging for the monetarist

models which assume both. Although the portfolio balance model allows for departures from UIP due to the

existence of a risk premium, there is little empirical evidence to support it as an alternative to the monetary

models. Attempts to explain the risk premium in terms of its theoretical underlying determinants have failed.

In summary, the possibility that the modern theories of exchange rate determination are very incomplete

explanations of shortto medium-term exchange rate movements cannot be ruled out. However, subsequent

work has suggested that some of the econometric rejections of UIP do not necessarily imply the ability to

make excess pro!ts over the medium to long term, suggesting that the foreign exchange market may still be

efficient.

On the other hand, empirical rejection of the models does not necessarily mean that they are wrong because

tests of exchange rate models do little justice to the complexities of the various theories. Tus, policy-makers

should not ignore the theories, though it may be unwise to base policy on any single theory. In this respect,

most theories emphasize the importance of pursuing stable monetary policies in order to avoid disruptive

exchange rate movements.

In all probability many of the major empirical issues concerning exchange rate determination in the

short to medium run are likely to remain unresolved in the foreseeable future, although some studies have

suggested better success in modelling long-run exchange rate behaviour. Research focusing on the role played

by di$erent groups such as chartists and fundamentalists in the determination of the exchange rate is yielding

new and useful insights. However, this approach is most unlikely to yield a signi!cant improvement in the

227

empirical modelling of shortand medium-term exchange rate behaviour. Te core of the problem lies in

the fact that all sides accept that expectations are crucial to the modelling of the exchange rate, but as we

have seen we currently have no satisfactory method of measuring these expectations. Until we can more

satisfactorily model expectations we shall be unable to satisfactorily model shortto medium-run exchange

rate behaviour.

10.1 INTRODUCTION

Prior to the move to generalized floating in 1973, the adoption of floating exchange rates had long been

advocated by eminent economists such as Milton Friedman (1953), Egon Sohmen (1961) and Harry Johnson

(1969). However, the experience with floating rates has not been the panacea that many advocates had

presupposed, and this has led many economists to propose schemes designed to limit exchange rate flexibility.

In this chapter, we will examine the traditional and more recent arguments for and against !xed and floating

exchange rates. We start by looking at the traditional debate over the two regimes, based upon evaluating

the arguments for and against each of the regimes. As we shall see, the traditional debate is inconclusive,

with floating rates having some advantages and disadvantages as compared to !xed exchange rates. Te

failure of the traditional debate stimulated an alternative method of evaluating these regimes based upon

comparing which regime best stabilizes the economy in the face of various shocks within the context of a

formal macroeconomic model. To give a flavour of the insights gained by this more modern approach we use

a simple macroeconomic model to evaluate the two regimes.

Although exchange rates have been allowed to float since 1973, authorities have frequently intervened in

the foreign exchange market in a bid to influence the exchange rate at which their currency is traded, hence

the term 'managed' floating. We will look at the economic rationale behind discretionary intervention in the

foreign exchange market. Te chapter also includes Box 10.1 which takes a brief look at an important strand

- f international economic literature known as optimal currency area theory, which attempts to !nd a set of
criteria for determining the optimal size of area for a single currency. Tis is a particularly important issue as
19 European countries have given up their national currencies for a single currency, the euro, and questions
arise as to how many countries the eurozone should encompass and what set of criteria economics can o$er
as to whether a country should be admitted to the currency.

International Finance

**Box 10.1 The optimum currency area literature**

Aside from the issue of !xed, floating and managed exchange rates, there is a branch of economic

literature that focuses on the issue of the relevant economic criteria for determining the optimum

economic area for a single currency unit. Put simply, an optimum currency area is a region for which it

is optimal to have a common currency and a common monetary policy. For example, the United States is

a vast economic area; is it optimal for it to have only a single currency unit for that area or would it make

more economic sense for it to have two currencies, one for the western part and one for the eastern part?

Te issue is particularly pertinent when it comes to the European Union that has moved from a situation

where 19 of its member countries with 19 di$erent currencies have formed the eurozone area which

has one currency, the euro, to serve those 19 countries. What is the optimum number of countries that

should join the euro and what criteria should be used to evaluate the suitability of a prospective member

for joining the euro? Indeed, is a single currency optimal only for one country, a group of countries or

all countries of the world? Determining a set of criteria to determine which countries should participate

in a monetary union has been the subject matter of optimal currency area theory. In the literature on

the subject there is no single set of criteria which is generally agreed upon, and for excellent surveys the

reader is referred to Tavlas (1993) and Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1994). Nonetheless, it is worthwhile

to review briefly some of the criteria that have been suggested for determining which countries should

join a monetary union:

   - **Degree of factor mobility internationally.** Mundell (1961) proposed that the higher the degree
	 - f factor mobility between countries, then the more bene!cial a monetary union would be
between them. Te rationale behind this criterion is that if a country is in a monetary union
and faces a fall in demand for its goods, which pushes its balance of payments into de!cit, high
capital mobility will enable it to !nance its de!cit more easily without the need for an exchange
rate depreciation. In addition, high labour mobility will mean that de!cit regions can deflate
their economies without fear of a large increase in unemployment since labour can migrate to

	 - ther countries within the union. Conversely, if factor mobility is low, then an exchange rate
depreciation is required to eliminate the de!cit and maintain employment levels, and hence a
monetary union would be undesirable.

   - **Degree of $nancial integration.** Tis is connected with the degree of factor mobility
mentioned above, but is speci!cally concerned with the ability of a country to gain access to
external !nance. If a country has a high degree of !nancial integration with other countries,
then it will be more able to !nance its de!cits and be less dependent on exchange rate
changes. A small variation in its interest rates will attract the necessary capital flows to !nance
imbalances. If countries are !nancially integrated then a single currency is a more feasible

	 - ption than in the absence of such integration.
   - **Degree of openness.** McKinnon (1963) has argued that the more open the economy, as
measured by the size of its tradables relative to its non-tradables sector, the more pro!table it
is to join a currency union. Te rationale is that if the economy has a large tradables sector it
will be much more vulnerable to inflation from a depreciating currency and unemployment
from an appreciating currency and therefore the less desirable the exchange rate changes will
be. Indeed, the more important that trade is for the country, the more potential it will have to

230

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

bene!t from the introduction of a single currency with its major trading partners. Also, the

more open the economy is, the higher are the adjustment costs associated with changes in the

exchange rate.

   - **Degree of product diversi$cation.** Kenen (1969) has suggested that the more diversi!ed
a country's range of exports and imports, the more it will bene!t from monetary union. A
diversi!ed economy means less variability in its export earnings and import expenditure and
more stability for its balance of payments. Accordingly, there will be less need to resort to
exchange rate changes. If, however, it has only a few export products it may experience much
greater variability in its export earnings and will be more dependent upon exchange rate
changes to maintain external equilibrium.

   - **Degree of similarity of inflation rates.** Te idea underlying this criterion is fairly
straightforward. If countries have similar inflation rates then PPP theory suggests that there is
no need for exchange rate changes and hence a monetary union is more feasible, whereas if the
countries have widely divergent propensities to inflate, then floating exchange rates become
necessary to ensure that the relatively high inflation countries maintain their international
competitiveness.

Even if we ignore numerous criticisms that can be made of the individual criteria – see the surveys by

Tower and Willett (1976), Ishiyama (1975) and Goodhart (1975, ch. 15) – it is clear that emphasizing

  - ne particular factor is hardly sufficient grounds for justifying monetary union. What happens if two
countries score well under one of the criteria and poorly on all the others? An index of the various
criteria might o$er a better solution, but there is plenty of scope for disagreement over the appropriate
weight to assign to each of the criteria and then the total index value that would justify membership

  - f a monetary union. Goodhart (1975) emphasized that the need for a high degree of social cohesion
appears to be a crucial determinant of the size of a single currency area in the real world rather than any
clear-cut economic criteria. In summary, the optimal currency area literature addresses an interesting
question but the various criteria that have been suggested are far from conclusive.

**10.2 THE CASE FOR FIXED EXCHANGE RATES**

Te case for !xed exchange rates usually has two sides to it: on the one hand there are some positive arguments

in its favour of !xed exchange rates; and on the other hand there are arguments against floating exchange

rates. One needs to be careful with this approach because arguments against floating exchange rates are not

necessarily arguments in favour of !xed rates: they may well constitute arguments for some degree of exchange

rate management rather than for !xed parities. In this spirit, let us consider both the positive arguments in

favour of !xed rates and the argument against floating rates.

_Fixed exchange rates promote international trade and investment_

Te proponents of !xed exchange rates argue that !xed parities provide the best environment for the conduct

- f international trade and investment. It is argued that, just as a single currency is the best means of promoting
economic activity at the national level, !xed exchange rates are the best means of promoting international

231

International Finance

trade and investment at the international level. Exchange rate fluctuations cause additional uncertainty and

risk in international economic transactions and inhibit the growth and development of such transactions.

_Fixed exchange rates provide discipline for macroeconomic policies_

An argument frequently put forward in favour of !xed exchange rates is that the commitment to a !xed

exchange rate regime provides a degree of discipline to domestic macroeconomic policy that is absent

if exchange rates are allowed to float. If the authorities are in a !xed rate regime, the pursuit of reckless

macroeconomic policies (such as excessive monetary growth) will lead to pressure for a devaluation of the

currency necessitating intervention by the authorities to defend their currency and a fall in their reserves. If

the pressures continue, the authorities would eventually have to devalue the currency which would be taken

as a sign by economic agents that the authorities have mismanaged the economy. Such an unpleasant scenario

should encourage governments to resist adopting unsound expansionary macroeconomic policies which

they are invariably tempted to undertake prior to elections and in their attempts to reconcile conflicting

demands.

_Fixed exchange rates promote international cooperation_

Another argument in favour of !xed exchange rates is that they necessitate a degree of international cooperation

and coordination between countries that is generally absent under floating exchange rates (see Chapter 14

for more on international policy coordination). Countries that agree to peg their exchange rates generally

have to agree on measures to be undertaken when the agreed exchange rate parity comes under pressure.

At a minimum, !xed exchange rates require an agreement to avoid conflicting exchange rate targets, ruling

- ut the dangers of competitive devaluation scenarios such as occurred in the 1930s. Te enhanced degree
- f international cooperation should bring bene!ts and lead to a more stable environment for the conduct of
international trade and investment.

_Speculation under floating rates is likely to be destabilizing_

Te major argument advanced against floating exchange rates is that they are likely to be characterized

by destabilizing private speculation, producing the 'wrong' exchange rate, that is, an exchange rate that is

suboptimal from the viewpoint of resource allocation. Tere are several ways in which private speculation can

bring about the wrong exchange rate. Some of the arguments depend on 'irrational' speculation, while others

depend upon uncertainty.

One example of irrational speculation frequently cited is that the foreign exchange market can be **too**

**risk-averse** . It o,en attaches too high a probability to the possibility of a depreciation of a 'weak' currency or,

equivalently, too high a probability to the possibility of an appreciation of a 'strong' currency, even when this is

not justi!ed by the fundamentals. Tat is, one currency, say the pound sterling, is regarded as 'too risky', while

another, say the US dollar, is regarded as 'safe' – market participants are basing their exchange rate forecasts

not only on currently available information but also on past performance. Te result is that there may be an

unjusti!ed reluctance to move out of dollars and to hold pounds, so that there is a larger depreciation of the

pound than is justi!ed by the fundamentals required as a premium by speculators to hold the pound. As a

result, the dollar becomes overvalued while the pound becomes undervalued. Te argument does not imply

that risk-aversion is an inefficient feature of the foreign exchange market, but rather that excessive risk-aversion

unjusti!ed by the fundamentals is. Instability of a country's economic policies may well create uncertainty and

232

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

therefore risk concerning estimates about the correct value of its currency. Excessive risk-aversion, however,

implies that part of the risk premium required by the market is unjusti!ed by the fundamentals.

Another case where irrational private speculation can produce the wrong rate is via the **'bandwagon'**

**effect** . Te idea is that there is too much self-generating speculation that is detached from the fundamentals:

'speculation feeding upon speculation' rather than the fundamentals. A possible scenario involving the

bandwagon e$ect is when some news hits the market, say an unexpected increase in the UK money supply,

which then sets o$ unjusti!ed speculation that the eventual rate of monetary growth will be even greater,

bringing with it an unduly pessimistic inflation forecast. Assuming that the rate of growth of the money

supply contained in the news turns out to be the actual rate, the depreciation of the pound will turn out to

have been greater than was justi!ed by the news and this will then reverse itself when it becomes evident that

a bandwagon e$etc has been in play.

Te excessive risk-aversion and bandwagon e$etc arguments presuppose that foreign exchange speculators

do not use all the information and news available to them efficiently, and consequently speculation produces

the wrong exchange rate until eventually fundamentals reassert themselves. Authors such as Dornbusch

(1983) have emphasized reasons as to why even rational speculators can produce the 'wrong' exchange rate.

Tese explanations are all based upon the concept of exchange rate uncertainty.

One reason why rational speculators may produce the wrong exchange rate is that in a world of

uncertainty they do not know the correct exchange rate model, and as such they use a **seriously defective**

**model** . Teir expectations based on the wrong (irrelevant) exchange rate model will then generally

lead to the wrong exchange rate. Tis point is important because market participants may be impressed

by a plausible but relatively unimportant fundamental variable and make their expectations based

upon movements in that variable come true. Furthermore, changes in irrelevant variables may lead to

signi!cant exchange rate movements. A further danger is that economic agents may shi, their attention

between many irrelevant pieces of information, causing excessive exchange rate variability and even major

exchange rate collapses.

Another reason why rational speculators may produce the wrong exchange rate is known as the **Peso**

**problem** . Exchange rates are determined not only by what is held to be the underlying fundamentals today,

but by what is expected to happen to those fundamentals in the future. Even if the speculators' model of the

underlying fundamentals is correct, their perceptions about the future can prove to be seriously wrong. In

such cases, the exchange rate moves immediately in anticipation of events that do not materialize. Such _ex_

_post_ unjusti!ed exchange rate movements can seriously interfere with the conduct of macroeconomic policy

and, with it, macroeconomic stability.

Blanchard (1979) proposed another reason for rational speculation producing the wrong rate, known as a

**rational bubble** . An exchange rate bubble exists when holders of a currency realize that it is overvalued but

are nevertheless willing to hold it, since they believe that the appreciation will continue for a while longer

and that there is only a limited risk of a serious depreciation during a given holding period. So speculators

expect to be able to sell eventually at an exchange rate that will provide them with a sufficient capital gain

to compensate them for running the risk of a sudden collapse. Such speculation both prolongs an exchange

- vervaluation and aggravates the macroeconomic costs associated with it.

Hence, there are a variety of arguments as to why private speculation may be destabilizing, and such

destabilizing speculation is o,en used as an argument for a !xed exchange rate and against a floating

exchange rate. However, we have to be extremely careful here because a !xed exchange rate can be !xed at

the wrong rate, just as a floating rate can float to a wrong rate. Even if a !xed exchange rate is initially !xed

at the optimal exchange rate, when the economic fundamentals change the !xed parity then becomes the

wrong rate.

233

International Finance

10.3 THE CASE FOR FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES

Te case for floating exchange rates is a mixture of positive arguments in favour of floating and arguments

against !xed exchange rates. Again, caution is warranted with the arguments against !xed exchange rates

because they do not necessarily constitute arguments for completely floating exchange rates.

_Floating exchange rates ensure balance of payments equilibrium_

Proponents of floating exchange rates argue that in a floating regime the exchange rate automatically adjusts to

ensure continuous equilibrium between the demand for and supply of the currency. If a country is running an

unsustainable current account de!cit, its exchange rate will depreciate which will reduce imports and increase

exports until the balance of payments is restored to a sustainable level. Conversely, a structural surplus in

the balance of payments will lead to an exchange rate appreciation that will reduce the surplus to sustainable

levels.

In other words, floating exchange rates ensure a balance between the demand for and supply of a currency:

excess demand leads to an appreciation, whereas excess supply leads to a depreciation. Tis contrasts to the

scenario under !xed exchange rates where an overvalued rate leads to an excess supply and thereby a fall in

the authorities' reserves, while !xing it at an undervalued rate leads to excess demand and an increase in the

authorities' reserves. Even if by chance the authorities initially peg the exchange rate at the point where supply

equals demand, that rate will soon become inappropriate when a change in the economic fundamentals

a$ects the supply or demand for the currency. Exchange rate adjustments, by taking care of the balance of

payments de!cits, relieve the authorities of having to adopt unpopular alternatives such as deflation or resort

to protectionism which could even provoke a damaging trade war.

_Floating exchange rates ensure monetary autonomy_

One of the major arguments put forward in favour of floating exchange rates is that they enable each country to

- perate an independent monetary policy; that is, they restore **monetary autonomy** enabling each country to
determine its own inflation rate. Countries that prefer low inflation rates are free to adopt tight macroeconomic
policies and experience appreciating currencies, while countries that pursue expansionary macroeconomic
policies will su$er higher inflation and depreciating currencies. Tis contrasts with what happens under
!xed exchange rates where the need to have common inflation rates to maintain competitiveness constrains
countries to pursue similar monetary policies.

_Floating exchange rates insulate economies_

A further argument put forward in favour of floating exchange rates is that they can **insulate** the domestic

economy from foreign price shocks. If there is an increase in foreign prices under floating exchange rates,

provided the exchange rate moves roughly in line with PPP, the domestic currency would merely appreciate, so

preventing the country from importing foreign inflation. Tis contrasts to what happens under !xed exchange

rates where a foreign price rise makes the home economy over-competitive, leading to a balance of payments

surplus which necessitates purchases of the foreign currency with newly created domestic currency to peg the

exchange rate. Te increase in the domestic money supply leads to an accompanying rise in domestic prices,

thus ending the surplus. Hence, !xed exchange rates lead to the importing of foreign price inflation/deflation

(see Chapter 5).

234

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

_Floating exchange rates promote economic stability_

A forceful argument put forward by Friedman (1953) in favour of flexible exchange rates is that it is better

to let exchange rates adjust in response to shocks to the economy than !x the exchange rate and force the

adjustment onto other economic variables. He argued that floating exchange rates are more conducive to

economic stability. Te exchange rate is a variable which can easily rise or fall, whereas domestic prices tend

to be very difficult to reduce. Hence, if there is a loss of international competitiveness it is better to allow the

exchange rate (one price) to depreciate rather than maintain a !xed exchange rate and require deflationary

policies to restore international competitiveness. Since the domestic price level is resistant to downward

pressure, it may require quite severe deflationary policies with associated high unemployment to induce the

fall in domestic wages and prices necessary to restore international competitiveness.

_Private speculation is stabilizing_

Te advocates of floating exchange rates argue that private speculators are a stabilizing rather than

destabilizing force. It is in the interests of speculators to move the exchange rate to its fundamental economic

value. Speculators will attempt to buy the currency at a low value and sell it at a high value and in so doing

reduce the gap between the low and high values. Of course, occasionally speculators will make mistakes and

buy a currency which they think has depreciated sufficiently and !nd that it continues to depreciate – such

destabilizing speculation will involve losses. Tis being the case, there is every reason to suppose that private

speculators will move the exchange rate towards its fundamental equilibrium value.

Many of the preceding arguments advanced for and against the two regimes are extremely difficult if

not impossible to prove. No doubt there are elements of truth on both sides of the argument. Speculation

can at times be stabilizing and at other times may be destabilizing. Fixed exchange rates can provide a

stable framework for international trade but so too can floating rates by ensuring countries maintain their

international competitiveness. Economic policies can be more or less stable under a !xed exchange rate

regime as compared to a floating one.

Since the traditional advantages/disadvantages approach leaves plenty of scope for disagreement, this

has stimulated an alternative, more modern approach to evaluating the two regimes. In this approach, the

relative merits of the two regimes are evaluated within the context of a formal macroeconomic model. We

now look at the insights provided by this alternative approach by using a relatively simple macroeconomic

model.

10.4 THE MODERN EVALUATION OF FIXED AND FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES

Te modern exchange rate literature has attempted to evaluate the choice between !xed and flexible exchange

rates by seeing which regime best stabilizes the domestic economy in the face of various shocks to the

economy. Te exchange rate regime that provides the most stability to the domestic economy is deemed

to be the preferred regime. As we shall see, although more sophisticated, this literature does not provide

an unambiguous answer to the question of which is the best exchange rate regime. What it shows is that

the choice between the two regimes is crucially dependent upon a multiplicity of factors. In our model, we

highlight three of these factors: the speci!cation of the objective function of the authorities as between price

and output stability, the type of shock impinging upon the economy, and the structural parameters of the

economy.

235

International Finance

10.5 SPECIFICATION OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION

Tere are many factors that the authorities have to take into account when designing their policies. Most

importantly, they have to decide what are their objectives and the weight to be attached to each of them. For

simplicity we shall deal with an economy where the authorities have two objectives: price and output stability.

Te aim of the authorities is viewed as being the minimization of fluctuations of the price level ( _P_ ) and output

level ( _Y_ ) around their target values. Te authorities will wish to minimize the value of the following objective

function:

O( _P_, _Y_ ) = _w_ ( _Y_           - _Yn_ ) [2] + (1 – _w_ ) ( _P_           - _Pn_ ) [2] 0 4 _w_ 4 1

where _w_ is the relative weight attached to each of the two objectives in the overall objective function, _Yn_ is the

natural/target value for domestic real income and _Pn_ is the natural/target value for the domestic price level.

Te idea of incorporating a weighted objective function is that there may be a trade-o$ for the authorities

between income and price stability. Some authorities may attach a high weight to price stability, whereas others

may attach a high priority to income stability, and a weighted objective function allows for this possibility.

A value of _w_ = 1 means that the objective involves only domestic income stability, whereas if _w_ = 0 the sole

concern is with price stability.

10.6 THE MODEL

We now investigate the choice between !xed and flexible exchange rate regimes for an economy that is bu$eted

by various transitory shocks. Te fact that the shocks are assumed to be transitory, that is self-reversing,

means that the next period is an important assumption because it means that the economy is always expected

to return to its natural price ( _Pn_ ) and output level ( _Yn_ ). In terms of the model, it means some simple rules can

be made concerning expectations. If the exchange rate depreciates today it is expected to appreciate back to its

normal level in the next period. Similarly, if the price or output levels rise above their normal levels they will

be expected to go back to their normal levels in the next period. In the model that follows, we shall examine

the performance of !xed and floating exchange rate regimes in the face of three types of transitory shocks:

money demand, aggregate demand and aggregate supply. All variables except interest rates are expressed in

logarithms.

Te demand for the home country's money is a positive function of the aggregate price index, is a positive

function of real domestic income and is inversely related to the domestic nominal interest rate. Tat is:

_Md_ t = _Pi_ t + ( _Y_ t – 2 _r_ t + _Ut_ 1 (10.1)

where _Md_ t is the demand to hold money in the current period _t_, _Pi_ t is the currently observable aggregate price

index made up of a weighted average of the domestic and foreign price levels as set out in equation (10.1a),

_Y_ t is the real domestic income in period _t_, _r_ t is the domestic nominal interest rate in current period _t_ which is

a currently observable !nancial variable and _Ut_ 1 is a transitory money demand shock term with zero mean

and normal distribution.

Te idea of incorporating the aggregate price index in the demand for money function is derived from

the monetarist proposition that the demand to hold money is a demand for real balances related to the

purchasing power of money. Te aggregate price index is a weighted average of the domestic price level and

236

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

the domestic price of the imported foreign good, which is equal to the exchange rate times the price of the

foreign good. Tat is:

_Pi_ t = + _P_ t + (1 – +)( _s_ t + _P_ t*) 0 < + 4 1 (10.1a)

where + is the weight of the domestic good in the overall consumption basket, _s_ t is the exchange rate de!ned

as domestic currency per unit of foreign currency in the current period, _P_ t is the price of domestic good in the

current period and _P_ t* is the price of the imported foreign good in the foreign currency in the current period.

Te demand for domestic output is a positive function of the real exchange rate and inversely related to the

domestic real interest rate and a positive function of the natural level of income. Tat is:

_Yd_ t = 1 ( _s_ t + _P_ t* – _P_ t) – * ( _r_ t + _P_ t – _P_ t + 1/t) + 0 _Yn_ + _Ut_ 2 (10.2)

where _P_ t+1/t is the expected price level in one period's time given the information available in the current

period, _Yn_ is the natural level of output and _Ut_ 2 is a transitory aggregate demand shock term with zero mean

and normal distribution.

Te real exchange rate is given by the !rst bracketed expression; an appreciation of the exchange rate would

reduce the demand for the domestic good. Similarly, the real domestic interest rate is given by the second

bracketed expression and is equivalent to the nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of price inflation.

A rise in the real interest rate will act to reduce the current demand for the domestic good.

Te supply of domestic output depends upon the price at which producers are able to sell their output

relative to the wage rate that they must pay per unit of labour. Tat is:

_Ys_ t = 5 ( _P_ t – _W_ t) + _Ut_ 3 (10.3)

_Ys_ t = _Ys_ t( _L_ t)   where 6 _Ys_ t/6 _L_ t > 0 and 6 [2] _Ys_ t/ 6 [2] _L_ t < 0 (10.3a)

where _Ys_ t is the supply of the domestic good, _L_ t is labour input, and _Ut_ 3 is a transitory aggregate supply shock

term with zero mean and normal distribution.

Equation (10.3) states that if the price of the domestic good rises relative to the wage rate, domestic producers

will increase their output and employment levels as the real wage facing them falls; while equation (10.3a)

states that output is a positive function of labour input but is subject to the law of diminishing returns. It is

assumed that !nancial capital is perfectly mobile and that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes.

As a result, the UIP condition is assumed to hold continuously. Tat is:

_r_ t = _r_ t* + ( _s_ t+1/t – _s_ t) (10.4)

where _r_ t* is the foreign interest rate in the current period and _s_ t+1/t is the expected exchange rate in period _t_ %+%1

given the information available at time _t_ . Te expression ( _s_ t+1/t– _s_ t) gives the expected rate of depreciation of

the currency.

Te contracting arrangement that determines the setting of nominal wages is central to the behaviour of

the model. Te contracts have a duration of one period and establish a nominal base wage _W_ t. It is assumed

that the base wage _W_ t is set at the level required to generate an expected level of output at the natural level _Yn_,

which is also the target level of the authorities:

_W_ t = _W_ t* (10.5)

237

International Finance

where _W_ t* is the wage rate that will in the absence of any shocks to the economy lead to full employment at

the natural rate of output.

In order to close the model we require the simultaneous ful!lment of the following two equations: that

money demand in the current period ( _Md_ t) equals the current money supply ( _Ms_ t), and that current aggregate

supply equals current aggregate demand. Tat is:

_Ms_ t = _Md_ t (10.6)

_Ys_ t = _Yd_ t (10.7)

Under !xed exchange rates, perfect capital mobility means that the domestic interest rate equals the

foreign interest rate and the money supply is endogenously determined. On the other hand, under floating

exchange rates the money supply is exogenously determined and the domestic interest rate and exchange

rate are endogenously determined but tied together via the UIP condition. We now set out the model using a

diagrammatic exposition.

10.7 DETERMINING EQUILIBRIUM

We use for exposition purposes the aggregate supply and demand schedules de!ned by equations (10.2)

and (10.3) respectively, and also make use of the money market curve as set out by equation (10.1). Initial

equilibrium is found where all three schedules intersect, as shown in Figure 10.1.

Te aggregate demand schedule is given by _Yd_ and is derived from equation (10.2); it is downward-sloping

because a rise in the domestic price level leads to a fall in aggregate demand for the domestic good, _ceteris_

_paribus_, for two reasons. Firstly, by inducing a decline in net exports, and secondly, since any rise in the

domestic price level leads to a future expected return of the price to its target level, the expected rate of price

inflation will be negative, which raises the real interest rate. Te absolute slope of the _Yd_ schedule is given by

the reciprocal of the summation of the elasticities of aggregate demand with respect to the real exchange rate

and real interest rate, that is, 1/(1 + *).

_Md_ depicts the money demand schedule derived from equation (10.1) of the model; it also has a negative

slope because a rise in the domestic price level increases the demand for money, requiring a fall in real income

to maintain money demand equilibrium. Te absolute slope of the _Md_ schedule is given by the income

elasticity of money demand divided by the share of the domestic good in the aggregate price index, that is, (/+.

Te slope of the _Yd_ schedule may be flatter or steeper than the _Md_ schedule and this proves to be critical

when comparing !xed and floating exchange rates in the face of an aggregate supply shock. Te condition

for the _Yd_ schedule to be flatter than the _Md_ schedule is that ( (1 + *) > +. For most of the analysis we shall

assume that this condition is satis!ed. Obviously, it is more likely to be satis!ed the more open the economy

(that is, the smaller is +) and the greater the elasticity of the demand for the home good with respect to the

real exchange rate and real interest rate. However, in order to see the importance of the relative slopes, in the

case of an aggregate supply shock, both cases are examined.

Te aggregate supply curve has a positive slope since a rise in the domestic price level for a !xed nominal

wage reduces the real wage facing producers, encouraging them to take on more workers which results in

increased output. It has a positive slope given by 1/5.

Equilibrium of the system is determined by the simultaneous interaction of all three schedules through a

common point. In the absence of unanticipated disturbances to the economy, output is at its natural level _Yn_

and the price level at the natural level _Pn_ . In the analysis, we shall also assume that these are the optimal target

values of the authorities, so that the economy is initially in full equilibrium.

If the system is initially in full equilibrium, only unanticipated disturbances will cause the schedules to

shi, from their equilibrium levels, inducing corresponding adjustments in price and output. Under !xed

exchange rates the money stock adjusts passively to shi,s in the _Ys_ and _Yd_ schedules because the money stock

is endogenously determined, whereas under floating exchange rates the exchange rate and interest rate adjust

to equilibrate the system causing shi,s in both the _Md_ and _Yd_ schedules. For example, an appreciation of the

exchange rate shi,s the _Yd_ schedule to the le, due to a loss of competitiveness, with a resulting fall in exports,

as well as the fact that an appreciation leads to an expected future depreciation as the shocks impinging upon

the economy are known to be self-reversing. As a result, the domestic interest rate is forced up further to

maintain UIP, shi,ing the _Yd_ schedule to the le,. Te rise in the domestic interest rate, to the extent that the

demand for money is interest-elastic, lowers the demand for money which for a given money stock requires a

shi, to the right of the _Md_ schedule. We now compare the relative performance of !xed and floating exchange

rates in the face of various shocks to the economy.

10.8 MONEY DEMAND SHOCK

Suppose that there is an unanticipated rise in money demand, as depicted in Figure 10.2. Tis has the e$etc of

shi,ing the _Md_ schedule to the le,. It is assumed that there are no other shocks impinging upon the economy.

An increase in money demand causes a shi, to the le, of the money demand schedule from _Md_ 1 to _Md_ 2.

Under !xed exchange rates the excess demand for money will cause a tendency for the currency to appreciate.

As a result the authorities have to purchase the foreign currency in the foreign exchange market, which

expands the domestic money stock. Te purchases continue until the _Md_ 2 schedule shi,s back to _Md_ 1. Tus,

short-run equilibrium remains at point A under !xed exchange rates with no disturbance to either domestic

prices or domestic output. Tis means that !xed exchange rates prove optimal. In e$etc, all the authorities do

239

**Figure 10.2** Money demand shock

is increase the money stock in line with the increased demand to hold money so that there are no required

adjustments to price and output.

If we are in a floating exchange rate regime the appreciation of the exchange rate shi,s _Yd_ 1 to the le, to

_Yd_ 2 due to the fall o$ in export demand and rise in the domestic interest rate as there is an expected future

depreciation of the currency. Te rise in the interest rate leads to a fall o$ in money demand, shi,ing _Md_ 2 to

_Md_ 3. Temporary equilibrium is attained where all three schedules intersect at point C. Tus, it can be seen

that under floating exchange rates a rise in the demand to hold money leads to a fall in both the domestic price

and output level. From this, it is obvious that, whether the principal objective is price or output stabilization,

!xed exchange rates are preferable for dealing with monetary shocks and in fact prove optimal.

10.9 AGGREGATE DEMAND SHOCK

Assume that there is an unanticipated increase in aggregate demand, as depicted in Figure 10.3. Tis has the

e$etc of shi,ing the _Yd_ schedule to the right.

An increase in aggregate demand shi,s _Yd_ 1 to _Yd_ 2. Tis means that there is an excess demand for money

which will cause the exchange rate to appreciate. As a result, the authorities have to intervene in the foreign

exchange market to purchase the foreign money with newly created domestic money so that _Md_ 1 shi,s to

_Md_ 2 and the excess money demand is eliminated. Tus, under !xed exchange rates short-run equilibrium is

found at point B with rises in both the domestic price and output level to _P_ 2 and _Y_ 2 respectively.

If, however, the authorities allow the exchange rate to float, the excess demand for money will result in an

appreciation of the domestic currency which will have two e$ects: the aggregate demand schedule will shi, to

the le, from _Yd_ 2 to _Yd_ 3 due to the fall o$ in exports, and the money demand schedule will shi, to the right

from _Md_ 1 to _Md_ 3 due to the rise in the domestic interest rate. Equilibrium of the system is obtained at point

C with price _P_ 3 and output _Y_ 3.

From this, it is evident that in the case of an aggregate demand disturbance, whether the objective of the

authorities is price or output stability, floating exchange rates outperform !xed rates.

10.10 AGGREGATE SUPPLY SHOCK

Assume that there is an unanticipated fall in aggregate supply. Tis has the e$etc of shi,ing the aggregate

supply schedule to the le,. Here it is necessary to distinguish two cases: in case 1 the _Md_ schedule is steeper

than the _Yd_ schedule, while in case 2 the _Yd_ schedule is steeper than the _Md_ schedule.

Te economy is initially in equilibrium at point A in Figure 10.4 with price _Pn_ and output _Yn_ . Te economy

is then hit by a transitory inflationary supply shock which shi,s _Ys_ 1 to _Ys_ 2. In this case, point B corresponds

to a position of excess supply of money, hence there is a tendency for the currency to depreciate. In order to

maintain a !xed exchange rate the authorities have to contract the money supply until the excess supply is

eliminated, so the _Md_ schedule shi,s from _Md_ 1 to M _d_ 2. Tus, under !xed exchange rates the inflationary

supply shock leads to a rise in price to _P_ 2 and a fall in output to _Y_ 2.

If, however, the authorities allow the exchange rate to float, the excess supply of money resulting from

the aggregate supply shock will lead to a depreciation of the currency. Te depreciation shi,s the aggregate

demand schedule to the right from _Yd_ 1 to _Yd_ 2 since it results in increased export sales of the domestic good.

Furthermore, the depreciation leads to an expected appreciation and therefore a fall in the domestic interest

rate which leads to an increased demand to hold money which shi,s the money demand schedule from _Md_ 1

to _Md_ 3. Equilibrium of the system under floating exchange rates is therefore obtained at point C with a rise in

price to _P_ 3 and a fall in output to _Y_ 3.

From this, we notice that our evaluation of the choice between !xed and floating exchange rate regimes

would depend primarily upon the objectives of the authorities. Tis is because !xed exchange rates favour

price stability while floating exchange rates favour income stability. Clearly, if the objective function of

the authorities is biased towards price stability, they would !nd !xed rates preferable to floating ones. If,

however, the authorities are more concerned with output stability, they would !nd floating rates preferable

to !xed ones. Tis is a good illustration of the importance of the speci!cation of the objective function:

depending upon the weighting of the objective function, either !xed or floating exchange rates could be

deemed superior.

In Figure 10.5 we again assume that there is a transitory inflationary aggregate supply shock that shi,s the

aggregate supply function from _Ys_ 1 to _Ys_ 2; this time, however, the money demand schedule is less steep than

the aggregate demand schedule.

In this case, the aggregate supply shock under !xed exchange rates causes there to be an excess demand

for money at point B, and consequently there is a tendency for the currency to appreciate. In order to avoid

an appreciation of the currency the authorities intervene in the foreign exchange market to purchase the

foreign currency, resulting in an increase in the domestic money stock until the _Md_ schedule shi,s from

_Md_ 1 to _Md_ 2. Te end result under !xed exchange rates is that the domestic price level rises to _P_ 2 and output

falls to _Y_ 2.

Under floating exchange rates, the excess demand for money resulting from the shock leads to an

appreciation of the exchange rate. Tis has the e$etc of shi,ing the aggregate demand schedule to the le, from

_Yd_ 1 to _Yd_ 2. In addition, the appreciation leads to the expectation of a future depreciation which, via the UIP

condition, raises the domestic interest rate, constituting an additional reason for the le,ward shi, of the _Yd_

schedule. Te rise in the domestic interest rate by reducing the demand for money shi,s the _Md_ schedule to

the right from _Md_ 1 to _Md_ 3. Te result is that short-run equilibrium under floating exchange rates is obtained

at point C with a rise in the domestic price level to _P_ 3 and a fall in domestic output to _Y_ 3.

In this case, we again observe a conflict when choosing between !xed and floating exchange rates. Te

di$erence is that in this instance !xed exchange rates favour output stability while floating exchange rates

favour price stability.

Te point of including this second case is that it illustrates the point that the choice between !xed and

floating exchange rates is very closely related to the structural parameters of the economy. In the !rst case,

greater output stability could be obtained by floating exchange rates, while in the second case !xed exchange

rates prove superior. From this, it follows that any policy recommendations should be based on a study of the

characteristics of the particular economy. Even if economies have similar objectives and face similar shocks

we may be led to make di$erent policy recommendations due to structural di$erences between economies.

Te results of the analysis of our model are summarized in Table 10.1.

Table 10.1 reveals that the choice between !xed and floating exchange rates is nowhere near as clear-cut as

their advocates are prone to argue. Te choice between the two regimes is seen to depend crucially upon the

type of shock impinging upon the economy, the objectives of the authorities and the structural parameters of

the particular economy considered (the steepness of the _Md_ schedule relative to the _Yd_ schedule).

Before concluding this section it is worth reminding readers that the model set out is extremely simple. In

practice, the choice between a !xed or floating exchange rate will be more complex. We have considered only

the case of transitory shocks, but economies are subjected to both transitory and permanent disturbances.

In addition, some economies have wage indexation, while others do not – indexation will lead to wage

adjustments following movements in the domestic price level or the exchange rate, which can alter the ranking

- f the two regimes (see Pilbeam, 1991). Finally, we have not touched upon the problem of interdependence:
while a !xed exchange rate may be the preferred choice for one economy, its trading partners may prefer a
floating regime. If this is the case, the appropriate exchange rate regime for the two countries is clearly greatly
complicated.

10.11 MANAGED FLOATING

Since the advent of floating exchange rates in 1973 it has become evident that authorities have not always let

their currency float freely but rather they have frequently intervened to influence it. A number of rationales

have been put forward to justify such intervention and are worth consideration.

Before examining some of the most frequently used arguments for intervention it is necessary to assume

that the authorities can influence the nominal and/or real exchange rate in their desired direction – without

such an assumption no rationale for intervention can exist. Further, when assessing the validity of intervention

policy it is necessary to compare exchange market intervention with alternative policies. Only if it can be

demonstrated that intervention has a superior bene!t to cost impact than other policies, or that constraints

prevent the use of superior policies, can exchange market intervention be justi!ed. It should be remembered

throughout that exchange rate management by the authorities can vary in degree from occasional intervention

to influencing the exchange rate to a permanent pegging.

Te arguments for some degree of discretionary intervention to some extent overlap, but fall into three

main categories: (i) the authorities can choose an exchange rate more in line with economic fundamentals

than the market; (ii) intervention is required to mitigate the costs of exchange rate 'overshooting'; and (iii)

intervention is an appropriate instrument for smoothing necessary economic adjustments.

_Authorities might be able to produce a more appropriate exchange rate_

As we argued in section 10.2, for a variety of reasons the exchange rate produced by the market may be the

wrong rate compared to underlying economic fundamentals. Te market may use the wrong model, it may

have the wrong perception about the future and it will have difficulty in interpreting the implications of

news relevant to the exchange rate. However, the fact that the market may produce the wrong rate does not

justify intervention by the authorities: it is necessary to demonstrate that the authorities can choose a more

appropriate rate.

Tere exists a case for intervention if the news or information available to the market is efficiently used but

the news itself is either inadequate – increasing risk – or misleading, and the authorities are in possession of

superior relevant information. Intervention in such circumstances can prove both stabilizing and pro!table.

However, it could be argued that a superior policy is for the authorities to abstain from intervention and

release the relevant information to the market. Nevertheless, there may be circumstances under which such

an information-release is not considered desirable, and even if the authorities were to release the relevant

information to the market, there is no guarantee that the market would believe them.

244

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

Connected with the above argument is a far more convincing reason for the authorities to intervene. While

it may be the case that the authorities do not know any more than the market regarding what is the correct rate,

they should know better and sooner what they themselves are about to do (in most cases!). Since the exchange

rate is an asset price, it incorporates expectations concerning its future price appropriately discounted into the

current price so that unusual _ex ante_ speculative pro!ts cannot be made. For example, if the money supply

is expected to increase at a given date in the future, this implies a depreciation of the exchange rate; if the

exchange rate did not depreciate until the expected increase in the money supply took place, this would imply

a large discrete depreciation of the exchange rate at that time. However, since the depreciation was expected

such a discrete jump would imply a missed abnormal _ex ante_ pro!t opportunity. Since the foreign exchange

market is efficient, the expectation of a depreciation leads to a smaller discrete depreciation of the current rate

(reflecting the news of future monetary expansion), with a gradual depreciation therea,er until the actual

increase in the money supply takes place. In this way all anticipated disturbances are fully discounted and

therefore unusual _ex ante_ pro!t opportunities eliminated.

Te point is that the authorities should be more capable than the market in predicting the future course

- f their policies, and this is of relevance to the correct exchange rate. Given this, intervention in the foreign
exchange market may be interpreted by the market as a commitment by the authorities to adopt a given course

- f action; if this is the case, economic agents may more readily lend their support to the new policy, helping to
make it more e$ective and more speedily implemented than would otherwise be the case. Tus, there exists a
case for official intervention on the grounds that the authorities have a better knowledge of their future policy
intentions than private market participants. Official intervention in the foreign exchange market may literally
'buy credibility', convincing economic agents that the authorities intend to ful!l their stated domestic policy
targets by committing the assets of the central bank in support of its declared future policy. A key postulate of
the rational expectations literature is that the authorities will only be able to achieve their short-run inflation

- bjectives painlessly if economic agents are convinced that the authorities intend to carry out their stated
- bjectives. Te opportunity to purchase some credibility by intervening in the foreign exchange market could
prove to be a useful policy tool.

To illustrate the above point, consider the case where there is news of an increase in the rate of growth of

the money supply. Tis may be viewed as a$ecting speculators’ expectations in at least three possible ways: it

may be seen as only a transitory development of a countercyclical nature that will subsequently be reversed;

it may be seen as a once and for all change in the money stock that will not be reversed but which will

not a$etc the underlying rate of growth of the money stock; or alternatively it may be seen as heralding a

more permanent increase in the rate of growth of the money stock. Each of the alternatives has di$erent

implications concerning the required depreciation of the currency: the greater the actual growth the greater

the required depreciation. Tere is no a priori reason to believe that the market, in the short run at least, will

- n balance know what is the required depreciation; the authorities, however, should know and could indicate
their feelings regarding the appropriate rate via an intervention policy.

_Intervention needed to mitigate costs of exchange rate overshooting_

Te Dornbusch (1976) overshooting model examined in Chapter 7 showed that a move to monetary restraint

can lead to a short-run real exchange rate appreciation, while an expansionary monetary policy can lead to

a real depreciation. Tese real exchange rate movements (overand undervaluations in relation to PPP) will

exert e$ects on the real economy. In what follows we shall refer to substantial and prolonged deviations from

PPP as exchange rate misalignments.

245

International Finance

Misaligned exchange rates distort the allocation of resources between tradables and non-tradables as well

as consumption patterns between the two. Undervaluation by raising the domestic price level and placing

downward pressure on real wages may spark o$ inflationary pressures, while overvaluation by squeezing the

tradables sector may result in increased unemployment. Misalignment complicates and inhibits investment

decisions because uncertainty as to the duration of the over/undervaluation will a$etc the pro!tability

calculations concerning whether to invest in tradables or non-tradables, particularly inhibiting marginal

investment decisions.

Misalignments almost certainly exert a ratchet e$etc on protectionism. In periods of undervaluation of the

currency, resources that would ordinarily not be viable enter into the tradables sector but as the rate corrects

itself they will come under increasing pressure and will then seek recourse to protection. Alternatively, if

the currency is overvalued this will tend to lead to automatic protectionist cries due to the pressure on the

tradables sector. It should also be remembered that undervaluation for one currency involves overvaluation

for another and vice versa, so that one could expect protectionism to be a global and persistent phenomenon

so long as exchange rates are misaligned. Since an under/overvaluation must necessarily eventually be

corrected, which will involve various adjustment costs arising because of factor immobility, occupationally

and geographically, retraining of labour will involve costs and time, and absorption cannot be painlessly

varied at will.

Foreign exchange intervention designed to reduce the costs and extent of exchange rate overshooting

could be justi!ed. It is worth noting that the case for intervention in this instance is not in any way due to

inefficiency in the foreign exchange market. Te rate produced by the market is the correct rate but because

- f 'sticky' goods prices there are short-run real exchange rate changes. If the price level increased (decreased)
by _x_ % immediately following an _x_ % change in the money supply, as in the flexible price monetary model,
there would be no overshooting of the exchange rate. Tis latter observation has led some authors to propose
that rather than intervene in the foreign exchange market, the authorities should tackle the inefficiencies in
the goods and labour markets. If these markets were made more flexible so that the rate of inflation adjusted
quickly to changes in monetary policy, then this would reduce the amount of overshooting. Te measures
proposed would include anti-trust legislation, reductions in trade union power and the reduction of social
security bene!ts, all of which would make goods and factor prices more flexible and thereby reduce the
problem of overshooting. Not surprisingly, by comparison to the likely resistance and turmoil associated with
such policies, exchange market intervention can prove a superior policy tool.

_Intervention to smooth the economic adjustment process_

Tere may exist a rationale for the authorities to intervene in the foreign exchange market to achieve a

preferable exchange rate in the short run to permit a smoothing of the necessary adjustments that the

economy must for various reasons undergo. Te rationale for smoothing the adjustment process is that it

is a painful process for those who have to adjust and is more acceptable at a controlled pace than a marketdetermined pace.

Suppose that a country has a persistent balance of payments surplus because the traded goods sector is too

large relative to the non-traded sector. Tere will consequently be a tendency for an appreciation of the real

exchange rate which will encourage factors to move from the traded goods sector to the non-traded sector.

If the authorities are concerned about the possibility of large transitional unemployment resulting from

such an appreciation, they may try to moderate the appreciation to allow time for the traded goods sector to

contract and the non-tradables sector to expand, so as to avoid what they consider to be excessive transitional

unemployment costs. Corden (1982) has coined the phrase 'exchange rate protection' to describe an exchange

246

Fixed, Floating and Managed Exchange Rates

rate policy whereby a country protects its tradable goods sector relative to the non-tradables sector, by either

devaluing the real exchange rate, allowing the exchange rate to depreciate by more than it otherwise would, or

preventing an exchange rate appreciation that would otherwise take place.

Te preceding case is only one variant of the need to switch resources in the economy; another may occur

when the tradables sector itself is divided into 'booming' and 'lagging' sectors. Te booming sector will cause

the real exchange rate to have a tendency to appreciate, and in so doing will speed up the demise of the lagging

sector. In either of the two cases cited, the case for exchange rate protection is clearly linked to the speed at

which adjustment can take place, be it between the traded and non-traded sector or within the tradables

sector.

Exchange market intervention can compare favourably to other methods of protection for the purpose of

slowing down the necessary adjustment, such as tari$ protection. Tis is because exchange rate protection,

which involves influencing the real exchange rate and with it the accumulation of reserves, must necessarily be

a temporary method of protection, whereas tari$s and subsidies have a habit of becoming permanent features

and, because of their explicit protective nature, tend to invite retaliation. Nevertheless, it is difficult to say that

either form of protection is to be preferred, for while tari$s distort production patterns within the tradables

sector in favour of the lagging (protected) sector, exchange rate protection protects all tradables whether they

require assistance or not, and it could be argued that because it is a more widespread means of protection it is

more likely to invite retaliation.

Another rationale for intervention may exist if the economy is caught in a 'vicious circle'. Consider a

country experiencing for whatever reason a current account de!cit that it is trying to eliminate by permitting

the depreciation of its currency. If wages adjust fully and instantaneously to the increased domestic price

level implied by such a policy, and the authorities adopt an accommodating monetary policy to avoid

an increase in unemployment, the country will be back where it started. A further depreciation will be

necessary and via the same process this will again lead the country back to where it started; the country will

be caught in a vicious circle of depreciation, price rises, wage rises and then further depreciation. Under

such circumstances, intervention in the foreign exchange market may serve to slow down or even avoid the

spiral, allowing the authorities to adopt a more appropriate policy designed to bring about the necessary

reduction in real wages or to await productivity improvements in the economy which means that real wages

do not have to fall.

It should be noted, however, that the real issue behind the vicious-circle argument for intervention concerns

the e$ectiveness of di$erent policy instruments in bringing about the ultimate reduction in real wages that

is essential for adjustment (in the absence of productivity improvements), while minimizing the harmful

consequences for other macro-objectives, such as the maintenance of full employment and reasonable price

stability. Here one should recall Keynes' argument that price changes may prove a more acceptable method

- f reducing real wages because they hit the labour force more or less equally, and by so doing do not upset to
any great extent wage di$erentials. Te alternative policy of deflation may prove a more painful process for
reducing real wages, especially with regard to the employment objective because it may require a large rise in
unemployment before the principle of real wage cuts becomes accepted by the labour force. Tus, there may
be a case in the vicious-circle argument for government intervention to slow down the rate of depreciation so
that real wages are reduced only gradually at a more acceptable pace.

Before concluding this section, it is worth emphasizing that the adjustment arguments advanced for

exchange rate management involve smoothing the adjustment process, not preventing it. Ideally, the exchange

rate should be allowed to adjust towards its equilibrium rate at an optimum pace, the determination of which

is clearly a policy problem. It is the acceptance of the principle of exchange rate adjustment that ensures that

the required changes in the economy do take place.

10.12 CONCLUSIONS

Te clear result that emerges from this chapter is that neither the traditional advantages/disadvantages

approach nor modern literature provide a clear-cut reason to prefer !xed exchange rates to floating ones or

vice versa. Fixed exchange rates have some advantages and disadvantages as compared to floating exchange

rates. Indeed, many of the proposed advantages can under some circumstances be viewed as disadvantages.

For example, floating exchange rates restore monetary autonomy, but whether this is a good or bad thing will

depend upon whether the authorities use the autonomy wisely.

Te modern approach to evaluating the two regimes shows that only under very speci!c conditions can

we say that one regime is better than the other. Our analysis has focused on three crucial factors which

determine the choice of exchange rate regime: the speci!cation of the objective function, the type of shock

impinging upon the economy, and the structure of the economy. In particular, the analysis highlights the

importance of the speci!cation of the objective function and demonstrates how a slight modi!cation to this

can completely reverse the ranking of the regimes. Di$erent countries, even if they have similar economic

structures and face similar shocks, may well require di$erent exchange rate regimes simply because their

- bjectives di$er.

Tere are a host of other factors that will complicate the choice of exchange rate regime, such as the

implications of wages indexation, the possibility of permanent shocks and the relationships between various

shocks. It should also be remembered that, in practice, it is extremely difficult to know if an economy is being

a7icted by a supply or demand shock or a shock to money demand. Even if a shock is identi!ed, there is the

question as to whether or not it is a permanent or transitory phenomenon.

Te lack of decisive arguments in favour of either !xed or floating exchange rates has frequently been

taken as a rationale for some degree of exchange rate management between the two regimes. Te argument

being that such exchange rate management has the potential to combine the advantages of both regimes,

while limiting the disadvantages. However, a demonstration that private speculation may produce the wrong

rate, or that exchange rates are prone to 'overshoot', does not by itself justify intervention. It is necessary to

demonstrate that the authorities can choose a more appropriate rate and that intervention can influence

the exchange rate in the desired direction. In addition, it is necessary to demonstrate that intervention

in%the%foreign exchange market is the best means of tackling the economic problem in hand. Instability of

the exchange rate may merely be due to unstable macroeconomic policies by the country concerned and

the%best means for reducing such fluctuations is to stabilize domestic economic policies, not intervention

in%the foreign exchange market.

Since there is no unique case for exchange rate management there can be no unique set of rules expected

to deal with the wide variety of circumstances that can arise. An appropriate intervention policy may involve

reducing or exacerbating exchange rate movements, intervention may need to be temporary or prolonged,

and the amount of intervention required will vary with the circumstances. In other words, even if intervention

can be justi!ed, the precise direction, duration and volume of intervention required need to be determined.

Finally, it should not be forgotten that we have examined the choice between alternative regimes within the

context of a particular model speci!cation of a small open economy. One of the implications of the analysis is

that di$erent countries may need to opt for di$erent exchange rate regimes. It may be the case that the choice

- f exchange rate policy by one country may well be a crucial factor in determining the choice of exchange rate
policy for other countries, and this is an issue that merits further research.

11.1 INTRODUCTION

!e international monetary system is broadly defined as the set of conventions, rules, procedures and

institutions that govern the conduct of financial relations between nations. In this chapter we look in some

detail at the development of the post-Second World War international monetary system. An understanding of

the historical, institutional and economic developments that have occurred since the end of the Second World

War are an essential background to the study of international finance. Many of the proposals for reform of the

international monetary system have been based upon the desire to avoid the problems and mistakes of the

past. !ere are many facets of the post-war system that merit attention and that are studied in this chapter.

Among these are the Bretton Woods system and its eventual breakdown, the move to $oating exchange rates,

International Finance

the economic events of the 1970s including two oil shocks, and the economic policy divergences of the 1980s.

!e setting-up of the European Monetary System (EMS), leading eventually to the achievement on 1 January

1999 of Economic and Monetary Union in Europe, is probably the most significant event to occur in the

evolution of the international monetary system since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.

!e 1990s witnessed considerable currency turmoil, which firstly a%icted developed economies with

speculative attacks launched against a number of EMS currencies including the British pound, the Italian

lira and the Spanish peseta. !e EMS crisis was followed by a series of currency and financial crises which

a%icted emerging market economies. In 1994–95 Mexico suffered what has become known as the 'tequila

crisis', but this proved to be merely a taster for the currency and financial turmoil that was to follow. In July

1997, a !ai baht devaluation marked an abrupt end to the 'Asian miracle' and the start of the 'Asian financial

crisis' which involved roughly one and a half years of unprecedented turbulence in the region's financial and

currency markets. Barely had the Asian crisis started to subside, when a new crisis broke out following an

effective Russian default on its domestic and foreign currency debts; the Russian crisis was accompanied

by concerns for the global capital markets when Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund

with massive speculative positions in the financial markets, was effectively bankrupted. !e Russian crisis

had a direct impact on Brazil which had its own currency crisis in 1999. !e new century started out with

its own set of crises, starting with a devaluation of the Turkish lira in 2001. !is was followed by the largest

ever default of \$100 billion of external debt by Argentina in January 2002 and the ending of its experiment

with a currency board system that had since 1991 pegged its currency at a one peso–one US dollar parity.

!e Argentinian crisis eventually impacted upon Uruguay which was forced to $oat its currency later in

the year.

Much of the story of the post-war international monetary order is about the central role of the US dollar

which, despite the birth of the euro, remains the major international currency. However, even the dollar has

been subjected to considerable turbulence in the foreign exchange markets in recent years: it appreciated

sharply and unexpectedly against the euro upon the latter's birth from \$1.174/&1 in January 1999 to \$0.827/&1

- n 26 October 2000, where it steadied before depreciating and then rallying back until 11 June 2001, when it
started to depreciate from \$0.843/&1 eventually reaching as low as \$1.58/&1 in March 2008. !is was caused by
mounting concerns about the size of the US current account deficits and cuts in US interest rates to historically
low levels by the Federal Reserve.

!e frequent currency crises and ever-increasing international capital movements have led some

commentators to argue that there is no room for a halfway house when it comes to the choice of exchange

rate regime. !ey have argued that the international monetary system will increasingly become bipolar with

countries adopting the extremes of either a 'hard peg' or a $oating exchange rate. !is view has recently been

challenged on empirical grounds and there have been a number of recent studies that attempt empirically

to examine the relative merits of fixed, $oating and intermediate exchange rate regimes on the basis of their

association with economic performance, which we shall review. We will conclude by examining some recent

and older proposals for reform of the international monetary system.

11.2 THE BRETTON WOODS SYSTEM

!e initial talks on reconstructing a post-war international monetary system started between the United

States and the United Kingdom as early as 1941. !e lead negotiators were Harry Dexter White for the USA

and John Maynard Keynes for the British. Given the US economic and political dominance at the end of the

war, it is not surprising that the eventual system re$ected more the US proposals. !e system that emerged

252

The International Monetary System

was ratified at an international monetary conference held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, attended by

some 44 countries, although some commentators dubbed the conference a meeting of one and a half nations

(the USA and the UK!).

!e motivation behind creating a new international monetary order was the desire to avoid the breakdown

in international monetary relations that had occurred in the 1930s. In the 1920s Germany witnessed

hyperin$ation and the US stock market collapse of 1929 heralded a worldwide recession. !e 1930s were

marked by major trade imbalances which in turn led to the adoption of widespread protectionism, the

adoption of de$ationary policies, competitive devaluations and the abandonment of the gold exchange

standard. In an in$uential report for the League of Nations, Ragnar Nurkse (1944) argued that experience

with $oating exchange rates had shown that they discouraged international trade, caused a misallocation of

resources and were generally characterized by bouts of destabilizing speculation.

11.3 FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM

!ere were several important features to the system: a fixed but adjustable exchange rate and the setting-up

- f two new international organizations. !ese were the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with the duty
- f monitoring and supervising the system, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD), commonly known as the World Bank, charged initially with the role of assisting the reconstruction of
Europe's devastated economies. In fact, the World Bank is a pair of institutions – the IBRD and the International
Development Association – which obtains money from developed nations and lends out the funds to the
poorest, less-developed countries (LDCs) at concessional terms. A third institution, the International Finance
Corporation, is a'liated to the World Bank and provides risk capital direct to the private sector of LDCs.

_Fixed but adjustable exchange rates_

Bretton Woods established a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates. Under the Articles of Agreement

- f the IMF, each currency was assigned a central parity against the US dollar and was allowed to $uctuate by
plus or minus 1% either side of this parity. !e dollar itself was fixed to the price of gold at \$35 per ounce.

!e idea of fixing the dollar to the price of gold was to provide confidence in the system. In 1945 the US

authorities held approximately 70% of the world's gold reserves. It was reasoned that foreign central banks

would be more willing to hold dollars in their reserves if they knew that they could be converted into gold. !e

US authorities made a commitment to keep the dollar convertible into gold at \$35 dollars per ounce, which

in effect was a pledge on the part of the USA to preserve the purchasing power of dollars, making the dollar

'as good as gold'.

A country was expected to preserve the par value of its currency vis-à-vis the dollar, but, in the case of a

'fundamental disequilibrium' in its balance of payments, it could devalue or revalue its currency. Providing the

proposed change was less than 10% the IMF could not object, but larger realignments required the permission

- f the Fund. !e ability of a country to alter its par rate as a last resort was seen as an essential part of the
system: it offered countries an ultimate alternative to de$ation or import controls as a means of correcting
persistent balance of payments imbalances.

Under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, the member governments committed themselves to making

their currencies convertible for current account transactions as soon as was feasible. Convertibility for current

account transactions meant that, while governments could still employ capital controls, they could not prevent

their residents or residents of other countries from buying or selling their currency for current account

253

International Finance

transactions. It is notable, however, that such a commitment to convertibility was not required with respect to

capital account transactions. !is omission re$ected the widespread suspicion that capital movements were

potentially highly destabilizing.

_The IMF and credit facilities_

!e IMF was set up with its general objective being to oversee and promote international monetary cooperation

and the growth of world trade. To these ends, one of the principal tasks of the Fund was to ensure the smooth

functioning of the fixed exchange rate system – in particular, minimizing the need for countries to devalue

and revalue their currencies by providing them with credit facilities with which to finance temporary balance

- f payments deficits.

One of the major problems envisaged with the fixed exchange rate system was that countries facing a

temporary balance of payments deficit would be forced to de$ate their economies if they wished to maintain

their exchange rate parity. As most governments had committed themselves to the maintenance of full

employment, such a scenario was not particularly appealing. To avert this, a credit mechanism was set up

to provide support for countries facing transitory balance of payments problems. Avoidance of de$ationary

policies was viewed as helpful in maintaining the volume of world trade.

Under the credit facility, each member of the IMF was allocated a quota, the size of the quota being related

to its economic importance as re$ected in the size of its subscription to the Fund. A country had to place

- ne-quarter of its quota in reserve assets (mainly gold) and the remaining three-quarters in its own currency
with the Fund. !is gave the IMF a stock of funds which could be lent to countries facing balance of payments
di'culties. A country facing di'culty could draw upon its quota should it need to do so. A country was
automatically entitled to the first 25% of its quota, known as its gold tranche, and a further four tranches

- f 25%, known as credit tranches, which could be drawn providing the country agreed to conditions set
by the IMF which became increasingly austere with each tranche that was drawn. !us, in total, a country
could draw a maximum of 125% of its quota. !e conditions attached to the latter tranches are known as
'IMF conditionality' and generally constitute a set of measures designed to improve a country's balance of
payments. !e IMF commenced operations in March 1947 with the total sum of initial quotas available at
\$8.8 billion.

When drawing upon the IMF resources, a member purchases reserve assets (usually dollars) in exchange

for further deposits of its currency. !e Fund decides what assets and currencies the drawing country receives

- n the basis of the composition of its own resources. As a rule, any borrowing from the Fund has to be repaid
- ver a period of three to five years. When repaying the Fund a country buys back its currency with foreign

reserves.

11.4 A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BRETTON WOODS SYSTEM

When the system of fixed parities commenced operation in March 1947 currencies were not freely convertible:

there were many restrictions on the amount of dollars that could be brought on the foreign exchange market

as most authorities had insu'cient reserves to meet the huge demand for dollars. In the immediate years a(er

the Second World War, the USA ran healthy current account surpluses and the European economies large

deficits. !is was partly because the Europeans did not have strong exporting capabilities and partly because

they were importing investment goods for reconstruction purposes and satisfying a pent-up consumer

demand.

254

The International Monetary System

!e setting-up of the Bretton Woods system did not provide the basis for the reconstruction of the

European countries _per se_ . One of the major problems confronting the Europeans was their lack of dollars

for purchasing the vital capital goods required to rebuild their war-torn economies. In 1948, partly out of a

desire to help the Europeans help themselves, the US Secretary of State George Marshall announced a massive

package of aid to the European economies. !e 'Marshall aid' package was a very significant contribution

to)European reconstruction and the development of the post-war world economy. Between mid-1948 and

mid-1952, Marshall aid provided some \$11.6 billion of grants and \$1.8 billion in loans and this greatly relieved

the problem of the dollar shortage. !e funds enabled European countries to purchase the capital and raw

materials necessary for reconstruction.

Marshall aid was made partly conditional on greater cooperation between the European economies.

One sign of this cooperation was the setting-up of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation

which)administered the Marshall aid funds; later this organization became the Organization for Economic

Co-operation and Development, with the USA and Canada joining in 1961 and Japan in 1964. Another

result of US encouragement to greater European cooperation was the European Payments Union (EPU),

which commenced operations in 1950. !e EPU enabled the European member countries to settle trade

credits among themselves with the minimal use of dollars. !is further relieved the dollar shortage

and) contributed to the faster liberalization and growth of intra-European trade as compared to extraEuropean trade.

In 1949 the European deficits led to a series of currency devaluations in the UK, France and the Scandinavian

countries, which received the approval of the IMF. !e Fund recognized that the parities that were fixed in 1944

- vervalued the European currencies and that to not allow the devaluations would require a severe de$ation in
the European economies which would be undesirable as they were seeking reconstruction. Furthermore, the
funds that the IMF had available for financing these deficits were considered to be inadequate and should not
be used to finance the reconstruction.

From the early 1950s onwards the US basic balance moved from its post-war surplus into deficits of

approximately \$1.5 billion per year. !e counterpart of this was that the Europeans and Japanese started to

run surpluses. Initially the US deficits caused no worries because its trading partners, notably West Germany

and Japan, were experiencing export-led growth and were happy to build up dollar reserves. So long as the

US deficits were of reasonable proportions and US gold reserves exceeded its dollar liabilities the system

functioned well. !e operation of the EPU, the Marshall aid package and the improved health of the European

economies in the 1950s enabled the Europeans to relax their trade and capital controls. In December 1958

the Europeans had acquired su'cient reserves that they were able to make their currencies convertible and

abolish the EPU.

During the period 1958–61 there was a more rapid deterioration in the US balance of payments (see

Table 11.1). Many of the dollars acquired were converted into gold by foreign central banks, and this gold

drain provoked some concern in the US administration about the US deficit. In March 1961 there was a 5%

revaluation of the Deutschmark and the Dutch guilder. In addition, to forestall speculation against the dollar,

the USA and nine other countries arranged a General Arrangement to Borrow (GAB). !e GAB members

who became known as the group of ten (G10) agreed to lend additional funds to the IMF should one of the

members require large-scale borrowing. !e GAB arrangements were opened in October 1962 with potential

lending commitments totalling \$6 billion. In the event the USA never used the facility which was not activated

until the UK used it at the end of 1964.

In 1954 the London gold bullion market reopened for private trading in gold. Around 1961, due to

speculation of a US devaluation against gold, there was persistent upward pressure on the price of gold.

Indeed, in 1962 there was such upward pressure on the gold price that the central banks of the USA and seven

- ther industrialized countries set up a 'gold pool'. !e purpose of the pool was to increase the supply of gold
- n the private market when there was an upward pressure on its price so as to keep it in line with the o'cial
price of \$35 per ounce.

In 1965, President de Gaulle made a speech extolling the virtues of gold as compared to the dollar, and the

French started to convert dollars into gold with the US authorities. By mid-1967 it was becoming apparent

that with US dollar liabilities exceeding its gold reserves, any attempt by central banks to convert their dollar

reserves into gold would lead to a breakdown of the system. !is led to an agreement by central banks not to

convert their dollar reserves into gold. In addition, the authorities decided to give up their sales of gold to the

private market in a bid to prevent its price rising. A two-tier market for gold was established with the o'cial

rate remaining at \$35 per ounce while the private market price was allowed to rise.

During the early 1960s the US balance of payments position stabilized but, by the mid-1960s, with US

involvement in the Vietnam War, the US balance of payments began to deteriorate more noticeably, as can be

seen in Table 11.1. !ere was a growing feeling that the dollar was overvalued in relation to other currencies.

!ings started coming to a head in 1967 when, a(er a series of current account deficits, the UK authorities

decided to devalue the pound by 14.6%. In 1969 problems with the French balance of payments and the

fall of de Gaulle led to an 11% devaluation of the franc and a 9.3% revaluation of the Deutschmark. !ese

devaluations reminded speculators that exchange rates were adjustable and that considerable profits could be

made in anticipating and selling currencies which would be devalued.

Little action was taken to reduce the size of the US balance of payments deficits which continued to rise.

By 1971 it became increasingly apparent to speculators that the dollar was overvalued and the Deutschmark

and yen were undervalued. In April 1971, the US trade balance went into deficit for the first time that century,

which led to a massive capital out$ow from the dollar in anticipation of a dollar devaluation. During May the

256

The International Monetary System

speculation against the dollar was so immense that the Bundesbank had to purchase some \$2 billion in just

two days. Speculation became so intense that foreign exchange trading was halted for a week. When trading

recommenced, the Deutschmark was revalued by 7% and the Austrian schilling by 5%.

!e revaluations were not considered to be su'cient, and with the private market price of gold exceeding

the o'cial price, speculators felt that a devaluation of the dollar was inevitable. Massive speculation against the

dollar continued with speculators buying yen and Deutschmarks in anticipation of quick short-term profits

from a dollar devaluation. With continued massive speculation against the dollar, on 15 August 1971 President

Nixon o'cially announced that the dollar was no longer convertible into gold. In addition, he announced an

emergency 10% tariff on all US imports as an interim measure until US trading partners agreed to revalue

their currencies against the dollar. Nixon also announced some domestic policies designed to stabilize the US

in$ation rate, which included price and wage controls.

!e motivation behind the Nixon measures was to prompt other countries to revalue their currencies

against the dollar; the US authorities did not feel that devaluing the dollar against gold was a desirable course

- f action. One reason was that the administration believed it would be a break of faith with foreign central
banks that had been persuaded to hold dollars rather than gold. Furthermore, a devaluation of the dollar
against gold would not improve US competitiveness if other countries continued to peg against the dollar. !e
hope was that the Nixon measures would encourage other countries to revalue their currencies against the
dollar and so restore US competitiveness.

!e immediate response of foreign governments to the Nixon measures was along the lines sought by

the US administration. Foreign governments allowed their exchange rates to $oat and agreed to a further

liberalization of trade barriers. In a bid to restore the pegged exchange rate system, the G10 nations met in

December at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. !ey tried to tackle the problem of the overvalued

dollar by devaluing it against gold from $35 to $38 and revaluing currencies against the dollar by an average

- f 8%. In addition, the margin by which other currencies could $uctuate against the dollar was widened
from ±1 to ±2.25%. In return for the revaluations, the USA agreed to remove its 10% import tariff. Although
President Nixon hailed the package as ‘the most significant monetary agreement in the history of the world’
it was in tatters within 15 months. !e devaluation and increased $exibility were really a case of too little
too late, especially as in$ation rate differentials between the industrialized countries began to diverge
(see Table)11.6). !e devaluation did little to remedy the US balance of payments which reached record
proportions in 1972.

By mid-1972 the UK ran into further balance of payments di'culties, and in June the UK authorities

decided to let the pound $oat. !e worsening US deficit led to further speculation against the dollar and

in January 1973 the Swiss authorities announced that the Swiss franc was to $oat against the dollar, soon

followed in February by the Japanese decision to allow the yen to $oat despite a further 10% dollar devaluation

- n 12 February. With further speculation against the dollar at the beginning of March, the foreign exchange
markets again had to be closed and when they reopened on 19 March the European currencies began a
joint $oat against the dollar known as the ‘Snake in the Tunnel’, an arrangement which meant that many
European currencies were allowed to $uctuate by a maximum of ±1.125% against one another (the Snake)
and a maximum of ±2.25% against the dollar (the Tunnel). In June 1973 the Snake in the Tunnel became the
plain Snake in which the maximum $uctuation against the dollar was abandoned.

!e adoption of $oating exchange rates stood in marked contrast to the setting-up of the Bretton Woods

system. !ere was no general agreement to adopt $oating exchange rates or what rules should govern the

conduct of future exchange rate policies. Rather, the move to $oating rates was a somewhat disorderly and

haphazard product of the breakdown of the fixed exchange rate system.

257

International Finance

11.5 WHY DID THE BRETTON WOODS SYSTEM BREAK DOWN?

!e Bretton Woods System operated with reasonable success and only occasional realignments from 1947

to 1971. Explanations of its breakdown generally concentrate on the problems of liquidity and the lack of an

adequate adjustment mechanism.

_The liquidity problem_

Well before the eventual demise of Bretton Woods, Robert Tri'n (1960) had predicted an eventual loss of

confidence in the system. Tri'n argued that there was an inherent contradiction in the gold–dollar standard.

For the Bretton Woods system to function successfully it was essential that confidence was maintained in

the US dollar; so long as central banks knew that dollars could be converted into gold at \$35 per ounce they

would willingly hold dollars in their reserves. Tri'n pointed out that as international trade grew, so would

the demand for international reserves, namely US dollars. To meet the demand for these reserves the Bretton

Woods system depended on the US running deficits, with other countries running surpluses and purchasing

dollars to prevent their currencies appreciating. Hence, over time, the stock of US dollar liabilities to the rest

- f the world would increase and this rate of increase would be higher than the annual addition to the US gold
reserves resulting from gold-mining activities. As a result, the ratio of US dollar liabilities to gold held by the
US Federal Reserve would deteriorate until eventually the convertibility of dollars into gold at \$35 per ounce
would become _de facto_ impossible.

As it became apparent that the US authorities would not be able to fulfil their convertibility commitment,

Tri'n predicted that central banks would begin to anticipate a devaluation of the dollar rate against gold. In

anticipation of this, central banks would start to convert their reserves into dollars and stop pegging their

currencies against the dollar, leading to an inevitable breakdown of the system. !e 'Tri'n dilemma' was that

continued US deficits would undermine the Bretton Woods system, yet if the US took measures to curb its

deficits this would lead to a shortage of world reserves which would undermine the growth of world trade and

exert de$ationary pressures on the world economy.

Table 11.2 shows the decline in the ratio of US reserves relative to its liquid liabilities as predicted by

Tri'n's analysis. !e Bretton Woods system worked well in the 1950s, but the confidence in the system slowly

deteriorated in the 1960s as US liquid liabilities began to outstrip its reserves; the deterioration is particularly

marked from 1968 to 1972, corresponding to the collapse of the system.

The International Monetary System

_An alternative interpretation of the demise of Bretton Woods_

Although the Tri'n dilemma at first sight seems to fit the facts quite well and is commonly held to be the

major cause of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, Jurg Niehans (1984) and Paul De Grauwe

(1989) have suggested a somewhat different interpretation of events, which is based upon an application

- f what is known as Gresham's Law. !omas Gresham (1529–79) argued that when there is a discrepancy
between the o'cial rate of exchange between two assets and their private market rate of exchange, the asset
that is undervalued at the o'cial rate will disappear from circulation, while the asset that is overvalued
will continue in circulation. When applied to the monetary field this means that 'bad money drives out
good)money'.

Gresham's Law can equally provide an insight into the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. In this case,

the two assets to be considered are gold and the dollar. Under the Bretton Woods system the o'cial rate of

**Box 11.1 The creation of special drawing rights**

Although the international monetary system was under no real strain around the mid-1960s, there

was a feeling that the growth of international reserves was inadequate. !is led to fears that the

growth of world trade and with it economic growth would be unnecessarily constrained. In addition,

the mechanism for increasing reserves was regarded as being too dependent upon the USA running

balance of payments deficits which, as Tri'n's analysis had shown, could eventually undermine the

whole system. !ese factors led to a discussion among IMF members over how to supplement the stock

  - f international reserves.

!e result of these deliberations was the First Amendment of the IMF Articles of Agreement in

1967, which empowered the Fund to create a Special Drawing Account to supplement its quota system

which operates under its General Account. Under the scheme a new reserve asset was to be created by

the Fund called the Special Drawing Right (SDR). Unlike quotas which are backed by the deposits of

Fund members, the SDR's value as a reserve asset rests on it being regarded as an acceptable means of

exchange between central banks and the Fund.

Under the SDR scheme, each member of the Fund is allocated a specified annual amount of SDRs

in proportion to their quota with the Fund. !e cumulative total holdings of SDRs allocated to a

country is known as its 'net cumulative allocation'. !e value of an SDR was originally set at 1/35th of an

  - once of gold, which was equivalent to \$1. A country can draw upon its SDR allocation whenever it is
experiencing balance of payments di'culties or needs to supplement its reserves. In contrast to quota
drawings, SDR drawings do not require consultation with the Fund, do not have conditionality attached
and are not subject to repayment. Since SDR drawings are not subject to repayment they constitute a net
addition to global reserves. However, over a five-year period a member has to maintain its SDR balance
at an average of 30% of its net cumulative allocation (reduced to 15% in 1979).

A country that draws upon its SDR allocation can exchange the SDRs with foreign authorities for

their currencies, thereby increasing its reserves. All members of the Fund are obliged to accept SDRs in

exchange for their national currency up to three times its net cumulative allocation. Countries drawing

SDRs have to pay interest, while countries in receipt of SDRs receive interest.

An increase in SDR allocations requires the consent of 80% of IMF votes. !e first planned allocation

  - f SDRs for the period 1970–72 was \$9.5 billion. In the event, these allocations proved very ill-timed

259

International Finance

because they coincided with a massive surge in international liquidity resulting from massive purchases

  - f dollars in the final years of the Bretton Woods system. As of February 2021, the total SDR allocation
was the equivalent of \$293 billion.

In July 1976 the value of the SDR was changed from \$1 to a weighted basket of 16 currencies, and in

January 1981 the SDR value was redefined as a weighted basket of five currencies, these being the US

dollar, the Deutschmark, the yen, the French franc and pound sterling. !e introduction of the euro led

to the SDR being redefined as a basket of just four currencies in January 2001. More recently, effective

October 2016, the SDR has been changed to represent five currencies with the addition of the Chinese

renminbi, the weights being: the dollar (41.73%), the euro (30.93%), Chinese renminbi (10.92%), yen

(8.33%) and pound sterling (8.09%). !e role of the SDR in the international financial system is fully

covered in Clark and Polak (2004).

exchange of these two assets was set at \$35 per troy ounce. !e US authorities were committed to buy and sell

gold with foreign monetary authorities at this price. With US prices increasing by some 40% between 1959

and 1969, the price of gold should, _ceteris paribus_, have risen by a similar amount. Indeed, as we have seen

in the private market, there was a persistent upward pressure on the price of gold, leading to the setting-up

- f the gold pool. However, these gold sales became so significant that the loss of gold led central banks to
disband the gold pool in 1968. A two-tier market for gold led to the private market price of gold rising above
the o'cial rate.

Once the o'cial price of gold became undervalued compared to the private rate, central banks could

easily have caused a major run on the dollar by converting their dollar reserves into gold and then selling

it on the private market at a profit. In a bid to preserve the fixed exchange rate system, in 1967, the USA

secured an agreement from foreign central banks not to convert their dollar reserves into gold nor sell it

- n private markets. In effect, the dollar was _de facto_ no longer convertible into gold. In the end, following
a further deterioration of the US balance of payments in 1970 and 1971, President Nixon announced
the _de jure_ )suspension of dollar convertibility into gold. Dollars had driven out gold in accordance with
Gresham's Law.

_Lack of an adjustment mechanism_

!e Bretton Woods system permitted a realignment of exchange rate parities as a last resort in case of

'fundamental disequilibrium' of a member's balance of payments. In practice, however, countries proved

extremely reluctant to either devalue or revalue their currencies or undertake other economic policy measures

required to ensure sustainable balance of payments positions. !e fact that 'fundamental disequilibrium' was

not defined did not help.

!e USA could not devalue the dollar in terms of gold since this would undermine confidence in the whole

system. In addition, a dollar devaluation against gold did not improve US competitiveness if other countries

maintained their exchange rate parities against the dollar. As such, the USA was expected to pursue appropriate

de$ationary policies at home to keep the size of its balance of payments deficit under control. In practice, the

US was extremely reluctant to de$ate its economy in order to regulate its deficit. Indeed, from the mid-1960s

President Johnson financed US involvement in Vietnam and a series of domestic social programmes through

260

The International Monetary System

in$ationary money supply increases rather than through higher taxation. !e expansionary US monetary

policy inevitably resulted in higher US in$ation and a significant widening of its balance of payments deficits.

Other countries suffering persistent current account deficits could have resorted to devaluation. In

practice, deficit countries proved extremely reluctant to devalue their currencies because such action was

viewed as a sign of governmental and national weakness. !e sense of national crisis that accompanied the UK

Labour government's devaluation of sterling in 1967 is an example of this phenomenon. !e deficit countries

were equally reluctant to adopt de$ationary policies which might cure the deficits since most had committed

themselves to the objective of achieving full employment. With the deficit countries reluctant to adjust, it was

then necessary that surplus countries take action to reduce their surpluses.

!e surplus countries included Germany, Japan and Switzerland, but they proved as reluctant to revalue

their currencies as the deficit countries were to devalue. !is was because the undervaluation of their

currencies had enabled them to experience strong export growth and biased their economies towards the

production of tradable goods. !ey believed that to revalue their currencies would risk ending export growth

and lead to unemployment in their economies as their tradables industries would be forced to contract. In

addition, they were not prepared to re$ate their economies as a means of reducing their surpluses because

they feared the in$ationary consequences.

!e recognition that in a fixed exchange rate regime the pressure was normally on debtors to undertake

economic adjustment, because of the fall in their reserves required to defend the exchange rate, had led to

the inclusion of a 'scarce currency clause' in the IMF articles. !is permitted debtor countries to adopt penal

measures against persistent surplus countries, but it was never invoked.

With neither deficit nor surplus countries being prepared to adjust their economies or exchange rates the

question of how to maintain fixed exchange rate parities in the face of persistent imbalances in the balance

payments required an answer. In a bid to prevent exchange rate realignments, the surplus countries supplied

the deficit countries' central banks with reserves on a credit basis to enable them to prevent devaluations of

their currencies. Packages were arranged to support the Italian lira in 1964 and sterling in 1965. In retrospect,

it is clear that such packages were only delaying the day when exchange rate parities would have to be realigned

and so constituted no more than a papering over the cracks.

_The seigniorage problem_

!e pivotal role of the dollar meant that the USA was the major source of international liquidity under the

Bretton Woods system. To acquire reserves the rest of the world had to run balance of payments surpluses while

the USA ran deficits. !is meant that the rest of the world had to consume less than it was producing, while the

USA had the privilege of being able to consume more than it was producing. President Charles de Gaulle of

France argued that the system conferred an 'exorbitant privilege' on the US, which was able to gain productive

long-term assets from its overseas investments in exchange for short-term dollar liabilities. US dollar Treasury

bonds accumulated by the rest of the world yielded relatively low rates of interest and their purchasing power

was eroded by US in$ation. In effect, the USA was able to borrow at very low real rates of interest. !e

actual methodology to calculate the value of such ‘seigniorage’ benefits has been an area of controversy. !ere

was resentment on the part of some deficit countries (for example Italy) that they had to adopt de$ationary

policies to correct their balance of payments deficits, while, because of the reserve currency status of the

dollar, the USA was under no corresponding pressure to correct its deficits. !e perceived seigniorage benefits

conferred)to the USA, while not one of the major reasons for the breakdown of the Bretton Woods scheme,

did, however, when the system was under strain, weaken the resolve to save the system.

11.6 THE POST-BRETTON WOODS ERA

_The first oil shock and its aftermath_

!e return to $oating exchange rates was initially regarded by central bankers as only a temporary

development until a new monetary order could be established. In the event, any hopes of a return to fixed

parities were overtaken by events. As a result of the Arab–Israeli con$ict at the end of 1973, the Oil Petroleum

Exporting Countries (OPEC) quadrupled the price of oil which had a huge impact on the world economy

and effectively ended any hopes of restoring a fixed exchange rate system. !e huge oil price rise meant a

significant deterioration of the oil importing countries' terms of trade (average price of exports/average price

- f imports) with the OPEC countries, as shown in Table 11.3, and with it significant deficits in their current
accounts, as shown in Table 11.4.

Non-oil exporting less-developed countries (LDCs) were particularly hard hit both by the rise in the price

- f their oil imports and by the recession in the industrialized countries which reduced their export earnings.
As a result the LDCs as a group experienced massive current account deficits which rose from \$8.7 billion in
1973 to \$51.3 billion in 1975. In order to assist them, the IMF set up an 'oil facility' which borrowed funds
from the surplus OPEC countries for lending to the LDCs.

!e impact of the oil shock was far from uniform, as some countries were more dependent than others on

- il imports. For example, Japan as a major oil importer suffered greatly from the shock as its current account
surplus of \$100m in 1973 became a deficit of \$4,500 million in 1974; the UK deficit widened from \$1,200
million in 1973 to \$7,800 million in 1974.

Due to its differential impact and the different policy responses adopted by governments to deal with

the shock there were marked divergences in in$ation rates. Italy and Britain, both keen to avoid recessions,

adopted expansionary macroeconomic policies which, superimposed upon the in$ationary impact of the oil

shock, led to rapid in$ation and a significant worsening in their current accounts (see Tables 11.4 and 11.5);

simultaneously there was a sharp rise in unemployment, which, combined with rising in$ation (Table)11.6),

gave rise to the term 'stag$ation’. Other countries such as Germany and Japan, who were much more concerned

to control their in$ation rates, adopted tight macroeconomic policies. Apart from its effect on current account

11.7 THE JAMAICA CONFERENCE OF 1976

In November 1975 a meeting of the major industrial nations at Rambouillet agreed to amend the Articles of

Agreement of the IMF to legitimize the $oating exchange rate regime. !e details of the Second Amendment

were worked out at the IMF annual conference held at Kingston, Jamaica, in January 1976. At Kingston the

members of the Fund formally legitimized the new $oating exchange rate system. In addition to abolishing

the o'cial price of gold, the conference aimed at increasing the importance of SDRs (see Box 11.1) in

international reserves, and there was a declaration that the SDR should become the 'principal reserve asset'.

268

The International Monetary System

_The Second Amendment_

!e Second Amendment of the IMF's Articles which came into effect in April 1978 formally gave national

authorities a large degree of discretion in selecting their exchange rate arrangements. It also urged the IMF to

adopt a policy of 'firm surveillance' over its members' exchange rate policies.

Article IV of the Second Amendment defined the obligations and responsibilities of Fund members. Each

member was obliged to notify the Fund of its exchange rate arrangement, but Fund members were basically

free to do as they wished – peg to the SDR or another currency, pursue cooperative arrangements with other

members, or adopt other exchange rate arrangements of their choice! About the only thing members could

not do was to peg their currency to gold.

In addition to defining what members of the Fund could do, the amendment also defined the role of the

IMF as being to oversee the international monetary system to ensure its effective operation. In particular, the

Fund was expected to 'exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members, and … adopt

specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies'.

Member countries were obliged to supply the Fund with information necessary for surveillance and when

requested consult with it over its exchange rate policy. !e initial guidelines drawn up by the Fund were

summarized by three principles:

1. A member shall avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order

to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over

   - ther members;

2. A member should intervene in the exchange market if necessary to counter disorderly conditions

which may be characterized _inter alia_ by disruptive short-term movements in the exchange value of

its currency;

3. Members should take into account in their intervention policies the interests of other members,

including those of countries in whose currencies they intervene.

Indications of attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates include sustained one-way reserve

movements, the introduction of trade and/or capital controls, and large-scale o'cial borrowing. However,

the IMF was not empowered to penalize governments that chose to ignore its guidelines. All in all, the Second

Amendment was merely a formal recognition of the end of the Bretton Woods system.

11.8 THE SNAKE AND THE EMS

!e member countries of the European Economic Community (EEC) had long been concerned that

their large degree of trading links with one another could be threatened by exchange rate instability. !is,

coupled with the longer-term aspiration for a fully-$edged economic and monetary union between the EEC

countries, led to the setting-up of the Snake in 1972, which had a chequered history, and was replaced by

the EMS)which)commenced operations in 1979. !e operation of the Snake and EMS is dealt with more

extensively) in Chapter) 16. What is important in the scheme of international monetary relations is that

both arrangements involved a zone of exchange rate stability between the exchange rates of the European

currencies, which re$ected in large part a dissatisfaction with allowing exchange rates to be determined by

the free market.

11.9 THE SECOND OIL SHOCK

Towards the end of 1978 the Iranian revolution disrupted its oil exports which led to a further hike in OPEC

- il prices from \$13 a barrel in mid-1978 to \$32 a barrel in mid-1980. Although this hike was not as great as
in the case of the first oil price shock, the recession that followed in the industrialized nations was far more
pronounced. !is was mainly because, on the basis of experience from the earlier shock, governments were
keen to minimize the in$ationary consequences, and as a result authorities of the industrialized countries
adopted restrictive policy responses. !ese policies led to a rise of world interest rates and major recessions in
the years 1980–81, particularly in the USA and the UK. Nonetheless, the recessions meant that the adjustment

- f the balance of payments deficits caused by the shock was quicker than that following the first oil shock. !e
OPEC surplus in 1980 of \$112 billion was turned into a deficit by 1982.

11.10 THE DAZZLING DOLLAR, 1980–85

!e period January 1980 to May 1985 witnessed a relentless and substantial appreciation of the US dollar: its

nominal effective exchange rate appreciated by around 50% and even more in real terms (see Figure 11.1).

One of the major reasons advanced for the appreciation was the divergent macroeconomic policy stances

pursued by the USA, Europe and Japan. US authorities operated a tight monetary policy but had a rather

relaxed fiscal policy, with the US budget deficit rising from \$16 billion in 1979 to \$204 billion in 1986. !is

stood in contrast to the tight monetary and fiscal policy operated by the Europeans. As US real interest rates

rose relative to rates in Europe, funds were attracted into the USA to finance its growing current account

deficit. !e US administration argued that the appreciation of the dollar re$ected the strength of the US

economy and that it was not a policy problem.

However, as the dollar appreciation continued it started to provoke a great deal of concern. A squeeze on

US export and import-competing industries contributed to a rapidly deteriorating balance of payments which

in turn led to persistent calls in Congress for protectionist measures to be adopted against trading partners,

especially Japan. Although the Europeans and Japanese were benefiting from increased exports to the US,

they were concerned about the mounting threat of US protectionism. !ey viewed the US budget deficit as

the principal cause of the US current account deficit, which they argued could only be remedied by policies

designed to reduce the US budget deficit. !e increasing concern about the US economy and the strength of

the dollar contributed in large part to the issuing of the Plaza Accord.

11.11 FROM PLAZA TO LOUVRE AND BEYOND

In September 1985, finance ministers and central bank governors from the so-called G5 countries (France,

West Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan) met at the Plaza Hotel, New York, and

issued a communiqué known as the Plaza Accord. !e statement said that the exchange rate of the dollar did

not accurately re$ect changes in the economic fundamentals, notably the US pledge to reduce its budget deficit

and measures to stimulate demand in Japan. A further depreciation of the dollar was considered desirable

and, importantly, there was a commitment to ‘cooperate more closely to encourage this, when to do so would

be helpful’. !is was followed by purchases of Deutschmarks and yen. !e Plaza Accord was a tangible sign of

growing dissatisfaction with $oating exchange rates. Following the Accord the dollar depreciated throughout

1986, although the extent to which it can be attributed to the Accord is a matter of conjecture, especially as the

dollar had begun to depreciate prior to the Plaza meeting. !e depreciation of the dollar was so substantial

that the concern by early 1987 switched to stemming its decline.

At a G7 meeting held at Paris in February 1987, the finance ministers issued what is known as the Louvre

Accord. !ey made it known that they felt that the dollar had depreciated far enough and that exchange

rates were 'broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals'. Furthermore, there was agreement to

'cooperate closely to foster exchange rates around current levels'. !e Accord was backed up by an unpublished

agreement between the parties that it is believed was aimed at keeping the dollar within a 5% target band

against the Deutschmark and the yen.

Exchange rates remained fairly stable following the Louvre Accord, but pressure for a further depreciation

- f the dollar led to large-scale purchases of dollars by the Japanese. !e dollar remained stable until October
1987 when, following the collapse of stock markets around the world, it came under renewed pressure. It was
feared that the reduced wealth and US plans to reduce its budget deficit would lead to a cut in expenditure that
could herald a worldwide recession as had happened following the stock market collapse in 1929. To reduce
the risk of recession there was a significant loosening of monetary policy around the world, with central banks
reducing interest rates. Only in January 1988 with signs that the US trade deficit had started to bottom-out
did the dollar begin to recover.

11.12 CURRENCY TURMOIL AND CRISES POST-1990

!e significant loosening of monetary policy following the stock market collapse of 1987 eventually led to

renewed pressure on world in$ation, which in turn required a series of interest rate rises to bring it under

control. In turn the interest rate rises led to recessions for the US and UK economies in 1991. !e early 1990s

also witnessed unprecedented currency turmoil, leading the Bank of International Settlements to state in its

1994 Annual Report that:

technology, innovation, free capital mobility and investors' desire for international portfolio

diversification have by now all combined to increase vastly the potential for shi(ing large amounts of

271

International Finance

financial capital around the world, and across currencies, at great speed … it is probably no exaggeration

to say that the period from late 1991 to early 1993 witnessed the most serious and widespread foreign

exchange market crisis since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system twenty years ago.

!e origins of the currency turmoil dated back to the collapse of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the

subsequent reunification of East and West Germany, followed by a decision to allow East German Ostmarks

to be converted into Deutschmarks at the very generous exchange rate parity of 1 Ostmark to 1 Deutschmark.

!is led to a near 30% increase in the German money supply, heightening in$ationary fears. In addition, to

pay for massive fiscal transfers to prop up an ailing East German economy, the German authorities became

major issuers of long-term bonds, pushing up German interest rates significantly. !is meant that other

countries in Europe that had currencies pegged to the Deutschmark in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)

were forced to raise their rates.

In June 1992, Danish voters narrowly rejected the Maastricht Treaty, the European legislation concerned

with creating a monetary union in Europe. !is led to the emergence of exchange rate tensions within the

ERM. !e Italian lira became particularly vulnerable to speculative attack, due to question marks over the

sustainability of its budget deficit; and the pound sterling, which had joined the system in May 1990, was

increasingly perceived as overvalued at its central parity of 2.95DM/£1. At the end of August 1992, opinion

polls indicated a possible French rejection of the Maastricht Treaty and the Italian lira fell towards its $oor

in the ERM. In early September the Italians raised their interest rates sharply to defend the lira while the UK

authorities announced a massive borrowing, equivalent to 20 billion Deutschmarks, to bolster the ability of

the Bank of England to defend sterling.

Following a speculative attack, the Finns were forced to $oat the markka on 8 September, and Swedish

interest rates were raised to defend the krona. On 14 September the Italian lira was devalued by 7% in the

face of massive speculative pressure. Encouraged by these successes, speculators turned their attention on the

pound sterling and, despite massive intervention by the Bank of England and a 5% rise in interest rates in a

single day, the UK authorities were forced to suspend sterling's membership of the ERM on 16 September.

On 17 September further speculation against the Italian lira led to its suspension from the ERM and a

devaluation of the Spanish peseta by 5%. !e French franc, Danish krone and Irish punt were successfully

defended, and following a joint statement by the French and German authorities that 'no change in the

central rate is justified', several weeks of calm returned. However, on 19 November the Swedish authorities

were forced to abandon the krona peg to the European Currency Unit (ECU). !is in turn led to speculative

attacks against the Portuguese escudo and Spanish peseta which were both devalued by 6% on 22 November.

Speculative pressures continued, and on 10 December the Norwegian authorities ended their peg to the ECU.

However, speculative attacks against the French franc were successfully resisted by a combination of French

interest rate rises combined with a cut in German interest rates and strong support by the German and French

authorities for the franc–Deutschmark parity.

!e Irish punt was finally devalued by 10% on 30 January 1993, and in May 1993 further speculation

led to devaluations of the escudo by 6.5% and the Spanish peseta by 8%. Further speculative attacks were

mounted against the French franc, reaching unprecedented levels when, on 29 July, Germany failed to reduce

its key discount rate despite market expectations of a 50 basis point cut. !is led to massive selling of most

ERM currencies against the Deutschmark on 30 July, which le( five currencies at the bottom of their ERM

band. Over the weekend of 31 July and 1 August, central bank governors met and decided that the only way

to save the system from complete collapse was to widen the bands in the ERM from ±2.25% to a much wider

±15%. !e last-minute widening reduced speculative pressures within the system and monetary tensions

eased, allowing German and French interest rates to fall. !e year 1993 witnessed a spectacular bull market

272

The International Monetary System

for bonds and equities, which came to an abrupt end in 1994 when the dollar hit new lows against the yen

and the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates.

_The Mexican 'tequila crisis' of 1994–95_

At the end of 1991 the Mexican government announced a change in its exchange rate such that the Mexican

peso's permissible band of $uctuation against the US dollar was widened. Despite this, the peso remained very

strong against the US dollar, trading for much of the period 1992/93 at its appreciation limit against the dollar.

!e strength of the peso was due to the Mexican government having privatized and deregulated its banking

system, combined with opening-up its capital account, the perceived success of the Brady Plan in restructuring

Mexico’s debt, and Mexico joining the North American Free Trade Area in 1993. However, starting in early

1994 things changed: there was civil unrest with an armed rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas in January

1994, the assassination of the ruling party’s presidential candidate ahead of a presidential election, and a

perceived increase in the risk of devaluation, in part because the previous appreciation of the peso had led

to a very large current account deficit of 8% of GDP. In addition to the internal factors, rises in US interest

rates started a reversal of the capital in$ows Mexico had been experiencing. !ere was a significant fall in the

foreign exchange reserves of the central bank throughout the year as foreign exchange market participants and

local residents began to anticipate a devaluation. !e speculative attack reached fever pitch a(er the election of

a new president at the start of December, and by mid-December the foreign exchange reserves were virtually

wiped out. On 20 December the Mexican government announced a devaluation of the peso from 3.50 to 4.025

pesos per dollar, some 15% below its previously announced lower limit. !is set off a further speculative attack

against the peso such that it was forced to $oat, which then led to panic on the part of foreign investors and

the peso fell dramatically to 7 pesos per dollar by March 1995 and to 7.7 pesos per dollar by the end of 1995.

!e crisis put the economy on the brink of default on its external debt; fear of this and the possible

implications led the US Treasury, in conjunction with the IMF, to arrange an emergency \$48 billion rescue

package. !e rescue package meant that the country avoided an economic catastrophe, but nonetheless rises

in interest rates and fiscal cutbacks meant that output fell by 6.6% in 1995, unemployment doubled, and

in$ation rose from 6.9% in 1994 to 35% in 1995. !e Mexican crisis not only adversely affected the Mexican

economy, but also led to significant falls in many other developing countries' stock markets and currencies,

and this process of contagion from the Mexican markets to other developing countries gave rise to the socalled 'tequila effect'. Fortunately, the economic crisis was relatively short-lived and in 1996 the Mexican

economy rebounded strongly.

_The 1997–98 Asian crisis_

Another period of almost unprecedented financial turmoil began on 2 July 1997, following the devaluation

- f the !ai baht. !e Asian economies had during the 1990s been viewed as highly successful fast-growing
economies, and they were extremely successful in attracting international capital in$ows. Terms like the
‘Asian miracle’ had become part of the international lexicon. However, the international capital in$ows
had contributed to property and stock market bubbles in many of the economies and the fast growth had
disguised structural $aws in their financial systems. When the bubbles began to burst there was a rush on the
part of international investors to exit the region and the capital in$ows abruptly became substantial capital

- ut$ows. !e result was a large fall in property values, stock market indices and in the value of many of the
currencies. !e turmoil went on from July 1997 through to the end of 1998, by which time the stock markets
and currencies had begun to recover. !e Asian crisis is more comprehensively covered in Chapter 17.

273

International Finance

_The 1998 Russian crisis_

Although the Russian economy weathered the Asian financial crisis quite well, it was nonetheless extremely

weak. !e government was running a large fiscal deficit which was financed partly by rouble debt but also

in large part by issuing debts in US dollars with an ever-rising rate of interest. By July 1998, the Russian

government was having increasing trouble financing its fiscal deficits as foreign investors became increasingly

worried about the prospects for repayment. Concern about the fate of the Russian economy led to an agreement

between Russia and the IMF for a loan of \$23 billion. However, a(er an initial tranche of the loan of \$5 billion

was made, the Russian government decided to renege on the conditions attached to the loan. !e rouble, which

had been pegged to the US dollar, started to come under severe speculative attack; in particular, many wealthy

Russians, anticipating a devaluation, sold domestic assets such as shares and bonds, leading to a collapse in

their prices and sold the roubles raised to acquire US dollars. In a bid to salvage the situation, on 17)August

1998 Russia unilaterally announced a restructuring of its rouble-denominated debt and a moratorium on its

foreign debt obligations, combined with a $oating of the rouble. !e Russian restructuring effectively wiped

- ut most of its rouble-denominated debt and caused panic on the part of international investors about the
implications of the moratorium for foreign debt repayment. A Russian request for the next instalment on
its loan was turned down by the IMF since the government had reneged on its promised fiscal reforms. !e
refusal of the IMF came as a major shock to foreign holders of Russian debt that had assumed that Russia was
'too important to fail' and would be bailed out because of its political and strategic importance. !e result of
the effective Russian default led international investors to reassess the risks of investing in emerging markets
more generally, and there were significant declines in both emerging and global stock markets. !is was
particularly the case because the Russian crisis coincided with the collapse of the investment fund Long-Term
Capital Management on 23 September 1998 (see below).

_The 1999 Brazilian crisis_

!e Russian crisis had a direct impact on Brazil. Similarities between Russia and Brazil had been noted by

speculators, in particular, like Russia, it had huge public-sector deficits combined with a large external debt.

Following the Russian default, the Brazilian real had been under increasing speculative attack and in a bid

to forestall a crisis the IMF arranged a \$40 billion loan in December 1998. !e aim of the emergency loan

was to calm investors’ fears and give Brazil time to implement a fiscal reform package. However, speculators

remained unconvinced and speculative pressures continued until, in January 1999, the Brazilian government

announced an 8% devaluation of the real. !e devaluation, however, proved insu'cient and the real was

forced to $oat before quickly falling some 40% against the US dollar. !e Brazilian economy moved into a

sharp recession with output falling some 6.1% in 1999. While the economy did make some recovery in 2000

and 2001, it was adversely affected by the Argentinian crisis of 2001–02 with output falling 8.9% in 2002 and

7.6% in 2003.

_The Long-Term Capital Management crisis_

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a hedge fund founded in 1994 which had two Nobel prizewinners in economics among its partners, Myron Scholes and Merton Miller. !e fund took what were

regarded as low-risk speculative positions in government and corporate bonds, based on interest rate spreads.

It took speculative positions when interest rate spreads in the markets were unusually high, predicting that

they would fall. !e trouble was that its positions were highly leveraged, and on a capital base of some \$5)billion

274

The International Monetary System

it had positions in the markets totalling around \$1.3 trillion and loans totalling over \$200 billion. When the

Russians announced a default on their debt this had the effect of widening the interest rate spreads in the

financial markets causing a '$ight to quality’ in international financial markets. !e result was that LTCM’s

capital base was quickly eroded, and once word got out in the markets that it was in trouble, its positions

worsened even further. !e Federal Reserve, concerned that a failure of LTCM could create a global financial

panic, organized a rescue involving a consortium of 14 American and European financial institutions that

themselves would have been in trouble if LTCM was forced to liquidate its positions at the then prevailing

market prices. !ey agreed to inject some \$4 billion of capital in return for effective control of the hedge

fund. !is injection meant LTCM was able to liquidate its positions in a controlled manner, and although the

announcement of the rescue package itself frightened the financial markets, a global financial disaster was

averted. Nonetheless, there were severe falls in stock markets and corporate bond markets for quite some time

due to a combination of the Russian crisis and LTCM's problems.

_The Turkish crisis of 2001_

!e start of the new century did not lead to an ending of the currency turmoil. !e Turkish economy and

its macroeconomic management had been a problem for many decades and it has resorted to IMF loan

packages on many occasions. In January 2000, Turkey arranged a further \$8 billion loan from the IMF and

committed itself to major economic reform and the lowering of its in$ation rate (then standing at close to

100% per annum). !e economic reform package included restructuring of its banking system and improving

its regulation, a privatization programme, a cut in subsidies and a reduction in its fiscal deficit. In addition, in

a bid to bring down its in$ation rate it adopted a crawling peg arrangement for its currency against a basket

- f the euro and US dollar. !e loan and adoption of the new programme was initially well received and
there were large capital in$ows into the country with strong economic growth. However, by November there
were signs of problems: the fiscal deficit remained large and the current account deficit had widened to 5%

- f GDP and foreign investors began to worry about the possibility of a devaluation. Fears were heightened
in December following the arrests of some well-known bankers. Overnight interest rates were raised to an
annualized 800% in early January 2001 in a bid to reduce the speculative pressures, and a new IMF loan of \$7.5
billion was announced. While this brought a transitory calm, political infighting between the president and
the prime minister over the pace and scale of economic reforms led to a further speculative attack against the
Turkish lira in February 2001. Despite a further huge rise in overnight interest rates to as high as an annualized
4,000% on 21 February, and large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market, the speculative attack
proved successful and on 22 February the authorities gave up the lira peg and announced a move to a $oating
exchange rate. Within two days the lira fell from 687,200 to 900,000 per dollar, then to 1,300,000 by 11 April
2001 and 1,600,000 by 30 October 2001. !e country went into a major recession and by May 2001 found itself
arranging yet another loan from the IMF.

_The Argentinian default of 2002_

In 1991 Argentina commenced a currency board arrangement (see Box 11.2) that pegged the peso to the US

dollar at one peso per US dollar. !e arrangement initially seemed to work quite well. Argentina experienced

strong economic growth and was successful in bringing down its in$ation rate from over 100% in 1991 to

below 1% in the years 1996 to 1998 inclusive. While the currency board arrangement was extremely successful

in helping bring down Argentina’s in$ation rate, it also meant that the peso itself was one-for-one linked to

movements of the US dollar against other currencies. !e Brazilian devaluation of 1999 had already meant

275

International Finance

a recession in the Argentinian economy, but the strength of the US dollar during 1999 and 2001 meant that

Argentina became increasingly uncompetitive, as re$ected in real GDP falls of 3.4% in 1999, 0.8% in 2000

and 4.4% in 2001, and large current account deficits. By the end of 2001 its real trade-weighted exchange rate

was some 20% above its level in 1991. In addition, the recession contributed to a worsening of the country’s

fiscal position. Following the election of a new government in 1999 there were increasing concerns about

the sustainability of the peso–dollar parity, and during 2001 interest rates began to rise. In a bid to stop the

pressure on the peso the government reached an agreement with the IMF for a \$14 billion loan. However, the

respite was short-lived as the country failed to reduce its fiscal deficits. Domestic residents increasingly began

to question the sustainability of the peg and attempted to withdraw pesos so that they could convert them

into dollars. In a bid to stop deposit withdrawals the government temporarily closed the banks in November

and announced heavy restrictions on withdrawals when they reopened. All this just increased the speculative

pressures on the peso, and in late December the government announced a default on its foreign debts. In

January 2002 the peso was devalued to 1.40 pesos per dollar, but speculative pressures continued and the

peso was forced to $oat and quickly fell to 4 pesos per dollar. In 2002 there was a severe fall in GDP of 10.9%

and a steep rise in unemployment. Despite an economic recovery in 2003 and 2004, in 2005 the Argentinian

government took a tough stance in negotiations with its creditors affected by its debt default, offering them

roughly 30 cents on the dollar on the defaulted debt.

**Box 11.2 'Hard pegs': currency boards versus dollarization**

As we shall see in section 11.13, some economists feel that with today's highly mobile capital any

country that has a merely 'fixed but adjustable exchange rate' regime will be vulnerable to periodic

speculative attacks. !e choice of exchange rate regime for a developing or emerging market economy

is either to allow the exchange rate to $oat freely or to opt for a 'hard peg' of a currency board, or even

more strongly give up its currency altogether and adopt a foreign currency – a process referred to as

'dollarization'. !e two regimes have become much more relevant in recent years: Argentina enacted a

currency board arrangement in 1991, Hong Kong has had a currency board arrangement since 1983,

and Estonia and Lithuania, who have had no track record of monetary policy management, established

currency boards in 1992 and 1994 respectively following the break-up of the Soviet Union, followed by

Bulgaria (1997) and Bosnia (1998). In the cases of Estonia and Lithuania the currency boards are now

based on parities against the euro. Other countries have gone further and given up their own money and

adopted the US dollar as their local currency, such as Panama, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. In

September 2000 Ecuador dollarized its economy, followed by El Salvador at the beginning of 2001, so

ending its fixed exchange rate between the colón and the dollar. Indeed, in crisis-prone countries such

as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and even Russia and Indonesia there have been debates about adopting the

US dollar as their currency.

Under a currency board arrangement the local currency is fixed to a foreign currency (say the

US dollar) at a given parity (one-for-one in the case of the peso and 7.74 Hong Kong dollars per US

dollar in the case of Hong Kong), with the local currency 100% backed by central bank holdings of the

foreign currency. !e central bank can only increase the domestic money supply if it has an equivalent

increase in its holdings of foreign currency assets. !e central bank is forbidden to hold domestic

currency-denominated assets and is unable therefore to monetarize any fiscal deficits by purchasing

local government bonds. !e central bank in effect becomes a 'vending machine' exchanging at the

276

The International Monetary System

announced parity of the local currency for the US dollar whenever required by economic agents. !e

primary aim of a currency board is to instil confidence in the local currency by providing an anchor for

in$ation expectations, since private agents know that the central bank is forbidden to monetarize fiscal

deficits or print excessive amounts of money. It is also hoped that the government will be forced to be

disciplined in the conduct of its fiscal policy since it knows that it will not be able to 'borrow' by selling

bonds to the central bank. A currency board should help to regulate the country's balance of payments

position; if the country is running a combined current and capital account in surplus, then the foreign

exchange reserves of the central bank will increase, enabling it to expand the money supply which will

in time reduce the surplus. Conversely, if the combined current and capital account are in deficit, then

the foreign exchange reserves of the central bank will fall, reducing the money supply, which will in

time reduce the deficit. Finally, the system should prove resilient to speculative attacks since the central

bank cannot run out of reserves as the domestic money supply is fully backed by central bank holdings

- f the domestic currency.

!ere are, however, some problems with a currency board arrangement. Since a currency board

cannot acquire domestic securities it is unable to lend to domestic banks in times of financial crisis.

!is was clearly shown in the case of Argentina when the public attempted to withdraw deposits from

the banking system and the central bank was not in a position to provide the banks with the necessary

liquidity, meaning that the banks were closed and restrictions had to be placed on deposit withdrawals.

Also, by ruling out the possibility of a surprise devaluation or the ability to finance larger fiscal deficits,

the central bank is in no position to help the economy out of recession. Furthermore, as the case of

Argentina showed, if the dollar appreciates strongly then this will undermine the competitiveness of the

local economy, especially if other regional competitors have devalued their currencies. A final problem

with a currency board arrangement is that it may be di'cult to convince financial markets and private

agents that the situation will never be reversed and that the peg will not be changed. !is was clearly the

case in Argentina: when both financial markets and local residents foresaw an end to the peg there was

a steep rise in interest rates to compensate for the risk of devaluation and a rush to withdraw deposits

and a large-scale capital $ight into US dollars.

Given that a currency board may not be a su'ciently hard regime in convincing financial markets

and economic agents that the peg will not be ended, some have argued in favour of dollarization, which

means withdrawing the local currency from circulation. Dollarization is seen as having a key advantage

- ver a currency board system in that, by ending the risk of a devaluation, it will ensure the country is
not subjected to a speculative attack such as that which ended the Argentinian board and which caused
enormous problems for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority during the Asian crisis. By ending the risk

- f a devaluation, local interest rates will no longer contain a devaluation premium. Another advantage
is that there are savings in administrative and transaction costs of having to convert the local currency
into dollars for trade and financial purposes. However, even complete dollarization is not without its
problems. Firstly, under a currency board the government holds dollar bills and bonds which earn it a
rate of interest from the US Treasury; if it moves from a currency board to dollarization, it sells the US
bonds it holds as foreign exchange reserves and uses the dollars raised to replace the local currency. It
therefore forgoes the rate of interest held on US dollar bonds and hands over the seigniorage benefit of
issuing its own currency to the US government. Another problem which it shares with a currency board
is that, by giving up its monetary autonomy, the US Federal Reserve sets its monetary policy and interest
rates according to economic conditions in the United States, hence a dollarized economy faces the risk

277

International Finance

  - f rising interest rates when its economy may be in recession. Another problem is that, although the risk
  - f devaluation may be reduced, since government debt will subsequently be issued in dollars, which the
local government can no longer print, then the country will still be subject to a possible financial crisis
and rising interest rates on its debt should economic agents fear out-of-control public finances and a
risk of default. Also, should the economy be hit by a major economic shock requiring a devaluation of
its currency, then by being dollarized it will not have available to it the depreciation/devaluation option.
Finally, the country's international competitiveness will be subject to the vagaries of the ups and downs

  - f the US dollar. !ose interested in exploring this issue further are advised to read Altig and Humpage
(1999) and Berg and Borenstein (2000) while Strezewksi (2020) has an up-to-date bibliography on the
literature concerning currency boards.

Unlike many of the other crises, the Argentinian crisis had been largely foreseen by foreign investors

and banks that had accordingly reduced their exposure to the country, and so it was mostly domestic banks

that incurred large losses due to a mismatch between their dollar liabilities and dollar assets, and a number

- f banks were closed. Although there was no initial impact on other countries in the region, the Uruguay
economy was adversely affected by the loss of Argentinian tourism and business, and repatriation of funds
by Argentinian residents from Uruguayan accounts, and in June, following a large fall in its foreign exchange
reserves, the Uruguay government announced that its peso would $oat and within two weeks its currency
fell by 50%. A run on bank deposits in Uruguay by nervous investors (who had probably learnt from the
Argentinian experience) led to a four-day closure of its banks, which were reopened only when an emergency
loan had been arranged with the United States. Brazil also got temporarily caught up in the fallout from the
Argentinian default, and in July 2002 foreign investors concerned about its external debt pulled funds out

- f the country and the real fell by some 20%. A crisis was averted and the real was stabilized when the IMF
arranged an additional \$30 billion loan package.

_Dollar turbulence_

!e dollar itself has not been immune to currency turbulence: between January and mid-April 1995 it

depreciated from 100 yen/\$1 to a mere 80 yen/\$1. However, during August and September 1995 the dollar

depreciation was reversed, in part due to intervention by the central banks of Germany, Japan and the USA.

!e subsequent reversal in the dollar's fortunes was re$ected by the fact that in October 1997 it was trading

at 120 yen/\$1. However, therea(er it resumed its downward trend and the credit crunch has meant a further

weakening, which was trading back below 80 yen/\$1 during 2012. !e moves of the US dollar against the

Japanese yen are shown in Figure 11.2.

11.13 THE EFFECTS OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH

!e credit crunch started in the financial markets in early 2007 and has necessitated an unprecedented amount

- f intervention to prop up the financial system, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom,
but also in various European economies. !ere have been major currency swings throughout the financial
crisis, for example the yen was trading at 170 yen to the euro in August 2007 but in 2012 was trading below

the interbank lending market and markets in structured finance), the foreign exchange market continued to
trade effectively in large volumes throughout the crisis. One problem throughout the crisis has been that most
countries have implicitly sought to weaken their currencies as a means of supporting their export and import
competing industries through measures such as quantitative easing. !is led to a debate about 'currency wars'
in which each country tries to depreciate its currency. Of course, if the US Federal Reserve tries to weaken
the dollar against the pound, while the Bank of England also tries to weaken the pound against the dollar,
then the two central banks are pursuing con$icting objectives and the result may be very little change in the
dollar–pound parity. !e attempts by the Federal Reserve to weaken the dollar through quantitative easing
have also alarmed central banks and policy-makers in countries such as Brazil and China that have invested
heavily in US dollar Treasury bonds as part of their foreign exchange reserves. A more detailed coverage of
the credit crunch is contained in Chapter 18.

11.14 THE EFFECTS OF THE EUROZONE CRISIS

!e creation of the euro on 1 January 1999 with 11 founding members and the addition of six other countries

by 1 January 2011 stands out as one of the major achievements of the European Union. Initially the euro was

viewed as a potential threat to the US dollar as a reserve currency. It was also believed that by being a sound

low in$ation currency the euro would be of significant benefit to countries such as Greece and Italy which

had traditionally been high in$ation and weak currency countries. However, the onset of the credit crunch

pushed countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain into severe economic contractions which exposed

the fragility of their public finances. !e state of these finances became so bad that three of the economies,

namely Ireland, Portugal and Greece, had to be bailed out during 2010 to 2012 with hastily arranged eurozone

loans and IMF funds. !e perceived risk of countries exiting the eurozone and sovereign defaults led investors

to $ee sovereign debts of the so-called PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) for the comparative

safety of German bonds. !e result was a dramatic widening in the interest spread between PIIGS bond yields

and German bond yields. A fuller discussion of issues raised by the eurozone crisis is to be found in Chapter 16.

11.15 THE EFFECTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS

In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic due to an outbreak of a highly

transmissible virus which became known as Covid-19. !e virus was highly transmissible between humans and

highly dangerous for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Governments around the world

responded with a series of economic lockdowns to try to stop the virus spreading and overwhelming their health

systems. It also led to a vigorous policy response by central banks in the way of large-scale quantitative easing

programmes and running huge fiscal deficit to offset some of the loss of economic activity. !e international

monetary system coped remarkably well with the shock given, without any major swings between the major

currencies or loss of confidence in the system. However, only time will tell if the large rises in fiscal deficits

and national debts especially in the United States resulting from the crisis undermine the dominance and

confidence of the US dollar and lead to a greater role for currencies such as the Chinese renminbi and euro.

**Box 11.3 Bitcoin, a virtual currency not issued by a central bank or needing**
**an intermediary**

!e history of money goes back a long time: the first recorded coin use was around 700 BC in Greece

and notes were used for the first time in China around AD 1100. Over time, various things have served

as money, particularly with regard to its function as a medium of exchange, including cowry shells,

beads and even cigarettes in prisoner of war camps. One of the most interesting innovations with

respect to money of recent times has been the creation of the virtual currency Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital

currency invented by Satashi Nakamoto (a figure who remains unidentified), who introduced the idea

in late October 2008 in a paper entitled 'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System' and released

the digital coin as open source so(ware in 2009. !e real genius is that bitcoins are a virtual currency

transferable from one holder to another anonymously without the need for a financial intermediary,

such as a bank or credit card company, to verify the transaction or be involved.

Bitcoins are created as a reward along with transaction fees for computer mining activity using bitcoin

so(ware by computers that verify transactions in the so-called 'blockchain' which is a public ledger of

bitcoin transactions. Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete and unalterable by repeatedly

verifying and collecting newly broadcast transactions into a new group of transactions called a _block_,

with each block containing a cryptographic hash (which includes a timestamp of the transaction) of the

previous block. Bitcoins (and fractions as little as one millionth of a bitcoin) can be transferred from

  - ne person to another if an owner digitally signs a transaction using a private key. Without knowledge
  - f the private key, a transaction cannot be signed and a bitcoin spent or transferred; the network verifies
the transaction using a public key. Bitcoins are stored in a _wallet_ which stores the information necessary
to transact bitcoins. Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography, in which two cryptographic keys, one public
and one private, are generated – a wallet is basically a collection of these keys.

!e creation of new bitcoins has slowed over time and only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created

which is likely to be achieved around 2140. !e main advantage of bitcoin transactions is that they can

be transferred from one person to another including across national borders anonymously, speedily

and at very low cost. Bitcoins can be held anonymously and be bought both online and o%ine with real

world currencies like the dollar, pound and euro at prevailing exchange rates which can change quite

rapidly. Because of the anonymity feature, bitcoins have been used in part for illegal transactions such

new closing all time high \$19,166 on 17 December. !e price of bitcoin then collapsed to \$2,195 on

15)December 2018 before making a spectacular run up in 2020 and a new peak of \$57,129 recorded on

21 February 2021.

!e price of bitcoins is affected by many things but over time they have become increasingly

expensive to mine as more computing power and electricity is required to successfully mine the coins.

!ere have also been many instances when bitcoin exchanges have been hacked which have severely

impacted bitcoin prices. For instance, in February 2014 Mt Gox, a Japanese-based bitcoin exchange,

was hacked with holders at the exchange losing virtually all their coins to the value of \$661 million. In

August 2016 Hong Kong-based Bitfinex was hacked with \$72 million of bitcoins stolen, with bitcoin

  - wners at the exchange losing an average 36% of their bitcoins. According to cryptosec.info as of end
February 2021 there had been 49 cases of security hacks on various exchanges with a total of \$2.1 billion
worth of crypto currencies stolen.

!e legal status of bitcoins varies greatly between countries with its usage outlawed in some countries

such as Russia, Bolivia and Ecuador while interestingly the US, UK and Japan have permitted bitcoin

usage as it accords with promoting financial innovation. !ere are other competitors' virtual currencies

in existence, the most prominent being Ethereum, Ripple and the so-called 'stable coin' Tether which

is used by a lot of exchanges and is pegged to the US dollar at a parity of 1 Tether equal to \$1, but there

are persistent concerns that Tethers are not actually backed by real US dollars. At the time of writing

Bitcoin had the best supporting ecosystem and was the most successful at attracting venture capitalists,

individuals and some institutions to invest in bitcoins and its associated blockchain technology. In a

way Bitcoin has emerged as a sort of global currency but it lacks legal tender status and there have also

been increased concerns about the energy being consumed trying to mine for bitcoins and other crypto

currencies. In the future it is likely that many central banks will launch their own digital coins and it will

be interesting to see if these adversely affect the private sectors' digital coins.

11.16 THE PRESENT EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM

!e present exchange rate system permits countries to adopt whatever exchange rate policy they wish,

providing that they do not peg their currencies to the value of gold. In practice, there exists a wide range of

exchange rate policies from completely free-$oating to various pegging arrangements, including currency

boards. Table 11.9 shows the exchange rate arrangements of Fund members as of 30 June 2019.

11.17 THE BIPOLAR VIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM: WHICH

EXCHANGE RATE REGIME IS BEST?

Following the series of exchange rate crises, particularly the speculative attacks on the ERM countries in the

early 1990s and on Mexico in 1994–95, a number of well-known academics suggested that there was no room

for a halfway house in a world of high capital mobility and that there was little scope for currencies to be in a

pegged but adjustable arrangement. !e international monetary system would increasingly become a bipolar

world where countries either opted for a 'hard peg', such as a currency board or a monetary union at one

extreme, or to be fully $oating at the other extreme. For example, Eichengreen (1994, pp. 4–5) argued that

countries ‘will be forced to choose between $oating exchange rates on the one hand and monetary)unification

282

The International Monetary System

- n the other'. Similarly, Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995, p. 74) argued that, for countries with an open capital
account, 'there is little, if any, comfortable middle ground between $oating rates and the adoption of a common
currency’. Summers (2000, p. 8) argues that, for economies with access to international capital markets, ‘the
choice of appropriate exchange rate regime … increasingly means a move away from the middle ground of
pegged but adjustable fixed exchange rates towards the two corner regimes’. Finally, Fischer (2001, p. 22),
looking at the IMF classification of exchange rate arrangements, argues that ‘in the last decade, there has been
a hollowing out of the middle of the distribution of exchange rate regimes in a bipolar direction, with the
share of both hard pegs and $oating gaining at the expense of so( pegs'. Nonetheless, the bipolar view of the
international monetary system has been recently challenged on an empirical basis by Rogoff et al. (2003), who,
following an extensive empirical study of the issue, find no support for the popular bipolar view that countries
will tend over time to move to the polar extremes of free $oat or rigid peg. Rather, intermediate regimes
have shown remarkable durability. !e analysis suggests that, as economies mature, the value of exchange
rate $exibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed

- r relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-in$ation credibility gain without compromising growth
- bjectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be)considerable benefits to
more $exible regimes. For developed countries that are not in a currency union, relatively $exible exchange
rate regimes appear to offer higher growth without any cost in credibility (ibid., p. 1).

An interesting point made in the Rogoff et al. study is that fixed or relatively rigid exchange rate systems

do not seem to cause particular harm to the economic growth rates of developing economies with limited

financial market development. Indeed, they can provide a useful anchor for gaining anti-in$ation credibility,

provided the country pursues a reasonable monetary policy. However, as the country develops economically

and institutionally to become an emerging market economy, there are ‘considerable’ gains to be had from

adopting a more $exible exchange rate regime; while for developed countries that are not part of a currency

union, $exible exchange rates seem to promote higher growth without loss of in$ation credibility provided

they are accompanied by an appropriate institutional framework such as an independent central bank.

An important point made by Rogoff et al. (2003) and Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003) is that it is

important to distinguish between the _de jure_ exchange rate regime of a country and its _de facto_ regime.

Many developing countries that claim to be free-$oating in fact intervene quite extensively in the foreign

exchange market. Indeed, this is also true of some developed nations such as Japan – although the yen was

supposed to be $oating during the period 2001 to 2004, it is estimated that the Bank of Japan purchased

around 700)billion)US dollars in the foreign exchange market. Rogoff et al. show that while $oating exchange

rates using the _de jure_ classification have become more commonplace, it is not true if one uses a _de facto_

classification system.

One, of course, has to be quite careful in interpreting the results of economic performance under different

exchange rate regimes. For example, the Argentinian peso was classified as a hard-peg currency following

its adoption of a currency board vis-à-vis the US dollar, but of course the peso freely $oated against other

currencies with which it traded (and which were not pegged to the dollar) since the US dollar is a freely

$oating currency. In addition, when the peso peg was ended in 2002, it coincided with a major recession in

the country that it would be unfair to attribute to its $oating. In Europe in the early 1980s, although many

currencies were classified as belonging to the fixed exchange rate system of the EMS, there were such frequent

realignments for some currencies, such as the Italian lira and French franc, that they might as well have been

classified as managed $oating. An attempt to adopt a more useful _de facto_ exchange rate regime classification

is made in Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) who, using five-year time horizons, distinguish between five coarse

types of exchange rate regime: fixed, limited $exibility, managed $oating, freely $oating and freely falling. Far

from finding a move to a bipolar world, Rogoff et al. (2003), looking at the period 1973–99, found that only

20% of regimes were pure $oats, 60% were intermediate or pegged regimes, and 20% were freely falling. !ey

argue that the _de jure_ classification system substantially overstates the existence of freely $oating or hard-peg

currencies compared to reality (2003, p. 13):

While _de jure_ intermediate regimes rose from around 10 percent of all exchange rate regimes in the

mid-1970s to about a quarter in the late 1990s, the proportion of _de facto_ regimes with an intermediate

degree of $exibility has remained at about one half since the mid-1970s. Within intermediate regimes,

however, managed $oats have become more prevalent in emerging markets over the past decade, while

  - ther developing countries have tended to move in the opposite direction toward more limited $exibility.

While some countries like Argentina and Malaysia moved to hard pegs in the 1990s, and others such as

Indonesia, Korea and South Africa moved to $oating, there were many other countries that moved away from

the bipolar view (using the _de facto_ system) to intermediate regimes, such as Brazil, Peru, Poland, Russia and

Venezuela.

!e question of which regime is best for economic performance remains a controversial and unresolved

issue. Ghosh et al. (2003) find that in$ation is significantly lower under fixed exchange rate regimes than in

intermediate or freely $oating ones, in part due to a credibility effect and in part due to a discipline effect.

number of regime years. Each crisis is counted only once and hence, if it persists over multiple years, the subsequent years are not taken

into account in the calculation. Additionally, the years an exchange rate regime transition takes place (i.e. the year preceding, the year

during, and the year following the transition) are excluded from the computation. A crisis is considered as having occurred when the

weighted average of one-month changes in the exchange rate and reserves is more than three (country-specific) standard deviations

above the country average. (b) Since the samples include many countries some of which exhibit very high volatility of growth, such as

transition economies, countries facing war etc., it may be more appropriate to look at median values rather than mean values. !e median

values are in parentheses.

_Source_ : Rogoff et al. (2003), various tables.

However, they do not find evidence of a link between the choice of exchange rate regime and economic

growth. By contrast, Levy-Yeyati and Strurzenegger (2003) find evidence that $exible exchange rates seem

to be associated with higher growth in developing countries and emerging market economies, although no

such link is found for developed industrial countries. Indeed, they find (2003, p. 1178) that on aggregate,

‘fixers grow on average 0.78% less than $oaters. !is suggests that, everything else equal, a country that

systematically opted to $oat its exchange rate a(er the demise of Bretton Woods would have ended up in

2000 with an output 22% larger than one that chose to fix'. Both papers also find some evidence that fixed

exchange rate regimes seem to be associated with higher output volatility. Rogoff et al. (2003), using a sample

- f 158)countries for the period 1970–99, examine _de facto_ exchange rate regimes against four criteria: in$ation,
economic growth,)variability of growth and the occurrence of crises. A summary of their aggregate results is
reported in Table 11.10.

A look at the aggregate figures seems to suggest that on the in$ation rate score freely $oating countries do

quite well, but this excludes countries whose currencies are freely falling (in$ation rates over 40%) which are

normally classified as $oating currencies. On economic growth there is relatively little difference between the

first four regimes, with a slightly better performance of fixed or limited $exibility regimes, though this may

be at the cost of greater variability of output compared to $oating. Finally, the probability of a crisis does not

appear to differ greatly between regimes, although limited $exibility does not fare very well. In the latter case,

however, one has to be careful because the aggregate figures are a combination of advanced, emerging and

developing countries and hide quite big variations between these groups. In particular, Rogoff et al. (2003)

find that emerging market economies are far less exposed to risk of a banking and/or balance of payments

crisis when they have a $oating exchange rate regime than when they have a fixed one. For example, they have

a 7.7% probability of a twin crisis of balance of payments (currency) and banking with a peg, and only 1.8%

probability with limited $exibility. !is latter fact may be particularly pertinent to the choice of exchange rate

regime for an emerging market economy, since Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) argue that twin crises have

287

International Finance

particularly high costs. In such economies, such crises usually commence with the onset of domestic financial

distress, which accelerates when a currency crisis then also sets in, leading to a 'vicious cycle'. !e costs of such

crises are high both in terms of the ultimate bailout costs to recapitalize the banking system and in terms of

foreign exchange reserve losses.

While there are an increasing number of studies looking at the association between exchange rate regime

and economic performance, the results must be treated with a high degree of caution. In particular, the

methodology employed and classification system used can vary quite a lot in the studies. Also, association does

not imply causation and there may be many other reasons for the divergences in performance, particularly as

between developed and emerging/developing countries. Developed countries usually have more stable and

better developed institutional frameworks, stronger financial systems and better access to international capital

markets, which make them better able to cope with economic shocks whatever exchange rate regime they

choose. By contrast, emerging market economies may be particularly vulnerable to economic shocks since

their financial systems and institutional frameworks are less developed and their access to capital markets

more constrained in times of economic distress.

11.18 REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM

!e present international monetary system has been called a 'non-system' as there is no clear set of exchange

rate arrangements among the major international currencies (the dollar, yen, euro and sterling), and as

Table 11.9 shows, a whole host of exchange rate regimes coexist between currencies. !e large and dramatic

currency swings between the major currencies, particularly between the dollar and other currencies, have

led to a variety of proposals to reform the system. All these proposals are based upon the view that it is

desirable to limit the exchange rate swings between the major currencies, though the proposals differ over the

best method to achieve this. !ree of the best-known proposals to bring some stability to the international

monetary system have been made by John Williamson, Ronald McKinnon and James Tobin and are worthy

- f some consideration. In section 11.21, we will also consider a more recent and more radical set of proposals
that focus on the recent crises and the perpetual problem of sovereign market debt.

11.19 THE WILLIAMSON TARGET ZONE PROPOSAL

In a number of papers, John Williamson (1985, 1987), Marcus Miller and John Williamson (1988) and Edison

et al. (1987) have proposed that the exchange rate between the major international currencies should be

managed within a target zone system. For each of the major currencies Williamson has suggested a method

to calculate the currency's 'fundamental equilibrium effective exchange rate' (FEEER). Broadly speaking, the

FEEER is a real effective exchange rate that is consistent with a sustainable current account position. !e

calculated FEEER would be periodically adjusted as the economic fundamentals change (for example, relative

in$ation rates), and should not therefore be confused with a fixed central rate. A country’s exchange rate would

then be allowed to $uctuate within a system of 'so(-edged bands' of 10% either side of the FEEER. !e idea

- f so( bands is that the authorities will not necessarily be committed to buy or sell the currency if it reaches
the upper or lower limit of its band. !is, it is argued, will prevent creating a one-way bet for speculators who
insist on selling a weak currency at the lower limit of its band knowing that the authorities will be obliged to
purchase the currency at what will prove to be a high rate once the currency is forced out of its band.

288

The International Monetary System

According to Williamson, the target zone proposal would have helped prevent the dramatic real appreciation

- f the dollar during 1980–85 because the USA would not have been able to pursue such an expansionary fiscal
policy over that period. Furthermore, Miller and Williamson (1987) argue that the target zone proposal can
help rule out the possibility of self-fulfilling and destabilizing foreign exchange speculation. !ere has been
criticism of the methodology used to calculate FEEERs and that the bands and adjustments will fail to rule

- ut major exchange rate swings. For an extensive review and critique of many issues raised by target zones the
reader is referred to Frenkel and Goldstein (1986).

11.20 THE MCKINNON GLOBAL MONETARY TARGET PROPOSAL

Ronald McKinnon (1982, 1984) has argued that much exchange rate volatility is due to the process of currency

substitution. He argues that in a world in which there are few capital controls, multinational corporations

and international investors like to hold a portfolio of various national currencies. He argues that demand

to hold a portfolio of national currencies is quite stable but that the composition of the total portfolio can

be highly volatile. !is means that rigid control of the supply of the individual national currencies in the

portfolio is inappropriate. He suggests 'that the Friedman rule for smooth monetary growth should be shi(ed

from a national to a carefully defined international level'. For example, if there is a switch in portfolios away

from the US dollar to hold the euro, and national money supplies are unchanged, there will be a depreciation

- f the dollar and appreciation of the euro. In turn, this will exert effects on the real economies of the two
economies.

McKinnon argues that these disruptive real exchange rate changes can be avoided if the European (German)

and US authorities peg their exchange rate by contracting the US money supply (thereby eliminating the

excess supply of dollars) and expanding the European money supply (thereby eliminating the excess demand

for euros). Such a result would happen if the US and European authorities pursued policies of non-sterilized

intervention in the foreign exchange market, purchasing the excess dollars with euros. !is policy, while

leading to changes in national money stocks, would leave the global money supply and exchange rates

unchanged and leave the two economies unaffected by the process of currency substitution.

!e McKinnon argument that currency substitution is a widespread phenomenon and therefore a major

cause of exchange rate volatility has been widely challenged (for example Dornbusch, 1983). It is more

likely that the major source of financial portfolio shi(s is not between domestic and foreign currencies but

between domestic and foreign bonds. As it happens, the appropriate response for dealing with such switches

is sterilized intervention to peg the exchange rate; for example, if there is a decrease in the demand for US

bonds and an increase in the demand for European bonds. !e appropriate response of the US authorities to

this would be to sell European bonds and purchase the excess supply of US bonds; this would leave interest

rates and exchange rates unchanged.

!ere are numerous problems with the McKinnon proposal. Many economists dispute his suggestion that

currency substitution is a major force in exchange rate movements. Also, by fixing the nominal exchange rate

at some PPP level the proposal does not allow for the possibility of real exchange rate changes which some

economists believe have been a major force behind large exchange rate swings. As we saw in Chapter 6, if

Japanese tradables productivity growth is higher than US tradables growth, then over time there needs to be a

real appreciation of the yen against the dollar. If not, the yen will become undervalued in relation to the dollar

and this could lead to serious trade frictions.

289

International Finance

11.21 THE TOBIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TAX PROPOSAL

James Tobin (1978) has argued that much of the disruptive exchange rate movements witnessed under

$oating regimes have been caused by destabilizing short-term capital $ows. He argues (p. 154) that the

highly integrated world capital markets leave very little room for national authorities to pursue independent

monetary policies:

National economies and national governments are not capable of adjusting to massive movements

  - f funds across the foreign exchanges, without real hardship and without significant sacrifice of the
  - bjectives of national economic policy with respect to employment, output, and in$ation. Specifically,
the mobility of financial capital limits viable differences among national interest rates and this severely
restricts the ability of central banks and governments to pursue monetary and fiscal policies appropriate
to their national economies.

Specifically, a raising of the domestic interest rate can cause a sharp real appreciation, while a lowering

- f interest rates can lead to a sharp real depreciation. To reduce these effects, Tobin suggests that a tax be
imposed on all foreign exchange transactions 'to throw some sand in the wheels of our excessively e'cient
international money markets' (ibid.). !e tax would reduce the incentives for speculators suddenly to $ood
money into and out of a currency in response to small interest rate changes. He argues that a small tax of, say,
1% would especially hit short-term capital movements but not greatly interfere with longer-term ones. !is
would restore some autonomy to domestic monetary authorities.

Tobin acknowledges that, in order to be effective and avoid evasion, the tax would have to be applied to all

foreign exchange transactions and not merely to capital transactions. He acknowledges that there would be a

curtailing effect on international trade but argues that the reduced exchange rate movements and extra degree

- f national monetary autonomy would be worthwhile.

Tobin's proposal differs significantly from those of Williamson and McKinnon because his proposal is

motivated by the belief that the exchange rate regime is not the major problem; rather he traces the problem

to excessive capital movements. He displays considerable scepticism over the rationality of foreign exchange

market speculation and argues that, unlike irrational speculation in innocuous markets like rare coins, such

speculation in the foreign exchange market has very harmful effects.

!ere have been numerous criticisms levelled against Tobin's proposal. Clearly not all short-term capital

movements are undesirable, and the tax would prevent some stabilizing movements. For instance, to the

extent that the tax was effective it would reduce the depth and breadth of markets, and this reduction in

liquidity could well make the markets more volatile than less. Furthermore, some argue that in order to be

effective the tax would have to be set at a level that would have a significant curtailing effect on international

trade. Another problem is that with today's modern financial markets it is likely that the tax would be easily

circumvented as financial innovation would lead to a replication of speculative positions through synthetic

instruments that were unaffected by the tax. As for the extra degree of national monetary autonomy that the

policy may give, it is not clear that this would be wisely used. It is argued that it is precisely the threat of sudden

exchange rate movements that imposes a degree of discipline on national authorities' conduct of economic

policies; as Haggard and Maxfield (1996, p. 36) put it, 'increased financial integration holds governments

hostage to foreign exchange and capital markets, forcing greater fiscal and monetary discipline than they

might otherwise choose'. Finally, in a bid to avoid the tax there could a greater use of barter trade which is

notoriously ine'cient.

290

The International Monetary System

11.22 REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE

!e aim of the debate on reform of the international financial architecture has been about reducing the

frequency of crises and also the costs, both financial and economic, when they do occur. !e origins of this

debate follow on from a study commissioned by the G10 industrialized nations to see what lessons could be

distilled from the Mexican 1994–95 crisis. !e report was chaired by Jean-Jacques Rey from Belgium and has

become known as the Rey Report (1996). It was particularly concerned about the problem of moral hazard

and the fact that automatic recourse to large-scale o'cial financing was bailing out imprudent borrowers and

lenders alike:

Neither debtor countries nor their creditors should expect to be insulated from adverse financial

consequences by the provision of large-scale o'cial financing in the event of a crisis. Markets are

equipped, or should be equipped, to assess the risks involved in lending to sovereign borrowers and to

set the prices and other terms of the instruments accordingly.

!e series of crises that have a%icted developing/emerging market economies, such as the Asian financial

crisis and more recently the global financial crisis that started in 2007, has stimulated a more intense debate

about whether there are fundamental $aws in the international monetary system that need addressing. In

particular, as we shall see in Chapter 17, the Asian financial crisis affected a number of countries which looked

to be in good shape on the basis of their macroeconomic fundamentals. None of the countries was running

excessive budget deficits, in$ation rates were under control and none were engaging in overly expansionary

monetary policies. Although there were current account imbalances they hardly seemed to merit the kind of

crisis that subsequently occurred. In retrospect, it seems that the crisis that a%icted these economies was not

because of national policy mismanagement, but rather something to do with fundamental $aws in the current

international financial system. In addition, international policy-makers were disturbed by the way in which

an apparently innocuous devaluation of the !ai baht could have such a contagious effect on so many other

countries. !e term 'economic contagion' captures the idea that an adverse economic event in one country can

quickly spread and infect (that is, provoke a crisis) in otherwise healthy-looking economies. Another element

- f the international system has been the large amount of sovereign debt that has made countries vulnerable
to speculative attacks. In a speech on 26 November 2001, Anne Krueger, Deputy Managing Director of the
IMF, put it this way:

We lack incentives to help countries with unsustainable debts resolve them promptly and in an orderly

way. At present the only available mechanism requires the international community to bail out the

private creditors. It is high time this hole was filled.

We cannot go into great detail on all the various proposals for reform that have been put forward or the

criticisms and merits of them here – the interested reader is referred to Rogoff (1999) and Frankel (1999))–

but it is clear that there are a number of elements that those arguing for reform are concerned about. It

should also be remembered that there are those that argue that the present system is not really in need of

much reform. Instead, they argue that prevention is better than the cure and there would be less likelihood

- f crises if the banking and financial systems in developing and emerging market economies were improved.
In particular, there should be more transparency in the provision of information; better banking systems

- perating with proper risk-return criteria, combined with better regulation and supervision; and improved

291

International Finance

corporate governance of the companies to which they lend. !ese should be coupled with sounder rules for

public finances and independent central banks mandated to seek price stability, and so forth.

!ere is an intense debate about the role of the IMF in the international monetary system. At one extreme

some would like to see it abolished since its very existence encourages some reckless behaviour on the part

- f borrowers and lenders of funds, who factor in the likelihood of an IMF rescue package should things go
wrong. In other words, the IMF itself introduces moral hazard (see Box 17.1 in Chapter 17 for more details)
into international capital markets, making crises more likely to occur than if it did not exist. At the other
extreme, there are those that argue that the IMF lacks the necessary funds to do its job properly: it is forced
to require overly burdensome adjustment on the part of crisis-a%icted nations since it simply does not have
su'cient funds to grant them what they need. Others argue that the IMF needs to redefine its role and show
greater variety in its programmes than the standard de$ationary package that it normally requires a country
to follow. In particular, some critics, whilst acknowledging that the IMF has a valid role to play when crises

- ccur, argue that it should restrict itself primarily to financial issues and keep out of areas such as structural
reform requiring bank closures and privatization. It should also consider the social impact of its programmes,
for example on unemployment rates and economic growth.

Another element of the international financial system that may not be reformable, but might be made less

significant for developing and emerging market economies, is the free movement of international capital.

Some well-known economists such as Jagdish Bhagwati (1998), Paul Krugman (1998) and Dani Rodrik

(1998) have argued that the current IMF rules that require members to seek the ultimate goal of capitalaccount convertibility should be relaxed – developing and emerging market economies should be permitted

to use capital controls so that they can regain some monetary and macroeconomic independence. Bhagwati

is very critical of both the US Treasury and the IMF for rushing too many developing and emerging market

economies into relaxing their capital controls without su'cient consideration of whether their domestic

banking and financial systems are su'ciently strong and well-regulated to cope with the capital in$ows and

- ut$ows to which they would be exposed.

Some authors such as Mishkin (1994) and Fischer (1999) argue that there needs to be a new international

agency (a new international lender of last resort) with credit lines ready to make emergency loans to countries

being subjected to 'unwarranted' speculative attacks. !e mere knowledge that such an agency exists would

make speculators wary of taking on currencies where the fundamentals were relatively sound but which are

vulnerable to a speculative attack because, for instance, they possess a low level of foreign exchange reserves or

are stuck in a recession. Others are worried that such lender-of-last-resort facilities would merely exacerbate

the problem of moral hazard and that the G7 countries and the IMF countries already effectively provide such

a facility.

!e problem of the large overhang of sovereign debt has been a recurrent theme in many of the recent crises.

Some argue that certain countries have such high levels of external debt that they are effectively bankrupt or

placed in a position where economic growth is severely constrained for the foreseeable future by the need to

make debt repayments at the expense of living standards and investment in the country's future. It is argued

that there may need to be an international bankruptcy court along the lines proposed by Sachs (1995) where

nation states with excessive debt levels could go to seek some sort of protection from their creditors, akin to the

use of Chapter 11 bankruptcy provisions that corporations frequently use in the United States, or Chapter)9

provisions which cover bankrupt local and state governments. !e court would be able to grant the debtor

nation a right to suspend payments to creditors and possibly mandate an orderly restructuring package and

even debt relief. Such a court would need to be invested with powers that would be enforceable and possibly

- verride con$icting national laws and existing debt clauses. Chapter 11 provisions apply to corporations and
give the court extensive powers, including the ability to fire the existing board of directors, which is hardly

292

The International Monetary System

going to be allowed at the country level. Not everyone agrees that such a court would be a good idea; some

argue it would inevitably become 'a friend' of either the debtors or the creditors. Others argue that such a

court is unnecessary and that it should be le( to the markets to insert innovative clauses into debt securities

issued by debtor nations, making it more transparent and automatic as to what should happen in the event of

a declared default; this way investors in such bonds would have clearer evaluation of the risks they face and

less room to complain should a default be declared.

While there are numerous proposals for reform of the international financial system, it is quite clear that

there is no consensus concerning the best way to progress forward. As Eichengreen (1999) notes, some of the

grander schemes are 'politically unrealistic, technically infeasible, or unlikely to yield significant improvements

in the way crises are prevented, anticipated or managed'. !e differing proposals re$ect differing views on

what the problems are of the current system; and even when commentators agree on the identification of

a problem there is not necessarily an agreement on the best way to solve the problem. O(en the views are

diametrically opposite: some argue for $oating exchange rates while others argue that fixed rates are best;

some argue for an international lender of the last resort while others oppose it on the grounds that it will add

to the problem of moral hazard.

11.23 CONCLUSIONS

Since the Second World War the international monetary system has moved from the Bretton Woods system

which represented a cooperative venture between the major industrialized countries with the dollar at the

heart of the system into a far more diversified system. To some extent this re$ects the fact that the world

economic system has evolved from one which was dominated by the US economy to one in which economic

power is increasingly shared amongst an integrated Europe, Japan and the USA and other emerging regions

such as Southeast Asia and Latin America. While the dollar remains the major reserve currency, and this role

has to date only been infringed upon at the margins by the SDR, over time the euro will likely impinge upon

the dollar's dominance and the international monetary system is likely to look very different in 20 years' time.

A greater sharing of economic power has been accompanied by a larger degree of interdependence between

economies with respect to both trade and capital $ows, and the international monetary system has been

constantly evolving to cope with these changes. !e move to $oating exchange rates was partly motivated by

a desire to provide countries with an extra degree of independence in an increasingly interdependent world.

However, the policy divergences and real exchange rate changes throughout the 1980s and 1990s and early

part of this century have amply demonstrated that $oating exchange rates do not provide an escape from

this interdependence. !e currency turmoil in the 1990s, the post-2000 crises, and the dramatic movements

between the dollar and euro have demonstrated that a stable international monetary system has yet to

emerge. !is recognition has led to increased discussion among policy-makers about policy coordination,

and economists have become increasingly interested in the empirical performance of different exchange rate

regimes. At times, such as indicated by the Plaza and Louvre Accords, this discussion has led to concerted

action. Dissatisfaction with the present system, particularly with the large real exchange rate changes that

have occurred, has led to a variety of differing proposals which all seem to have the motivation to limit by one

means or another the substantial real exchange rate changes that have occurred. Many of the recent crises have

been concentrated in developing and emerging market economies and there is an intense debate about what

is the best exchange rate regime that such countries should adopt.

!ere have recently been a number of empirical studies looking at the choice of exchange rate regime

- n macroeconomic performance, and while the results are somewhat unclear and need to be interpreted

293

International Finance

with caution, it does seem to be the case that fixed exchange rates may well be more appropriate regimes for

developing countries with limited access to international markets and who lack stable institutional structures

and developed financial markets. For developed nations which have ready access to international capital

markets, stable institutional frameworks and relatively well-developed financial institutions/markets, the

choice of exchange rate regime does not matter so much. More interestingly, the recent research tentatively

suggests that the choice of regime may well be more critical for emerging market economies that are developing

their institutional infrastructures, financial institutions and markets and that have significant but volatile

access to international capital markets. !e evidence, although not clear-cut, suggests that as they develop,

emerging market economies may well benefit in the way of improved economic performance and reduced risk

- f a crisis by increasing the degree of $exibility accorded to the exchange rate.

12.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter we take a detailed look at two important markets that exert a great deal of in$uence on the

international financial system: the eurocurrency market and the Eurobond market. Eurocurrency markets

are defined as banking markets which involve short-term borrowing and lending conducted outside of the

legal jurisdiction of the authorities of the currency that is used. For example, eurodollar deposits are dollar

deposits held in London and Paris. !e eurocurrency market has two sides to it: the receipt of deposits and

the loaning out of those deposits. By far the most important eurocurrency is the eurodollar which currently

accounts for approximately 60–65% of all eurocurrency activity, followed by the euroeuro, eurofrancs (Swiss),

eurosterling and euroyen. !e use of the prefix 'euro' is somewhat misleading because dollar deposits held

by banks in Hong Kong or Tokyo are equally outside the legal jurisdiction of the US authorities and also

constitute eurodollar deposits. !is more widespread geographical base means that euromarkets are o(en

referred to as 'offshore' markets.

Since the 1960s there has been an astonishing rate of growth of the eurocurrency market (see Table 12.1). In

1963 the gross total value of eurobank assets (a similar figure applies to deposit liabilities) was approximately

\$12.4 billion, but by mid-2020 the eurodollar market stood at \$32,633 billion, which works out at an average

growth rate of 14.8% per annum over the 57 years! Measuring the actual size of the eurocurrency market

presents some di'culty because a distinction needs to be made between the gross and net size. !e gross

measure includes both non-eurobank and interbank deposits, while the net measure excludes interbank

deposits. !e gross measure gives an idea about the overall activity in the euromarkets, while the net measure

gives a better indication concerning the ability of the eurobanking system to create credit.

!e eurocurrency market is part of the international money market since it involves lending and borrowing

for a period of less than a year. By contrast, the Eurobond market is part of the international capital market

and involves lending and borrowing for periods of more than a year. A Eurobond is a bond that is sold by

a government, institution or company in a currency that is different from the country where the bond is

issued. For example, a dollar bond sold in London is a dollar Eurobond, and a sterling bond sold in Germany

is a sterling Eurobond. Both the eurocurrency and Eurobond markets are in many ways phenomena of the

increasingly open world trading system. !ere is no reason why borrowing and lending in a given currency

needs to be carried out exclusively in the particular country that issues the currency.

In this chapter, we deal with the origins and reasons for the subsequent rapid growth of eurocurrency and

Eurobond markets over the last three decades. We also examine the basic functioning of these markets and

their economic impact. Firstly, we look at the eurocurrency markets and then the Eurobond markets.

12.2 PARTICIPANTS IN THE EUROCURRENCY AND EUROBOND MARKETS

Before looking at the eurocurrency and Eurobond markets it is worth examining the participants who

use these markets and their motivations. !ere are numerous participants in the international money and

capital markets, including national governments; local authorities; and financial institutions – such as banks,

296

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

multinational firms, companies and international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the

World Bank and the European Investment Bank – as well as private investors. Most industrialized countries'

participants act both as lenders and borrowers of funds, while many developing countries use the markets

almost exclusively for borrowing purposes. !e various types of capital $ows between economic agents of

different countries are motivated by various factors; these include:

**Trade financing motive:** much trade is financed by borrowing on the international money and

capital markets;

2. **Borrowing/lending motive:** many capital $ows are simply motivated by the desire of savers to get the

best possible return on their money, while borrowers are merely seeking to obtain the lowest possible

interest rate;

3. **Speculative motive:** much borrowing or lending is due to the taking of speculative positions based

	- n profiting from prospective interest rate and exchange rate changes;

4. **Hedging motive:** much borrowing and lending is motivated by a desire to hedge positions; that is, to

avoid losses resulting from prospective interest rate and exchange rate changes;

5. **Capital flight motive:** many movements of capital are motivated by a desire to protect investors'

funds from penal taxation, possible seizure by the domestic government or to escape potential

restrictions being imposed on convertibility or to avoid political risk.

12.3 THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE EUROCURRENCY MARKET

!e origins of the eurocurrency market can be traced back to 1957. !e Russians having acquired US dollars

through their exports of raw materials were, given the strong anti-communist sentiment prevailing in the

USA and the Cold War, reluctant to hold these funds with US banks. Instead, they were held in an account

with a French bank in Paris, the cable address of which was EURO-BANK. Also in 1957, the Bank of England

introduced restrictions on UK banks' ability to lend sterling to foreigners and foreigners' ability to borrow

sterling. !is induced UK banks to turn to the US dollar as a means of retaining London's leading role in

the financing of world trade. In 1958 the abolition of the European Payments Union and restoration of

convertibility of European currencies meant that European banks could now hold US dollars without being

forced to convert these dollar holdings with their central banks for domestic currencies.

An important impetus for the rapid growth of the eurodollar market came from the increased regulation

- f domestic banking activities by the US authorities. !ree measures were of particular note in this respect.
In 1963 the US government introduced 'Regulation Q' which imposed a 5.25% ceiling on the rate of interest
that US banks could pay on savings and time-deposit accounts (the idea being to prevent US banks pushing
up interest rates in a competition for depositors' funds, which might then lead to risky lending policies). Since
the regulation did not apply to offshore banks this encouraged many US banks to set up subsidiaries abroad
in centres such as London. In the same year, the US authorities concerned about the impact of capital out$ows

- n the US balance of payments introduced the Interest Equalization Tax (IET). !e IET raised the cost to
foreigners of borrowing dollars in New York; but this then led them to borrow funds on the eurodollar market
(the IET was abolished in 1974). A further measure that restricted lending to foreigners by US banks was the
Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint Guidelines which were issued in 1965 and made compulsory in 1968.

!is increased regulation of US domestic banks gave a boost to the development of eurobanking activities

to circumvent the effects of these controls. Many US banks decided to set up foreign branches and subsidiaries

297

International Finance

to escape the banking regulations. Indeed, since US banking law severely restricted US banks' ability to operate

in more than one state, setting up subsidiaries abroad was an important means of expansion. More importantly,

the regulations conferred a competitive edge to eurobanks which were not subject to such regulations.

Following the hike in oil prices in 1973/74, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries

(OPEC) deposited large amounts of surplus dollars on the euromarkets. !e eurobanks then on-lent much

- f the funds to oil-importing countries that faced balance of payments problems. As such the eurobanks
played an important intermediary role in recycling funds from the surplus OPEC countries to the deficit oilimporting countries. A similar role was performed by the eurobanks following the second oil price shock at
the end of 1978, though on a lesser scale. !e vast majority of loans made by the eurobanks to the developing
countries in the 1970s and early 1980s were made by syndicates of eurobanks. A syndicate is normally led by
a lead or managing bank, with other banks that wish to participate in a loan contributing to its funding. Such
syndicated loans are useful from the perspective of individual eurobanks because they reduce the exposure

- f a eurobank to a given borrower, and by participating in a wide range of syndicated loans a eurobank can
diversify and reduce its loan risks far more than by engaging in a limited number of large individual loans.

A final factor behind the growth of eurobanking activity has been the rapid growth of world trade, which

means that more companies have excess working balances in a foreign currency on which they seek high rates

- f return, while others require short-term borrowing facilities at competitive rates of interest.

In December 1981 the Federal Reserve, recognizing that many US banks had set up offshore branches

to avoid US regulations in exotic locations such as the Bahamas and Cayman Islands, decided to legalize

so-called international banking facilities (IBFs). IBFs essentially permit US banks to conduct eurobanking

business free of US regulations in the United States by maintaining a separate set of books for this business.

IBFs are not subject to reserve requirements, interest rate regulations or deposit insurance premiums, but they

can only accept deposits and make loans to non-US residents. In addition, IBF business is maintained on a

separate book to the parent bank. IBFs have proved to be popular since their inception and much business

that was previously carried out in offshore o'ces has been relocated back to the USA. Following the success

- f IBFs, in 1986 the Japanese government permitted the setting-up of a Japanese Onshore Market (JOM)
which likewise permits Japanese banks to take on euroyen deposits in Tokyo provided these are not on-lent
to domestic Japanese residents.

12.4 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EURODOLLAR MARKET

!e major centres for eurobank activity are London, Paris, New York, Tokyo and Luxembourg. Offshore

banking centres in Bahrain, Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Panama, the Netherlands, Antilles

and Singapore account for most of the remaining business.

Eurobanks are generally free of government regulation, and more specifically they do not face compulsory

reserve requirements, interest ceilings or deposit insurance. !e main users of the eurocurrency market

facilities are the eurobanks themselves, non-eurobank financial institutions, multinational corporations,

international institutions, and central and local government. Multinationals are attracted by the relatively

high interest rates paid on their surplus corporate funds and the competitive borrowing rates. International

- rganizations such as the World Bank frequently borrow funds from eurobanks for lending to developing
countries. A large proportion of eurocurrency transactions are between eurobanks themselves, those with
surplus funds loaning to eurobanks that have lending possibilities but are short of funds.

!e pivotal rate of interest for the eurocurrency markets is the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR),

which is the rate of interest that London clearing banks will charge for loans between themselves on the

298

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

London interbank market. Non-bank borrowers then pay a spread above LIBOR depending on their credit

rating and the lending bank's transaction costs; non-bank depositors typically receive a rate of interest on their

deposits below LIBOR. In the early days of the euromarket, the interest paid on deposits and charged for loans

was usually fixed for the whole period of the deposit or loan. Increasingly, however, $oating interest rates

based on LIBOR have become the norm for mediumto long-term (above six months) deposits and loans.

With $oating rates, the interest charged on a mediumto long-term loan is adjusted every three or six months

to stay a fixed spread above LIBOR. In effect, many long-term loans are a succession of short-term loans that

are automatically 'rolled over', but at interest rates that vary in line with changes in LIBOR. !ere are usually

penalties to be paid if deposits are withdrawn before maturity.

One of the interesting characteristics of the structure of eurobank assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits)

is that they are predominately of a short-term nature with some deposits being as short as one day (overnight

deposit) and the vast majority under six months. Furthermore, there is a close matching of the maturity

structure of deposits and liabilities. Typically, if money is taken in for three (six) months then it will be loaned

- ut for three (six) months. !is is because eurobanks have to be wary of sudden large withdrawals of shortterm funds. Another motivation behind the close matching of assets and liabilities is that it reduces the risks
to the banks due to interest $uctuations. Consider a simple example of the risk involved when liabilities and
assets are not matched. In the case where a eurobank receives a \$1 million three-month deposit on which it
has to pay 7.5% interest and it loans out the funds at 8% for six months, if at the end of three months a rise in
deposit interest rates means that it has to pay 9% to retain the deposit, it would effectively be losing money

- n the remaining three months on the outstanding loan. !is would not be the case if the loan was renewable
at three months since it could then raise the interest charged on the loan for its remaining three months to,
say, 9.5%. !is close matching of assets and liabilities stands in contrast to the balance sheets of domestic
banks which usually accept short-term demand and time deposits and then engage in mediumto long-term
lending. It should be noted that since 1982 the existence of eurodollar futures markets in Chicago, New York
and London has enabled eurobanks to protect themselves against interest $uctuations without matching their
assets and liabilities.

12.5 THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF EUROBANKS

!e main reason for the continuing success of eurobanking, despite the relaxation of regulation on US banks,

is that they are able to offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates than US banks. It is this competitive edge

which is the fundamental reason for their continued popularity and growth. !e competitive advantage of

eurobanks is illustrated in Figure 12.1.

International Finance

!e eurobanks are generally able to pay a higher rate on deposits and charge a lower rate for loans than

US banks can for similar facilities. !is implies that the interest rate spread, that is, the difference between the

rate paid on deposits and charged for loans, is lower for the eurobanks than US banks. !e lower euro-interest

spread can be accounted for by a number of factors:

1. Eurobanks, unlike domestic banks, are free of regulatory control and in particular they are not

required to hold reserve assets. !is gives them a competitive advantage over domestic banks which

are required to hold part of their assets in zero or low-interest liquid assets to meet o'cial reserve

requirements. Since eurobanks are not subject to reserve requirements they are able to hold less

money in the form of low-interest reserves, enabling them to pay a higher interest rate on deposits

and charge a lower rate on loans. For example, up until 1990 the Federal Reserve imposed a 3%

reserve requirement on US banks so that for every \$100 taken in only \$97 could be lent out, on an

interest rate of 10%, which amounts to the need to charge 10.31% to cover the cost of the reserves.

Eurobanks benefit from economies of scale; the average size of their deposits and loans (hundreds

    - f thousands and usually millions of dollars) is considerably greater than those of domestic banks

(usually tens, hundreds and thousands of dollars). !is means the average operating cost associated

with each dollar deposit and loan transaction is much lower for eurobanks.

3. Eurobanks avoid much of the personnel, administration costs and delays associated with complying

with domestic banking regulations. Eurobanks do not have to maintain a large branch network for

their business, whereas domestic banking activity usually requires the maintenance of an extensive

branch network. In addition, domestic banks need extensive internal control mechanisms and large

costly legal departments, whereas eurobanks have far less need for these.

4. !e eurobanking business is highly competitive internationally with relatively easy entrance

requirements as compared to domestic banking activity, which encourages greater e'ciency and

more competitive pricing on the part of eurobanks.

5. Eurobanks do not have to pay deposit insurance whereas US banks have to insure their deposit base

with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

6. Eurobank lending is almost exclusively to high-quality customers with a virtually negligible default rate,

which contrasts with the relatively high default rates faced by domestic banks that have to charge an

appropriate default risk premium in the way of higher lending rates and lower deposit rates of interest.

12.6 THE COEXISTENCE OF DOMESTIC AND EUROBANKING

Since eurobanks generally pay higher interest rates on deposits and charge lower interest rates on loans than

US-based banks, it is natural to ask why all borrowing and lending is not carried out via eurobanks. !e

answer lies in the transaction costs for the parties involved. It usually pays a US firm to go to its local US bank

for a loan because the local bank will have a record and understanding of the business and will be able to

assess more easily the risk of lending to the business, secure collateral and monitor the progress of the loan.

If the firm were to go to a eurobank it could prove expensive to convince the eurobank that it is creditworthy

and that the project is soundly based. Similarly, except for substantial sums of money, it is not usually worth

individuals and small enterprises holding a eurodeposit as they rarely have su'cient surplus funds to be

- f interest to the eurobanks, and most private agents prefer the use of other bank facilities such as cheque
accounts, easy access to funds and the like, which are not offered by the eurobanks.

300

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

12.7 THE CREATION OF EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS AND LOANS

Eurobanks are basically financial intermediaries whose function is channelling funds from a non-bank

lender to a non-bank borrower. Between the deposit and the lending there may be a series of interbank

transactions. To enhance the understanding of eurocurrency markets we will consider a hypothetical example

- f how eurocurrency deposits and loans are created. Assume that a US multinational 'SUPER Corp' starts
- ff the process by transferring \$50 million from its US bank account into a eurodollar deposit account with
‘EUROBANK A’. EUROBANK A may not have an immediate use for these funds. However, EUROBANK B
has a client ‘MINI Corp’ who wishes to borrow \$50 million, but EUROBANK B is short of the necessary funds.
In this instance, EUROBANK B borrows the \$50 million from EUROBANK A at $LIBOR and then loans the
funds to the ultimate borrower MINI Corp. A summary of these transactions is shown in Figure 12.2.

From these transactions we can see what has basically occurred: SUPER Corp has switched a dollar deposit

from a US bank to EUROBANK A; EUROBANK A has a new deposit liability to SUPER Corp, but now also

holds increased funds which it can utilize for lending purposes. As far as the US banking system is concerned,

the amount of deposits held by the non-bank public has fallen; however, these funds have been switched into

the eurobanking arena. !e transfer of funds from EUROBANK A to EUROBANK B constitutes an interbank

transaction, the effect of which is to raise the total of eurodollar deposits from \$50 million to \$100 million.

We can now distinguish between the effect on the net size of the eurodollar market – the original \$50 million

deposit and the gross size of \$100 million, which includes the interbank transaction. With the loan to MINI

Corp the funds that were initially deposited by SUPER Corp have been given an ultimate use.

!e eurobanks are in effect acting as financial intermediaries, ensuring that surplus funds from one

- rganization (SUPER Corp) are transferred to other organizations with borrowing requirements (MINI
Corp). When MINI Corp starts to spend money, then the dollars have ultimately been derived from the US
banking system, not from the eurobanks. Only the US banking system creates dollars; the eurobanks create
deposits which are not a means of payment. Eurobanks are essentially financial intermediaries: they accept
deposits and then loan out these funds.

!e real question which now arises is what MINI Corp does with its borrowed funds. If it were just to

redeposit them with another eurobank then the whole process could be restarted; however, this is most

unlikely to be the case. More likely, MINI Corp will use the funds to pay various bills due or to finance a

project, and only a small fraction of its \$50 million (for example, \$1 million to \$5 million) will eventually end

up back in the eurobanking system which can then be used to create further credit.

!is is a highly simplified example of the way the eurobanking system creates credit. !ere are some

- bvious limits to the amount of credit created by the eurobanking system. In the first instance, EUROBANK
A and EUROBANK B are unlikely to lend out instantly all the deposits they receive; and MINI Corp is likely

\$50 million

**Figure 12.2** !e creation of eurobanking activity

301

to redeposit only a fraction of its money with the eurobanking system. It is quite likely that most of the money

received by MINI Corp will eventually be reinjected into the American economy and thereby returned to the

US banking system, from which there may be some limited leakage back to the eurocurrency markets.

12.8 THE PROS AND CONS OF THE EUROCURRENCY MARKETS

One of the major concerns expressed about eurocurrency markets is that they have enormous amounts of

funds and the potential to create credit and yet remain unregulated. Some argue that eurobanking activity is

a ticking time-bomb underneath the world financial system. !e fact that eurobanks are not regulated and do

not have access to lender-of-last-resort facilities, combined with the high degree of interbank activity, has led

to concerns that the failure of one eurobank would have serious knock-on effects on other eurobanks and in

so doing endanger the entire international financial system.

Another concern expressed about the euromoney markets is their potential impact on in$ation. !e

rapid growth of the eurocurrency markets in the 1960s and 1970s coincided with a pronounced rise in the

in$ation rates of the industrialized nations. Some policy-makers and economists argued that eurocurrency

market growth was partly responsible for this. !e basis of the argument was that the growth of eurocurrency

markets with no reserve requirements had an expansionary effect on national money supplies and thereby

helped to fuel in$ation rates. For example, Friedman (1969) and Mayer (1970) made initial estimates which

suggested that euromarkets had a very expansionary effect on money supplies because of their low reserve

ratios. However, Klopstock (1968) noted that eurobanks have very low redeposit ratios which considerably

reduces their ability to create credit. Furthermore, McKinnon (1977) makes the important point that what is

important in deciding whether eurobanks are responsible for credit creation is their net addition to the supply

- f dollars, that is, the addition to the global supply of dollars as compared to the supply of dollars in their
absence. On this basis he finds little evidence to support the view that the eurocurrency markets have led to
a massive expansion of global money supplies. Other authors, such as Duffey and Giddy (1978), have argued
that the eurodollar market is essentially a substitute for the domestic dollar market on both the deposit and
loan side. In the first instance, the deposits they attract are essentially taken away from the US banking system,
while the loans that they make are likewise substitutes for loans by US banks. !is being the case, the idea of
a separate eurodollar multiplier is not a particularly relevant concept.

Hogan and Pearce (1982) have objected to the euromoney markets on other grounds; in particular they

are very concerned about the fact that euromarkets enable deficit countries to finance their deficits with

relative ease and believe the euromarkets encourage excessive borrowing. !ey argue that the rapid growth

- f eurocurrency markets is due to one set of countries being in persistent balance of payments surplus and
another group in persistent deficit. !e eurocurrency markets are viewed as recycling funds from the surplus
countries to the deficit countries; and if the recycling goes on for a number of years the outstanding loans
to deficit countries will grow and grow. Further, deficit countries can avoid the need to pursue prudent
macroeconomic policies. !ey argue that there are a number of dangers that could hit the eurobanking
system. !e deficit countries that have over-borrowed might not wish to repay, which in turn might provoke
a crisis of confidence in the eurobanking system. Another problem might be that depositors with funds in the
system could get concerned at the growing size of eurobanks' exposure to the deficit countries which could
lead them to withdraw their dollar deposits from the eurobanks which in turn could lead to a problem for the
deficit countries that are unable to roll over their loans. Hogan and Pearce are so concerned about the buildup of debt possibilities that they advocate that euromarkets' 'immediate death should be engineered with a
maximum of speed and minimum of fuss' (1982, pp. 127–8).

302

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

It cannot be denied that in the 1970s there was a great deal of recycling of petrodollars by eurobanks to a

number of Latin American countries which had received much of the dollar surpluses of OPEC to finance

their deficits. However, a great deal of the financing of these deficits was also carried out by US domestic banks.

!e fact that much of this lending eventually proved to be unwise (see Chapter 15) is not just a judgement

against much eurobank lending, but also against the lending policies of many domestic US banks. Also, it is

not entirely clear that eurobanks are doing any harm. It must be emphasized that eurobanks ultimately act

as intermediaries for the recycling of funds because they are the most e'cient institutions for doing this. If

they had not been in existence then petrodollar recycling would most probably have still taken place, only less

e'ciently so by the US banking system.

Other authors have argued that eurobanks have enabled speculators to easily raise funds used to mount

speculative attacks on currencies and in so doing have increased currency volatility in general. Against this, it

could be argued that the fact that there are enormous sums of speculative balances on the euromarkets acts as

an important discipline of government macroeconomic policies which leads to more stable macroeconomic

policies and exchange rates.

Despite these concerns, it must be remembered that the eurocurrency markets have increased the range of

facilities available to both borrowers and lenders. In addition, they do so at very competitive rates of interest. !ey

have not only facilitated financial transfers between private economic agents, but also between countries enabling

them to finance current account deficits with somewhat greater ease than before the euromarkets existed.

12.9 EUROMARKETS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND POLICY

While domestic banking has remained subject to various regulatory requirements this is not the case with

euromarkets. Examples of two of the most commonly used regulations governing domestic banking activities

are reserve requirements imposed by the authorities to limit domestic banks' ability to create credit, and

deposit insurance designed to protect depositors should a bank become insolvent.

!e lack of regulation governing eurobanks has o(en led to calls for some degree of international regulation

- f their activities. In particular, given the amount of interbank lending on the euromarkets, there has always
been a fear that were one eurobank to fail this could trigger the failure of many eurobanks. !is being the
case, the need for effective regulation has been regarded as important in ensuring that eurobanks conduct
their business in a sound manner. However, effective regulation of eurobanks is fraught with problems. If the
US authorities were to regulate US eurobanks, all this would be likely to do is to shi( eurobanking activities
to non-US eurobanks. Similarly, if regulation is exercised by a particular eurobanking centre such as London,
then all this would be likely to do is to shi( eurobanking business to other non-regulated centres. Unilateral
regulation by one particular government or eurobanking centre is unlikely to lead to greater regulation of
eurobanking activity because it would most probably just result in a shi( of eurobanking business to other
unregulated eurobanks and centres.

It would seem that effective regulation of eurobanking activities would require multilateral regulation

and guidelines. However, given the high degree of competition for eurobanking business, such multilateral

cooperation is unlikely to be forthcoming. !e very fact that eurobanks have managed to grow rapidly because

- f the lack of regulation of their activities has probably had the effect of reducing the degree of regulation
covering domestic banking activity. Once a regulation is applied to a domestic banking activity, it is o(en the
case that the business is diverted to the eurobanks where it is free of the constraint. Furthermore, the desire
to bring some eurobank business back to the domestic banking arena has o(en acted as a stimulus to the
relaxation of domestic regulations.

International Finance

12.10 THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKET AND THE EUROBOND MARKET

!e international capital market is a longer-term market than the eurocurrency market, in which borrowers

and lenders of funds from different countries are brought together to exchange funds. !e international capital

market is made up of three markets: (1) the domestic bond market, (2) the foreign bond market and (3) the

Eurobond market. A domestic bond is a bond issued in the currency of the country of issue by a domestic

entity; for example, a US dollar Treasury bond issued by the US Treasury or a dollar corporate bond issued

by a US corporation in the United States. A foreign bond is a bond issued by a foreign entity in the domestic

currency of the country of issue. An example of this would be a British company that issues a dollar bond in

the US market – such a foreign bond is known as a Yankee. Other foreign bonds have names symbolizing the

country whose currency is being borrowed, such as Bulldogs for sterling bonds, Samurais for yen bonds and

Matadors for Spanish euro-denominated bonds. A Eurobond is a bond that is sold by a government, institution

- r company in a currency different from the country where the bond is issued. For example, a dollar bond sold
in London is a dollar Eurobond, and a sterling bond sold in Luxembourg is a sterling Eurobond.

Since the early 1960s, the international capital market has grown at an astonishing pace both in terms of

the funds transferred and the number of participants in the market. !e Eurobond market has grown from its

- rigins in the mid-1960s to such an extent that the outstanding value of dollar Eurobonds issued significantly
exceeds the issue of domestic US corporate bonds. !ese days there is no need for securities markets to
be restricted to national boundaries. Economic agents may seek to raise funds in either the domestic or a
foreign currency and in seeking to raise the funds at the cheapest possible cost they may seek the assistance of
foreign financial institutions and foreign financial centres who in turn can attract both domestic and foreign
investors. In the following section, we pay particular attention to the Eurobond market which has become a
particularly significant source of funds.

12.11 THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE EUROBOND MARKET

!e first Eurobond was issued in 1963 and since then the market has grown enormously, particularly during

the 1980s and 1990s. !e Eurobond market dates back to the imposition of the Interest Equalization Tax (IET)

by the US authorities on US citizens that held dollar bonds issued by foreign entities in the United States. !e

US authorities imposed the tax because of concern about the long-term out$ow of capital on the US balance

- f payments. By reducing the attractiveness to US investors of investing in foreign bonds, the tax provided a
stimulus for foreign entities to issue US dollar bonds outside of the United States. A further incentive for the
development of the Eurobond market was that the US authorities also imposed withholding taxes on foreign
citizens that held US bonds, which meant that foreign citizens had a clear incentive to hold Eurobonds that
were not subject to taxation by the US authorities.

Although the IET was abolished in 1974 and withholding taxes removed in 1984, the Eurobond market

continued to prosper. Growth in the 1980s was partly stimulated by the fact that corporations found banks

increasingly reluctant to lend funds due to problems stemming from the debt crisis in the developing world.

Furthermore, many corporations realized that they could exploit their credit ratings, which were o(en as

good if not better than some of the banks that they had traditionally borrowed funds from, especially as they

increasingly deemed the rates of interest and security requirement of banks to be excessive. In addition, many

corporations found that banks were reluctant to lend at fixed rates of interest at the longer time horizons

that corporations were interested in. !e major advantage of a Eurobond issue over domestic and foreign

bond issues is that there are less stringent regulatory and disclosure requirements on the corporate issuer

304

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

and that a greater variety of different bond types can be issued. In summary, the Eurobond market generally

means lower-cost finance for well-known companies than borrowing directly from banks or the domestic

bond market.

12.12 TYPICAL FEATURES OF A EUROBOND

Dollar-denominated Eurobonds have traditionally been the most popular form of issue, although the dollar

predominance is less than in the eurocurrency loans market. In recent years, however, the euro has been

very popular. !e main reason for this is that many corporations have been keen to attract savings from

countries with high savings ratios, especially Japan and Germany, whose investors tend to be more keen to

buy Eurobonds which are denominated in their local currency.

Most (approximately 75%) Eurobond issues are undertaken by very highly rated institutions with AAA and

AA credit ratings. !e market is used extensively by governments, international organizations such as the World

Bank, the European Investment Bank and multinational corporations. Some issuers use the market to raise

funds in currencies they do not wish ultimately to hold but as part of a swap deal (see Chapter 13). !e yield

at which a borrower obtains funds will depend on market conditions and the credit rating of the issuer, with

governments typically being able to raise funds at a lower cost than corporations with an equivalent credit rating.

Eurobonds come in a variety of forms, and the most common type are known as **straights**, which pay fixed

rates of interest with repayment of principal upon maturity. Increasingly popular are **floating-rate notes** which

are Eurobonds on which the interest rate is adjusted every three to six months in line with changes in a key

interest rate such as LIBOR. Floating-rate issues are especially popular with banks that wish to invest surplus

funds, since the $oating rate of interest means that the capital value of the bond is largely unaffected by interest

rate movements. A convertible bond gives the owner the right to convert the bond into ordinary shares in the

issuing company at a predetermined price sometime in the future. Convertible bonds usually pay a belowmarket rate of interest with holders attracted by the potential gain on the possibility of a share price conversion.

Some Eurobonds have a warrant attached that gives the holder the right to buy shares in the company at a

predetermined price in the future; the warrants can be detached from the bond and traded separately.

!e Eurobond market is primarily a medium-term borrowing market with the vast majority of issues

(approximately 80%) being for under ten years with many typically for four to seven years, which contrasts

with the domestic bond market that is generally speaking a longer-term market with most borrowing ranging

from 10 to 30 years. Most Eurobonds are issued at fixed rates of interest and others are issued at $oating rates

- f interest or equity related. Many issues are sold at short notice to take advantage of what are perceived to be
favourable market conditions. Table 12.3 summarizes the typical features of a dollar Eurobond issue.

!e bearer form of most Eurobond issues is a particular attraction for international investors who like to

avoid open registration of their ownership (although they are legally obliged to reveal coupon earnings to

their tax authorities, this may not always happen!). Another attraction of Eurobond issues for investors is that

they are free of withholding taxes and this means that investors can save on paperwork when seeking to avoid

double taxation on their interest income. !e typical Eurobond investor has been characterized as a 'Belgian

dentist', an investor who wishes to earn a little bit more interest than is available on government bonds but who

also wants a very safe investment and is hence attracted by the high credit rating of most Eurobond issuers.

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

12.13 CONTROL AND REGULATION OF THE EUROBOND MARKET

Eurobonds are generally exempt from the rules and regulations that govern the issue of foreign bonds in

a country; for example, the need to issue very detailed prospectuses and withholding taxes (taxes on nonresidents which are deducted at source). However, Eurobond issues and trading do have to meet certain

regulatory requirements, and a self-regulatory body known as the International Securities Market Association

sets the rules and standards.

Despite the fact that the Eurobond market is by definition outside the legal jurisdiction of the country of

the currency of issue, this does not mean that the national authorities of the currency in question are unable

to exert significant in$uence on it. National governments have always exerted control on national capital

markets for a number of reasons; the most important is that they are usually huge borrowers themselves,

they are keen to encourage scarce domestic capital to be invested in domestic bond issues and they are also

concerned about possible tax avoidance and the impact of out$ows of capital on the value of their currency.

Governments still have a number of means of controlling the issue of Eurobonds in their national currencies.

Firstly, most clearance of funds raised in Eurobond issues is done through the clearing system of the domestic

banking system of the currency in question, giving the central bank of that currency the ability to prohibit

issues if it so wishes. Secondly, governments can exert pressure on both domestic investment banks and foreign

investment banks not to participate in Eurobond issues with the implicit threat of losing government business

and ultimately their licence to operate in their country. !e Swiss authorities have effectively prevented

Eurobond issues in Swiss francs, requiring all Swiss franc issues to be done in Switzerland, and the Japanese

have managed to exert strong control over Eurobond issues in yen.

!e US authorities have generally had a concerned but tolerant attitude to the Eurobond market. !e main

concern has been that because Eurobonds are issued in bearer form then the possibility of tax avoidance is

high. Another concern is that the US government is itself a large borrower of funds and to some extent finds

itself in competition with the attractive rates of interest offered on dollar Eurobonds. !e US authorities also

claim that they wish to protect US investors from investment risk due to the looser regulatory and disclosure

requirements. For these reasons, the US authorities prohibit the sale of Eurobonds by investment banks to

US citizens, with the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring US investment banks to take measures

'reasonably designed to preclude distribution or redistribution of the securities, within, or to nationals of, the

United States'. However, there is currently no law preventing US citizens purchasing Eurobonds on their own

initiative, although they would clearly be expected to reveal any coupon earnings in their tax declaration.

!e private placements rule 144A permits sophisticated US financial institutions to hold Eurobonds in their

investment portfolio so long as they are clearly held for investment purposes.

12.14 THE MANAGEMENT OF A EUROBOND ISSUE

A typical Eurobond issue involves the formation of three groups: (i) the management group, (ii) the

underwriting syndicate and (iii) the selling group. !e issue is handled on behalf of a client by a lead or

managing bank, and where the deal involves a particularly large sum of money other co-managers may be

appointed. !e lead manager and co-managers together form the management group. !e borrower and the

lead bank will have initial discussions concerning the currency of issue, the amount and terms at which the

borrower would like to raise funds. !e next stage involves appointing an underwriting syndicate of typically

between 10 and 200 banks/securities houses to underwrite the issue so that the issuer is guaranteed the funds.

!e underwriting group which also includes the banks from the management group has the additional task of

307

International Finance

assisting in the placing of the issue with Eurobond investors. A final group, which comprises the management

group and the underwriting syndicate plus other selected banks, form the selling group whose task is to place

the issue with Eurobond investors.

A typical Eurobond issue is partly placed with institutional investors and partly with private investors, with

the latter usually accounting for around a half of the value of the issue. A few weeks or sometimes days prior

to an issue being placed on the market a 'red herring' prospectus is issued that sets out the likely features of

the bond which is used by the selling group to canvass interest in the issue. In some cases, the bond trades in a

'grey market' which is a short-term forward market that gives prospective investors an opportunity to see the

likely trading range for the market price of the issue. !e selling group, on the basis of feedback from potential

investors, will return to the issuer to 'fine tune' the issue, adjusting the final terms so as to meet some of the

prospective investors' demands. Once the terms of the issue are finalized, the selling group will commit itself

to buying the entire issue at a discount to the offer price and a final prospectus is printed and distributed to

potential investors.

Competition between members of the selling group is fierce and it may well be the case that different investors

are able to buy the bonds at different prices, o(en at a discount to the offer price stated in the prospectus. Lead

managers are expected to ensure, using their own funds if necessary, an orderly primary and secondary market

in the issue; failure to do so would adversely affect their reputation in the Eurobond market. Unlike domestic

bond markets, the secondary market in Eurobonds is relatively 'thin' and most Eurobond investors tend to hold

the issue right through to maturity. Nonetheless, for some of the very large issues with well-known issuers,

the secondary market can be reasonably active, and Eurobond market-makers quote bid–offer prices. !e

bid–offer spread in the Eurobond market can typically range from 30 to 50 basis points, which contrasts with

the spread for US Treasury bonds which, because of the greater liquidity, is typically less than 5 basis points.

!e lead bank and the underwriting syndicate charge the client for both managing, placing and underwriting

the issue. On occasions, the underwriting syndicate will actually purchase part or all of the issue and then

hopefully place it with clients at a higher price and thus make a profit. A typical fee structure involves 20%

- f fees going to the management group, 20% to the underwriting group and 60% to the selling group. !e
fees and precise proportions between the groups are variable depending upon how complex the issue is, the

The Eurocurrency and Eurobond Markets

credit rating of the issuer and how easy the issue is to place with investors. !e total fee as a percentage of the

value of the issue is usually in the range of 0.5 to 2% depending upon the complexity and degree of di'culty

- f placing the issue. Competition for Eurobond business is extremely fierce, particularly as banks are keen to
appear highly placed in the Eurobond league tables, such as the one shown in Table 12.4. In some Eurobond
issues the management group may even confine all three tasks to itself so as to maximize its fee earnings.

12.15 INNOVATIONS IN THE EUROBOND MARKET

!e first Eurobond issues were in the form of 'straights', that is, borrowing at a fixed rate of interest; but the

market has since developed so that many Eurobond issues now have innovative features. !ese days a good

proportion (around a quarter) of Eurobond issues are $oating-rate notes; and another major innovation is

that many recent Eurobond issues are denominated in the euro.

Other innovations include the issue of convertible Eurobonds whereby the investor has the right to convert

the bond into shares in the company at a predetermined price. Some Eurobonds are issued with warrants

attached which can be traded separately, giving the holder the right to buy shares at a predetermined price.

Many Eurobond issues also have a 'call-back' feature which enables the issuer to buy back the issue should it

wish to do so (a particularly useful feature if the borrower's cash $ow turns out to be better than expected or

if interest rates decline su'ciently). More recently, in some Eurobond issues the principal to be returned to

the investor is linked to movements in a broad equity market index such as the Nikkei 225. Another recent

innovation is asset-backed Eurobonds; with these, illiquid assets such as the outstanding loans of a bank are

sold in the form of a Eurobond promising to pay a given coupon based on the income from the outstanding

loans. Such bonds can still have a AAA rating because the bond will typically be over-collateralized, that is,

backed up by loans with a face value considerably higher than that of the bond, so, even if allowance is made

for default on some of the outstanding loans, the Eurobond investor can expect to receive full payment.

In recent years, the Eurobond market has been opened up to governments from so-called emerging markets

such as Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, South Africa, China, Poland and South Korea. Some of the high-risk

countries such as Brazil and Mexico may at times need to pay 500 basis points or more above the equivalent

US Treasury bond rates, while other emerging countries such as China, Poland and South Africa can get away

with borrowing at a spread of 150 basis points or less. In many ways, the Eurobond market has the potential

to provide a valuable source of funding for emerging-market governments, although such borrowers are of a

higher risk than traditional Eurobond borrowers.

All of these innovative features, as well as the fact that interest is paid once a year and that the liquidity of

Eurobonds is lower compared to Treasury bonds, make it quite di'cult to compare the yields on Eurobonds

with standard Treasury and corporate bonds. Nonetheless, a typical Eurobond offers a premium over the

standard Treasury bond of between 30 to 150 basis points depending on the credit rating of the issuer. More

importantly, from the viewpoint of the issuer the typical cost savings of a Eurobond issue compared to a

domestic bond issue can range from 25 to 200 basis points.

12.16 CONCLUSIONS

!e growth of parallel money markets such as the eurocurrency markets has made the process of monetary

control more di'cult for central banks, in stark contrast to the days when they themselves were the main

source of liquidity for banks short of funds. Up to the early 1960s any shortage of liquidity by banks would

309

International Finance

have led to heavy calls for funds in the money market, and the central bank could then charge a high rate

- f interest in its capacity of lender of last resort. !ese days, if banks are short of funds they have plenty of
alternatives other than the central bank, such as the interbank market and the eurocurrency markets. !is
diminishing importance of the central bank is re$ected in the fact that financial institutions increasingly use
LIBOR as the key reference rate of interest, rather than Treasury Bill rates or central-bank lending rates.

Nonetheless, central banks still maintain a very high degree of in$uence over short-term interest rates

through open market operations. Indeed, if a central bank decides to create a general shortage of funds

through large Treasury bill sales this is bound eventually to filter through to the other markets. !e rates of

interest in the eurocurrency and offshore markets are ultimately linked to the domestic markets of the relevant

eurocurrency. For example, if the US Federal Reserve sells Treasury bills, and short-term interest rates rise in

the USA, then eurobanks will find that they need to raise their eurodollar interest rates in order to prevent a

seepage of funds back to the US market. Conversely, if the Federal Reserve conducts an expansionary open

market operation, purchasing Treasury bills and so lowering the US interest rate, there will then be a seepage

- f funds into the euromarkets and eurobanks will find they are able to raise dollar funds at a lower cost, so
lowering the eurodollar rates.

!e growth of eurobanking activity has been blamed for many things, ranging from the breakdown of the

Bretton Woods system, to the rise in worldwide in$ation and the debt crisis in the developing world. In reality,

the eurobanks provide services that are clearly in demand as is verified by their rapid growth. In particular,

their competitive deposit and lending rates prove to be attractive for both investors and borrowers of funds.

Eurobanks have been largely responsible for the increased degree of financial integration between economies

and they perform a particularly important role in recycling funds from surplus to deficit companies and

countries. While this increased financial integration has made monetary control more di'cult for domestic

authorities, it must be concluded that the euromarkets themselves have not had a significant in$ationary

impact upon the world economy. Although a switch from domestic to eurodeposits may free some reserves

for additional lending, the overall effect on liquidity is not particularly significant and is not necessarily

undesirable.

In the end, it is clear that eurobanks have not had a harmful effect on the way economies work, and their

- verall macroeconomic importance has frequently been exaggerated. Many of the transactions carried out
by eurobanks would be undertaken in their absence by domestic banks, only less e'ciently so. Eurobanks
have expanded rapidly partly because the demand for their services has expanded with the increased degree

- f trade among nations. Much of this business has ultimately gone to eurobanks rather than domestic banks
because they have a competitive advantage in the provision of the requisite banking services.

!e Eurobond market is constantly evolving and innovating to meet the changing preferences of both

borrowers and investors of funds. Today, Eurobonds come in a huge variety of different forms, varying in

the credit rating of the issuer, the maturity of the issue, the liquidity of the secondary market, the currency

- f denomination, whether of a fixed or variable rate, and in other specific features. !is makes comparing
different Eurobonds a complex issue. !e bond market is constantly evolving and innovating to meet the
changing preferences of both borrowers and investors of funds. !ese days, with the abolition of exchange
rate controls the domestic capital market is in fierce competition with other markets such as the Eurobond
market to attract scarce international capital. !e Eurobond market has the advantage of lower regulatory
requirements which reduces borrowing costs for issuers and allows for more innovative features to be
introduced compared with a domestic bond issue.

13.1 INTRODUCTION

Since the early 1970s there has been an enormous growth in the use of what is known as derivative instruments.

In this chapter we look at three types of derivative contracts: futures, options and swaps. !e aim of the

chapter is to introduce the reader to the basic features. In particular, we will emphasize how the contracts

can be used for both speculative and hedging purposes and the advantages and disadvantages of the various

contracts. We also look at basic formulae governing the appropriate pricing of futures and options contracts.

International Finance

Standardized financial futures and options contracts are traded on organized exchanges. !ey were first traded

- n the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in the early 1970s, and in 1982 London opened the London
International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) which in 2001 was merged with the Amsterdam, Paris, Belgian
and Lisbon Exchanges and is now called the Intercontinental Exchange - ICE Futures Europe. Since then Euronext
has also merged with the Lisbon Stock Exchange. A significant amount of trading in foreign currency options is
done outside of the major exchanges in what is known as the 'over-the-counter' (OTC) market in which banks and

- ther financial institutions design contracts tailor-made to meet the specific needs of their corporate clients. !e
swaps market is an OTC market with swaps between two parties being arranged on a tailor-made basis.

13.2 THE GROWTH OF DERIVATIVE MARKETS

!e phenomenal growth of trading in these derivative instruments has been one of the most important

developments in international financial markets over the last three decades. !e 1980s witnessed an

astonishing growth of futures and options markets and this trend has continued into the twenty-first century

as shown in Table 13.1.

!ere are numerous reasons for the rapid growth of futures and options markets, which include:

!e volatility of foreign exchange markets following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed

exchange rates (see Chapter 11), combined with the fact that greater freedom of movement of capital

internationally has created a large demand on the part of companies, investors, fund managers and

the like for a means to cope with the greater volatility and risk.

2. Futures and options markets enable traders to take speculative positions on price movements for a

low initial cash payment, known as the initial margin.

Currency Derivatives: Futures, Options and Swaps

3. Futures and options contracts enable traders to take short positions, that is, sell (or have the right

to sell) something they do not own with considerable ease. !is means that taking a position on a

currency depreciation is made as easy as taking a position on currency appreciation.

4. Unlike forward contracts where there is a degree of counterparty risk, all futures and options

contracts are guaranteed by the exchange on which they are traded.

13.3 EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES AND OPTIONS CONTRACTS

Exchange-traded currency futures and options contracts were traditionally sold in a central exchange by an

- pen outcry system. Under this system, traders congregate around a 'pit' on the trading $oor of the exchange,
and contracts are bought and sold at prices within hearing distance of all other traders. Once a contract price
is agreed, the traders fill out trading slips which are then matched by the exchange clearing house. Once the
clearing house confirms the deal, a futures or options contract is in existence and the contract is guaranteed
by the exchange. !is means that if one of the parties fails to fulfil its obligations, then the exchange will
assume the defaulting party's obligations. Effectively the exchange removes counterparty risk; the only credit
risk involved is that of the exchange. !ese days, however, most exchanges are switching to computer-based
trading systems.

One of the major advantages of exchange-traded futures and options contracts is that the exchange

guarantees every contract, thus relieving the gaining party of the risk of default by the losing party and the

need to evaluate the creditworthiness of the counterparty. To limit its exposure, exchange regulations require

that each counterparty to a futures contract and the seller (writer) of an option contract makes an initial

deposit with the exchange known as the 'initial margin' (this is usually between 2 and 10% of the value of the

contract). Once the contract involves a party making a loss greater than the initial margin, further deposits

are required on a daily basis from the losing party, known as the 'variation margin', to re$etc the potential

loss associated with the contract. !e 'marking to market', that is, calculation of variation margins, is carried

- ut at the end of each day on the basis of the settlements price (usually the closing price). !e other party
has its profit position credited to its margin account. Since all potential losses have to be paid for on a daily
basis this limits the exposure of the exchange. In the rare event that a trader were to fail to settle a margin
payment, the exchange has the right to close the trader's position by taking an offsetting contract limiting
its potential exposure to that trader's position. A further means by which the exchange limits its exposure
is that dealing is restricted to members of the exchange who are usually representatives of well-established
financial institutions. !e exchange protects itself by careful selection of authorized traders and by imposing
high membership requirements and standards. !e exchange also constantly monitors members' positions. In
addition, an exchange will maintain a large clearing fund to meet unforeseen circumstances.

13.4 CURRENCY FUTURES AND CURRENCY FORWARDS

A currency futures contract is an agreement between two counterparties to exchange a specified amount

- f two currencies at a given date in the future at a predetermined exchange rate. As such, they are basically
standardized forward contracts of the kind that we examined in Chapter 1. For example, a currency futures
contract may specify &125,000 per contract is being bought or sold. With a forward contract, the amount to
be exchanged is negotiable between the two parties; for example, the two parties can agree to buy/sell, say,
&122,000 forward.

Exchange (CME). !e CME also offers a number of currency contracts, including dollar–Australian dollar

(A\$100,000), dollar–Canadian dollar (C\$100,000), dollar–Mexican peso (500,000 pesos), dollar–sterling

(£62,500) and dollar–yen (¥12.5 million). !e contract specifies the amount of currency to be exchanged, the

exchange on which the contract is traded, the delivery date and the process for delivery.

One party agrees to sell the currency (go short) and the other party agrees to purchase the currency (go

long). Despite their high degree of similarity there are some practical differences between currency forward

and futures contracts – summarized in Table 13.3.

!e main differences are:

1. A currency futures contract is a standardized notional agreement between two counterparties to

exchange a specified amount of currency for another currency at a fixed future date. While in a

forward contract, the amount of currency to be exchanged is determined by the mutual agreement of

the two parties.

2. Futures contracts are traded on an exchange, while forward contracts are OTC instruments with the

exchange being made directly between two parties.

3. Futures contracts are guaranteed by the exchange, whereas forward contracts are not. !e fact that

futures contracts are guaranteed by the exchange on which they are traded removes the counterparty

risk inherent in forward contracts. With a forward contract each counterparty needs to consider

carefully what will happen if the other party is incapable of seeing through its commitment which

may involve quite substantial losses. !is credit risk tends to limit the forward market to only very

high-grade financial and commercial institutions.

4. Futures contracts are generally regarded as having greater liquidity than forward contracts. !eir

standardized nature means that futures contracts can easily be sold to another party at any time

up until maturity at the prevailing futures price with the trader being credited with a profit or loss.

Since forward contract obligations cannot be transferred to a third party they are relatively illiquid

assets. !e only way for a trader to get out of a forward contract is to take out a new offsetting

forward position. For example, if a trader is committed to buying £1 million of sterling forward at

\$1.30/£1, then the only way out of the forward contract is to take out another one to sell £1 million

sterling with another party. !ere are two problems with this: (i) the trader is now exposed to two

counterparties (doubling the counterparty risk); (ii) the maturity date of the second forward contract

may not be perfectly matched with that of the first one. For example, if the original forward contract

is for 90 days, and if 20 days later the trader tries to take an offsetting position, the nearest available

forward contract is 60 days, leaving 10 days of open exposure.

13.5 OPEN INTEREST AND REVERSING TRADES

Two important but linked terms that crop up in connection with futures trades are the open interest in a

contract and the concept of reversing trades. Open interest is the outstanding number of contracts obligated

for delivery. Consider four traders, A, B, C and D, none of whom has any current position in a futures contract.

If trader A takes a long position in a new contract with trader B taking a short position, then the open interest

rises by one contract. Similarly, if trader C takes a long position in a futures contract with trader D taking the

short position, then the open interest rises by a further one contract.

!e commodity or financial asset to be delivered in fulfilment of the contract is known as the **underlying** .

For most futures contracts, especially those that involve physical commodities such as gold and cotton, the

physical delivery of the commodity would be a cumbersome process. To avoid getting involved in the actual

delivery process most traders will therefore enter into what is known as a **reversing trade** prior to the maturity

- f the contract. !at is, they will liquidate their position at the clearing house so that they do not actually have
to deliver or receive the underlying. In our example, traders A and C are committed to buying the underlying
upon expiry, while traders B and D are committed to delivering the underlying currency upon expiry. Trader
A may not actually wish to receive the underlying currency and trader D may not actually wish to deliver the
underlying currency. Hence, at some date prior to expiry, trader A and trader D may take out reversing trades
to liquidate their positions. Trader A will take out a contract to sell the underlying (at the then prevailing
market price). As far as the clearing house is concerned, trader A will have no net position in the futures
market since it has an identical futures contract to both receive and deliver the underlying currency. If trader
A sold his contract to a new party E, then the open interest would have been le( unaffected by A's trade. If,
however, trader A had sold his position to trader D, who was also undertaking a reversing trade, then open
interest would have declined by one since both A and D have effectively negated their positions with the
clearing house.

Figure 13.1 shows the typical profile of open interest on futures contracts, from the day that trading in the

contract is started (contract originates) to the time that the contract expires.

Each contract starts with zero open interest. During the early days of opening, the open interest in the

contract slowly builds up as the number of new contracts increases. Eventually open interest in the contract

peaks, usually when the contract is the near contract. !erea(er, as the expiry date of the contract nears, the

number of traders involved in reversing trades increases so that the open interest rapidly declines until the

expiry date when it falls to zero.

13.6 THE USE OF CURRENCY FUTURES FOR HEDGING PURPOSES

Currency futures can be used both for managing risks and assuming speculative positions. Let us consider a

simple example of how a currency futures contract can be used for hedging purposes.

Numerical Example

**A currency futures contract used for hedging**

Suppose a UK exporter has made export sales to the United States and in six months' time is due to receive

\$1.35 million. !e firm wishes to protect itself and ensure that the sale is profitable when translated back

into UK pounds. !e firm is able to obtain a six-month futures quotation of \$1.35/£1, and because US and

316

Currency Derivatives: Futures, Options and Swaps

UK interest rates at the six-month time horizon are assumed to be equal the spot rate is also \$1.35/£1. !e

exporter is concerned that the pound will appreciate over the next six months to, say, \$1.50/£1 and wishes to

protect himself against the possible adverse currency movement (which would mean his \$1.35 million would

- nly be worth £900,000). !e trader could take out 16 contracts to buy £62,500 at \$1.35/£1 and therefore be
guaranteed £1,000,000 with the \$1,350,000.

Suppose that in six months' time when in receipt of the \$1.35 million the trader has been proved right and

the dollar–sterling parity is \$1.50/£1, and because on expiry the futures price is equal to the then prevailing

spot price, the futures contract is also valued at \$1.50/£1. In these circumstances, the trader will now be in

a position to close his futures contract by selling 16 sterling contracts at \$1.50/£1. !e trader has therefore

closed out his futures contract position at a profit of 15 cents (buying pounds at \$1.35 and selling them at

\$1.50) and his profit from the futures contract is $0.15 * 62,500 * 16 = $150,000. !e hedger therefore has a

total of \$1,350,000 which can be converted at \$1.50/£1, which gives £900,000 and \$150,000 profit from the

futures contract that can be converted spot at \$1.50/£1 to yield £100,000 – and so he obtains a guaranteed £1

million.

Suppose that in six months' time when in receipt of the \$1,350,000 the trader has been proved wrong

and the dollar–sterling parity is \$1.20/£1, and since futures prices equal spot prices on expiration the futures

contract is also valued at \$1.20/£1. In these circumstances, the trader will now be in a position to close his

futures contract by selling 16 sterling contracts at \$1.20/£1. !e trader has therefore closed out his futures

contract position at a loss of 15 cents (buying pounds at \$1.35/£1 and selling them at \$1.20/£1) so his loss

from the futures contracts is –$0.15 * 62,500 * 16 = –$150,000 or £125,000. !e hedger therefore has a total

- f \$1,350,000 le( to be converted at \$1.20/£1 in the spot market giving £1,125,000 less the £125,000 loss on
the futures contract and so obtains a guaranteed £1 million. Either way, whatever the dollar–sterling parity
turns out to be, the futures market has been successfully used for hedging purposes. Indeed, in this example
the hedger has achieved a perfect hedge.

13.7 THE SYMMETRY OF PROFIT/LOSSES ON FUTURES/FORWARD POSITIONS

An important point about currency futures and forward contracts is that the gains or losses of the two parties

engaged in the contract are symmetrical around the difference between the spot price on expiry of the contract

and the futures price at which the contract was taken out. !is is illustrated in Figure 13.2.

In the figure it is assumed that a one-year futures contract is taken out on sterling at a price of \$1.35/£1;

that is, one party has agreed to buy sterling at \$1.35/£1 while the other has agreed to sell sterling at \$1.35/£1.

On the horizontal axis we have the future spot price of sterling in one year’s time. If the spot price of sterling

in one year’s time is above \$1.35/£1 the buyer of the sterling future will have a profit of one cent for every

- ne cent that the future spot price is above \$1.35/£1. For example, if the spot price of sterling on maturity
is \$1.55/£1 then he makes 20 cents per £1 purchased, since he buys the sterling at \$1.35/£1 in fulfilment

- f the futures contract, and can sell each £1 spot for \$1.55/£1. If, however, the future spot price is only
\$1.15/£1, in one year's time he must pay \$1.35/£1 to obtain sterling, which he can only sell at \$1.15/£1, so
incurring a loss of 20 cents. !e gain (or loss) of the buyer of the sterling futures contract is mirrored by the
corresponding)loss (or gain) to the seller of the sterling future. One party to a futures/forward contract is
always likely to lose in the sense that the future spot price will generally be different than the price agreed
in the futures contact.

13.8 THE PRICING OF CURRENCY FUTURES

Since currency futures are very similar to currency forward contracts, it is not surprising that the covered

interest parity (CIP) formula is crucial to the determination of currency futures prices. !e main difference is

that for currency futures they have to be marked to market every day and this needs to be taken into account

when applying the covered interest parity formula. !e appropriate futures price for a dollar per pound parity

is given by equation (13.1) or equivalently by equation (13.2):

F = S× [1+ ][(][r ×T] us [)]

1+ (r ×T)uk

(13.1)

  - r

F = Se [(rus-ruk)T] (13.2)

where F is the futures price in dollars per pound, S is the spot exchange rate in dollars per pound, e is the

natural number 2.71828, _r_ us is the US interest rate, _r_ uk is the UK interest rate, and _T_ is the time le( to maturity

- f the contract, expressed as a fraction of a year.

318

Currency Derivatives: Futures, Options and Swaps

Numerical Example

!e US interest rate is 5% and the UK interest rate is 8%. !e spot dollar sterling rate is \$1.35/£1. !e price of

a six-month (180 days) sterling futures contract which is 100 days into the contract has 80 days to maturity,

which means that _T_ = (180–100)/360 = 0.2222, and the relevant futures price is therefore:

Notice that the pound is at a discount on the futures market, because the holder of sterling benefits from a

higher interest rate. To compensate for the lower interest on holding dollars, the dollar is a forward premium

enabling dollar holdings to be converted back into sterling at a favourable rate in the future. If an investor had

£1,000 he could hold it in the UK and earn 8% for 80 days which becomes £1,017.78. Alternatively, he could

sell pounds spot at \$1.35/£1, obtaining \$1,350 knowing that earning 5% over 80 days this will become \$1,365

and simultaneously he could take out a futures (forward) contract to sell $1,365 at $1.3411/£1 which works

- ut at £1017.78. In other words, the price of the futures contract ensures that there are no arbitrage profits to
be made.

13.9 CURRENCY OPTIONS

Currency options were first traded on the Philadelphia Exchange in the early 1980s, but since then they have

become increasingly popular instruments on other exchanges such as London, Paris and Singapore. In this

and the following sections we explain what a currency option contract is and consider how a currency options

contract can be used for both speculative and hedging purposes. We also discuss the economic role that

- ption contracts can fulfil and emphasize the differences between futures and options contracts.

A currency option is a contract that gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a

currency at a predetermined price sometime in the future. !e currency in which the option is granted is

known as the **underlying currency** . !e currency to be exchanged for the underlying currency is known

as the **counter currency** . If the contract specifies the right to buy &125,000 at \$1.25/&1 then the euro is the

underlying currency and the dollar is the counter currency. An option contract involves two parties, the

**writer** who sells the option and the **holder** who purchases the option. !e holder of an option contract has

the right but not the obligation to either buy or sell the underlying currency at a predetermined exchange

rate in the future. If the option contract gives the holder the right to purchase the underlying currency at a

the owner the right to sell the underlying currency at a predetermined exchange rate to the other party the

contract is known as a **put option** . An option contract that can be exercised any time up until its maturity

date is known as an **American option**, while an option that can only be exercised on the expiration date is

known as a **European option** . !e price at which the underlying currency can be bought or sold is known

as the **strike price** (or **exercise price** ). !e date at which the contract expires is known as the **expiry date** - r

**maturity date** .

!e price paid by the holder to the writer for an option is known as the **option premium** . Table 13.4 shows

various hypothetical call and put option premiums quoted for the dollar–euro exchange rate for 25 May. !e

- ptions traded on this market are American options and can be exercised at any time up to maturity.

Table 13.4 shows the premium measured in US cents for traded currency options of the dollar against the

euro – the spot exchange rate of the dollar against the euro at the close of business on 25 May is \$1.2520/&1.

A)trader can buy a call option (that is, a right to buy euros) at a strike of \$1.2500/&1 expiring in August for

3.00 US cents per euro. For July the same strike price can be bought for 2.40 US cents per euro. Similarly, a put

- ption (right to sell euros) for \$1.25/&1 expiring in August can be bought for 2.68 US cents per euro.

Numerical Example

**Profit/loss profiles for a currency call option**

!e profit and loss profiles for a contract on an August call will depend upon the actual exchange rate

prevailing in August. Let us first consider the profit profile for such a call at a strike price of \$1.2500/&1. If

the future spot exchange rate is less than \$1.2500/&1, then it does not pay the holder to exercise his option

as it is cheaper to buy euros in the spot market and he will lose the premium paid of 3.00 cents per euro

(that is, \$3,750 in total, i.e. 125,000 * \$0.03). If the future spot exchange rate is between \$1.2500/&1 and

\$1.2800/&1 it will pay the holder to exercise the option although a loss will be made of the future spot price

less the strike price and option premium. If the future spot price is above \$1.2800/&1, the call option holder

will make a profit. !e writer of the call option makes a profit or loss that is the mirror image of the profit

and loss profile of the holder. !e profit and loss profile for various exchange rates in August is illustrated in

Table 13.5. !e profit/loss in dollars per contract is found by multiplying the profit or loss per euro by the

contract size of &125,000.

We now proceed to examine with the aid of a couple of examples how the use of options contracts contrasts

with using futures contracts for hedging and speculative purposes.

13.10 A CURRENCY OPTION VERSUS A FORWARD CONTRACT FOR HEDGING

In January a US company orders £1 million of goods from a British company which will be delivered in six

months' time. Upon delivery the goods must be paid for in cash. !e pound has been weak against the dollar

and has depreciated from $1.50/£1 to $1.35/£1 over the last year. !e company feels that the pound is likely to

bounce back (that is, appreciate) and so wishes to protect itself from any appreciation of the pound. !e firm,

however, would like to take advantage of any further strengthening of the US dollar should it occur. !e spot

rate of the pound is \$1.40/£1 while the forward/futures rate is \$1.35/£1. Alternatively, the company can buy a

six-month call option to buy sterling at \$1.35/£1 for 8 cents per pound.

Table 13.6 compares the costs of obtaining the £1 million using an options contract versus a forward

contract. A forward contract will mean he has to give \$1,350,000 regardless of the exchange rate in six months’

time. !e call option will be exercised so long as the dollar/pound is above \$1.35/£1 in six months' time. !e

table also looks at what would happen if the position is le( unhedged and he simply purchases the £1 million

spot in six months at whatever the exchange rate then happens to be.

With the options contract, the position can be hedged for a premium of \$80,000 which will give the holder

the right to buy £1 million at a rate of \$1.35/£1. If the dollar–pound parity is above \$1.35/£1, then the option

will be exercised and the US company will have to pay only \$1,350,000 to obtain £1,000,000 which, given that

the option has cost \$80,000, gives a total cost of \$1,430,000. If the dollar–pound rate is below \$1.35/£1, then

the option contract will not be exercised and the US firm will instead take advantage of the strong dollar to

322

Currency Derivatives: Futures, Options and Swaps

buy pounds spot at the prevailing rate; for example, if the rate is \$1.20/£1 then the firm will obtain £1,000,000

for \$1,200,000 which, given that the option has expired worthless, implies a total cost of \$1,280,000. An

alternative means of hedging would be for the firm to take out a six-month forward contract to buy £1 million

at \$1.35/£1, which means the firm is guaranteed to obtain the required sterling for \$1,350,000 no matter what

the spot rate is in six months' time. Finally, with an unhedged position the firm will have to pay whatever the

spot exchange rate is six months hence.

Overall, Table 13.6 shows very clearly the advantages and disadvantages of hedging using an option or

futures contract. !e option contract enables the firm to fix a maximum payable price but also to take advantage

- f a favourable movement in the exchange rate. !e forward rate provides the firm with full certainty over the
future cost of obtaining £1 million but, unlike the option contract, does not permit the firm to take advantage

- f a favourable movement in the exchange rate. Both futures and options contracts help reduce the risk to the
firm as compared to taking an unhedged position.

13.11 A CURRENCY OPTION VERSUS A FORWARD FOR SPECULATING

Suppose that the spot rate of exchange is \$1.40/£1, while a year ago the rate was \$1.60/£1. A speculator feels

that sterling is likely to appreciate to, say, \$1.60/£1. He has two speculative choices: (i) take out a forward

contract to buy sterling at \$1.35/£1; or (ii) buy a call option on sterling, giving him the right to buy at \$1.35/£1,

the premium of the call being 8 cents. !e profit and loss profile of an \$80,000 open position in options versus

the forward contract is shown in Table 13.7.

In the table a speculator is assumed to have \$80,000 available for speculative purposes and he feels that

the pound is likely to appreciate from $1.40/£1 to $1.60/£1. He could choose between taking out a forward

contract at $1.35/£1 to buy $80,000 of sterling, that is, £59,259.26, or buy an option to purchase £1 million at

\$1.35/£1 for 8 cents per £1. Let us first consider the options contract. An \$80,000 investment gives the right to

purchase £1,000,000 worth of sterling at the rate of \$1.35/£1; that is, \$1,350,0000, at a premium of 8 cents per

pound. If the spot rate in six months’ time is above \$1.35/£1 then the option will be exercised. Suppose that

the speculator is correct and the spot exchange rate on expiry of the contract is \$1.60/£1, then the speculator

will buy £1,000,000 at \$1.35/£1 for a total cost of \$1,350,000 and immediately convert the £1,000,000 back at

\$1.60/£1 to receive \$1,600,000, so leaving a profit of: $1,600,000 – $1,350,000 – \$80,000 (the option premium

paid) =\$170,000. So long as the future spot rate is above \$1.43/£1, so that the 8 cents cost of the option

premium is covered, then the option can be profitably exercised. Between \$1.35 and \$1.43 the option will still

be exercised but an overall loss made. If the rate is below \$1.35 then the option will not be exercised and the

speculator will lose the entire \$80,000 premium.

As an alternative to the options contract, the speculator could take an \$80,000 position in the forward

market, that is, a contract to buy \$80,000/1.35 = £59,259.26 forward. If the speculator is proved right, and

the future spot rate turns out to be \$1.60/£1, then on delivery of the forward contract he will give \$80,000

and receive £59,259.26; he can then immediately sell the £59,259.26 at \$1.60/£1 and receive back \$94,814.81,

implying a profit of $94,814.81– $80,000 = \$14,814.81. For each 1 cent the spot rate in one year’s time is above

\$1.35/£1, he makes a profit of \$592.58, and for each cent the rate is below \$1.35/£1, he makes a loss of \$592.58.

For instance, if the future spot rate is \$1.20/£1 then on delivery of the forward contract he will give \$80,000

and receive £59,259.26 which he can then immediately sell at \$1.20/£1 and receive back only \$71,111.11

implying a loss of: $71,111.11 – $80,000 = –\$8,888.89.

We can see from this example that an option contract offers a very different risk–return profile for speculative

purposes than that offered by the forward/futures contract. !e option contract offers an asymmetric profit

and loss profile; on the one hand, it offers potentially huge gains but with the speculator running the risk of

losing all his \$80,000. !e forward market offers a symmetric and far less dramatic speculative profit/loss

profile.

324

Currency Derivatives: Futures, Options and Swaps

Options contracts can also provide extremely attractive and at times spectacular speculative returns

compared to taking speculative positions in the cash or forward market. However, against this, it must be

borne in mind that many options contracts lapse without being exercised and the speculator thereby risks

losing all of the option premium paid. Also, as we shall see in section 13.15, the more likely an option is to be

exercised the higher will be its premium and the lower the consequent profit profile. One of the features that

makes options so attractive is their asymmetrical profit/loss profile, which means that holders can combine

limited downside losses (the premium paid) with unlimited upside potential profit, which contrasts with the

symmetric profit/loss profile offered by futures/forward contracts. Writing options is a far riskier business

since the potential profit is limited to the option premium, while the potential losses can be very high relative

to the premium received.

13.12 THE ROLE OF OPTION CONTRACTS

Option contracts provide a cheap and $exible way for economic agents to control some significant risks and to

take on highly leveraged speculative financial positions. In other words, options enable risks to be transferred

from one party that wishes to reduce its risk exposure to another party that is willing to take on that risk for

a premium. Like other financial instruments, options attract hedgers, speculators and arbitrageurs. !e basic

motivation for hedgers in dealing with options is to control their risk exposure. By contrast, the motivation for

speculators for dealing in options is the hope of making profits by taking a risky position.

13.13 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OPTIONS AND FUTURES CONTRACTS

Options and futures contracts are both examples of derivative instruments in that their price is derived in

relation to the spot price and in that they can also both be used for hedging and speculative purposes; however,

there are some significant differences in the two contracts. With an option contract the buyer of the option is

not obliged to transact, whereas both parties to a futures contract are obliged. !e other major difference lies,

as our examples illustrate, in the risk–return characteristics of the contract. With a futures contract, for every

cent the future spot price is above the futures rate on expiry of the contract, the buyer makes a cent and the

seller loses a cent on the contract. !is is not the case with an options contract: the maximum loss of the option

holder is limited to the premium paid for the option, which is also the maximum possible gain for the option

writer. However, there is unlimited potential profit for an option holder and likewise unlimited potential loss

for the writer. !is fundamental difference in the risk/return characteristics of futures and options is very

important: futures may be useful instruments for hedging against symmetric risks, while options can prove

useful for hedging against asymmetric risks.

13.14 THE PRICING OF CURRENCY OPTIONS

In this section, we look at the more complex question of option pricing. In particular, we examine the

factors)that determine the price of a currency call option. We first look at these factors from an intuitive

stance)and then proceed to analyse the famous currency option pricing formula which was put forward in

325

International Finance

a paper by Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) which built upon the path-breaking option pricing formula for

shares devised by Black and Scholes (1973).

_The principles of option pricing_

When considering the price of a currency option we need to bear in mind exactly what the buyer of an option

is purchasing. An option offers the purchaser limited downside loss as given by the option premium paid,

combined with unlimited upside potential profit. An option that has no chance of ever being exercised would

be worthless; however, if an option has a high probability of being exercised then one should expect to pay

more for it. A fundamental principle underlying the pricing of an option is that the greater the probability of

an option being exercised the higher will be its premium. !e other key factor that is crucial is the expected

profit if the option were to be exercised.

Bearing these basic principles in mind, let us consider conceptually the factors that are likely to in$uence

the price of a European currency call option using the dollar–pound parity. Payment for a European call

- ption on sterling gives the buyer the right to buy sterling at a predetermined rate at a given date in the future.
!ere are six crucial factors that determine the likelihood of a currency call option being exercised, and that
hence in$uence the price to be paid for the call option:

1. !e **spot exchange rate** : the higher spot price of sterling (dollars per pound) the more likely the

	- ption is to be exercised for any given strike price and consequently the higher the price of a call
	- ption.

2. !e **strike price** : the higher the strike price of a call option on sterling (dollars per pound) the less

likely it is that it will be exercised for a given spot rate and hence the lower its price.

3. !e **time le% to expiry** : the longer the time le( to expiry then the more the chance of the option

being exercised and hence the higher its price.

4. !e **volatility** : the more volatile the dollar–sterling parity the more likely that its price at the time of

expiry will exceed the strike price and hence the higher the price of the option.

5. !e **underlying currency (£) interest rate** : the purchaser of a sterling option is paying the issuer

dollar cash for an option that can be exercised to buy a given amount of sterling in the future.

!e option holder pays the premium in dollars, forgoing the US interest rate on the dollar option

premium, but in return acquiring a right to obtain sterling in the future rather than spot. A rise in

the UK interest rate makes holding sterling today more attractive and therefore the call option less

attractive since one is forgoing more sterling interest. For this reason, other things being equal, a call

    - ption premium on sterling needs to be lower as the UK interest rate becomes higher.

6. !e **counter currency ($) interest rate** : the purchaser of a sterling option is paying the issuer dollar

cash for an option which can be exercised to buy a given amount of sterling in the future. !e option

holder that pays the premium in dollars is able to keep far more of his funds in dollars than if he had

to buy the pounds spot for a relatively small dollar premium. Hence, a rise in the US interest rate

makes the call option more attractive. For this reason, other things being equal, the premium for a

call option on sterling needs to increase as the US interest rate rises.

Table 13.8 summarizes the relationship between each of these six determinants of a currency call option.

|Domestic interest rate||
|Foreign interest rate||

13.15 INTRINSIC VALUE AND TIME VALUE

An option premium is made up of two components: the **intrinsic value** and the **time value** . !e intrinsic

value is the gain that would be realized if an option was exercised immediately, which for a currency call

- ption is simply the currency spot rate less the strike price of the underlying currency. For a put option it is
the strike price less the spot price of the underlying currency:

                 Intrinsic value for a call option = spot price strike price

                  Intrinsic value for a put option = strike price spot price

If an intrinsic value for an option exists, then the option is said to be **in-the-money** . For a call option, if the

strike price is below the cash price it will have an intrinsic value and is therefore in-the-money. If the strike

price is above the cash price the call option will have zero intrinsic value and is said to be **out-of-the-money** .

If the strike price is equal to the spot price the asset is **at-the-money** with zero intrinsic value. Table 13.9

summarizes the various possible states for both call and put option contracts. !e intrinsic value re$ects the

price that would be received if the option were 'locked in' today at the current market price. !e intrinsic value

- f an option is either positive or zero.

!e **time value**  - f an option is the option premium less the intrinsic value, and re$ects the fact that an

- ption may have more ultimate value than its intrinsic value:

Time value = option premium – intrinsic value

An option buyer, even if the option is out-of-the-money, will still have some hope that at some time prior

to expiry, changes in the spot price will move the option into the money or further increase the value of the

- ption if it is already in-the-money. !is prospect gives an option a value greater than its intrinsic value.

**Table 13.9** In-the-money, at-the-money and out-of-the-money

|Col1|Call|Put|
|---|---|---|
|In-the-money|Spot rate above strikeprice|Spot rate below strikeprice|
|At-the-money|Spot rate equals strikeprice|Spot rate equals strikeprice|
|Out-of-the-money|Spot rate below strike price|Spot rate above strike price|

Numerical Example

**Intrinsic and time value**

Example 1

Consider a call option valued at 8 cents to buy sterling at \$1.35/£1 with the spot exchange rate of sterling at

\$1.40/£1. !e option is in-the-money to the tune of 5 cents and so has an intrinsic value of 5 cents; the other

3 cents represents the time value.

Example 2

Consider a call option valued at 3 cents to buy sterling at \$1.35/£1 with the spot price of sterling at \$1.30/£1.

!e option is out-of-the-money to the tune of 5 cents and so has no intrinsic value; the whole value of the

- ption, that is 3 cents, is the time value.

13.16 THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OPTION PREMIUM BETWEEN TIME AND

INTRINSIC VALUE

One of the crucial assumptions underlying the theory of currency option pricing is that the natural logarithm

- f the spot exchange rate is normally distributed; that is, it follows a log-normal distribution. A variable that
has a log-normal distribution can have any value between zero and infinity as shown in Figure 13.3.

!e time value for a given expiry date will get closer to zero the more in-the-money or out-of-the-money

the contract is. !is idea is illustrated in Figure 13.4 that shows the various probability factors behind the

Probability

intrinsic and time-value components of an option. !ere is a log-normal distribution around the spot price

such that the spot price may go up or down by a given amount with equal probability; however, the larger the

move in any direction the smaller the probability.

Figure 13.4(a) shows a deep in-the-money option, with the spot rate _S_ exceeding the exercise rate _X_ . !is

there is also a lot of intrinsic value that could easily be reduced or even lost entirely if the exchange rate of the

underlying currency were to depreciate (fall), which means that the time value is given by the potential upside

area minus the potential loss of the intrinsic value, which is quite high, leaving a small amount of time value.

Figure 13.4(b) shows a slightly in-the-money option, with the spot rate exceeding the exercise rate. !e

underlying currency option has a roughly 50% chance of appreciating (rising) further, giving good upside

potential; however, there is a lower intrinsic value that could be wiped out or reduced than in the case of

Figure 13.4(a), so the time value which is given by the potential upside area minus the potential loss of the

intrinsic value is higher due to the lower intrinsic value.

Figure 13.4(c) shows an at-the-money option, with the spot rate equal to the exercise rate. !e time value

- f the option is at its maximum, re$ecting that any appreciation (rise) of the underlying currency will place
the option in-the-money, while there is no intrinsic value to be lost.

Figure 13.4(d) shows a slightly out-of-the-money option, with the spot rate slightly below the exercise rate.

!e option has no intrinsic value but there is a good chance, although less than in Figure 13.4(c), that the spot

rate may appreciate and so exceed the exercise rate prior to maturity. For this reason, the option will have a

lower time value than in Figure 13.4(c) other things being equal.

Figure 13.4(e) shows a deep out-of-the-money option, with the spot rate well below the exercise rate.

!e option has no intrinsic value and there is only a relatively small chance that the spot rate will appreciate

330

Currency Derivatives: Futures, Options and Swaps

su'ciently to exceed the exercise rate prior to maturity. For this reason, the option has only a small time value

which is lower than in the case of Figure 13.4(d) other things being equal.

An important point shown by Figure 13.4 is that the value of the option falls, other things being equal (that

is, for a given exercise price, volatility, risk-free rate of interest and term to maturity), as we move from **a** to **e**

since the probability of the option being exercised, that is, the area to the right of the exercise rate, decreases.

Figure 13.5 shows the distribution of the total option premium between time value and intrinsic value for

a variety of spot exchange rates ( _S_ 1, _S_ 2, _S_ 3, _S_ 4 and _S_ 5), other things being equal, and a given strike price ( _X_ ).

A)deep out-of-the-money option with price _S_ 1 has zero intrinsic value and a small amount of time value. If the

spot exchange rate were higher at _S_ 2, so that the option is only slightly out-of-the-money, the option premium

has zero intrinsic value but more time value, re$ecting the greater probability of being exercised than at _S_ 1.

When the spot price _S_ 3 is equal to the exercise price, that is, the contract is at-the-money, the entire premium is

made of the time value which is at its maximum. Above the exercise price, the option premium starts to have a

positive intrinsic component which increases by 1 unit for each 1 unit the spot price exceeds the exercise price;

however, the time value starts to fall because although there is further upside potential there is the risk that

some (or all) intrinsic value can be lost, so at _S_ 4 the time value is smaller than at _S_ 3 although the total option

premium is higher. At the spot price _S_ 5 the option is deep in-the-money with a large component of intrinsic

value and continued upside potential and only a slight risk that the option will end up worthless – and this is

re$ected in a small amount of time value. !e lesson is that the more in-the-money the contract, the greater

the probability that the option holder will be able to exercise the contract and therefore the lower the time value

- n the contract. Similarly, the more out-of-the-money the contract, the greater the probability that the contract
will not be exercised and therefore the lower its time value. Table 13.10 summarizes the division of the option
premium between intrinsic and time value for various option statuses and the reason for the time value.

13.17 THE GARMAN AND KOHLHAGEN OPTION-PRICING FORMULA

In this section we outline the Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) formula for the pricing of currency options.

!e formula applies to European currency options, and for the purpose of our analysis we will deal with the

pricing of a call option. We will make the following assumptions:

1. !e option is a European option; that is, it cannot be exercised prior to maturity;
2. !e underlying currency interest rate ( _r_ uk) and counter-currency interest rates ( _r_ us) are fixed during

the life of the option;

3. !e foreign exchange markets are perfectly e'cient with zero transactions costs, no bid–ask spread

and no taxes;

4. !e exchange rate is log-normally distributed, with a constant mean and standard deviation;
5. It is possible to short sell the currency and utilize the proceeds obtained without restriction;
6. !e spot rate of the currency moves in a continuous fashion.

!e Garman and Kohlhagen formula for the pricing of a call option is given by the formula:

_C_             - _S_ e� _rukT_ _N d_             - 1�             - _X_ e� _rusT_ _N d_             - 2� (13.3)

!e _d_ 1 and _d_ 2 terms are given by:

_d_ 1               - 1 _n S X_ ( / ) [� _rus_               - _ruk_               -               - 2 / ]T2

and:

_d_ 2                   - _d_ 1�� _T_

where _C_ is the call premium (measured in cents), _S_ is the spot exchange rate (measured in dollars per pound),

_X_ is the exercise price (measured in dollars per pound), e is the natural number 2.7182, _rus_ is the risk-free

interest rate of the United States, _ruk_ is the risk-free interest in the United Kingdom, _T_ is the time le( to

maturity (expressed as a fraction of a year), + [2] is the variance of the spot rate on an annual basis, and + is the

standard deviation of the spot rate on an annual basis.

Currency Derivatives: Futures, Options and Swaps

!e essential meaning of equation (13.3) is that the value of the call today is the present value of the expected

value of the option upon expiry. !e expected value involves use of the cumulative normal distribution tables;

essentially _S_ e [–] _[rukT]_ _N_ ( _d_ 1) is the expected present value of the spot rate upon expiry (using the underlying

currency interest rate); while the term _X_ e [–] _[rusT]_ _N_ ( _d_ 2) is the present value of the strike price on expiry (using the

counter-currency interest rate).

_Interpretation of the_ N _(_ d _1) and_ N _(_ d _2) terms_

!e _N_ ( _d_ 1) and _N_ ( _d_ 2) terms involving the cumulative probability function are the terms which take into

account the risk of the option being exercised. !e _N_ ( _d_ 1) term re$ects the cumulative probability relating

to the spot exchange rate, and its value shows the amount by which the option premium increases for each 1

cent rise in the dollar–pound exchange rate. !e value of _N_ ( _d_ 1) lies between 0 and 1. If the spot rate is deeply

- ut-of-the-money (e.g. Figure 13.4(e)) then a 1 cent appreciation of the pound will have little effect on the
call premium since it remains unlikely the option will be exercised, so that _N_ ( _d_ 1) will be low, for example
0.2. If the option is currently at-the-money, then there is a 50% chance it will end up in-the-money and a
50% chance it will end up out-of-the-money, so that _N_ ( _d_ 1) will be 0.5 (Figure 13.4(c)); that is, if the pound
appreciates by 1 cent, then the call premium will rise by 0.5 cents. If the option is already deep in-the-money,
each 1 cent appreciation in the pound will be increasingly re$ected in the call premium on the pound so that
_N_ ( _d_ 1) will get closer to 1 (Figure 13.4(a)), for example 0.9. !e greater the spot appreciation of the pound in
relation to the exercise rate, the higher the value of _N_ ( _d_ 1).

!e _N_ ( _d_ 2) term re$ects the cumulative probability relating to the exercise rate; that is, _N_ ( _d_ 2) is the

probability that the call option will actually be exercised, which is represented by the area to the right of the

exercise rate in Figures 13.4(a) to 13.4(e). If _N_ ( _d_ 2) is 0.60 then there is a 60% chance that the option will be

exercised. !e value of _N_ ( _d_ 1) is always greater than _N_ ( _d_ 2) except in the limiting case where the option is

certain to be exercised, in which case _N_ ( _d_ 1) = _N_ ( _d_ 2) = 1.

13.18 A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE OF THE GARMAN–KOHLHAGEN FORMULA

Let us consider the dollar premium that is payable for a currency call option on sterling. Assume that the

current spot rate is \$1.40/£1 and an investor buys a call option to purchase sterling at a strike price of \$1.35/£1.

!e US interest rate is 6% and the UK interest rate is 9%, and the standard deviation (+) is 20% (expressed as

0.20 in the formula). !e option has 180 days to expiry, so that:

_S_ = \$1.40/£1

_X_ = \$1.35/£1

_r_ = 0.06

_us_

_r_ = 0.09

_uk_

_T_ = 0.5 (approx.)

+ = 0.20 (20%) so that + [2] = 0.04

_d_ 1:

We first calculate the value of

_d_ 1 - 

0 22.

From the cumulative normal distribution of Table 13.14, supplied in the Appendix at the end of this chapter,

we find:

_N_ ( _d_ 1) = _N_ (0.22) = 0.5871

Note that if the value we find for _N_ ( _d_ 1) or _N_ ( _d_ 2) is negative, then when we look up the value in Table 13.14

we must subtract the value we find in the table from 1. For example, in the table we need to look up the value

_N_ ( _d_ 1) = –0.035 (this is the value we would get if the spot rate was \$1.35/£1 instead of \$1.40/£1). First, we look

up 0.035 in the table, which gives 0.5140 (midway between 0.5120 and 0.5160); we then subtract this from 1,

so that _N_ ( _d_ 1) = _N_ (–0.035) is given by 1–0.5140 = 0.486. For positive values of _N_ ( _d_ 1) and _N_ ( _d_ 2) we just use the

value listed in the table.

We next calculate the value of _d_ 2, repeating equation (13.5):

_d_ 2                   - _d_ 1�� _T_

that is,

_d_ 2                 - 0 22.                 - 0 2 0 5. .                 - 0 08.

From the cumulative normal distribution (see Table 13.14 supplied at the end of the chapter) we find:

_N d_              - 2�              - _N_              - 0 08.              -              - 0 5319.

With these calculations we are now in a position to calculate the price of the option:

_C_             - _S_ e [�] _rukT_ _N d_             - 1�             - _Xe_ _[-rusT]_ _N d_             - 2�

Substituting the appropriate values yields:

_C_       - 1.40       - 2.7182�0.09 0.5�       -       -       - 0.5871�       - 1.35       - 2.7182�0.06 0.5� **�**       - 0.5319�       
		- 0.0896, that is 8.96 cents

Since the spot rate \$1.40/£1 exceeds the strike price \$1.35/£1, then, of the 8.96 premium, 5 cents is intrinsic

value and 3.96 cents is time value. !e above calculations are based upon a spot exchange rate of \$1.40/£1 and

a strike price of \$1.35/£1. Table 13.11 shows how the values of _N_ ( _d_ 1) and _N_ ( _d_ 2) change as the value of the

current share price changes and the resulting call price in pence.

!e intrinsic value of an option is easily calculated as is the time le( to expiration. !e underlying and

counter-currency risk-free interest rates are all measurable, and the most contentious thing to measure is

volatility. Ideally, the e'cient pricing of options requires a measurement of volatility likely to occur in the

future. **Historical volatility** may be a useful measure for this purpose, but it could prove to be defective

as the past is not necessarily a good guide to the future. In addition, an appropriate measure of historical

volatility is still needed; should it be based on the last month's exchange rate volatility, the last three months,

the last six months or last year? Another problem with historical volatility is that it usually fails to pick up

the possibility of large discrete shi(s. **Expected volatility** will differ from one market participant to another,

and therefore the view of the appropriate market price of an option will vary between market participants.

**Implied volatility** is the volatility implicit in the current option price, found by taking the current price of

the option and finding a volatility that when plugged into the option pricing formula gives the current market

price of the option (this is easily calculated by a spreadsheet).

13.19 PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENCY OPTION-PRICING FORMULA

!e formula we have looked at is only applicable to European options – American options are usually

priced slightly higher than European ones because of the extra advantage that they give to the holder

- f being able to exercise the option at any date prior to maturity. Another problem is that the formula
assumes that the log of the exchange rate follows a log-normal distribution. In the real world exchange
rate distributions tend to be leptokurtic, that is, to have fatter tails than a normal distribution, meaning
that there are better chances of an option being exercised than suggested by the standard currency optionpricing formula. Hence, real-world option premiums tend to exceed the theoretical price derived from the
Garman–Kohlhagen formula.

13.20 THE OTC MARKET IN OPTIONS

Major international banks have for many years marketed the advantages and $exibility of currency options

to their multinational corporates and other clients. Since multinational corporations have varied demands,

not all of which can be matched by exchanges, banks have found it worthwhile to offer tailor-made options

contracts to meet the specific needs of their clients. !is tailor-made market which allows for negotiation

- f the terms of the contract between the writer and holder of an option is known as the over-the-counter
market (OTC). !e OTC market is dominated by major banks and securities houses, which contrasts with the

335

International Finance

standardized contracts on offer at various exchanges. !e major advantage of the OTC market is that a client's

specific needs with regard to the size, exercise price and expiry date of the contract can be met. However, there

are also a number of disadvantages of the OTC market: (i) the relatively small number of buyers and sellers

means that the contract could be mispriced; (ii) the lack of standardization of the contracts in the OTC market

means that the secondary market for OTC contracts is severely limited, so OTC instruments lack the liquidity

that is a vital part of exchange-traded options; and (iii) the holder of the option runs the risk of default on

the part of the writer, whereas exchange-traded options are guaranteed by the exchange. For this reason, only

high-quality financial institutions tend to be involved in the OTC market.

13.21 THE SWAPS MARKET

A swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange two differing forms of payment obligations, and

there are basically two types of swaps: (i) interest rate swaps and (ii) currency swaps. In an interest rate swap,

the exchange involves payments denominated in the same currency, while in a currency swap the exchange

involves two different currencies.

!e first well-documented currency swap involved the World Bank and International Business Machines

(IBM) in 1981, in which the World Bank committed itself to financing some of IBM's Deutschmark/Swiss

franc debt in return for a commitment by IBM to finance some of the World Bank's dollar debt. Since the early

1980s there has been an enormous growth in the swap market. Table 13.12 shows the value of currency swaps

for the period 2000–2020.

Like many other financial instruments, swap agreements are used to manage risk exposure; however, as

we shall see, one of the main reasons for the rapid growth of the swap market has been that they enable

parties to raise funds more cheaply than would otherwise be the case. !e swap market is used extensively

by major corporations, international financial institutions and governments and is an important part of the

international bond market. !e swap market is currently organized by the International Swap and Derivatives

Association (ISDA) which since 1985 has been responsible for standardizing documentation and dealing

terms in the swap market.

13.22 POTENTIAL CURRENCY SWAP SCENARIOS

We shall first consider a few scenarios where companies might use the currency swap market.

_Scenario 1: reducing the cost of raising finance_

A currency swap might prove attractive for two companies that have differing abilities to raise funds in

different markets. A Chinese company might wish to raise dollar funds at a $oating rate of interest, while a

US company might wish to raise yen at a fixed rate of interest. It might be the case that Japanese investors are

not too keen on US companies but are keen to invest in Chinese companies, while US investors are not too

keen to lend to Chinese companies. In such circumstances, there may be a swap opportunity with the Chinese

company raising yen funds at a fixed rate of interest, while the US company raises dollar funds at a $oating

rate of interest; the companies then swap the funds raised and the corresponding obligations. !e net result

is that the Chinese company gets the dollar funds it needs at a fixed rate of interest cheaper than it could have

raised the funds itself, while the US company would get the fixed rate yen funds at a cheaper cost than if it had

raised the funds itself.

_Scenario 2: changing debt structures on a balance sheet_

Company A has a lot of dollar-denominated debt on the liability side of its balance sheet and would like to

switch some of this into sterling debt. Meanwhile company B has a lot of sterling debt on its books and would

like to switch some of this into dollar debt. Rather than each company going through the costly process of

buying back its debt and then issuing new debt in its preferred currency, the companies could negotiate a

swap agreement whereby they exchange their debt and the corresponding obligations. In the end, company A

finances part of company B's sterling debt while company B finances part of company A's dollar debt.

Having looked at some potential swap scenarios, we now proceed to examine some specific numerical

examples of currency swaps. To concentrate on the basic issues we shall ignore charges by an intermediary for

arranging the swap.

**Table 13.13** A currency swap

13.23 A CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENT

In a currency swap, differing currencies are involved. Consider the following scenario of two companies, one

a British company wishing to raise \$135 million for ten years at a $oating rate of interest for investment in the

United States, the other a German company that wishes to raise £100 million for ten years at a fixed rate of

interest for investment in the United Kingdom. We assume that the spot exchange rate is \$1.35/£1.

!e UK company can borrow \$135 million at a $oating rate of interest though it is advised that it will

have to pay dollar LIBOR + 0.75%, its repayments being adjusted annually in line with changes in LIBOR.

!e German company could borrow £100 million of funds directly at a fixed rate of interest of 8.50%. A swap

dealer that has both these clients on its books may spot a swap opportunity. !e dealer knows that market

conditions would permit the UK company to borrow £100 million on the London market at a fixed rate of

interest of 8%, while a current US investment bias for German companies would enable the German company

to borrow \$135 million at LIBOR + 0.25%. !e borrowing opportunities open to the two companies are

shown in Table 13.13.

If they were to exchange debt obligations, the UK company would be able to gain dollar finance at LIBOR +

0.25%, saving 50 basis points, while the German company would be able to gain sterling finance at 8%, saving

50 basis points. !e mechanics of the currency swap can be summarized using swap boxes as in Figure 13.6.

Figure 13.6 first indicates the position of each company without a swap. !e UK company would raise

\$135 million in the USA at a $oating rate of interest 75 basis points over LIBOR. !e German company would

raise £100 million at a fixed rate of interest of 8.5%. As a prelude to the swap, since the UK company can raise

sterling fixed rate funds in the UK market cheaper than the German company, it will issue £100 million at

a fixed rate of interest of 8% (straight arrow for fixed), while the German company will raise \$135 million

in the USA at a $oating rate of interest of LIBOR + 0.25% (squiggly arrow for $oating). We then have the

initial exchange of principal: the UK company gives the German company the £100 million while the German

company gives the UK company the \$135 million it requires (a fair exchange at the \$1.35/£1 parity). Next we

have the periodic exchange of interest payments by the two companies: the UK company pays dollar LIBOR +

0.25% to the German company which is used to repay holders of its bonds, while the German company pays

the UK company 8% sterling which is used to pay its bond holders. A(er ten years we have the final exchange

- f principal: the UK company pays the German company \$135 million so that it can pay back its US bond
holders upon maturity, while the German company will pay the UK company £100 million so that it can pay
its UK bond holders upon maturity.

In effect the currency swap has enabled the UK company to raise the \$135 million it required at dollar

LIBOR + 0.25%, thus saving itself 50 basis points (or \$675,000 per year) over what it would cost to raise

the funds itself in the USA. !e German company manages to raise the £100 million it requires at 8.0%,

thus saving itself 0.5% (or £500,000 per year) over what it would cost to raise the funds itself in the United

Kingdom. Strictly speaking the initial and final exchange of principal is unnecessary since the UK company

could convert the £100 million it raises at the spot rate of \$1.35/£1 into the \$135 million it needs, and the

German company convert the \$135 million it raises into £100 million. !e main feature of the swap is the

interest rate exchange.

Effectively the swap arrangement exploits an arbitrage opportunity enabling the UK company to obtain US

funds at the same rate as the German company, and the German company the opportunity to raise funds at a

similar cost to the UK company. Prior to the development of swap markets such arbitrage opportunities were

undertaken by hedging the position in the forward exchange market. !e UK company would raise funds at

$oating rates of interest in the UK, convert these into dollars and then use the forward exchange rate to hedge

the foreign exchange risk. However, most forward markets for foreign exchange are for less than two years. In

- rder to hedge a ten-year position each party would have to take out an annual forward contract for each of
the next ten years. Furthermore, the forward rate contract it takes out may still not be ideal if the forward rate
is moving against the company. With the swap agreement each party is achieving a perfect ten-year hedge in

- ne contract.

13.24 DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SWAP MARKET FROM THE FORWARD

AND FUTURES MARKETS

A swap agreement is basically the same as a forward/futures contract in that both parties are committing

themselves to a stream of future obligations just as participants do in a forward/futures contract. Although a

swap is basically a forward contract, there are nonetheless significant differences between exchange-traded

futures contracts and the obligations entered into in a swap contract. !e most obvious difference is that

exchange-traded futures contracts are of a much shorter duration than the vast majority of swap contracts.

While most futures contracts are usually for a year or less, most swap contracts cover periods ranging from

5 to 20 years and possibly longer. !is factor is particularly important in explaining the popularity of swap

contracts to business: swaps offer hedging possibilities that meet the longer time frame within which many

businesses have debt obligations.

Futures contracts are also highly standardized contracts that may not meet the specific needs of a firm

because of their limited time horizon and few fixed expiry dates each year. By contrast, with a swap agreement

a party is able to obtain a highly specific agreement with a time horizon and payment schedule closely matched

to its needs.

Another significant difference between futures and swaps is that futures contracts are highly regulated

contracts that come under the control of the relevant futures exchange. A significant advantage of futures

contracts is that the exchange will guarantee the obligations should one of the parties default on its

- bligations. By contrast, the swap market is less regulated and unless the counterparties ensure the agreement
is underwritten by a third party there is the risk that one of the parties will not fulfil its obligations.

A significant advantage of futures contracts over swaps is that there is an active secondary market in futures

contracts, so that obligations can easily be terminated by selling the contract to another party. By contrast,

swap agreements, because of their non-standardized nature, have a far less active secondary market, and a

swap agreement can only be cancelled with the consent of both parties. A party that wishes to end its swap

- bligations will either have to enter a swap buy-back, a swap sale or swap reversal with another counterparty
that reverses (as closely as is possible) the cash $ows inherent in its original swap agreement.

13.25 CONCLUSIONS

In recent years currency derivatives have become one of the most important tools for risk management.

Properly used, they can be useful tools to reduce the foreign exchange risk and offer an attractive alternative to

the traditional forward market. Futures contracts are basically very similar instruments to forward contracts

but have some distinguishing features which can give them an edge over the use of forward contracts in

many circumstances. !e key to the successful use of currency futures contracts for hedging purposes is that

the adverse implications of any change in the spot market is offset by a profit from an appropriate futures

contract. A currency futures contract enables a firm to hedge against exchange rate risk by buying (selling) a

340

Currency Derivatives: Futures, Options and Swaps

futures contract at a guaranteed exchange rate in the future regardless of what the corresponding future spot

exchange rate turns out to be. !e present range of currency futures contracts means that the exchange rate

risk facing companies and fund managers of adverse movements in currencies can generally be considerably

reduced or even eliminated, at least up to the 12-month horizon. In addition to hedging, futures contracts are

useful instruments for taking speculative positions. For example, if a speculator feels that a currency is likely

to depreciate compared to the futures rate it is remarkably easy to take out a short position. !e low margin

requirements also make speculation relatively easy.

Option contracts offer a different payoff profile to futures contracts and as such provide a very useful

hedging/speculative alternative to forward and futures contracts. !e options market is now established as

- ne of the most important growth areas of financial markets. Currency options can help investors to hedge
positions at relatively low cost and may prove more suited to hedgers' needs than futures contracts. While
buying a futures contract guarantees the price to be paid in the future, regardless of what the corresponding
future spot price turns out to be, hedging with a futures contract means that the investor also gives up the

- pportunity to benefit from a favourable price movement. It is here that options contracts can provide an
important alternative because by hedging with an options contract the hedger can ensure a maximum price to
be paid in the future and yet still be able to take advantage of a favourable exchange rate movement. Properly
used, options contracts are extremely useful hedging tools. !e symmetric risks involved in forwards and
futures contracts contrasts with the asymmetric risks of options contracts. For this reason, options tend to
be more costly hedging instruments to purchase: to induce a party to write an option the purchaser must be
prepared to pay a fee that re$ects the increased exposure to the writer.

Another attractive feature of options is that they can be combined with other options, futures and spot

positions to devise numerous innovative speculative and hedging strategies. Overall, therefore, option contracts

enable investors, hedgers and speculators to take positions more akin to their risk–return preferences.

Swap contracts can enable firms to obtain long-term finance at a lower cost than would otherwise be the

case and can also be used to hedge longer-term currency risk at time horizons greater than available by the

use of traditional forward markets. !e swap market has grown enormously since the first swaps took place

in the early 1980s, so that in 2020 the outstanding gross notional principal amount of currency swaps was

estimated by the Bank for International Settlements to be around \$27,809 billion. !e market has matured so

much that the potential gains to be had from swaps has fallen from around 50 basis points to more like 5 to 10

basis points. !e development of the swap market has been one of the most significant developments in the

bond market, since it has enabled firms to obtain lower-cost financing and also to hedge risks at far longerterm horizons than is possible with futures and options.

Arranging swaps and even becoming a counterparty to swap arrangements has generated a source of fee

income for banks but it has also meant that they have had to adopt new risk-management techniques and

procedures. Underwriting a swap deal involves some 'off-balance-sheet' exposure for a bank should one of

the counterparties default on its obligations. Hence, a bank needs to keep a careful eye on its potential swap

exposures and the creditworthiness of the parties with whom it deals.

It should also be remembered that the swap contracts examined in this chapter have been major

simplifications of actual swaps carried out in the real world. In practice, swap agreements involve more

complexity in that the two swap parties may wish to exchange different notional principal amounts, have

different payment dates, and in the case of currency swaps an intermediary has to take into account different

interest rate conventions, such as different day counts used in different countries.

14.1 INTRODUCTION

For the majority of this text, we have confined our analysis to the study of a small open economy. By definition

the policy measures taken by such an economy have no significant impact upon its trading partners. !e small

economy assumption is useful in that it makes it plausible to ignore possible reactions to its policies from

trading partners. In the real world, however, the actions taken by one country will o(en have significant effects

upon its trading partners. !is means that the countries are interdependent and policy measures adopted by

- ne of the economies may provoke a reaction from its trading partners that can reinforce, weaken or even
- ffset its policy. Where such interdependence exists it is frequently argued that countries should consider
coordinating their macroeconomic policies to avert the possibility of con$ict and improve their positions as
compared to pursuing unilateral policies.

In this chapter, we shall look at some of the major issues raised by the topic of international macroeconomic

policy coordination. !ese issues include: what is meant by coordination of economic policies? Why does the

need for international policy coordination arise? Is coordination always superior to non-coordination? What

are the obstacles that prevent greater international coordination?

14.2 WHAT IS MEANT BY INTERNATIONAL POLICY COORDINATION?

'International policy coordination' is a very loose term and is sometimes used interchangeably with the word

cooperation – the proper distinction between the two terms is not clearly defined in the literature. Perhaps the

most useful distinction is that made by Henry Wallich (1984, p. 85):

'Cooperation' falls well short of 'coordination', a concept which implies a significant modification of

national policies in recognition of international economic interdependence … But 'cooperation' is more

than 'consultation', which may mean little more than that other interested parties will be kept informed.

International Finance

Notwithstanding this distinction, we shall use the term 'coordination' throughout this chapter, although the

lower levels of coordination such as the exchange of information might be considered more appropriately as

examples of cooperation.

International policy coordination is primarily about some form of cooperative relationship between the

policy-makers/authorities of two or more nations. !us, international policy coordination does not directly

involve the private sector _per se_ . As we shall see, this latter point is important because an arrangement made

between national authorities might be undermined by a suspicious private sector. To provide an operational

framework for the discussion we shall distinguish between a hierarchy of three types of coordination: the

exchange of information; the acceptance of mutually consistent policies; and joint action.

_The exchange of information_

A minimal type of coordination is the exchange of information between the authorities of two or more

countries. !is exchange may be on a limited or quite considerable scale. !e type of information that might

be exchanged includes the authorities' views about the appropriate value of the exchange rate, the present and

future course of their domestic macroeconomic policies and intentions with regard to future exchange market

intervention, economic forecasts and principal objectives of economic policies, and so on. !e exchange of

information will not by itself lead to agreement on what are the appropriate macroeconomic policies, let

alone joint action. As such, it represents a minimal level of coordination. What it is likely to lead to is a better

understanding of how con$ict can be averted and where the greatest uncertainty lies.

_Mutually consistent policies_

!e exchange of information may provide the basis for more active coordination in that the countries concerned

accept either formally or informally to adopt consistent macroeconomic policy stances. Each country takes

into account the aims and policies of other countries when formulating its own policy stance. Coordination

at this level means the authorities pursue mutually compatible target values and adjust the selection of policy

instruments, their magnitude and timing to avoid con$ict with other countries. Such coordination requires an

exchange of information with other countries and that account be taken of the policies and objectives being

pursued in those other countries.

_Joint action_

Having exchanged information and agreed on mutually consistent target values for the objectives of

economic policy, the authorities of the two economies could go one step further and agree on joint action to

achieve desired targets. For example, if a certain value of the real exchange rate is required to achieve these

- bjectives, joint action would mean that the two authorities act together to manipulate the exchange rate in
the desired direction. Joint action means not only an agreement on the appropriate exchange rate value, but
also concerted action to achieve that rate. As we shall see, much of the recent literature on macroeconomic
policy) coordination) has focused mainly on two types of joint action. One is when fiscal and monetary
policies)are adjusted to maximize joint welfare, the other is when the exchange rate is jointly targeted. Some
proposals for policy coordination combine fiscal and monetary policies with some form of exchange rate
targeting.

344

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

14.3 WHY DOES THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL POLICY COORDINATION ARISE?

Coordination of macroeconomic and exchange rate policies would not be necessary if exchange rate changes

truly insulated one country from another, as advocates of $oating exchange rates had presupposed. In such

circumstances, one economy would not be affected by the policy mix pursued in other economies. Experience

with $oating exchange rates has amply demonstrated that such independence does not exist. In particular,

the phenomenon of exchange rate 'overshooting' (see Chapter 7) means that the monetary policy pursued

in one country will have spillover effects on its trading partners. An initial money expansion will lead to a

depreciation of the expanding country's real exchange rate, conferring on it a competitive advantage. However,

the real exchange rate of its trading partners will have appreciated, reducing their exports and thereby their

income and employment levels.

Economic policy coordination is only necessary if economic policies themselves have effects upon the real

economy. If monetary and fiscal policies have no effect on employment and output levels, as some theorists

argue, then there would be no benefits to be derived from international coordination of such policies. As

Alfred Steinherr (1984, p. 77) puts it:

In a world where markets for all possible trades exist ('completeness of markets'), where all markets,

including the labour market, are competitive and all prices fully $exible, where all agents are rational

and adjustment costs of pricing and input decisions negligible there is no need for adjustment policies,

and therefore no need for co-ordination. Each economy would then adjust instantaneously to any

surprises ('shocks') and operate at its natural employment level and there would be no overshooting

  - f the exchange rate. !us the need for policy coordination may from this angle be regarded as due to
market imperfections. According to this view reduction of imperfections would reduce the need for
policy intervention and coordination, and act as a substitute for coordination. Needless to say, not all
imperfections can be eliminated in the real world. As a consequence policies can potentially improve
the market outcome and, in interdependent economies, produce spillover effects.

Frenkel (1983) points out that spillover effects that give rise to the need for coordination are the result of two

important linkages between the domestic economy and the rest of the world. In the first instance, countries

are connected via trade $ows: the exports of one country are the imports of another and vice versa. Changes

in these volumes will affect the national incomes of the countries concerned and with it employment levels.

!e second vital linkage is that provided by international capital movements: these permit the transmission

- f economic disturbances from one economy to another by freeing an economy from the need to keep its
current account in balance. In this way, policies that in$uence the current account position of a country will
have spillover effects on its trading partners' current account positions. Capital movements also have the effect

- f tying international interest rate differentials and expected exchange rate changes via the UIP condition.
As such, policies that in$uence the domestic interest rate will have effects on trading partners via induced
changes in the real exchange rate.

In effect, the need for coordination is derived from spillover effects associated with interdependence.

Cooper (1985) defines structural interdependence as a situation whereby the structures of two or more

economies are such that economic events in one significantly in$uence economic events in the other(s).

Hence, if economic policies adopted in one country affect its real economy then they will also have spillover

effects on other countries. In such circumstances, the optimal course of action for one country will depend

upon the course of action taken by other countries. Interdependence means that a country cannot achieve its

345

International Finance

- bjectives without these being mutually consistent with those pursued by other countries. Furthermore, the
resulting policy interdependence means that a country has to take into account the policies of other countries.
!is implies the need for a certain degree of international policy coordination if countries wish to achieve
their objectives. !e need is especially acute where the trade and capital linkages are high, such as those which
exist between the European Union member states.

As an illustration of the interdependence between economies, Table 14.1 presents the results of the

effects)of)monetary and fiscal expansion by the USA and non-US OECD countries according to a variety of

well-known models of the international economy (this approach is further discussed later in the chapter in

**section 14.8** ).

14.4 THE BENEFITS FROM INTERNATIONAL POLICY COORDINATION

When one talks about the benefits to be derived from international policy coordination these will be dependent

upon the type and degree of coordination undertaken. In general terms, coordination is a means of preserving

and improving the benefits associated with increased interdependence, such as the gains from trade and

access to international capital markets.

!e potential gains from coordination of macroeconomic policies internationally have been conceptually

illustrated by Hamada (1974, 1976, 1985) using what has become known as the Hamada diagram. !e

principles underlying the derivation of the Hamada diagram for the hypothetical case of Europe and America

are shown in Figure 14.1.

In the Hamada diagram, the macropolicy configuration of Europe is shown on the horizontal axis,

while that of America is shown on the vertical axis. For instance, as we move along the horizontal axis the

Policy configuration of Europe

346

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

macropolicy stance of Europe may be more expansionary, and likewise as we move up the vertical axis for

America. Because the two countries are interdependent the optimal policy stance for Europe is dependent

upon the policy stance taken by America, and vice versa.

Conceptually, there must be a point on the diagram for Europe that gives a combination of its own policy

stance and that of America which it prefers to all other possible policy combinations. !is point of bliss for

Europe is given by point _E_ *. Likewise, for America there must be a combination of its own policy and that of

Europe that it prefers to all other policy combinations; this is given by point _A_ *.

_U_ and _U_

For both Europe and America we can draw sets of elliptically shaped indifference curves E A

that denote combinations of European and American policies that yield the same level of utility. From the

_U_ to

viewpoint of Europe, the closer the policy configuration of the two economies puts it on a utility curve E

point _E_ - the better off it is. Hence, a combined policy configuration that puts it on utility curve _U_ E1 is preferred

to _U_

E2. Similarly, from the viewpoint of America, the closer the policy configuration of the two countries puts

it on a utility curve to point _A_ *, the better off it is. A combined policy configuration that puts it on utility

curve _U_ A1 is preferred to _U_ A2. In the special case, where the two countries are totally independent, the utility

curves for Europe are vertical straight lines and those for America are horizontal straight lines. Each country

could then achieve its optimal level of welfare merely by adjusting its own policy instruments, regardless of

the policy pursued by the other country.

!e problem for each economy is to determine its optimal policy stance for any given policy stance of the

- ther; this yields a policy reaction schedule for each economy. !e policy reaction schedule for Europe is
found by taking a given policy stance of America and finding a utility curve _U_ E which is tangential to it: this is
the utility closest to point _E_ *, which means Europe adopts policy stance _E_ 1 when the USA is pursuing policy

_A_

1. One can find various other optimal policy stances of Europe given a different policy stance by America,
and by joining the points together one obtains the policy reaction function of Europe as _R_ E. Similarly, the
policy reaction schedule for America is found by taking a given policy stance of Europe such as _E_ 1 and finding
a utility curve _U_ A2 which is tangential to a vertical line from _E_ 1. !is is the utility curve closest to point _A_ which means America's best policy stance is _A_ 2. In a like manner, one can find various other optimal policy
stances of America given a different policy stance by Europe, and by joining the points together one obtains
the policy reaction function of America as _R_ A.

!e locus of points passing between _E_ [*] and _A_ [*], where the utility curves _U_ E and _U_ A are tangential to one

another, is known as the pareto contract curve. Since the indifference curves are tangential to one another

along the contract curve this indicates that one country can be made better off only by making the other

country worse off. In the region of the contract curve between _E_ [*] and _A_ [*] the closer we are to point _E_ - (the

further from point _A_ *) the better off is Europe and the worse off is America. Conversely, the closer we are to

point _A_ - (the further from point _E_ *) the better off is America and the worse off is Europe. Note that the utility

curves are drawn as oval-shaped ellipses, with the level of utility falling the further an oval-shaped curve is

from the country's preferred point.

We can now use the Hamada diagram to illustrate the potential gains from the coordination of macropolicies

between the two economies. !is is illustrated in Figure 14.2.

To establish potential gains from international macropolicy coordination it is necessary to compare the

possible situation under coordination vis-à-vis a scenario of non-coordination. !e problem is that there is

a range of possible coordination scenarios, and likewise one could also envisage a range of non-coordination

scenarios. Figure 14.2 compares possible coordination scenarios with two popular non-coordination scenarios

known as Nash and Stackleberg equilibriums.

In the Nash non-cooperative scenario each economy takes the policy stance of its partner economy as

beyond its in$uence and adopts its optimal isolationist policy in this belief. If Europe pursues policy _E_ 1, the

- ptimal policy for America is _A_ 1, but given this the optimal policy for Europe is then _E_ 2, and given this the
- ptimal policy for America is _A_ 2, and so on. !e economies continue to interact in this manner despite the
fact that each economy's policy strategy choice does in$uence the choice of the other. A Nash equilibrium is
finally reached when there is no incentive for either economy to change its policy stance, taking the other's
policy as given. In the Hamada diagram the Nash equilibrium is given by point N where the two reaction
schedules intersect. At point N there is no incentive for either economy to change its policies. America is on
utility curve _U_ AN while Europe is on utility curve _U_ EN.

With the Stackleberg scenario, one of the two countries (the leader) is assumed to be more intelligent

than in the Nash scenario and realizes that its policy stance in$uences the choice of the other country, while

the other (the follower) ignores the in$uence of its policy stance on the leader. Consequently, the leader

anticipates possible rational reactions of the follower when making its policy choice. In Figure 14.2 we assume

that America is the leader, and this leads to a Stackleberg equilibrium at point S. At point S there is a utility

curve _U_ AS that is just tangential to Europe's reaction schedule _R_ E. !is is the closest indifference curve to point

_A_ - that America can reach knowing the whole range of possible reactions of Europe. With America pursuing

Stackleberg policy AS the best policy for Europe is _E_ 1.

When comparing the Nash and Stackleberg non-cooperative equilibriums the Stackleberg solution is

certainly superior for the leader compared to the Nash solution, and may or may not prove superior to the

Nash solution for the follower. However, both the non-cooperative scenarios are pareto-ine'cient since they

do not lie on the contract curve _E_ - _A_ *. In theory, both economies could agree to adopt policy combinations

that make them both better off compared to either the Nash or Stackleberg non-cooperative scenarios. For

example, between the portion ab on the contract curve _A_ - _E_ - both countries would be on higher utility curves

compared to the Stackleberg scenario. Hence, with coordination of economic policies the level of welfare for

348

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

both economies can be raised as compared to non-coordination. If the economies agree to coordinate to get

- nto the contract curve, the precise position they get to depends upon their relative bargaining strengths. !e
stronger the relative bargaining power of Europe the closer the position on the contract curve it will be to
point _E_ *, while the stronger the bargaining position of America the closer the solution on the contract curve
will be to _A_ *.

In passing, we note that if both countries were to try to become a Stackleberg leader a situation known as

'Stackleberg warfare' would break out; this has no equilibrium solution because the assumptions each country

makes are mutually inconsistent. Another important point made by Currie (1990) is that international

macroeconomic policy does not require that the two countries' governments have the same objectives or even

the same set of preferences. Indeed, this point is illustrated in the Hamada diagram where the two countries'

governments have different points of bliss.

14.5 A GAME THEORY DEMONSTRATION OF THE GAINS FROM COORDINATION

!e Stackleberg and Nash solutions illustrated by the Hamada diagram are demonstrations of the results of

traditional game theory. Simple game theory is usually presented as a pay-off matrix, an example of which is

set out in Figure 14.3.

!e figure depicts what is known in game theory as a pay-off matrix. We assume that the pay-off to each

economy is measured by a 'misery index', which is simply the sum of an economy's in$ation and unemployment

rates. For simplicity of exposition we shall assume that policy-makers regard an additional 1% of in$ation to

be equally as bad as an additional 1% of unemployment. !is being the case, the aim of economic policy will

be to minimize an economy's misery index. !e first of each of the two numbers separated by a comma is the

misery index (pay-off) of Europe, while the second is the pay-off of America. For example, if Europe pursues

policy 1 and America pursues policy 4, the result will be a misery index of 7 for Europe and 15 for America.

Similarly, if Europe pursues policy 2 while America pursues policy 3, the pay-off will be a misery index of 15

for Europe and 6 for America.

Using the pay-off matrix it is straightforward to illustrate the potential gains from the coordination of

policies. Suppose that each economy seeks to minimize its misery index but chooses its policy package in

isolation without any coordination. When deciding whether or not to pursue policy 1 or policy 2, Europe

does not know what policy will be chosen by America. Hence, the authorities of Europe will consider the

consequences if America pursues either policy 3 or policy 4. If America were to pursue policy 3, the best

policy for Europe is policy 1, which gives it a misery index of 12 compared to 15 if it pursued policy 2. If

America were to pursue policy 4, the best policy for Europe is, again, policy 1, which gives it a misery index

- f 7 compared to a misery index of 8 were it to employ policy 2. Hence, no matter what policy is chosen by
America, the best isolationist policy for Europe is to pursue policy 1. An analogous set of reasoning applies
to the policy choice of America. If Europe pursues policy 1, the best policy for America is policy 3, giving a
misery index of 12 compared to 15 if it pursues policy 4. Likewise, if Europe pursues policy 2 the best policy
for America is, again, policy 3, which gives a misery index of 6 as opposed to 8 if it pursues policy 4. Hence,
no matter what policy is chosen by Europe, the best isolationist policy for America to pursue is policy 3.

!e result of each making its policy decisions in isolation is that Europe pursues policy 1 while America

pursues policy 3. !e resulting misery index for both economies is 12. !is non-cooperation scenario is worse

for both economies than if they were to engage in cooperation. By cooperation Europe could agree to pursue

policy 2 and America agree to pursue policy 4. !is policy configuration gives both countries a misery index

- f only 8, which is superior to the 12 of acting in isolation.

One of the problems for such cooperative agreements is that once there is an agreement there may

be incentives for one or more parties to renege on the agreement. Suppose Europe and America agree to

cooperate)and pursue policies 2 and 4 respectively. If Europe is sure that America will adopt the agreed

policy)4)then the best policy for Europe to pursue is not policy 2 to which it agreed, but rather policy 1.

Similarly, if America is sure that Europe will pursue policy 2 then the best policy for it to pursue is policy)3

rather than policy 4. Hence, it is possible that cooperative agreements will be undermined at times by the

reneging of one or more parties to the agreement. As such, there may need to be stiff penalties against parties

that renege and a monitoring system designed to spot any reneging country.

14.6 OTHER POTENTIAL BENEFITS FROM COORDINATION

!e Hamada diagram and pay-off matrix illustrations provide simple demonstrations of the potential gains

to be had from international policy coordination. However, the analysis is simple in that each country is

assumed to know the range of potential policies that the other country could pursue and can also calculate the

consequences of various policy combinations on its own welfare. In the real world we can expect some gains

from coordination that are not well-illustrated by traditional game theory. !ese include:

 - **Reduction of uncertainty.** One of the major benefits to be expected from cooperation is that it
should help to reduce the uncertainty element associated with the implementation of policy. When
economies are interdependent, the course of action that a country should take will be di'cult to
decide in isolation because the optimal policy will depend upon the policy actions of others. In
the real world a country rarely knows the course of action that will be taken by other economies
and their probable reactions to changes in its own policy stance. Coordination has the potential to
reduce the possibility of serious con$ict. An exchange of information improves the information set
available to the authorities, enabling them to pursue superior policies than could be pursued without
such information. In the absence of an information exchange, there may be serious shortcomings in
policy design, particularly with regard to miscalculation about the reactions of foreign authorities.
Such errors could prove very costly in today’s interdependent economies. Furthermore, the reduced
possibility of con$ict will improve the environment in which international trade is conducted.

 - **Coordination may avoid excessive deflation.** Oudiz and Sachs (1985) point out that coordination
may prove crucial to improving welfare when the foreign exchange market is forward-looking. One
way that authorities may be tempted to control in$ation in isolation is to announce today that money
supply growth will be lower in the future. If such an announcement is believed, the authorities of that

350

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

country will benefit from an immediate real appreciation of their currency, reducing present in$ation.

!e other country, however, will experience a real depreciation of its currency giving a boost to its

in$ation rate. In the absence of coordination both countries may be tempted to engage in competitive

announcements of intentions to control future monetary growth. Only a coordination agreement

between the two countries to avoid such a competitive manipulation of the exchange rate can remove

the danger of excessive de$ation.

14.7 THE POTENTIAL FOR COORDINATION TO MAKE COUNTRIES WORSE OFF

!ere is an intuitive inclination to believe that international policy cooperation must improve the welfare of

each of the countries involved and thereby global welfare as compared to non-coordination scenarios. !is

intuition runs as follows. Since at worst countries could cooperatively agree to pursue similar policies as in a

non–coordination scenario, then the policies they choose under coordination must be superior or they would

have pursued the non-cooperative policies. However, the literature has shown that this is not necessarily

the case. !ere are three instances in which coordination between two or more countries may make the

participating countries worse off rather than better off. One involves an unfavourable reaction by private

agents to coordination between authorities; another involves an unfavourable reaction by a third country to

coordination between a subset of countries; a final instance involves coordination making countries worse off

because the policies pursued are based on the wrong economic model.

_The reaction of private agents_

Kenneth Rogoff (1985) pointed out that coordination between national authorities is only potentially superior

to non-coordination because it is necessary to take into account the reaction of the private sector. !e basic

argument put forward by Rogoff is that the behaviour of private agents cannot be considered by the authorities

as indifferent to any arrangements that they come to with trading partners. Rogoff argues that an adverse

reaction by private agents to a cooperative arrangement between national authorities can make things worse

rather than better.

Specifically, Rogoff considers the case where national authorities seek to raise the level of employment in

their economies in a model in which there is exchange rate overshooting. Acting in isolation, each country

resists the temptation to in$ate because they realize that this will lead to a real depreciation of their currencies

which will raise import costs and lead to a quick upward adjustment to domestic wages and prices. If, however,

the central banks come to an agreement to in$ate together to raise employment levels, they can overcome the

fear of a depreciation of their real exchange rate. !is means that with coordination the incentives to in$ate

are greater. Rogoff argues that rational private agents will take this additional in$ation risk into account when

setting their wage contracts and raise their wage demands accordingly. In such circumstances, the authorities

may face a higher average in$ation rate in a coordination regime than acting in isolation.

!e possibility that coordination between authorities may lead to a deterioration in global welfare stems

from a credibility problem vis-à-vis the private sector. Rogoff suggests that one way to remove this adverse

risk of policy coordination is for the coordinating governments to make institutional changes to improve

their credibility, such as making their central banks independent with a statute committing them to price

stability (low in$ation). !is would then remove private agents' mistrust of the authorities, enabling them to

coordinate to improve their economic welfare.

_The reaction of a third country_

It is conceivable that cooperation between two or more countries that would ordinarily raise their joint welfare

could provoke an adverse reaction by a third country. If such a reaction has a significant negative impact on

the coordinating countries then it is possible that the cooperating countries end up worse-off. For example,

Europe and America might decide to de$ate their economies in their joint interest, but because of the adverse

effects for Japanese exports this may lead Japan to de$ate its economy which then exacerbates the recession

in America and Europe above what they anticipated, making them worse-off than if they had not agreed to

joint de$ation.

_Cooperation based on the wrong model_

Frankel and Rockett (1988) argue that cooperation may prove inferior to non-cooperation due to the presence

- f uncertainty over the true economic model. In a world of uncertainty, the structural parameters and linkages
between economies as well as the relationship between instruments and targets are not known for sure.
Given this, it is possible that, if countries agree to coordinate their monetary and fiscal policies based on
particular models of their economies, and the model(s) used turn out to be the wrong model(s), the agreed
cooperative policies may be seriously defective and make one or both countries worse-off as compared to
non-coordination. !e results of the Frankel and Rockett study are considered more fully in the following

section.

14.8 ESTIMATES OF THE BENEFITS AND LOSSES FROM INTERNATIONAL POLICY

COORDINATION

While it is practically impossible to measure the benefits or losses from international policy coordination in

the real world, because of the perennial problem of estimating what would have happened in the absence of

coordination, this has not prevented a number of researchers using economic models to make simulation

estimates of the potential gains/losses associated with international macroeconomic policy coordination. One

- f the most interesting studies is that carried out by Frankel and Rockett (1988).

To estimate the potential benefits from international policy coordination Frankel and Rockett used ten

different economic models, as listed in Table 14.1. !ese models are representative of a variety of economic

methodologies ranging from detailed large-scale structural models to more reduced-form models of

economies. !e models re$etc a spectrum of Keynesian, monetarist and neoclassical schools of economic

thought.

!e basic methodology used by Frankel and Rockett is as follows. Each government is assumed to believe

that one of the ten models is the correct economic model and may or may not be correct in that assumption.

For example, two possible scenarios are that the US may believe in the MCM model, while Europe believes

in the OECD model; or the US may believe in the OECD model while Europe believes in the EEC model.

In some cases, the two countries may believe in the same model. Each country agrees to coordinate with the

- ther country to maximize their perceived joint welfare as compared to the perceived Nash non-cooperative
- utcome. In total there are 100 coordination scenarios to examine, because for each of the ten models that the
USA might believe in, there are ten alternative models that the Europeans could use.

For each of the 100 scenarios Frankel and Rockett examine the welfare effects for both the USA and Europe

- f the coordination scenario as compared to the Nash non-cooperation scenario. To measure the potential

welfare gain or loss to each country from coordination under the various scenarios it is necessary to know

what the true model is. For each of the 100 scenarios, Frankel and Rockett examine the welfare gains/losses

to the USA and Europe by assuming in turn that each of the ten models is true. For example, in the scenario

where the USA believes in the MCM model and Europe believes in the OECD model, the potential gains/

losses in welfare to each of the two parties are examined by assuming that in turn the MCM model is true,

then the EEC model is true, then the EPA model is true, and so on. !is means that there are 100 times 10,

that is, 1,000 possible welfare gain/loss scenarios for each country to examine.

Frankel and Rockett discover that out of the 1,000 possible combinations of coordination between the

two economies, US welfare was improved in 546 cases, while it ended up worse-off in 321 cases, with its

welfare unchanged in 133 cases. Europe's welfare was improved in 539 cases, while it ended up worse-off in

327 cases, with its welfare unchanged in 134 cases. Hence, although on balance a country is likely to gain

from coordination, there remains a very significant chance (approximately 32%) that it will end up worse-off,

because coordination has been based upon the wrong economic model. Even these results are slightly biased

in favour of coordination because, in instances where at least one of the countries is using the correct model,

coordination is bound to be beneficial to that country or it would not have agreed to coordinate. By excluding

such cases there are 810 combinations where neither country is correct. In these cases, the USA has gains in

419 cases, losses in 286 cases and no effect in 105. For Europe there are gains in 408 cases, losses in 298 and

no effect in 104.

Frankel and Rockett recognize that the above methodology may underestimate the case for coordination

because policy-makers do not explicitly take into account the possibility that the model they utilize may be

invalid. If they did take into account the presence of model uncertainty, then the probability of success from

coordination would be significantly raised; a result that is confirmed by Ghosh and Masson (1988). Holtham

and Hughes-Hallett (1987) show that by eliminating instances where one of the countries expects the other

countries to be worse-off according to its model considerably enhances the probability of coordination

raising the welfare of the countries concerned. !ey argue that in practice governments will wish to avoid

circumstances where they benefit and the other country is made worse-off (so-called 'weak bargains') from

coordination because this would encourage the other country to renege and jeopardize future coordination

between the countries.

With regard to the magnitude of gains from international policy coordination, a number of authors such as

Oudiz and Sachs (1984, 1985) and Frankel and Rockett (1988) have shown that the potential welfare gains from

macroeconomic coordination are not very high, even under conditions very favourable to it. !ese conditions

are that both countries use the same model, which is in fact the true one, and that in such circumstances

cooperation must leave both parties better off or they would not cooperate. Oudiz and Sachs (1985) calculate

that, even in the case where the USA, Japan and West Germany coordinated their fiscal and monetary policies

perfectly for the mid-1970s, the gains from coordination were less than 0.5% of GNP for each country. Miller

and Salmon (1985) argue that in the long run there are no gains from international coordination, since in each

country the equilibrium level of output is determined by a vertical Phillips curve and $oating exchange rates

permit the desired level of in$ation to be achieved without the need for international policy coordination.

!ey conclude that 'what gains there may be from coordination must come therefore, in choosing the path

towards equilibrium and not in the final equilibrium'.

Although the gains from international coordination seem to be relatively small, using a somewhat

different methodology can substantially raise the gains from coordination. McKibben and Sachs (1991)

find that monetary policy coordination brings about relatively insignificant gains but a combination of both

monetary and fiscal coordination leads to more significant gains. O(en coordination is brought about because

economies are a%icted by common shocks. Currie et al. (1987) find that while the gains from cooperation are

354

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

small in the case of transitory shocks, the estimated gains rise steeply as the persistence of a shock increases.

In a similar vein, Holtham and Hughes-Hallett (1987) find that the gains from international coordination in

the face of permanent shocks can amount to 4–6% of GDP.

More recently there has been an interest in using the new open-economy macroeconomic (NOEM)

models, which are based upon microeconomic foundations and monopolistic competition with explicit

consumer utility functions to analyse the potential gains to be had from monetary cooperation (see Box 7.2

in Chapter 7). Results obtained from these models are very sensitive to the parameter values assumed and

particular model specification employed. In an early analysis of the issues, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002) found

the gains from monetary policy coordination to be negligible. However, in a recent paper Tchakarov (2004)

finds that the gains from international monetary policy coordination can be as high as 2.2% of steady-state

consumption when different plausible parameter values to those employed by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002) are

used. It seems that the NOEM models are unable to resolve the controversy about the potential benefits from

international policy coordination!

Before concluding this section, it is worth remembering that even if the true model were employed by

coordinating countries, the rules required to achieve fully optimal policy coordination are likely to prove to

be extremely complex, too complex to be implemented in practice. Given this, estimates of the gains from

fully optimal coordination, even though not particularly pronounced, probably need to be treated as generous

estimates of the real-world benefits from coordination. !is critique is particularly applicable to the NOEM

models which require an implausible amount of computational ability on the part of economic agents and

policy-makers.

14.9 PROBLEMS AND OBSTACLES TO INTERNATIONAL POLICY COORDINATION

!e previous section showed that international policy coordination may have a role in raising global welfare,

even though the precise gains will be di'cult to quantify. Indeed, there are plenty of real-world examples

- f countries involving themselves in some form of international coordination – membership of the Bretton
Woods system, the European Monetary Union, the IMF and the OECD are all examples of differing types of
international macroeconomic cooperation and coordination. However, casual observation suggests that the
degree of observed international policy coordination falls far short of the degree of interdependence between
economies. For this reason, we need to consider some of the major obstacles that inhibit greater international
macroeconomic policy coordination.

_Negotiation and reduced flexibility costs_

Once a country decides to try and improve its welfare by engaging in international policy coordination,

an obstacle to it actually achieving a successful coordination package is the negotiation process. Reaching

agreement on a successful international macroeconomic policy stance can prove extremely di'cult and

complex and this complexity will increase exponentially with the number of targets, instruments and countries

involved in the process. In addition, it is di'cult for many governments to pre-commit themselves in areas

such as fiscal policy. !is being the case, international macroeconomic policy coordination is more likely to

yield results when the number of countries is small and objectives are limited. Once a coordination package

is agreed upon, it is likely that policy-makers will find that they have less $exibility and there will be delays

when implementing their policies as they have to obtain agreement from other countries when altering their

policies.

355

International Finance

_Disagreement over appropriate macroeconomic policies_

One of the major obstacles to greater coordination is not so much an ignorance on the part of policymakers to the potential benefits to be derived, but rather disagreement over how to realize them. !e

debate in macroeconomics over the role, impact and effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies and major

international policy issues, such as the desirability of fixed and $oating exchange rates, is far from settled,

as reading this book reveals. !is disagreement is not restricted to the quantitative effects of given policy

mixtures but o(en concerns the qualitative aspects. Uncertainty also exists over the appropriate instrument to

employ to achieve a given policy objective. !is uncertainty over means–ends relationships leaves enormous

scope for disagreement between countries that share similar objectives. As Ralph Bryant (1985, p. 216) puts it:

In real-life discussions among national governments, the most fundamental obstacle to more

cooperation is not lack of awareness of the potential gains from coordination. Nor is it merely lack of

political will. To be sure, both those lacunae are important … Yet a still more important obstacle is the

tremendous uncertainty about the magnitudes, and even the signs, of cross-border transmissions of

economic forces.

!e point is that theoreticians who analyse the benefits to be derived from coordination using a game theoretic

approach in which the pay-off matrix is known simplify the obstacles to agreement between policy-makers

who do not know the pay-off matrix or the best policies to pursue to reap the gains from coordination.

Indeed, this lack of agreement over the best policy exists just as much within as between countries. Such

disagreement extends to differences of view over the current state of the economy and what the appropriate

priorities for the economy are.

_Not all countries gain from coordination_

If the pay-off matrix is known and means–ends relationships are fairly clear, it may be possible for policy-makers

to improve their joint welfare by cooperation. However, designing a cooperative policy that maximizes joint

welfare does not necessarily mean that each individual country which is party to the agreement necessarily

gains; it may be the case that some countries are made worse-off when designing a cooperative agreement. In

such circumstances, to make it worthwhile for loser countries to engage in policy cooperation, it is necessary

for some form of compensation to be paid. !is is especially the case if the loser countries are the ones that

have to make the biggest policy adjustments (from which other countries gain). In the real world, examples of

compensation for countries that undertake macroeconomic policies that are beneficial to the rest of the world

but harmful to themselves are di'cult to cite. In practice, this means that cooperative agreements may be

restricted to instances where all countries are made better-off which would accordingly reduce the potential

gains from coordination.

_Reneging and the problem of time consistency_

Another potential problem with policy coordination is derived by using dynamic game theory, and this

highlights the problem of time consistency (see Kyland and Prescott, 1977). A policy is said to be time

inconsistent if there is an incentive to depart from the policy at any time now or in the future. A timeinconsistent coordination arrangement would imply that there are incentives for one or more of the countries

that are party to a coordination package to renege, either in the present or sometime in the future. Using

356

International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

advanced game theory, Currie and Levine (1985) have shown that the problem of time consistency can pose

a major threat to coordination. !e reason is that a country which reneges on a time-inconsistent cooperative

agreement may retain an advantage in the long run. Moreover, the threat of retaliation by a partner country

may not be credible because such retaliation would make the retaliating country worse off. An associated

problem is that making a cooperative agreement time consistent may lead to markedly inferior outcomes

compared to a time-inconsistent, fully optimal, cooperative policy. While this may provide a strong incentive

for far-sighted governments not to succumb to the temptation of reneging, Currie and Levine suggest the

need for innovative punishment clauses as part of cooperative agreements to overcome the threat of countries

reneging.

In practice, governments may be very reluctant to renege on coordination agreements and would only

rationally do so if the perceived benefits of reneging exceed the perceived costs. By breaking a cooperative

agreement the authorities may face penalties from other countries and be excluded from future participation

in cooperative agreements. Currie et al. (1987) argue that in practice these costs will comfortably exceed the

benefits, making reneging a fairly rare phenomenon. In a similar vein, Hughes-Hallett (1986) argues that the

risks and associated costs of retaliation against cheating parties are relatively high, while the gains from a

successful cheat are relatively low, making cheating a risky strategy with a negative expected outcome.

14.10 CONCLUSIONS

International policy coordination is very complex, posing new issues for policy-makers that do not arise if

they pursue policies in isolation. !ese issues are so complex that we should not expect coordination to yield

globally optimal solutions. In practice, coordination is likely to remain restricted to certain domains such

as the exchange of information, exchange rate policy and monetary policy, where means–ends relationships

are reasonably clear (avoidance of con$icting policies, preservation of trade $ows and in$ation control) and

the potential gains from coordination are greatest. However, the recent eurozone crisis has shown that fiscal

policy coordination is a necessary ingredient for the successful operation of the zone. Hence the 1996 Stability

and Growth Pact which permitted 3% fiscal deficit to GDP ratios has had to be replaced by the 2012 Fiscal

Compact which seeks balanced budgets.

It is noticeable that cooperation has proved easier in the trade arena with such arrangements as the General

Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (now the World Trade Organization) and the European Union. !ere is a

large consensus in the trade literature that increased trade is beneficial for all countries, which contrasts with

the lack of agreement in the international macroeconomic sphere with arguments over the merits of fixed,

$oating and managed exchange rates and controversy over the role and effectiveness of fiscal and monetary

policy in in$uencing economic activity.

While uncertainty can prove to be a major obstacle to greater international coordination, this should not

be overstated. Uncertainty can at times prove to be an incentive to international coordination: the exchange of

information motivated by the desire to avoid policy con$ict is one of the most common types of coordination

that actually takes place in the real world. In addition, countries have been su'ciently uncertain about the

relative merits of overand undervalued exchange rates that they have not become involved in competitive

exchange rate manipulations. An overvalued exchange rate in relation to PPP has been viewed as advantageous

in the fight against in$ation, while an undervalued rate is viewed as useful in giving a boost to exports and

employment. !is uncertainty may account for the lack of 'exchange rate wars' experienced under $oating

rates despite the major real exchange rate changes that have occurred.

357

International Finance

!e move from fixed to $oating exchange rates has coincided with a decline in the relative economic

in$uence of the United States. !e Bretton Woods system has been analysed as a situation where the US was

the leader and Europe and Japan were followers, as in a Stackleberg scenario. Since the adoption of $oating

exchange rates the relative economic dominance of the US has declined while the economic importance of

Europe and Japan has risen, such that the Stackleberg scenario is no longer an adequate characterization. In

such a tripolar world the dangers of a Nash-type scenario are ever-present, especially given the extra degree

- f freedom associated with $oating exchange rates.

A useful distinction can be made between global and subglobal coordination. Global coordination involves

countries from different regions of the world that have a significant impact on the global economy. !e three

countries that qualify in this category are the United States, Japan and Germany. Subglobal coordination refers

to coordination between countries which are not necessarily important at the global level but have a high

degree of structural interdependence with one another. !e Bretton Woods system represented an example of

global coordination, whereas the European Monetary System and its replacement by the European Monetary

Union represents an example of subglobal coordination. !e move from a US-dominated world to a tripolar

- ne has to date increased the importance of subglobal coordination relative to global coordination, though
there is no obvious reason for this.

!e theoretical and simulation literature has served as a warning that policy-makers should not expect

substantial gains from the coordination of economic policies internationally. Although this message may

sound pessimistic, in many ways it is a re$ection of the increasing scepticism concerning the ability of

governments to in$uence the real economy in a desirable and predictable fashion via manipulation of fiscal

and monetary policies, even in a closed economy framework.

15.1 INTRODUCTION

On 12 August 1982, the Mexican government announced that it could not meet its forthcoming debt repayments

- n its \$80 billion of outstanding debt to international banks. !is was the first sign of the Latin American debt
crisis. Soon a(er the Mexican announcement, a number of other developing countries announced that they
too were facing severe di'culty in meeting forthcoming repayments. !roughout the 1980s and 1990s and
the early part of the new century the problems faced by developing countries in servicing their debts has been

- ne of the major international policy issues. Granting debt relief has recently also become a major policy issue.

!e debt crisis encompassed a wide set of countries from low-income developing nations to middleincome countries. In this chapter, we concentrate primarily upon four countries that were classified by the

World Bank in its 1994 _World Debt Tables_ as severely indebted middle-income countries (SIMICs), that is,

Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. In its 2004 _Global Development Finance_ _Report_ the World Bank

classification of a SIMIC is that the country must be a middle-income country (an annual income of between

\$725 and \$9,075 per capita) and have one of two key ratios above certain critical levels. !ese ratios are

the present value of debt to gross national income (GNI) (80%) and the present value of debt to exports

- f goods)and services (220%). Other than the SIMICs there are groups classified as: moderately indebted

International Finance

middle-income countries (MIMICs); severely indebted low-income countries (SILICs); moderately indebted

low-income countries (MILICs); and less-indebted middle-income countries (LIMICS). As we shall see, in

2002 only Argentina and Brazil of the four countries we examine remained classified as SIMICs, with Mexico

and Venezuela having shown a marked improvement, resulting in them being listed as LIMICs.

Although they were both severely indebted, there are considerable contrasts between the SIMICs and the

SILICs. !e 15 SIMICs identified by the World Bank in 1994 were especially concentrated in Latin America,

and in 1994 their combined external debt amounted to \$587.4 billion, the majority of which was owed to

private sources made up primarily of commercial banks. By contrast, the majority of the 35 SILICs identified

by the World Bank in 1994 were to be found in sub-Saharan Africa – in 1994 their combined external

debt amounted to \$223.6 billion with the vast majority owed to governments and o'cial agencies and the

remainder to private sources.

!e Latin American debt crisis raised many questions. How did the crisis come about? Why did international

banks lend so much money to these countries? Why did the indebted countries not go into outright default?

How was the debt crisis managed? How successful has the management of the crisis been? What lessons can

be learned from the crisis? In this chapter we examine possible answers to these questions. We will pay special

attention to the debt problems of the four major debtors located in Latin America – Mexico, Argentina, Brazil

and Venezuela. !e concentration of commercial bank loans in these four economies led to fears that if any of

them defaulted, this would undermine the banks that lent to them, especially the US banks that had massive

exposures, and threaten an international financial crisis. !e resulting knock-on effects would push the world

into a major economic recession.

15.2 THE LOWAND MIDDLE-INCOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Developing countries are traditionally distinguished from developed economies by their lower per capita

GNP. However, developed and developing countries are far from homogeneous groups. Developing countries

can be placed into two categories:

 - **Low-income developing countries:** typically with incomes of less than \$735 per capita at 2002 prices,
which includes most of sub-Saharan Africa.

 - **Middle-income developing countries:** this group comprises a very wide range of countries with
incomes in the region of more than \$725 per capita and less than \$9,055 per capita at 2002 prices.
Some of this group can be classified as low-middle-income countries, which includes most countries
in Latin America, with per capita incomes in 2003 being Argentina (\$3,000), Brazil (\$2,700), Mexico
(\$6,100) and Venezuela (\$3,300), and many richer African countries.

15.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF TYPICAL MIDDLE-INCOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Since the debt crisis has been predominately confined to developing countries, especially those in the lowto

middle-income group, some discussion of the main features of such middle-income developing countries is

necessary. Although it is di'cult to generalize, the following represents a list of the main differences between

developed and middle-income less-developed economies:

 - **Financial markets.** !e financial markets in developing countries tend to have a relatively limited
range of investment opportunities for savers and are normally subject to a high degree of government

360

The Latin American Debt Crisis

control. Unlike developed countries that tend to have well-developed stock markets, developing

countries' stock markets can be fairly rudimentary in nature and companies have traditionally

been heavily reliant on banks for funding. Banks are usually either state-owned or subject to heavy

government control aimed at maintaining low real interest rates designed to stimulate investment.

A major problem that results from these low real interest rate policies is that they tend to further

discourage saving which is already low because of low income levels. Low savings combined with low

real interest rates lead to an excess demand for funds, which requires credit rationing. Under credit

rationing the decisions as to which industries can borrow and how much are largely determined

by the government of the day. In addition, the low interest rates stimulate expenditure on imports

contributing to balance of payments problems.

 - **Exchange rate pegging and exchange controls.** !e exchange rates of developing countries are
frequently pegged to the US dollar, the euro or a mixture of currencies, o(en on a 'crawlingpeg' basis. Since developing countries tend to have relatively high in$ation rates, pegging their
currencies against foreign currencies which have lower in$ation rates would be impractical as
they would quickly lose competitiveness. For this reason, they frequently devalue the central
rate against)the currencies to which they are pegged. One of the problems with such crawling
peg arrangements is that if the currency to which they are pegged appreciates, such as the
strong dollar)appreciation between 1980 and 1985, this can prove to be disastrous for the
developing countries' exports. For this reason, some developing countries prefer to peg to a
basket of currencies such as the SDR, that will tend not to appreciate or depreciate as much as an
individual)currency.

In addition to pegging their exchange rates, many developing countries make extensive use of

capital controls, with the central bank applying various restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign

currencies. !ese restrictions serve several purposes as far as the developing countries' governments are

concerned. By restricting the ability of their residents to invest their savings abroad, the controls enable

the government to borrow funds from its residents at a lower rate of interest than would otherwise be the

case. Controls)are)usually)heavily biased against capital out$ows, restricting sales of the home currency and

reducing)the strain on foreign currency reserves which would otherwise be required to defend a pegged

exchange rate.

!e exchange controls normally require that home residents obtain government permission to purchase

foreign currencies. O(en the authorities combine the controls with multiple exchange rate systems, which

means that the authorities may offer a different rate of exchange depending upon the nature of the particular

transaction. For instance, if the foreign currency is required to pay for imports of capital equipment or

essential items, the authorities will usually offer a more favourable rate of exchange than if it is required to pay

for the import of luxury consumption goods. !is is because capital imports and cheap prices for essentials

are considered more favourable to economic development.

 **Low degree of diversification.** !e output of less-developed economies is usually far less diversified
than that of developed countries. Agricultural output can represent a fairly high proportion of
GDP and usually their exports are made up of relatively few commodities, such as raw materials
and agricultural goods. !is means their economic performance can be subject to a wide degree

    - f $uctuation due to bad harvests or changes in the value of their principal exports. !e prices of

primary products produced and exported by developing countries tend to $uctuate far more than

the manufactured products of developed economies. !is price variability means that the incomes

361

International Finance

and trade performances of developing countries can be subject to large year-to-year $uctuations.

Recessions in industrialized countries are especially harmful to developing countries as they

experience both a fall in the price of their primary products and a decline in their export volumes,

meaning large reductions in their export revenues.

 - **Inflationary environment.** !e developing countries tend to have persistent problems with
controlling their in$ation rates. Government budget deficits are frequently financed by the
government resorting to money-creation, partly because the financial markets are too rudimentary to
raise the required borrowing from domestic sources and partly because governments find taxing their
citizens to be politically unpopular and o(en easily evaded. !e resulting in$ation reduces the real
value of money held by domestic residents, constituting an 'in$ation tax', and reduces the real value of

   - utstanding government debt.

 To protect workers' wages from the effects of the in$ationary environment there can be a high degree

    - f wage indexation so that wages rise in line with prices. Wage indexation makes it very di'cult

for the authorities to bring in$ation under control because while they take measures to slow down

future in$ation, wages are being adjusted upwards based on previous in$ation. Indexation also

means that real wages are di'cult to reduce should an economic shock, such as a deterioration in the

country's terms of trade, require such a fall. Consequently, such shocks normally lead to increased

unemployment. A rapidly growing workforce leads to a continuous upward pressure on government

expenditure to provide employment in state enterprises.

15.4 THE ECONOMICS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRY BORROWING

A key question relating to the debt problem is why were the middle-income developing countries eager to

borrow and the commercial banks so willing to supply the funds in the first place? From the perspective of

the developing countries, their combinations of low incomes and poorly developed capital markets mean

that there are insu'cient domestic savings to provide the finance for domestic investment. !eir relatively

low capital stock means that there are plenty of opportunities for profitable investment, and low capital to

labour ratio means that the marginal productivity of capital is high. By borrowing funds from abroad they

can raise domestic investment above domestic savings which in turn leads to a higher rate of economic

growth than in the absence of such borrowing. !e fact that investment then exceeds domestic savings

implies that the country is running a current account deficit, the counterpart of which is the capital in$ow

- n the capital account. Later on, the developing country will have to repay the principal and interest on the
loans extended to it. !e hope is that the state of the economy will be such that repayments should present
no problems.

As for the developed economies, their relatively high incomes and sophisticated financial markets lead

to relatively high savings ratios, while their relatively high capital to labour ratios means that the marginal

productivity of capital is relatively low, restricting the amount of profitable investment opportunities.

!is means that there is an excess of savings looking for appropriate investment opportunities, which

exist in abundance in developing countries who in turn lack the required funds. Hence, there is the

potential) for) profitable exchange between the developed and developing countries. !e developing

countries can utilize the excess savings of the developed countries for investment while the lending

developed countries have higher prospective returns from investing in the developing countries than

domestic investments.

362

The Latin American Debt Crisis

15.5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF CAPITAL INFLOWS INTO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

!ere are a variety of means available for developing countries to attract capital in$ows from the developed

economies to finance new investment:

 - **Bond finance.** !e developing countries' governments can issue bonds to foreign investors with a
guaranteed rate of interest depending upon the maturity date of the bond and whether or not it is
denominated in the domestic or foreign currency. If the bond is issued in the domestic currency it is
subject to 'in$ation risk’ because there is a danger that higher than expected in$ation in the issuing
country could undermine the real redemption value of the bond. Alternatively, if the bond is issued
in a foreign currency it is subject to 'default risk' which is the danger that the developing country will
not be able to redeem the bond.

 - **Bank loans.** !e developing countries can borrow money from the commercial banks of the
developed countries. Such loans are usually made either at fixed or $oating rates of interest and may
be of a shortor long-term nature. During the 1970s and 1980s this was the major source of finance
for the Latin American countries. !e loans extended were predominately ‘syndicated loans’; that is,
loans made by syndicates of international banks. !ese loans were generally made in US dollars at
$oating rates of interest, such that the repayments could be adjusted upwards or downwards in line
with changes in international interest rates. !e key rate of interest for such loans is the dollar LIBOR,
the rate of interest at which banks in London lend dollars to one another. Loans to developing
countries are normally expressed as a margin over dollar LIBOR.

 - **Foreign direct investment.** Another means by which developing countries can raise foreign
finance is by attracting direct foreign investment into the country. Such investment can take many
forms. It could involve a foreign multinational acquiring equity in a domestically owned business,
a multinational expanding an existing subsidiary, or foreign investors setting up a completely new
enterprise in the developing country. Such direct investment is a popular method for multinationals
to invest in developing countries since it gives them both ownership and control over the businesses
that they set up and acquire. In addition, it is regarded as a qualitatively different type of capital
in$ow representing a long-term investment and a vote of confidence in the developing country.

 - **Official finance.** In addition to private sources of foreign investment, the developing countries
are also able to raise money for developmental purposes directly from foreign governments and
international institutions. Loans from foreign governments are o(en made at below market rates

	- f interest to developing countries as part of their foreign-aid programmes, while loans from the
World Bank come at favourable rates of interest because the World Bank has a top credit rating which
enables it to raise large sums of capital from private markets at a lower rate of interest than is possible
for an individual developing country.

Overall, a clear distinction needs to be made between debt finance and equity finance. Debt finance, of

which bond, bank and o'cial finance are examples, requires the debtor to repay the principal and the rate

- f interest attached to the loan whatever the economic situation in the debtor nation. If the country faces a
worsening of its economic circumstances, it must repay the principal and interest on its outstanding debt
regardless. !is contrasts with equity finance whereby the foreign investors either own shares or have direct
control of developing countries' companies. In these cases, the repayment for their investment is in the form

- f profits and dividends and changes in the value of the companies are directly related to the performance
- f the companies and the developing country concerned. If the developing country faces adverse economic

363

International Finance

conditions this will lead to fewer repayments to foreign investors in the form of reduced profits and dividends,

and conversely economic prosperity in the developing country will lead to larger profits and dividend

payments to foreign investors.

15.6 MEASURES OF INDEBTEDNESS

When deciding whether to extend a new loan or to make provisions against existing loans or even whether

to write off parts of their outstanding loans, private banks will want to know the probability of the existing

debt or new loan being repaid. !is will enable them to balance the risk and return elements of the loan. !e

problem is that there is no unique indicator or measure of the burden imposed on a country by its external

indebtedness. In order to assess the risks, banks will have to arrive at a view of the economic and political

state of a country. In arriving at their decision on risks, banks rely on a range of indicators, many of which are

reported by the World Bank in its _Global Development Finance Report_ . Some of the most popular statistics

employed to assess country risk are:

 - **External debt as a percentage of exports of goods and services.** !is expresses the country's
external debt, both private, public and publicly guaranteed, as a ratio of its export earnings. !e idea
is that the export earnings are the means by which the country earns foreign currency to pay off its
debt. Problems with this ratio are that exports may be subject to a high degree of $uctuation from
year to year and there are alternative measures a country can employ to pay off its external debt other
than increasing its export revenues; for example, cutting down import expenditure or running down
its foreign exchange reserves.

 - **Reserves as a percentage of total external debt.** !is is a measure showing the reserves that the
central bank of the debtor nation could in theory use to pay off its external debt.

 - **External debt as a percentage of gross national income.** !is is a measure that gives an idea of the
total debt burden in relation to the GNI of the country. However, it says nothing about the annual
burden imposed on the country, the amount of repayments falling due, or which section of the
community the burden will fall upon.

 - **Total debt service as a percentage of exports of goods and services.** !is measures the public and
publicly guaranteed principal and interest repayments that the country has to make as a percentage

	- f its exports of goods and services. It gives an indication of the annual burden facing a debtor in
relation to its export earnings. !e major problem is the effect of variations in export earnings and
this measure only gives the burden for the particular year under consideration.

 - **Total debt service as a percentage of gross national income.** !is figure measures the public and
publicly guaranteed principal and interest repayments that the country has to make as a percentage

	- f)its GNI.

Of course, other statistics, such as the evolution of the current account, unemployment rates and the rate

- f growth of GDP, are usually taken into account when assessing the risk of lending to a given country.
Other non-economic variables which rely upon judgement are also used, including the likelihood of internal
con$ict, degree of religious con$ict, wealth disparity measures and so forth. It is apparent that no individual
indicator can provide an adequate measure of the complexity of a country's debt problem, and for this reason
the various debt measures are usually weighted to provide a formal index measure of the probability of default.
Nonetheless, there is plenty of scope for assessments to differ depending upon the list of variables chosen and
then the weight attached to each variable.

364

The Latin American Debt Crisis

Even when used in combination, the various measures do not necessarily provide an accurate picture of

the creditworthiness of different countries. !ey neglect factors such as the differing degrees of vulnerability

to external shocks, differing capacities to increase export earnings and differing future economic prospects of

the economies. In addition, there may be a difference between the ability of a country to service its external

- bligations and its willingness to do so, although the two are usually positively correlated. An understanding
- f country-risk assessment is an essential background to the study of the debt crisis because part of the blame
for the crisis is attributable to the inadequacies of the measures used by the banks when extending loans to the
debtor nations in the first instance.

**Box 15.1 Some debt terminology**

Within the context of the international debt crisis, many terms are frequently employed and for this

reason are worth defining:

   - **Public and publicly guaranteed debt** . Most of the loans made to developing countries are
made either directly to the developing country government or to state-owned enterprises, and
such debt is known as public debt. Foreign loans to developing countries are frequently made
to the private sector, but because such lending is regarded as highly risky, it is usually necessary
for the developing country government to guarantee to fulfil the loan contract in the case of
non-payment by the private borrower; this type of obligation is known as publicly guaranteed
debt. !e presence of exchange controls in many developing countries means that their
governments usually get involved in loan agreements between foreign and domestic residents.

   - **Total external debt** . !is is the sum of private non-guaranteed debt and public and publicly
guaranteed debt.

   - **Debt service** . !is is the sum of principal and interest rate repayments that a country has to
make during a given time period.

   - **Default** . A developing country is said to be in default when it fails to make the repayments of
principal and/or interest specified in its loan contract and has no intention of repaying in the future.

   - **Moratorium.** A developing country announces its refusal to make the payments of principal
and/or interest specified in its loan contract until it can come to an agreement over future
repayments with its creditors. A moratorium differs from default in that the debtor has
the intention to continue repayments later on provided it can reach suitable repayment
arrangements with its creditors.

   - **Debt rescheduling** . !is occurs when all or part of the repayments of principal and/or interest
due on outstanding debt are postponed to some date in the future. Importantly, when debt is
rescheduled interest is payable on the postponed repayments.

   - **Debt provisioning** . !is is the term used when banks decide to set aside funds into their reserves
to cushion themselves against the costs of a debtor nation defaulting on part of its obligations. !e
provisioning does not alter the contractual obligations of the debtor to repay its borrowing.

   - **Debt forgiveness** . !is occurs when the creditor writes off part or all of the principal and/
	 - r interest payable on an outstanding loan. Debt forgiveness thereby reduces the contractual
	 - bligations of the debtor.

15.7 BACKGROUND AND ORIGINS OF THE DEBT CRISIS

Although the debt crisis $ared up in the early 1980s, the developing countries had previously defaulted on

loan repayments in the 1930s. Bolivia had defaulted in 1931 and was followed by most other Latin American

countries during the next three years. !e effect of these defaults was to make developed countries extremely

wary of lending to the developing countries on other than a short-term basis right up to the 1970s. Nevertheless,

a great deal of direct investment in developing countries took place in the 1950s and 1960s, especially with a

view to exploiting their raw material resources which were a necessary base for reconstruction and economic

growth in the developed countries. !e main threat posed to such investment was that of excessive taxation

- r even nationalization by the developing country concerned.

!e origins of the debt crisis date back to the oil price shock following the Egypt–Israel war of October 1973.

!e quadrupling of the oil price was particularly harmful to the non-oil-producing developing countries, who

experienced an enormous increase in their import expenditure, and on top of this the resulting recession in

developed countries severely curtailed their export earnings. As a result of this the current account deficits of

the developing countries rose from \$8.7 billion in 1973 to \$42.9 billion in 1974 and \$51.3 billion in 1975. !e

terms of trade index of oil-importing developing countries deteriorated substantially between 1973 and 1975

from 100 to 40; this meant that in 1975 they needed two and a half times the amount of export volumes for

every unit of imports than they had in 1973.

While the oil price rise put the developing and developed countries' current accounts into heavy deficit,

the counterpart of this was that the OPEC members experienced a massive increase in their current account

surplus which rose from \$6.2 billion in 1973 to \$66.7 billion in 1974. !e absorptive capacity of the OPEC

economies was such that this enormous increase in their incomes could not all be spent on increased imports

- f investment and consumption goods. In consequence, they placed much of the so-called 'petrodollars' on
the London and New York money markets. OPEC members preferred to deposit their money with developed
countries' financial centres rather than lend directly to oil-importing developing countries because they

- ffered a security and range of investment opportunities for their funds that the developing countries could
not compete with.

!e enormous funds received by London and US banks raised the issue of how the banks could profitably

utilize the money. !e rise in in$ation resulting from the oil shocks meant that real interest rates in

industrialized countries were either low or even negative. By contrast, developing governments were keen to

avoid having to adopt de$ationary measures to control their current account deficits; instead, they sought to

borrow funds to finance the deficits. !e alternative of an IMF adjustment package that would have severely

curtailed economic growth was not considered particularly appealing.

!e view prevalent among the international banking community, that Latin America was set for high rates

- f economic growth, led to a 'recycling' of the petrodollars in the form of massive lending to the developing
countries. Most of the loans made to these countries were made in dollars by syndicates of international banks
with $oating rates of interest based upon a margin over dollar LIBOR. Banks preferred to lend at $oating rates

- f interest because the rates they paid on their deposits were variable; they were keen to protect themselves
should the rates of interest they had to pay on deposits rise. !e other side of the coin was that it le( the
developing countries exposed to the risk of a sudden rise in world interest rates. Since the vast majority of
developing countries' borrowing was public or publicly guaranteed, the banks regarded the risk of any default

- n the debt as being negligible. It is of note that, at the time, the recycling was highly praised by governments
and international institutions, although the IMF was more cautious.

366

The Latin American Debt Crisis

15.8 THE EMERGENCE OF THE DEBT CRISIS

Although developing countries' indebtedness rose substantially from \$130 billion in 1973 to \$336 billion

in 1978, the developing countries were experiencing healthy rates of economic growth and not having any

particular di'culties in servicing their debts. However, a number of unfavourable factors led to a rapid

deterioration of their indebtedness and ability to service their repayments over the following four years.

In 1979 the OPEC cartel more than doubled the price of oil from $13 to $32 per barrel. Industrialized

countries' response to this second oil shock was more uniform than that following the first oil shock: they were

determined to reduce the in$ationary consequences, even if this meant an increase in their unemployment

levels. At the end of 1979 the US authorities adopted a tight monetary policy designed to control its in$ation

rate, with the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Japan adopting similarly tough policies. By contrast, the

developing countries preferred to borrow further funds and their outstanding debt nearly doubled from \$336

billion in 1978 to \$662 billion in 1982. Cline (1984) has estimated that higher oil prices accounted for a \$260

billion increase in non-oil-producing less-developed country debt.

In addition to increasing indebtedness, there was a substantial rise in interest rates due to a rapid rise in

the US budget deficit, with the dollar LIBOR interest rate rising from 9.5 to 16.6% between mid-1978 and

mid-1981. !e rise in interest rates was one of the major factors contributing to the severe world recession

- f 1981 to 1983. In turn, the recession had a devastating effect on the developing countries because it both
dramatically reduced their export volumes and reduced the price of their exports, leading to a substantial
fall in their export earnings. In addition, the recession induced the developed economies to adopt a more
protectionist stance vis-à-vis imported goods which further squeezed developing countries' export earnings.
Table 15.1 shows the evolution of the current accounts of the big four debtor nations.

!e high US interest rates and borrowing had two other effects. First, bankers were less willing to lend to

the developing countries because of the increased attraction of lending the money to the USA. Second, the

high interest rates contributed to a rapid real appreciation of the US dollar which in turn meant an increase in

the real value of developing countries' debt-service repayments.

International Finance

!e result of all these factors was that in 1982 most developing countries, particularly in Latin America,

found themselves with record levels of indebtedness and debt-service repayments, while their ability to raise

revenues to finance the repayments had greatly diminished. Much of the borrowing they had undertaken

had not been profitably used for investment purposes but merely wasted on ine'cient state enterprises and

maintaining artificially high consumption levels. Although we concentrate primarily on the external factors

behind the debt crisis there is no doubt that domestic economic policy mismanagement played a major part

in the debtors' problems.

15.9 THE MEXICAN MORATORIUM

!e debt crisis began with the Mexican moratorium which was announced on 12 August 1982. In the early

1980s the Mexican economy was facing a mixture of external and internal problems. Since the mid-1970s

Mexico had been a major oil exporter, and for this reason was a beneficiary of the rise in oil prices resulting

from the 1973–74 and 1979 oil shocks. As the Mexican state both owned and controlled the oil industry,

the revenues from oil sales accrued directly to the government. International bankers, particularly in the

USA, looking at Mexican oil reserves viewed the country as a very safe place to lend money. Given its high

- il revenues the Mexican government was keen to adopt a programme of increased public expenditure for
improving its infrastructure and a variety of social programmes. !e result was that the government ran a
huge fiscal deficit which led to high economic growth. Overall, Mexico experienced a prosperous decade in
the 1970s.

Following the second oil shock some major problems began to confront the Mexican economy. In the

a(ermath of the first oil shock the industrialized countries had taken measures to reduce their dependence

- n imported oil so that their response to the rise in oil prices following the 1979 price shock was more elastic
than was the case in 1974. In addition, the major worldwide recession led to a further decline in the demand
for oil. Mexico's relatively high in$ation rate (27% in 1981) made the peso, which was pegged to the US dollar,
increasingly overvalued. !is, combined with the authorities' fiscal deficit (some 16.2% of GDP in 1982) and
the decline in oil export revenues meant that the country's current account moved into a large deficit (12.5%

- f GDP in 1981 and 6.2% of GDP in 1982).

!e Mexican economy's problems, especially the widely perceived view that its currency was overvalued,

had for some time led to speculation that the peso would be devalued. Speculation against the peso meant

large capital out$ows and a fall in the reserve holdings of Banco de Mexico’s (Mexico’s central bank) reserves.

In a bid to reduce the current account deficit the peso was devalued in February 1982, but the government

failed to adopt other measures to control the deficit such as reducing its fiscal deficit and monetary growth

rate. In such circumstances, the main effect of the devaluation was to give an additional boost to Mexico’s

in$ation rate. !e deteriorating position of Mexico's economy and the lack of confidence in its government's

resolve to reduce its budget deficit made international bankers increasingly reluctant to extend further new

loans to it.

Mexico's ever-increasing debt repayments, while its ability to service them was being undermined by its

reduced export earnings, led to further speculation against the peso and a run on the Banco de Mexico's

reserves. To stop a crisis developing, on 12 August 1982 the Mexican government announced a moratorium

- n its debt repayments until a satisfactory arrangement could be drawn up with its creditors. !e country
requested further new loans from foreign governments and a rescheduling of its principal repayments which
were falling due. In addition, it made a request for loans from the IMF in return for the adoption of an IMFsponsored stabilization programme.

368

The Latin American Debt Crisis

15.10 THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DEBT CRISIS

As a result of the Mexican moratorium international banks began to realize that many other countries were

facing similar di'culties in servicing their debt; Table 15.2 shows the rapid growth of external debt for the

big four debtors.

!e real fear of both the banks and the authorities in the industrialized countries was that if Mexico

went into default they would be quickly followed by other major debtors. Many US banks had more loans

- utstanding in Latin America than the value of their equity, as shown in Table 15.3, and a default by any of the
big four debtor nations could easily have set off a chain reaction of banking failures and provoked a collapse

- f the banking systems in the developed countries. Not surprisingly, both the banks and authorities of the
industrialized countries were determined to avert such a scenario.

Precisely how the banks got so heavily exposed with their developing country lending is not easy to explain

(see Nunnenkemp, 1986, ch. 7 for an extended discussion). In retrospect there were clear $aws in their creditrating procedures and they got somewhat carried away with syndicated loans. As Graham Bird (1989, p. 17)

explains, the most simple and convincing explanation was that the banks made major mistakes:

Certainly, looking back at the 1970s, it appears now that the banks overlent. With the benefit of hindsight,

such overlending can be explained in a number of ways. With little recent evidence of country default,

the banks probably underestimated the risks of lending. !ey probably lacked the information necessary

to calculate such risks and they may have miscalculated the impact of world recession and rising interest

rates on the position of the debtors. Beyond this, a belief that short term lending would enable them

to extricate themselves if necessary and a confidence generated by the fact that other banks were also

lending, as well as a belief that banks would not be allowed to go bust by national and international

regulatory authorities, all had the effect of reducing their perceived risks.

15.11 A SUPPLY AND DEMAND FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSING THE DEBT CRISIS

Modelling the debt crisis is an extremely complex task because so many variables in$uence lending and

borrowing decisions. Nevertheless, the explosion of new lending up to 1981 and the fall off a(er 1982 can

be very approximately modelled using a supply and demand for new loans framework as illustrated in

Figure 15.1. When determining the slope of the supply and demand schedules for new loans, problems are

encountered because of the need to distinguish the effects of interest rate changes on the stock of outstanding

debt. !e demand for new loans comes from the debtor nation and is assumed to be inversely related to the

rate of interest, as a lower rate makes borrowing more attractive to debtor nations. However, it can be argued

that lower interest rate payments, by reducing the debt-service payments on existing debt that a debtor has to

make, may actually lead to a fall in its demand for new loans. If this latter effect is strong this may mean an

upward-sloping demand schedule.

!e supply of loans schedule is given by S and has been drawn positively sloped initially but backwardsloping once interest rates rise to a certain level. !e problem facing the banks is that new lending in the

current period will decrease the incentives for debtors to default today while increasing the potential and

incentives for the debtor to default in future periods. Hence, the banks will only be prepared to supply new

loans in the current period if there is a su'cient rise in the interest rate to compensate. However, beyond a

certain rate of interest there is a danger that debtors may be encouraged to default and, for this reason, above

this interest rate, the banks may be less willing to make new loans, leading to a backward-sloping supply of

new loans schedules.

For the purposes of our basic analysis, we shall assume that the supply and demand schedules have

their)conventional slopes. Figure 15.2 illustrates the supply and demand for loans situation in 1973–82 and

1983–94. In Figure 15.2(a) the supply and demand situation just prior to the first oil shock is represented

lending to the developing countries, and this is represented by a rightward shi( of the supply of loans schedule

schedule so that the interest rate falls. Overall lending increases from _L_ 1 per annum to _L_ 2 while the interest

rates remained fairly low.

!e situation changed somewhat in 1982 and continued right up to 1994. While the demand for funds

may still have been increasing from D2 to D3, there was a large le(ward shi( of the supply of funds from

S2 to S3. !is shi( can largely be explained by the dramatic change in the perceived risks of lending to the

debtor countries resulting from the Mexican moratorium. Another factor accounting for the supply shi( was

the increasing attractiveness of lending funds to countries like the United States due to the need to finance its

increasing budget and current account deficit. As a result, the interest rates charged rose while the volume of

new lending declined.

15.12 THE ECONOMICS OF DEFAULT

Once the enormity of the debt crisis emerged the main aim of the commercial banks and authorities of the

industrialized nations was to avoid one of the major debtor nations declaring a default on its debt obligations.

Much of the handling of the debt crisis can be viewed as the authorities and commercial banks of developed

countries adopting strategies designed to avert such a default, while at the same time attempting to minimize

the financial losses for the banks involved. Since most of the loans taken out by the developing countries were

government or publicly guaranteed, any default would represent a sovereign default; the most important point

about this type of default is that there are no legal remedies available for the creditors to retrieve their money.

Nevertheless, debtor nations are normally very reluctant to default on their loans because the savings in the

way of repayments are usually less than the perceived costs of declaring a default. We now proceed to examine

these potential costs of default.

_The costs of sovereign default_

Since a debtor government cannot be legally brought to account for a failure to repay its external debts, there

must be some perceived costs associated with sovereign default that make countries reluctant to declare a

default. !e three most commonly cited costs of declaring a default are:

 - **Exclusion from future borrowing.** A country that declares a default on its external obligations is
likely to be excluded from the possibility of future external borrowing. !ose foreign creditors that
lose from the default will not be prepared to lend further funds, while prospective lenders will view
lending to the country as especially risky. In addition, creditor governments could prevent the IMF
and World Bank making further funds available to the defaulting nation. Unable to attract foreign
funds for investment purposes, the defaulting nation will be constrained to finance its domestic
investment from its relatively low domestic savings which will limit its economic growth. In addition,
the country will not be able to smooth out the costs associated with adverse economic shocks by
borrowing on world capital markets.

 - **Reduced gains from trade.** One of the major costs associated with default would be that the
defaulting country would face the increased possibility of protectionist trade measures being adopted
against it. !ere would be a risk that its exports could be subject to seizure when passing through
international borders. Gaining trade credit to finance imports will prove di'cult in the light of its
default, which is likely to result in a substantial reduction of the defaulting country's volume of trade
and with it major welfare losses.

 - **Seizure of overseas assets.** Although creditors of the defaulting country would be unable to take the
debtor governments to court, they might be able to persuade their governments to freeze or seize

372

The Latin American Debt Crisis

assets of the defaulting nation which are held within the creditor's legal jurisdiction. Many developing

countries' governments hold large proportions of their gold and foreign exchange reserves with

central banks of the developed nations and they would be worried about the freezing of those assets if

they were to default on loans extended by o'cial creditors.

!e perceived costs of default are especially worrisome for developing countries' governments because they

are very di'cult to quantify and are plagued by uncertainty. A debtor government can only guess the extent

and duration for which its trade volumes and borrowing capacity would be undermined. !e costs of an

individual debtor going into default while other debtors do not are likely to be particularly high, especially as

creditors would want to demonstrate to other debtors that default is a costly option. If all major debtors were

to declare default, the creditor nations would have considerably less scope to adopt penalties. !is being the

case, the creditor nations would have incentives to avoid the formation of debtors' cartels.

_The benefits of default_

!e benefit from the debtor nation's viewpoint of defaulting is that it saves both the repayment of principal

due and the interest due on its outstanding debt. Such a sum represents the debt-service repayment:

_DS_                - _P_                - _rD_ (15.1)

where _DS_ is the debt-service repayment, _P_ is the principal and interest due, _r_ is the rate of interest and _D_ is

the stock of debt remaining. Equation (15.1) states that the debt service to be paid is the principal and interest

due, plus the interest payment on the stock of outstanding debt.

Although the debt-service ratio represents the payments that the debtor will be expected to make, it does

not represent the net repayment, which is the debt service less net new loans received, which is known as the

net resource transfer ( _NRT_ ) from the debtor to the creditor nations:

_NRT_              - _P_              - _rD_              - _L_              - _DS_              - _L_ (15.2)

where _L_ is the net new loans received by the debtor.

!e net resource transfer in this simple model can be thought of as the net saving or benefit from defaulting

- n the debt. Let us assume that the perceived costs of default are some constant value C. !is being the case,
the country will not default so long as the net resource transfer is less than the perceived costs of default.
A)country will not default on its debt provided:

_NRT_              - _P_              - _rD_              - _L_              - _C_ (15.3)

while a country will default on its debt if:

_NRT_              - _P_              - _rD_              - _L_              - _C_ (15.4)

Notice that, according to equation (15.4), since the costs of default are positive, a debtor will only consider

default if the net resource transfer from the developing countries to its creditors is positive. In other words, the

debtor's debt-service payments exceed the new loans that it receives, implying a positive benefit from default

that exceeds the positive costs of defaulting.

373

International Finance

Equations (15.3) and (15.4) are very important in understanding the various strategies adopted by banks to

encourage the debtor nations not to default. To avoid default the banks must keep the benefits of default lower

than the costs of default, and this can be done by either raising the perceived costs of default or reducing the

costs of servicing the debt. Commercial banks can persuade debtors not to default by a variety of mechanisms.

!ey can reduce the principal repayments due by restructuring debt repayments over longer time horizons;

they can reduce the interest rate repayments due on the stock of outstanding debt; or they can reduce the

stock of debt outstanding or engage in new lending. All these methods of reducing the perceived benefits from

defaulting have cropped up in one form or another in the management of the debt crisis.

15.13 THE ROLE AND VIEWPOINTS OF THE ACTORS IN THE DEBT CRISIS

!ere were very divergent views on the nature and extent of the debt crisis and these differences led to

differing perspectives on how best to manage the crisis. !ese viewpoints were partly coloured by the differing

interests of the four major actors involved: the international banks that lent the funds; the authorities of

the developed nations; the international institutions, notably the World Bank and the IMF; and the debtor

nations. We shall brie$y overview their perspectives and roles in the crisis, although we need to be wary of

treating these actors as homogeneous groups. For example, the international banks that lent the money had

differing degrees of exposure, faced differing regulatory and tax regimes and o(en had diverse views on the

appropriate policy response. Likewise, the debtor nations had differing degrees of indebtedness, repayment

burdens and prospects with regard to debt repayment. As for the national authorities, their economies had

varying degrees of trading links and different historical and strategic relationships with the debtors.

_The commercial banks_

!e immediate reaction of international banks to the emergence of the debt problem was to view it as primarily

a 'liquidity crisis'. Bankers believed that high interest rates and a large amount of principal repayments falling

due, combined with adverse economic conditions, had meant that the debtor nations were finding themselves

in only short-term di'culties. To support this viewpoint it was argued that the debt profile of the debtors

was primarily of a short-term horizon and that nations do not go bankrupt. As such, the banks early on

sought solutions based upon restructuring the debtors' repayments to give the debtors more time to pay.

Banks initially preferred rescheduling debt repayments and at the same time sought to ensure that additional

interest was paid on the postponed principal repayments. Following the onset of the crisis the banks were very

reluctant to extend new funds to the debtors given the precarious position of their outstanding loans; many

bankers took the view that extending new loans to the debtors was 'throwing good money a(er bad'. Despite

this, the banks realized that without new loans the incentives for the debtors to default would rise and so some

further lending was an essential part of the restructuring packages designed to avert default.

Bankers were opposed to granting any debt forgiveness for a number of reasons. !ey argued that granting

forgiveness to one country would lead other debtors to seek similar relief. Also, debt relief might discourage

the debtors from taking the measures necessary to improve their economic performance to ensure they would

qualify for debt relief. In addition, bankers argued that granting a country a degree of debt relief would brand

it as uncreditworthy so that new loans to the country would dry up. In summary, the view of the banking

community was that granting debt relief was too costly for banks to contemplate and ultimately harmful to

the debtor nations themselves. Banks argued that any new lending to the Latin American countries should

be carried out by the national authorities of the industrialized countries and international institutions. !e

374

The Latin American Debt Crisis

banks were also keen to treat each debtor on a 'case-by-case' approach, motivated not only by a belief that

the circumstances facing each debtor were different but also because the different creditor banks had varying

degrees of exposure to each debtor, making a uniform solution impracticable.

_National authorities_

!e national authorities of the industrialized countries were primarily concerned to avoid a calamitous collapse

- f their banking systems which could result from a default by one of the major debtors. However, they were
also extremely wary of utilizing public funds to ease the debtors' plight. Authorities did not wish to be seen
to be 'bailing out' the commercial banks whose lending had gone bad. In addition, any significant assistance
would be extremely costly and be at the expense of reduced public expenditure or increased taxes. A general
feeling was that further loans by the authorities would not help when the problem of the debtors was having
too much debt already. Nevertheless, the authorities (especially the US administration) had strategic and
economic interests in Latin American debtors, making it impossible for them to be indifferent to the debtors'
plight. Rather than get involved in lending new money to the developing countries, most authorities were
prepared to allow some tax concessions for the provisions that banks made against possible losses on their
lending. In addition, authorities were prepared to increase the amount of capital available to the World Bank
and the IMF for lending to developing countries. Channelling funds via these institutions was considered
useful because both the World Bank and the IMF could ensure that developing countries undertook the
appropriate measures to reform their economies; developing countries nearly always ensure repayment of
funds to these institutions.

_The IMF and the World Bank_

!e two main international institutions involved in the debt crisis played somewhat differing and at times

con$icting roles, although in the later stages there was a more coherent policy stance. !e World Bank was

very much concerned about the sheer size and extent of the debt crisis, and particularly the costs in terms of

slower development that debt repayments impose upon the debtor nations. On the other hand, the IMF saw

its main role as ensuring that the debtor nations that came to it for assistance adopted the tough economic

measures required to improve their longer-term ability to service their debt. Another role played by the IMF

was to ensure that creditor banks continued su'cient new lending to the debtor nations to make it worthwhile

for the debtor nations to accept an IMF-sponsored adjustment package.

From time to time the two institutions came into con$ict over the handling of the debt crisis, the World

Bank criticizing the IMF for setting too severe economic adjustment programmes and to some extent

infringing upon the Bank's traditional domain. Overall, the direct financial impact that the two organizations

could make was very much limited by the amount of finance they had available. !e World Bank had to be

careful not to undermine its AAA credit rating by over-extending itself to the SIMICs, while the amount of

short-term finance provided by the IMF was quite limited compared to the extent of the debt crisis.

_The debtors_

!e debtors to a large extent viewed the crisis in which they found themselves as not of their making but due

to a combination of external factors beyond their control. As such, they felt that the creditor banks should

allow some degree of debt forgiveness in the form of reducing the stock of debt owed by the debtors and/

- r reduced interest rate repayments below market rates. Surprisingly, attempts to form a debtors' cartel to

375

International Finance

improve their bargaining positions vis-à-vis the creditor banks did not come to anything. !is was partly

because the debtors had differing debt problems and so were unable to agree on the way they could best be

helped; in addition, the debtors were in competition with one another for whatever new lending was available,

and creditor banks were careful to treat them on a case-by-case basis rather than as a group. !e debtors

consistently argued their need for some debt forgiveness as an incentive to make economic adjustments.

Without such relief they would have little incentive to adjust as all the improved economic performance

would go to creditors to pay off their debts.

15.14 THE MANAGEMENT OF THE DEBT CRISIS

!e debt crisis was managed throughout on a case-by-case basis, with the creditor banks dealing with each

debtor nation individually rather than collectively as a group. Banks argued that this was the only realistic

- ption because the problem confronting each of the debtors had its own particular characteristics, requiring its
- wn solutions. Another advantage of this strategy from the viewpoint of the banks is that it helped to prevent
the formation of a debtors' cartel that would have resulted in an increased bargaining weight of the debtor
nations. Despite this, however, there were common characteristics in the treatment extended to the debtors.
!e management of the debt crisis can be divided up into three distinct phases: (1) the crisis-management
phase of 1982–October 1985; (2) the Baker Plan phase of October 1985–March 1989; and (3) the post-Brady
Plan phase of March 1989–94.

_Phase 1: Crisis management, 1982–October 1985_

Bankers initially perceived the crisis as a temporary 'liquidity' problem rather than as a solvency problem. It

was argued that the debtors were facing a temporary financing problem due to the rise in US interest rates and

a squeeze on their export earnings. As such, the main strategy was to reschedule the debt repayments falling

due, in order to avoid an outright default that would seriously threaten the financial stability of exposed banks

and the banking community in general. A number of short-term debt rescheduling packages were arranged,

the main features of which included a short-term (two to four years) maturity structure on the rescheduled

debt, with interest and fees chargeable for the rescheduling. An important point about the rescheduling

agreements was that the banks only lent money so that the debtor countries could continue to service their

debts – so-called 'involuntary lending' – with the result that all voluntary lending suddenly ceased.

It is important to note that debt rescheduling packages were not unconditional: the debtor had to accept

an IMF adjustment programme as part of the package, there being no point in extending new money to the

debtors unless there were improved prospects of debt-service repayments being made. An IMF adjustment

programme generally has the following features:

!e setting of tight monetary and fiscal targets designed to squeeze aggregate demand in the debtor

economies, the tight fiscal policy being based primarily on reducing government expenditure. !e

tight monetary policy involves the setting of targets for certain monetary aggregates designed to

stabilize in$ation.

A one-off devaluation of the debtor's real exchange rate to improve the country's international

competitiveness.

reduced trade protectionism. !e privatization of state-owned industries is generally encouraged

376

The Latin American Debt Crisis

since it raises finance and is believed to promote greater e'ciency. In the financial sector the removal

    - f interest-rate ceilings resulting in generally higher real rates of return is seen as a better means for

allocating scarce capital and promoting domestic savings.

!e measures have been aptly summed up as 'devaluation, de$ation and deregulation'. Overall, the combination

- f reduced aggregate demand and improved competitiveness from the devaluation is designed to improve
the debtor's current account balance and, thereby, its ability to finance its debt-service commitments. Such
measures are o(en costly in the short term, resulting in low and even negative economic growth, usually
accompanied by increased unemployment and rises in the prices of basic commodities such as food. Not
surprisingly, IMF programmes can be very unpopular with the public in the debtor nations as they invariably
mean reduced living standards.

Evaluation of the crisis-management phase

!e crisis-management phase was almost exclusively about ensuring the financial stability of the banks that had

lent to the debtor countries. As such, it was essential that an outright default by any of the debtors be avoided,

as such a default could have seriously endangered confidence in the banking system of the industrialized

nations. !e problem was that relatively little consideration was given to the needs of the debtor countries

and that further debt in the form of 'involuntary' lending was piled upon already heavy debt loads. !e initial

appraisal of the crisis as a temporary liquidity crisis was also somewhat erroneous – the debt crisis was to

prove far more serious and long-lasting. Table 15.4 shows the evolution of external debt statistics and key

ratios over the period 1982–2002.

!e debtor countries suffered from an immediate drying-up of new bank lending and any funds extended

to them were merely to ensure that they continued to pay their debts. Not surprisingly they suffered greatly

during the crisis management phase and this was one of the factors that prompted the Baker Plan.

_Phase 2: The Baker Plan phase, October 1985–March 1989_

In October 1985 the US Treasury Secretary James Baker announced a major three-year initiative for

managing the debt crisis. !e Baker Plan was launched against a background of increasing disenchantment

- n the part of debtor nations over the recessionary impact of adjustment programmes and the drying-up of
voluntary bank lending. !e Plan endorsed the case-by-case approach to dealing with the debt crisis, that is,
treating each debtor nation in a manner appropriate to its individual circumstances. Baker envisaged debtor
nations 'growing-out' of their debt problems by undertaking market-based structural reforms, including
trade liberalization, cuts in government expenditure and relaxation of regulations relating to inward foreign
investment. An enhanced role for the IMF and World Bank in promoting economic growth was envisaged via
increased and more effective structural adjustment lending, and a target of \$20 billion over the next three years
was set for new lending by the commercial banks to the 15 major debtor nations. Such additional lending by
private banks was supported by a \$10 billion increase in lending by multilateral development banks (mainly
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank).

An evaluation of the Baker Plan

Overall, the implementation of the Baker plan was not considered a success. Voluntary bank lending did

not resume on the scale envisaged by the Plan and even o'cial lending fell well short of its target (see Cline,

1995) with only around \$1 billion of the projected \$10 billion increase being disbursed. Economic growth

in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina stagnated and in$ation rocketed (see Tables 15.5 and 15.6). Although their

current account performance stabilized, their rates of economic growth, levels of investment to GDP and

trade volumes exhibited a significant slowdown. Indeed, the overall levels of indebtedness and many of the

debt service ratios continued to deteriorate.

!e reasons for the failure of the Plan were fairly straightforward – there was little incentive for banks to

extend further new loans when the problem of the region was already viewed as one of too much debt. Also,

the Plan offered little incentive for the debtors to undertake new investment since any improved economic

performance would merely result in increased payments to the creditor banks. As a result of economic hardship

many countries were not in full compliance with the existing IMF programmes and were in continual dispute

with the IMF over the content of stabilization programmes.

The shift from Baker to Brady

!e failure of o'cial agencies to resolve the crisis meant that the banks increasingly sought other means of

resolving their di'culties. From the mid-1980s a secondary market for developing-country debt emerged on

which the creditor banks could sell their outstanding loan assets to third parties (mainly other commercial

banks) at a discount to its face value – the size of the secondary market was estimated by the IMF to be

380

The Latin American Debt Crisis

approximately \$5 billion in 1985 and \$30–40 billion in 1988. Part of the secondary market is made up of

swaps between banks which enable them to reshu%e their loan exposure portfolios to various countries. !e

price of secondary debt of the 15 SIMIC (1994 classification) debtor nations plummeted from an average

70 cents to 35 cents per dollar over the period of the Baker Plan, re$ecting the increasing probability that a

significant proportion of the debt would eventually have to be written off. One of the reasons behind the rising

discount was a Brazilian moratorium on its debt repayments announced in February 1987 which increased the

perception that the debt crisis would be di'cult to resolve without some form of debt reduction. Worsening

market valuations made it increasingly untenable for banks not to make provisions against the loans.

Following the Brazilian moratorium, Citicorp – the major US bank – announced in May 1987 that it

was setting aside \$3 billion to its loan-loss reserves against its lending to developing countries. Following

the Citicorp announcement, provisioning by other banks became inevitable and other major banks both in

the USA and Europe announced their own provisioning. !erea(er provisioning became a regular feature

in the annual accounts of the major international commercial banks with exposure to the debtor nations.

When a bank made provisions it was purely an accounting exercise with the bank putting aside reserves

against outstanding loans in low-earning but risk-free assets, the reported profit figures being reduced by the

amount of the provisions, so lowering dividend payments to bank shareholders. It is important to note that,

while provisioning prepared the banks for any eventual losses on their outstanding debts, it did not reduce

the contractual obligations of the debtors to repay their debt. In other words, provisioning was quite distinct

from 'writing off' loans, whereby the bank reduces the contractual obligations of the debtor. Nonetheless,

provisioning was an important step to clearing the path to some form of debt forgiveness.

_Phase 3: Post-Brady Plan phase, 1989–94_

A significant reformulation of the strategy for dealing with the debt crisis was signalled by the new US

Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in March 1989. !e case-by-case approach, encouraging debtors to

undertake market-based reforms and the adoption of stable macroeconomic policies, continued to be viewed

as an essential component for resolving the debt crisis. However, in addition to emphasizing the need for new

bank lending, the Brady Plan also explicitly recognized the contribution that voluntary debt forgiveness could

make in resolving the crisis. Brady argued that the path to creditworthiness for many SIMICs required some

debt and debt-service reduction on a case-by-case basis. !e major innovation of the Brady initiative was

its inclusion of o'cial support for debt and debt-service reduction. Both the World Bank and the IMF were

asked to set aside funds for this purpose to be targeted at SIMICs with high external debt problems and that

were undertaking appropriate adjustment programmes. Subsequently, US Treasury Undersecretary David

Mulford set a target of \$70 billion for debt forgiveness on the \$340 billion of debt owed by 39 of the major

debtor nations. !e IMF and World Bank were earmarked \$24 billion of funds that could be used for lending

purposes designed to support countries that adopted appropriate economic policies and where a debt and

debt-service reduction (DDSR) programme was successfully negotiated.

Under the aegis of the Brady Plan, 25 DDSR agreements were concluded with some 23 countries by

December 1995. A summary of the results of various DDSRs between 1988 and 1994 is shown in Table 15.7.

Between 1989 and 1994 some \$370 billion of debt was restructured and \$100 billion of debt forgiven in

aggregate. Some \$224 billion of restructuring was concentrated on the severely indebted countries, with \$56

billion forgiven. !e DDSRs have been characterized as 'loans for bonds' deals, whereby bank-loan claims

were replaced by bond-holding claims. Mexico negotiated a DDSR in March 1990, followed by Venezuela in

December 1990, Argentina in April 1993 and Brazil in April 1994. !e terms of the individual DDSRs varied

but there were common elements.

Each creditor bank was offered a menu of policy options to choose from. !ey could accept a

reduction in the principal owed to them, a reduction in the interest payable or a mixture of the two.

Alternatively, they could opt to preserve the majority of their existing claims but would then be

expected to engage in new lending to the country concerned. In the Mexican deal the reduction on

principal was 35% for the 'discount bond' that maintained the market rate of interest at LIBOR +

13/16%; while for the 'par bonds' that maintained their face value, the interest rate was fixed at 6,%,

well below the then prevailing interest rate of 10%. Alternatively, banks that wished to maintain their

full claim were expected to provide 'new money' equivalent to 25% of their exposure over three years.

2. Restructured debt normally had a long term to maturity, typically 20 to 30 years, and was usually

backed for principal repayment and some interest repayment by a purchase of zero-coupon US bonds

by the debtor nation using a mixture of its own funds and loans from multilateral institutions such

as the World Bank and the IMF. In the Mexican deal, in the event that oil prices rose above \$14 per

barrel (at constant 1989 prices), bond-holders were entitled to some 'claw back', that is, additional

payments a(er seven years.

3. As part of the DDSR the debtor country adopted a medium-term IMF stabilization programme

designed to ensure its debt-repayment capacity and a better macroeconomic performance.

An evaluation of the Brady Plan

Authors such as Claessens and Wijnbergen (1993) pronounced the Brady Plan a 'spectacular success'. !ey

view Brady-type deals as having been particularly successful in reducing high and volatile external transfers to

more manageable and predictable levels. Cline (1995) also sees the Brady Plan as a success because it achieved

significant results at relatively low levels of debt forgiveness of approximately 15% of the overall debt burden

and annual interest savings to the debtor nations of 0.5% to 1% of their GDP, or around 3% of their export

earnings. Cline attributes the success of Brady deals as due to a perception on the part of debtor nations that

there was a more equitable sharing of the debt burden between themselves and the creditor banks. Cline

argues that a clear distinction needs to be made between the ability to pay on the one hand and the willingness

to pay on the other. He argues that debt repayments are usually the lower of these two; throughout the 1980s

the willingness to pay was relatively low compared to the ability to pay because the debtors perceived the

adjustment packages as placing an unfair burden on themselves and being too biased to the needs of the

creditor banks. Brady-type deals and some debt forgiveness by the banks raised the willingness to pay of

many debtors so that payments have become related to the (higher) ability to pay. More recently, Reinhart et

al. (2003) have coined the phrase 'debt intolerance' to capture the idea that certain countries at certain levels

382

The Latin American Debt Crisis

- f debt decide to default, even though they have the capacity to repay, simply because they are not prepared
to make the sacrifices necessary to ensure full repayment. It is noticeable that Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil and
Argentina have a long history of debt defaults. Part of the problem is that, in the short term, governments
in these countries like the boost to public and private consumption and investment that capital in$ows can
bring, but they subsequently dislike the debt-servicing payments that follow in the longer run.

Generally speaking, although the Brady Plan was supposed to be a 'voluntary' system there is no doubt that

much political pressure was applied to the banks to accept some form of debt forgiveness, either in the form of

principal reduction or interest-rate reduction, rather than opting to preserve their existing claims and engage

in new lending. Indeed, in the Brazilian deal the Brazilian negotiators set an effective limit to the new money

- ption; the Argentinian deal ruled out the new money option completely; and considerable moral suasion was
applied to the creditor banks in the Mexican case.

One of the most visible effects of the Brady Plan was that there was a significant return of private capital

into each of the big four debtors in the year following the conclusion of a Brady deal. Furthermore, there

was a significant increase in the value of secondary market prices on outstanding debt (see Table 15.8). !e

- nly real black mark against the Brady Plan was that it took approximately five years to achieve the majority
- f its targets, rather than the three years originally envisaged. Nonetheless, by May 1994 some \$60 billion of
the target \$70 billion of debt had been forgiven, leaving Cline (1995, p. 243) to comment that 'the degree of
performance of the plan's original targets can only be judged as remarkable, especially by the standards of
most efforts at international economic coordination'.

15.15 AN OVERALL EVALUATION OF DEBT CRISIS MANAGEMENT

An overall evaluation of the management of the debt crisis must to some extent be based upon what the

- bjectives of debt crisis management have been. Cline (1995) identified three main objectives behind the
strategy:
Avoidance of a financial crisis and the collapse of the international banking system;

2. Restoration of capital-market access for debtor countries;
3. Minimizing the economic adjustment costs for debtor nations.

With regard to objectives 1 and 2 there is general agreement that the crisis management must be regarded as

a success. A major financial crisis for the international banking system was averted and no debtor opted for

- utright default. !e initial crisis management strategy involving concerted 'involuntary' lending prevented
an outright default and gave time for banks to build up capital reserves and make loan-loss provisions that
ultimately made debt forgiveness a viable strategy.

It can be questioned whether the initial diagnosis of the crisis as one of illiquidity was correct, and whether

insolvency requiring immediate debt forgiveness would have been more appropriate. Certainly, the failure of

the Baker Plan and the success of the Brady Plan is indicative that the debtor countries should have been granted

debt forgiveness at an earlier stage in the crisis. Indeed, David Mulford, the former US Treasury Undersecretary

who worked extensively on the Brady Plan, has stated that, 'in retrospect, Latin America could have suffered

less had the international community been prepared earlier to recognize and work with the reality of the

markets to resolve the crisis' ( _Wall Street Journal_, 21 August 1992). While there is undoubtedly some truth

to this, it must also be recognized that the banks were in no real position to consider debt forgiveness much

before the late 1980s following Citicorp's lead in making provisions. In addition, granting debt relief at an early

stage may well have increased the eventual write-offs and delayed the adoption of sound macropolicies by the

debtor nations. In retrospect, the initial diagnosis of illiquidity rather than insolvency was almost certainly

correct, in that the total amount of debt forgiveness eventually granted has been relatively small.

!ere is some truth to the argument that the majority of the burden was initially placed on the debtor countries

and was too biased to the needs of the creditor banks. A fairer sharing of the burden may have been appropriate,

especially as the crisis in large part was a re$ection of excessive lending by the commercial banks. In the end,

however, banks did share a fair degree of the burden by relinquishing approximately one-third of their claims.

!e 'quasi-voluntary' market-oriented nature of the eventual settlement was an important feature. Had

the banks been forced to write down debt, then they would probably have contested such measures in the

courts, which would have clouded Latin American access to capital markets for years to come. In the end, the

majority of banks voluntarily accepted principal and/or interest rate reduction at a lower rate than they might

have expected from the discount on the secondary market price of the debt during the worst days of the crisis.

!e banks forgave approximately one-third of the money owed, and given that some observers have argued

that the debtors had the capacity but were unwilling to pay back all the debt this must be seen as a reasonable

sharing of the eventual cost.

Another notable feature of the management of the debt crisis was that the banks were not bailed out at

public expense. Although public guarantees exist on some of the Brady exit bonds, the improved economic

policies in the debtor nations, lower debt service ratios and their return to capital market access reduced the

risk of these guarantees being called upon. What is true is that the share of the o'cial sector in the outstanding

debt of the SIMICs increased from 14% in 1982 to around 35% in 1994. However, this mainly re$ected the

lack of new funds made available by the commercial banks post-1982.

384

The Latin American Debt Crisis

!e one area where a question mark hangs over the success of the debt-management strategy is with respect

to the third objective. !e ten years following the start of the debt crisis in 1982 have been characterized as a

'lost decade' for Latin America: investment stagnated and per capita incomes in 1992 were lower in each of the

big four debtors compared to the 1979–81 average (14.1% in Venezuela, 12.7% in Argentina, 5.7% in Mexico

and 2% in Brazil).

!e role of the IMF and World Bank in the debt crisis has been criticized as being too biased in favour of the

creditors and requiring too heavy an adjustment by the debtors. To some extent this criticism is unfair because

the IMF o(en recommended policy measures that the debtor would have had to undertake anyhow. It merely

provided a convenient scapegoat for the debtor government to implement necessary adjustment packages.

!e IMF and World Bank simply did not have the resources to make more than a marginal impact on debtors'

financial positions. Overall, the IMF played a crucial role in coordinating the banks, and its stabilization

programmes were an important ingredient in the successful resolution of the crisis.

!e case-by-case approach taken to manage the crisis was almost certainly justified. A generalized scheme

to settle the debt problem would not have recognized that the economic circumstances and prospects of the

debtor nations were immensely varied. Nevertheless, the recognition of the fact that debtors' circumstances

differed should also have meant that IMF stabilization programmes exhibited a greater degree of variety than the

almost standard package of de$ation, devaluation and deregulation. Furthermore, there needed to be a greater

recognition that there was a large degree of interdependence among the debtor nations; it was no use encouraging

export-led growth by a number of debtors if such measures merely depressed their export prices on world

markets leaving)their export revenues stagnant. For instance, during 1981–85 Latin American export volumes

rose by)25% but the deterioration in their terms of trade meant that their export earnings remained stagnant.

15.16 POST-BRADY PLAN CRISES IN THREE OF THE COUNTRIES

While the Brady Plan was perceived as a great success and as heralding the end of the international debt crisis,

this verdict may have been a bit premature. It is certainly the case that the Brady restructuring plan coincided

with the ability of the international banking system to write down and restructure much of the debt on its

books, and access to international capital markets was also restored to many of the debtor nations. However,

it is less clear that the problem of debt build-up and debt-service was fully dealt with. As Table 15.4 shows,

the level of indebtedness of the big four debtors has continued to rise; and their economic growth rates, as

shown in Table 15.9, remained volatile. Finally, there have been significant post-Brady crises in three of the

countries: Mexico in 1994/95, Brazil in 1999, and more recently Argentina declared the largest-ever default

- n its external debt obligations in January 2002, at the same time as it ended its currency-board link to the US
dollar (see section 11.12 for details on each of the crises). !e Argentinian default in particular means that
some of the post-Brady Plan evaluations need to be reassessed.

15.17 CONCLUSIONS

!e debt crisis arose through a mixture of domestic and external circumstances which varied from debtor to

debtor. Nevertheless, the extent and close timing of debtors' problems suggests that common external factors

played a significant part in the crisis. It is too simplistic to apportion the crisis solely to excessive borrowing

by the debtor nations, since in large part the crisis also re$ected excessive lending by the commercial banks.

Although the crisis was in large part due to a combination of events outside the debtor countries' control,

up until 1989 most of the adjustment burden for managing the crisis fell heavily on the debtor nations.

386

The Latin American Debt Crisis

!ere is some justification in the criticism that initial management of the crisis was too biased towards the

requirements of the creditor banks rather than the needs of the debtor nations. However, following the Brady

Plan the banks did forgive a substantial proportion of the money owed as part of negotiated DDSRs. In the

end, debt forgiveness was crucial in improving the willingness as well as capacity to pay of the debtor nations,

particularly as debt reduction was linked to economic reform in those nations. Indeed, debt reduction

provided a significant incentive for the debtor nations to undertake economic reform as it guaranteed them a

share in any resulting future economic prosperity.

!ere are numerous lessons to be learnt from the debt crisis and its subsequent management. Most

importantly, banks need to be far more discriminating in making sovereign loans in the future and must

avoid leaving themselves over-exposed to one particular country or region. Also, when lending funds to

governments, careful consideration should be given as to whether the loans are being put to productive use by

the government concerned or whether they are merely being used to finance extravagant social programmes.

In addition, banks and creditors need to consider not only a country's capacity to repay loans, but also the

likely willingness to repay them in times of economic di'culty.

Another lesson that emerged is that in times of crisis, international organizations such as the IMF and

World Bank can play a critically important role in encouraging the adoption of sound macroeconomic

policies in debtor countries and in coordinating private-sector claims. Indeed, many debtor countries have

discovered that sound domestic economic policies are ultimately crucial to better economic performance,

and by building up confidence they can play a critical role in helping a country regain access to international

capital markets.

!e debt crisis signalled by the Mexican moratorium of 1982 could have resulted in an unprecedented

crisis for the industrialized nations' banking systems, but by the early 1990s they were in a position to

engage in write-downs and restructuring of debt such that the debt crisis no longer presented a threat to the

international financial system. !e management of the debt crisis involved a mixture of debt write-off by the

equity investment and foreign direct investment following the conclusion of Brady deals meant that capitalmarket access for most debtors was restored in just over a decade, which compares very favourably with the

four decades of cut-off that followed the Latin American defaults in the 1930s. However, the Argentinian

default in 2002, the related problems in Brazil in 1999 and even the Mexican crisis of 1994/95 show that the

issue of external debt is always a threat to the stability of output and economic prospects of countries that have

high external debts.

16.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we examine one of the most important economic issues ever tackled by the European Union

(EU),)namely the creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU). On 1 January 1999 EMU was finally

realized in Europe when 11 founding countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,

Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) agreed to irrevocably fix their exchange rates with no margin

- f $uctuation and to replace their national currencies with a new European currency called the euro, which
happened three years later on 1 January 2002. !e original 11 have since been joined by Greece (1)January 2001),
Slovenia (1 January 2007), Malta and Cyprus (1 January 2008), Slovakia (1 January 2009), Estonia (1)January
NaN., Latvia (2014) and Lithuania (2015), bringing the total membership to 19 countries. !is means that
eight countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden) are EU
members but have not yet adopted the euro. !e United Kingdom and Denmark both negotiated 'opt-outs'
from the EMU project and Sweden has a _de facto_ - pt-out. !e UK has since departed the European Union on
1 January 2020 and is therefore unlikely to be part of any eurozone for the foreseeable future. However, all the
new members of the EU that have joined since the commencement of the EMU have in principle agreed to
adopt the euro at some point in the future as part of their accession agreements. !e euro area population in
early 2021 covers some 342 million citizens which is higher than the US population of 330 million.

Despite its successful realization, some ten years a(er its commencement the eurozone faced a severe test,

the so-called the 'eurozone crisis', which called into question the viability of the entire project. !e problem

- f the so-called PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) dominated the news headlines following
- n from the 2007 financial crisis. !e eurozone crisis involved bailouts of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and
Spain and, in the case of Greece's second bailout on 21 February 2012, involved large losses for private-sector
holders of Greek debt who took nominal losses of 53.5%, which equated to 78.5% in net present value terms

- nce restructuring of the remaining debt was taken into account (as determined by an auction of the debt on
19 March 2012).

!e crisis has also necessitated a redesign of the EMU project to address some of the $aws that were

inherent in its original design and to strengthen its capacity to withstand future crises. As we shall see, as part

- f the redesign the eurozone members have agreed to new rules which have significantly limited their freedom
with respect to fiscal policy to a much greater extent than the originally agreed and largely ineffective 1996
Stability and Growth Pact. !e Fiscal Stability Treaty that was signed on 1 March 2012 and which came into
effect on 1 January 2013 places very tight constraints on the fiscal deficits of eurozone countries. In addition,
there has also been a new intergovernmental organization in the form of the European Stability Mechanism
(ESM) set up to manage future 'bailouts' which strictly speaking had been ruled out in the Maastricht Treaty.
!ere were also two key reports aimed at strengthening the EMU in December 2012: a report entitled _Towards_
_a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union_ was followed by a second report in June 2015 entitled _Completing_
_Europe's Economic and Monetary Union._ !is has led to two new initiatives to reinforce the EMU framework:
the creation of a Banking Union and a Capital Markets Union. !e Banking Union has the objective of
creating a safer and sounder banking sector, especially for those countries sharing the euro, while the Capital
Markets Union has the objective of improving investment and savings $ows across the Union to the benefit of
businesses and households and to lower the dependence of the eurozone on the banking sector.

In this chapter, we will review the history behind the EMU and spend some time looking at the features

and operation of its predecessor, the European Monetary System (EMS), which commenced operations in

March 1979 and ultimately proved to be the vehicle for the achievement of EMU. We will describe the EMS

and evaluate its performance during its years of operation, including an analysis of the major crises that

confronted the system in 1992/93 and the convergence process in the run-up to EMU. We will then look

at the economic gains/losses from EMU, including some controversial empirical research on the topic. We

review the various safeguards that were originally put into place to ensure that the euro would be a sound lowin$ation currency, with particular focus on the Stability and Growth Pact. We will look at the arrangements for

the management of the euro under the so-called eurosystem. !is is followed by an analysis of the eurozone

crisis that started in January 2009 and the required bailout packages for Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Spain.

We also look at various solutions being put forward to resolve the crisis. Finally, we look at some of the issues

raised by potential new entrants into the EMU, distinguishing between the cases of the United Kingdom and

the 12 new countries which joined the EU in 2004 and 2007.

16.2 THE SNAKE IN THE TUNNEL

Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, there was a great deal of concern at the

community level that if the European Economic Community (EEC) (as it was then called) countries allowed

their exchange rates to be determined solely by market forces there might be large and sudden changes

in international competitiveness associated with exchange rate movements that could undermine the

development of free trade within the community. Indeed, it was feared that there might even be deliberate

competitive depreciations by some countries to gain trading advantage, which could result in trade frictions

and the emergence of protectionist pressures within the EEC and possibly threaten the existence of the

community itself. In addition, following the Werner Report of 1972 (see section 16.14), the member countries

- f the EEC had set a target date for achieving EMU by 1980. As a result of these fears and a desire to introduce
a single currency as well as some degree of exchange rate stability, EEC members set up the so-called 'Snake
in the Tunnel' which subsequently became the plain 'Snake'.

!e Snake system has been characterized as a mini-Bretton Woods. It commenced operations on 24)April

1972 and was made up of the original six EEC members (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands

and Germany); on 23 May 1972 the UK and Denmark joined and Norway became an associate member.

While the member currencies could vary by a maximum of ±1.125% against each other (the Snake) they

could $oat by ±2.25% against the US dollar (the Tunnel) as permitted by the Smithsonian agreement. !is

smaller margin of $uctuation for the member currencies vis-à-vis each other than was permitted against the

US dollar gave rise to the term 'Snake in a Tunnel' to describe the system. Indeed, between 1972 and 1976

Belgium and the Netherlands limited the divergence between their currencies to ±0.75%, and this became

known as the 'worm inside the Snake'!

!e Snake system had a chequered history; the UK abandoned its membership a(er just six weeks and was

followed four days later by Denmark, which subsequently rejoined in October 1972. Italy withdrew from the

Snake in February 1973 and the Tunnel was demolished in March 1973 when the Snake currencies decided on

a joint $oat against the dollar. In April 1973 as part of the Snake system the European Monetary Cooperation

Fund (EMCF) was set up to provide credits and support for deficit countries. France le( the system in

January 1974, rejoined in July 1975 and le( again in March 1976. Norway le( the system in December 1978.

!roughout its lifetime the Snake was characterized by a series of devaluations and revaluations which are

listed in Table 16.1. !is, coupled with the fact that both Italy and France were out of the system, meant that

by 1979 the Snake was looking badly mutilated. In the end, the Snake system failed to produce the necessary

degree of coordination of economic policies and convergence of economic performance required for its

successful operation.

16.3 THE BACKGROUND TO THE EMS

On 17 June 1978, at a conference held in Bremen, six of the community countries committed themselves

to the setting-up of the EMS to replace the Snake. !e EMS aimed to provide a 'zone of monetary stability'

bringing back into the fold countries like Italy and France which had le( the Snake. Before looking at the

- peration of the EMS it is worthwhile reviewing the motivations behind its formation.

Yao-su Hu (1981) argues that the formation of the EMS has to be seen in a wider context than simply the

setting-up of an exchange rate mechanism. He argues that the EMS was based upon a convergence of interests

among the EEC countries with regard to a common dollar problem. Under the Bretton Woods system, the

dollar was the major international reserve currency, used as a means of settlement between central banks, for

exchange market interventions and as a vehicle currency to denominate many international transactions. He

argues that the USA was free to run balance of payments deficits to supply the world with the dollars it required.

In return for this freedom from balance of payments constraints, the USA was expected to avoid undermining

the purchasing power of dollars. When President Nixon suspended dollar convertibility into gold in 1971 the

USA had effectively abdicated its responsibility, causing serious economic and financial losses for the Europeans.

!e dollar problem had many facets. As the dollar was pegged by foreign central bank purchases of US

dollars, this led to a rapid growth in the world money supply and thereby contributed to worldwide in$ation.

Also, the depreciation of the dollar a(er suspension of its convertibility meant huge losses for central banks

who had purchased dollars under the Bretton Woods system. In sum, it can be argued that central banks'

experience of purchasing and holding US dollars in their reserves had not been a happy one.

Another motivation underlying the Bremen initiative was a desire to provide a stable framework for the

conduct of European trade. Since the adoption of $oating exchange rates in 1973, there had been very divergent

in$ation rates, economic growth and balance of payments performances between the EEC economies.

European policy-makers were concerned that such divergent economic performances could threaten intraEEC trade, and it was hoped that stabilizing European currencies would lead to a greater convergence of

economic performance and continued growth of European trade.

391

International Finance

!e EMS commenced operation on 13 March 1979 and, despite much initial scepticism about its survival

chances, operated with mixed success for two decades. !e EMS consisted of three main features: (1) the

Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM); (2) the European Currency Unit (ECU); and (3) financing facilities. A

proposed European Monetary Fund was never set up. All members of the EEC joined the EMS, though the UK

did not initially participate in the ERM. We will now brie$y review the three key features as an understanding

- f these is essential to show how the EMU was eventually brought about.

16.4 THE ERM

!e ERM consisted of two parts:

A grid of bilateral exchange rate bands between each of the member currencies which defined

    - bligatory intervention.

2. An individual band of $uctuation (threshold) for each currency against the ECU. !e ECU was an

artificial currency based upon a calculation of a weighted basket of 12 European currencies. If a

currency moved too much against the ECU basket it would lead to the expectation that the authorities

    - f that currency would take policy measures designed to bring it back within its ECU threshold.

_Bilateral exchange rate parities and obligatory intervention limits_

!e bilateral exchange rate aspect of the ERM consisted of a grid of central exchange rates between each

pair of currencies in the ERM. Originally each currency could $uctuate a maximum ±2.25% of its assigned

bilateral central rate against another member currency of the ERM. On the setting-up of the system, Italy was

allowed to join with a larger band of $uctuation of ±6%; a similar ±6% was applied when Spain joined in June

1989, the UK in October 1990, and when the Portuguese escudo entered the system in April 1992. However,

following an exchange rate crisis on 2 August 1993 there was a widening of permissible $uctuation margins

to ±15% for all currencies. Table 16.2 shows the central rates of the grid that also became the fixed bilateral

conversion rates between the euro countries announced on 2 May 1998.

Within the bilateral margins authorities could intervene if they wished, though it was not compulsory.

**Intra-marginal** intervention was carried out in either EMS or non-EMS currencies (normally the US dollar).

Once two currencies reached a bilateral exchange rate margin the authorities of the two currencies were

- bliged to intervene or take economic policy measures to keep the currencies within their bilateral limits.
At the outset of the system, the intention was that obligatory intervention should take place in the relevant
EMS currencies rather than in US dollars. For example, if the French franc was at the bottom of its bilateral
limit against the Deutschmark, the French and/or German authorities would sell Deutschmarks and purchase
French francs rather than the French use dollars to buy francs. An important feature of the ERM was that any
changes in the grid of central rates required 'mutual agreement'. In practice, this meant that parity changes
were taken by the finance ministers of the currencies participating in the ERM.

16.5 THE ECU AND ITS ROLE AS AN INDICATOR OF DIVERGENCE

A key component of the ERM was the ECU which, between 1979 and 1999, was a weighted basket of 12

member currencies; the 12 currencies being those of the 12 members prior to the entrance of the three new

members. !e ECU acted as an 'indicator of divergence' within the ERM. Once a bilateral margin was reached,

punt, ITL is Italian lira, NLG is Netherlands guilder, ATS is Austrian schilling, PTE is Portuguese escudo, FIM is Finnish markka.

(b) It is possible to calculate any permanently fixed bilateral parity from the above gird; for example, Italian lira per French franc is

990.2/3.35386 = 295.183, which is also shown in the grid (FRF 1 = 295.183 ITL).

requiring compulsory intervention, a question arose as to which authority was responsible for intervention. In

the case where the French franc reached its lower bilateral limit against the Deutschmark, should the Banque

de France use its reserves or raise French interest rates to support the franc? Or should the Bundesbank sell

Deutschmarks and accumulate French francs and/or reduce German interest rates?

!e ECU was nothing more than a calculation of how a currency was doing against a basket of other

European currencies. !e idea underlying the ECU was that it would single out the currency that was

diverging from the average agreed parities before obligatory bilateral exchange rate margins were reached.

In effect, the ECU was supposed to act as an alarm bell – once a currency crossed its divergence threshold

against the ECU the alarm bell is triggered and the authorities of the diverging currency were expected to

take measures to bring its currency back into line. Such action could consist of a change in interest rates

and/or in the monetary/fiscal policy pursued by the country. Unlike reaching a bilateral exchange rate limit,

triggering the ECU alarm bell did not lead to obligatory intervention, only the expectation of a change in

policy stance ( _presumption d'action_ ). Each currency had its own individual divergence threshold against

the ECU dependent upon its weight in the ECU: the greater the currency's weight, the lower its permitted

divergence threshold. !e reason for designing the divergence threshold like this was to correct for the fact

that currencies with a higher than average weight in the ECU tended to $uctuate less against the ECU than

currencies with a lower weight. !is is because the higher a currency’s weight the more the ECU was made

up of that currency, and since a currency cannot $uctuate against itself the less likely it is to $uctuate against

the ECU. To offset this effect, high-weight currencies were assigned lower divergence thresholds than lowweight currencies. Once a currency deviated too far from its central parity against the ECU basket then

the authorities of that currency were supposed to take measures to bring the currency back into line. For

example, once the Deutschmark exceeded its divergence threshold against the ECU, the German authorities

were expected to take measures to bring it back into line. !e idea was that this warning bell would lead to

action by the responsible country and so avoid reaching obligatory bilateral intervention limits which would

provoke speculation about parity changes.

393

International Finance

In practice, the divergence indicator did not necessarily work as intended. For example, it was possible for

four high-weighted currencies in the ECU basket to appreciate against weaker currencies in the system but

keep their same central rate against each other. In such circumstances, they could reach their bilateral parities

against the weaker currencies, even though they had not reached their divergence thresholds with respect to

the ECU.

16.6 FINANCING FACILITIES AND MONETARY COOPERATION

Another key feature of the EMS was that each member of the EMS deposited 20% of its gold dollar reserves

with the EMCF in exchange for the equivalent value in ECUs, the idea being that authorities use ECUs rather

than dollars for their exchange market interventions. Furthermore, since each ECU issued was backed by

dollars and gold it was hoped that ECUs would be extensively used for settlements between EEC central

banks. !e responsibilities of the EMCF were taken over by the European Monetary Institute in January 1994

and by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in 1998.

An important feature of the EMS was that members had access to credit facilities enabling deficit countries

to defend their exchange rate parities and manage transitory balance of payments problems. !ese credit

facilities were as follows:

1. **Very short-term financing:** a credit facility which participating central banks granted to one another.

!is was designed predominately to ensure that EMS members who found their currencies under

pressure had necessary short-term support to intervene to defend their currency. Borrowing had to

be settled within 45 days with the borrower repaying loans made at relevant money-market interest

rates.

2. **Short-term monetary support:** the funds available under this credit facility were intended to meet

financing needs in instances of temporary balance of payments problems. Borrowing was for a duration

    - f three months, renewable for a further two periods at the request of the borrowing central bank.

3. **Medium-term financial assistance:** this facility provided credits for participating countries

experiencing or seriously threatened with di'culties with their balance of payments over the medium

term. Ordinarily no individual country could receive loans of more than 50% of the total committed

ceilings. Medium-term loans were for periods of two to five years and conditional upon the borrower

taking economic and monetary measures aimed at restoring equilibrium to its balance of payments.

16.7 AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EMS

Despite much initial scepticism, many economists were surprised at the resilience and relatively successful

- peration of the EMS. Against this, however, the system was characterized by periods of turbulence making
an overall assessment quite di'cult. !ere are two key areas upon which the EMS has been judged: firstly, as
a zone of currency stability and, secondly, as an anti-in$ation zone.

_Exchange rate stability in the EMS_

In the early days of its operation, some critics of the system viewed it as a 'mere crawling peg', a fixed exchange

rate system with bands in which the central parities are frequently realigned. As Table 16.3 shows, in the first

four years of its operation, exchange rate realignments were both frequent and quite substantial. To a large

extent, the turbulence of the early years was not surprising given that the second oil shock coincided with the

inception of the EMS. However, post-1984 realignments became far less frequent and were much smaller.

Indeed, between January 1987 and October 1992 there were five and a half years of stability with only a minor

devaluation of the central parity of the lira. Cheung et al. (1995) have shown that most realignments in the

ERM can be characterized as attempts to restore international competitiveness; that is, move the exchange

rate to its PPP level.

Following German reunification and the entrance of the peseta in 1989, the pound in 1990 and the escudo

in April 1992, pressures started to build up in the system. In June 1992, a Danish referendum which rejected

Danish participation in the EMU raised doubts over continued progress towards EMU and concern in the

financial markets about the commitment of certain governments towards economic convergence and the

maintenance of their exchange rate parities. In particular, strain brought on by German reunification which

had led to high German interest rates to finance its growing budget deficit and keep in$ationary pressures

under control meant that interest rates for other European countries were forced higher in order to maintain

their exchange rate parities, since German interest rates effectively placed a $oor on other ERM members'

interest rates.

With many European economies in recession, speculators became increasingly sceptical about the

commitment of governments to defend their exchange rate parities via high interest rates. Doubts about the result

- f a French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on 20 September 1992 led to speculative pressure building up
- n the Italian lira and pound sterling. As a response, both the Italian and British governments issued statements
proclaiming they were committed to defending their exchange rate parities. However, due to unprecedented
market pressure, the Italians were forced to accept an effective devaluation of the lira of 7% (a combined 3.5%
devaluation of the lira and a 3.5% revaluation of all the other ERM currencies). However, this was regarded as
insu'cient by speculators and on 17 September a further wave of speculative pressure against the lira, pound
and peseta led to the suspension of the pound and lira from the ERM, while the peseta was devalued by 5%.

In November 1992 further speculative attacks led to the escudo and peseta being devalued by 6%. Foreign

exchange market tensions resurfaced in the first half of 1993 leading to a 10% devaluation of the Irish punt in

February 1993 and an 8% devaluation of the peseta and a 6.5% devaluation of the escudo in May 1993. Further

exchange rate tensions built up within the system in July 1993, and in a last-minute bid to save the system and

remove potential 'one-way bets' the bands were widened from ±2.25% to ±15% as from 2 August 1993.

Despite these periodic crises, authors such as Artis and Taylor (1988, 1994) have shown that both nominal

exchange rates and real effective exchange rates had become less volatile for EMS currencies (kroner, Belgian

franc, lira, guilder and Deutschmark) than for non-EMS currencies (the pound, dollar and yen) since 1979

compared with the first six years of $oating. While it is not surprising that nominal exchange rates became

396

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

more stable, as this is precisely what the ERM is about, the fact that it also holds for real exchange rates is

indicative of the fact that, as well as providing stability for exchange rates, the EMS has also led to a greater

convergence of in$ation rates.

One of the arguments against adopting exchange rate targets has always been that countries would be

forced to adjust domestic monetary policy and interest rates to the needs of maintaining the exchange rate

target. Hence, exchange rate stability would be achieved only at the cost of increased domestic instability.

Interestingly, Artis and Taylor (1994) found that greater stability of exchange rates was accompanied by

increased stability of domestic short-term interest rates for the ERM countries. It seems that countries derived

both greater domestic and external financial stability from membership of the ERM. By contrast, Artis and

Taylor report that non-ERM countries experienced both greater exchange rate and interest rate volatility

post-1982.

Although the EMS resulted in less volatility of real and nominal exchange rates for its members, there is

clear evidence of significant changes in the levels of real exchange rates over time, particularly in the 1980s.

!is is because in the 1980s France, Italy, Denmark and Ireland had higher in$ation rates than Germany,

and the periodic devaluations of their currencies only partly offset these differentials, implying real exchange

rate appreciations of their currencies against the Deutschmark. In the 1990s, however, French in$ation was

generally below German in$ation, leading to much more stability of the real exchange rate.

16.8 THE EMS AS AN ANTI-INFLATION ZONE

By way of background, before we consider the anti-in$ation hypothesis, we should mention that it was a

widely held belief that German in$ation had generally been lower than that of other EU countries because of

the independent status of the German Bundesbank. !e Bundesbank was given a charter in 1957 that required

it to ensure price stability, enabling it to pursue tough monetary policies regardless of political pressures to

in$ate. Having experienced two periods of hyperin$ation in the twentieth century the Germans have a high

aversion to in$ation. Only in the 1990s were other central banks, such as the Banca d'Italia (1992), Bank of

Portugal (1992), Banque de France (1993), Bank of Greece (1993), Bank of Spain (1994) and the Bank of

England (1998), granted similar degrees of independence.

A popular interpretation of the advantages of EMS membership was put forward by Giavazzi and Pagano

(1988) and Melitz (1988). According to this interpretation one of the major advantages of ERM membership

for relatively high in$ation countries such as Italy and France was that participation enabled them to reduce

their in$ation rates more rapidly, substantially and at lower cost than if they had been non-members.

According to this anti-in$ation hypothesis, there are two ways that the fight against in$ation was assisted by

full EMS membership: (i) by giving the authorities an incentive to bring in$ation under control; and (ii) by

affecting private agents' wage and price behaviour.

With regard to the authorities' incentives, both Italy and France (and other members) by making a

commitment to peg their nominal exchange rates against the key low-in$ation currency in the system – the

Deutschmark – in effect pledged to bring their in$ation rates down to the German level. If their in$ation rates

remained higher than Germany’s then they would be penalized by a loss of international competitiveness. Of

course, they could opt for occasional devaluations to maintain their competitiveness, but if France and Italy

were to do so too frequently this would signal to economic agents that the authorities were not serious in

pursuing anti-in$ationary policies. By making a commitment to peg their currencies to the Deutschmark the

authorities made a visible signal of their commitment to an anti-in$ation strategy. So long as they maintained

the peg (tying their hands), they gained some of the anti-in$ation credibility of the Bundesbank.

397

International Finance

!e effect of agents' wage and price behaviour is connected to the authorities' incentive/credibility effect.

Given that their authorities maintained the peg, economic agents in France and Italy learnt that persisting

with high wage and price in$ation demands made their economies uncompetitive. !is would ultimately

lead to job losses and an economic slowdown. Hence, workers had an incentive to lower their wage demands

which in turn resulted in lower in$ation. In addition, employers would resist excessive wage demands since

if they believed that the authorities would maintain the exchange rate peg they would know that the resulting

cost-push pressures would undermine their competitiveness in international markets.

Given the anti-in$ation incentives for both the authorities and economic agents, it was argued that

membership of the ERM assisted in the process of bringing down in$ation compared to non-ERM

membership. !e Italian and French authorities by being members of the ERM were, according to the antiin$ation hypothesis, able to bring down their in$ation rates more substantially and more quickly than could

have been achieved without membership.

While the anti-in$ation hypothesis explained what was in ERM membership for traditionally highin$ation countries, it did not explain German participation in the ERM. Germany, since the Second World

War, had already been a low-in$ation country, and the Bundesbank already had anti-in$ation credibility.

Melitz (1988) argues that the main gain for Germany was that, while the nominal exchange rates were fixed

and other countries still had relatively high in$ation rates, the Germans experienced an improvement in their

international competitiveness due to the resulting real depreciation of the Deutschmark.

!is interpretation of the EMS suggests that all countries got something out of the system, but at a cost. !e

Italians and French managed to bring down their in$ation rates and sustain them at lower rates than had they

not joined the system, but at the expense of some loss of international competitiveness. !e Germans probably

accepted a marginally higher in$ation rate than had they not been EMS members but were compensated

by increased international competitiveness. Some empirical evidence on the validity of the anti-in$ation

hypothesis is presented in Table 16.4.

While there is no doubt that average rates of in$ation came down in the EMS countries, Table 16.4 shows

that this is not by itself proof of the EMS anti-in$ation hypothesis. !is is because in$ation rates also fell in the

non-ERM countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In fact, starting from a similar average

in$ation rate in 1980, the in$ation rate in the non-ERM countries was lower than in the ERM countries up

to 1985. Only during 1986–91 did the ERM countries have a lower in$ation rate; between 1992 and 1998 the

non-ERM countries generally had an even lower than average in$ation rate.

!ere have been several more formal empirical studies of the anti-in$ation hypothesis. As is usual in

these studies, it is not possible to prove the hypothesis that the EMS has helped to reduce in$ation because

it is impossible to know what would have happened in the absence of the EMS. !e most popular method of

seeking supporting evidence for the hypothesis has been to compare the EMS countries' in$ation performance

with that of a group of non-EMS countries, as above. Obviously, such a comparison is not conclusive, and the

results can prove sensitive to which non-EMS countries are chosen for comparison. Ungerer et al. (1986)

undertook an empirical investigation of the EMS countries up until 1984 and found that the EMS had a

significant negative effect on EMS in$ation rates. However, a study by Collins (1988), which compared seven

EMS countries' in$ation performance with 15 non-EMS countries, during the periods 1974–78 and 1979–86,

found only limited and inconclusive support for the hypothesis that the in$ation rate had come down more

significantly for the EMS countries for the whole of the period.

Giavazzi and Giovannini (1988) used a different methodology to test the anti-in$ation hypothesis. !ey

exploited the theoretical predictions of what is known as the Lucas critique. In a celebrated paper, Lucas

(1976) argued that statistical relationships will change according to the policy regime in force. In the context

- f the EMS, the change in policy regime represented by the setting-up of the EMS means that the statistical

parameters governing wage, price and output behaviour in the countries studied (France, Italy, Denmark and

Germany) should have changed, given the discipline of the EMS. Giavazzi and Giovannini did not find that

the statistical relationships changed significantly if mid-1979 was taken as the starting point. If the starting

point was taken as the beginning of 1982, there was some weak evidence of a change in wage and price

behaviour, providing some support for the anti-in$ation hypothesis. !e authors suggest that because of large

real depreciations of the lira and franc in 1978, the French and Italian authorities did not have to accept the

EMS discipline in the early stages of the system. Furthermore, it took economic agents time to learn the

implications of EMS memberships and the authorities time to earn credibility. Only then did agents revise

downwards their wage and price behaviour.

Overall, it appears that one of the reasons for the lack of conclusive support for the anti-in$ation hypothesis

is that for the first three years of its operation it is a seriously defective description of the EMS. !e differential

effects of the second oil shock made authorities very reluctant to accept the discipline of the system, as is amply

illustrated by the frequent realignments and the French dash for growth in 1981. It seems that only a(er 1982

did policy-makers in France, Denmark, Belgium and Italy decide to subject their economies to disin$ationary

policies. For instance, the French government adopted an austerity package in March 1983 and the Italian

authorities repealed wage indexation laws in 1984. !e resulting disin$ation led to both a rapid decline in

EMS in$ation rates and to a greater degree of convergence as compared to the group of non-EMS currencies.

16.9 INTERVENTION POLICY IN THE EMS

Although the EMS was supposed to result in more symmetry with regard to intervention through the

mechanism of the ECU divergence indicator, in practice the indicator did not work particularly well. A study

- f intervention within the EMS by Mastropasqua et al. (1988) showed some interesting asymmetries and
contrasts with respect to intervention behaviour.

!e Bundesbank was generally very active with regard to non-obligatory **intra-marginal intervention** . At

times, however, particularly when the system was on the verge of realignments (such as in January 1987 and

the 1992/93 crises) it was prepared to engage in heavy obligatory **marginal intervention** . !e Bundesbank

was far more active with regard to the dollar exchange rate: it was a large seller of dollars when the dollar

was appreciating during 1980–85 and a large purchaser when it subsequently fell. !e other ERM countries

were far more active with regard to intra-marginal intervention and keeping their currencies in line with the

Deutschmark, which they increasingly used in preference to dollars for such intra-marginal intervention.

!e other interesting finding was that the Bundesbank typically sterilized its interventions so that they

did not affect the German monetary base. !at is, purchases or sales of foreign currency that increased or

decreased the German money supply were typically offset by sales or purchases of domestic bonds so as to

neutralize the effect on the German monetary base. !e other EMS countries normally only engaged in partial

sterilization (30–40%) so that purchases or sales of foreign currency resulted in expansion and contraction of

their domestic money supplies.

!e overall picture that emerges is that the Bundesbank managed the external exchange rate of the ERM

currencies against the dollar, while the rest of the ERM members took responsibility for ensuring that they

kept their exchange rates in line with the Deutschmark, managing the internal parities. In addition, the

Bundesbank by pursuing a sterilization policy generally did not allow its exchange rate policy to in$uence its

money supply and its primary objective of domestic price stability. On the other hand, other ERM countries

accepted the discipline of the system by purchasing their currencies when they were weak to keep them in

line with the Deutschmark and permitting this intervention to result in a contraction in their money supplies.

400

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

Nevertheless, Mastropasqua et al. (1988) emphasized that intervention was only one of the means by which

countries maintained their peg to the Deutschmark. !e most obvious means was to raise their domestic

interest rates when their currencies were under pressure and lower them when the pressure receded. Here,

again, there was ample evidence that countries other than Germany undertook most of the adjustment burden,

the Bundesbank proving very reluctant to reduce interest rates when the Deutschmark was strong. In practice,

far from being a symmetrical system it appears that weak currency members accepted the discipline of the

EMS both with respect to their intervention and domestic economic policies and were prepared to accept the

de$ationary consequences necessary to maintain their exchange rate. In the early years of the system some of

the countries found the discipline too much and realigned their currencies.

16.10 THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF ERM AND NON-ERM COUNTRIES

While there is reasonable agreement that the EMS succeeded in its aim of becoming 'a zone of currency

stability', especially in comparison to currencies that have been le( to $oat such as the dollar, yen and

sterling, there is considerable disagreement over the benefits or otherwise of full EMS membership. Even

if membership of the ERM helped in the fight against in$ation, this may have been at the expense of

countries)having to)adopt de$ationary policies leading to lower economic growth and higher unemployment

than non-members. Table)16.5 shows that economic growth was generally lower for the ERM countries, and

it can also be shown that unemployment rates were generally higher for the ERM countries as compared to

the non-ERM countries.

16.11 WHAT IS MEANT BY ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION?

!ere are two main components to an economic and monetary union between two or more countries: an

exchange rate union and complete capital market integration. By an exchange rate union we mean that the

countries agree to the permanent fixing of their exchange rates with no margin of $uctuation. For all intents

and purposes this is equivalent to the creation of a single currency. Indeed, the creation of a single currency

is the logical outcome of such a situation, emphasizing the permanency of the arrangement. !e second

component of a monetary union is complete capital market integration, which means that all obstacles to the

free movement of financial capital between the union members are removed. Furthermore, capital market

integration requires that equal treatment is afforded to financial capital throughout the members of the union.

While permanently fixed exchange rates and complete capital market integration are explicit requirements

for monetary union, these in turn involve some implicit requirements. One is that the members of the union

harmonize their monetary policies. Differential monetary growth rates once productivity differentials have

been allowed for would lead to differing in$ation rates, which would threaten parity changes undermining

the requirement of permanently fixed exchange rates. When a single currency is brought into circulation,

it requires a union central bank to control its supply and manage the exchange rate of the currency against

third-country currencies. Such a central bank needs to be invested with a pool of foreign exchange reserves

for this purpose.

Hence, a monetary union differs from a fixed exchange rate system in several fundamental respects. A

monetary union is a permanent commitment to peg the exchange rate which logically leads to the creation of

a single currency. Fixed exchange systems allow for occasional realignments and usually permit margins of

$uctuation around a central rate. A monetary union requires a well-developed institutional framework such

as a single union central bank. Finally, within a monetary union financial capital must be allowed to move

freely between the members of the union. !is contrasts with the experience of some fixed exchange rate

regimes whereby exchange rate parities are o(en defended only by resort to capital controls.

16.12 BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION

!e benefits and costs associated with the introduction of a single European currency – the euro – as legal

tender throughout the EU members of the currency union are in nature a mixture of the political, social and

economic.

 - **Stimulus to intra-EU trade.** !e underlying rationale of the EU is that the removal of barriers to
trade by increasing the volume of intra-EU trade will lead to a corresponding rise in the economic
prosperity of its members. To maximize the trade $ows between the EU member states and achieve
a truly single market it is argued that there needs to be a common medium of exchange. Differing
national currencies that $uctuate against one another inhibit trade $ows by increasing uncertainty
facing companies which can only be eliminated by hedging techniques that entail additional (though
not substantial) costs for small to medium-sized companies. !is argument for a currency union
in Europe is particularly important; not only are the European economies particularly open to
international trade as a percentage of their gross domestic product, but also a large proportion of
their trade is with each other, that is, there is a high degree of intra-European trade.

Against this, some have argued that short-run exchange rate uncertainty can be easily hedged

and probably has very little adverse effect on trade (see, for example, IMF, 1984), implying that the

benefits from a single currency may be small. However, Peree and Steinherr (1989) have argued that

the problem is not really short-term uncertainty which can be easily hedged, but rather mediumto

long-term uncertainty (one-year-plus horizon) for which well-developed forward markets do not

exist. !ey find that mediumto long-run exchange rate uncertainty generally exerts a significant

adverse effect on international trade. As a monetary union is, by definition, a long-term arrangement,

the adverse effects of mediumto long-run exchange rate uncertainty would presumably be

eliminated.

A further boost to intra-EU trade comes from the elimination of the transaction costs involved in

converting different currencies for such trade. !ese costs involve the time and resources used up by

firms acquiring and selling the requisite currencies and banks' commission charges. !e European

Commission has estimated the cost savings from elimination of these transaction costs to be around

0.4% of EU GDP per annum. It should be noted, however, that this would involve smaller profits for

banks. Box 16.1 describes controversial research on the impact of monetary unions on trade $ows.

 - **A more efficient allocation of factors of production within the EU.** EMU involved not only the
creation of a single European currency, but also the removal of capital controls and distortions to
the treatment of financial capital among EU countries. !ere is no doubt that the free movement

	- f capital within the EU has in the past been distorted by capital controls and differing national
treatments of financial capital, which has led to a suboptimal allocation within the Union. Capital
controls have typically restricted capital from moving to countries where it has a low marginal
productivity to countries where it has a high one. !e permanent abolition of exchange rate controls
and the absence of uncertainty created by exchange rate $uctuations has undoubtedly led to a more

In a controversial paper, Rose (2000) estimated that the effects of a currency union could increase trade

by as much as 300% in the countries he studied where currency unions had come into being, comparing

the volumes of trade to countries that did not have a common currency. !e paper has come in for

much criticism since it was focused on relatively poor and/or small nations that had formed currency

unions and its applicability to the case of the EU is doubtful, although it nonetheless suggests that the

effects of creating a single currency in Europe could be quite significant. In a follow-up paper, Glick and

Rose (2002) examine the impact of a currency union on those countries that adopt a common currency

using panel data (a mix of cross-sectional and time-series data) and find that it doubles the volume of

trade, which is a considerably lower impact than in the original Rose paper yet still highly significant.

In a recent paper, Micco et al. (2003) using post-1999 data argue that the euro had already increased

trade in the region by 4 to 16%, depending upon the particular methodology used. !ese estimates,

while significantly lower and more realistic than those of Rose (2000) and Glick and Rose (2002),

are nonetheless significant and suggest that the creation of the euro has had a significant economic

impact. !ey also find that the creation of the euro, as well as stimulating intra-eurozone trade, has also

increased extra-eurozone trade (that is, trade with non-euro members). Another interesting finding

is that the impact of the euro on trade $ows really began in 1998, a whole year prior to the actual

permanent fixing of exchange rates.

e'cient allocation of capital within the Union. Similarly, with wages and salaries expressed in terms

    - f a common currency, EMU will result in a better allocation of labour as the latter moves from areas

    - f low-marginal to high productivity regions.

 - **Economizing of foreign exchange reserves and seigniorage benefits.** Dollar Treasury bonds held in
EU member reserves typically earn low rates of interest, with their purchasing power in terms of US
goods being eroded over time by US in$ation. Economizing on the amount of reserves held would
reduce the seigniorage benefits accruing to the USA. Some argue that EMU will reduce the total
foreign exchange reserve holdings of EU countries, since there is no need to hold reserves to manage
intra-EU exchange rates. Furthermore, there is a good chance that the euro will tend to $uctuate less
against third-country currencies than the individual EU currencies. !e reasoning is that the average
economic performance of many countries with the same currency is likely to be more stable than that

	- f the individual countries with their own currencies, implying less need to hold foreign exchange
reserves. In addition, the euro will inevitably become a major world currency, leading to an increase
in the European currency component of non-EU countries' reserves, primarily at the expense of the
US dollar, resulting in corresponding seigniorage benefits accruing to the EU. Cohen and Wyplosz
(1989) have estimated that the gains accruing to the EU from this latter effect could amount to
around 0.75% of EU gross national product. Additional benefits are:

 - **Savings in administrative costs for businesses.** !is is a potentially significant benefit for firms
involved in managing their exchange risk and operating their businesses in many different European
currencies. Different European currencies and $uctuations between them have meant that firms use
up resources in having to monitor their exchange-risk exposure and in revising their pricing strategies
in the different European markets. !e existence of the euro has considerably reduced these costs.

404

 - !is is less talked about but is a
**Greater liquidity and rationalization of financial markets.**
potentially important benefit of EMU for the eurozone area. Prior to the euro, national government
bond and equity markets, while generally very liquid, were to some extent segmented from one
another. Post-EMU, all government debt of the member countries has been denominated in euros
and this has made the government bond markets even more liquid and resulted in a lowering of
transaction costs. Furthermore, there has already been a significant rationalization of equity markets:
now company stocks are all quoted in euros with more equity business done on the most e'cient
exchanges. !e access to cheaper sources of finance and improved liquidity for both governments and
companies is a potentially significant benefit from EMU.

 - **Greater price transparency.** Another gain from having a single currency is that consumers and
businesses benefit from price transparency. Now that all prices in the eurozone countries are quoted
in euros it is more di'cult for manufacturers to maintain significant price differentials in different
markets. Consumers buying from the cheapest sources will, over time, help to ensure that a single
pricing policy biased towards the lower end of the prices charged in different countries is adopted by
many multinationals. !is implies a potential benefit for consumers and businesses at the expense of
reduced profits for some multinational companies.

16.13 COSTS OF EMU

Most of the perceived costs of EMU are not so much associated with the final attainment of monetary union,

but rather with the transitional costs associated in achieving it:

 - **Loss of monetary autonomy.** !e use of a common currency with a European Central Bank, charged
with determining monetary policy and the short-term interest rate on the euro, is the most visible
sign of the main cost associated with EMU. Since EMU has involved the introduction of a single
currency with no capital controls, then a single short-term interest rate has prevailed in the eurozone
countries. !is means real dilemmas for the European Central Bank when setting interest rates, as
it has to reconcile the needs of booming member states with those of member states suffering from
recession. In the absence of EMU, national central banks in booming countries would typically raise
the short-term interest rate to dampen economic activity, while those of countries in recession would
usually reduce the short-term interest rate to boost economic activity. A common interest rate in the
post-EMU era may be insu'ciently high to curtail economic activity in booming countries while
being too high to help countries in recession.

 - **Loss of national macroeconomic policy autonomy.** A major argument against EMU is that the
acceptance of a single currency means that countries are no longer free to determine their own
monetary policies and in$ation rates. In economics it is widely believed that in the short run a trade
	- ff exists between in$ation and unemployment, known as the Phillips curve. Some countries prefer
to have low in$ation rates and are prepared to accept relatively high unemployment, while others
prefer low unemployment and relatively high in$ation. With $oating exchange rates these different
in$ation preferences can be reconciled by an appreciating currency for low-in$ation countries. Since
a monetary union requires common in$ation rates, countries with differing preferences with respect
to any unemployment–in$ation trade-off will lose from monetary union. !is argument is illustrated
in Figure 16.1 that compares the UK and eurozone Phillips curves.

**Figure 16.1** UK and eurozone Phillips curves

Assume that UK policy-makers prefer relatively high in$ation, while the eurozone prefers less

in$ation. !e optimal in$ation–unemployment trade-off for the UK is given by _P_ UK* and _U_ UK*, while

the optimal trade-off for the eurozone area is _P_ E* and _U_ E*. In a monetary union both have to accept a

common in$ation rate _P_ U, which implies higher UK unemployment than UK policy-makers prefer,

and higher eurozone in$ation than the eurozone countries prefer. However, there is much debate

in economics over whether the Phillips curve trade-off exists. Most economists accept that in the

short run such a trade-off usually exists but in the long run does not, with each country having a

vertical Phillips curve at its natural rate of unemployment. Hence, the costs associated with the loss of

national policy autonomy are probably confined to the short run.

 - **Loss of inflation tax.** German agreement to EMU was crucially dependent upon guarantees of a
low in$ation rate in the union. For some governments, especially the 2004 accession countries, the
move to EMU is potentially costly because it is necessary to bring their in$ation rates down and into
line with the low eurozone rate. !is undermines their implicit in$ation tax revenue. In countries
where there is a large amount of outstanding public debt and a large holding of the monetary base,
as opposed to interest-earning bank accounts, the in$ation that results from reducing the real value

	- f both the outstanding debt and the purchasing power of the authorities' monetary base liability
effectively constitutes a tax. !e lower EMU in$ation rate implies a smaller in$ation tax revenue for
high-in$ation countries, meaning that their governments will have to replace the lost in$ation tax
with explicit direct and indirect taxes. In an analysis of this argument, Cohen and Wyplosz (1989)
calculated that the taxation of the monetary base was far more significant for some countries than

	- thers. In particular, assuming a constant 5% in$ation rate, the in$ation tax as a percentage of GDP
was 2.1% for Ireland, 3.9% for Italy and 3.5% for Spain, but only 1% for Germany, 1.1% for France
and 0.7% for the UK and the Netherlands. Furthermore, since Italy and Spain are among the most
heavily indebted countries, the temptation to in$ate and reduce the real value of outstanding debt was
higher in those countries. It should be noted that although explicit taxes tend to be politically more
unpopular than hidden taxes, such as ‘in$ation taxes', from an economic viewpoint the replacement

	- f in$ation tax by more explicit taxes is not necessarily a bad thing.

406

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

 - **Regional disparities.** Another concern over EMU is that while it will probably lead to gains for
the EU as a whole, some countries could gain while others could lose. !e increased movements

	- f capital and labour associated with EMU, as factors move from low marginal productivity areas
towards high productivity areas, could manifest as a regional problem with undesirable social
effects. !is may be particularly important with respect to labour movements, because labour that
leaves low productivity areas is usually the most mobile and productive part of a region's workforce.
To mitigate such adverse regional effects may require a corrective EU regional policy, with those
regions and countries that gain funding compensatory measures in regions that have lost from EMU.
Although some regional disparities may emerge as a result of EMU, it is very much open to debate as
to whether regional policy is the best means of alleviating the problem. Regional policies have fallen

	- ut of favour in recent years for a whole host of reasons; these include political manipulation, the
diversion of funds to ine'cient industries and the delaying of desirable economic adjustments. In
practice, it is di'cult to assess whether a region is in decline because of EMU or for other reasons.

 - **Loss of the exchange rate policy instrument.** Another argument employed against EMU is that the
member countries, by agreeing to a fixed exchange rate within the union, are depriving themselves of
both the exchange rate policy instrument and monetary policy instruments. Tinbergen's instruments–
target rule (see **section 4.13** ) argued that policy-makers generally require as many independent
instruments as they have targets. !e loss of the exchange rate policy instrument and ability to pursue
an independent monetary policy does not matter if the authorities have only one objective, because
they could use fiscal policy to achieve internal balance. However, this leaves the problem of external
balance. !e question of whether the authorities are really losing a policy instrument for dealing with
external equilibrium is not clear-cut. !is is because, for the eurozone as a whole, there is nothing
to prevent the euro $oating vis-à-vis currencies of the rest of the world to ensure that the balance of
payments of the eurozone is kept in equilibrium. Nevertheless, overall external equilibrium for the
eurozone disguises the fact that some member countries may experience persistent deficits and others
persistent surpluses. !e loss of the exchange rate policy instrument is therefore applicable to the
individual eurozone countries.

 - **Transition costs.** !ere are inevitably some transition costs involved in EMU. !ese range from the
costs of calling in existing national notes, the printing of new notes, education and training, changing
information technology systems to cope with the new currency, and altering existing automated
telling and vending machines. !e European Banking Federation (1995a) estimated the costs of the
transition to be 25–40 billion ECUs or roughly 2% of bank costs. !ese are largely 'one-off' costs,
and against these we need to offset certain future benefits such as economies of scale that result from
manufacturers having to deal with only one currency and banks having to deal with fewer currencies,
and so on.

Overall, it is clear that there are some advantages and some disadvantages attached to EMU. Even if the

benefits exceed the costs this does not necessarily imply that EMU is in any sense optimal. !e number of

countries and which ones would constitute an optimal EMU is an open question. Another point to bear in

mind is that there may well be some countries and firms that are winners and others that are losers from

EMU, for which the benefits may be spread thinly over many millions of people throughout the Union, while

the losses are heavily concentrated in particular sectors or countries. Another very important point when

considering the benefits and costs associated with EMU concerns the characteristics of the new European

currency. If the euro turns out to be a low-in$ation and well-managed currency with responsibility for its

issue in the hands of a credible, independent, well-managed ECB, then the case for EMU is strengthened. If,

407

International Finance

however, the euro turns out to be a weak, in$ation-prone currency run by a poorly managed ECB then the

case for EMU is correspondingly weakened. Finally, for past and future potential member states the precise

costs and benefits depend partly on the conversion rates of their currency against the euro – to the extent that

a currency is overvalued in relation to, say, PPP this increases the real purchasing power of the country, but

against this the country may suffer a loss of competitiveness which could contribute to a post-EMU recession

in that country.

16.14 A HISTORY OF THE ROAD TO EMU

!e Treaty of Rome 1957 which created the EEC made no explicit mention of monetary union; however,

the architects of the Treaty no doubt envisaged the EEC eventually developing into a fully-$edged economic

union with full monetary integration among its members. At the time of signing the Rome Treaty, the priority

was the creation of a customs union which involved the adoption of a common tariff policy vis-à-vis third

countries and the removal of trade barriers (especially tariffs) between member countries. By 1968 much

progress had been made in these areas and it was believed that a means of further increasing trade between

members would be the creation of a single European currency. At the Hague Summit of December 1969 the

then six member countries of the EEC agreed in principle to establish complete economic and monetary union

in stages, commencing in January 1971 and being completed by the end of 1980. Although in retrospect such

a target seems absurdly ambitious, it must be remembered that the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange

rates had been operating with only occasional realignments for two decades.

_The Werner Report_

As a result of the Hague Summit of 1969, a committee was set up to investigate the subject, and in 1972

it delivered the so-called Werner Report on Economic and Monetary Union. !e report envisaged a fully$edged monetary union between the members of the EEC by 1980. In relation to the free movement of factors

- f production the report argued for the removal of all impediments and distortions to such movements.
!e report foresaw the conduct of fiscal and monetary policies being carried out at the community level by
community institutions invested with the necessary decision-making powers, the main aim of such institutions
being to regulate the monetary and credit policies of the union and manage the external exchange rate visà-vis non-EEC currencies. Fiscal policy would be employed to ensure both economic stability and growth.
Finally, community institutions would also operate regional and structural policies designed 'to contribute to
the balanced development of the community'.

!e main result of the Werner Report was the Snake in the Tunnel arrangement of 1972 which, as

we have seen, had a very poor track record and was all but finished by 1978. Apart from being overambitious, there were more fundamental reasons for the failure to achieve EMU by the target date. In the

first instance, the six original members were joined by Ireland, the United Kingdom and Denmark in 1973.

!eir accession negotiations and the ensuring of their successful integration into the EEC inevitably took

precedence. In addition, as we saw in Chapter 11, the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates broke

up in 1971 and was swi(ly followed by the first oil shock of 1973/74. !e impact of the oil price rise was

not spread evenly, and coinciding with the new era of $oating exchange rates meant that countries were

free to adopt different policy responses. Some countries, such as the UK and Italy, adopted expansionary

policies in a bid to stave off recession, while others such as Germany were determined to avoid in$ation

and adopted de$ationary policies. With such policy divergences and resulting differential in$ation rates

408

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

any hope of achieving fixed exchange rate parities between European currencies was soon vanquished.

During the period 1971–75 French consumer prices rose by 52%, while in Germany they rose by 34.7%

and in the UK by 82.5%.

Ultimately, the principal obstacle to monetary union was that the heads of state that met at the Hague

Summit failed to deliver the political will and commitment necessary for its achievement. To a large extent

they misunderstood the full implications required to achieve EMU. Put simply, the declaration to achieve

EMU only had a real chance of success if the member states were prepared to sacrifice the macroeconomic

control of their national economies to achieve common in$ation objectives – but the political will to do this

was never present.

_EMS and the Delors Report_

!e EMU project was clearly $agging when in 1978 the President of the European Commission Roy Jenkins

suggested that an EMS be set up to provide a zone of currency stability for the European currencies. As

we have seen, the EMS had a mixed performance in its early days and was not initially viewed as a vehicle

for achieving EMU. However, in 1986 Europe passed the Single European Act with the aim of creating a

single market by 1992. !is in turn led to an inevitable debate about whether a single market would be best

served by a single currency. At a meeting of the European Council in June 1988, the Heads of Government

- f the member countries of the EEC confirmed the long-run objective of economic and monetary union.
A committee of academics and central bankers headed by Jacques Delors, President of the European
Commission, was set up to investigate the EMU issue and propose a strategy for achieving it. !e result

- f the deliberations was the so-called Delors Report of 1989 which set out a broad outline proposal for
achieving EMU. !e Delors Report emphasized that member states would have to be prepared to transfer
decision-making powers to community institutions in the field of monetary policy and be bound to preset
procedures and rules in other areas such as fiscal policy. In particular, it emphasized the need not only for
convergent monetary policies, but also for convergent fiscal policies. !e report argued that monetary union
requires a single currency rather than just irrevocably fixed parities. A single currency would demonstrate
the irreversibility of the move to monetary union, would considerably facilitate monetary management
within the community and would avoid the transaction costs of converting currencies. An EU Central Bank
was viewed as a necessity to operate monetary, credit and interest policy rather than close coordination
between existing central banks. Full liberalization of capital markets and financial market integration were
also viewed as essential.

!e Delors Report took it for granted that the benefits of EMU would exceed the costs, and it was the remit

- f the committee to draw up a set of proposals relating to how such a process might be achieved. !e report
envisaged the attainment of EMU in three stages, each stage representing a significant change with respect to
the preceding one. !e report did not set out explicit deadline dates, but it was subsequently decided by the
European Council meeting in Madrid in June 1989 that Stage 1 would begin on 1 July 1990. Prospective dates
for Stage 2 (1 January 1994) and Stage 3 (1 January 1997 or 1 January 1999) were later agreed at Maastricht and
by the European Council in Madrid in December 1995. !e three stages were as follows.

_Stage 1: the convergence phase_

!e first stage lasted from 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1993 and aimed at providing the necessary foundation

upon which to build EMU, especially a greater convergence of economic performance and enhancing economic

and monetary coordination amongst member states within the existing EMS institutional framework. !e

409

International Finance

main features of this stage were the completion of the Single Market project, a strengthening of community

policies to iron out regional imbalances, greater cooperation and coordination of monetary and fiscal policies,

the removal of obstacles to financial integration including the removal of all obstacles to the private use of the

ECU, and all members of the EMS joining the ERM.

_Stage 2: the transition phase_

!e second stage began on 1 January 1994 and represented a transition phase aimed at ensuring the readiness

- f national economies for the eventual permanent fixing of exchange rate parities. !is stage required
amendments to the Treaty of Rome and resulted in the Maastricht Treaty. !e basic organs and structure of
economic and monetary union were set up, involving both the revision of existing community institutions
and the establishment of new ones. !e major institutional development in this stage was the establishment

- f the European Monetary Institute (EMI) in Frankfurt on 1 January 1994 to prepare the groundwork for
the implementation of the final phase. !e EMI had two main tasks: (i) to assist progress on economic
convergence by strengthening coordination of monetary policies between EU central banks, the so-called
ESCB, with the aim of ensuring price stability; and (ii) to make preparations for the final phase, for example
by working on issues such as the statute of the Central Bank, the ESCB, note and coin design, financial sector
issues, dissemination of information, and so on.

!e ESCB absorbed the previously existing monetary arrangements (the EMCF and Committee of Central

Bank governors). !e key task of the ESCB was to begin the transition from the coordination of independent

national monetary policies to the formulation and implementation of a common monetary policy by the

ESCB itself. Upon EMU in 1999, the ESCB assumed full control over the formulation and implementation

- f the community's monetary policy, including day-to-day decisions on exchange market interventions with
respect to third currencies.

_Stage 3: the fixing and euro phase_

!e Maastricht Treaty stipulated two possible starting dates for the permanent fixing of exchange rates:

either 1 January 1997 or 1 January 1999; since the 1997 date was missed, 1 January 1999 became _de facto_

the new starting date. Members that met the so-called Maastricht conditions would move to irrevocably

locked exchange rates with national currencies subsequently being replaced by the euro. From 1 January

1999 the members of the currency union became subject to a single monetary policy set by the ECB.

In addition, rules and procedures relating to the community in the macroeconomic and budgetary field

became binding. !e ECB was given full control over the formulation and implementation of the eurozone's

monetary policy.

16.15 THE MAASTRICHT TREATY

As a follow-up to the Delors Report, the Maastricht Treaty was signed in the Dutch town of Maastricht

in December 1991 and, following ratification in the parliaments of all EU countries, came into force on

1)November 1993. !e Maastricht Treaty was in part a collection of additions and amendments to the Treaty of

Rome, covering political and economic reform. It provided the legal basis to establish the institutions required

for EMU; for instance, allowing the formation of an ECB. !e Treaty also set out the conditions under which

a country would be eligible for joining EMU. Only countries that meet all four of the following conditions, the

410

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

so-called 'convergence criteria', had the right to join the EMU at the outset, and these conditions also apply to

prospective new EMU entrants (see section 16.31):

1. Average consumer price in$ation in the country should not be more than 1.5% above that of the three

countries with the lowest in$ation rates;

A country should not have an excessive budget deficit, with the reference rate being that it should not

exceed 3% of GDP;

3. !e outstanding public-sector debt (national debt) of the country should not exceed 60% of GDP;
4. Average nominal long-term interest rates in the year of examination should not be more than 2%

above that of the three countries with the lowest in$ation rates.

It should be noted that in respect of the Maastricht criteria there were two big let-out clauses. Firstly, in respect

- f fiscal deficits a country might be permitted to join with a deficit above 3% of GDP if 'the ratio has declined
substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to the reference value; or, alternatively, the
excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the ratio remains close to the reference
value'. Secondly, in respect of the levels of national debt, a country might be permitted to join the EMU with
national debts above 60% if 'the ratio is su'ciently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a
satisfactory pace'. !e latter let-out clause became very significant when the European Commission made its
assessment of eligible entrants in 1998.

In addition to the four criteria, the currency of a country was expected to have respected normal margins

- f $uctuation and not have been devalued within the ERM in the two years prior to a country joining EMU.
!e United Kingdom and Denmark were in a different position from the other EU countries since they
were)not required to join EMU even if they met the convergence criteria. !e United Kingdom negotiated
an 'opt-out' which was set out in a Protocol attached to the Treaty. !e Protocol stated that the UK was not

- bliged to join Stage 3 without a separate decision by its government and Parliament. Denmark decided not
to join Stage 3 but had the right to revoke this decision in accordance with its constitution. Subsequently, it
was agreed that actual (not forecast!) 1997 data would be used for assessing which countries were eligible to
join EMU in conjunction with forecasts for 1998, the decision being taken by a qualified majority vote in May
1998. Sweden effectively made itself ineligible for EMU entrance by not permitting the krona to participate in
the ERM system for the two years prior to EMU.

16.16 AN EVALUATION OF THE MAASTRICHT CRITERIA

!e Maastricht criteria were primarily motivated by a German desire to ensure that the qualifying members

for EMU had a strong fiscal and monetary background. Having an ECB with voting members made up from

countries with a sound financial background was viewed as an essential foundation for ensuring that the

euro would turn out to be a sound currency with similar attributes to the Deutschmark. Another way of

saying roughly the same thing was that the Germans were keen to exclude countries with a poor economic

record and a high propensity to print money when faced with economic di'culty (such as Italy and Greece).

While the basic idea of including only countries with sound economies and sound fiscal policies as a basis

for ensuring a sound monetary union has significant merits, the Maastricht criteria have been subjected to

numerous criticisms.

One criticism was that the Maastricht criteria were very arbitrary both in relation to the targets set and

the targets chosen. !e choice of 3% for the budget deficit to GDP ratio and 60% for the government debt to

411

International Finance

GDP ratio were clearly arbitrary – the limits could easily be raised to say 3.5% and 80% respectively without

creating a confidence crisis and permitting more founding members. In addition, in the run-up to EMU there

was evidence that some governments were massaging their fiscal deficits to meet the criteria.

Another major criticism was that the national debt criterion was not really appropriate since it looked

- nly on the liability side, ignoring state-owned assets. A government could have a high national debt, but the
value of state-owned assets might mean it has a low net liability or even a positive net asset position; whereas
a government with a lower national debt might have relatively few state-owned assets and a lower net asset
position relative to its GDP. Many have criticized the choice of targets as being only financially oriented,
having nothing to say on the real economy, such as economic growth, the balance of payments and the rate of
unemployment. Indeed, the narrow focus on financial criteria may have imposed an excessive degree of fiscal
austerity on Europe in the run-up to EMU, implying higher unemployment and lower economic growth, than
would otherwise have been the case.

A significant critique of the Maastricht conditions was made by Paul De Grauwe (1996), who pointed out

that countries like Italy and Belgium would have less of a public debt problem and lower fiscal deficits if they

were allowed to join the EMU. !is is because outside of EMU they had to pay high interest rates on their

public debts since financial markets feared that they would resort to printing money to repay their debts,

and as such they had a significant in$ation risk premium built into their interest rates. In a monetary union

they would have a lower in$ation premium to pay since they would not be able to print money to redeem

their national debts which would be denominated in euros. In turn, lower interest rates would enable them to

lower their fiscal deficits since they would reduce the financing cost of the national debt which is part of this

year's fiscal deficit. In other words, high government debt countries could more easily meet the Maastricht

conditions as members of EMU than if they were excluded.

A further argument levelled against the Maastricht conditions is that the convergence criteria were not

really that important and that they distracted attention from more important fundamental issues. !e

Maastricht Treaty itself has a so-called 'no-bailout' clause that makes it clear that government debt is the

responsibility of the government that issues the debt; in legal terms other member states are excluded from

'joint and several liability'. As such, it can be argued that the Maastricht conditions were not really necessary

since each government that joins EMU is responsible for its own debt and governments will have to be prudent

so as to ensure that their debt rating is not undermined by credit-rating agencies.

Another problem with the Maastricht conditions is that there were plenty of 'before' conditions but no

'a(er' conditions, which to some extent was illogical. A country might behave well before joining the monetary

union to qualify for membership and then misbehave a(er joining. A realization of this problem motivated

the Germans to demand that the Maastricht conditions be extended to cover the behaviour of countries a(er

they joined EMU. More specifically, they negotiated a so-called Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) to cover the

post-EMU era.

16.17 THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT

In the run-up to EMU the German government began to realize that selling the EMU project to a sceptical

German public would be extremely di'cult without any post-EMU guarantees on fiscal deficits. In particular,

the Germans feared that countries might get their budget deficits down to meet the Maastricht fiscal criteria,

but a(er EMU fiscal laxity would undermine confidence in the new euro.

At a summit held in Dublin in December 1996, the Germans secured the SGP, designed to ensure that

fiscal prudence remained in place following the start of EMU. !e pact subjects countries running 'excessive'

412

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

fiscal deficits (defined as a deficit above 3% of GDP) to fines unless they take action to get their deficits

down. Each member state of the monetary union had to prepare a multi-annual stability programme setting

- ut its budgetary position, which requires endorsement by the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers
(ECOFIN), and make it public. Implementation of the programme is monitored by the Commission and
ECOFIN which can recommend policy adjustments if the plans are not adhered to.

If a country is deemed to have an excessive deficit the Commission prepares a report and sends it to

ECOFIN; and if the Council believes the deficit to be excessive it will recommend that the member state take

corrective action within four months with a view to correcting the deficit within 12 months of its occurrence.

If the measures are not implemented or are deemed to be insu'cient, the member state must make a noninterest-rate bearing deposit with the ECB ten months a(er the notification. If the deficit remains excessive

the deposit is converted into a fine two years later.

!ere are exceptions in which a deficit may be above 3% of GDP without incurring a fine. Most importantly,

if the member state has suffered a sharp economic downturn, defined as an annual fall of real GDP of 2%, then

the deficit is considered exceptional and does not trigger any action. In general, a fall of less than 0.75% in GDP

is not considered exceptional, while a fall of between 0.75% and 2% in GDP is subject to the judgement of the

Council. Other exceptions, i.e. unusual events outside of the country's control, such as a national catastrophe

which has a major impact on the member state's financial position.

!e penalty initially takes the form of a deposit to be placed in a special Community budget account,

which is convertible into a fine a(er two years if the country fails to bring down its annual budget deficit. !e

maximum penalty in any one year is 0.5% of GDP; in the first year the deposit is a fixed portion of 0.2% of

GDP and a variable portion of 0.1% for every 1% above the 3% threshold. If the deficit persists in the second

year, additional variable portion sanctions can be levied up to a ceiling of 0.5% of GDP.

16.18 THE CHANGEOVER TO THE SINGLE CURRENCY

In November 1995 the EMI published a document entitled '!e Changeover to the Single Currency', setting

- ut the transition process. !e document envisaged three periods for the transition:
!e first period (scheduled for May 1998) involved the selection of the countries that met the

Maastricht criteria and were therefore eligible to join EMU.

A second period (1 January 1999) involved the permanent fixing of the bilateral rates between the

member currencies and announcement of their conversion rates to the euro. At the start of the

second period the EMI was to be liquidated and replaced by the ECB and the ESCB, comprising the

ECB and existing national central banks; the purpose of the ESCB being to conduct a single monetary

policy for the euro area and to maintain price stability by setting appropriate short-term interest

rates for the euro. !e ESCB would be responsible for both money-market and foreign-exchange

    - perations for the euro. !e euro was to be used in banking operations alongside the existing

national currencies, but one of the guiding principles of the second period was 'no compulsion,

no prohibition', that is, no company/bank was to be compelled to use or prevented from using the

euro or existing national currencies. !is meant that banks were free to make transactions and

    - ffer services in the euro but would only be compelled to do so in the final period. In addition, all

contracts denominated in ECUs were to be legally replaced by the euro on the basis of one ECU being

equal to one euro.

International Finance

A final period (starting on 1 January 2002) was the introduction of euro banknotes and coins

alongside existing national notes and coins for a maximum period of six months. Both were to

be legal tender and anyone was able to exchange on demand their national currency for euros at

commercial banks or the national central banks. At the end of the six months and no later than

1)July 2002, it was planned that national notes would cease to be legal tender (although exchangeable
for euros at national central banks) with the euro becoming the sole legal tender in the participating

countries.

By and large, the timetable envisaged in the changeover plan was successfully followed. On 25 March 1998

the European Commission and EMI published their convergence reports recommending that 11 countries)–

Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and

Spain)– be admitted to EMU. !en in May 1998 during a meeting of the Heads of State held in Brussels the

formal decision was taken to admit these countries and the bilateral exchange rate parities were fixed at the

central rates prevailing in the ERM as shown in Table 16.2. It was not possible to announce the rates against

the euro since the pound sterling was $oating against the currencies; and since the pound was part of the ECU

then the currencies were still $uctuating against the ECU. On 1 June 1998 the ECB formally came into being,

replacing the EMI.

On 31 December 1998 the conversion rates to the euro were announced, based on the then prevailing

exchange rates of the currencies against the ECU. Hence the ECU moved from being a mere calculation to

a real currency, called the euro, at a parity of one ECU to one euro. !e final announced conversion rates of

the national currencies to the euro are shown in Table 16.6 and are the permanently irrevocably fixed rates

that prevailed from that point onwards for financial market transactions and for when the national currencies

were to be replaced by actual euro notes and coins as from 1 January 2002.

On 19 June 2000 the Council of Ministers judged that Greece had fulfilled the convergence criteria and

approved its accession to the euro area as the twel(h member, starting on 1 January 2001. New member states

joining the monetary union since then include Slovenia (1 January 2007), Cyprus and Malta (1 January 2008),

Slovakia (1 January 2009), Estonia (1 January 2011), Latvia (1 January 2014) and Lithuania (1 June 2015). Box

**Box 16.2 The practicalities of introducing the euro**

Although EMU commenced in January 1999 with the irrevocable fixing of exchange rate parities, euro

notes and coins were actually introduced at street level on 1 January 2002. Approximately &132 billion

worth of notes and &37.5 billion of coins were brought into circulation. !e distribution of the coins

required the equivalent of 1,000 one-ton trucks making the equivalent of 100,000 journeys. Some

3.2 million vending machines needed converting, requiring at least one man-hour to convert each to

accept new notes and coins. However, the actual introduction of euro notes and coins went surprisingly

smoothly, and within 20 days there was a near 90% usage of the euro in the eurozone area.

16.19 THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EURO IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

When the euro first came into existence it had a parity of approximately \$1.17/&1, and many economists

expected it to strengthen. But contrary to expectations, in the first few years of its existence the euro exhibited

a marked decline against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market, trading as low as \$0.82/&1. However,

as Figure 16.2 shows, once the euro hit the streets in 2002 it made a dramatic recovery, rising to as high as

\$1.58/&1 in the foreign exchange market in June 2008. However, since the financial crisis and in particular

the eurozone crisis, the euro has exhibited more weakness and by earky November 2022 it was trading at

around)\$1/&1.

16.20 THE EUROSYSTEM

!e overall decision-making structure and control of monetary policy in the eurozone is carried out in the

framework of the eurosystem. !e eurosystem comprises the ECB and the 19 national central banks (NCBs);

the governing bodies of the eurosystem are the Executive Board and the Governing Council. !e Executive

Board consists of the president, vice president and four directors of the ECB, while the Governing Council is

made up of the six members of the Executive Board and governors of the 19 NCBs. !e Governing Council

is the main decision-making body and formulates monetary policy for the eurozone area, taking decisions

- n interest rates, reserve requirements and the provision of liquidity to financial markets and institutions.
!e Governing Council meets every two weeks in Frankfurt and each of its 25 members has one vote; the
Executive Board implements decisions taken by the Governing Council including giving instructions to the
19 NCBs. So, while the decision-making process is highly centralized, the implementation process is in fact
quite decentralized with the NCBs carrying out the decisions in their national money markets.

!e independent ECB has been modelled on the Bundesbank. Indeed, De Grauwe (2003) argues that the

language used by the dra(ers of the statutes on the ECB was tougher on in$ation and political independence

than the statutes of the Bundesbank. !e ECB has a statutory duty to ensure ‘price stability’, whose definition

was le( to the ECB to define: ‘the primary objective of the ECB’s monetary policy is to maintain price stability.

!e ECB aims at in$ation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term'. While the objectives of the

ECB are laid out in the Maastricht Treaty, Article 105 in particular makes it clear that the prime objective is

price stability, though it permits the ECB 'without prejudice to the objective of price stability' to take into

account general economic policies within the eurozone area, including levels of employment, though these are

very much secondary to the main objective. From its _Monthly Report_ it is quite clear that the ECB itself regards

its sole objective as being the maintenance of price stability.

!e Maastricht Treaty is very clear on the political independence of the ECB, and Article 107 states that:

When exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by this

Treaty … neither the ECB nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision making bodies

shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any Government of a

Member State or from any other body.

!e independence of the ECB has been secured by several means. Firstly, the Maastricht Treaty conditions,

which can themselves only be modified by unanimous approval of all EU member states. Secondly, the minutes

- f its Governing Council meeting – when it sets the target level of short-term interest rates for the euro – are
not published, nor is the voting record of its members – this protects national central bank governors from
fear of job losses for not voting the way that their national governments would like. Finally, the ECB is also
prohibited from printing money to finance any member state's fiscal deficit. !ere have been criticisms about
the potential lack of accountability of the ECB, but it has made some moves to dispel such criticisms. For
instance, the President of the Bank holds a press conference a(er every meeting of the Governing Council to
explain its interest rate policy; the ECB also publishes its _Monthly Report_ which explains in some detail the
basis of its policies.

While the ECB has a target rate of in$ation of close to 2%, it has made it clear that this is a medium-term

target (the precise time period is not defined) and as such it can permit this target to be exceeded in the short

run. Indeed, in the first 285 months of the euro the 2% in$ation target was exceeded in 116 of the months

(that is, 40.7% of the time); however, the deviations were not generally substantial except for a period during

416

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

September 2007 to October 2008 when it was above 3% with a peak of 4.0% in June and July 2008, following

the Russian invasion of Ukraine it peaked at 10.7% in October 2022. In fact, during the period January 1999 to

October 2022 covering 285 months, the monthly average annualized rate of in$ation was 1.84%. !e behaviour

- f the in$ation rate in the eurozone is depicted in Figure 16.3. !e ECB uses an intermediate monetary targeting
system to achieve its in$ation target, and in particular it has set a reference value for the rate of growth of the
M3 money supply in the eurozone of 4.5% per annum, though it permits the reference value to be exceeded or
undershot so long as the in$ation target is likely to be met over the medium term. !e main policy decision of
the Governing Council is to set the _refinancing rate_ which is the rate of interest at which it will provide liquidity
to the banking system in exchange for eligible reserves such as euro-denominated Treasury bills.

Authors such as De Grauwe (2003) have made a number of criticisms of the in$ation target; in particular, it

is regarded as too low since the actual reported in$ation rate may overstate the real in$ation rate by anywhere

from 0.5–1.5% because of quality improvements. Also, since it is an in$ation target for the eurozone area as a

whole there may be widely divergent in$ation rates between members of the eurozone, with in$ation below

2% in some, such as Germany, but slightly higher than 2% in others, as can be seen in Figure 16.4, where

countries like Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain have seen their consumer price indices rise significantly

relative to Germany since the commencement of EMU. !is implies a major loss of competitiveness in these

economies relative to Germany, especially in the case of Greece.

**Figure 16.4** Changes in the consumer price indices in the PIIGS and Germany since EMU

!is loss of competitiveness is also re$ected in the deterioration of their current account deficits as a percentage

- f GDP, while Germany's current account improved significantly due to its increasing competitiveness as
depicted in Table 16.7, only starting in 2013 did the current accounts of the PIIGS start to improve.

16.21 THE FAILURE OF THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT

!e SGP was supposed to act as a constraint on fiscal deficits post-EMU; however, as shown in Table 16.8,

German and French fiscal deficits exceeded the SGP requirements in 2003 and 2004, meaning that initial

deposit fines should have been levied on both. However, the two countries successfully blocked such attempts,

and this to a large extent undermined the credibility of the SGP. Fines can be imposed only when a two-thirds

majority of the Council of Ministers (finance ministers) approve their imposition, and France and Germany

blocked attempts by smaller countries and the Commission to impose the fines. !e failure to enforce the SGP

- n the big countries, and a feeling that the SGP imposes an unduly harsh fiscal straitjacket upon countries that
need to stimulate economic growth by running larger than 3% fiscal deficits for a certain period of time, led
to an intense debate on how to reform the SGP.

One suggestion was to pay attention to the size of public debt. If a country has a low level of national debt

then it could be permitted to exceed the 3% fiscal deficit criterion for a period of time, whereas a country

with a high national debt would be expected to keep to the 3% limit. As Table 16.9 shows, there are very large

variations in countries' debt levels, which have all worsened considerably since the onset of the 2007 financial

crisis, the PIIGS crisis and the covid-19 pandemic. Another suggestion is to pay more attention to the cyclically

adjusted fiscal deficit; in the case where an economy is growing below trend, its headline deficit may be above

3% but its cyclically adjusted deficit might be below 3%, whereas when the economy is growing above trend,

its headline figure may be below 3% while its cyclically adjusted figure might be above 3%. Other proposals

include raising the fiscal deficit above 3% to, say, 4%, or permitting it to average 3% over the economic cycle,

thereby allowing a country temporarily to exceed 3% without necessarily incurring a fine. !e credit crunch

and eurozone crisis eventually led to the so-called Fiscal Compact which is covered in section 16.28.

16.22 THE ERM II

When the ERM I ceased to exist on 1 January 1999, ERM II came into being principally so that Greece that

had not qualified for EMU and Denmark that had decided not to join could continue to maintain stable

currencies against the euro members. !e ERM II is also relevant to the accession countries that joined the

EU in May 2004, as joining ERM II for two years is an essential precondition for participation in EMU itself.

Despite having the same $uctuation bands as ERM I of ±15%, ERM II is not a carbon copy. ERM II has four

key features: (1) it is based on central rates fixed for participating currencies vis-à-vis the euro and therefore

has no parity grid – the normal band of $uctuation being ±15%; (2) there exist obligatory interventions once

margins are met; (3) the ECB and all participating 'pre-in' central banks have the right to initiate procedures to

review the central rates; and (4) access is provided to short-term financing facilities with the ECB having the

right to suspend intervention and financing operations. In practice, a country that joins ERM II can request

a lower margin of $uctuation, and such has been the case with Denmark that currently operates a ±2.25%

band against the euro. Any accession countries are expected to spend a _minimum_ - f two years in ERM II prior

to their adoption of the euro. As at November 2022, the EMU has 19 member countries and there are three

members of ERM II as depicted in Table 16.10.

16.23 PIIGS AND THE EUROZONE CRISIS

Once the monetary union commenced in 1999, it was essential that to maintain their competitiveness visà-vis Germany, countries like Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain (PIIGS) would need to keep their

in$ation rates in line with Germany. However, this was not the case, as shown in Figure 16.4. !is loss of

competitiveness over time, with the consequent problems for the export sector, meant that the PIIGS

economies were more vulnerable than countries like Germany when the global financial crisis started in 2007.

While UIP implies that very short-term interest rates such as three-month Treasury bill rates will be equal

in a monetary union (since the expected change in the exchange rate is equal to zero, as the countries have the

same currency, and assuming the probability of default on three-month Treasury bills is zero), this is not the

case for long-term bond yields within a monetary union. When countries are locked together in a monetary

union, the member countries cannot unilaterally print money to redeem their debt. As such, investors in

debt of the various countries of the monetary union have to factor in the possibility that a country that has

issued bonds may default on its obligations. For example, one country may have a AAA credit rating and

can therefore borrow for ten years at, say, 4% while another country may have only a BBB rating indicating a

higher probability of default and so may have to pay 5.5% on a ten-year debt that it issues. In a sense, countries

in the monetary union become like companies within a country: those with the best credit rating and lowest

probability of default will be funded at a lower yield than those companies with lower credit ratings and a

higher probability of default. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Christopher Sims has succinctly put it

at an IMF conference:

!ere is a very important distinction between in$ation risk and default risk. !ere is a kind of a default

premium. An entity that issues debt that only promises to pay paper that it can print for free, is free

  - f any risk that the entity will be unable to deliver on the contract terms. It's one thing for markets to
worry about unpredictable in$ation reducing the value of a bond. Another thing is for the markets to
be uncertain whether at the next rollover this issue of debt is going to not be fully paid or whether there
might be a general haircut on debt.

!e risks to holders of debt of an unspecified form of default is much more disruptive than the

risk of losing some of the value of the debt through unpredictable in$ation. And I think that's why

even though on fundamentals the UK and the US and Japan look like they're in as much trouble as

European countries, nonetheless those countries can print what they promised to pay. So there's no

short-term risk of a sudden, unpredictable allocation of losses across different bondholders. (Reuters,

23 April 2012)

Prior to the outbreak of the credit crunch in August 2007 the premium on PIIGS debt over German

ten-year bonds was relatively modest, as depicted in Figure 16.5, but once the credit crunch got under

way their loss of competitiveness since joining EMU relative to Germany, and the relatively high levels of

government debt, combined with a very significant widening of their fiscal deficits, made the participants

in the financial markets worry about the sustainability of their government fiscal positions. As such, there

were speculative)attacks launched first upon Greek bonds and then on Irish and Portuguese bonds. As shown

in Figure 16.5, the bond yields of the PIIGS over Germany widened considerably, especially in the cases

- f Greece, Ireland and Portugal, starting around January 2009. To some extent the speculative attacks on
these three countries became self-fulfilling in the sense that as interest rates on their debts rose, given their
debt profiles, the probability of default increased markedly, especially given their relatively low prospective
economic growth)rates.

16.24 THE BAILOUTS OF GREECE, IRELAND, PORTUGAL AND SPAIN

Although the Maastricht Treaty explicitly ruled out the use of bailouts through the so-called 'no bailout clause',

which states that members are not jointly or severally liable for the debts of the other member states, a bailout

- f Greece, rather than allowing it to default on its obligations, came to be seen as a necessity. !e main reason
for this was that it soon became apparent that French and German banks held over 70% of the Greek debt.

!ey had held large holdings of Greek debt as part of their capital requirements because it had been giving

a slightly higher yield than German bonds. As such, a default by the Greeks would have severely impacted

- n the viability of the French and German banking systems. In addition, there was a fear of the spread of
contagion: if Greece were to default it would then perhaps lead to speculative attacks on other vulnerable
countries such as Ireland and Portugal with the real fear being that it could eventually engulf a large country
such as Spain and Italy who were deemed to be 'too big to rescue'. If Greece defaulted, the feeling was that
speculative attacks against the debts of the other PIIGS could raise their yields to such high levels that they
too would be forced into defaults.

!e background to the build-up of Greek debt goes back quite some time. It should be remembered that

Greece was allowed to join the EMU in January 2001 despite then having a national debt to GDP ratio of 104.7%

rather than the 60% ratio that would have been in strict compliance with the Maastricht Treaty conditions. In

the run-up to Greece joining the eurozone, Greek ten-year bond yields fell significantly from 19% in January

1999 to only 5.3% in January 2001 when the country o'cially joined. !e Greek governments used these very

low yields to borrow even more, especially to help finance the Olympic games held in Athens in 2004. Another

persistent problem in Greece was over-employment in the public sector combined with a poor system of tax

collection and a culture of significant tax evasion by its citizens that meant a structural borrowing problem

had built up over time. A further problem was that Greece appears to have been deliberately underreporting

the state of its public finances.

!e problem of the build-up of debt was fully exposed once the credit crunch got under way. !e rapid

rise in unemployment meant reduced tax collection and greater fiscal outlays. !is, combined with a large

cumulative fall in 2008–12 of GDP of around 20%, meant the fiscal deficit rose from 6% in 2006 to 15.6%

in 2009 along with a projected fiscal deficit of 7.4% for 2012. !e national debt as a proportion of GDP also

rose rapidly due to a combination of the high fiscal deficits (which add to the national debt) and the falls in

GDP.)Both the shipping and tourism industries in Greece were particularly badly affected by the slowdown

in global trade.

!e first Greek rescue package was arranged on 2 May 2010 with a bailout of &110 billion: the 16 eurozone

countries contributed &80 billion and the IMF &30 billion, the loans being made at an average yield of around

5.2%. !e bailout was made conditional upon Greece taking significant austerity measures designed to get its

fiscal deficits down, including a rise in VAT from 21 to 23%, a 10% rise in fuel, alcohol and tobacco duties and

larger cuts in public salaries and pensions of over 20%. On 7 May 2010 the Greek government passed a package

implementing a &30 billion reduction in its fiscal deficit over the following three years. In a bid to reduce the

risk of contagion from Greece to other economies the EU/IMF agreed to set up a European Financial Stability

Facility (EFSF) with an initial effective endowment of &250 billion (raised in July 2011 to &440 billion), the

idea being that the EFSF could issue bonds, which would be guaranteed by the eurozone countries, and use

these funds to lend to the PIIGS if necessary. !e idea of the EFSF was to provide immediate liquidity for

Greece, Ireland and Portugal that would help forestall further speculative attacks. In July 2011 the EFSF was

given permission to use some of its capital buy bonds on the secondary market in a bid to contain bond yields.

!e initial bailout of Greece did little to restore confidence in the financial markets as it became increasingly

clear that the Greek national debt level projected to reach 160% of GDP was unsustainable, especially as bond

yields on the debt were skyrocketing (ten-year yields were approaching 32% by the end of November 2011).

As such, it became apparent that the Greek debt level would need to be both reduced and restructured, the

hope being that resolving the Greek situation would prevent contagion to other markets such as Portugal and

more importantly Spain and Italy. Once it became clear that the Greek debt level would need to be reduced

and restructured, the key questions became:

424

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

 Who would suffer losses from the restructuring and how much losses would they be obliged to accept?

 Would the Greek deal be classified as an orderly 'voluntary' restructuring deal or a disorderly default?

 - What economic reforms and policies would Greece have to adopt to ensure that it would be able
to repay the remaining debt and keep its restructured public finances on a longer-term fiscal
sustainability?

A second Greek rescue package was arranged in March 2012 with the eurozone countries and IMF

agreeing to lend a further &130 billion. In the second bailout, under German pressure the creditor banks

were forced to accept substantial losses of &109 billion on their holdings of Greek debt in order to reduce the

Greek debt levels. !e second bailout package offered creditors a wide menu of options including a 'voluntary'

programme to convert existing bonds into 30-year bonds. Also, the interest rate bill expected of Greece from

the previous bailout was reduced by 0.5% for the first five years and 1.5% therea(er (similar reductions were

also allowed for Ireland and Portugal). In the second Greek bailout, most private-sector debt holders took

losses of some 77% of the net present value of their bond holdings.

!e Irish bailout was necessitated by the dramatic impact of the credit crunch and the ending of its housing

bubble which led to the virtual collapse of its banking system. During the period January 2000 to the end of

2006 Irish house prices rose a staggering 116.7%, having already more than doubled between 1995 and 2000.

Irish banks had in the background built up a huge loan exposure to the Irish property market. Once house

prices started to fall and non-performing loans started to rise, the viability of the Irish banking sector was

called into question. !e Irish government was forced to step in and nationalize all but one of the six major

banks and guarantee their deposits. !e massive bailout of these banks substantially raised the national debt

- f Ireland and resulted in a massive increase in its fiscal deficit for fiscal year 2010 to a staggering 31.2% of
GDP. !e fall in the Irish GDP meant that the ability of the Irish government to pay back its debt was called
into question and the yield on its bonds rose dramatically.

On 21 November 2010 the Irish government yielded to the inevitable and agreed to a bailout package

- f &85 billion. !is new money was made available on condition of the country enacting a severe austerity
programme made up of &15 billion of cuts over four years, including &6 billion in budget cuts, and tax rises for
2011, including savage wage and pension cuts combined with a reduction in the minimum wage. !e target

- f the austerity programme was to reduce the Irish fiscal deficit down from 31.2% to less than 3% of GDP for
fiscal year 2014.

Following the Irish bailout Portugal became the next target for speculators to attack. Portugal was

vulnerable because of its national debt exceeding 85% of GDP and its high fiscal deficit which was projected

at over 9% for 2011. On 4 May 2011, Portugal received a &78 billion bailout at an average interest rate of 5.1%

- n the condition that it reduce its budget deficit from 9.1% of GDP to 5.9% immediately for the fiscal year
2011 and reduce it to 3% by 2013. !e bailout terms included: rises in sales, property and health service taxes;
the duration of unemployment benefits being cut to 18 months from three years; and cuts to state pensions
that are over &1,500 (\$2,217) a month. !ere was also agreement to privatize TAP Air Portugal, the airport
management company ANA, the national mail company CTT, and government stakes in energy company
EdP and national electricity distribution company REN. In addition, major public works projects, such as a
high-speed rail link to Spain, were postponed.

On 5 August 2011 Italian and Spanish bond yields reached new peaks of over 6%, calling into question

the viability of their sovereign debt. Following an announcement by Standard and Poor's on 5 August 2011

that the United States sovereign debt would be downgraded from AAA to AA+ there was real fear that when

the markets reopened on 8 August there would be carnage in the bond and stock markets. To forestall the

425

International Finance

speculative attacks the ECB Governing Council met over the weekend and, under the aegis of its Securities

Market Programme, agreed to buy Spanish and Italian bonds. !e immediate impact was a fall in the ten-year

bond yields from 6.09 to 5.44% on Italian bonds and from 6.04 to 5.32% in the case of Spain, with rises in their

stock markets of 3.2 and 4.1% respectively.

During April to June 2012 attention in the financial markets increasingly started to focus on Spain.

Spanish banks had extended enormous amounts of loans to the Spanish property sector since the turn of

the century, resulting in a construction boom and housing bubble. When this burst, Spanish banks had a

large amount of dubious loans on their books. !e probability that a Spanish government bailout of Spanish

banks might be needed meant that Spanish government bond yields started to rise, reaching 6.53% by the

end of May.

Spanish banks had found themselves involved in a credit and property boom from the turn of the century,

during which they lent huge sums of money to finance residential and commercial property. As is usual

in a housing bubble, prices went up and there was a belief that they would continue upwards; there was

- verbuilding. When prices reached unaffordable levels they started to decline and many property projects
were abandoned before completion. !is meant that non-performing loans in the banks and _cajas_ (saving
institutions) started to rise dramatically. !e initial reaction was to conduct stress tests in July 2010 and,
although five out of 27 banks were deemed to have insu'cient capital, the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors report nonetheless concluded that 'the exercise confirms that the Spanish banking system is
sound, and in turn substantiates the savings bank restructuring and recapitalisation process pursued over
the past twelve months by the Bank of Spain'. In fact, the tests were wholly unfit for purpose. A second round

- f stress tests in July 2011 found five banks failing to pass the tests, yet the Spanish banking system was still
deemed to be in a good state. Another response was to merge seven weak _cajas_ into a new bank named
Bankia that was sold off via an Initial Public Offering process to the Spanish public on 18 July 2011. Within a
year reality began to hit home. On 28 May 2012 Bankia collapsed, and on 7 June Spain's sovereign rating was
downgraded three notches to BBB.

As fears for the Spanish banking system increased and the yields on Spanish government debt rose,

Spain agreed on 9 June 2012 to accept funding from the EFSF and its successor the European Stability

Mechanism (see later) of up to &100 billion of loans to recapitalize its banking system. While the funding

was to be administered by the Spanish Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring it was ultimately guaranteed for

repayment by the Spanish government. !e hope was that the funding would help to stabilize the Spanish

banking system.

16.25 THE COVERED BOND PURCHASE PROGRAMME

Many European banks were suffering as a result of the credit crunch that had started in 2007 and were finding

it di'cult to restore their capital ratios as the credit markets had generally dried up for bank funding. To help

improve banks' access to funding the ECB governing council announced in May 2009 that it would permit

the ECB to purchase up to &60 billion of covered bonds (debt backed by pools of assets) on both the primary

and secondary markets. !e initial Covered Bond Purchase Programme (CBPP) was completed by June 2010.

!en, due to further problems as the effects of the eurozone crisis took hold, a second CBPP programme

was announced (CBPP2), authorizing the ECB to purchase another &40 billion of banks' bonds by the end of

October 2012. !e prime aims of the programme were to ensure medium-term funds for struggling European

banks and to improve liquidity in the bank bond market.

426

  - f credit protection (previous purchasers continue to pay &500,000 per annum). As such, rises in CDS
spreads can be taken as a sign that protection sellers are increasingly concerned about the risk of a
credit event. As can be seen in Figure 16.6, the sovereign CDS spreads on the PIIGS debt increased
significantly as the eurozone crisis rolled on.

One interesting point concerning CDSs on sovereign bonds is that you do not have to own the

sovereign debt to buy the protection against a credit event. So, if a hedge fund manager feels that a

sovereign will default a(er one year, then he or she can purchase a CDS for, say, a premium of &500,000

per annum. If the country defaults a(er, say, one year, as predicted, then the manager can simply buy the

defaulted bonds with a face value of &10 million for, say, &3.5 million and deliver them to the protection

seller, so making a net profit of &6,000,000.

16.26 THE SECURITIES MARKET PROGRAMME

On 14 May 2010 the ECB announced the establishment of its Securities Market Programme (SMP), justified

by article 18.1 of the statute setting up the ESCB, which allows the latter to 'operate in the financial markets

by, among other things, buying and selling outright marketable instruments'. !e prime motivation of the

SMP was to contain the ever-rising bond yields on the Portuguese, Irish and Greek debt; in August 2011 it

was expanded to include both Spanish and Italian debt. !e SMP involved ECB purchases of PIIGS sovereign

bonds, both on the primary market and secondary market. !e policy was largely justified by the need to

prevent the risk of their Spanish and Italian debt yields rising to dangerously high levels, which would require

some sort of bailout to be arranged, and to prevent the risk that this would present to the euro itself. Under

the SMP, purchases of PIIGS debt were sterilized by offsetting sales of Treasury bills to sterilize the impact of

the purchases on the European money supply. Some &22 billion of securities were purchased under the SMP

between May 2010 and March 2012.

Despite the pros of the SMP in providing liquidity for the PIIGS bonds and in helping to contain yields,

there were also considerable concerns about the programme. In particular, the buying of such large amounts

- f PIIGS debt meant the ECB was assuming the risk in the event that the PIIGS were to default. In addition,
in the second Greek debt restructuring, the ECB was seen as a senior creditor and its bond holdings were
not subjected to any writedown. A(er this became apparent, the private-sector debt holders started to worry
about further ECB debt purchases of PIIGS debt, since that would mean that their debt holdings would be
increasingly at risk in the event of any future restructuring. !e SMP programme was replaced on 6 September
2012 with the outright monetary transactions programme (see section 16.30).

16.27 THE LONG TERM REFINANCING OPERATION (LTRO)

Between August 2011 and December 2011 there was increased speculation concerning the possibility of Greece

and perhaps other countries being forced out of the eurozone (in the case of Greece this was termed a 'Grexit'). It

also became apparent that the ECB policy of keeping a lid on Spanish and Italian bond yields by purchasing their

government bonds – the SMP – was increasingly being called into question by German o'cials, two of whom

resigned from their positions in the ECB in protest. Following the ending of his term of o'ce, Jean-Claude Trichet

was replaced by the Italian Mario Draghi in November 2011. !ere followed a significant change of policy with

interest rates cut from 1.5 to 1%. More significantly, in December 2011 the ECB announced it would lend some

428

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

&489 billion of funds for three years to European banks at an interest rate of 1%. !is was followed by a second

round of funding in February 2012, when 800 banks borrowed a further &529.5 billion. !is policy was dubbed the

Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) and the combined lending under the facility totalled over &1 trillion.

!e LTRO ensured that at least for the next few years no European bank would go under due to liquidity

issues, since they could simply meet these needs by borrowing from the ECB. !is was particularly important

for Greek and Spanish banks that took full advantage of this. !e funds were then invested in government

bonds, so having the effect of reducing Italian and Spanish bond yields. Some of the funds were also used to

buy back existing bank debt, taking advantage of the lower cost of the LTRO funds. !e liquidity effects and

confidence generated by the programme also boosted stock markets that had a strong first quarter to 2012.

However, further doubts about Greece's chances of remaining in the euro following the election in April

meant that most of these gains were wiped out during May 2012.

Although the LTRO addressed the immediate liquidity needs of banks it was not universally welcomed,

being depicted as: further monetary easing; subsidizing the banking sector; allowing insolvent banks that

needed nationalization and/or recapitalization to continue to trade; and perhaps delaying governments from

undertaking the necessary fiscal reforms by indirectly and artificially boosting the demand for their bonds.

It also exposed the European taxpayer to significant risk of losses as the ECB was effectively increasing its

exposure to the European banking sector. Over the period of the credit crisis and eurozone crisis the balance

sheet of the ECB expanded massively from \$1.138 trillion in January 2007 to \$2.980 trillion in May 2012, as

shown in Figure 16.7, due to its liquidity intervention and asset purchases. !e Covid-19 pandemic eventually

led to the ECB's balance sheet expanding to close to \$9 trillion.

16.28 THE FISCAL COMPACT

Following the Greek bailout, it was evident that the SGP had proved inadequate as a means of containing fiscal

deficits and national debt build-ups. As such, from mid-2010 the Germans pressed for a new treaty to address

the fiscal $aws in the EMU project. On 2 March 2012 a Treaty on the Stability, Coordination and Governance

in the Economic and Monetary Union was signed by all members of the EU except the Czech Republic and

the United Kingdom. It is better known as the Fiscal Stability Treaty or Fiscal Compact. !e Fiscal Compact

took effect from 1 January 2013 and required its signatories to introduce legislation to have balanced budgets

- r fiscal surpluses within one year or the European Court of Justice will be able to levy a fine of 0.1% of GDP.
Only countries that had the Fiscal Compact as part of their legal code by March 2013 were eligible to apply for
bailout money from the ESM. !e main provisions of the Fiscal Compact are:
Fiscal budgets should be in surplus or balanced and the structural budget deficit must not exceed

0.5% of nominal GDP. However, countries with national debts below 60% and long-term sustainable
public finances can run structural fiscal deficits of up to 1% of GDP.

2. Member states with national debts above 60% of GDP will reduce these debts towards the reference

value at an average rate of one twentieth per annum.

!e European Court of Justice will be able to fine a country that does not adopt a standardized

balanced budget rule in its constitution, the equivalent of up to 0.1% of GDP. !e fine goes either to

the ESM (if a euro country is fined) or to the general EU budget (if a non-euro country is fined).

4. Member states agree to take the necessary actions and measures, 'which are essential to the good

functioning of the euro area in pursuit of the objectives of fostering competitiveness, promoting

employment, contributing further to the sustainability of public finances and reinforcing financial

stability'. !ey also agree to ensure that all major economic policy reforms that they plan to undertake

will be discussed _ex ante_ and, where appropriate, coordinated among themselves and with the

institutions of the EU.

!e Fiscal Compact was clearly much tougher than the SGP and the inclusion of the national debt criterion

to some extent remedied a crucial defect of the SGP which failed to recognize that countries with low national

debts are generally speaking in more fiscally sustainable positions than countries with high national debts.

Of course, there are concerns that the Pact requires too much fiscal austerity over time constraining potential

economic growth.

16.29 THE EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM

!e hastily arranged bailout funds EFSF and ESM lacked any basis in European law and on 16 December

2010 an amendment to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union was added, which declares

that 'the member states whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if

indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. !e granting of any required financial

assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality'. On 2 February 2011 a formal

Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism was signed, which entered into force in July 2012.

!e ESM is an intergovernmental organization headquartered in Luxembourg. !e fund, totalling around

&500 billion, was made up of contributions from the then 17 eurozone countries, based on their 2010 GDPs

and replaced both the EFSF and EFSM. !e ESM was expected to work in conjunction with the IMF in any

bailouts of eurozone member states with strict conditions applied to any loans. !e hope was that the ESM,

430

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

by having a pool of money to bail out countries, would make speculators wary of launching a speculative

attack. A eurozone country facing a short-term liquidity problem can apply for emergency funding from

the ESM provided it accepts the fiscal austerity programme and related conditions set out. Nonetheless, if a

member state's debt position was regarded as unsustainable, it would be expected to enter negotiations with

its creditors to restructure its debt as a condition for any bailout funds.

16.30 'WHATEVER IT TAKES' AND OUTRIGHT MONETARY TRANSACTIONS

A real turning point in the eurozone crisis came on 27 June 2012 when the Head of the ECB Mario Draghi in

a speech in London made the following statement:

We think the euro is irreversible. And it's not an empty word now, because I preceded saying exactly

what actions have been made, are being made to make it irreversible. But there is another message

I)want to tell you. Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.

And believe me, it will be enough.

!e irreversible references and the 'whatever it takes' phrase had a remarkable impact on financial markets

as it clearly demonstrated that the ECB would take all necessary measures to keep the eurozone intact and

signalled a preparedness of the ECB to use its resources and powers to take on any speculators betting on a

breakup of the eurozone. !e impact on financial markets was immediate with interest rates on bonds issued

by the PIIGS falling. While the initial impact on yields was to lower them, during late August interest rates

in the PIIGS debt were beginning to rise again and on 6 September 2012 the ECB, worried about the rising

bond yields in Spain and Italy, announced that it was engaging in a new policy called Outright Monetary

Transactions (OMTs) which would allow it to buy government debt in the secondary markets in unlimited

amounts if necessary. !e idea was that this would help to lower bond yields in countries such as Spain and

Italy. However, such purchases would be conditional on countries adopting strict conditionality with regard

to fiscal policy under the ESM and IMF programmes. Any OMT purchases would be sterilized in that for

every &1 billion of government debt purchased the ECB would sell &1 billion of securities, so that there would

be no monetary base implications from the programme. !is means it is not part of the quantitative easing

programme which does affect the monetary base. Interestingly any bonds purchased by the ECB under the

programme would be treated on an equal basis ( _pari passu_ ) as other bond holders. !e initial market reaction

was very favourable with Italian and Spanish bond yields falling over 50 basis points within the first few days

- f the announcement and a study by Altavilla et al. (2014) argued that the OMT programme, although never
actually used, through its announcement effect and extra confidence that it engendered, decreased Italian
and Spanish two-year government bond yields by approximately 2% while leaving German and French twoyear bond yields unchanged. !e legality of the OMT programme was challenged by the German Federal
Constitutional Court as being contrary to German and EU law; however, the European Court of Justice in
June 2015 ruled that the OMT programme was legal since it 'does not exceed the powers of the ECB in relation
to monetary policy and does not contravene the prohibition of monetary financing of EU nations'.

16.31 PROPOSALS TO RESOLVE THE EUROPEAN DEBT CRISIS

!ere have been various proposals put forward to resolve the European debt crisis, motivated by the desire to

avoid the risk of contagion that would result from a formal default by one or more of the PIIGS, the real fear

being that a default by one of the smaller PIIGS could ultimately result in major speculative attacks against

431

International Finance

Spain and Italy, which are too large to rescue and whose default would in turn result in financial turmoil by

undermining the European banks that have large holdings of sovereign debt on their balance sheets.

_Structural reform_

An obvious proposal is for the countries that are heavily in debt to undertake real structural economic reform

to improve the competitiveness of their economies so that they can grow out of their debt problems. Measures

such as privatization, reduction of their bloated public sectors, reductions in state benefits and entitlements,

labour market reform (for example, a reduction in minimum wages and trade union powers) and other

so-called supply side measures could help to improve longer-term economic growth and with it the fiscal

dynamics of the countries. However, such policies are easier said than done and usually meet with strong

public resistance requiring significant economic sacrifice in the short run, even though they may improve

things in the longer run.

_Debt forgiveness/restructuring_

Another proposal is simply to make the bond holders take a 'haircut' on the sovereign debt they have bought

so as to make the debt repayments for countries like Portugal, Ireland and Greece more sustainable. !e idea

is that lower debt service repayments would mean the countries would be able to grow more rapidly as money

can be diverted from debt service repayments to other purposes such as improving infrastructure, education

and health services. Of course, it is the option least preferred by most creditors as it would mean losses on

their loans being realized and in the case of banks this implies falls in their share prices, the need to raise new

capital and in some cases questions their viability.

_The issuance of common E-bonds (Eurobonds)_

In an article published in the _Financial Times_ - n 5 December 2010 Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister

- f Luxembourg, and Giulio Tremonti, the treasury minister of Italy, proposed the setting up of a European
Debt Agency as a successor to the EFSF that would issue E-bonds backed by all the governments of the
eurozone, with each country permitted to issue these bonds to the value of 40% of its GDP. !e idea is that
countries could switch some of their existing debt for newly issued Eurobonds at a lower cost of finance, since
the Eurobond debt would be guaranteed for repayment by countries with a stronger fiscal position such as
Germany. In addition, private holders of already issued public debt could switch some of it for Eurobonds at
a discount to the face value of the debt.

!ere are many merits to the Eurobond proposal; in particular it would create a very liquid market for the

bonds and more transparency in banks' balance sheets as those that chose to swap existing debt in the PIIGS at a

discount to its face value would have safer capital on their balance sheets and their actual losses would be clearer.

More importantly, for the PIIGS, they would be able to reduce their debt service payments as the Eurobonds

would presumably have significantly lower rates of interest. !e main disadvantage is that countries like

Germany may find the interest rate at which they borrow would actually rise as their potential exposure to the

PIIGS debt was factored in by the financial markets. !e proposal is also at odds with the Maastricht no-bailout

clause in that in part members would be jointly and severally liable for the debts of other members and as such

would require a revision to the Treaty. Also, it is highly likely that Eurobond issuance would require European

level tax-raising powers so that repayment of the bonds could be guaranteed. In other words, Eurobonds would

need to be accompanied by a fundamental shi( in fiscal powers, including tax raising at the European level.

432

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

Since the original Eurobond proposal was launched there have been various other proposals to issue common

Eurobonds issued by an EMU Fund (or a European Debt Agency bond issuing authority), but with countries

paying back different rates of interest on access to funds raised via the bonds. Boonstra (2010), for example,

proposes that countries pay a premium rate of interest over countries like France and Germany, depending on the

size of their fiscal and national deficits relative to the averages of low deficit and national debt countries like France

and Germany. Another proposal by Delpla and von Weizsäcker (2010) is that common Eurobonds be issued to

cover, say, the first 60% of a country's national debt with the remainder to be covered via a separate bond of the

national member states. !e common Eurobond would attract a much higher credit rating and therefore a lower

interest rate, while any other debt would be issued by the national government with, in the case of the weaker

member states, a higher rate of interest, re$ecting their poorer credit ratings and the more junior status of these

bonds. Overall, the result should be lower servicing costs of national debt while creating incentives for countries

to get their fiscal deficits and national debts down. Also, the higher liquidity of Eurobonds would be attractive,

as it would lower the liquidity premium required, compared to the current issuance of separate national bonds.

_Allow the ECB to print euros to guarantee debt repayment_

Another proposal is to change the statute of the ECB to enable it essentially to print money to redeem the

debt of the PIIGS if necessary, rather than allow an actual default and the risk of contagion that would follow.

!e argument is that the eurozone member countries have no real alternative other than to default when

their national debts become 'unsustainable', resulting in financial market participants being tempted to make

speculative attacks that can be self-fulfilling. If the ECB was authorized to purchase bonds as they matured then

this would reassure sovereign bond holders in the eurozone that they would likely get their promised coupons

and principal back. Of course, this would mean that there is a risk that the ECB would be seen as monetizing

sovereign debt which, if so, might lead to higher interest rates on sovereign bonds in traditionally low in$ation

countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. To avoid the perceived risk of monetization of debt

there would need to be some constraints on the size of fiscal deficits and issuance of debt to prevent countries

issuing huge amounts of debt, knowing that the debt could ultimately be monetized by the ECB.

16.32 FIRST EMU REFORM PLAN (2012–15)

In December 2012 a report entitled _Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union_ envisaged strengthening

the EMU in three stages:

**Stage 1: Ensuring fiscal sustainability and breaking the costly link between banks and sovereigns**
**(2012–13).** !is involved improving _ex ante_ cooperation via the Fiscal Compact, establishing a single
supervisory mechanism as a precursor to a banking union, capital requirements and directive and regulation
and harmonization of national deposit guarantees as well as a new framework for the European Stability
Mechanism to conduct direct bank recapitalization.

**Stage 2: Completing the integrated financial framework and promoting sound structural policies**
**(2013–14).** !is involved completing the banking union, by establishing the Single Resolution Mechanism
(SRM) as a common resolution authority and setting up the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) as an appropriate
financial backstop. !ere was also established a new 'mechanism for stronger coordination, convergence and
enforcement of structural policies based on arrangements of a contractual nature between Member States and
EU institutions on the policies countries commit to undertake and on their implementation'.

433

International Finance

**Stage 3: (2015 onwards) Improving the resilience of the EMU through the creation of a shock-absorption**
**function at the central level.** !e key aim here was to establish a well-defined and limited fiscal capacity to
improve the absorption of country-specific economic shocks through an insurance system set up at the central
level. !is fiscal capacity aimed to increase the resilience of the eurozone. !e idea was to establish it as a
built-in incentives-based system, so that eurozone Member States eligible for participation in this centralized
asymmetrically working economic shock-absorption function are encouraged to continue implementing
sound fiscal policy and structural reforms, to establish an increasing degree of common decision-making on
national budgets and an enhanced coordination of economic policies.

16.33 SECOND EMU REFORM PLAN (2015–25)

In June 2015 a report entitled _Completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union_ was published and it

- utlined a process to further deepen the EMU; the document is also known as the Five Presidents Report. Its
key objective was to ensure a smoother functioning of the eurozone and that member states in the area are
better prepared to adjust to global challenges. !e completion of the monetary union is set out in three stages.

_Stage 1 (2015–17)_

!is stage involves making the EMU more resilient by building on existing instruments and making the best

possible use of the existing Treaties.

i. **Deepening the Economic Union by ensuring a new boost to convergence, jobs and growth**

**across the entire eurozone.** !is can be achieved by the creation of a eurozone system of National
Competitiveness Authorities; strengthening the macroeconomic imbalance procedure (which aims to
identify countries facing potential crises), a greater focus on employment and social performance and
a stronger coordination of economic policies.

ii. **Completion of the construction of the Banking Union** which involves setting up a bridge financing

mechanism for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF); implementing concrete steps towards the

common backstop to the SRF; agreeing a common European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) and

improving the effectiveness of the instrument for _direct bank recapitalization_ in the European Stability

Mechanism – for more on the Banking Union see sections 16.34 and 16.35.

iii. **(e launch of a new Capital Markets Union (CMU** ) which involves improving access to financing for

all businesses across Europe and investment projects especially for start-ups, small and medium-sized

enterprises (SMEs) and long-term projects. Increasing and diversifying the sources of funding from

investors in both the EU and globally so that companies (including SMEs) in addition to existing bank

credit lending also have the opportunity to access capital markets. Making the capital markets work

more effectively by connecting investors and those who need funding more e'ciently, both within

member states and cross-border. Finally, making the capital markets more shock resilient by pooling

cross-border private risk-sharing through a deepening integration of bond and equity markets.

_Stage 2 (2017–19)_

During this stage the achievements of the first stage were consolidated. !e European Commission issued a

white paper in March 2017 entitled 'Re$ection Paper on the deepening of the economic and monetary union'

which sets out possible ways forward for deepening and completing the Economic and Monetary Union up

434

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

until 2025. !e report notes that the Economic and Monetary Union still falls short on three fronts: (i) it has

not to date been able to reverse su'ciently the social and economic divergences between and within euro area

members that emerged from the global and eurozone crises, (ii) the need to strengthen citizens' support for

the euro and (iii) while the EMU is stronger, it is not yet fully shock-proof.

_Stage 3 (2020–25)_

!is involves reaching the final stage of 'a deep and genuine EMU' including potential EU Treaty changes

including setting up of new institutions. !ere are three components to this final phase:

i. **A Financial Union:** this involves a continuous implementation of the capital markets initiatives; the

roll out of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme; a transition to the issuance of a European Safe

Asset and changes to the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures.

ii. **An Economic and Fiscal Union:** this involves economic and social convergence supported by new

convergence standards and a link with the central stabilization function. !e central stabilization

function would be subject to a decision on design, preparation of implementation and beginning

   - f operations. !e implementation of the new EU multiannual financial framework with a stronger
focus on incentives for reforms. Finally, there would be a simplification of the rules of the Stability
and Growth Pact.

iii. **Democratic Accountability and Effective Governance:** this involves appointing a full

time permanent chair of the Eurogroup which would be established as an o'cial Council

configuration. A)fully unified external representation of the euro area. !e integration of remaining

intergovernmental arrangements in the EU legal framework. !ere would also be new institutions

including the setting-up of a euro area Treasury and a European Monetary Fund to take over around

&500 billion from the European Stability Mechanism. To take over as a 'lender of the last resort'

function to Eurozone member states.

16.34 THE CREATION OF THE BANKING UNION

As the financial crisis of 2008 evolved and eventually turned into the eurozone debt crisis, it became clear that,

for those countries which shared the euro and were ever more interdependent, a deeper integration of the

banking system was needed. Many commentators argue that at the heart of the eurozone crisis was a banking

crisis. French and German banks had accumulated large holdings of PIIGS debt during the period since the

monetary union, attracted by the slightly higher yields on their debt compared to German bunds. In addition,

banks within the PIIGS also accumulated large holdings of their own government's debt as part of their capital

reserves. When the credit crunch came along in 2007 and the economic fundamentals of the PIIGS economies

deteriorated, the banks in the PIIGS found themselves with large losses on their loan books combined

with losses on their holdings of sovereign debt, meaning a bailout of the banking system in countries like

Ireland, Spain and Greece became essential. In addition, as the eurozone crisis led to the questioning of these

countries' participation in EMU, their citizens started to move their deposits from their local banks to what

were perceived to be safer banks in the UK, Switzerland and Germany. !is capital $ight was understandable

as citizens in, for example, Greece feared that their bank accounts would be redenominated in a new drachma

which would then swi(ly fall in value against the euro, implying large losses on their deposits. On 17 April

2012 the Head of the IMF Christine Lagarde argued that:

435

International Finance

to break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks, we need more risk-sharing across borders

in the banking system. In the near term, a pan-euro area facility that has the capacity to take direct

stakes in banks would help. Looking further ahead, monetary union needs to be supported by stronger

financial integration, which our analysis suggests should be in the form of unified supervision, a single

bank resolution authority with a common backstop, and a single deposit insurance fund.

Her call was supported by the Head of the ECB Mario Draghi who on 25 April argued that 'ensuring a wellfunctioning Economic and Monetary Union implies strengthening banking supervision and resolution at the

European level'.

As such, the First Report called for the completion of the Banking Union covering not only the eurozone but

also other EU member states. !e key elements of the Banking Union are a European-level deposit protection

scheme so as to minimize the risk of capital $ight, common capital ratios and a common regulatory regime

including a European-level banking authority with the power and funds necessary to deal with the problem

- f insolvent banks so they could either be recapitalized or shut down in an orderly fashion. !is would give
depositors and the financial markets some degree of confidence in the European banking system and reduce
the risk of contagion and unnecessary bank runs. Getting the Banking Union in place was not an easy task as
each member state sought rules that favoured its banking system. Countries such as Germany demanded that
there be conditions for access to bailout funds due to their concerns about their taxpayers being called on to
bail out Greek and Spanish banks. A deposit guarantee system would require a common funding based on a
percentage of a bank's deposit base. !ere would also be a problem if the banking union incorporated only
the eurozone area, as the EU is committed to a single market in financial services across the Union as a whole.

16.35 THE COMPLETION OF THE EUROPEAN BANKING UNION

!e European Commission mooted the idea of a Banking Union in September 2012 and has therea(er pursued

a number of initiatives aimed at creating a safer and sounder banking sector, especially for those countries

sharing the euro. !e set of initiatives has become known as the creation of a European Banking Union. !e

initiatives involve a single rulebook for all banks in the European Union, stronger prudential requirements for

banks, improved depositor protection and rules for managing failing banks. !e key elements of the Banking

Union are:

1. !e **Single Rulebook** is the foundation of the banking union. It consists of a set of legislative texts

that all financial institutions (including approximately 8,300 banks) in the EU must comply with.

!ese rules cover issues like capital requirements for banks, ensuring better protection for depositors,

and regulation designed to both prevent and manage bank failures.

2. !e **Single Supervisory Mechanism** (SSM) which came into play in November 2014 places the

European Central Bank (ECB) as the central prudential supervisor of financial institutions in the

euro area (including approximately 6,000 banks) and in those non-euro EU countries that choose to

join the SSM. !e ECB directly supervises the largest banks, while the national supervisors continue

to monitor the remaining banks. !e main task of the ECB and the national supervisors, working

closely together within an integrated system, is to check that banks comply with the EU banking rules

and to tackle emerging problems early on.

3. !e **Single Resolution Mechanism** (SRM) entered force in January 2016 and applies to banks

covered by the SSM. In the cases when banks fail, the mechanism allows bank resolution to be

436

The European Monetary System and European Monetary Union

managed effectively through a Single Resolution Board and a Single Resolution Fund, financed by the

banking sector over an 8-year period based on a levy of 1% of deposits. !e purpose being to ensure

an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimal costs for taxpayers and to the real economy.

4. !e **European Deposit Insurance Scheme** (EDIS) proposed in November 2015 to provide a stronger

and more uniform insurance cover for all retail depositors in the Banking Union. !is would apply

to deposits of up to &100,000 of all banks in the euro area. When a bank is placed into insolvency or

in resolution and it is necessary to pay out depositors or finance their transfer to another bank, the

national deposit guarantee schemes and EDIS will intervene. At the final stage of the EDIS set-up,

the protection of those deposits will be fully financed by EDIS, supported by a close cooperation

between EDIS and member states' national Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS). Given that national

DGS may remain vulnerable to large local shocks, the purpose of EDIS is to ensure equal protection

    - f deposits through the Banking Union regardless of the member state where the deposit is located.

!e)transitioning from member states' deposit guarantee schemes (DGS) to the EDIS is planned

to take seven years; during the transition both banks and national deposit insurance funds would

contribute to the EDIS deposit insurance fund (DIF).

Overall the European Banking Union project is a major change in the regulation of European banking since

it involves the harmonization of banking rules. Importantly, it also represents a major centralization of the

supervision and regulation of banks with responsibility being shi(ed in a significant manner to the ECB

in conjunction with national authorities. !e Single Resolution Mechanism funded by contributions by the

banking sector is a major change in that it shi(s the responsibility away from taxpayers and national authorities

to the more solvent banks. In addition, the EDIS represents a significant cross-country 'mutualization' of

protection for depositors which was previously the responsibility of national deposit insurance schemes.

16.36 THE CREATION OF A CAPITAL MARKETS UNION

On 19 June 2015 the European Commission was requested by the European Economic and Financial Affairs

Council to look into drawing up a roadmap to create a Capital Markets Union (CMU). It has the objective

- f improving investment and savings $ows across the Union to the benefit of businesses and households and
to lower the dependence of the eurozone on the banking sector. More specifically, there were four key aims:

1. **Unlock more investment from the EU and the rest of the world** especially for SMEs and to enable

households with better options to finance their retirements.

**Connect financing more effectively to investment projects across the EU: in particular to channel**

**funds** towards smaller states with high growth potential, with more developed market economies
benefiting from greater cross-border investment and saving opportunities.

3. **Increase the stability of the financial system** by opening a wider range of funding sources than just

banks, increasing long-term investment and reducing the vulnerability of EU citizens and companies

to banking shocks.

4. **Deepen financial integration and increased competition** with greater cross-border risk-sharing and

developing deeper and more liquid markets and lowering funding costs for businesses and citizens.

Progress on creating a CMU has been quite discernible by 2021. !ere have been a range of measures

undertaken to make it easier for firms to raise equity and debt finance, to support the venture capital market,

437

International Finance

improving the securitization market, ensuring the facilitation of greater cross-border investment, facilitating

the creation of pan-European pension products, supervision of clearing houses, enabling greater use of overthe-counter derivatives by institutional investors and measures to improve the way crowdfunding platforms

- perate in the EU.

With the advent of the Covid-19 crisis the EU finance ministers during 2020 and 2021 widened the scope of

the CMU project in order to improve corporations' ability to raise finance to help with the economic recovery

from the Covid-19 crisis and the necessary conversion to a digital and sustainable economy, recognizing that

this will require increased funding on the part of EU companies and SMEs, which cannot be shouldered by

the banking system alone. !e CMU has become an important project for the EU especially in the light of the

exit of the UK from the European Union on 1 January 2020 which negatively impacts the ability of London –

which is by far Europe's largest financial centre – to service EU corporations and citizens.

16.37 THE ACCESSION COUNTRIES AND EMU

When the eight Central Eastern European Countries (CEEC) (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,

Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) along with Malta and Cyprus joined the EU in May 2004 they also

agreed in principle to the adoption of the euro as their national currency at some time in the future; and

none have an 'opt-out' arrangement such as the one negotiated by the UK. !e same applies to Romania and

Bulgaria who joined in January 2007. According to the European Commission and the ECB, the monetary

integration of the new member economies into the euro area should be multilateral (that is, involve the ECB,

existing and new entrants), successive (that is, in stages dependent on economic reform and progress prior

to ERM II entrance) and phased (some join before others). !e new members need to meet the Maastricht

Treaty criteria as a precondition for joining EMU, but in addition they are also expected to achieve some real

convergence, which entails catching up with the rest of Europe in the process of economic development by

speeding up the processes of transition and structural reform.

!e first phase of this process was the pre-accession phase prior to their admittance into the EU in May

2004. During this phase the CEEC adopted the _acquis communautaire_ in respect of EMU – this involved

removal of capital controls, making their central banks independent and prohibiting the central banks from

printing money to finance their fiscal deficits. During the pre-accession phase the CEEC countries were free

to pursue their own independent exchange rate policies.

!e second phase started with their accession and ends with their inclusion in the eurozone. During this

phase the accession states give up some of their monetary autonomy, since their exchange rates are a matter of

common concern, as are their macroeconomic policies (fiscal and monetary). During this period, they need

to avoid excessive $uctuations of their currencies and also misaligned exchange rates (such as undervaluations

which would give them a competitive advantage). Prior to joining EMU they are required to have spent at

least two years with their currencies inside the ERM II arrangement and not to have devalued their currencies

during their membership. When they are assessed to be ready to join EMU they will have no option but to join,

although this is not a major concern since all CEEC countries have already expressed a commitment to do so.

!e third and final phase – the adoption of the euro – starts when the CEEC meet the criteria to join the

eurozone, adopt the euro and cease to use their national currencies. Once they join they have similar rights

and obligations as other eurozone member countries and they will need to respect the fiscal requirements of

the SGP and their national central banks will join in the ESCB arrangements. To date, seven of these countries

(Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Malta, Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania) have joined the eurozone, bringing its

membership to 19. Table 16.11 shows that the remaining potential entrants have lower national debts than

most of the existing eurozone members and need mainly to achieve lower long-term bond yields to meet the

Maastricht Treaty conditions.

!ere are important issues posed by increasing the EMU membership: too early an entry of the weaker

countries into the eurozone could further undermine confidence in the euro and require a looser European

monetary policy than would otherwise be the case. !ere is also no doubt that, with more member states

joining the euro at very different levels of economic development, the design of the optimal monetary policy is

made a more complicated task for the ECB. However, these risks should not be exaggerated: the new member

economies are only a small part of the European Union GDP and there are plenty of safeguards in place to

ensure the euro will remain a low-in$ation currency. Another interesting point is that the post-2007 financial

crisis and Covid-19 crisis have raised the national debts of countries like France and Germany to well above

the 60% national debt entrance criterion of the Maastricht Treaty, so potential new entrants who meet this

condition will be in better fiscal shape than most of the current members of the eurozone.

16.38 CONCLUSIONS

Although the EMS was originally envisaged as a zone of monetary stability, it differed from a simple agreement

to peg exchange rates in a number of important respects, such as the central role of the ECU, the setting-up

- f a common pool of reserves, the individualization of divergence thresholds and the theoretically symmetric
responsibilities for surplus and deficit countries. However, the EMS was certainly far from a monetary union.
!ere was no ECB to supply the ECU, which was a mere calculation and far from a medium of exchange.
!e EMS transformed itself from a zone of currency stability into a credible anti-in$ation zone, and its final
transformation was to become a framework for achieving EMU. Its success as an anti-in$ation zone can be
partly explained by the fact that, following the experience of the 1970s, there was a greater commitment by
governments to control in$ation. Furthermore, the associated cost in terms of higher unemployment levels
did not prove to be politically disastrous for the governments concerned. While EMS members did bring
down their in$ation rates, especially in the cases of Italy and France, this does not establish causality. It may
well have been the case that Italy and France would have engaged in an anti-in$ationary set of policies even
if they had not joined the EMS.

439

International Finance

During the 1980s and 1990s the balance of benefits and costs tipped increasingly favourably towards

EMU. In the way of benefits, the single market project, by tackling non-tariff barriers to trade and

requiring the removal of capital controls, made the usage of differing national currencies look increasingly

ine'cient. On the other hand, the main cost associated with EMU, namely the loss of monetary policy

sovereignty, had already largely been given up by members of the ERM who accepted the monetary

discipline of the Bundesbank. For this reason, France and Italy became increasingly interested in EMU

partly because it would give them a greater say in the conduct of monetary policy as members of the

board of the ECB.

!e PIIGS crisis has shown that, in retrospect, the overlooking of the 60% national debt criterion for

entrance to EMU was a mistake. By admitting countries like Italy and Greece, the eurozone made itself

vulnerable to a speculative attack on those countries with high national debts. On the other hand, the policy of

bailing out bond holders who knew the risks they undertook when buying PIIGS debt must also be questioned.

If bondholders fail to diversify their portfolios appropriately, then there is not really a case in a capitalist

system for bailing them out. Banks are supposedly sophisticated investors who should understand the need to

appropriately diversify their sovereign bond exposures, and the shareholders of those banks should be forced

to accept the losses rather than be bailed out by taxpayers of whatever country.

!e survival of the EMU is an issue that extends well beyond the 19 eurozone members. A break-up of

the eurozone would likely cause chaos in the financial markets, and the likely recession that would follow in

the eurozone countries would adversely impact on trading partners such as the UK, the USA, Japan, China

and the rest of the global economy. Despite the PIIGS crisis the euro has survived intact and is backed by a

credible ECB with greater supervision and regulatory powers. !e eurozone is also greatly strengthened by

the emergence of a European Banking Union, a Capital Markets Union and in due course the setting up of

a European Monetary Fund to replace the Single Resolution Mechanism. !e euro itself is likely to remain a

major alternative to the dollar. In 2019 the enlarged eurozone GDP of \$13,335 billion was some way behind

the US GDP of \$21,433 billion, while GDP per capita in the USA was \$65,298 which is significantly higher

than the eurozone average of \$38,985. In 2019 the eurozone area accounted for 15.2% of world output, lower

than the 24.5% share of the United States. However, in 2018 the eurozone export total (excluding intra-EU

trade) was 15.7% of global GDP while the USA export total was 11.7% of global GDP. Against this, US capital

markets are around twice the size of the combined EU markets, and the dollar dominance may take some

time to be overcome. Some authors such as Cohen (2003) are sceptical about whether the euro will challenge

the dollar as the major international currency in the foreseeable future. However, a shi( towards the euro as

a reserve currency up from 18.3% of foreign currency reserves in 2000 to 20.7% in 2018 and lower holdings

- f dollar reserves down from 71.1% in 2000 to 61.7% in 2018 has occurred over time as countries like China,
Korea, India and Russia have diversified their risks from US Treasury bonds, regardless of the merits or

- otherwise of the euro.

!e euro crisis revealed some significant $aws in the design of the EMU project that were not fully

appreciated when it was launched in 1999. !e first $aw was that the criteria for admission to EMU were not

fully adhered to. In particular, the 60% ceiling on the national debt criterion was ignored. !is meant that

countries like Italy and Greece were admitted with national debts over 100% of GDP, well above the Maastricht

limit. While the SGP was designed to ensure fiscal rectitude following EMU, it was not fully appreciated

what the impact of a major recession would do to fiscal balances and national debt dynamics. !e 2008–12

recession revealed that several countries' debt dynamics were unsustainable in the face of a significant adverse

economic shock. !e other key $aw in the system was the limited role for the ECB as a lender of last resort:

its SMP purchases of government bonds, liquidity provision and LTRO policies were controversial and seen

by some German policy-makers as contrary to the no-bailout principle. If the ECB had a lender of the last

resort function it might have been able to forestall the crisis by making it clear to market participants that

their sovereign bond holdings in the PIIGS would be repaid in full. !is would have helped to keep down their

borrowing rates and reduced the risk of contagion.

!e euro survived the PIIGS crisis intact and the European Central Bank has shown a strong commitment

to maintain the integrity of the eurozone area with its willingness to undertake a series of quantitative easing

measures. !ere was a period during the eurozone crisis when Greece was on the verge of leaving the eurozone

and/or defaulting on its debt. However, the support of the German government, the ECB being prepared to

'do whatever it takes' and subsequent restructuring of Greek debt have enabled the eurozone to increase rather

than decrease its membership.

Even though the eurozone survived the PIIGS crisis, the recent large increases in fiscal deficits and

national debts and falls in the eurozone GDP resulting from the Covid-19 crisis of 2020–21 will present new

challenges for many of the eurozone countries. !e Covid-19 crisis means that there remains a continued

need for certain countries to bring down their fiscal deficits and national debts to much more manageable and

sustainable levels, along with continued progress on restoring the competitiveness of their economies. It also

involves undertaking what in the short term are painful structural reforms designed to improve the workings

- f goods and labour markets. In addition, there remains a need for banks to reduce their sovereign exposures
and continue the process of deleveraging and restoring their balance sheets to a healthier state. Such reforms
will)take many years to implement, will usually meet stiff resistance and, even when in place, will take time
to bear fruit.

Following the eurozone crisis, it became clear that a successful European Monetary Union required

progress to be made not only on fiscal deficits but also a stronger institutional framework in the form of

progress towards a Banking Union and Capital Markets Union. In this respect, once fully implemented the

Banking and Capital Market Unions will be a significant step in the right direction towards providing a much

stronger framework for the EMU project. Some go further and suggest that it even requires some form of

political union if it is ultimately to survive and prosper. On balance, the chances are that the eurozone will

remain intact and is unlikely to lose any of its members for the foreseeable future. Indeed, it is likely to

continue to gradually increase in size; this is due to a number of factors. !e EMU project is in many ways a

political rather than economic project and, given the enormous political capital that was expended in setting

up the project in the first instance, one should not underestimate the political will present to keep the project

alive. Ultimately, it is political will that will decide the fate of the euro. A country leaving the euro would also

raise the prospects of severe economic contagion as speculators attacked the next candidate country likely to

leave. !ere would also be bank runs in countries where it was felt that exit from the euro was a significant

probability, leading to the need for such banks to be rescued. From a legal standpoint, there is currently no

provision for a country to leave the eurozone and there would be huge problems in both financial markets

and the real economy concerning the validity and valuation of outstanding contracts. As such, the costs of

countries leaving are substantially higher than the costs of staying in the eurozone, for both the country

concerned and other key countries such as France and Germany.

17.1 INTRODUCTION

!e 1990s and early part of this century were characterized by a number of currency and financial crises.

!e turmoil started with major speculative attacks against the EMS in 1992–93 which led to devaluations

- f the pound sterling and the Italian lira, followed by the Mexican crisis of December 1994. !en, starting
with the !ai baht devaluation on 2 July 1997, the so-called East Asian financial crisis is generally agreed to
have started. !e Asian crisis was characterized by major economic and financial turmoil in many of the East
Asian economies with large falls in the values of their currencies, stock markets and property prices. !e crisis
continued into 1998, a year in which there were very significant falls in output in many of these previously
fast-growing economies. Fortunately, there was a sharp recovery of those economies in 1999 and 2000 by
which time the crisis was largely over.

!e Asian financial crisis was swi(ly followed by other crises such as the Russian default on its debt in

August 1998 and the collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in late September 1998.

Other noticeable crises followed: in January 1999 the Brazilian real was forced to devalue and eventually to

$oat, quickly depreciating a further 35%; in January 2001 there was a major banking crisis in Turkey, leading

to the $oating of the Turkish lira; and, more spectacularly, in December 2001 Argentina declared a default on

its external debt and abandoned its currency board on 7 January 2002 with a devaluation from 1 to 1.4 pesos

per dollar, swi(ly followed by a dramatic fall to a low of 3.75 pesos per dollar by the end of October 2002.

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

!ese periodic crises have stimulated a great deal of theoretical and empirical literature that looks at the

causes of currency and financial crises, and in this chapter we look at some of the theoretical models that have

been developed to analyse such crises. In particular, we will look at what have been termed first-, secondand

third-generation models of currency crises, and we will explain some of their basic features and differences.

We will also brie$y mention some of the other models that have been developed. We then concentrate on

the causes and details surrounding the East Asian financial crisis, which was one of the most significant

events to confront the international financial community in the last 40 years. We focus attention on eight

- f the countries most directly involved in the crisis, namely Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, South
Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and !ailand, and as such we will exclude any detailed analysis of other
countries affected by the crisis such as China and India. A great deal of money can be made by predicting
crises in advance of them happening, and early warning of such crises may help policy-makers to avert them.
We conclude the chapter by looking at some of the recent literature that attempts to find what economic and
financial indicators may be useful to predict currency and financial crises.

17.2 FIRST-GENERATION MODELS OF CURRENCY CRISES

First-generation models refer to a strand of literature that builds upon an article by Krugman (1979) and

which has been extended and developed in various directions; see for example Flood and Garber (1984).

In his article, Krugman assumed that a government operates a fixed exchange rate and runs a budget deficit

financed by the government selling bonds in exchange for money from the central bank; that is, its fiscal

deficits are financed)by domestic credit expansion. However, this increases the supply of money and puts

downward pressure on the interest rate leading to capital out$ows and pressure for a devaluation of the

currency. As such, it is necessary for the central bank to defend the currency by using its foreign exchange

reserves. At)a certain point, the reserves reach a critically low level and a speculative attack is made on the

currency, forcing a devaluation. In the so-called 'first generation models of speculative currency attacks'

there) is a fundamental inconsistency between the fiscal (and with it monetary) policy pursued by the

government and)the commitment to a fixed exchange rate, which is spotted by speculators and precipitates a

speculative attack.

!e assumptions of the Krugman (1979) model are: perfect competition in the economy; domestic and

foreign goods are perfect substitutes; perfect capital mobility and uncovered interest parity (UIP) holds at all

times; and purchasing power parity holds. In the Krugman model, money demand is assumed to be fixed at

some constant value and the exchange rate is assumed to be fixed so that _s_ _[. ]_ = 0, where _s_ _[.]_ is the rate of change

- f the exchange rate. A final important feature of the model is that once the fixed exchange rate regime breaks
down, the new regime that replaces it is a fully $oating one.

!e first assumption is that the money market is kept in continual equilibrium, that is:

_mdt_ = _[—]_ _mst_ (17.1)

where _mdt_ is the log of money demand, and _[—]_ _mst_ is the log of the fixed money supply.

!e demand for real money balance is assumed to be inversely related to the domestic interest rate:

_mdt_                  - _p_ =���� _r_ (17.2)

where _p_ is the log of the domestic price level and _r_ is the domestic interest rate.

443

International Finance

!e log of the money supply is given by a log linearization of the domestic credit and foreign exchange

reserves:

_—_

_mst_ =� _D_                     - � _R_ (17.3)

where _D_ is the log of domestic credit and _R_ is the log of the reserve component of the monetary base. (Note

equation (17.3) is strictly true only in _levels_ but is an acceptable log-linearization approximation in the

literature.)

!e domestic credit is assumed to expand at a constant rate per annum _D_ _[˙]_ = . where _D_ _[˙]_ is the rate of change

- f domestic credit. !e increase in domestic credit is assumed to come about because of the government
printing money to buy domestic bonds that are being sold to finance its fiscal deficit.

!e exchange rate is assumed to follow PPP so that:

_s_ = _p_                           - _p_                           - (17.4)

where _s_ is the log of the exchange rate defined as domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, _p_ is the

log of the domestic price level and _p_ - is the log of the foreign price level.

UIP is assumed to hold at all times so:

_r_ = _r_                         -                         - _Es_ / (17.5)

where _r_ is the domestic interest rate, _r_ - is the foreign interest rate and _Es_ / is the expected rate of depreciation

- f the domestic currency.

Since money demand is a constant, any increase in domestic credit will, as in the monetary model, lead to a

fall in reserves of an equivalent amount, which implies that the rate of fall of reserves _R˙_ is the same as the rate

- f increase of domestic credit; that is:

_R˙_ =                              - . (17.6)

Finally, assuming the exchange rate is fixed at _s¯_ and _Es_ / = 0, the foreign interest rate at _r_  - = _r_ and the foreign

price level is fixed at _p_ *, we can substitute equations (17.1) to (17.3) and (17.5) into equation (17.4) to obtain:

_s¯_ = R                                           - D                                           - � p*                                           - +r* (17.7)

Since we assume that _p_ - and _r_ - are fixed, increases in domestic credit lead to equivalent falls in foreign

exchange reserves and there is no change in the money supply. It is quite clear that if foreign exchange reserves

are falling at the same rate that domestic credit is expanding, at some point they will reach a critically low

level. It is not a foregone conclusion that a speculative attack will necessarily follow a decline in the reserves;

however, if the central bank announces that once reserves hit a certain level they will abandon the fixed

exchange rate then a speculative attack is a foregone conclusion. !e interesting thing is that speculators will

not wait until the reserves reach the critically low level before mounting the speculative attack since this would

imply a large capital loss at that point. Rational speculators will launch the speculative attack before the critical

level of reserves is met. Flood and Garber (1984) have shown that the speculative attack will occur when the

rate of exchange that would occur if the currency were $oating (the so-called shadow exchange rate) is equal

to the fixed exchange rate and that the speculative attack will completely drain the foreign exchange reserves

- f the central bank. !e dynamics of the speculative attack are illustrated in Figure 17.1.

In Figure 17.1(a) it can be seen that the money supply is fixed at the level _M_ 1 at time _t_ 1, domestic credit

is expanding at a rate _D_ _[˙]_ = . and the reserves are falling by a like amount at the rate _R˙_ = - . with the money

supply remaining constant. !e shadow exchange rate in Figure 17.1(b) starts at an overvalued level _S_ 1 but

would, if the exchange rate were $oating, depreciate at a rate _s_ / = . in line with the rate of increase of domestic

credit. While the fixed exchange rate of the peso per dollar is undervalued at, say, 2 pesos per dollar compared

to the shadow exchange rate, say 1.5 pesos per dollar, it is possible to maintain a fixed exchange rate without

any problems since there is no prospect of a capital gain for speculators. However, once the shadow exchange

rate moves above the fixed exchange rate making the latter overvalued at time _T_, for example 2.01 pesos per

dollar, a speculative attack is inevitable as it pays speculators to sell unlimited quantities of domestic currency

(pesos) to buy the foreign currency (dollars) – the authorities’ foreign exchange reserves will be exhausted

and the currency is forced to $oat. It should be noted that at the precise time of the speculative attack there is

an increase in the domestic interest rate to compensate investors for the fact that a(er the speculative attack

the exchange rate is expected to depreciate at the rate µ, in line with the expansion of domestic credit – this

follows from the UIP condition. !e timing of the attack is such that there is no discrete jump in the exchange

rate, as this would imply large capital losses for speculators at that point; but since the inevitable breakdown

- f the fixed parity is foreseen in advance this would be inconsistent with an e'cient market and therefore can
be ruled out.

At the time of the speculative attack the reserves are exhausted and fall by an amount d _R_ (negative), hence,

there is a discrete fall in the money supply of a like amount d _ms_ (negative). !ere is also a rise in the domestic

interest rate given by µ (since this is the rate at which the currency is expected to depreciate in line with the

growth of domestic credit), so that _r_ becomes _r_ - µ. Inserting this into the money demand equation (17.2)

means there is a fall in money demand given by d _md_ =�� +µ. Since the money market is kept in continual

equilibrium the fall in the money supply equals the fall in money demand, so that:

d _R_ =����� (17.8)

445

International Finance

Since before the speculative attack reserves were falling at the rate µ, if the initial stock of reserves is given by

_R_ 1 and the time from the base period to the attack is given by _T_, then the level of reserves just prior to the

attack must be _R_ 1 - µ _T_ (positive) which must be equal to the fall in reserves that occurs at the time of the

attack - d _R_ (positive since d _R_ is negative). !at is:

_R_ 1                 - µ _T_ =�� d _R_ (17.9)

Substituting (17.8) into (17.9) and rearranging to solve for the timing of the speculative attack _T_, we find:

_R_ 1 σµ

_T_

µ

(17.10)

!at is, the timing of the speculative attack is greater (that is, delayed) the higher the initial level of reserves

_R_ 1 and the lower the rate of expansion of domestic credit µ. !is condition makes sound intuitive economic

sense: the higher the level of reserves, the greater the ability of the authorities to resist a speculative attack; and

the lower the rate of domestic credit expansion of domestic credit, the slower the drain on the reserves from

domestic credit expansion.

!ere have been several criticisms of the first-generation models, including the following:

1. It is unclear why the level of foreign exchange reserves should be so crucial to the timing of a

speculative attack, since governments could always resist an attack on their currencies by other

means such as raising the domestic interest rate. If they raise interest rates su'ciently this will lead to

potential losses for speculators that have borrowed large amounts of the domestic currency so as to

sell it in the foreign exchange market.

It is not at all clear why a government that is committed to a fixed exchange rate regime would wish

to pursue a policy of printing money to finance its fiscal deficit that it knows will ultimately lead to

a speculative attack on its currency. In the real world, it is likely that governments are far smarter

than assumed in the first-generation models and will look at the costs and benefits of maintaining a

fixed exchange rate system as well as keeping the option of allowing their currency to $oat prior to a

speculative attack.

3. !ere was also an empirical problem in that some of the post-1980s crises were not characterized by

large fiscal deficits that had been monetarized as assumed in the first-generation models. !ere had

been no secular change in the fundamentals prior to the ERM crises in 1992–93 as predicted by these

models, and the ERM crises were largely unforeseen. In addition, as we shall see, most of the Asian

economies were running fiscal surpluses prior to the outbreak of their crises.

4. A further empirical problem is that in some of the recent crises there was not a secular fall in the

foreign exchange reserves as predicted by the first-generation models. In the Asian economies heavy

capital in$ows in the years prior to the outbreak of the crises had meant that foreign exchange

reserves had been increasing as central banks sold their currencies to buy US dollars to offset the

excess demand for their currencies from capital in$ows. As we shall see, it was in fact an abrupt

change from capital in$ows to capital out$ows that led to the currency and financial crises in these

economies.

446

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

17.3 SECOND-GENERATION MODELS OF CURRENCY CRISES

Due to the deficiencies of the first-generation models in explaining currency crises, in particular the

speculative attack on the ERM that occurred in 1992–93, a new generation of models emerged in the 1990s

(see, for example, Obstfeld, 1994, 1996; Jeanne, 1997, who offers an alternative explanation of currency crises).

Two key features of the second-generation models are that governments are assumed to be much smarter

than in the first-generation models; that is, they continually evaluate the pros and cons of maintaining a

fixed exchange rate, and the linkage between macro-fundamentals and the timing of speculative attacks is

much weaker than in the first-generation models. In fact some authors such as Rangvid (2001) contend that

the key distinction between firstand second-generation models is that in the latter the government seeks to

minimize some sort of loss function, for instance deviations of output or in$ation rates from their desired

levels. In the second-generation models, a devaluation is seen as an optimal response by the government to

speculative pressures against the currency. !e second-generation models allow for the possibility that the

private sector anticipating a devaluation can increase the costs to the devaluing government of not devaluing

such that it becomes rational for the government to devalue. In such models, there is the possibility of _multiple_

_equilibria_ ; that is, if private agents' expectations of devaluation are low then the costs of maintaining a fixed

exchange rate are low and hence the government of the country will not devalue. On the other hand, if private

agents' expectations of devaluation are high then the costs of maintaining a fixed exchange rate are high and

the government accordingly has a higher incentive to devalue. In such models, private agents' expectations

can become self-fulfilling in the sense that if there is an exogenous shock to their expectations, such that they

move from a low to a high risk of devaluation, then the probability of a devaluation will rise accordingly. !ere

are usually three key components to the second-generation models:

Government preferences: the costs and benefits to the authorities of maintaining a fixed exchange

rate are continually reviewed and modelled. !e authorities are assumed to attach some weight

to exchange rate stability and some weight to a real variable such as output stability or the rate of

unemployment. For example a possible loss function is:

_L_ = ( _y_ t                       - _y_ *) [2]                       - � _w_ ( _s_ t                       - 1                       - _s_ t) [2]

where _y_ t is the log of current level of output, _y_    - is the log of desired level of output, _s_ t+1 is the log of

exchange rate one period hence, _s_ t is the log of exchange rate today, and _w_ is a weighting parameter.

Here the idea is that the government attaches some importance to stability of output and

some importance to stability of the exchange rate. A link between changes in the exchange rate

and deviations of output can then be introduced. For instance, a sudden increase in expectations

    - f a devaluation might lead to higher wage demands (since the price level will rise following a

devaluation) and a rise in real wages in the short term, which leads to a fall in output below the

desired level.

Specification of the real variable: different second-generation models specify different real

variables that are affected by an expected devaluation; this may be the level of output, the level of

unemployment or the real level of public debt. An expected devaluation will likely lead to a fall in

    - utput (due to wage rises in anticipation of devaluation) or a rise in unemployment (for example, by

raising interest rates to compensate for the risk of a devaluation) or the cost of servicing the public

debt (since an expected devaluation will raise the required interest rate).

447

International Finance

!ere is a fixed cost to devaluation: the second-generation models assume that if a government is

forced to devalue then there will be a given cost to it, and this cost might be seen as a loss of political

prestige due to a failure to carry out the stated fixed exchange rate policy or a loss of economic

credibility.

In second-generation models, some sort of shock comes along to alter private agents' expectations of a

devaluation. If the shock is small then the costs of maintaining the fixed exchange rate will be relatively small

and it is likely that the authorities will be able to continue with the fixed exchange rate regime. If, however, the

shock is relatively large and private agents' expectations of the size of a potential devaluation become quite

large, this increases the cost to the government of maintaining the fixed exchange rate; for example the loss

- f output will rise, making it more likely that the government will decide to abandon the fixed exchange rate.
One of the key features of second-generation models is the more the expectation of a devaluation, the more
the cost to the government of maintaining the fixed exchange rate and the higher the actual devaluation that
is required. For instance, if agents expect a high rate of devaluation they will then put in high wage demands
which leads to a high loss of output; hence, it will pay the government to enact a large devaluation to ensure
that realized prices rise by a large amount and that real wages remain constant, so minimizing the loss of

- output that occurs. !e subsequent switch to $oating will also permit the authorities to engage in a monetary
expansion to cure high levels of unemployment.

Another key feature of second-generation models is that there can be sudden switches in private agents'

expectations concerning a devaluation without any apparent change in the economic fundamentals. An

economy with sound fundamentals and low expectations of a devaluation can suddenly be exposed to

a speculative attack and a high probability of devaluation simply because of a sudden change in private

agents' expectations of a devaluation without any significant change in macro-fundamentals. It is, however,

important to note that an increase in private agents' expectations of a devaluation will not necessarily lead

to an actual devaluation in the second-generation models. !e government is continually monitoring the

costs and benefits of the devaluation and if, for instance, the fixed costs of devaluation are relatively high then

the government may decide it is best not to devalue, whereas if the fixed costs of devaluation are relatively

low the government might decide to devalue. Nonetheless, the probability of a devaluation in the secondgeneration models is affected by the state of the fundamentals. If the fundamentals are very bad (for example,

unemployment is very high) then a devaluation is more likely than when the fundamentals are good (for

example, unemployment is low), since private agents' rational expectations of the government adopting a

devaluation increase when unemployment is high rather than when it is low.

While the second-generation models have provided some new insights and in particular assume much

smarter governments than in first-generation models, there remain several problems which they do not

satisfactorily deal with. In particular, the reason why private agents should switch expectations from a low

state of probability of devaluation to a high probability is not clear. In addition, the precise state of financial

markets prior to the outbreak of the crisis is not fully considered in the second-generation models.

17.4 THIRD-GENERATION AND OTHER MODELS OF CURRENCY AND FINANCIAL CRISES

In addition to the firstand second-generation models, in an attempt to explain properly the Asian financial

crises, so-called third-generation models of currency crises have been developed. Indeed, there has been

an extensive range of other models designed to explain financial and currency crises. !e third-generation

models were developed because it was noted that there had not been severe fiscal problems in the Asian

448

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

economies prior to the outbreak of the crises as one might have expected from the first-generation models.

In addition, there were also no significant monetary expansions a(er the crisis as might have been expected

from the second-generation models. !e third-generation models vary greatly in their assumptions, but they

have a common theme that financial crises (rather than currency crises _per se_ ) can be caused by a 'moral

hazard' problem. Such a problem exists when the existence of an insurance policy makes the insured-against

event)more likely to occur than if no such insurance policy existed (see Box 17.1 for a simple example of

moral)hazard).

Models such as Akerlof and Romer (1994), Burnside et al. (2001), Corsetti et al. (1999), Dooley (2000),

Edison et al. (1999), Krugman (1998a, 1998b) and McKinnon and Pill (1996) argue that a crucial role in

the occurrence of a financial/currency crisis is played when private agents perceive financial intermediaries'

liabilities as having an implicit government guarantee. !is enables the financial intermediaries in the country

to borrow money at relatively low rates of interest and then lend it out in highly risky investments, leading

for example to property and stock market bubbles and even outright fraud. When things go wrong agents

know/assume that the government will come along to bail out the affected banks. Krugman (1998a) has

characterized this mentality as 'to play a game of heads I win, tails the taxpayer loses'. As asset prices rise, the

lending looks to be sound but eventually the asset bubbles burst and a vicious circle comes into play as the

proportion of non-performing loans rises and asset prices decline. Once the bubble appears to be bursting,

it can also trigger a large capital out$ow from the country and a collapse of the exchange rate of the country

involved.

In addition to the models discussed, there have been numerous others designed to explain why financial

crises occur. Blanchard and Watson (1982) emphasize the importance of 'rational' financial bubbles, where

economic agents continue to buy what are perceived to be overvalued financial assets (or even real assets

such as property) in the belief that the prospective capital gain from a continuation of the upward trend will

more than compensate for the risk of a sudden collapse. Of course, an eventual collapse does occur resulting

**Box 17.1 Moral hazard and how a government bailout guarantee can turn a**
**bad investment into a good one**

!e third-generation financial-crisis models focus attention on the problem of 'moral hazard', whereby

explicit or even perceived government guarantees to bail out investors can make the probability of such

bailouts more likely to occur than if no such explicit/implicit guarantees existed. Consider the following

simple numerical example. An investment project requires \$80 million and will generate a profit of \$40

million with a probability of 40%, and a loss of \$40 million with a probability of 60%. !e expected

return from the project is therefore negative, since (\$40 million  - 0.4) + (–\$40 million * 0.6) = –\$8

million. Clearly this investment does not make economic sense and will not therefore be undertaken

and will not require any government rescue package. Imagine, however, that a government keen to see

the investment go ahead guarantees investors that if the project does not work they will be bailed out by

the taxpayer so as not to make any losses on their investment. In this case, the expected return on the

project becomes positive since (\$40 million * 0.4) + (\$0 million * 0.6) = +\$16 million, or a 20% return

in large capital losses for those caught out near the top of the bubble. Other models such as Radlett and Sachs

(1998) emphasize the role of financial panic which usually happens out of the blue; an important element of

such models is that otherwise-solvent borrowers face a liquidity squeeze when short-term liabilities exceed

their short-term assets. Another model is that of Sachs (1995) who discusses the role of disorderly workouts

in financial crises. A disorderly workout occurs when there is a lack of coordination between creditors who

decide individually to withdraw funds from the distressed borrower. !e lack of coordination between

borrowers may be based on the fact that local bankruptcy laws are absent or ineffective. Another model worthy

- f mention, where current account deficits financed by capital in$ows can provoke a crisis, is that of Rigobon
(1998) where excessive optimism leads to massive capital in$ows that are suddenly and abruptly reversed
when a shock hits the system. In Rigobon's model, economic growth, to the extent that it fuels unrealistic
expectations about long-run economic growth prospects, can be accompanied by overinvestment, excessive
reliance on foreign capital and insu'cient monitoring of domestic investments.

Other models emphasize the role of contagion behaviour on the part of investors. Fratzcher's (2003) paper

is interesting in this respect. Defining contagion as 'the transmission of a crisis to a particular country due to

its real and financial interdependence with countries that are already experiencing a crisis' (p. 110), Fratzcher

argues that contagion provides an adequate description of both the Asian crisis of 1997/98 and the Latin

American crisis of 1994. In the paper, it is the proximity of a country to another country under speculative

attack that triggers the contagion. Various forms of _financial interdependence_ can exist, such as cross-border

holdings between banks and financial institutions within a region, or a common creditor to banks in a

region)– and should the common creditor withdraw from the region then all the countries in the region will

be affected. In addition, _real interdependence_ can exist via bilateral trade $ows or trade competition between

countries so that a crisis in one country might lead to a fall in exports of another or a devaluation of one

currency necessitates a devaluation of another currency to maintain its competitive position. Fratzcher finds

that the degree of trade linkages and competition in the Asian region was high, as was the degree of financial

integration (for example, as measured by correlations of their stock markets and competition between banks).

Fratzcher also finds that the degree of interdependence is very much related to the regional proximity of

countries to one another. For instance, the Asian economies have much higher degrees of financial and real

linkages between each other than with Latin America, and likewise Latin American economies have much

higher degrees of financial and real linkages between themselves than with Asia. Fratzcher finds that the main

linkage through which contagion is likely to have spread is the financial linkage, which is significant in most

cases, whereas the real linkages, while important, are generally speaking less significant. In particular, the

study shows that bank contagion, the withdrawal of funds and refusal of banks to roll over their loans to the

region may have been very significant explanations of the crisis.

Baig and Goldfajn (1999) examine stock markets, foreign exchanges, interest rates and sovereign spreads

using high-frequency data and find that correlations between the East Asian economies increased during the

crisis as did their sensitivity to both good and bad news in the other economies, all of which supports the

idea)of contagion being significant in the crisis. A paper by Caramazza et al. (2004) finds a significant role

played by financial contagion in the Mexican, Asian and Russian crises, particularly through the common

creditor route.

Some theories use herd behaviour as an explanation of currency and financial crises. For example, Calvo

(1996) and Calvo and Mendoza (2000) argue that emerging markets are particularly susceptible to a herd

mentality on the part of investors. Investors find it costly and potentially risky to examine the state of each

economy when there are signs of problems, and so it becomes optimal for them to pull out of a group of

related markets simultaneously when they spot signs of nervousness in just one of them. Likewise, Masson

(1998) argues that investor psychology can play a role – a small trigger can lead to investors collectively losing

450

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

confidence and collectively perceiving a higher risk of holding an investment in a set of countries. !is then

leads investors to follow each other and simultaneously pull their funds out of a region, causing financial

and economic distress to the region. !e foregoing overview of the literature is deliberately selective but

nonetheless provides us with a useful toolkit with which to study the East Asian financial crisis.

17.5 THE RUN-UP TO THE ASIAN CRISIS

One of the most fascinating things about the Asian financial meltdown is that it was largely unforeseen, and

there is plenty of anecdotal evidence for this. !e IMF in its _World Economic Outlook_ publication of April

1997 predicted strong, albeit marginally slower, economic growth of over 5% for Asia in 1998 (excluding India

and Japan). !ere were some expressions of concern about Indonesia but no real alarm bells seemed to have

been ringing at the IMF. Also it seems that international investors remained confident as net capital $ows

continued into the region right up until the crisis broke; only in !ailand and Korea did capital $ows begin to

dry up somewhat earlier in 1996. In addition, Cline and Barnes (1997) show the spread between Asian dollardenominated debt and that on US Treasury bonds was actually falling between mid-1995 and mid-1997,

contrary to what one would expect if market participants were expecting a crisis. Furthermore, Standard &

Poor's and Moody's sovereign credit ratings remained largely unchanged in the year preceding the outbreak

- f the crisis and the eventual downgrades happened only three to five months a(er the crisis had broken out!
In addition, many stock markets in the region were reaching new peaks as late as July 1997, which indicates
that market participants were not forecasting the likely extent of the fall of the markets that subsequently

- occurred. Finally, currency forecasts by investment banks in the region did not predict any significant moves
in exchange rates.

17.6 THE MACROECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS

!e fact that the crisis was largely unforeseen is consistent with the hypothesis that the economic fundamentals,

while deteriorating in the run-up to the crisis, were not of a significant enough measure to justify the crisis.

To advance this hypothesis a bit further we need to look at the economic performance of the economies in the

run-up to the crisis. Firstly, we look at the economic growth rates, secondly their in$ation rates, and finally

we examine their current account positions. We then proceed to look at what is regarded as the key to the

crisis, which was the excessive lending to the region which fuelled asset bubbles (see, for example, Sarno and

Taylor (1999) who detect asset bubbles in all the affected economies, the inevitable bursting of which then led

to a large degree of panic on the part of foreign banks and investors who decided _en masse_ to pull funds out

- f the region). Once the property and stock market bubbles burst, there was a significant deterioration in the
quality of the asset side of banks' balance sheets in the region, as witnessed by a significant increase in their
non-performing loans.

Table 17.1 shows that economic growth rates in the Asian economies were extremely high in the run-up

to the crisis, with real growth rates in the region of 6–9%; only the Philippines was suffering from low growth

in the early 1990s, though from 1996 even it was growing at over 5%. High rates of economic growth are

generally speaking a good thing unless they are fuelled by excessive debt and/or deterioration in the external

accounts of a country. It is quite possible that the prolonged period of economic prosperity sowed the seeds of

its own destruction in that it led economic agents to have unduly optimistic expectations for the future. In the

case of Asia this may well have been the case; terms like the 'Asian miracle' had become part of the domestic

and international perception of Asia. With respect to the stock markets and the property sector the high rates

- f economic growth may have led to unwarranted extrapolative expectations and to some extent prices were
driven up by expectations of further price rises rather than a more realistic appraisal of the relevant economic
fundamentals.

_Inflation rates_

!e in$ation rate can play a significant part in economic crises, especially if the exchange rate is fixed, since

higher domestic in$ation relative to foreign in$ation can cause an appreciation of the real exchange rate and

the in$ation rate itself can be taken as a sign of economic mismanagement. However, there is relatively little

evidence (see Table 17.2) that in$ation was a significant factor in the run-up to the crisis. Given the strong

economic growth in the region, in$ation was surprisingly benign, although there may well have been some

masking of the underlying in$ation due to the existence of price controls in Malaysia and Indonesia.

!e in$ation rate is more likely to lead to real exchange rate appreciation, so undermining the competitiveness

- f countries when a country has a fixed exchange rate. In Asia the exchange rate policies varied in their
degree of fixity with regard to the US dollar. !ailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and the Philippines had more or
less fixed parities, while Korea and !ailand had less rigid, crawling peg systems whereby the exchange rate
was adjusted on occasion to maintain external competitiveness. Indonesia had a policy of targeting the real
exchange rate allowing its currency to depreciate to the extent that its in$ation rate was higher than that of its
trading partners.

Table 17.3 shows the value of the real exchange rate in the countries in the run-up to the crisis. What is

clear is that four of the currencies – the Hong Kong dollar, the Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and

the Philippines dollar – all appreciated in real terms prior to the crisis, and as such might have been vulnerable

to a speculative attack. However, the picture is not uniform since four of the currencies had depreciated in real

terms, so there is little evidence that real exchange rate appreciation played any significant role in the crisis

by providing speculators with the prospect of a discrete fall in some of the Asian currencies. It seems that by

1997 only Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore were potentially vulnerable, while real exchange rates

in the other six countries were not significantly different from those in 1991 or had depreciated in real terms.

_The current account_

!e role of current account imbalances in provoking financial crises appears in numerous models such as

Dornbusch et al. (1995), Mishkin (1996), Roubini and Wachtel (1998) and Sachs et al. (1996). Lawrence

Summers presciently noted in _Te Economist_ (23 December 1996) that 'close attention should be paid to any

current account deficit in excess of 5% of GDP, particularly if it is financed in a way that could lead to rapid

reversals'. It is noticeable that a number of Asian economies were becoming more vulnerable in this regard, as

shown in Table 17.4.

!e table shows that many of the countries were experiencing large or deteriorating current account deficits

as a percentage of their GDP in the 1990s and in the run-up to the crisis in 1997. !is was especially the case for

!ailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Korea. In the case of !ailand it was running at an unsustainable rate

- f over 8% of GDP a year in 1995 and 6.7% in 1996. In the case of Hong Kong large surpluses were being run
up until 1994 but therea(er there was a significant deterioration. Nonetheless, the picture is far from uniform;
for example, Singapore had large surpluses which actually steadily increased in the 1990s, and likewise Taiwan
also remained in surplus throughout the 1990s. To some extent, given the high economic growth rates, some

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

weakness in the current account was to be expected. Interestingly, what may have been more significant as an

early-warning signal was that the deterioration in the current accounts in the immediate run-up to the crisis

from 1994 to 1996 coincided with a slowdown in economic growth rates over that period (with the notable

exception of Malaysia). As we shall see later, there was some weak linkage between the size of the current

account deficit and the fall in the nominal exchange rate that subsequently occurred.

Economics makes a distinction between current account deficits that on the one hand are due to domestic

investment being greater than domestic savings and on the other hand are due to government expenditures

exceeding government tax revenues. Generally speaking, where a current account deficit is caused by high

domestic investment then it is usually regarded as less worrying than in the case where it is caused by

low savings, which is suggestive of a consumption boom. One has to be careful, however, because even if

investment is higher than domestic savings, this investment needs to be productive. Also it needs to give a

su'cient boost to the traded sector to improve the future current account performance of the economy. To

the extent that the investment is directed to the non-traded sector, for example the property sector, then it may

not help to improve the current account in the longer run. It is instructive to look at the government finances

and the private-sector balances in this regard; Table 17.5 shows the government fiscal balances as a percentage

- f GDP and Table 17.6 shows the excess of private investment over private savings as a percentage of GDP.

From Table 17.5 it becomes apparent that it is very di'cult to argue that the cause of the crisis lay in the

pursuit of imprudent fiscal policies. Most governments were running fiscal surpluses and only in Taiwan was

the size of the fiscal deficit significant, and even then it was actually being reduced in the run-up to the crisis.

Hence, _prima facie_, the evidence suggests that there was not a significant fiscal root to the crisis. However, one

has to be careful; in an in$uential paper, Burnside et al. (2001) argue that the size of fiscal deficits/surpluses

masked the potential dangers to public debt levels of implicit bailout guarantees.

What is more apparent from Table 17.6 is that in many of the economies there was an excess of private

investment over private savings, which ominously widened prior to the crisis. Only in Singapore was there

a persistent large excess of private savings over private investment. Hence, the net capital in$ows into the

Asian economies were driven primarily by the fact that private investment was exceeding private savings in

the region.

It is also worthwhile considering whether the exceptionally high rates of investment throughout the 1990s

- f over 30% of GDP in most of these countries were sustainable – even in the case of the Philippines and
Taiwan the rates were in the 20–25% range. Although the o'cial figures may overstate actual investment
by including in certain instances elements of consumption, there is some evidence presented by Corsetti
et al. (1998) that such investment was beginning to become less productive in the run-up to the economic
crisis (1993–96) compared to the earlier period (1987–93). In the case of Korea, some 20 of the 30 largest
conglomerates had rates of return on capital below their costs of capital, and seven of them were close to
bankrupt. Indeed, in Korea the 1996 debt/equity ratio of the top 30 _chaebols_ was estimated to be in excess of
300% in the run-up to the crisis, with some of them having debt/equity ratios as high as 3,000%.

Table 17.7 shows some interesting data concerning capital $ows into the Asian region in the run-up to

and during the crisis. !ere were high net capital in$ows into the region right up until the crisis broke in

mid-1997. It is important to note that many of the capital in$ows were of a short-term nature, but by the end

- f 1996 the share of short-term debt to total debt was typically above 50% in the region. Indeed, the ratio
- f short-term liabilities to foreign exchange reserves was above 100% in the cases of Korea, !ailand and
Indonesia. It was the sudden and dramatic reversal of these $ows that lay at the root of the crisis that then
ensued. Our analysis of the macro-fundamentals suggests that a sudden reversal could not have been easily
predicted from the macrodata, and we thus need to investigate in more detail the background to the crisis and
make some attempt to account for the sudden withdrawal of foreign capital.

17.7 THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL FACTORS IN THE CRISIS

!ere can be little doubt that a number of external factors also played an important background role to the

economic crisis:

1. Following the collapse of its property and stock market bubbles at the end of the 1980s, Japan

spent most of the 1990s in economic recession. Interest rates were kept at very low levels and this

encouraged a capital out$ow from Japan into the South East Asian economies, enabling them to

finance excessive investment projects with relative ease.

2. Some argue that a loss in the cost-competitiveness of the Asian economies can be traced back to a

50% devaluation of the Chinese renminbi in 1994. However, this has been disputed by authors such

as Edison et al. (1999) who argue that many business transactions were carried out at the new parity

long before the actual devaluation occurred.

3. Financial deregulation had attracted large foreign banks to invest heavily in the region. International

banks believed that their loans were effectively underpinned by the governments in the region, thus

leading to a moral hazard problem. !e belief that loans were guaranteed either by the governments

    - r by the potential for IMF bailout packages may have contributed to a climate of excessive lending

that ultimately made a crisis more likely to occur than if the perceived insurance schemes had not

been in place.

4. In April 1997 the Japanese government imposed a consumption tax that is widely credited with

leading to an abrupt decline in consumer expenditure in Japan. !is in turn had a noticeable impact

    - n the exports of its Asian trading partners. !e tax was also widely credited with stalling Japan’s

fragile economic recovery.

From mid-1995 onwards there was a sharp effective appreciation of the US dollar in relation

to the Japanese and European currencies, which led to a deterioration in the competitiveness

    - f those Asian)economies that had pegged their currencies to the US dollar. Given the lags

between)exchange)rate effects and trade this began to impact upon their export performance

in)1996/97.

A combination of the above factors meant that the Asian economies were vulnerable to changes in market

sentiment. Before we proceed to examine the factors that were of more immediate concern in causing this

change in sentiment we need to examine the crucial role of the financial sector in the crisis. In particular, we

need to examine the linkage between the capital $ows outlined in Table 17.7 and the expansion of domestic

credit that fuelled the stock market and property boom in the region in the run-up to the crisis.

17.8 THE ROLE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

!e role of the banking system in financial crises in emerging economies has been noted in a number of

studies such as Kaminsky and Reinhart (1996) and Goldfajn and Rodrigo (1997). !e occurrence of financial

crises has o(en occurred with a lag following a period of financial liberalization. For instance, Jeffrey Sachs in

the _Financial Times_ (18 September 1997) has argued that:

!roughout … South East Asia banks have been deregulated and privatized in recent years, allowing

them much greater latitude to borrow from abroad. Banks and near-banks such as !ailand's now

notorious financial trusts – become intermediaries for channelling foreign capital into the domestic

economy. !e trouble is that the newly liberalized banks and near-banks o(en operate under highly

distorted incentives. Under-capitalized banks have incentives to borrow abroad and invest domestically

with reckless abandon. If the lending works out, the bankers make money. If the lending fails, the

depositors and creditors stand to lose money, but the bank owners bear little risk themselves because

they have little capital tied up in the bank. Even the depositors and the foreign creditors may be secure

from risk, if the government bails them out in the case of bank failure.

!e pivotal role of the banking system and its relationship with the government and the corporate structure in the

East Asian crisis is perhaps far more important to an understanding of the economic crisis than any deterioration

in the macroeconomic fundamentals. !e governments in the South East Asian economies had tried to foster

high rates of economic growth and they applied political pressure on domestic banks to lend to corporations and

- n the corporations themselves to undertake heavy investment programmes to achieve this. To induce firms to
undertake such investment programmes governments provided direct subsidies, tax concessions and in many
cases public guarantees. More importantly, state-run banks were directed to extend credit to corporations largely
without a proper evaluation of the risk–return nature of the investment being undertaken. !e domestic banks

- btained easy finance from a mixture of domestic residents and from foreign banks and investors who thought
that their loans were effectively guaranteed by the governments of the South East Asian economies.

It is also important to appreciate in this context that the Asian banking system suffered from many

weaknesses (see Mishkin, 1999), including lax supervision, weak regulation, insu'cient skills in the

regulatory bodies, low capital adequacy ratios, poor project selection schemes and even corruption in lending

practices. !e banks used inadequate credit-scoring mechanisms and were subject to political manipulation

in their lending criteria, resulting in credit being extended to firms without any proper regard to profitability.

!is resulted in non-performing loans (NPLs) taking up an ever-increasing proportion of their loan book. In

addition, governments were heavily enmeshed in the corporate culture with political favouritism, a history of

government 'bailouts' of failing firms and little real concern for profitability. !is severe structural weakness

in the Asian banking systems meant that the foreign capital in$ows were not e'ciently intermediated.

Given the generally underdeveloped nature of the bond and equity markets in the South East Asian

countries, the banks have a very significant role in the Asian financial systems. For example, in Indonesia

the banks were responsible for around two-thirds of corporate finance, while the stock market provided only

a third in the run-up to the crisis. Most capital in$ows were therefore intermediated one way or another by

local banks. It was when the loans intermediated by local banks and financial houses started to become nonperforming that foreign investors became eager to pull their money out of the region. As Table 17.8 shows,

NPLs were particularly high in the countries most heavily affected by the crisis, namely Indonesia, Malaysia,

Korea and !ailand.

One of the major impetuses for the foreign capital in$ows into Asia was the financial liberalization that

took place in the 1990s. !e $ows of capital were also encouraged by fixing exchange rate parities vis-à-vis

the US dollar, which lowered the perceived exchange risk premium on investment in these countries. It seems

that international banks believed that, should their lending go sour, they would either be bailed out by the

local government or obtain an indirect bailout through IMF involvement in the event of any problems in

the region. Such beliefs were to some extent fostered by declarations, such as those made by the Indonesian

Finance Ministry which announced in 1994 that it would not permit a state bank to default and that the

government supported 'forced' mergers in instances where a private bank was in trouble. McKinnon and

Pill (1996) argue that international banks in the run-up to the crisis had lent huge amounts of funds to the

region's domestic banks with little regard to any detailed risk-assessment. Evidence of a lending boom fuelled

by foreign capital in$ows is documented in Corsetti et al. (1998), and Table 17.9 shows a significant upward

movement in bank lending to the private sector in all of the countries studied.

In all the countries under study we can see that there was a significant increase in bank lending to the

private sector as a percentage of GDP, and the fact that GDP was rising strongly in this period must also be

borne in mind. In the three countries where the lending boom was the greatest – namely the Philippines,

!ailand and Malaysia – it is noteworthy that these were the countries most hard hit by the crisis in 1997.

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

in all of the economies during the period 1991 to 1996, which seems to have started to come to an end in

1997. !e concentration of foreign loans to the property sector and the financing of speculation in the equity

markets meant the banking systems were particularly vulnerable to any asset de$ation.

!at there was an asset and property bubble in these economies cannot be easily refuted – see for example

Sarno and Taylor (1999). !e Hong Kong market quadrupled in 1990–96, the !ai and Philippines markets

rose by over 240% and speculation drove property and land values to unsustainable levels.

17.9 THE IMMEDIATE CAUSES OF THE CRISIS

It is not completely clear what was the spark that ignited the crisis. !e first major corporate failure took

place in Korea in January 1997, when Hanbo Steel collapsed under the weight of \$6 billion of debts; it

was soon followed by Sammi Steel and Kia Motors. !e collapse of these companies meant problems for

the local merchant banks that had either borrowed significantly from foreign banks to finance lending to

these companies or who had provided guarantees to foreign investors that had made direct loans to the

companies.

Pressure on the !ai baht had begun to emerge at the back end of 1996, fostered by concern about its large

current account deficit and increasing reliance on short-term foreign capital. In addition the !ai stock market

had begun a steep decline as early as February 1996: the market fell over 30% in 1996 and a further 30% by

mid-1997. !e Korean market fell 26% in 1996 and the Malaysian market began to decline in February 1996,

but other markets did not show any sign of weakness right up to July/August 1997 (see Table 17.11). Pressure

had been mounting on the !ai baht as early as July 1996 when, following the collapse of the Bangkok Bank of

Commerce, there had been a large injection of liquidity into the financial system by the Bank of !ailand. In

February 1997, Samprasong Land (a !ai property company) missed debt payments due to foreign creditors

and in so doing signalled the start of a collapse in the local property market and serious trouble for local

finance companies with heavy loan exposure to property companies. While the Bank of !ailand committed

some \$8 billion of loans to assist financial institutions facing di'culty, this proved insu'cient to deal with

the magnitude of the debts. !e pressures on the financial system continued through to 14 May 1997, when

the !ai stock market fell nearly 7%, and on 19 June, following the resignation of the Finance Minister, a

staunch supporter of the currency peg, the stock market fell nearly 11% in a single day. In a bid to save the

!ai baht from devaluation the Bank of !ailand engaged in substantial forward purchases of the currency,

representing a massive drain on its foreign exchange reserves. !e battle to save the baht from devaluation

ultimately proved unsuccessful when, following the withdrawal of support from the !ai authorities, Finance

One (a major finance company) announced that it would not be able to meet payments to foreign or domestic

creditors. !is announcement came as a major shock to foreign creditors and led to such a massive withdrawal

- f funds that the baht was forced to devalue on 2 July 1997.

!e !ai devaluation then seems to have triggered international investors' concerns about the entire

region. A successful speculative attack was launched against the Philippines peso which was forced to $oat

- n 11 July. !e crisis soon spread to Malaysia where the property sector had been experiencing a speculative
bubble. Local banks had lent significant sums of money to fuel speculative equity and real-estate investments
and the party started to come to an end in March 1997 when the central bank announced restrictions on
lending for real estate and property purposes. !e announcement came as a shock to foreign investors and led
to a sharp drop in the Malaysian Stock Exchange which had a heavy weighting to the property and financial
sector. !e speculative pressure against the ringgit came to a crescendo following the Philippine devaluation,
which was forced to $oat on 14 July. !e Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed launched a vitriolic

461

International Finance

attack against 'rogue speculators' and introduced controls on capital out$ows and against the short-selling of

equities and the ringgit in the forward exchange market.

!e contagion element of the crisis is perhaps best illustrated by the case of Indonesia. Although Indonesia

had many weaknesses such as a poorly regulated financial system, 'crony capitalism' characterized by political

nepotism and a persistent current account deficit, things were not that bad. Indonesia had avoided any major

corporate bankruptcies, the government had been running fiscal surpluses and the exposure of the commercial

banking system to foreign creditors at around 6% of GDP was well below that of other countries in the region,

although corporate debts to foreign creditors were fairly significant. Despite this, the rupiah came under intense

speculative pressure and was forced to $oat on 14 August 1997. !e resulting depreciation, combined with a

rise in interest rates designed to protect the currency, resulted in Indonesia being dragged into the crisis, and

September to December saw a plunge into a severe crisis situation. Although a letter of intent was signed with the

IMF on 31 October that secured a \$40 billion support package it had little impact on the crisis, and in November

the Indonesian stock market fell some 20%. !e illness of President Suharto in December only added to the

crisis atmosphere and by the beginning of 1998 Indonesia had become the investment pariah of the region.

Political instability in the region also played a background role in the crisis: there were major cabinet

reshu%es in !ailand; the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed attacked 'rogue speculators'; and

elections in Indonesia, combined with the ill-health of its President Suharto and his unpredictable policies,

combined with presidential elections in Korea, all added to the sense of political and economic instability in

the region.

In November 1997 the Hong Kong dollar came under intense speculative attack, since speculators felt its

peg to the US dollar was no longer sustainable given the other devaluations that had occurred within the

region. !erea(er, for the best part of a year it seems that there was a continual battle between the Hong

Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and speculators over the sustainability of the Hong Kong dollar peg.

Speculators simultaneously shorted the Hang Seng index and sold the Hong Kong dollar forward. !e bet

proved very lucrative for the speculators since the HKMA was forced to raise interest rates to defend the

Hong Kong dollar parity, which depressed the Hong Kong property and stock market. !e battle between the

speculators and the HKMA was only finally resolved in October 1998 when the HKMA started to buy shares

to boost the Hang Seng index.

By November 1997 South Korea had been dragged into the crisis and speculative attacks were launched

against the Korean won, and even a Korean rescue package with the IMF announced on 21 November failed

to end the speculative pressure, as the terms of the deal which included tax rises and spending cuts were

viewed by the markets as likely to worsen the plight of the economy. Rumours also surfaced in December that

Korea would declare a debt moratorium and on 11 December the Korean markets suffered significant declines

following a Moody's downgrade of its foreign-currency-denominated bonds. For a while Japan also became

a subject of concern following the closure on 24 November of the fourth-largest securities house Yamaichi

Securities, and on 19 December foodstuff trader Toshoku filed for bankruptcy, leading to concerns that more

would follow. Indonesia added to the sense of panic by reneging on promised structural reforms.

By mid-January 1998, somewhat calmer markets returned as a result of the news that international banks

had agreed to roll-over much of Korea's short-term debt, and on 19 January Indonesia's agreement to a tough

IMF package was also welcomed. However, once again the calm was short-lived as Indonesia started to $irt

with the idea of introducing a currency board and the IMF made it clear that it was not going to support

Indonesian plans to peg the rupiah to the dollar. From February up until the end of May, markets did not stage

a comeback nor did they collapse, rallying somewhat on the announcement of trade surpluses in !ailand (13

March) and tumbling on news of unrest and looting in Indonesia, which eventually led to the resignation of

President Suharto in May 1998.

462

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

17.10 AN ANALYSIS OF THE CRISIS

Mishkin (1999) argues that the weak position of the Asian banking system with regard to the increasing

percentage of non-performing loans (NPLs), when combined with their fixed exchange rate systems, made

speculative attacks far more likely to succeed. When banks' balance sheets are weak, speculators know that

central banks' attempts to defend the currency via interest rate hikes are likely to fail since they increase

the percentage of NPLs and weaken still further the banks' balance sheets, eventually making devaluation

inevitable. In 1996 it has been estimated that NPLs as a proportion of total lending was 8% in Korea, 13% in

Indonesia, 10% in Malaysia, 14% in the Philippines, 13% in !ailand and 4% each in Singapore and Taiwan,

and 3% in Hong Kong. Exposure to the property market was particularly high in Hong Kong, Malaysia,

Singapore and !ailand, whilst in Korea and Indonesia most of the bank exposure was to manufacturing

companies. For instance, in 1996 the Malaysian banking system's exposure to the property and equity sector

was some 42.6%, while exposure to the manufacturing sector was around 21%. Once the crisis got under way

it had a dramatic impact on the proportion of NPLs, which reached an estimated high of over 30% in Korea

and !ailand at the peak of the crisis.

Once devaluations and drops in property prices and stock markets got under way in the region, the crisis

took on a life of its own. !e devaluations meant large foreign exchange losses for domestic banks and firms

whose liabilities to foreign banks were largely unhedged since they had believed in their government's pledges

to maintain fixed exchange rates. !e drop in property and equity prices also caused substantial losses and

- utright defaults by many property companies and those playing the markets with margin accounts. In
summary, local banks were hit simultaneously on many fronts – the withdrawal of foreign funds, substantial
foreign exchange losses, a sharp rise in the percentage of non-performing loans and losses on equity holdings.
!e resulting rapid rise in the proportion of non-performing loans further accelerated the withdrawal of
foreign funds, which in turn led to further falls in the local currencies, property sector prices and stock
markets, so completing the vicious circle. !e erosion of the banking system's capital bases due to all of these
factors severely constrained their ability to lend to even solvent companies in the midst of the crisis.

!e withdrawal of foreign capital also meant a severe liquidity crisis. !e liquidity squeeze forced up local

interest rates which meant that local firms had considerable di'culty in obtaining finance just when they

needed it to cover their foreign exchange losses and service higher debt payments. !e rise in NPLs of the

local banking systems made foreign banks even more reluctant to roll-over any loans. !ere can be little doubt

that this reluctance was reinforced by the absence of any effective local bankruptcy laws and concerns that

local lenders would receive preferential treatment as compared to foreign creditors.

It is also apparent there was very little discrimination made between the various countries in the region as

international banks and foreign investors (including mutual funds) decided _en masse_ to pull funds out of the

region. !e crisis was thus characterized by contagion and herding behaviour on the part of foreign investors

and banks, and there were many ways in which the so-called contagion effect came into play during the Asian

crisis. As we have mentioned in section 17.4, when one currency was devalued it raised questions about the

sustainability and credibility of other fixed parities within the region. !e competitive advantage conferred to

the devaluing country also raised the prospect of a slowdown in the export growth of competitor countries, so

calling into question other exchange rate pegs. Similarly, as capital was pulled out of one country, so forcing it

to raise its interest rate, this had the effect of forcing up the interest rates in competing countries. When local

companies get into di'culty it is generally the case that domestic banks recall loans lent to foreign businesses

in the region first, so spreading the credit squeeze across borders. Furthermore, a downturn in the local

economy directly impacts on the exports of other countries in the region.

463

International Finance

!ere also seems to have been a problem of imperfect information: foreign investors faced with insu'cient

information were unable to distinguish the bad from the not so bad countries and so reacted in a fairly

uniform manner by removing capital from all of them. !e role of speculators, including hedge funds, in

foreign exchange crises cannot be underestimated: having made a great deal of money by successfully betting

against the !ai baht it was only natural for speculators to switch their attention to testing the sustainability

- f other currency pegs in the region.

It is important to understand that it was not just US and European banks that scaled back their lending to

the region. In particular, Japanese banks, who were facing further erosion to their already weak capital bases

as a result of losses from their Asian exposure, decided to call in many of their loans to the region. Similarly,

Korean banks that were faced with extensive problems due to their exposure to the heavily indebted _chaebols_

started to call in loans they had extended to the rest of Asia. !e attempt by speculators to force a devaluation

- f the Hong Kong dollar led to the raising of interest rates by the HKMA, and apart from placing pressure
- n the already beleaguered Hong Kong stock market and property sector by raising the interest payable on
deposits, some Hong Kong banks were forced to recall loans they had made to the rest of Asia.

In retrospect, there were also policy errors conducted by the local governments that probably exacerbated

the crisis. For example, the !ai authorities might have been better off allowing the baht to $oat freely rather

than exhausting their foreign exchange reserves trying to defend the parity. Both the !ai and Korean

authorities initially spent huge amounts of money trying to keep a$oat companies that were clearly headed

for liquidation. In the case of !ailand the authorities' refusal in late June 1997 to save Finance One, contrary

to previous promises, brought into question the credibility of all their other guarantees. Indeed, it can be

plausibly argued that the reneging on the commitment to save Finance One was the crucial match that ignited

the Asian crisis. !e existence of 'crony capitalism' was seen to be in play in Indonesia where IMF and state

funds were directed at trying to save the business interests of President Suharto's relatives. !e early imposition

in August 1997 by the Malaysian and !ai authorities of foreign exchange controls once the crisis began only

heightened the desire of foreign investors to get out of the region and probably contributed to subsequent

downgrades by the credit-rating agencies.

!e currencies that fell most during the crisis (Table 17.12) were those of countries with the largest currentaccount deficits. !e Hong Kong dollar parity was successfully defended by the HKMA against speculative

attacks throughout the crisis. Most noticeably, the two surplus countries, Singapore and Taiwan, witnessed

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

their currencies fall by relatively modest amounts of around 20%; indeed, during the crisis the decline of the

last two currencies was far more orderly. Hence, there is some evidence that there was a link between current

accounts and the exchange rate turmoil.

17.11 THE IMF HANDLING OF THE CRISIS

Once the crisis was under way economic agents were generally very keen to exit the region and the initial IMF

plans were signed but not adhered to by the governments. !is was particularly the case in Indonesia where

the Suharto regime ignored virtually all of its commitments and only reversed policy once the rupiah went

into freefall. Likewise, initially, the IMF package for Korea was only grudgingly accepted, and in !ailand it

was only the onset of a new government that was committed to economic reform that finally stabilized the

baht. !e overall IMF programme to the region had a number of objectives:

1. Prevention of default on the part of the Asian countries;
2. Prevention of a freefall in their exchange rates;
3. Prevention of the emergence of in$ation;
Maintenance of sound fiscal discipline;
Restoration of investor confidence in the region;
Structural reform of the financial sector and banking system;

7. Structural reform of the corporate sector, in particular the ending of so-called 'crony capitalism';
8. Rebuilding of foreign exchange reserves;
9. Limiting the decline of output.

!e key instruments used by the IMF to achieve these objectives were:

 - **Bank closures.** !e IMF was very keen to ensure that the least-viable banks were closed down. !ose
banks that remained open were expected to restore their capital ratios to above the 8% required by
the Basle Accord. In !ailand some 58 out of 91 finance companies were suspended, of which over
55 were eventually liquidated. In its agreement with the IMF the !ai banks were expected to have
a capital adequacy ratio of 10% by the end of 1997 and 12% by 2001. Similarly, in Korea 14 out of 30
merchant banks were suspended in a move designed to restore confidence in the banking system. In
the case of Indonesia the IMF insisted on the closure of some 16 banks. !e IMF policy focused on
closing down the banks with the highest proportion of non-performing loans.

 - **Fiscal discipline.** !e IMF regarded the maintenance of fiscal discipline as crucial to the successful
management of the crisis. In its programme for !ailand it stated that 'fiscal policy is the key to the

	- verall credibility of the programme'. In its initial packages it required that the Asian economies
actually run budget surpluses equivalent to 1% of GDP. !e IMF viewed the maintenance of fiscal
discipline as crucial since government funds would be needed to assist in the eventual recapitalization

	- f the banking systems, restoring foreign confidence and helping to improve the balance of payments
position of the deficit countries.

 - **Monetary discipline.** As is typical of IMF packages, limits were set on the creation of domestic credit,
and interest rates were raised in an attempt to reduce capital out$ows and relieve pressures on the

465

International Finance

currencies. !e IMF recognized that the higher interest rates would harm the corporate sector in the

economies but judged that the benefits from exchange rate stability would more than offset this. For

instance, the Deputy Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki on 30 January 1998 stated:

We know that higher interest rates are likely to hurt the corporate sector, but an appreciation

     - f the currency that follows a tightening of monetary conditions would greatly benefit those

corporations indebted in foreign currency. !ere is no alternative in the short term. A relaxation

     - f monetary policy would only lead to further depreciations of the currencies.

 - **Structural reform of the banking and corporate sector.** While IMF programmes are usually
concentrated on ensuring the pursuit of fiscal and monetary restraint on the part of the crisis country,
they are usually limited with regard to financial sector and corporate reform. However, in the Asian
crisis this was not the case; the IMF believed that in the longer term there was a need to reform the
banking and corporate structure in the Asian economies by a more radical policy of restructuring and
liberalization, which involved the closing of numerous banks, reducing tariffs, reducing state aid and
the opening-up of the region to foreign direct investment in the economies. As Michel Camdessus,
the Managing Director of the IMF, emphasized:

In view of the nature of the crisis, these programmes had to go far beyond addressing the major

fiscal, monetary or external balances. !eir aim is to strengthen financial systems, improve

governance and transparency, restore economic competitiveness, and modernize the legal and

regulatory environment.

17.12 AN EVALUATION OF THE IMF PROGRAMMES

Authors such as Radlett and Sachs (1998) have criticized the IMF programmes as being unduly harsh and

indeed exacerbating the crisis, the policy on bank closures coming in for particular criticism. !ey argue

that the requirements to close many of the banks added to the credit squeeze on the private sector, created a

sense of panic on the part of international investors and led to a series of bank runs as local residents sought

to safeguard their savings. For instance, by the end of November 1997 two-thirds of Indonesian banks had

suffered a run on their deposits. !e policy of recapitalization is also harshly criticized by Radlett and Sachs:

they argue that the raising of capital adequacy ratios greatly and unnecessarily added to the credit crunch on

the corporate sector. However, in the IMF's defence it regarded structural reform as absolutely essential since

problems in the banking sector lay at the heart of the crisis. !e IMF also believed that without structural

reform, the chance of restoring foreign confidence and capital $ows back to the region would remain low.

Moreover, the major bank runs that had occurred in Indonesia were not repeated on anything like the same

scale in !ailand and Korea.

!e fiscal and monetary programmes have also come in for quite a lot of criticism, most notably from the

Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz (2002), who argued that the tough fiscal discipline combined

with higher interest rates meant that the contraction in economic output was greater than would otherwise

have been the case. As we have seen, at the time of the crisis, the Asian economies were actually running

fiscal surpluses or relatively small deficits and their national debt to GDP ratios were also not excessively

high. However, as noted previously the IMF believed that fiscal restraint was essential, partly as a corrective

mechanism for helping the current account to return to surplus and partly as a means of preventing further

466

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

wastage of scarce government resources on low marginal return projects. !e containment of government

expenditure was regarded as particularly important, given that public funds would be needed to recapitalize

and restructure the banking systems.

On the monetary front the rise in interest rates which should in theory have helped strengthen the

currencies did not succeed in doing so. !e currencies in fact depreciated even more heavily following the

initial IMF packages, despite the steep rise in interest rates and the exchange rate targets set. It appears to be

the case that the squeeze on local companies and the increase in non-performing loans on the books of the

banking system probably added to the sense of crisis and may have further exacerbated the withdrawal of

foreign capital. However, this argument is not as clear-cut as it seems: if the countries had not raised their

interest rates, it may well have been the case that their currencies would have depreciated even more than they

did, which would have exacerbated the losses for domestic banks and companies that had unhedged foreign

currency debts. Furthermore, larger falls in the currencies of the region could well have led to hyperin$ation

and even more disruption to economic activity than actually occurred.

While there is no doubt that the initial IMF policy programmes were quite tough, the policies became

somewhat so(er as the extent of the economic downturn in the Asian economies became evident. For example,

the original Indonesian package negotiated in October 1997 required Indonesia to run budget surpluses

equivalent to 1% of GDP in the fiscal years 1997/98 and 1998/99, but a subsequent agreement reached in June

1998 permitted a budget deficit of up to 8.5% of GDP.

!e moral hazard problem is a recurrent theme with respect to IMF interventions, the argument being that

IMF bailouts actually make crises more likely than if it did not intervene. However, this argument should clearly

not be taken too far, since in most economic crises investors are probably not expecting an IMF intervention

when investing their funds. Indeed, most investors would probably be very reluctant to lend funds if they felt

that there was a reasonable chance that the country might need to seek emergency assistance from the Fund

in the near future. Furthermore, during crises most investors do end up losing substantially – in the Asian

crisis it is estimated that foreign investors in the bond and equity markets in the affected countries lost in the

region of 50–80% of their capital as the value of their investments in the region plummeted. In addition, the

idea that governments will be more inclined to pursue imprudent policies knowing that the IMF will likely

come to the rescue cannot be taken too seriously. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most governments are

extremely reluctant to go to the IMF as it is taken as a clear sign of economic policy failure and usually results

in the government falling or failing to get re-elected. It is also important to bear in mind here that if there was

no IMF to act as a lender of last resort, then there would be a significant danger of even greater panic. !e IMF

programmes and loans also act as an institutional buffer to limit potential contagion effects. In the absence

- f the IMF the risk of even greater regional dislocations, disorderly markets and possibly a more significant
global financial crisis has to be considered.

17.13 THE CRISIS AND POST-CRISIS PERFORMANCE OF THE ECONOMIES

As can be seen in Table 17.1 there were very significant falls in economic output in many of the crisis-hit

countries during 1998, with real GDP falling by 13.1% in Indonesia, 10.5% in !ailand, 7.4% in Malaysia and

6.9% in Korea. !ese output falls were dramatic, especially as these economies had been used to growing at the

rate of 5–8% per year. However, fortunately, the slump in economic activity proved to be relatively short-lived

and during 1999 and 2000 the economies rebounded strongly, although their growth rates during the first few

years of the new century were generally significantly lower than in the early 1990s. What is also clear from

Table 17.4 is that there was a dramatic improvement in their current accounts during 1998, though this was

467

International Finance

driven primarily by a massive fall in imports induced by the dramatic fall in output in the a%icted economies

and the effects of the large exchange rate depreciations which encouraged exports and made imports more

expensive. In general it seems that the real depreciations of the effective exchange rates that occurred in all the

economies since 1997 led to an improved current account position in all the economies post-1997, compared

to the current account deficits in the run-up to the crisis.

!e fiscal situation, however, seems to have undergone a significant deterioration as shown in Table 17.5:

fiscal surpluses of the early to mid-1990s were replaced by fiscal deficits in most of the economies. !ese

fiscal deficits have come about partly because of the costs of the crisis itself in terms of the bailouts of some

- f the financial institutions and companies, repayment of loans to international institutions, the increased
unemployment and also the slower economic growth rates that the economies have experienced since the
crisis. In addition, the savings and investment data reported in Table 17.6 – which changed quite dramatically
during the crisis as savings rose and investment collapsed – seem to have undergone a marked change
compared to the pre-crisis era with savings rates generally higher and investment rates somewhat lower than
before the crisis.

In summary, the output effects of the crisis were quite dramatic but the recession itself, while sharp, was

relatively short-lived. !ere does, however, appear to have been a more significant change in some of the

crucial economic relationships in these economies, most noticeably the improved current account balances

and deterioration in the fiscal balances, meaning that private savings and investment relationships seem to

have undergone a quite significant change due to higher savings and lower investment rates than before the

crisis. !e depreciation of the real effective exchange rates of the economies made them significantly more

competitive in 2004 than in 1997.

17.14 EARLY-WARNING SYSTEMS

Given the number of currency and financial crises that have occurred in recent years, economists, policymakers and market participants have been keen for different reasons to develop early-warning systems (EWSs)

that may be useful in predicting the timing and probability of a financial crisis; Kaminsky et al. (1998) is one

- f the pioneering papers in this respect. !e aim of an early-warning system is to look at various economic
and financial indicators for signs prior to outbreak that a crisis is highly likely to occur in the near future (say
within 12–18 months). Ideally, of course, an EWS as well as detecting potential crises should avoid giving out
false signals, that is, predict a crisis when one does not in fact occur. An EWS would be useful for financial
market participants in that it would give them a chance to reduce their potential risk exposure (and of course
take speculative positions) and also provide useful information to policy markets who, forewarned of a crisis,
could be expected to take pre-emptive measures against an actual outbreak of a crisis.

!e Kaminsky et al. (1998) paper uses a 'signal' approach to devising an early-warning system. !is

involves looking at a selection of various economic and financial indicators that may exhibit unusual

behaviour prior to the outbreak of a crisis: each time an indicator exceeds a predetermined threshold a

signal is generated predicting a crisis. It is essential that the thresholds are not set too low or the EWS will

generate too many false signals, that is, predict a currency crisis when no crisis occurs. On the other hand,

the thresholds should not be set so high that too few signals are generated and the EWS fails to predict a

crisis when one actually occurs. !e aim of an EWS is to predict a currency crisis within one to two years

- f the actual crisis occurring. A signal can be considered useful on the basis of three alternative metrics: (1)
its probability of predicting a crisis (the higher its success rate the better), (2) the length of time in advance

- f a crisis that the prediction is made (the more in advance the better), and (3) the persistence with which it

468

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

predicts a crisis (the more o(en it warns of a crisis that actually occurs the better). !e following matrix can

be used to evaluate the usefulness of a variable in predicting a crisis:

|Col1|Crisis(within24months)|Nocrisis(within24months)|
|---|---|---|
|Signal was issued|_A_|_B_|
|No signal was issued|_C_|_D_|

where _A_ is the number of months in which the indicator predicts a crisis and a crisis subsequently occurs, _B_ is

the number of months the signal provides a false signal of a forthcoming crisis, _C_ is the number of months the

indicator fails to produce a signal and a crisis occurs, and _D_ is the number of months the indicator produces

no signal and no crisis occurs. A good indicator is one that has lots of _A_ and _D_ - bservations and relatively few

_C_ and _B_ - bservations. A useful measure is the ratio _A_ /( _A_ + _C_ ) which shows the number of good signals that

the indicator issued as a percentage of the total number of signals that it could have produced, since a good

indicator will have a relatively high percentage of predicting a crisis when one actually occurs.

In their paper, which is essentially empirical in nature, Kaminsky et al. look at a variety of potential

indicators of a currency crisis, informed partly by the literature on speculative attacks. For instance, the firstgeneration models predict that the level of the money supply relative to the level of foreign exchange reserves,

the size of fiscal deficits and also of current account deficits can provide useful early-warning signals, whilst

the second-generation models argue that deviations of output below trend, high levels of unemployment or

high levels of public debt may be useful indicators since they weaken the resolve of the authorities to defend

a fixed exchange rate parity. !e paper also reviews a large range of studies that have looked at numerous

currency crises covering both developed and developing countries, and at a huge range of potentially useful

indicators.

Kaminsky et al., in surveying the literature of currency crises, place variables into one of six categories:

(1) the external sector, (2) the financial sector, (3) the real sector, (4) public finances, (5) institutional and

structural variables, and (6) political variables. A variable is only considered to have some usefulness if the

ratio of false to good signals that it generates is below unity. In their empirical analysis, the authors find

that output levels, deviations of the real exchange rate from trend, banking crises indicators, exports, the

ratio of broad money supply to reserves, the in$ation rate and equity prices provide useful EWS signals.

More surprisingly, current account deficits, fiscal deficits and the differential in real interest rates between the

domestic and foreign economies do not provide useful signals for the EWS. !ey conclude that a good system

needs to consider a variety of economic and financial variables.

We should perhaps not expect too much from an EWS, since no two crises are exactly alike and the

economic, financial and political variables which provoke a crisis can vary greatly and interact with each other

in o(en unpredictable ways. Just as a butter$y $apping its wings can provoke a hurricane in another part of

the world in chaos theory, so too can a minor event provoke a full-grown speculative crisis which was largely

unforeseeable. In addition, Flood and Marion (1999) make the point that currency crises are in practice

largely unforeseen by market participants, because macroand financial fundamentals are not indicating an

impending crisis as seems to have been the case in Asia, hence an EWS based on such indicators is likely to

have only a limited success rate. As they put it, 'the more unpredictable the crises, the less likely they are to

be significantly correlated with the information variables selected as possible crises determinants. Moreover,

if the potential determinants of currency crises differ across countries and across time, panel regressions that

look for consistent patterns may perform poorly' (p. 18).

17.15 CONCLUSIONS

Our interpretation of the Asian financial crisis has been informed by a mixture of the three generations of

currency crisis models. !ere are, however, reasons to believe that none of these models alone is su'cient to

explain the crisis, although elements of each were to a greater or lesser extent present during the crisis. For

instance, the devaluation of many of the currencies was preceded by current account deficits and a depletion

- f the foreign exchange reserves of the Asian countries, which is a characteristic of the Krugman model,
though the necessary fiscal deficits in this model were not evident. It is probably fair to say that the secondgeneration models do somewhat better than the first-generation models at explaining the Asian financial
crisis. Indeed, Krugman (1999, pp. 8–9) has acknowledged as much: 'I hereby capitulate. I cannot see any way
to make sense of the contagion of 1997–1998 without supposing the existence of multiple equilibria'. Likewise,
Masson (1998, p. 6) states that 'the fact that the optimistic view about East Asian economies prevailed for
so long (in the face of some reports of banking sector problems), the rapidity of the change of view, and the
suddenness and severity of the resulting crises all argue in favour of the multiple equilibria story'. !ere is
also no doubt that there was an explosion of risky lending to the region prior to the crisis and many of the
foreign banks that lent to domestic banks and companies in the region felt that there were explicit or implicit
government guarantees on their loans which led to the 'moral hazard' problem that is a characteristic of
the third-generation models. While it can be disputed whether the bubbles in the local property and stock
markets were rational or irrational, the proposition that bubbles were present cannot be easily refuted. Finally,
the withdrawal of foreign capital when the crisis arrived was both sudden, disorderly and characterized by a
high degree of panic which is characteristic of the Sachs (1995) model.

We have argued that although there were signs of a deterioration in the macroeconomic fundamentals,

these were not of a su'ciently large order to explain the magnitude of the financial crisis that subsequently

erupted. Far more significant in explaining the crisis was the lax lending by the local banking systems, fuelled

by excessive speculative foreign capital in$ows to the region. Much of the foreign capital was used in either

unproductive investments or to fuel an unsustainable boom in asset prices, most notably in stock market and

property valuations. !e need to re-establish fair values for property and equity prices then triggered the crisis

by undermining the quality of the loan portfolio of the domestic banks. !e magnitude of the financial crisis

that followed can then also partly be explained in the context of contagion theory and herding behaviour,

particularly on the part of foreign banks and international investors exposed to the region. Some of the blame

for the magnitude of the crisis can also be apportioned to policy errors by the affected national governments

and the initial IMF response.

A central contention of this chapter is that the Asian financial crisis was predominantly caused by excessive

foreign-financed credit expansion which resulted in unsustainable asset bubbles rather than any significant

macroeconomic weaknesses in the Asian economies. !e resulting financial crisis would have been far less

severe if international investors had rolled over their loans and not all tried to exit simultaneously from the

region. Once this happened, a self-reinforcing crisis was set in motion. As Radlett and Sachs (1998, p. 2) put

it, 'a combination of panic on the part of the international investment community, policy mistakes at the onset

- f the crisis by Asian governments, and poorly designed international rescue programs have led to a much
deeper fall in (otherwise viable) output than was necessary or desirable'.

In the context of the recent crises it is worth bearing in mind that many of them have been regional in

nature. One can think of the Latin American debt crises of the 1980s, the ERM crisis of 1992–93 and the

East Asian financial crises of 1997–98. Research by Glick and Rose (1999) suggests that there may be good

reasons for crises to become regional in character. Firstly, the economies o(en compete with one another in

international trade so that a devaluation of one country's currency will give it a competitive advantage over

470

Currency Crises and the East Asian Financial Crisis

- ther countries,)and this may then mean speculators will target the other countries' currencies which have been
adversely affected by the initial devaluation. Secondly, devaluations are o(en followed by recessions which slow
down intra-regional trade and growth, making other currencies in the region ripe for speculative attack. !eir
empirical estimates show that trade linkages between the country that is initially subjected to a speculative
attack and its trading partners are a statistically significant explanatory variables in regional currency crises.
Nevertheless, there is mounting empirical evidence (see, for example Fratzcher, 2003) that financial linkages
between countries are perhaps more important in explaining contagion and regional currency crises.

A recurring theme in financial crises is that extensive dependence on foreign capital leaves a country

especially vulnerable since foreign banks are less likely to be willing to renew lines of credit in the event of

a crisis than domestic banks. !e question of whether the imposition of capital controls on the out$ow of

capital during a crisis can help to mitigate the crisis is very controversial. !e main argument in favour of

controls on the out$ow of capital is that it would enable the authorities to get away with a lower domestic

interest rate than would otherwise be the case, and limiting the sales of the domestic currency would help

restrict the depreciation of the local currency which in turn would restrict foreign exchange losses and the

risk of uncontrolled in$ation. Authors such as Krugman (1998b) have argued that China was largely able to

ride out the Asian crisis because the yuan was inconvertible. Economic theory gives little guidance on the

subject, since in a second-best world the addition of a further distortion such as capital controls may or may

not raise economic welfare. !ere are, of course, longer-term adverse consequences from deploying capital

controls, such as ine'ciency, the potential for a misallocation of capital and lower economic growth, but

it is not too clear that these outweigh the short-term benefits in times of economic crisis, especially when

many of the capital movements are driven by panic and contagion effects. However, even during a crisis the

imposition of capital controls may not always be beneficial. Once one country imposes capital controls this

can lead to foreign investors accelerating capital $ight from other countries before they too decide to impose

controls. Indeed, capital might be pulled out of otherwise sound emerging market economies so that the crisis

is amplified. Some commentators have suggested that the imposition of capital controls by Malaysia in August

1998 may have been a factor in spreading the Asian crisis to Latin America.

!e Asian crisis certainly did show that the speed and sequencing of capital account liberalization

is an important issue. Such liberalization, as had occurred in the region, needs to be done gradually and

be accompanied by strong supervision of the domestic banking system – and indeed the corporate sector

aimed at avoiding a build-up of excessive short-term foreign liabilities on the part of domestic banks and the

domestic corporate sector.

!e signs of financial and economic recovery that started in 1999 in the East Asian economies may be

taken as evidence that the 1997–98 financial crisis was an overreaction on the part of market participants.

!e speed and size of the recovery was partly achieved by a return of confidence induced by the adoption of

more realistic IMF programmes and a recognition by market participants that the deterioration in economic

fundamentals was not of a su'cient magnitude to warrant the fall in currency and asset prices that actually

- occurred. Indeed, with the benefit of hindsight the exaggerated currency depreciations and falls in equity
markets created an excellent buying opportunity for foreign investors seeking to gain exposure to the region.

18.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter you will learn about: financial innovations such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)

and credit default swaps (CDSs), the causes of the credit crunch, the failure of Lehman Brothers and AIG,

the financial cost of the credit crunch, the measures taken by the authorities in response to the crisis and the

policy lessons and implications of the credit crunch. In addition, we look at the impact of the Covid-19 global

health and economic crisis and the policy response.

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

A number of financial innovations have been developed since the 1990s through to the present. !ese new

financial instruments such as collateralized debt obligations and credit derivatives including credit default

swaps played a significant role in the so-called credit crunch which is generally considered to have started

- n 9)August 2007. On that date BNP Paribas warned investors that they would not be able to withdraw
money from two of its funds due to a 'complete evaporation of liquidity' in the market. In addition, the
European Central Bank pumped &95 billion of liquidity into the markets, followed a few days later by a further
&108.7 billion. Up until the outbreak of the credit crunch financial innovation had generally been viewed as a
good thing for financial markets and the economy. It was believed that risk could be divided up into various
tranches and transferred from market participants wishing to reduce their risk exposure to other participants
prepared to take on greater risk exposure. However, the credit crunch showed that rather than reduce risk
exposure, much of the financial innovation had in fact built up the level of risk to such a high level that there
was a major breakdown in the banking and financial systems. In April 2009, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) estimated that there would be close to \$4.1 trillion of losses in financial institutions worldwide. !e
scale of the financial crisis was unprecedented in modern times and comparisons were made with the global
depression of the 1930s.

!e chapter begins with a look at two of the key financial instruments linked to the credit crisis,

(i))collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and (ii) credit derivatives with a particular emphasis on credit

default swaps (CDSs). As we shall see, these two financial securities played a pivotal role in the crisis, so an

understanding of these instruments is essential to understanding how the credit crunch impacted so heavily

upon the banking sector and, in the case of CDSs, was directly related to the failure of American International

Group (AIG). Prior to the outbreak of the crisis AIG was the world's largest insurance firm, but it had to be

bailed out to the tune of approximately \$180 billion by the US taxpayer in September 2008. We then proceed to

look at the credit crunch, analysing the role played by the financial innovations and the responsibilities of the

different players involved in the crisis. !ese players include individuals such as the former chairman of the

Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, heads of banks and financial companies such as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae

and Citigroup, and organizations including financial regulators such as the Securities Exchange Commission

(SEC) and the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the rating agencies, governments, financial institutions,

and ultimately households and companies that took on unserviceable debt levels.

18.2 FINANCIAL INNOVATION: COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS

In this section we look at some of the key financial innovations that played a significant role in laying the

foundations for the credit crunch. As we shall see, to some extent these financial innovations were linked

to each other during the financial crisis. In theory each of these instruments has clear benefits in helping to

manage risk and transfer it to those willing to take on the risk. In practice, however, they did not work as well

as they should have. In large part the failure lay in the fact that CDOs and other structured finance products

were 'misunderstood, mis rated, mis-sold and mispriced'.

_Collateralized debt obligations_

A **collateralized debt obligation** (CDO) is a security that bundles together a range of different debt obligations

and/or a package of bank loans into a financial security that is divided up into various tranches, with each

tranche having different risk and return characteristics. !e best way to illustrate a CDO is via a simple example.

473

International Finance

Example of a CDO

Imagine that a series of mortgage loans equivalent to \$500 million has been made to various borrowers. Some

- f these borrowers are high-risk (for example, loans to subprime borrowers) and some are mediumto lowerrisk (for example, Alt-A and prime borrowers). If fully serviced the interest payable on the loans is equivalent
to 10%, resulting in an interest cash $ow of $50 million plus principal repayments each year. A possible CDO
that can be formed is illustrated in Figure 18.1.

!e original set of bank loans with a zero default rate would yield \$50 million per annum of interest income.

!e bank that made the loans may try to o%oad a large part of the risk on the loans by bundling the various

loans and packaging them into a CDO. !e first tranche (Tranche 1) is known as the **equity tranche** and is the

riskiest part because, if there is a default on the first \$25 million of principal and interest, then the holders of

the equity tranche would be wiped out. Since this is the riskiest part of the CDO it attracts the highest rate of

interest, in this example 30%. Typically the equity tranche is not assigned a rating as it is understood to be high

risk. If the default rate goes above \$25 million then Tranche 2 – the **junior tranche** - is next at risk. !e value

- f the junior tranche in the example is \$100 million, so if losses/defaults on interest and principal increase to
\$125 million this tranche would also be wiped out. Since the junior tranche is the next in line a(er the equity
tranche, it will have a relatively low credit rating, for example BBB, and attract a lower yield of, say, 15%. !is
yield is lower than that of the equity tranche but higher than the next tranche at risk, which is Tranche 3 –
the **mezzanine tranche** . Holders of the mezzanine tranche will only incur losses if defaults rise above \$125
million, but they will be wiped out if losses hit \$250 million. !e safest tranche, which was frequently given a
AAA rating, is Tranche 4 known as the **senior tranche** . It is only once losses exceed \$250 million that losses
will be suffered by owners of this tranche. Since it is the safest tranche it attracts the lowest rate of return; in
the example, this is set at 6% per annum.

Since the various tranches of a CDO have different risk–return characteristics the credit rating agencies

such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's play a pivotal role in assigning credit ratings to them. When assigning

its credit ratings, Moody's applies a methodology that looks at the default correlations between the various

securities in the pool, the average credit quality of the pool of securities, the structure of the CDO and expected

losses to each tranche. !e fact that the CDO was sliced up into various tranches makes it an attractive security

for different types of investors – for example, pension funds would be attracted to the AAA tranche, hedge

funds to the junior tranche and other banks to the mezzanine tranche.

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

Although the above example gives a good idea of what a CDO is, there are a number of additional important

points that need to be made. !e first is that each CDO is a unique package; the quality of the CDO and the

credit rating attached to each of its tranches will depend upon the quality of the original bank loans and

how these have been packaged in the CDO. Another point is that even if some of the borrowers default on

their bank loans there is likely to be some recovery against the assets owned by the defaulting borrower. For

example, if one of the loans in the CDO is for \$500,000 against a house purchase then if the borrower defaults

the bank will still be able to foreclose on the home and this will have some value, say \$300,000 a(er recovery

expenses, that can be used to repay the CDO holders. !ere are likely to be some covenants in the CDO that

make it hard for the originating bank to reschedule and renegotiate loans with the original borrowers if they

are having di'culty making payments.

All of these factors make the pricing of a CDO a very complex issue as the cash $ows of each CDO are

highly uncertain. Assumptions about timings of defaults, default rates, recovery rates, the impact of covenants

and the fact that each CDO is unique combine to make designing the correct pricing structure a di'cult task.

As we shall see later in the chapter, the complexity of the CDOs and di'culties of determining their secondary

market values ultimately became quite crucial in the evolution of the credit crunch.

It should be noted that many CDOs were issued by banks to free up capital that the bank would otherwise be

forced to hold against those loans. If loans are made and then the risks of the loans sold off to other investors,

then banks have new capital to make further loans, undertake share buy backs or develop new products while

freeing themselves of the credit risk of the loans they have made. In our example, suppose that the bank has a

loan book worth \$500 million and is required to hold regulatory capital of 8% (that is, \$40)million) to cover

potential losses. By selling the CDO the bank sells 95% of its loan book, retaining the equity piece worth

5% of the \$500 million – it is required to hold 100% of the equity piece, that is \$25 million, for regulatory

capital purposes. As such the bank has managed to reduce its regulatory capital holding from \$40 million to

\$25)million, a saving of \$15 million. In addition, it has raised \$475 million from selling the CDO. Of course,

the debt repayments on the loans are now used to make payments to the holders of the various tranches of

the CDO rather than accrue to the bank. As such, the returns the bank gets on its \$475 million cash received

from the CDO become crucial to determining the overall profitability of creating the CDO.

!ere are variations in CDOs. One of the most notorious is the CDO squared (CDO [2] ), which is a CDO

based upon a package of existing CDOs or tranches of differing CDOs. A collateralized loan obligation (CLO)

is simply a CDO based upon a package of loans, such as a package of auto loans, student loans or credit

card loans. A collateralized bond obligation (CBO) is a CDO based upon a pool of bonds, such as a pool

- f corporate bonds. One issue of concern with a CDO is the asymmetric information involved – the bank
creating the CDO is more likely to understand the quality of the loans behind the CDO than outside investors.
!is problem is partially solved by the bank retaining the risky equity tranche of the CDO, so that it suffers the
first loss before outside investors. Also by holding the equity tranche, the bank is more likely to monitor and
enforce the loan than if the entire loan has been sold off to a third party.

18.3 SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE/SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY

When a CDO or other securitized product is sold onto the market it is usual for a bank to sponsor the

formation of a **special purpose vehicle** (SPV), or special purpose entity (SPE) in the USA. An SPV/SPE is a

legal entity set up for a specific limited purpose by another entity or a sponsoring firm. An SPV/SPE can take

- n one of three forms: a trust, a partnership, or a limited liability company. !e SPV/SPE may be a subsidiary
- f the sponsoring firm, or it may be an 'orphan' SPV/SPE, one that is not consolidated with the sponsoring

475

International Finance

firm for tax, accounting or legal purposes (or may be consolidated for some purposes but not others). An

SPV/SPE is normally incorporated in an offshore centre such as the Cayman Islands.

In the context of a typical securitization, the SPV/SPE takes the form of a trust which is 'demonstrably

distinct' from the sponsoring bank in that the sponsoring bank cannot unilaterally dissolve the SPV. In

addition, the SPV/SPE must be 'bankruptcy remote', which means it will not be dissolved if the sponsoring

bank were to go bankrupt, and the SPV/SPE is structured in such a way that it cannot itself become legally

bankrupt. !e fact that the SPV/SPE is bankruptcy remote provides some comfort for investors in the SPV/

SPE since it cannot go under if the sponsoring bank were to get into trouble. An SPV/SPE is set up for a specific

purpose or circumscribed activity or a series of such transactions. SPVs/SPEs have no other purpose than the

transaction(s) for which they were created. !e SPV/SPE can make no substantive decisions since the rules

governing them are set down in advance and carefully circumscribe their activities. An SPV/SPE is merely a

legal/accounting entity with no employees or even physical location. A typical SPV is thinly capitalized, its

assets are serviced by a servicing department and its administrative functions are performed by a trustee that

follows pre-specified rules with regard to the receipt and distribution of money.

A bank transfers loans or mortgages to the SPV/SPE, which then securitizes the pool of assets into a

securitized product such as a CDO or an asset-backed security (ABS) and manages the cash $ows from the

assets to ensure payments to investors in the CDO or ABS. By sponsoring the transfer of assets to the SPV/

SPE, the parent bank can in theory eliminate its risk because writedowns on the assets due to non-payment

by borrowers will be suffered by the SPV/SPE and not the parent bank. In this sense an SPV/SPE is different

from a subsidiary company because losses by the subsidiary would hit the profitability of the parent company.

By setting up a separate company to manage the securities the bank is able to isolate itself from the financial

risks. However, it is important to understand that the sponsoring bank o(en makes implicit commitments

to the SPV/SPE, known as 'implicit recourse' or 'moral recourse', whereby it is expected to provide credit

and other support beyond its contractual obligations. !is is widely recognized by regulators, credit rating

agencies and the sponsoring bank such that the sponsoring parent bank will suffer a loss even though, from a

legal/accounting perspective, it is not required to do so.

18.4 A STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLE

!e first structured investment vehicle (SIV) was set up in 1988 by Citigroup, and SIVs have since become

part of what is popularly known as the 'shadow banking system'. An SIV is a pool of assets and liabilities

that attempts to exploit the difference between shortand long-term interest rates. !e basic idea of an SIV

is in essence quite simple – to raise funds at the short end of the market at relatively low rates of interest

and invest those funds in longer-term securities at higher yields. !e aim of the SIV is to capture the spread

between the low funding costs of their short-term liabilities and higher returns on their longer-term assets.

A typical SIV would raise money from the money markets primarily through the issuance of short-term

commercial paper of, say, 90 and 180 days and medium-term notes with a maturity of 1 to 2 years. !e

funds are then invested in a variety of longer-term securities such as corporate bonds, Treasury bonds

and structured finance products including ABSs and CDOs made up of things like mortgages, credit card

receivables and student loans. !e typical spread income for an SIV is 20 to 30 basis points. A typical SIV

has some basic equity funding (initial capital) and usually employs a large degree of leverage, typically

between 10 and 20 times the equity funding. One motivation for banks to set up SIVs is that they are far less

regulated than the bank itself, and the requirements for capital against losses are usually much lower than

that required by regulators.

476

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

One obvious risk of SIVs is that in a liquidity crisis they would be unable to roll over their short-term

liabilities (that is, refinance them once they mature). As such, an SIV would typically seek a backstop facility

from a parent bank or group of banks, enabling it to cover some of its issuance in the event of market disruption

that prevented it successfully issuing some of its commercial paper. It is important to note that an SIV is a

separate legal entity and its commercial paper issuance would be given a credit rating from one or both of the

major credit rating agencies (Standard & Poor's and Moody's). In certain cases, SPVs/SPEs sell their assets to

an SIV which is mainly financed by the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP).

!ere are a number of differences between SIVs (shadow banking) and the traditional banking model.

Under the traditional banking model the bank acts as an intermediary, dealing directly with depositors and

borrowers and a lot of effort is put into screening the credit worthiness of the borrowers in particular. In

contrast, the SIV is dependent on the short-term wholesale markets for funding and is therefore reliant on

the work of the credit agencies to establish the credit worthiness of the securities it invests in. Another key

difference is that in the traditional banking model the providers of funds (the depositors) are to some extent

protected by the deposit guarantee provided by, for example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

(FDIC) in the USA or the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the UK. !is is not so in the case of buyers

- f the commercial paper and medium-term notes that fund the SIV who are subject to the risk of substantial
losses if the SIV were to get into trouble.

!e SIVs were badly affected by the credit crunch. As it became apparent that a lot of the banks were in

trouble, banks stopped lending to each other. !e SIVs also found themselves in trouble as they had invested

heavily in CDOs and subprime mortgages. !e SIVs quickly found themselves unable to refinance their

commercial paper except at very high rates of interest, and had to start selling some of their assets, such

as CDOs, at heavily discounted prices into a distressed market. !e credit rating agencies also started to

downgrade the ratings of the SIVs during the crisis, which either made funding themselves with commercial

paper prohibitively expensive or made them reliant on bank credit lines to continue operating. Hence, the

SIVs were badly hit by a combination of liquidity risk, because they were unable to roll over their commercial

paper, and solvency risk, because the value of their assets fell below the value of their liabilities. One result of

the credit crunch is that SIVs became unviable and by the end of 2008 there were no SIVs in operation.

18.5 CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

Another significant financial innovation that played a crucial role in the credit crunch was the development

- f credit derivatives and in particular **credit default swaps** (CDSs). A credit derivative is a contract between
two parties – a protection buyer and a protection seller – in which the seller sells credit protection to the buyer
against the credit risk of a third party. !e third party is known as the **reference entity** and may be a company

- r a government that has issued debt. Credit derivatives fall into two categories: unfunded credit derivatives
and funded credit derivatives.

1. With an unfunded credit derivative the contract between the two parties means that payments

are cash settled. For instance, the protection buyer will pay premiums in cash and receive a cash

settlement from the seller of the credit risk protection if a credit event occurs.

2. With a funded credit derivative the party that assumes the credit risk, that is the protection seller,

will make an initial payment that can be used to settle a credit event. !is feature makes a funded

credit derivative a lot safer since the protection buyer does not need to concern themselves with the

counterparty risk of the protection seller.

477

International Finance

!e meaning of a credit event is crucial and will be specified in a credit derivative contract. It may include

the bankruptcy of the reference entity, a restructuring of payments by the reference entity, a failure by

the)reference)entity to make a scheduled payment or a moratorium on payments by the reference entity (see

Box 18.1).

_Credit default swaps_

!e most common credit derivative is a credit default swap (CDS), which is similar to an insurance product.

In theory there are good reasons to believe that insurance against a default is a good idea. However, the

uncontrolled writing of CDS contracts by the leading insurance company American International Group

(AIG) ultimately led to its failure and resulted in it being taken over by the US government. In 2007 the

International Swap and Derivatives Association (www.isda.org) reported that the total amount of credit

derivatives outstanding was \$62.2 trillion, up from \$0.5 trillion in 2000 (see Table 18.1). !e main centre

for trading in credit derivatives is London and the vast majority of trading in such contracts is conducted

by insurance companies, commercial and investment banks, securities firms, hedge funds, pension funds,

speculators and corporations in the over-the-counter market.

A CDS is a credit derivative contract in which one party (the protection buyer) pays a periodic fee to

another party (the protection seller) in return for a payout in the instance of a credit event by a reference

entity. It is important to understand that the reference entity is not a party to the CDS, and it is not necessary

for the protection buyer to suffer an actual loss in order to be eligible for a payout if a credit event occurs.

When a credit event occurs, the protection buyer will issue the protection seller a credit event notice

making the basis for a claim against the protection seller. In effect, a CDS enables the protection buyer to

short the credit risk of the reference entity, while the protection seller is taking a long position on the credit

risk of the reference entity. Each contract sets out the specific terms of the agreement including identification

- f the underlying asset (loan or bond), what constitutes a credit event and the settlement process. !e vast
majority of CDS contacts have a non-bank corporate as the reference entity, followed by CDS contracts with

**Box 18.1 What constitutes a credit event?**

!e International Swaps and Derivatives Association specifies five things that could constitute a credit

event. A credit default swap will specify one or more of the five as constituting a credit event, and so

trigger payments from a protection seller to a protection buyer.

   - **Bankruptcy** : A corporate becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts. !e bankruptcy event
is, of course, not relevant for sovereign issuers.

   - **Failure to pay:** Failure of the reference entity to make due payments greater than the specified
payment requirement (typically \$1 million), taking into account some grace period to prevent
accidental triggering due to an administrative error.

   - **Obligations acceleration/obligations default** : Obligations that have become due and payable
earlier than they would have been because of default or similar condition or obligations have
become capable of being defined due and payable earlier than they would have been because of
a default or similar condition. !e latter description is the more encompassing definition and
is generally preferred by the protection buyer. !e aggregate amount of obligations must be
greater than the default requirement (typically \$10 million).

   - **Repudiation/moratorium** : A reference entity or government authority rejects or challenges the
validity of the obligations.

   - **Restructuring changes** : Restructuring changes in the debt obligations of the reference creditor,
excluding those that are not associated with credit deterioration, such as a renegotiation of
more favourable terms.

banks as the reference entity. Trading in sovereign CDS contracts, contracts in which the reference entity is

government debt, has been growing over the years. !e growth has been especially strong in bonds issued by

emerging market economies where the risk of a credit event is, generally speaking, significantly higher than

for developed market economies. A typical credit default swap is set out in Table 18.2.

Table 18.2 shows the details of a straightforward CDS on company ABC. !e duration of the contract is

5 years and the notional size of the contract is \$10 million of debt. !e contract is to be settled by means of

physical delivery of bonds with a face value of \$10 million and a maturity of 5 years to the protections seller,

who will pay the difference between the secondary value of the debt and the face value of the debt in the event

- f a bankruptcy filing by company ABC. !e possible payout profiles are depicted in Figure 18.2.

!e quarterly premium which is typical for corporate CDOs is simply determined by the face value of the

contract times the basis points per annum times 0.25 to re$ect the quarterly premium payable. In this case, the

annual premium is 100 basis points (i.e. 1% of face value of \$10 million) therefore the quarterly premium is:

$10,000,000                  - 0.01                  - 0.25 = $25,000

so that the annual premium is \$100,000 to insure against the risk of default on \$10 million of debt, payable in

quarterly instalments of \$25,000.

It is important to understand that the contract typically lasts for five years and the premium payable is set

by the protection seller for the lifetime of the contract. !ere is, however, a secondary market for the CDS

premiums once issued. If the credit worthiness of the reference entity deteriorates then this will be re$ected

in a rise in the basis points payable in the secondary market. For instance, if the likelihood of company ABC

filing for bankruptcy rises a(er one year then the basis points charged will rise from, say, 100 to 150 basis

points. !e premiums payable on the secondary market would then rise from \$100,000 per year to \$150,000

per year, meaning a potential profit of \$50,000 a year for the remaining four years of the contract, or \$200,000

in total, for a protection buyer. Note that the maturity of the CDS does not need to correspond to the maturity

- f the underlying debt of the reference entity – it is quite usual for the CDS to specify a debt instrument (for
example, bonds with 10 years to maturity) with a longer term to maturity than the CDS (typically five years).

Although CDS contracts are like an insurance product in many ways there are some characteristics that

make them quite different. !e protection buyer does not need to have any interest in the reference entity or

to have suffered an actual financial loss to make a claim if a credit event occurs. In other words, the protection

buyer may or may not hold any debt issued by the reference entity. By contrast, with a normal insurance

product you need to have an 'insurable interest' in the item you insure; for example, you can insure your own

house as you will suffer a loss if it burns down, but you will not normally be allowed to insure a stranger's

480

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

house and benefit if it burns down. Also, an insurance contract pays out a buyer if a loss has actually been

sustained, whereas a CDS contract is more akin to a bet on whether a 'credit event' will or will not occur.

Furthermore, since CDSs are over-the-counter products, they do not involve the same actuarial analysis

as a typical insurance product. Instead, the analysis is based upon the financial strength of the reference

entity issuing the underlying credit asset (loan or bond). Unlike insurance products which require regulatory

capital to be set aside to meet prospective claims, there are no regulatory capital requirements imposed on the

protection seller. In addition, since the protection seller has no relationship with the reference entity then the

seller cannot make a claim against or sue the reference entity.

Once a credit event occurs either one or both parties issues a credit event notice to the other party, based

upon publicly available information such as specified news sources, which if validated will trigger the settlement

- f the CDS. !ere are two ways in which a CDS can be settled: cash or physical settlement. With a physical
settlement the protection buyer delivers the face value of the underlying security or comparable securities
specified in the CDS contract ( _pari passu_ - r equivalent securities) to the protection buyer in exchange for the
face payment on the security. !e protection seller will then own the security and will be able to claim against
the reference entity or sell the security on to another party at the then prevailing secondary market price.
With cash settlement, the protection buyer will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the difference between
the par value of the security and a secondary market price of the security. !e secondary market price is
normally obtained from five dealers some 14 to 30 days a(er the occurrence of the credit event. In instances
where no reliable secondary market price can be determined, then cash settlement will be based upon other
instruments of similar quality and characteristics, such as maturity, outlined in the contract. It should be
noted that the protection buyer will stop all premium payments once a credit event has occurred, and this also
needs to be factored into the appropriate premium charged by the protection seller.

Rather than have a payoff based upon the difference between the face value of the security and its

secondary market price or recovery price, a **fixed recovery CDS** (or binary swap or digital swap) fixes the

amount of the payoff to be made should a credit event occur. !e fixed recovery CDS therefore removes

uncertainty over the payoff for both the protection buyer and protection seller. !e fixed recovery CDS can

be used to speculate on the recovery rate. For instance, say the protection seller assumes that there will be

a 50% recovery rate in the event of a default. If he sells protection on a CDS with a fixed payment of 40% of

the face value of the bonds, that is, \$4 million for a \$10 million contract, and the recovery rate is 50%, then

he will receive \$5 million upon recovery and make \$1 million of profit plus the premiums received. If the

actual recovery rate is below 50%, say only 30%, then the protection seller would make a loss of \$1 million

less the premiums received.

!ere are variations on the basic CDSs that we have outlined. For example, it is possible to have a CDS

contract that is based upon a basket of reference entities and a payment is made when one of the reference

entities incurs a credit event. Some CDSs require an upfront fee to be paid in addition to the quarterly

premiums. Such upfront fees can be particularly high if the reference entity is close to bankruptcy; for

example, an upfront fee could be \$2 million to \$3 million (on a notional value of \$10 million) if a company

has a high likelihood of filing for bankruptcy. Some CDSs are based upon a credit reference asset rather

than a credit reference entity. In such contracts, the recovery rate on the underlying asset is important to the

payout; for example, senior secured debt in the reference entity will have a higher recovery rate than junior

unsecured debt in the reference entity. With a contingent CDS, a payout requires both a credit event and an

additional trigger. !e additional trigger could be a credit event by another reference entity or a specified price

movement in some market security. In a dynamic CDS the notional amount determining the payout is linked

to the mark to market value of a portfolio of swaps.

481

International Finance

One problem with CDS contracts is that they are bought and sold as individual contracts and appear not to

be subject to securities laws. !ere is no regulatory body that governs the buying and selling of CDSs. While

the International Swaps and Derivatives Association provides recommended CDS documentation guidelines

it is not a regulatory body that issues legally enforceable regulations. Also, since the protection seller does

not have to set aside capital against a credit event, the buyer of credit protection is subject to noticeable

counterparty risk.

!e first CDS products were developed in the mid-1990s and the market expanded rapidly from around

\$631 billion in the first half of 2001 to an estimated \$62 trillion in the second half of 2007. In the early 2000s

the CDS market changed in three substantive ways:

1. A secondary market developed and new parties became involved in the CDS market. !is

development made it more di'cult to determine the financial strength of the protection seller.

2. CDSs were issued for SIVs, ABSs, mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and even CDOs. !ese

investments no longer had a known entity by which to determine the strength of a particular loan or

bond, unlike the case for commercial loans, corporate bonds or municipal bonds.

3. !e CDS market became used far more for speculation rather than hedging. Rampant speculation in

the market meant that buyers and sellers of CDS contracts were no longer owners of the underlying

asset (bond or loan), but were just 'betting' on the possibility of a credit event of a specific asset.

18.6 THE PRICING OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES

!e pricing of credit derivatives is an enormously complex area and the level of modelling required is well

beyond the scope of this book. However, it is clear that there are two crucial factors that need to be borne in

mind when calculating the appropriate price of a credit derivative:

1. !e likelihood of default.
!e payment or payoff to be made in the event of a default.

!e likelihood of default will depend upon the credit rating of the reference entity, it being less likely to default

if it is an AA rated issuer than if it is a BBB rated issuer. !e payment to be made in the event of a default will

depend upon recovery rates if the issuer defaults. !e recovery rate will crucially depend on whether the debt

is senior (unsubordinated) or junior (subordinated). In addition, there is a difference in recovery rates for

senior secured bonds than for senior unsecured bonds and likewise between junior secured and unsecured

bonds. Traditionally, secured bonds have quite good recovery rates, in the region of 60 to 90 cents per dollar,

while junior unsecured bonds have much lower recovery rates, in the region of 10 to 25 cents per dollar.

Under certain highly restrictive conditions, the annual premium payable for a CDS is approximately

equal to the yield of a corporate bond, less the risk-free rate of interest, of the same length to maturity as the

reference entity. For example, if a five-year Treasury bond yields 5% and the reference entity issues a bond

with five years to maturity at 6% then the credit premium will be equal to 100 basis points or \$100,000 per

annum on a notional principal amount of \$10,000,000. Unfortunately, the calculation of the actual premium

payable is far more complex than this simplification. Nonetheless, the basic idea generally holds that the

higher the corporate bond spread the higher the CDS premium payable.

Having looked at the various financial instruments such as CDOs and CDSs and investment vehicles such

as SPVs/SPE and SIVs, we are now in a position to proceed to an analysis of the credit crunch.

482

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

**Box 18.2 Credit derivatives and the fall of American International Group**

American International Group (AIG) was the world's largest insurance group, dealing with all types

- f insurance including commercial, health, residential and life insurance. It was ranked as the tenth
largest company in the _Fortune_ 500 list of American companies in April 2007, and was, generally
speaking, a very profitable company. On 28 February 2008 it announced annual profits of \$6.2 billion
and had a market capitalization of \$95.8 billion with its shares trading at \$50.50. However, by October
2008 its share price had collapsed below \$1 following a dramatic rescue by the American taxpayer on
NaN.September.

In 1998 AIG Financial Products Division (AIGFP) made the fateful decision to get involved in selling

protection in CDSs, especially on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations which

were o(en made up of bundles of subprime mortgages. !ings went well during the period 1998–2006

as AIG was picking up premiums from selling the CDSs and making virtually no payouts. Insurance

is a great business to be in when you are collecting premiums and not having to make any payouts!

!e Financial Products Division employed around 430 staff, mostly in London, and had written some

44,000 complex, o(en long-term contracts with a notional value of \$2 trillion. Over time, AIGFP had

become a multi-strategy hedge fund engaged in a variety of businesses. In addition to CDSs, it wrote

and traded equity, currency and commodity derivatives.

According to Gerry Pasciucco, who was given the job of unwinding AIG's exposures following its

collapse, it was AIG's exposure to fewer than 200 insurance contracts that were sensitive to its credit

ratings and the value of the underlying CDOs that led to its collapse. !ere were several features of AIG's

contracts on CDOs that made them potentially dangerous. Firstly, they were mostly unhedged and

the contracts required AIG to post billions of dollars of collateral if its credit rating was downgraded.

Secondly, AIG agreed to post collateral if there was a fall in the market value of the CDOs it insured,

even if there were no credit downgrades or defaults on the CDOs. As the credit crisis developed, the

price of CDOs that AIG had insured began to collapse and on 15 September 2008 the ratings agencies

downgraded its rating: Moody's cut AIG's rating from Aa3 to A2, Standard & Poor's and Fitch both

reduced its rating from AA– to A–. !e downgrades and fall in price of CDOs forced AIG to post

tens of billions of dollars of collateral with its counterparties, but the amount of collateral required

soon exceeded its resources. On 16 September 2008, the American government intervened, with an

\$85 billion credit line in exchange for a 79.9% stake to prevent AIG's collapse. !e US government

deemed that AIG was 'too big and too interconnected' to fail. !e failure of AIG would have led to

severe financial problems in dozens of other major financial institutions that had paid premiums to AIG

to protect themselves against defaults in CDOs they owned.

In March 2009 AIG announced the largest ever loss in corporate history of \$61.7 billion for its final

quarter of 2008, and it is estimated that its total losses could eventually be in excess of \$180 billion. !e

government was forced to reveal payouts from AIG to some of its major counterparties. From late 2007

through 2008 Société Générale received \$16.5 billion, Goldman Sachs received \$14 billion, Deutsche

Bank received \$8.5 billion and Merrill Lynch \$6.2 billion. Had the US Treasury not made these payouts

then the problems facing some of these financial institutions would have been greatly exacerbated.

AIG caused a massive public storm in January 2009 when it revealed that it had set aside \$450 million

in retention bonuses to pay some 400 of its staff who were in the process of unwinding its complex

trades. Many of these staff had been involved in writing the very contracts that led to AIG's failure but

483

International Finance

were deemed to be essential to successfully unwinding the complex trades that ruined the company. Not

surprisingly, in March 2009 Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, stated:

If there is a single episode in this entire 18 months that has made me more angry, I can't think of

   - ne other than AIG. AIG exploited a huge gap in the regulatory system, there was no oversight
   - f the financial products division, this was a hedge fund basically that was attached to a large and
stable insurance company.

18.7 THE CREDIT CRUNCH

!e credit crunch which started on 9 August 2007 is generally viewed as the most significant crisis to affect

the financial markets and the global economy since the 1930s. !e term 'credit crunch' refers to the sudden

and very significant tightening of lending conditions in the financial system which happened independently

- f o'cial interest rates. In particular, there was a pronounced fall off in lending, both between banks on the
interbank market and between banks and their clients. Many other features also came into play, such as an
increase in risk aversion combined with declines in the price of risky assets such as equities and corporate
bonds and a $ight to quality assets such as Treasury bonds. In the remainder of this chapter, we consider the
causes of the credit crunch, the issues raised by the crisis, the policy response to the crisis, its economic impact
and some of the lessons to be learned from it.

_The dimensions of the credit crunch_

!e 2007 credit crunch is generally considered to have been triggered by losses on subprime mortgages

in the USA, but its impact was too wide and too deep to be explained by losses in that sector alone. !e

crisis led to the two mortgage financing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with combined loans totalling

\$5.5)trillion, being placed under the control of the US government, and in March 2008 Bear Stearns had to be

rescued through a merger with Bank of America. Shares in most of the top banks around the world plunged

dramatically in value, as depicted in Table 18.3.

!e crisis took a particularly nasty turn on 29 September 2008 when the investment bank Lehman

Brothers was placed into bankruptcy (see Box 18.3). !e Lehman bankruptcy set off significant falls in

global stock markets around the world. In order to survive the crisis, major commercial and investment

banks like Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch became heavily reliant on funds

and other support provided by the Federal Reserve and US Treasury. Another institution that found itself

drawn into the crisis was American International Group (AIG) that, due to losses from its London-based

Financial Products Division, had to be taken over by the American government with estimated losses in

excess of \$180 billion.

While the crisis started in the USA, it quickly spread itself throughout the world. In the UK, during

September 2007 the Northern Rock bank found itself unable to fund its mortgage book, and it was subjected

to the first **bank run** since 1866 as depositors queued to withdraw their money. !e bank run was only halted

a(er the government guaranteed all its deposits. By February 2008 it became evident that Northern Rock could

not survive and it had to be nationalized. !e Bradford & Bingley building society was also caught out in the

crisis and had to be rescued and taken over by the Treasury in September 2008. !e demise of Northern Rock

was later eclipsed by the problems at the Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) which was rescued through a merger

with Lloyds TSB bank. !e rescue proved to be fateful to Lloyds TSB as losses in HBOS led to Lloyds itself being

drawn into the crisis and having to be rescued by the UK taxpayer who took a 45% stake in the bank. In March

2009 the stake was raised to 65%. Another major bank drawn into the crisis was the Royal Bank of Scotland

(RBS) which over several years had become the largest bank in the UK. In December 2007 it made the fateful

decision to take over the Dutch bank ABN Amro. !e acquisition proved ill-timed and was not subjected to the

same degree of scrutiny that such an acquisition would normally attract. !e huge losses that later emerged on

the ABN deal (estimated to be as much as &22 billion), coupled with the problems on its own loan book, meant

that RBS had to be rescued by the UK government, which took a majority 70% holding in the bank.

!e UK financial sector was heavily hit by the crisis in general with the fall off in mergers and acquisitions,

underwriting activity, IPOs, commercial paper and corporate bond issues leading to tens of thousands of job

losses. Globally, estimates put job losses in the financial services sector at 350,000 during 2008 and the first

half of 2009, approximately 20% of the pre-crisis workforce.

485

International Finance

While a great deal of the crisis was concentrated in the USA and the UK, it had a significant effect on both

commercial and investment banks in many other nations. In Switzerland the Union Bank of Switzerland

(UBS) had losses on its subprime exposure in excess of 40 billion dollars. In Germany, although the property

market had been stagnant for many years, many German banks had losses from CDOs and SIVs amounting

to tens of billions of euros. Banks in other countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and even Australia also

had large losses resulting from their holdings of subprime securities. More dramatically, banks in Iceland and

Ireland which had boomed in the preceding years were brought to the point of collapse.

**Box 18.3 The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy**

On 15 September 2008 Lehman Brothers Holdings, the fourth largest investment bank on Wall Street,

filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was the largest bankruptcy in US history, sparking large falls in

stock markets around the globe. !e collapse of Lehman Brothers and the downfall of its CEO Dick

Fuld became one of the biggest stories of the credit crunch, and set off the most complex bankruptcy

in history. Prior to its collapse, Lehman was a global investment bank dealing with a huge range of

interests covering investment banking, equity and bonds trading, derivatives, securitization and wealth

management. It had o'ces around the world, including New York, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong,

the Middle East and Latin America. Lehman Brothers had a long and distinguished history, having

  - riginally been formed as a cotton brokerage in 1850. Just prior to its collapse it was employing some
28,600 staff worldwide.

!e losses that brought Lehman down were primarily due to its large exposure to subprime

mortgages through its CDO holdings. !e precise reasons as to why Lehman had accumulated such

a large exposure to the subprime sector are unclear: it was either holding the risky tranches of CDOs

willingly or holding them unwillingly because it could not find buyers. In the second quarter of 2008

Lehman announced losses of \$2.4 billion and its stock, which had been falling since the collapse of

Bear Stearns in March, began to decline dramatically. In a bid to protect shareholders the CEO Dick

Fuld looked around for interested parties which would be willing to buy Lehman, including Korea

Development Bank (KDB). However, on 9 September KDB made it clear that it was not going ahead

with a deal, leading to a continued collapse of Lehman’s shares. As things became critical, an attempt

was made to sell the company over the weekend of 13–14 September to Barclays or Bank of America,

but a deal could not be reached, and the Federal Reserve Chief, Ben Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary,

Hank Paulson, made it clear that they would not step in to save Lehman. So on 15 September Lehman

filed for bankruptcy, citing assets of \$639 billion and liabilities made up of bank debt and bond debt of

\$768 billion – a gap of \$129 billion.

Lehman's collapse created great uncertainty in the financial markets because it was a counterparty to

tens of thousands of contracts around the globe. Many hedge funds and financial institutions for which

Lehman was acting as broker/money manager found their accounts frozen and had problems executing

trades. !e Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 504 points, interbank interest rates rose significantly and

there was a rush to withdraw funds from money markets around the globe.

!e rise and fall of Lehman Brothers became inextricably linked to the rise and fall of its CEO

Dick Fuld, who had presided over the company since 1994. He joined the firm in 1969 and became a

formidable fixed income trader, eventually rising to CEO. During the years to 2006, profits at Lehman

rose dramatically and in 2006 _Institutional Investor_ placed Dick Fuld as number one CEO in its Brokers

486

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

and Asset Managers category. In the eight years prior to Lehman's collapse he earned an estimated \$300

million. From press accounts, it appears that Fuld was an authoritarian leader and did not listen to his

risk managers who were warning of potential trouble from the bank’s exposure to the subprime sector.

!e CDOs and CDSs being traded on Wall Street were very different instruments from those he had

traded in his days as a trader. !is, combined with his staff’s reluctance to give him a full picture of the

risks Lehman Brothers faced, probably contributed to the bank’s demise. !e bankruptcy of Lehman and

news of his earnings made Fuld a figurehead for Wall Street’s excesses. In December 2008, Fuld was the

inaugural winner of the _Financial Times_ ’ ‘Lex Overpaid CEO’ award for having received \$40.5 million

in 2006 and \$34m in 2007, the two years preceding Lehman's collapse. CNBC.com named Fuld at the

top of its list of 'Worst American CEOs of All Time', stating that he was 'belligerent and unrepentant'.

On 13 September 2013 www.money.cnn.com reported that Wall Street banks and lawyers had racked

up some \$2.2 billion in fees for managing the break up and winding down of Lehman by July 2013. Fee

beneficiaries included bankruptcy consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal who had generated \$657 million

and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges \$484 million. !e _Wall Street Journal_ reported on 2 February

2015 that some \$90.6 billion in cash had been raised for payment to creditors and that the process for

final settlement could extend to beyond 2018, making it a decade to finally settle the biggest corporate

failure in history.

18.8 CAUSES OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH

In the following analysis we shall argue that the credit crunch had multiple causes, many of which interacted

with one another in creating unsustainable levels of household debt and house prices. !is was especially true

in the USA and the UK, although housing bubbles were also evident in Ireland, Spain, Australia, Dubai and

even parts of China.

18.9 LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND DEREGULATION

Long before the credit crunch took place, there were background forces that encouraged banks to get more

heavily involved in the mortgage loan market. !e Basel Accord of 1988 required banks to hold less capital

for loans made for mortgages, which were regarded as relatively safe, than for consumer loans, which were

regarded as relatively risky. !is undoubtedly increased the incentive for banks to increase their mortgage

exposure. !e rescue of Long Term Capital Management in 1998 exacerbated the moral hazard in the financial

system. In 1999 the repeal of the **Glass-Steagall Act** and the setting up of the Federal Deposit Insurance

Corporation (FDIC) were key reforms. !e Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 had separated the US banking system

into two distinct types of banks: the commercial banking sector and the investment banking sector. Its repeal

followed heavy lobbying from the banking industry which argued that the distinction was not necessary

in the modern era, that it was hampering the competitiveness of the US banking system and that repeal of

the Act would bring greater stability to the financial system via diversification. !e repeal was important

in) that) it) enabled major commercial banks like Citigroup to get involved in the issuance of CDOs and

mortgage-backed securities, and in establishing SPVs/ SPEs, SIVs and other **conduits** that would ultimately

play such a significant role in the crisis. In addition, some believe that the investment banks' risk-taking

487

International Finance

culture started to permeate to the commercial banking sector following the repeal of the Act. !e other key

reform was the setting up of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect deposits in the

commercial banking sector.

!ese background factors combined with lax and irresponsible lending by banks and financial institutions,

who overestimated the ability of the process of financial innovation to manage and control their risks, were the

proximate causes of the crisis. Other contributing factors were the actions of the Federal Reserve following the dotcom bust and generally lax regulation of the financial system, the regulatory authorities having become convinced

that financial markets were engines of economic growth and were in general best le( to develop without excessive

interference from regulators. We shall argue that while the immediate trigger for the credit crisis was problems in

the subprime market, the magnitude of the eventual losses and the extent of the crisis strongly suggest that other

factors played a significant role in the crisis. In its 'Declaration of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World

Economy', dated 15 November 2008, leaders of the Group of 20 pinpointed a variety of causes:

During a period of strong global growth, growing capital $ows, and prolonged stability earlier in the

decade, market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and

failed to exercise proper due diligence. At the same time, weak underwriting standards, unsound risk

management practices, increasingly complex and opaque financial products, and consequent excessive

leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system. Policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in

some advanced countries, did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial

markets, keep pace with financial innovation, or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic

regulatory actions.

18.10 DETERIORATION IN BANK LENDING STANDARDS AND ADVERSE SELECTION

Another key factor behind the credit crunch was a deterioration in the quality of bank lending, especially the

rapid growth of lending to the subprime sector. In 1994 subprime loans were a mere 5% of total mortgage

- riginations and totalled \$35 billion. By 1999 this had risen to 13% of originations and \$160 billion of lending,
but by 2006 this had risen again to 20% of originations and \$600 billion of mortgage lending. By March 2007
the total exposure amounted to \$1.3 trillion. It seems that banks had moved from an originate-and-hold
model – meeting customers directly and screening them out – to an originate-to-distribute model whereby
they originated the loans, repackaged them into ABSs and CDOs and sold them to investors. !is was very
different from the traditional 'originate-and-hold' banking model, whereby banks originate the loans and keep
them and the risks on their own balance sheets. !e 'originate-to-distribute' model paid mortgage brokers an
upfront fee for each mortgage they arranged, and this encouraged them to emphasize quantity over quality
because no penalties were payable if the mortgagee later went into default or foreclosure. !e originator of the
loan also had less incentive to monitor the loan since the risk of the loan was ultimately going to be securitized
and passed on to investors in the form of a MBS or CDO.

Most of the subprime mortgage loans were adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with low initial interest

rates which would rise significantly a(er one or two years. Since the subprime mortgages were viewed as

risky the interest rate charges were significantly higher than for Alt-A or prime loans. !is in itself also meant

that subprime mortgages had a significant **adverse selection** problem in that the high interest rate charges

tended to attract a larger proportion of borrowers who would default on payments than would be expected

for traditional mortgages. It seems that another problem with subprime mortgages was that banks failed to

screen out the higher-risk loans. !e job of granting the mortgages was le( to mortgage brokers that obtained

significant commissions from the banks when a mortgage loan was made, and this led to predatory lending

488

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

practices in which mortgage brokers encouraged people to take on bigger loans at higher rates of interest than

they could afford. !e extent of the lax lending practices was typified by the so-called popularity of NINJA

loans, which stood for 'No verified INcome, Jobs or Assets'. In the UK there was also plenty of evidence of lax

lending standards. Northern Rock, which had to be rescued by the government, had a 'Together' package which

granted mortgages and loans equivalent to 125% of the value of the property being purchased. !ese loans

were being marketed aggressively to customers who in the past would have only been extended mortgages of

around 80% of the value of the property. Some commentators believe that the origins for the subprime crisis

can be blamed in large part on the Clinton administration which encouraged mortgage providers like Fannie

Mae and Freddie Mac to engage in increased mortgage lending to lowto moderate-income groups and

neighbourhoods which were much riskier than their traditional markets.

18.11 INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD INDEBTEDNESS

!ere was an increase not only of mortgage debt but also other forms of debt such as student loans, auto loans

and credit card debt. US household debt as a percentage of disposable income rose from 60% of disposable

income in 1974 to 134% of disposable income in mid-2008. !e savings rate in the USA declined from 6% in

1993 to under 1% by 2006, while the ratio of total debt to disposable income rose from 75% to 120% over the

same period in the OECD area. Much of the build-up of debt was securitized as CDOs or MBSs and bought

by banks, fund managers, pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds.

!e Federal Reserve also played a significant part in creating the credit bubble by reacting to the fall in

the stock markets following the dot-com bust in 2000 and the 9/11 terrorist attacks with an unprecedented

loosening of American monetary policy. It cut the Federal Funds rate from 6.5% in May 2000 to an all-time

low of just 1% in June 2003. In retrospect, many commentators regard this as an over-reaction to the bust

in the internet sector which accounted for less than 2% of the American economy. !e low interest rates

contributed to a rapid expansion of mortgages and a rapid rise in house prices over the period. Indeed, the

lower cost of finance contributed to a high degree of speculative activity in the housing market; for example,

in areas like Miami there was '$ipping' of condos by speculators who quickly on-sold properties they had

bought for short-term profits. Also, there was a growth in bank lending based on mortgage equity withdrawals

whereby people were able to take out new loans based on the higher value of their house.

18.12 FINANCIAL INNOVATION AND THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES

Financial innovation undoubtedly played a significant role in the crisis. Many of the banks that had increased

their mortgage book, particularly in the subprime area, believed they could reduce their risk exposure and

save on regulatory capital through securitizing the mortgage loans they had made by issuing MBSs and CDOs.

It is essential to realize that the banks could not have sold on the CDOs and MBSs without ratings on the

securities being issued by the credit rating agencies. Crucially, the credit rating agencies gave the securities

credit ratings that in retrospect clearly under-rated the risks involved. Securities that should have merited BBB

and lower ratings were issued with AAA and AA ratings. !e precise reasons why the credit rating agencies

got their ratings so wrong is a matter of dispute; it has been argued that they had big financial incentives to

rate the securities generously in return for generous fees. Also, the assumptions they made when rating the

securities were found to be wanting. !ey assumed continued house price rises and unrealistically low default

rates when making the ratings. !e fact that the securities were given investment grade ratings is absolutely

489

International Finance

crucial. If they had been rated below BBB then far fewer loans and mortgages would have been made, and

many banks and financial institutions would not have bought the securities and suffered catastrophic losses.

In addition to the growth of CDOs and MBSs a key financial innovation that contributed directly to the

downfall of AIG and Lehman Brothers and created problems for many hedge funds was their exposure to the

CDSs. !e notional value of CDSs grew from \$500 billion in 2000 to \$62 trillion by 2007.

18.13 INCREASED LEVERAGE IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

Another key factor that played a prominent role in the credit crunch was the increased use of leverage, defined

as the ratio of total debt to shareholder capital being employed by investment banks and other financial

institutions. For instance, Merrill Lynch increased its leverage from 15 to over 30 times capital between 2003

and 2007, Lehman Brothers increased its leverage from around 22.7 to 29.7 times capital, Goldman Sachs

from around 18.7 to 25.2 and Morgan Stanley from around 23.2 to 32.4 while Bear Stearns increased its

leverage from around 27.2 to 32.5. !e investment banks were not alone in increasing their leverage ratios as

many hedge funds were also highly leveraged, ratios of 20 to 30 times capital being common. !e problem of

increased leverage is that, although it increases returns during the good times, it also increases the risk level

and therefore the dangers facing financial institutions during periods of negative returns. In the period 2003

to 2007 the increased leverage became even more problematic because many of the funds raised by investment

banks were used to purchases tranches of CDOs and MBSs. In the view of some commentators the investment

banks were guilty of both producing and consuming toxic securities.

18.14 MISPRICING OF RISK

!ere is a lot of evidence that there was widespread mispricing of CDOs by market participants and credit

rating agencies who were using David Li's Gaussian copula model which based the price of CDOs on the price

- f related CDSs. However, in an article in wired.com, Felix Salmon (2009) reported:

Li's formula, known as a Gaussian copula function, looked like an unambiguously positive breakthrough,

a piece of financial technology that allowed hugely complex risks to be modeled with more ease and

accuracy than ever before. With his brilliant spark of mathematical legerdemain, Li made it possible

for traders to sell vast quantities of new securities, expanding financial markets to unimaginable levels.

His method was adopted by everybody from bond investors and Wall Street banks to ratings agencies

and regulators. And it became so deeply entrenched – and was making people so much money – that

warnings about its limitations were largely ignored.

!en the model fell apart. Cracks started appearing early on, when financial markets began behaving

in ways that users of Li's formula hadn't expected. !e cracks became full-$edged canyons in 2008 –

when ruptures in the financial system's foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival

  - f the global banking system in serious peril.

In sum, the pricing of the CDOs did not properly re$etc the risks of the securities and the pricing formula

underpriced the risks involved.

David Li's paper, 'On Default Correlation: A Copula Function Approach', was published in 2000 in the

_Journal of Fixed Income_, and was very quickly adopted by Wall Street and the financial community. Li had

490

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

come up with an ingenious way to model default correlations without looking at historical data, but instead

by using prices of CDSs. Li's copula function led to a rapid growth of both the CDO and CDS markets; for

example, at the end of 2001 there was \$920 billion of CDSs outstanding and by the end of 2007 this had

grown to a staggering \$62 trillion. Similarly the CDO market which was \$275 billion in 2000 had grown to

\$4.7)trillion by 2006. !e $aw in the formula was that it was used in a period when house prices rose rapidly,

and this led to extremely low default rates and also low correlations between defaults. However, if house price

rises turned to house price falls and default correlations were to rise rapidly then the CDO yields predicted

by the model were too low and CDS contracts seriously underpriced. To quote Kai Gilkes who worked for

10)years at the ratings agencies:

Everyone was pinning their hopes on house prices continuing to rise … When they stopped rising,

pretty much everyone was caught on the wrong side, because the sensitivity to house prices was huge.

And there was just no getting around it. Why didn't rating agencies build in some cushion for this

sensitivity to a house-price-depreciation scenario? Because if they had, they would have never rated a

single mortgage-backed CDO.

18.15 INCENTIVE STRUCTURES AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN THE BANKS

!e creation of new securities such as CDOs and CDSs and the boom in lending and house prices made

banking and the financial services industry very profitable. During the period 2000–2006 financial sector

earnings accounted for nearly 40% of the earnings of S&P 500 companies. As profits boomed so did the pay

packets of traders and top-level bankers. However, in retrospect it is clear that the level of risk being taken was

excessive and that the markets were underpricing the risks involved in the housing and construction boom.

!e rewards being generated during the good times meant that bankers and traders were more interested in

continuing the boom than monitoring the risks that were being accumulated in the system.

!ere were clearly problems with the incentive and reward structure of the banks, which were biased to

the generation of short-term profits and not the long-run viability of the banks. As many commentators have

pointed out, the annual system of bonuses in Wall Street and London meant that bankers and traders could

get large bonuses when times were good which would not be clawed back in bad times. Indeed, even in the

disastrous year of 2008 when banks were reporting unprecedented losses of over \$500 billion and banking

share prices collapsed, Wall Street bankers received bonuses in excess of \$70 billion. It seems that much of the

remuneration and bonus packages offered to investment bankers was dependent on revenues earned rather

than profits earned. With such a system, large bonuses were payable even if huge losses were being incurred. In

retrospect, it is clear that many of the profits reported during the 2002 to 2007 period were 'illusory profits' as

they were in fact the foundations for the massive losses reported once the credit crunch started (see Table)18.4).

It is also clear in retrospect that the banks' risk management systems were not up to the job. In particular,

banks lent too much money to people who were likely to default on their payments, placed too much faith in the

credit rating agencies' ratings of highly dangerous securities, and their risk management models underestimated

the risks they were taking. Most banks were using sophisticated Value at Risk modelling techniques to manage

their day-to-day risk exposure, but these models were deeply $awed by the assumptions they were making,

especially about house prices and the behaviour of macro variables. In addition, they were clearly not prepared

for the drying up of liquidity in the financial system, and failed to manage their counterparty exposures. !ere

can be little doubt that many more financial institutions would have been in)even greater di'culty if the

American government had not stepped in to make good the payments due from AIG.

18.16 THE RESPONSE TO THE CREDIT CRUNCH

When the credit crunch started on 9 August 2007, market participants and the authorities clearly failed to

understand the full extent of the crisis that was to ensue. Indeed, in June 2007 the Head of the Federal Reserve

Ben Bernanke made a speech arguing that subprime losses would be contained and limited to \$100 billion. It

took more than a year – a time that saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG, the taking over of Fannie

Mae and Freddie Mac and a collapse in the prices of banking sector shares – for the full scale of the crisis to

become evident for all to see. In particular, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and takeover of AIG by the US

government showed the huge amount of counterparty risk that had built up in the system. While institutions

like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Citigroup and Bank of America were deemed to be 'too big to fail', the world's

largest insurer AIG was considered to be both 'too big and too interconnected' to fail. Although the financial

crisis started in August 2007 the effects on the real economy took some time to take a grip. It was really only

in the second half of 2008 that economic growth and international trade started to collapse and the full cost

to taxpayers of the financial bailout and economic recession became evident.

Due to fears of financial and economic collapse, the authorities in the USA and the UK in particular

responded with unprecedented action, with similar responses in countries such as China, Japan and Germany.

We shall divide our discussion of the o'cial policy response to the crisis into the following:

1. Cuts in o'cial short-term interest rates
2. Liquidity provision
3. Quantitative easing
4. Fiscal stimulus packages to stimulate the economy
O'cial bailouts of troubled financial institutions

6. Bank stress tests
7. Regulatory response
8. Fines

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

**Box 18.4 The bonus culture in banking: no rhyme or reason**

!e massive losses in American banks as a result of the subprime crisis led to an intense debate about

rewards in the financial services industry, and especially in banks where huge pay packages have been

awarded to CEOs and bank traders. Stories abound about individual pay packages, such as Hank

Paulson earning \$700 million while working at Goldman Sachs, Charles Prince, the head of Citigroup,

earning over \$30 million a year while the bank's share price collapsed, and in Britain Sir Fred Goodwin,

the CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, was granted a £700,000 per annum pension at the age of 50

despite his bank having racked up enormous losses.

!e extent of the bonus culture in the banking system was investigated by Andrew Cuomo, the

Attorney General of New York as a direct result of the financial crisis and his report was released in

August 2009. Entitled, _No Rhyme or Reason: Te Heads I Win, Tails You Lose Bonus Culture_, the report

is extremely critical of the bonus culture in banking. It argues that the bankers' claim that high pay is

related to high performance is spurious and that the link between pay and performance is in practice

virtually non-existent. !e report states:

In many ways, the past three years have provided a virtual laboratory in which to test the

hypothesis that compensation in the financial industry was performance-based. But even a

cursory examination of the data suggests that in these challenging economic times, compensation

for bank employees has become unmoored from the banks' financial performance.

!us, when the banks did well, their employees were paid well. When the banks did poorly,

their employees were paid well. And when the banks did very poorly, they were bailed out by

taxpayers and their employees were still paid well. Bonuses and overall compensation did not

vary significantly as profits diminished.

!e report looks at the 2008 bonuses and earnings at nine banks that received bailouts totalling

\$55)billion. Two firms, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, suffered massive losses of more than \$27 billion

each but nonetheless Citigroup paid out \$5.33 billion in bonuses and Merrill paid \$3.6 billion in

bonuses. So, despite losing a combined \$54 billion, they still paid out nearly \$9 billion in bonuses!

A)look at historical filings further supports the view that there is no link between pay and performance.

Pay increased greatly during the bull-market years of 2003 to 2006; for example, at Bank of America

gross pay increased from \$10 billion to \$18 billion but in 2008 remained at \$18 billion despite huge

losses. A)similar pattern occurred at Citigroup where gross pay rose from \$20 billion to \$30 billion

during 2003–06 and remained at \$30 billion in 2007 even though the firm ran into major financial

di'culties. At Merrill Lynch gross pay was nearly \$16 billion in 2007 while losing \$7 billion and was

still close to \$15 billion in 2008 despite the bank facing collapse. Table 18.5 shows the bonus pools of the

first nine US banks to receive funds from the Trouble Asset Relief Programme (TARP). It shows each

bank’s earnings/losses, bonus pool, number of employees, earnings per employee, bonus per employee,

amount of TARP funds received and the amount of bonus payments in excess of \$3 million, \$2 million

and \$1 million.

Cuomo's report concludes that:

In sum, as we seek to learn lessons from this economic crisis and repair the damage it has

wrought, it will be vital to develop and implement sound principles and rationales for executive

compensation and bonuses that promote sustainable and rational economic growth. !e repeated

explanation from bank executives that bonuses are tied to performance in a manner designed

to promote such growth does not appear to be accurate. Indeed, our investigation suggests a

disconnect between compensation and bank performance that resulted in a 'heads I win, tails you

lose' bonus system. In other words, bank compensation structures lacked consistent principles

and tended to result in a compensation system that was all 'upside'.

18.17 CUTS IN OFFICIAL SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES

In the first instance, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England made a series of interest-rate cuts that led

to record low short-term interest rates in the two economies. !e Federal Reserve reduced the Federal Funds

rate from 5.25% in June 2007 to a record low target range of 0 to 0.25% in December 2008, while the Bank of

England cut its rate from 5.25% in July 2007 to a mere 0.5% in March 2009.

!e interest-rate cuts seem to have had three roles:

i.

to reduce the interest payments of heavily indebted consumers and firms, which was especially

important in helping those with variable rate mortgages to continue to service their mortgage

payments;

ii.

to increase banks' profit margins which are positively related to the spread between short-term and

longer-term rates of interest;

iii. to stimulate consumer expenditure and economic activity.

!e cuts in short-term interest rates, particularly a(er the collapse of Lehman Brothers, were unprecedented

in size – the **UK base rate** - f 0.5% was the lowest in the history of the Bank of England which had started

- perations in 1694, and the indicative range of 0–0.25% of the Federal Reserve was its lowest ever **Federal**
**Funds rate** (see Table 18.6).

18.18 LIQUIDITY PROVISION

As the financial markets froze, many banks found it very di'cult to raise money by issuing short-term

commercial paper, to borrow from other banks on the interbank markets or even to find buyers for some of

their assets. !e shortage of liquidity was exacerbated by the phenomenon of 'liquidity hoarding' whereby

banks decided to hoard whatever liquidity they had to ensure they could see themselves through the crisis.

So central banks stepped in to buy many of the securities that banks and other financial intermediaries were

attempting to sell. !is was in some ways merely fulfilling their traditional duty as 'lender of the last resort',

but the sheer size of the liquidity injections was unprecedented in scale. Also, the central banks increased the

maturity of the lending and the range of assets that they were prepared to accept as collateral for providing

liquidity. For instance, the US Treasury in September and December 2007 increased the term of loans it

allowed through its discount window and in March 2008 agreed to accept less liquid securities such as MBSs

as collateral for loans. Following the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 the US Treasury created a primary

dealer credit facility so that **primary dealers** could gain access to Federal Reserve facilities. In addition, the

Federal Reserve set up a temporary arrangement to ensure unlimited liquidity for Fannie Mae and Freddie

Mac if required.

495

International Finance

In April 2008 the Bank of England introduced a Special Liquidity Scheme (SLS) for eligible financial

institutions to swap less liquid securities for UK Treasury bills. !e SLS was extensively used in its nine-month

existence – to the tune of £185 billion. In May 2008 the Bank of England raised the ceiling on the deposits

that banks were allowed to hold at the Bank of England from 1% of sterling eligible liabilities or £1 billion,

whichever was higher, to 2.5% of eligible liabilities or £5 billion – more than doubling the amount lenders could

hold on deposit at the Bank of England. Lenders use the facility because it provides them with risk-free interest,

at the same time as giving them instant access to the funds. In the USA, on 18 September 2008, following the

bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the rescue of AIG, the Federal Reserve agreed to a \$180 billion expansion

- f its temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the Bank of Canada, Swiss National Bank,
Bank of England, Bank of Japan and European Central Bank. !is increased capacity, ensuring that these
central banks would have su'cient dollar funding for both short-term and overnight operations.

In sum, central banks increased liquidity by providing large increases in the funds they provided, by

extending the maturity of their credit operations, significantly expanding the range of eligible collateral as

well as the list of counterparties to include broker-dealers and special swap facilities allowing participants

to temporarily swap their high quality mortgage-backed and other securities for highly liquid government

bills and bonds. Finally, an increase in swap lines between central banks ensured that central banks and their

counterparties had su'cient access to foreign currency liquidity.

18.19 QUANTITATIVE EASING

Traditionally, central banks intervene through open market operations to in$uence short-term interest rates,

as outlined earlier. During the credit crunch short-term interest rates reached record lows. However, during

the crisis they also became concerned about the relatively elevated levels of long-term interest rates facing

corporations, and thus engaged in a new practice of 'credit easing' as it was called in the USA, or **quantitative**

**easing** as it was called in the UK. !e basic idea of quantitative easing was to purchase existing government

and even corporate/mortgage backed bonds from financial institutions and market participants with the hope

- f raising their prices and thereby lowering the yields on such assets. Another motive of quantitative easing
was to avert the risk of de$ation; that is, a period of falling consumer prices as a result of excess capacity
and rising unemployment rates that were occurring in the real economy as a result of the crisis. Finally,
another hope of quantitative easing was that the increased cash holdings of the banks would encourage them
to increase lending to consumers and businesses, so easing the effects of the credit crunch.

An important aspect of the quantitative easing policy is the expectation that purchases of longer-term

securities would be accompanied by an increase in the monetary base and a lowering of longer-term interest

rates, as the additional demand for the longer-term securities raised their prices and thus lowered their yield.

However, since quantitative easing effectively involves the printing of new money it also brings with it the

potential to raise in$ation expectations and in$ation risk premiums, so that in the mediumto long-term it

could actually raise longer-term yields rather than lower them. !e in$ationary dangers of quantitative easing

ultimately depend on the amount of quantitative easing and whether it creates a permanent or temporary

increase in the monetary base. In the UK the Bank of England set aside £375 billion for quantitative easing, and

in the USA some \$3,800 billion was set aside for asset purchases under its QE1, QEII and QEIII programmes.

When the European Central Bank announced in May 2009 that it would undertake a policy of credit easing to

the tune of &60 billion of covered euro bonds (mostly backed by mortgage repayments), the ECB subsequently

undertook further asset purchase as a result of the so-called PIIGS eurozone crisis. Japan also announced

an unprecedented quantitative easing program of its own in April 2013 in a bid to kick-start in$ation in its

monetary base over a less than two-year period.

Since these initial rounds of quantitative easing there have been continued instances of further quantitative

easing caused by the Covid-19 crisis which started to unsettle financial markets in March 2020. !e response

- f many governments including the USA and UK was to finance further massive increases in their fiscal
deficits through further asset purchases of central banks. !e European Central Bank also pursued a
vigorous quantitative easing programme in response to the crisis leading to a further rapid expansion of
its own balance sheet. Figure 18.3 shows how the balance sheet of these three central banks have expanded

since 2007.

18.20 FISCAL STIMULUS

Another response involved the extensive use of fiscal stimulus packages to try to cushion the effects of the

credit crunch on the real economy. In the USA a combination of economic stimulus packages increased

government expenditure and tax concessions, which resulted in a rise in the fiscal deficit from 2.1% of GDP in

2007 to 13.6% of GDP in 2009. Initially, under President Bush, the economic stimulus package was relatively

muted. In February 2008 a \$168 billion economic stimulus package was announced, consisting mainly of tax

cuts and rebates.

497

International Finance

On 10 February 2009 the Obama administration passed a \$789 billion economic ‘recovery package’ made

up of \$502 billion of expenditure and \$287 billion of tax relief, with a plan to spend 70% of it within the

first two years. !ere was a noticeable change in the stimulus packages offered by the two administrations.

!e initial Bush plan based on tax cuts was not deemed to be a great success because much of the tax

cuts and rebates were just saved or used to pay down debt rather than increase expenditure. As a result,

President Obama’s much larger stimulus package aimed to directly boost aggregate demand through

government expenditure on infrastructure. On 9 November 2009 China announced a \$586 billion stimulus

package equivalent to nearly 15% of its GDP. Even the European Union agreed a &200 billion package,

which was around 1.5% of its GDP, on 12 January 2009. On 24 November 2008 the UK announced a £25.6

billion stimulus plan, including a temporary cut in value-added tax (VAT) from 18.5% to 15%. Germany

announced a &31 billion stimulus package in November 2008, followed by a &50 billion plan in February

2009; while Japan presented a \$50)billion stimulus package in October 2008 and a further \$150 billion

package in April 2009.

!e net result of the bank bailout packages, economic recession and economic stimulus packages was a

massive increase in the actual and projected fiscal deficits and corresponding increases in the national debt,

especially in countries like the USA and the UK. Table 18.7 shows the actual fiscal deficits and the rising

national debt for the USA, UK, Japan and Germany for 2007–10.

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

18.21 BAILOUTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

_The US response_

Although the economic stimulus packages were among the biggest ever undertaken, their scale was

dwarfed by the amount of funds used to bail out the financial sector through capital injections and

guarantees. !e US set the ball rolling when a \$700 billion **Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)** was

passed, allowing the US Treasury to buy up or insure up to \$700 billion of troubled assets (primarily

residential and commercial mortgage-related securities issued prior to 14 March 2008) from the banking

and financial sector. !e aim was to provide some liquidity and pricing to these securities, which had

proved very di'cult to trade following the onset of the crisis. Any bank selling securities to the TARP was

expected to grant the government warrants, equity or senior debt to the Treasury, giving the taxpayer some

potential upside should the bank's shares recover. !e first \$350 billion was released on 3 October 2008

and the second instalment of \$350 billion on 15 January 2009. On 14 October 2008 there was a change

in the TARP, enabling the Treasury to buy senior preferred shares and warrants in the banks under a

Capital Partnership Programme (CPP). Subsequent changes to the TARP permitted the funds to be used to

enhance consumer credit and mitigate the financial crisis more generally, thus enabling TARP funds to be

allocated to bailing out the big three car makers, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. In February 2009 the

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced that \$50 billion of TARP funds would be used to mitigate

mortgage foreclosures.

On 25 November 2008 the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) was announced by the

Federal Reserve, enabling financial institutions to borrow funds to purchase distressed securities. Under the

scheme some \$200 billion (later changed to \$1 trillion) of funds was made available to holders of certain

AAA-rated ABSs on a non-recourse basis. A non-recourse loan is a loan secured against collateral but for

which the borrower is not responsible if he defaults; the lender can seize the collateral but he cannot chase

the borrower if the collateral is insu'cient to cover the value of the loan. !e idea of the TALF was to

inject liquidity into the ABS market, which was viewed as important in financing consumer credit and small

business loans.

On 23 March 2009 a Public-Private Investment Program (P-PIP) was established to use $75–$100 billion

- f TARP funds to buy troubled legacy loans and securities in conjunction with the private sector. !e
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would make non-recourse loan guarantees for up to 85% of the
purchase price, effectively limiting private market participants' possible loss to 15% of the price paid for
the securities. It was envisaged that the P-PIP would lead to the purchase of some \$500 billion of troubled
assets in total.

Another part of the policy response was the takeover or purchase of stakes in some of America's bestknown financial institutions. In particular, the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which

had combined assets totalling \$5.5 trillion on 7 September 2008, was pivotal, and merely a confirmation of

the widely held view that they were too big to fail. !e government’s takeover of AIG on 16 September 2008

due to losses on its CDSs was instigated because AIG was deemed both too big and too complex to be allowed

to fail on top of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. !e bailout of AIG totalled over \$180 billion, and was also

important because the government made good on \$93 billion of CDS contracts that it had entered into with

Goldman Sachs (\$12.9 billion), Société Générale (\$11.9 billion), Deutsche Bank (\$11.8 billion) and Barclays

(\$8.5 billion). If the US Treasury had not honoured those contracts then these institutions would have been

in much greater di'culty.

18.22 BANK STRESS TESTS

Following the Lehman Brothers' collapse in August 2008, governments decided that the way forward to

reassure investors and market participants was that banks would be subject to stress tests by their regulators.

In February 2009 the US government announced that the 19 largest US banks would be subject to 'stress tests'

by the Federal Reserve to see if they could survive a 'worst case scenario' consisting of 8.9% unemployment

in 2009 rising to 10.3% by 2010, a further 22% fall in property prices and a fall in real GDP of 3.2% in 2009

with only 0.5% growth in 2010. !e results of the stress tests were announced on 7 May 2009, with 10 of the

19 banks being required to raise \$74.9 billion of new capital by November 2009. In the event of a failure to

raise the capital then the banks would get the required capital from the US government in return for equity

stakes. It was made clear to market participants before the tests that further bank failures among the top 19

would not be permitted.

!e basic idea behind a stress test is to see if a bank has enough capital to survive a range of pre-specified

unfavourable economic scenarios (such as a prolonged recession) and other adverse developments (such as a

collapse in house prices or a large fall in equities and/or bond prices). !e aim of stress tests is both to assure

investors in banks that the bank is not at risk of failure and also to encourage or require banks to set aside

enough capital and/or raise new capital and/or change their business operations so as to ensure that they can

survive in di'cult times. !e results of stress tests have implications _inter alia_ for capital raising, management

- f bank assets, distribution of dividends, bonuses and pay and whether to take more or less risk in their
business operations.

Prior to the financial crisis banks had done stress tests on themselves but mainly as part of their internal

risk management based management (IRBM). However, following the financial crisis, regulators in the US,

UK and Europe have since moved to a regime of annual stress tests for major banks under their jurisdiction.

Banking regulators use the results of tests as a tool to spot potential systemic risk and to assess which banks

have su'cient capital to survive a financial crisis and which are likely to be most at risk were a crisis to occur.

Since October 2012 the US regulators have required American banks to undergo stress tests twice per

year – one internal and one conducted by the regulators. !ese annual tests are part of the Comprehensive

Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) which post-2010 are applicable to all US based banks with more than

\$50 billion in assets. !e tests are carried out by the Federal Reserve. In its June 2016 tests on 33 banks

covering 80% of US banking assets, all passed without censure except Morgan Stanley and the US subsidiaries

- f Santander and Deutsche Bank. !ose banks passing the stress test are able to pay dividends and buy back
stock from their shareholders. !e Federal Reserve stated in a press release of 23 June 2016:

!e most severe hypothetical scenario projects that loan losses at the 33 participating bank holding

companies would total \$385 billion during the nine quarters tested. !e 'severely adverse' scenario

features a severe global recession with the domestic unemployment rate rising five percentage points,

accompanied by a heightened period of financial stress, and negative yields for short-term U.S. Treasury

securities.

!e report noted that the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, which compares high-quality capital

to risk-weighted assets, would fall from an actual 12.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to a minimum level of

8.4% in the hypothetical adverse stress scenario.

In the case of the UK, the stress tests are carried out by the Prudential Regulation Authority which is a

part of the Bank of England in conjunction with the Financial Policy Committee which was formed in April

500

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

2013. In its November 2015 report covering seven major UK banks, it found that based on their balance
sheets at end-2014, five of the banks (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society
and Santander UK) were fine but the Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered needed to boost their
capital adequacy ratios.

In the case of the EU, stress tests are coordinated by the European Banking Association in cooperation

with the European Systemic Risk Board, the European Commission and relevant national authorities. Its July

2016 review of 51 European banks from 15 countries was different than previous reviews, since rather than

apply simple pass–fail criteria, it reported that the process would instead inform supervisors' ongoing review

- f banks and guide their efforts to maintain capital in the system and support the ongoing repair of balance
sheets. !e test revealed that the EU banking sector had significantly shored up its capital base with Core
Equity Tier 1 capital position for the stress test sample of 13.2% at the end-2015, some 2% higher than in 2014
and 4% higher than in 2011. In the European case, it should be noted that the tests were criticized)for)excluding
both Greek and Portuguese banks from the process and also failing to give a pass or fail to each bank.

Criticisms of stress tests include their failure to incorporate major possible events such as sovereign defaults

- r the emergence of negative interest rates for a sustained period of time which threaten bank profitability.
!ere is also the risk that banks will game the stress tests so they are able to survive the stress scenarios
presented to them by their regulators but not other crises that could easily occur. To some extent this problem
can be overcome by changing the adverse scenario each test time. !ere are also large costs for banks involved
in stress tests which are resource-intensive exercises involving extensive senior management and board-level

engagement.

18.23 REGULATORY RESPONSE

Not surprisingly given the extent of the financial crisis, the bailout costs to the taxpayer and impact on

governments' fiscal deficits and national debts and a strong desire to prevent future crises, there was a strong

regulatory response to the financial crisis at both the national and international level.

At the international level the Bank of International Settlements set up a Financial Stability Board in April

2009 to start the process of formulating Basel III to replace the Basel II Accord which had clearly failed to

prevent the financial crisis. !e main elements of Basel III are increased capital requirements, a new liquidity

ratio and greater reserves being required from Structurally Important Financial Institutions. In the UK the

Financial Services Authority which had been regulating the banking sector since 1998 was disbanded and its

regulatory function returned to the Bank of England. !e US Congress also enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in July 2010 which is the most comprehensive regulatory reform

- f the banking sector since the 1930s – see Box 18.5.

**Box 18.5 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act**

In response to the financial crisis and a desire to reduce the risk of a future financial crisis, congress

passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in July 2010. It was named

a(er its sponsors Christopher Dodd and Barney Frank and totalling some 2,300 pages it is by far the

most extensive set of regulatory reforms. !e Act established a number of new government agencies

tasked with implementing the act and overseeing the banking sector. !e aims of the act were

501

International Finance

(i))to)make)the)financial system more transparent and less risky and more accountable; (ii) to prevent

financial institutions from becoming 'too big to fail'; (iii) to protect consumers from risky behaviour,

abuse and losses from financial institutions; (iv) to end costly government bailouts of financial

institutions; and (v) to end risky and abusive financial practices by brokers and financial institutions.

!e Act established a number)of new government agencies tasked with implementing the Act and

  - verseeing the banking)sector.

!e Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA)

were set up to monitor the financial stability of major banks and to provide for firm liquidations or

restructuring through an Orderly Liquidation Fund (OLF). !e FSOC also has powers to break up

large banks that are deemed to pose systemic risks or require them to hold larger reserves. !e OLF

provides funds to assist with the restructuring and dismantling of financial companies that have been

placed into receivership and prohibits the use of taxpayer money for such purposes. In the light of the

failure of AIG, a Federal Insurance O'ce was set up to monitor large insurance companies that were

deemed 'too big to fail'.

!e Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was set up to crack down on predatory lending

and to ensure consumers better understood the terms of a mortgage loan before taking out a mortgage.

It restricts the commissions that can be earned by mortgage brokers on higher fee and/or interest rate

mortgages. It also prevents mortgage originators from steering potential borrowers to the loan that

will result in a higher fee payment for the originators. !e CPFB also has powers over other types of

consumer lending such as credit and debit cards requiring information given to consumers to be easy

to understand and charges made clear.

!e SEC O'ce of Credit Ratings was also set up to oversee the credit rating agencies that were

viewed as contributing to the financial crisis by having given unduly favourable ratings to mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations. !e role of the O'ce is to ensure that the ratings

agencies improve the accuracy of their ratings of the various business and securities that they evaluate.

A key element of the Dodd-Frank Act is the so-called 'Volker rule' (Article VI) which restricts the

ways commercial banks can invest and severely limits their ability to do proprietary trading. It also

makes it far harder for deposit accepting institutions such as commercial banks to conduct speculative

trading positions. In addition, there are heavy restrictions on their dealings with and exposure to risktaking market players such as hedge funds and private equity. !e effect of the Volker rule is to restore

the distinction between commercial banks and investment banks, making it far harder for financial

institutions to use their commercial banking deposit base to finance the speculative activities of their

investment banks. !e Volker rule also regulates financial firms' use of derivatives so as to reduce the

risk of a large financial institution taking large positions that could endanger the financial system.

!e Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions relating to derivatives, especially in relation to the

Credit Default Swap market. Since the CDS market is primarily an OTC market, the massive growth of

the market and the counterparty risk shown by the failure of AIG led to the Dodd-Frank Act requiring

the setting up of centralized exchanges for swaps trading and to improve information and transparency

with the aim of reducing the risk of counterparty default. !e Dodd-Frank Act also made it easier and

financially rewarding for whistleblowers to expose wrongdoing by financial institutions with a bounty

programme under which whistleblowers could receive 10% to 30% of the proceeds from a litigation

settlement. It increased from 90 to 180 days the statute of limitations under which a whistleblower can

bring forward a claim against an employer.

502

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

While the Dodd-Frank Act deals with many key issues resulting from the financial crisis, it is not

without criticism. One is the huge regulatory costs involved in implementing 225 new rules across a total

  - f 11 Federal agencies, but compared to the overall cost of the financial crisis these costs are somewhat
small. !ere is some concern that the Act, by limiting banks' ability to take speculative and marketmaking trading positions in securities such as government bonds, will mean a drying up of liquidity.
!is increases the chances of more abrupt price movements, making it di'cult for institutions to do
large trades in securities during periods of financial stress. !e higher reserve requirement on banks
and financial institutions will also restrict their ability to lend money to the private sector which will
additionally hit investment and economic growth. Some commentators argue that the over-regulation

  - f the American financial system will put their financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage
vis-à-vis their international competitors.

18.24 THE UK RESPONSE

!e UK's response to the financial crisis was initially much tougher than that of the USA. !e first institution

requiring a bailout was Northern Rock, which in September 2007 was facing a bank run. !e government

initially failed to make any guarantee to protect depositors beyond the statutory commitment to protect the

first £20,000. However, as queues formed outside bank branches, the Bank of England was forced to step

in as lender of last resort and guarantee all Northern Rock deposits. Eventually, in February 2008, when it

became clear that Northern Rock was unable to refinance itself, the bank was nationalized and its shares

became worthless. Another nationalization took place on 28 September 2008 when the government took over

Bradford & Bingley's £50 billion mortgage and loan book and sold off its branch network to Spanish banking

group Santander.

!e full extent of the crisis in British banking really became apparent when the government was forced

to bail out the largest bank in the UK, the Royal Bank of Scotland (which included the well-known NatWest

franchise), and the newly merged Lloyds TSB and HBOS banks. On 8 October 2008, in what Robert Peston,

the BBC business editor, characterized as 'perhaps the most extraordinary day in British banking history',

the UK government announced an unprecedented £500 billion bank rescue scheme. !e main aims of the

scheme were to restore market confidence and to stabilize the British banking system. !e package provided

for £200 billion of short-term loans through the Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme, £250 billion of

government guarantees on interbank lending and up to £50 billion of state investment in the UK banking

sector. Two major banks took part in the Bank Recapitalisation Fund scheme, the Royal Bank of Scotland

(RBS) and Lloyds TSB with its new acquisition, HBOS. RBS took £20 billion with £5 billion in preference

shares and £15 billion in ordinary shares, giving the government a 60% holding, while Lloyds TSB-HBOS took

£17 billion with £8.5 billion in preference shares and £8.5 billion in ordinary shares, giving the government a

40% holding. On 6 March 2009, a(er it became clear that the HBOS losses were far bigger than expected, the

British government announced a further injection which increased its stake in Lloyds TSB to 65%, or 77%

including non-voting preference shares.

Despite its huge scale, the October 2008 bailout was not su'cient to stabilize the British banking system

- r the UK financial markets. !erefore, on 19 January 2009 the government announced a second bank rescue
package designed to increase the ability of British banks to lend to business and their customers. !e January
package was made up of an initial £50 billion of funds which were available for large corporates and an Asset

503

International Finance

Protection Scheme (APS), an insurance scheme designed to limit participating UK banks' future losses on

their 'toxic assets'. On 26 February 2008 the basic idea of the scheme was announced by the UK Treasury. In

return for an insurance premium, participating banks would be able to insure a large part of their loan books

against future losses. RBS announced its intention to participate in the scheme in respect of £325 billion

- f assets, paying a participation fee of £6.5 billion (in the form of B shares giving the Treasury the right to
dividends but not voting rights) to the Treasury in capital and agreeing to bear a first loss of up to £19.5 billion.
As part of the deal RBS agreed to make 2009 lending commitments totalling £25 billion comprising £9 billion

- f mortgage lending and £16 billion of business lending. For its part the UK Treasury made a capital injection
- f £13 billion into RBS and made a commitment to subscribe for an additional £6 billion at RBS's option. !e
- ther major participant was Lloyds-HBOS, which on 27 March 2009 announced an agreement with the UK
Treasury to place £260 billion of assets into the APS for a participation fee of £15.6 billion with the bank being
responsible for a first loss of £25 billion. As part of the deal Lloyds-HBOS agreed to make additional lending
commitments totalling £14 billion over the following year comprising £3 billion of mortgage lending and
£11)billion of business lending.

**Box 18.5 The nationalizations of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley**

!e concept of nationalization was becoming a distant memory for many British citizens, with some of

the last major nationalizations being the car company British Leyland in 1976 and the Bank of England

rescue of Johnson Matthey Bank in 1984. An even more distant event was a bank run – one had not

  - occurred in Britain since 1866. However, the credit crunch reintroduced the British public to both
concepts with the nationalizations of its third largest mortgage lender Northern Rock (6,000 employees)
in February 2008, followed by its eighth largest mortgage provider Bradford & Bingley (3,200 employees)
in October 2008.

!e reasons for the problems at Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley were somewhat different

from subprime mortgage losses that created havoc with the US banking system. !e seeds for the demise

  - f the two institutions dated back to legislation, passed by the !atcher government in 1986, enabling
building societies to become banks. Northern Rock took advantage of the legislation in October 1997
and Bradford & Bingley in December 2000. !e principal problem for both companies was the funding
mechanism that they used to finance the expansion of their mortgage books. Traditionally, banks and
building societies funded their mortgage books by using their customers' deposits. However, with
their new-found bank status, both organizations borrowed money, quite a lot of it short-term from
international financial markets, to supplement their deposit-based funding in order to aggressively
grow their mortgage businesses. !e business model was badly disrupted by the subprime crisis when
interbank lending dried up and the banks could not roll over their short-term paper as the credit markets
froze. Both banks also made the mistake of increasing their mortgage business by aggressively lending
high amounts of mortgage compared to property values, o(en requiring little or even no deposit from
borrowers. Bradford & Bingley was particularly aggressive in lending to landlords in the 'buy-to-let'
market, o(en requiring only self-certification of their income.

A bank run on the Northern Rock bank started on 14 September 2007 a(er the bank announced that

it was seeking emergency assistance from the Bank of England. !is sparked queues of its customers to

form outside its branches and three days later the Bank of England, afraid that other banks might face a

bank run, decided to step in to guarantee all deposits at the bank. During the next few months)Northern

504

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

Rock's share price continued to fall and attempts to find a private buyer failed. On 22 February 2008

Northern Rock was nationalized. Bradford & Bingley became increasingly exposed as speculators

realized that its funding model was similar to that of Northern Rock. Despite initial denials that it needed

new capital, the bank was forced to raise £400 million in June 2008. However, this was not su'cient to

restore confidence in the bank and it was nationalized on 29 September 2008 a(er customers started to

queue to withdraw their money and it became clear it could not roll over its short-term debt. Bradford

& Bingley's mortgage business was taken over by the government and its branches and deposits were

taken over by the Spanish bank, Santander Group.

!e nationalization of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley required Acts of Parliament, as

well as permission from the European Commission whose competition rules generally forbid direct

state support for a company. As a result of the nationalizations the British government injected

£25)billion)into)Northern Rock and £8.2 billion into Bradford & Bingley. !e nationalizations meant

the government had a mortgage book exposure totalling £140 billion (£90 billion from Northern Rock

and £50 billion from Bradford & Bingley) at the end of 2008. !e investment in Northern Rock and

Bradford and Bingley was managed by UK Financial Investments (UKFI) which itself ceased trading on

31 March 2018, with its assets transferred to UK Government Investments, a limited company wholly

  - wned by HM Treasury.

_Other countries' responses_

While US and UK banks were the most heavily affected by the credit crunch, the crisis had severe impacts on

- ther countries' banking systems. German banks had bought US subprime-related securities and were heavily
impacted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but had also overlent to Eastern Europe. On 6 October 2008,
the German government was forced to step in with a &50 billion rescue of Hypo Real Estate (HRE), taking a
90% stake in return for its capital injection. HRE's viability was threatened when its Irish-based subsidiary
bank Depfra faced severe funding problems following the Lehman Brothers collapse. As it became apparent
that more German banks were facing problems, on 17 October 2008 the German government announced
a &500 billion Special Fund for Financial Market Stabilization, with \$400 billion available for guaranteeing
interbank loans, \$80 billion available for capital injections and &20 billion set aside to cover potential losses.
In January 2009 the German government also set aside &100 billion for guarantees and loans to assist German
companies adversely affected by the recession.

On 27 September 2008, Fortis, a European banking and insurance group, was rescued through a partnationalization, surrendering a 49% stake in return for a capital injection of &11.2 billion from the central

banks of Belgium (&4.7 billion), Netherlands (&4 billion) and Luxembourg (&2.5 billion). !e bank had made

major losses through taking a &24 billion stake in the Dutch bank ABN Amro, which had huge losses on its

books following its subprime exposures. A few days later on 30 September 2008 Dexia Bank was rescued by

the Belgian, Dutch and French governments with a &6.4 billion package. Another country drawn, perhaps

inevitably, into the crisis given its well-established banking sector was Switzerland. !e Swiss banking

sector had a reputation for conservative banking principles and secrecy. However, it seems that during the

boom years its two largest investment banks, the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and Credit Suisse, had

departed from this tradition of cautious money management. In particular, UBS under former Chairman

505

International Finance

Marcel Ospel had set itself the goal of becoming the world's number one investment bank. In so doing it had

abandoned its traditionally conservative strategies to leap into US subprime-backed investments and other

high-risk instruments. In particular, its hedge fund Dillon Read Capital had built up a large exposure to the

US subprime mortgage sector. As credit-related losses mounted to over \$40 billion and worried depositors

withdrew tens of billions of dollars from the bank, on 17 October the Swiss National Bank (SNB) stepped

in with a \$59.2 billion rescue package made up of a \$5.3 billion capital injection and a commitment to buy

\$53.9 billion of UBS securities and assets to be transferred to a separate entity controlled by the SNB. Credit

Suisse decided to seek capital from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Qatar Investment Authority which injected

\$8.75 billion of capital.

Two of the more surprising countries to be heavily drawn into the crisis were Ireland and Iceland. !e

Irish economy had boomed for many years and property prices had risen more dramatically in Ireland than

in any other country. !e trouble was that the Irish banks became heavily exposed to the property market and

property developers, so that when house prices began to fall the Irish economy went into a steep recession.

On 2 October 2008 following a run by depositors, the Irish government announced that it would protect all

deposits in its six largest banks, a protection guarantee in the region of &400 billion. In December the Irish

government announced that it would pump &7.7 billion into three of its largest banks, taking control of Anglo

Irish Banking group with a 75% stake. In the end even that proved insu'cient to save Anglo Irish Bank which

was nationalized in January 2009. In April 2009 the IMF estimated that the Irish bank bailouts would be

equivalent to 13.9% of Ireland's GDP, or &24 billion.

In the case of Iceland, a small country with a mere 300,000 population, its banks had grown dramatically

since 2000 and had combined assets equivalent to eight times its GDP. !e massive expansion of its banks

was financed by borrowing in foreign currencies, so when the Icelandic crown started to collapse the

viability of its banks became questionable. In late September 2008 the Icelandic government took a 75%

controlling interest in its third largest bank Glitner, with a &600 million capital injection, as it became clear

the bank was on the brink of collapse. In October 2008 it was forced to step in and rescue three of its largest

banks. One of its banks, Icesave, a subsidiary of Landsbanki, had attracted significant deposits of up to

£5)billion from the UK. When its accounts were frozen there were major problems for British companies,

local authorities and individual depositors that held accounts with Icesave. In the end Iceland had to go

to the IMF for an emergency \$2.1 billion loan, with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark lending an

additional \$2.5 billion.

18.25 FINES

A final aspect of dealing with the credit crunch was fines for financial institutions involved in bringing

about the crisis in the first place. !e objective of the fines was partly to punish the financial institutions

for mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities and CDOs by deliberately understating the risks involved, to

raise money for taxpayers and the regulators that incurred costs investigating the crisis, to encourage future

better behaviour on the part of financial institutions and also to provide some consumer relief for financial

institutions and investors that bought the mis-sold securities.

!e US Department of Justice (DoJ) reached out-of-court settlements in relation to the mis-selling of

mortgage-backed securities totalling over \$70 billion by December 2016. !e largest fine was imposed on

Bank of America (\$16.65 billion), JP Morgan Chase (\$13 billion), Deutsche Bank (\$7.2 billion), Citigroup

(\$7)billion), Credit Suisse (\$5.28 billion), Goldman Sachs (\$5.1 billion), Morgan Stanley (\$3.6 billion), Wells

506

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

**Box 18.6 The total global cost of the credit crunch**

!e total costs of the credit crunch are impossible to calculate since we need to also know what would

have happened if there had not been a credit crunch. Furthermore, the boom that preceded the credit

crunch meant higher employment and higher tax revenues for governments that to some extent helped

to offset the lower levels of employment and tax revenues that followed the onset of the credit crunch. In

its April 2009 report the IMF estimated that banks faced \$2.5 trillion in losses between 2007 and 2010,

insurers \$300 billion and other financial institutions \$1.3 trillion, a total of \$4.1 trillion.

In July 2009 the IMF put the cost of government support packages at over \$10 trillion, with

rich countries providing \$9.2 trillion of support for the financial sector and emerging economies

\$1.6)trillion.)Of this, some \$1.9 trillion is upfront costs and the remainder is made up of guarantees and

loans. !e financial bailout costs include:

|Capitalinjections|\$11trillion<br>.|
|---|---|
|Purchase of assets|\$1.9 trillion|
|Guarantees|\$4.6 trillion|
|Liquidity provision|\$2.5 trillion|

!e fiscal and financial costs of the policy response to the credit crunch are given in Table 18.8.

Fargo (\$1.2 billion) with Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland deciding not to settle with the DoJ and

argue their case in the US court system. !e size of the fines re$ected the seriousness of the financial crisis

and scale of mis-selling of securities. Although banks usually pay the fines over a prolonged period of time the

size of the settlements has eroded their capital bases meaning the need to raise new capital, sell off some assets

and restricting their ability to pay dividends to their shareholders and lend new funds to potential borrowers.

Against this the sheer scale of the financial crisis, the hit to government finances and the misery caused to

millions of homeowners and the rise in unemployment need to be considered.

18.26 THE COVID-19 CRISIS AND THE IMPACT ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE

GLOBAL ECONOMY

In 2019 the global economy was well into the recovery phases of the global financial crisis and European

economies seemed to have overcome the problems of the PIIGS crisis. Unemployment rates were at record

lows in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the IMF was forecasting global economic growth of

4% for 2020. However, the biggest shock since the Second World War was about to hit the global economy.

A mysterious virus believed to have its origins in a market based in the Chinese city of Wuhan was initially

downplayed as a major threat by both the Chinese government and the World Health Organisation. However,

during January and February 2020 evidence emerged that the virus was potentially lethal and highly

transmissible from person to person and had started to spread across the world at an exponential rate. As

evidence emerged of the rapid spread of the virus and rising hospital admissions, followed by a noticeable

increase in deaths, the WHO declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.

!e reaction of the financial markets was rather swi( and there was a sharp fall in global equities across the

globe. As evidence about the highly transmissible nature of Covid-19 and its potential to overwhelm countries'

health care systems emerged, governments were forced to respond by instigating significant lockdowns of

their economies. !is meant the temporary closure of restaurants, hotels, sports events and non-essential

retail, and major disruption to the airline industry with $ight tra'c down by over 90% in some countries with

large restrictions on international travel. With rapidly rising unemployment and fear of a global depression

the response of governments and central banks was swi( and unprecedented in scale. Governments across

Europe introduced furlough schemes to support millions of employees who were not able to work, and there

was direct and indirect aid to business in the form of direct state aid, tax concessions and business loans to help

see them through the pandemic. !e scale of the state intervention was unprecedented in the post-Second

World War era and meant both a huge increase in fiscal deficits and national debts in almost all economies.

!ere was an equally unprecedented response to the crisis from central banks with the Federal Reserve, Bank

- f England and European Central Bank engaging in further significant quantitative easing programmes to buy
the newly issued government debt, effectively monetizing most of the massive increase in fiscal expenditures.

!e result of the policies was to limit the immediate damage to the real economies and households but

there were nonetheless still very substantial falls in GDP and very large increases in fiscal deficits and national

debts as shown in Table 18.9. !e policies also had the effect of $ooding the financial markets leading to a

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

rapid recovery in global stock markets fuelled by record low interest rates and increased liquidity. Although

real GDPs fell substantially in many economies the US stock market actually rose year on year.

At the time of writing, infection rates were being brought under control and vaccines being deployed

which will help to bring an eventual end to the health crisis. Nonetheless, the roll-out of the vaccination

programme will be speedier in some countries than in others, making recovery from the Covid-19 crisis

uneven across countries and regions of the world. !ere can be no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has

been the largest global health and economic crisis since the Second World War and it will take many years

before the full economic and financial effects of the crisis become clear. !e fiscal and monetary implications

will weigh on economies for many years to come with no doubt some economies recovering more quickly

than others. !e increase in national debts, while a necessary response to the crisis, will need to be brought

under control over time by a mixture of government spending cuts and tax rises particularly on corporations

and wealthier taxpayers simply because the poorer sections of society have been most adversely affected by the

crisis and they have also been the most severely affected by job losses and ill-health. Whether Covid-19 will

sow the seeds of a future financial crisis remains to be seen; it has certainly reduced the room for manoeuvre

for governments should a future crisis emerge.

18.27 CONCLUSIONS

!e global financial crisis has many lessons for regulators, financial market participants, policy-makers and

financial institutions. More than a decade on, we now have a fuller understanding of the causes of the crisis and

lessons to be learnt but it will still take many years before we can properly assess the longer-term consequences

and appropriateness of the policy response. At the heart of the crisis was an unprecedented increase in debt

levels of the private sector, misunderstood, mis-sold, mispriced and mis-rated financial innovations, a housing

bubble and inadequate management of risk by banks, along with regulation that was too lax. !e credit rating

agencies also played a pivotal role because, had CDOs and MBSs been properly rated, there would have been

far less build-up of bad debt and the resulting losses would have been far lower.

One clear lesson for regulators is that they need to analyse and quantify systemic risk in the financial sector

in a much better way. While regulators were concentrating on looking at risks in individual institutions, the

build-up of systemic risk in the sector had clearly not been appreciated prior to the outbreak of the crisis.

Clearly, neither the regulatory authorities nor the banks had understood the linkages between the house price

bubble, financial innovation, the growth of leverage in the financial system and the degree of globalization of

the financial sector.

Another lesson is that prior to the outbreak of the crisis there had been too much focus on the capital

adequacy of banks and not enough focus on liquidity issues. Once the crisis began, the drying up of liquidity

- f many financial instruments made them virtually untradeable. For example, the secondary and new issuance
markets for CDOs and other MBSs virtually dried up at points during the credit crunch. In addition, many
financial institutions that were reliant on commercial paper or the interbank lending market for funding
found themselves in major financial di'culties when these sources of funding suddenly ceased to be available.
Many of the financial services intermediaries that failed during the crisis met capital adequacy requirements
but were unable to function due to a lack of liquidity. !is lack of liquidity meant that it became very hard to
establish the prices of the CDOs and MBSs which banks and financial institutions held on their trading books,
and in turn created uncertainty over banks' viability and share prices.

Another issue was the role played by the credit rating agencies. In retrospect, it is clear that the credit rating

agencies applied too high a credit rating to both banks and the securities that they were issuing. !e models

509

International Finance

that they were using to rate new financial products such as CDOs were faulty and underestimated the risks

involved. Without such high ratings the amount of securitization of subprime and other loans would have

been greatly reduced, as would have been the extent of the crisis. It should also be remembered that the credit

rating agencies were assigning a rating based on the potential for default. As such, they were not concerned

with the potential price risk and liquidity issues that investors that bought these instruments might confront.

Some argue that the credit rating agencies should be more heavily regulated, and there is certainly a need to

examine the potential for con$icts of interest on their part. In the run-up to the crisis it is estimated that over

40% of their revenues were being generated from rating structured finance products.

Improved data collection is needed when assessing banks. In particular, the growth of off-balance-sheet

exposures and risks in the form of SPVs and SIVs and other conduits undoubtedly contributed to the crisis.

In addition, the growth of leverage in the financial system was not fully recognized as a source of risk, when

it clearly should have been. Many investment banks and hedge funds were operating with leverage of 20 to 30

times their capital.

Another feature of the crisis was the extent to which it was concentrated in over-the-counter (OTC)

products such as swaps, CDOs, CDSs and the like in which there were significant counterparty risks, risks that

were heavily exposed by the Lehman bankruptcy and failure of AIG. By contrast, exchange traded products

such as futures and options continued to trade effectively throughout the crisis. Exchange traded products

are marked to market on a daily basis and initial and variation margin payments mean that the counterparty

risk is kept to a very low level. By contrast, since OTC instruments do not have such stringent margining

requirements, the risks and potential losses of a counterparty defaulting do not get fully recognized by market

participants until disaster strikes, as happened when both Lehman's and AIG got into di'culty. In the case of

Lehman Brothers, many banks and financial institutions were hit by its failure and suffered large losses due to

the counterparty failure. Further large losses would have been suffered by many banks had the US Treasury

not stepped in to honour the CDSs that AIG Financial Products Division had written. In response to this,

regulators have been encouraging greater transparency concerning bank exposures to OTC products and

encouraging exchanges to develop competing products with proper margining processes.

In retrospect, it seems that once the financial crisis began, some sound financial institutions got themselves

into di'culty by believing that it was an opportunity to expand their business franchise. RBS made a terrible

decision to take over ABN Amro in December 2007, Lloyds TSB acquired HBOS and Bank of America took

- ver Merrill Lynch. !ese takeovers proved disastrous for the acquiring companies since the banks they took
- ver had huge losses on their portfolios that were not fully appreciated at the time of the takeover.

Another issue is the relationship between compensation in the financial sector and profitability. It is clear that

the system of annual bonuses linked primarily to revenues and short-term profits created an incentive for traders

and financial institutions to take on too much risk so as to maximize short-term performance at the expense of

longer-term viability and returns. Many of the profits during the boom years were in fact 'illusory profits' on which

large salaries and bonuses were paid. In reality, many of the transactions at that time were to lead to unprecedented

future losses and destruction of shareholder and bond-holder wealth. Since the financial crisis the authorities have

enacted legislation restricting the size of bonuses payable and linking them to the longer-term performance of the

bank share price by preventing bankers cashing in their shares until a certain number of years have passed.

Tackling the moral hazard problem is an important and tricky issue following the crisis. Central banks

and Treasuries came to the rescue of the financial sector on an unprecedented scale. !is included massive

injections of liquidity into the system, cuts in short-term interest rates, financial support for bank mergers,

state guarantees on interbank loans, government guarantees on bank debt and state insurance limiting future

losses from the crisis. !e financial system was shown to be too important to be allowed to fail and the

problem is exacerbated by the fact that bankers now know that the state will intervene to rescue key financial

510

The Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 Pandemic

institutions if necessary. Since the financial crisis regulators have been trying to design a system and regulatory

infrastructure that encourages banks to avoid excessive risk-taking such as heavy restrictions on proprietary

trading and raising capital and liquidity ratios to make them more resilient against a future crisis.

!e regulators faced many hard questions following the global financial crisis; some commentators have

accused them of being 'asleep at the wheel'. !ey failed to recognize the build-up of risks in the system, and

generally failed to spot problems in the mortgage market and in the banks and investment houses that were

at the centre of the crisis. !ere were clearly problems of understa'ng, lack of expertise and a mistaken belief

that the banks were using sophisticated modelling techniques to manage their own risks effectively. !ere was

also a problem of coordination between different regulatory authorities. In the USA there are both Federal

and State regulations to be considered, while in the UK the FSA proved to be inept at regulation, and the

responsibility for banking regulation and supervision was returned to the Bank of England in 2010.

!ere has also been increased scrutiny at off-balance-sheet vehicles, such as SIVs and SPVs/SPEs that were

involved in the purchase of so many of the structured finance products where losses were heavily concentrated.

!e lack of transparency in banks' balance sheets prior to the outbreak of the crisis and the use of off-balancesheet vehicles meant that the build-up of systemic risk in the system was not properly recognized until the crisis

started. !e Basel I Accord required large US banks to maintain capital reserves equivalent to 8% of the riskadjusted assets while SPVs/SPEs were not required to hold such reserves. !is created an incentive for banks to

set up SPVs so as to minimize their need for capital reserves. !ere are clearly dangers in banks having both onbalance and off-balance-sheet structures, since the on-balance-sheet report can give a misleading impression of

financial stability when the real risks are hidden in off-balance-sheet SPVs/SPEs and SIVs. !e SIVs turned to

their sponsoring banks when they got into funding di'culties, and the parent banks had problems providing

the necessary liquidity. To some extent the Basel II Accord partially overcame this problem by requiring similar

capital reserves for SPVs. !e Basel III Accord increases bank balance sheet transparency by requiring them

to hold capital against their 'Total Exposure' which is the sum of both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet

exposures. Basel III also requires banks to expand the range of assets used to calculate the risk-weighted assets

(RWA) with much more emphasis being placed on off-balance-sheet liabilities and proprietary trading risks.

As well as raising capital requirements, the Basel III Accord also introduced liquidity requirements on banks.

!ese two measures proved prescient in the sense that they have enabled the financial system and banking

sector to withstand the Covid-19 shock to a much better extent than would have otherwise been the case.

!e longer-term consequences of the financial crisis for national debts, the roles of governments in the

economy, the regulatory system and the financial sector remain in a state of $ux more than a decade and a half

- n from the crisis. What is clear is that the policy response to the crisis meant that the taxpayer has ended up
assuming a significant part of the losses and the financial risks that the banks took on during the boom times.
In return, the public sector now has a significant stake in the form of equity or debt in many large and small
financial institutions. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG are now effectively controlled by the US government.
In Britain the taxpayer still holds a large stake in the RBS and a somewhat smaller stake in Lloyds TSB group,
combined with ownership of Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock.

Finally, the Covid-19 crisis came at a time when economies were close to overcoming many of the

problems raised by the global financial crisis. !is latest crisis has led to further massive quantitative easing,

large increases in fiscal deficits and national debts that will take many years to bring back under control. One

- f the main risks stemming from the Covid-19 crisis is that new money printing will likely finally end the era
- f low in$ation and any rise in in$ation could lead to an abrupt rise in longer-term rates of interest at a time
when governments, corporations and many households have record levels of debt. It will require great skill

- n the part of policy-makers to bring fiscal deficits back under control and ending their quantitative easing
programmes without hindering the economic growth that will be required to prevent the new levels of debt
from being the cause of future financial crises.
