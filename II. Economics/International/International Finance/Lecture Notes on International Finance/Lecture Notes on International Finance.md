# Preface

What is international macroeconomics and finance? Here is an answer I found by asking ChatGPT.

International macroeconomics and finance is a subfield of economics that deals with the economic interactions and relationships between countries. It includes the study of international trade, exchange rates, and the balance of payments, as well as the economic policies of governments and their impacts on international economic conditions.

In international macroeconomics and finance, economists and policymakers analyze how countries can achieve stability and prosperity in an increasingly interconnected global economy. They also study how economic events and policies in one country can affect other countries, and how countries can work together to address global economic challenges.

Some key issues in international macroeconomics and finance include trade liberalization, exchange rate regimes, capital flows, international financial crises, and economic development. It is an important area of study for policymakers, economists, and business leaders, as it helps them understand and navigate the complex economic interactions between countries.

A pretty impressive summary, right? In the narrower scope of this lecture note, we will focus on the following four types of issues that fall under the umbrella of international macroeconomics and finance.

First, we would like to understand the determinants of exchange rates and international asset prices. As with generic asset pricing, we would like to understand what drives exchange rates and international asset prices to fluctuate ex-post, what drives some currencies and assets to have higher expected returns ex-ante, and how to characterize the risk-return trade-off. The international asset prices include bond yields across countries, which, as we will see, are closely related to the currency market, as well as international equity prices, though they will receive much shallower coverage in this note.

Second, there is a quantity dimension, which includes capital flows, international portfolio positions and imbalances, as well as imports and exports of various goods. Another key agenda in international macroeconomics and finance is to connect these quantities

to the exchange rates and asset prices. We would like to understand how these quantities evolve between countries, sectors, and agents, and whether they share common drivers with exchange rate fluctuations.

Third, we also need to understand the roles played by monetary and fiscal policies in regulating and shaping the asset price and quantity dynamics. Besides the conventional interest rate policies and foreign exchange market interventions, unconventional monetary policies such as large scale asset purchases and sales have become very important and change our understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism. Moreover, the government debt and deficits have risen to unprecedented levels in the post-war history. The fiscal outlooks also shape how investors price the government liabilities including debt and currencies.

Finally, from a global perspective, we need to understand what constitutes the international monetary system, what makes it stable or unstable, where it comes from, and how it is going to evolve. Of particular interest is the asymmetric core-periphery structure suggested by exchange rates, capital flows and imbalances data. We would like to understand what enables the U.S. to currently occupy the central position, and how its centrality is shaping the financial markets.

A good understanding of these four levels of issues in international macroeconomics and finance helps us understand the world and design better policies and institutions. Pioneers in this field have thought about these issues throughout history. To motivate the issues that we study, let us consider some of my favorite historical episodes that bear economic significance for this research field.

First, consider the exchange rate fluctuations during the interbellum years. The left panel of Figure 1 plots the annual government surplus in billion local currency units. The U.K., France, and Germany all incurred fiscal deficits during and after the World War I. The U.K. had the most modest fiscal deficits, followed by France, and Germany had the largest deficits.

These large fiscal deficits were accompanied by dramatic currency depreciation. The right panel of Figure 1 plots these countries' nominal exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. All three currencies went off their pegs to the gold. In the cross-section, consistent with the U.K. running the smallest fiscal deficits, the U.K. pound depreciated the least. The French franc depreciated more than the U.K. pound, and the German mark depreciated the most. In the time series, after Germany introduced the new currency, the Reichsmark, in 1924, the exchange rate stabilized as the fiscal deficits were reduced.

These cross-sectional and time-series patterns suggest a strong

link between fiscal deficits and exchange rates. We will discuss this link in detail in Chapter 6. This period also witnessed the rise of the U.S. dollar as the dominant international currency and the transfer of international financial center from the U.K. to the U.S. We will discuss the financial hegemon and the architecture of the international monetary system in Chapter 7.

Second, consider the dollar exchange rate after the break-down of the Bretton Woods system in 1973. Before 1973, many foreign currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar at fixed exchange rates, which was in turn pegged to gold. As this system broke down, the exchange rates became floating. Figure 2 plots the trade-weighted real dollar index, which measures the strength of the U.S. dollar in real terms against a basket of foreign currencies weighted by their trade shares. We observe several periods of large and persistent dollar appreciation and depreciation. For example, the dollar depreciated by over  $25\%$  in the 70s after it was depegged from the gold, followed by appreciation by almost  $50\%$  in the early 80s aided by higher U.S. interest rates. Then, concerned about the dollar's strength, the U.S. and other major countries reached the Plaza Accord in 1985. They intervened the foreign exchange market to orchestrate dollar depreciation against the French franc, the German mark, the Japanese yen and, the British pound. The dollar appreciated again in the mid-90s, followed by dollar depreciation in early 2000s due to increased risk appetite for investing abroad. This run of dollar depreciation and capital outflows came to an end when the global financial crisis hit in 2008, which led to a flight to safety and dollar appreciation. The dollar depreciated after the panic subsided. Finally, the dollar experienced a decade-long appreciation since early 2010s, which lasted till this day.

While this is far from a complete account of the dollar's exchange rate movement, it begs two obvious questions. First, is there a systematic pattern in the dollar's exchange rate in relation to global crisis? Second, are there regime shifts in the main drivers of the dollar exchange rate? We will discuss these questions throughout this note.

Third, consider the evolution of sovereign bond yields in the Eurozone, which share the same currency denomination. Figure 3 plots the sovereign yields in different Eurozone countries, which shows three distinct regimes. First, before the global financial crisis in 2008, the yields were almost identical. Second, after the crisis, the yields diverged sharply as the European sovereign debt crisis unfolded. For example, Germany's and France's bond yields remained as low as  $2\%$  in early 2010s, whereas Italy's and Portugal's bond yields rose above  $10\%$ . Third, the yields converged again after 2015, possibly aided by the ECB bond purchase programs this time.

It turns out that these yield differentials are driven not only by the default spreads, which reflect the fact that different sovereign debt has different default probabilities and hence carries different risk premia, but also by the convenience yields, which we will discuss in Chapter 4. Moreover, the monetary and fiscal policies played important roles in shaping these yield differentials. We will discuss these issues in Chapter 6.

Finally, consider the net flows to the U.S. Treasury market. Figure 4 plots the annualized net flows into U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, and decomposes the flows into three components: domestic

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/4caa6424-992f-437c-ac5a-4f95ef04f006/51399a93ba5135edb4e0e6fb56f6b7eeafb80369df574075e8ba35a5467463a2.jpg)

investors, the Fed, and the rest of the world (ROW). We observe three different regimes. First, from the mid 1970s until the mid 1990s, the U.S. domestic agents, including the financial sector such as banks, insurance companies, pensions and the household sector, absorbed a significant fraction of the new debt issuance. They were the major players in the Treasury market, whereas the flows and the positions of the Fed and the ROW were relatively small.

There was a distinct shift in the mid-to-late 1990s, when the ROW became the main Treasury buyers while the domestic investors became net sellers. In this second regime through 2015, the ROW was by far the most important buyer of U.S. Treasuries. Their inflows were particularly pronounced during the global financial crisis, which is consistent with the flight to safety observed in safe dollar bond prices. The Fed also started playing a more active role since the global financial crisis, as it undertook quantitative easing and expanded its balance sheet.

Since 2015, we have entered a third regime characterized by weaker demand from the ROW. In fact, contrary to its countercyclical purchases of the U.S. Treasuries in previous decades, it became a net seller in the Treasury market during the Covid-19 crisis. In comparison, the Fed became a much more active buyer during the Covid-19 crisis. Bond purchases from the ROW re-emerged after the Covid-19 crisis, albeit smaller in magnitude than prior to 2015. In Chapters 7 and 9, we will discuss different approaches to understanding the cross-border asset allocations and the implications for the capital flows and exchange rates.

The goal of this note is to develop a coherent theoretical framework for understanding all these phenomena in international macroe

conomics and finance. That said, I do not mean to give the impression that all is known. Instead, much remains to be understood, and a lot is left out by this note. I hope this note offers curious readers a starting point for further exploration.

This note is organized by three parts: (1) introduction, (2) understanding exchange rates, and (3) understanding quantities and flows. In introduction, I start by building a benchmark two-country model of international business cycles that is a natural generalization of the standard closed-economy real business cycle model. This benchmark model offers a clear starting point, although it falls short in terms of explaining many stylized facts in the exchange rate and quantity data. Then, the part on exchange rates develops a series of extensions and modifications of the benchmark model that can help us understand the exchange rate dynamics. Building on this part, the part on quantities and flows further develops frameworks that can help us speak to the quantity dynamics.

In the course of working on this note, I have benefited from many discussions with my colleagues, coauthors, and friends. I am thankful to Xuning Ding, Jialu Sun, and Yudan Ying for their research assistance for related research projects. I am grateful for Ravi Jagannathan, Robert Korajczyk, and the William and Mary Breen Fund for funding support. All errors in this note are mine.

I assume that the readers have taken an entry-level graduate course in macroeconomics or asset pricing. I also assume that the readers are familiar with the basic tools in dynamic programming and (for a few sections) stochastic calculus. I will try to keep the math simple, and give priority to the development of intuitions.

So, welcome to the field of international macroeconomics and finance! I very much hope you enjoy the journey. As many of you have seen closed-economy macroeconomics and finance, let me end with

some quotes from More Is Different: Broken symmetry and the nature of the hierarchical structure of science [Anderson, 1972]. Despite addressing a totally different research field in science, this article may provide us with some useful insights for our uneven path to transition from one-country, closed-economy economics to international, open-economy economics.

The reductionist hypothesis may still be a topic for controversy among philosophers, but among the great majority of active scientists I think it is accepted without question. The workings of our minds and bodies, and of all the animate or inanimate matter of which we have any detailed knowledge, are assumed to be controlled by the same set of fundamental laws, which except under certain extreme conditions we feel we know pretty well...

The main fallacy in this kind of thinking is that the reductionist hypothesis does not by any means imply a "constructionist" one: The ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. In fact, the more the elementary particle physicists tell us about the nature of the fundamental laws, the less relevance they seem to have to the very real problems of the rest of science, much less to those of society. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. The behavior of large and complex aggregates of elementary particles, it turns out, is not to be understood in terms of a simple extrapolation of the properties of a few particles. Instead, at each level of complexity entirely new properties appear, and the understanding of the new behaviors requires research which I think is as fundamental in its nature as any other. That is, it seems to me that one may array the sciences roughly linearly in a hierarchy, according to the idea: The elementary entities of science X obey the laws of science Y.

But this hierarchy does not imply that science X is "just applied Y." At each stage entirely new laws, concepts, and generalizations are necessary, requiring inspiration and creativity to just as great a degree as in the previous one. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry...

The arrogance of the particle physicist and his intensive research may be behind us (the discoverer of the positron said "the rest is chemistry"), but we have yet to recover from that of some molecular biologists, who seem determined to try to reduce everything about the human organism to "only" chemistry, from the common cold and all mental disease to the religious instinct. Surely there are more levels of organization between human ethology and DNA than there are between DNA and quantum electrodynamics, and each level can require a whole new conceptual structure.

In closing, I offer two examples from economics of what I hope to have said. Marx said that quantitative differences become qualitative ones, but a dialogue in Paris in the 1920's sums it up even more clearly:

FITZGERALD: The rich are different from us.

HEMINGWAY: Yes, they have more money.

# Part I

# A Benchmark Economy

# Summary

- We develop a benchmark two-country model of international real business cycles. Restrictions on the exchange rate  $e_t$  are imposed by both goods market conditions:

$$
\frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})} = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}},
$$

and asset market conditions:

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right].
$$

- Trading in the risk-free bond market implies that the currency's expected return is determined by its risk premium:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} \right] = - c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right),
$$

and that the exchange rate level is determined by the expectation of future interest rates and currency risk premia:

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} \right] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r p _ {t + j} \right] + \bar {e}.
$$

- When markets are complete, we can further simplify the exchange rate movement and currency expected return as

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*},
$$

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] = \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}).
$$

We start with a benchmark economy with international trade in goods and bonds, which is the basis for extensions in later chapters. We characterize the dynamics of the exchange rate and the currency return in this model, and, in doing so, showcase some standard tech-

niques.

# 1.A Model Set-up

# 1.A.1 Households

We consider an endowment economy with two countries, home and foreign. Each country has a continuum of identical households. Equivalently, we can think of a representative household in each country. Each country has a unique type of goods, labeled as home goods and foreign goods. The home households receive an endowment of  $y_{t}$  units of the home goods, and the foreign households receive an endowment of  $y_{t}^{*}$  units of the foreign goods.

Home and foreign households derive utility from consuming both countries' goods. Let  $c_{H}$  denote the home households' consumption of the home goods, and  $c_{F}$  denote the home households' consumption of the foreign goods. The home households' aggregate consumption is a Cobb-Douglas aggregation of the home and foreign goods:

$$
c _ {t} = (c _ {H, t}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {F, t}) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

which means that  $c_{H,t}$  units of the home goods and  $c_{F,t}$  units of the foreign goods can be combined to form  $c_t$  units of the home consumption bundle, which is the unit of account for the home households' aggregate consumption. In our analysis, we carefully distinguish between the home consumption bundle and the home goods. Similarly, foreign households also combine the home and foreign goods into the foreign consumption bundle, which we will specify later. Some papers also refer to the home and foreign goods as the intermediate goods, and the home and foreign consumption bundles as the final goods. These terms will carry more meaning when we discuss the production side of the economy such as in Section 3.C.

The expected lifetime utility for home households is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} u (c _ {t}) \right],
$$

where  $u(c_{t})$  is a generic utility function that takes the home households' aggregate consumption  $c_{t}$  as the argument, and  $\delta$  is the subjective discount factor. We usually impose some regularity conditions on the utility function, so that it is twice continuously differentiable, increasing in  $c_{t}$ , and concave.

The log real exchange rate  $e_t$  is defined as the log exchange ratio between the home consumption bundle and the foreign consumption bundle. That is, to afford 1 unit of the home consumption, we need to spend  $\exp(e_t)$  units of the foreign consumption. Our convention

is such that  $e_t$  increases when the home currency appreciates in real terms, which means the home consumption bundle becomes more expensive.

The home and foreign risk-free bonds are denominated in the units of their respective consumption bundles. For now, we focus on the one-period bond only: 1 unit of the bond issued in period  $t$  promises to pay out 1 unit of consumption bundle in the next period  $t + 1$ . The home bond's interest rate is  $r_t$ , implying that the price for 1 unit of the bond is  $\exp(-r_t)$  units of home consumption bundles in period  $t$ . Similarly, the foreign bond's interest rate is  $r_t^*$ , implying that the price for 1 unit of the bond is  $\exp(-r_t^*)$  units of foreign consumption bundles in period  $t$ . The home and foreign households can freely trade both types of bonds.

Using the home consumption bundle as the numérique, we can express the home households' budget constraint as

$$
p _ {t} y _ {t} + b _ {H, t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t - 1}\right) + b _ {F, t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - e _ {t}\right) = c _ {t} + b _ {H, t} + b _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}), \tag {1.1}
$$

where  $y_{t}$  denotes the endowment of the home goods,  $p_{t}$  denotes the price of the home goods in the unit of the home consumption bundle,  $b_{H,t}$  denotes the market value of the home risk-free bond held by the home households, and  $b_{F,t}$  denotes the market value of the foreign risk-free bond held by the home households. In this equation, the left-hand side is the home households' income from the endowment in period  $t$  plus their savings in the bond market from period  $t - 1$ , and the right-hand side is the home households' expenditure for the consumption in period  $t$  and their investments in the bond market for consumption in future periods.

We can introduce other tradable assets such as equities and long-term bonds by extending this budget constraint. A particularly useful case is when the households can trade the complete set of contingent claims. We will consider this complete-market case in Section 1.C.

# 1.A.2 Intertemporal Solution

We write the home households' Lagrangian as

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} u (c _ {t}) + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {t} \left(p _ {t} y _ {t} + b _ {H, t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t - 1}\right) + b _ {F, t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - e _ {t}\right) - c _ {t} - b _ {H, t} - b _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t})\right) \right].
$$

The first-order conditions w.r.t.  $c_{t},b_{H,t}$  , and  $b_{F,t}$  are

$$
\delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) - \zeta_ {t} = 0,
$$

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ - \zeta_ {t} + \zeta_ {t + 1} \exp (r _ {t}) \right] = 0,
$$

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ - \zeta_ {t} \exp (- e _ {t}) + \zeta_ {t + 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - e _ {t + 1}\right) \right] = 0.
$$

These equations imply the following Euler equations:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})} \exp (r _ {t}) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t + 1}\right)}{u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)} \exp \left(- \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

which describe how the households trade off consumption and saving intertemporally. For example, we can express the first Euler equation as

$$
u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t + 1}\right) \exp \left(r _ {t}\right) \right].
$$

The left-hand side represents the increase in utility from consuming a small amount of the home consumption bundle in period  $t$ , which is  $u'(c_t)$  in the limit. The right-hand side represents the expected increase in the utility from saving this additional consumption bundle in home bonds, earning interests and receiving  $\exp(r_t)$  in period  $t + 1$ , and deriving  $u'(c_{t+1})$  utils from each additional unit of consumption in period  $t + 1$ . The households discount these future utils by the subjective discount rate  $\delta$ , and equalize the left- and right-hand sides so that they are indifferent between these two options.

We denote the marginal utility growth as

$$
\exp (m _ {t + 1}) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})},
$$

which is commonly referred to as the stochastic discount factor (SDF) or the pricing kernel in the asset pricing literature. In this note, we will focus on the relationship between the SDF and the exchange rate. That said, if the same households can also trade the claim to the endowment, then, the same SDF also prices the endowment claim. Let  $m_{t,t+k} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \sum_{j=1}^{k} m_{t+j}$  denote the cumulative SDF from period  $t$  to  $t + k$ . Then, the price of the home country's endowment claim is

$$
p _ {t} ^ {m} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t, t + k}) p _ {t + k} y _ {t + k} \right].
$$

Similarly, if the claim to the households' consumption stream is trad- able, we can also price the households' wealth as

$$
p _ {t} ^ {w} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t, t + k}) c _ {t + k} \right].
$$

# 1.A.3 Within-Period Solution

Let  $p_t^*$  denote the price of the foreign goods in the unit of the foreign consumption bundle. Using the home consumption bundle as the

numérique, the price of the home consumption bundle is 1. Then, the law of one price implies

$$
1 \cdot \left(c _ {H, t}\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(c _ {F, t}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} = 1 \cdot c _ {t} = p _ {t} c _ {H, t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}). \tag {1.2}
$$

Substitute this equation into the Lagrangian:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} u \left(\left(c _ {H, t}\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(c _ {F, t}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}\right) \right. \\ \left. + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {t} (p _ {t} y _ {t} + b _ {H, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1}) + b _ {F, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - e _ {t}) - p _ {t} c _ {H, t} - \exp (- e _ {t}) p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} - b _ {H, t} - b _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t})) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

The first-order conditions w.r.t.  $c_{H,t}$ ,  $c_{F,t}$  are

$$
\delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) \alpha (\frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}}) ^ {1 - \alpha} - \zeta_ {t} p _ {t} = 0,
$$

$$
\delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) (1 - \alpha) (\frac {c _ {H , t}}{c _ {F , t}}) ^ {\alpha} - \zeta_ {t} p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) = 0,
$$

which implies that the consumption ratio  $c_{F,t} / c_{H,t}$  between foreign and home goods is a function of the relative prices:

$$
\frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})} = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}}. \tag {1.3}
$$

Moreover, plug this solution into (1.2), we obtain

$$
c _ {t} = p _ {t} c _ {H, t} + \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} p _ {t} c _ {H, t} = \frac {1}{\alpha} p _ {t} c _ {H, t},
$$

$$
c _ {t} = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}) + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}) = \frac {1}{1 - \alpha} p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}),
$$

which implies that the expenditure shares for home and foreign goods are constant under the Cobb-Douglas aggregator and a general utility function:

$$
p _ {t} c _ {H, t} = \alpha c _ {t}, \tag {1.4}
$$

$$
p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}) = (1 - \alpha) c _ {t}. \tag {1.5}
$$

Moreover, plug in  $(c_{H,t})^{\alpha}(c_{F,t})^{1 - \alpha} = c_t$ , we can express the goods' prices (i.e.,  $p_t$  and  $p_t^*\exp (-e_t))$  in the unit of the home consumption bundle as functions of the relative consumption weights:

$$
p _ {t} = \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}, \qquad p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) = (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {H , t}}{c _ {F , t}}\right) ^ {\alpha}.
$$

A commonly used notion is the terms of trade, defined as the ratio between the price index of exported goods and the price index of imported goods from the perspective of a given country. In our setting, the home country exports home goods and imports foreign

goods. As such, the terms of trade are simply the ratio of prices between home and foreign goods:

$$
\exp (t o t _ {t}) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})},
$$

which allows us to express goods' prices in the unit of the home consumption bundle as

$$
p _ {t} = \alpha \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}, \qquad p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) = (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {- \alpha}.
$$

Likewise, we can derive the same problem from the foreign households' perspective, and obtain

$$
p _ {t} ^ {*} = \alpha \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (- t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}, \qquad p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t}) = (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (- t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {- \alpha},
$$

which implies that the real exchange rate and the terms of trade are tightly connected:

$$
e _ {t} = (2 \alpha - 1) t o t _ {t}.
$$

So, we can simplify Eq. (1.3) to

$$
\exp \left(\frac {e _ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1}\right) = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}}.
$$

That is, within a period, the households choose between consuming home and foreign goods by comparing the relative prices as captured by the real exchange rate  $e_t$  and the relative consumption weights  $\alpha$  and  $1 - \alpha$ .

# 1.A.4 Foreign Country

For foreign households, symmetrically, we define the foreign consumption bundle as

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} = (c _ {F} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {H} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \alpha}.
$$

Given  $\alpha > 1/2$ , the foreign consumption bundle leans towards the foreign goods, whereas the home consumption bundle leans towards the home goods.

The foreign households' budget constraint is

$$
p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} + b _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} \exp (r _ {t - 1} + e _ {t}) + b _ {F, t - 1} ^ {*} \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}) = c _ {t} ^ {*} + b _ {H, t} ^ {*} \exp (e _ {t}) + b _ {F, t} ^ {*}
$$

The Lagrangian is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} u \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {t} ^ {*} \left(p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} + \exp \left(r _ {t - 1} + e _ {t}\right) b _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} + b _ {F, t - 1} ^ {*} \exp \left(r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}\right) - c _ {t} ^ {*} - b _ {H, t} ^ {*} \exp (e _ {t}) - b _ {F, t} ^ {*}\right) \right].
$$

The intertemporal solution implies

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1} ^ {*})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})} \exp (r _ {t} + \Delta e _ {t + 1}) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1} ^ {*})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {*}) \right],
$$

and the within-period solution implies

$$
\frac {p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t})}{p _ {t} ^ {*}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}},
$$

$$
p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t}) = (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {\alpha},
$$

$$
p _ {t} ^ {*} = \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}.
$$

# 1.A.5 Market Clearing

In the goods market, the endowment is equal to the sum of home and foreign consumption:

$$
y _ {t} = c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
y _ {t} ^ {*} = c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*}.
$$

In the bonds market, the bonds are in zero net supply:

$$
0 = b _ {H, t} + b _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
0 = b _ {F, t} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*}.
$$

# 1.A.6 Macro Synthesis

Throughout this book, we study the competitive equilibrium defined in the usual fashion: all households maximize their utilities taking goods prices, asset prices, and exchange rates as given, and the markets for goods and assets are cleared.

The only exogenous variables are the endowments:

$$
(y _ {t}, y _ {t} ^ {*}) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}.
$$

There are 15 endogenous variables in each period  $t$ :

$$
(c _ {t}, c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}, b _ {H, t}, b _ {F, t}, p _ {t}, c _ {t} ^ {*}, c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}, b _ {H, t} ^ {*}, b _ {F, t} ^ {*}, p _ {t} ^ {*}, r _ {t}, r _ {t} ^ {*}, e _ {t}) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty},
$$

plus two auxiliary variables  $\exp(m_{t+1})$  and  $\exp(m_{t+1}^*)$  that denote the home and foreign SDFs:

$$
\exp (m _ {t + 1}) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})},
$$

$$
\exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1} ^ {*})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})}.
$$

The model implies the following 16 equations in each period, one of which is redundant because the market clearing conditions add up to the sum of households' budget constraints. These 16 equations include 2 consumption aggregation equations,

$$
c _ {t} = (c _ {H, t}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {F, t}) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} = (c _ {F, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {H, t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

4 household budget constraints,

$$
p _ {t} y _ {t} + b _ {H, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1}) + b _ {F, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - e _ {t}) = c _ {t} + b _ {H, t} + b _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}),
$$

$$
c _ {t} = p _ {t} c _ {H, t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}),
$$

$$
p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} + b _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} \exp (r _ {t - 1} + e _ {t}) + b _ {F, t - 1} ^ {*} \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}) = c _ {t} ^ {*} + b _ {H, t} ^ {*} \exp (e _ {t}) + b _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} = p _ {t} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} \exp (e _ {t}) + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

2 equations describing the households' within-period consumption choices,

$$
\frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})} = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}},
$$

2 goods market clearing conditions,

$$
y _ {t} = c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
y _ {t} ^ {*} = c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

2 bond market clearing conditions,

$$
0 = b _ {H, t} + b _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
0 = b _ {F, t} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

and 4 Euler equations,

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1}\right) \exp \left(r _ {t}\right) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t + 1}) \exp (- \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}) ],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) \exp (r _ {t} ^ {*}) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \exp \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right].
$$

# 1.B Exchange Rate Accounting

Among the equilibrium conditions we derive in the last section, particularly relevant for asset pricing are the four Euler equations:

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right], \tag {1.6}
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \tag {1.7}
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \tag {1.8}
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right]. \tag {1.9}
$$

For the discussion in this section, we assume the random variables are jointly normally distributed. It is possible to extend this analysis to the non-normal case using co-entropy instead of covariance. Under joint normality, the foreign households' Euler equations can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) + r _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) + \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}) + c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}) + r _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

# 1.B.1 Accounting for the Currency Expected Return

To capture the relative performance of the home and foreign currencies, we define the log excess return of the home currency against the foreign currency as

$$
r x _ {t + 1} = \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

This excess return captures the return of the strategy that takes a long position on the home bond and a short position on the foreign bond, which is exposed to the bilateral exchange rate movement.

Then, the Euler equations imply the following result:

Proposition 1.1. The home currency's expected log excess return is determined by the covariance between the log foreign SDF and log exchange rate movement minus a Jensen's term:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} \right] = - c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right). \tag {1.10}
$$

We interpret the right-hand side of Eq. (1.10) as the currency risk premium in log, since the covariance term describes how the exchange rate comoves with the foreign investors' SDF. If the covariance is positive, the home currency tends to appreciate when the foreign households' marginal utility is high. Then, the home currency is a good hedge from the perspective of the foreign households and should earn a low risk premium.

The right-hand side of Eq. (1.10) also has a variance term  $-\frac{1}{2} var_t(\Delta e_{t+1})$  that we refer to as the Jensen's term. To understand this term, it is useful to consider the risk premium expression for the level of the currency return:

$$
\log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1}) ] = - c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right). \tag {1.11}
$$

Compared with the currency risk premium in log defined in Eq. (1.10), the currency risk premium in level conveniently has no Jensen's term. Empirically, for developed countries' currencies, the exchange rate volatility is roughly  $10\%$  per annum. This magnitude implies a

Jensen's term of  $-\frac{1}{2} var_t(\Delta e_{t+1}) = -0.5\%$ , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the covariance term for many currency pairs we usually consider.

We can also derive the currency risk premium from the home households' perspective:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ - r x _ {t + 1} \right] = - c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, - \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right),
$$

$$
\log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (- r x _ {t + 1}) ] = - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}, - \Delta e _ {t + 1}),
$$

which implies that the foreign currency has to offer a higher risk premium if it tends to depreciate when the home SDF is high.

If we combine the expected return expressions from the home and foreign households' perspectives, we obtain the following expression:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} \right] = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ - r x _ {t + 1} \right]
$$

$$
- \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, - \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) + \frac {1}{2} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right). \tag {1.12}
$$

Recall that all these restrictions are derived from the Euler equations for holding the risk-free bonds. So, allowing the households to freely trade in the risk-free bond markets imposes restrictions not only between the currency expected return and the covariance between the SDF and the exchange rate movement from each country's perspective, but also between the home and the foreign perspectives. Specifically, the home and foreign investors need to agree on the equilibrium currency risk premium after the second-order adjustment by the Jensen's term.

# 1.B.2 Accounting for the Exchange Rate Level

Let us denote the home currency's risk premium (including the Jensen's term) as

$$
r p _ {t} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] = - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}),
$$

which implies

$$
e _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ e _ {t + 1} \right] = r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*} - r p _ {t}. \tag {1.13}
$$

If we regard the next period's expected exchange rate level  $\mathbb{E}_t[e_{t + 1}]$  as a reference point, then, Eq. (1.13) implies that the deviation of the current exchange rate from this reference point is determined by the interest rate differential and the currency risk premium. The home currency is stronger relative to the reference point if the home interest rate is higher than the foreign interest rate and if the home currency's risk premium is low.

We can generalize this intuition under the assumption that the real exchange rate is stationary. In this case, there exists a long-run exchange rate level,

$$
\bar{e}\stackrel {\mathrm{def}}{=}\lim_{j\to \infty}\mathbb{E}_{t}[e_{t + j}].
$$

Using this as a more natural reference point for the exchange rate level, we can decompose today's exchange rate level in the following way [Campbell and Clarida, 1987, Froot and Ramadorai, 2005]:

Proposition 1.2. The exchange rate level is equal to the sum of expected future interest rate differentials, the sum of expected future currency risk premia, and the long-run exchange rate level:

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} \right] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r p _ {t + j} \right] + \bar {e}. \tag {1.14}
$$

This formula shows that, if the home currency is currently stronger than its long-run mean, it is either because the home currency is offering a higher interest rate than the foreign currency, or because it has a lower risk premium. This decomposition of the exchange rate level is similar to the Campbell and Shiller [1988] decomposition of the equity price-dividend ratio into a cash flow component, a discount rate component, and a vanishing transversality component, i.e.,

$$
p d _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {\infty} \kappa^ {j - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta \log d _ {t + j} ] - \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {\infty} \kappa^ {j - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + j} ] + \lim _ {j \to \infty} \kappa^ {j} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ p d _ {t + j} ].
$$

In the exchange rate formula (1.14), the interest rate term  $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \mathbb{E}_t[r_{t+j} - r_{t+j}^*]$  can be interpreted as the cash flow component: if the home bond earns a higher interest rate, then, the investors are indeed expecting higher cash flows from holding it, and should therefore impute a higher valuation to the home currency. Since the exchange rate is the relative price between the home and foreign countries, the interest rate differential  $r_{t+j} - r_{t+j}^*$  enters the formula to capture the relative magnitude of the cash flows. Likewise, the risk premium term  $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \mathbb{E}_t[rp_{t+j}]$  can be interpreted as the discount rate component: if the home currency is risky and therefore earns a higher risk premium, then, the investors should use a higher discount rate for the home currency and impute a lower valuation. Finally, the long-run exchange rate level  $\bar{e}$  can be interpreted as the transversality component. The key difference between the exchange rate formula (1.14) and the equity pricing formula above is that there is no discounting by  $\kappa$  in the exchange rate formula, which follows from the fact that no approximation was made in deriving the exchange rate formula.

Moreover, it is simple to go one step further to decompose the exchange rate innovation:

$$
(\mathbb {E} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1}) [ e _ {t} ] = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} (\mathbb {E} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1}) [ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} ] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} (\mathbb {E} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1}) [ r p _ {t + j} ],
$$

which offers a decomposition formula for the volatility of the unexpected exchange rate movement.

This discussion makes it clear that the exchange rate is a forward-looking variable, which incorporates information about future interest rates and risk premia. As a result, if some macro or financial variables capture variations in interest rates or risk premia, the exchange rate should be able to predict these variables [Engel and West, 2005].

# 1.C Complete-Market Solution

When the markets are complete, households in both countries can trade any Arrow-Debreu securities (a.k.a. contingent claims). Then, the households' budget constraints, such as Eq. (1.1), should be revised to reflect these investment opportunities.

There is a more convenient approach to solving this case. By the First Welfare Theorem, the equilibrium outcome is observationally equivalent to the equilibrium outcome under a social planner, who maximizes a weighted sum of the households' welfare [Negishi, 1960]:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (\pi u (c _ {t}) + (1 - \pi) u (c _ {t} ^ {*})) \right],
$$

where the weight  $\pi$  is known as the Pareto weight and is endogenously determined by the households' initial wealth. $^{1}$

The social planner tells the home and foreign households how much to consume, subject to the resource constraints

$$
y _ {t} = c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
y _ {t} ^ {*} = c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*}.
$$

1 The allocation problem in the competitive economy can be formulated as a fictitious social planner's optimization problem even when the markets are incomplete [Cuoco and He, 1994]. In this case, the Pareto weight  $\pi$  is stochastic and related to different agents' marginal utilities. We will consider one such setting in Chapter 5.

The social planner's Lagrangian is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (\pi u (c _ {t}) + (1 - \pi) u (c _ {t} ^ {*})) + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {H, t} (y _ {t} - c _ {H, t} - c _ {H, t} ^ {*}) + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {F, t} (y _ {t} ^ {*} - c _ {F, t} - c _ {F, t} ^ {*}) \right],
$$

which implies the following first-order conditions

$$
\text {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t}: \delta^ {t} \pi u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} = \zeta_ {H, t},
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t} ^ {*}: \delta^ {t} (1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {\alpha} \\ = \zeta_ {H, t}, \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t}: \quad \delta^ {t} \pi u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {H , t}}{c _ {F , t}}\right) ^ {\alpha} \\ = \zeta_ {F, t}, \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t} ^ {*}: \delta^ {t} (1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} \\ = \zeta_ {F, t}. \end{array}
$$

Plug in the within-period solution in Section 1.A, and we obtain the following equilibrium condition:

$$
\pi u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) = (1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \exp \left(e _ {t}\right), \tag {1.15}
$$

which describes the social planner's optimal risk-sharing rule: it sets the allocation so that the home households' marginal utility, weighed by its Pareto weight  $\pi$ , is equal to the foreign households' marginal utility, weighed by its Pareto weight  $(1 - \pi)$  and adjusted by the real exchange rate  $\exp(e_t)$ . The real exchange rate converts the marginal utility from the foreign consumption unit to the home consumption unit.

This equilibrium condition implies a linear allocation rule.

Proposition 1.3. Equilibrium consumption is a linear function of endowments. Specifically, for some value  $k_{t}$ , the consumption of home and foreign goods is

$$
c _ {H, t} = \frac {\alpha k _ {t}}{(1 - \alpha) + \alpha k _ {t}} y _ {t}, \quad c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{(1 - \alpha) + \alpha k _ {t}} y _ {t},
$$

$$
c _ {F, t} = \frac {(1 - \alpha) k _ {t}}{\alpha + (1 - \alpha) k _ {t}} y _ {t} ^ {*}, \qquad \qquad c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\alpha}{\alpha + (1 - \alpha) k _ {t}} y _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

and the aggregate consumption is

$$
c _ {t} = \frac {\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{((1 - \alpha) + \alpha k _ {t}) ^ {\alpha} (\alpha + (1 - \alpha) k _ {t}) ^ {1 - \alpha}} k _ {t} y _ {t} ^ {\alpha} (y _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{((1 - \alpha) + \alpha k _ {t}) ^ {1 - \alpha} (\alpha + (1 - \alpha) k _ {t}) ^ {\alpha}} y _ {t} ^ {1 - \alpha} (y _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha},
$$

where  $k_{t}$  can be solved via the following implicit equation:

$$
\frac {\pi}{1 - \pi} \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})} \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \left(\frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} \left(\frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {\alpha} = 1.
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.1. This optimal risk-sharing rule implies that the equilibrium allocation of home and foreign

goods to home and foreign households is driven by two considerations. First, when the home bias in consumption  $\alpha$  is greater, more home goods are allocated to home households and more foreign goods are allocated to foreign households. Second, an endogenous, stochastic variable  $k_{t}$  further adjusts the shares of the aggregate endowment of home and foreign goods that are allocated to the home households as opposed to the foreign households. When  $k_{t}$  is higher, the home households consume more home and foreign goods relative to the foreign households:

$$
\frac {c _ {H , t}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}} = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} k _ {t}, \qquad \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} k _ {t}.
$$

Once we solve  $k_{t}$ , we can solve the equilibrium allocations without solving for the goods' and the assets' prices in the competitive equilibrium.

We illustrate the equilibrium allocation in a simple numerical example. Suppose the home and foreign households have identical CRRA preferences:  $u(c) = c^{1 - \gamma} / (1 - \gamma)$ , with  $\gamma = 2, \alpha = 0.7$ , and  $\pi = 0.5$ . The endowment  $y_{t}$  is stochastic and  $y_{t}^{*}$  is fixed at 2. Figure 1.1 traces out the equilibrium consumption allocations  $c_{t}$  and  $c_{t}^{*}$  for the home and foreign households as we vary  $y_{t}$ . We can see that, as the home endowments become higher, both countries' consumption increases. The fact that the foreign households' consumption responds to the home endowment shocks reflects international risk-sharing. Moreover, the home country's consumption increases more than the foreign country's consumption: the hypothetical social planner assigns a greater share of the increase in the quantity of home goods to the home households because they derive more utility from consuming home goods due to home bias.

The international risk-sharing can be further illustrated by the international transfer in equilibrium. Figure 1.2 plots the net international transfers of home and foreign households as fractions of their respective endowments. When the home households receive a low endowment  $y_{t}$ , the social planner transfers resources from the foreign country to the home country to balance their marginal utilities. As a result, the home households receive a net transfer paid out by the foreign households.

# 1.C.1 Implied Exchange Rate Dynamics

Using the households' optimality conditions that we derived under the competitive equilibrium, we can back out the prices from quantities. In particular, the optimal risk-sharing rule Eq. (1.15) implies a

relationship between the real exchange rate and marginal utilities:

$$
e _ {t} = \log u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) - \log u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) + \log \frac {\pi}{1 - \pi},
$$

which can be written as

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}. \tag {1.16}
$$

This condition indicates that the bilateral exchange rate movement is solely determined by the difference between the two countries' marginal utility growth when the markets are complete. Specifically, when the home households have a higher marginal utility growth  $m_{t+1}$ , which usually indicates a recession in the home country, the

home currency becomes stronger in real terms. Intuitively, this is when the home households become less willing to hold the foreign currency.

Moreover, the expected excess return on the home currency can be expressed as

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} \right] = - c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}\right), \tag {1.17}
$$

which implies that the home currency's risk premium is decreasing in home SDF volatility and increasing in foreign SDF volatility. As a result, to generate reasonable variations in either conditional or unconditional currency expected returns, the variances of the SDFs play a central role.

Figure 1.3 plots the equilibrium real exchange rate  $e_t$ , which measures the strength of the home currency, as we vary the home endowment  $y_t$ . In states with a low home endowment, the home goods are relatively scarce, leading to stronger terms of trade and a real appreciation of the home currency. This expenditure switching effect arises in a large class of international models, which describes how supply shocks affect the exchange rate determination. As we will see in later sections, this supply effect may be offset by demand shocks.

Another way to understand this relationship is via international risk-sharing: because of the home bias in consumption, the home households' consumption loads more on the home endowment. When the home endowment is low, the home households' marginal utility is higher than the foreign households', and, through the optimal international risk-sharing terms described by Eq. (1.16), requires a real appreciation of home currency to equilibrate their demand for financial assets.

# 1.C.2 Special Case: Log Utility

We consider a special case in which home and foreign households have the log utility, i.e.  $u(c) = \log (c)$ . In this case, the parameter  $k$  is a constant,

$$
k _ {t} = k = \frac {\pi}{1 - \pi},
$$

and Proposition 1.3 implies a simple rule for consumption allocations:

$$
c _ {H, t} = \frac {\alpha \pi}{\alpha \pi + (1 - \alpha) (1 - \pi)} y _ {t}, \quad c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {(1 - \alpha) (1 - \pi)}{\alpha \pi + (1 - \alpha) (1 - \pi)} y _ {t},
$$

$$
c _ {F, t} = \frac {(1 - \alpha) \pi}{(1 - \alpha) \pi + \alpha (1 - \pi)} y _ {t} ^ {*}, \qquad c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\alpha (1 - \pi)}{(1 - \alpha) \pi + \alpha (1 - \pi)} y _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/4caa6424-992f-437c-ac5a-4f95ef04f006/966a235ed2c2ccdd6011a9b8ce7a64282ec95f2c66648adbb358e4834579f1b3.jpg)  
Figure 1.3: Equilibrium Exchange Rate.

This allocation rule has an intuitive interpretation: home and foreign households agree to split the endowments according to their Pareto weights  $\pi$  and  $1 - \pi$  and their home bias  $\alpha$ . If the home households have a higher Pareto weight (i.e.,  $\pi > 0.5$ ), then, the home households always receive more allocations. Moreover, regardless of the Pareto weights, home households always receive more home goods, and foreign households always receive more foreign goods due to their home bias in consumption (i.e.,  $\alpha > 0.5$ ). As such, while this allocation rule allows the households in both countries to share their risks internationally,[2] they may still have different exposures to the home and foreign endowment shocks due to their home bias in consumption.

Since the markets are complete, this allocation can be implemented by a number of financial contracts. For example, the home households hold  $\frac{\alpha\pi}{\alpha\pi + (1 - \alpha)(1 - \pi)}$  unit of the home endowment claim and  $\frac{(1 - \alpha)\pi}{(1 - \alpha)\pi + \alpha(1 - \pi)}$  unit of the foreign endowment claim, and the foreign households hold the remaining fractions. In the symmetric case of  $\pi = 1/2$  and  $\alpha > 1/2$ , the home households hold more than half of the home endowment claim, and less than half of the foreign endowment claim. Therefore, home bias in consumption preference begets home bias in international portfolios. We will discuss the implementation of the complete-market allocation and the corresponding portfolio shares in an example with richer preferences in Section 7.A.

Given these equilibrium consumption allocations, the home and

2 While this statement is true in general, in this case of log preference, the terms-of-trade responses alone provide perfect insurance against output shocks. As a result, the allocation under financial autarky is not far worse off. See [Cole and Obstfeld, 1991] for a detailed discussion.

foreign SDFs can be expressed as

$$
m _ {t + 1} = \log \delta - \Delta \log c _ {t + 1} = \log \delta - \alpha \Delta \log y _ {t + 1} - (1 - \alpha) \Delta \log y _ {t + 1} ^ {*},
$$

$$
m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} = \log \delta - \Delta \log c _ {t + 1} ^ {*} = \log \delta - (1 - \alpha) \Delta \log y _ {t + 1} - \alpha \Delta \log y _ {t + 1} ^ {*},
$$

and the exchange rate movement is driven by the fundamental shocks to the endowments:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} = (2 \alpha - 1) (\Delta \log y _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \Delta \log y _ {t + 1}).
$$

This exchange rate expression again highlights the result in Figure 1.3. Under the social planner's optimal allocation scheme, the home households' allocation is exposed to both home and foreign endowment shocks, with a higher exposure to the home endowment shock. As a result, a negative home endowment shock raises the home households' marginal utility relative to the foreign households', and leads to a real appreciation of the home currency.

# 1.D Asset Market and Goods Market Views of Exchange Rates

In this section, we re-examine the two sets of equilibrium conditions that characterize the exchange rate.

# 1.D.1 The Asset Market View

First, the Euler equations from the intertemporal solutions, reproduced below,

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

impose restrictions on the exchange rate dynamics. By relating the exchange rate movement to the SDFs and interest rates, they represent the asset market view of exchange rates. As we discussed in Section 1.B, these restrictions also characterize the exchange rate level and the currency expected return.

In the complete-market case we discussed in Section 1.C, these restrictions can be further simplified. The exchange rate movement is equal to the SDF differential:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} = \Delta \log u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t + 1}\right) - \Delta \log u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right),
$$

which links the exchange rate movement directly to marginal utility growth. In this case, the real exchange rate movement describes how

the households trade off marginal utilities across time. Specifically, the hypothetical social planner equates the home and foreign households' marginal utility growth rates after converting their numériaires to the same consumption bundle.

Under this view, to make sense of the exchange rate dynamics, our task is to understand the underlying economic structures, preferences, and frictions that give rise to the SDF movements as well as possible deviations from the perfect risk-sharing condition.

# 1.D.2 The Goods Market View

Next, we consider the within-period consumption choices, reproduced below,

$$
\exp (e _ {t}) = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F , t}}{p _ {t} c _ {H , t}},
$$

$$
\exp (- e _ {t}) = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {p _ {t} c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}.
$$

More generally, if we use  $u(c_{H,t}, c_{F,t})$  and  $u^{*}(c_{F,t}^{*}, c_{H,t}^{*})$  to denote the home and foreign households' utilities as functions of their goods-specific consumption, we can express the within-period solutions as

$$
\exp (e _ {t}) = \left(\frac {\partial u (c _ {H , t} , c _ {F , t}) / \partial c _ {H , t}}{\partial u (c _ {H , t} , c _ {F , t}) / \partial c _ {F , t}}\right) ^ {2 \alpha - 1},
$$

$$
\exp (- e _ {t}) = \left(\frac {\partial u ^ {*} (c _ {F , t} ^ {*} , c _ {H , t}) / \partial c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{\partial u ^ {*} (c _ {F , t} ^ {*} , c _ {H , t}) / \partial c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {2 \alpha - 1}.
$$

This set of equations relates the exchange rate level to how the households trade off consumption expenditures between different goods within the same period, which gives rise to the goods market view of exchange rates. Absent frictions in international trade and consumption, a stronger home currency in real terms must correspond to a lower consumption share in the home goods. Conversely, if households experience shocks to how they value home vs. foreign goods, this preference shock also impacts the equilibrium exchange rate.

Moreover, if the economy is stationary and we log-linearize around a symmetric steady state with  $\bar{y} = \bar{y}^*$ ,  $\bar{c} = \bar{c}^*$ , and  $\bar{e} = 0$ , we can combine the within-period solutions with the market clearing conditions in the goods market to obtain the following result:

Proposition 1.4. After a first-order approximation, the relative consumption level between home and foreign households is determined by the equilibrium real exchange rate and the relative endowment level:

$$
(2 \alpha - 1) \left(\log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) = \left(\log y _ {t} - \log y _ {t} ^ {*}\right) + 2 (1 - \alpha) \frac {2 \alpha}{2 \alpha - 1} e _ {t}. \tag {1.18}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.2. This proposition shows that, holding the endowments fixed, a strong home currency in real terms (i.e., higher  $e_{t}$ ) leads to a higher home consumption relative to foreign consumption, because the home endowment offers the home households stronger purchasing power.

# 1.D.3 Harmonizing the Two Views

These two views play fundamental roles in understanding the exchange rate dynamics. A fully specified model needs to take a stance on both aspects. For example, the model we develop in Section 1.A assumes frictionless trading in both financial assets and goods. A more sophisticated model can enrich the asset markets, by introducing richer preferences and shocks to the SDFs as we will discuss in Chapter 3, by introducing deviations from the Euler equations (1.6) to (1.9) as we will discuss in Chapters 4 and 10, or by introducing incomplete asset market spanning as we will discuss in Chapter 5.

The effects of these additional ingredients in the asset markets can be understood in reduced form as wedges. For example, suppose the households have power utilities with a relative risk aversion of  $\gamma$ . Then, the real exchange rate can be written as its complete-market solution plus an asset market wedge  $\tau_t^{AM}$ :

$$
e _ {t} = - \gamma \left(\log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) + \tau_ {t} ^ {A M}.
$$

This wedge captures the deviations from this benchmark characterization of the households' intertemporal substitution.

Similarly, a more sophisticated model can enrich the goods market by introducing frictions in the international trade of the goods, such as invoicing frictions and producer mark-ups, by introducing costs in the international transportation of the goods, or by introducing shocks to household preferences over different types of goods.

The real exchange rate can be written as the frictionless goods market solution (1.18) plus a goods market wedge  $\tau_t^{GM}$ :

$$
(2 \alpha - 1) (\log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*}) = (\log y _ {t} - \log y _ {t} ^ {*}) + 2 (1 - \alpha) \frac {2 \alpha}{2 \alpha - 1} e _ {t} + \tau_ {t} ^ {G M}.
$$

This wedge captures the deviations from the within-period consumption allocation in frictionless goods market.

Combining these two equations, we obtain the following approximate expression for the real exchange rate:

$$
\left(\frac {2 \alpha - 1}{\gamma} + 2 (1 - \alpha) \frac {2 \alpha}{2 \alpha - 1}\right) e _ {t} = - \left(\log y _ {t} - \log y _ {t} ^ {*} - \frac {2 \alpha - 1}{\gamma} \tau_ {t} ^ {A M} + \tau_ {t} ^ {G M}\right), \tag {1.19}
$$

which shows that the exchange rate is driven by the benchmark solution in complete financial markets and frictionless goods market,

which depends on the relative endowments  $(\log y_{t} - \log y_{t}^{*})$ , plus the asset market wedge  $\tau_{t}^{AM}$  and the goods market wedge  $\tau_{t}^{GM}$ .

Any model we consider in this note can be characterized by its stance on the supply of consumption goods and the two wedges. While the goods market issues are equally important for understanding the international macro and financial outcomes, we focus more on the asset market view in this note.

# Puzzles: Challenges to Making Sense of Data

# Summary

- The stochastic properties of the exchange rate movement—cyclicality, volatility, expected return, and comovement—exhibit puzzling patterns that are difficult to explain by the complete-market benchmark model.  
- Combining bond and currency forward positions generates non-zero risk-free returns. These near-arbitrage spreads also require significant modifications on the benchmark model.  
- International portfolio quantities and capital flows exhibit strong asymmetry and cyclicality, which also impose important restrictions on how we specify the model.

# 2.A Challenges to Making Sense of Exchange Rates

The two-country economy we derived in the previous chapter is a direct extension of the standard one-country real business cycle model. When pioneers in this field confront the model's implications with the exchange rate data, many puzzles emerge. Each puzzle sheds light on a dimension of the exchange rate data that is at odds with the benchmark model, and serves as a useful landmark to guide us to think about how to make progress in the theoretical literature.

In this section, we build on the complete-market solution derived from the previous chapter. In particular, we are going to focus on Eq. (1.16), reproduced below, which relates the equilibrium exchange rate movement to the SDFs:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}.
$$

As this lecture note focuses on the theoretical foundation, we only provide a brief overview of the empirical puzzles. For more comprehensive reviews of the empirical literature, see the lecture notes by Ralph Koijen and Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh<sup>1</sup> and the lecture notes from Stanford Big-Data Initiative in International Macro-Finance.<sup>2</sup>

# 2.A.1 Volatility Puzzle

If we take an unconditional variance on both the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. (1.16), we obtain

$$
v a r (\Delta e _ {t + 1}) = v a r (m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) = v a r (m _ {t + 1}) + v a r (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) - 2 c o v (m _ {t + 1}, m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}),
$$

which states that the exchange rate variance should be equal to the variance of the SDF differential, which can be decomposed to the sum of SDF variances minus two times the SDF covariance.

By the Hansen and Jagannathan [1991] bound, we can derive a lower bound on the SDF volatility based on the Sharpe ratio of any risky asset with return  $\tilde{r}$ :

$$
\operatorname {s t d} \left(m _ {t + 1}\right) \geq \exp \left(- r ^ {f}\right) \left| \frac {\mathbb {E} \left[ \tilde {r} - r ^ {f} \right]}{\operatorname {s t d} (\tilde {r})} \right|.
$$

For example, if the stock market has a Sharpe ratio of 0.6 per annum, then, the SDF's volatility must be at least roughly  $60\%$  per annum. There may be other trading strategies that produce higher Sharpe ratios, implying an even higher SDF volatility.

Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara [2006] compares the implied SDF volatility with the exchange rate movement's volatility. Between developed economies, the exchange rate movement's volatility is roughly  $10\%$  per annum, which is much lower than the SDF volatility. Then, if markets are complete, either the exchange rate movement's volatility is anomalously low, or the correlation between home and foreign SDFs is incredibly high, which implies a high degree of international risk-sharing.

This puzzle triggers two responses in the subsequent literature. First, many papers stay within the complete-market benchmark but posit mechanisms that generate a high correlation between home and foreign SDFs. Chapter 3 develops this idea in detail. Second, other papers deviate from the complete-market benchmark and study alternative settings in which Eq. (1.16) do not hold. Chapters 4 and 5 develop some of these ideas in detail.

# 2.A.2 Exchange Rate Disconnect

Use the definition of the SDFs in Section 1.A, we can rewrite Eq. (1.16) as

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = \Delta \log u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1}) - \Delta \log u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}),
$$

which implies that the exchange rate movement should be closely related to the consumption growth or other business cycle variables. For example, if we assume a power utility, i.e.,  $u(c) = c^{1 - \gamma} / (1 - \gamma)$ ,

then, the exchange rate movement should be perfectly correlated with the consumption growth differential between home and foreign countries. In other words, the exchange rate has to be strongly countercyclical with respect to the local consumption growth.

This implication is at odds with the data. Meese and Rogoff [1983], Backus and Smith [1993] are among the earlier papers that observe a lack of correlation between exchange rate movements and economic fundamentals such as the consumption growth<sup>3</sup>. Backus and Smith [1993] directly compare the exchange rate movement and the consumption growth differential between OECD countries, which gives rise to the Backus-Smith regression that is commonly used by subsequent papers:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = \alpha + \beta \Delta (c _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - c _ {t + 1}) + \varepsilon_ {t + 1}.
$$

While the complete-market benchmark model with power utility predicts a positive regression coefficient  $\beta$ , empirical estimates of  $\beta$  are usually around zero or even negative, which implies that the exchange rate movement is acyclical or even mildly procyclical with respect to the local consumption growth.

In addition to consumption and fundamental variables, the exchange rate movements are not easily spanned by bond returns, either [Chernov and Creal, 2023].

Attempts to theoretically resolve this disconnect between exchange rates and economic fundamentals again fall under the two categories above. First, within the complete-market benchmark, we can posit mechanisms that generate volatile exchange rates while keeping their correlation with economic fundamentals low. This can be done by considering richer preferences or additional (and usually unobservable) drivers of the SDFs, or both. Second, we consider deviations from the complete-market benchmark, which generate wedges in the Euler equations that disentangle the exchange rates from the economic fundamentals that ought to drive the SDFs.

# 2.A.3 Currency Risk Premium in the Cross-section

Besides exchange rate volatility and correlation with economic fundamentals, currency returns also have several salient patterns. Consider first the unconditional expected returns in the cross-section of currencies. According to the derivation in Section 1.B,

$$
\mathbb {E} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] = \mathbb {E} [ r p _ {t} ] \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} \left[ - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}) \right].
$$

Among developed countries, some currencies like Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar have persistently high excess returns

3 Also see Kollmann [1995], Engel and West [2005].

against the U.S. dollar, whereas some currencies like Japanese Yen and Swiss Francs have persistently low excess returns against the U.S. dollar.

Moreover, currencies' average returns are also correlated with their interest rates. Low-return currencies like Japanese Yen and Swiss Francs tend to have low interest rates, while high-return currencies like Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar tend to have high interest rates. Let  $rx_{t+1}^{i}$  denote the log excess return of currency  $i$  against the dollar. Then, if we regress the realized currency return on ex-ante interest rates in the cross-section of currencies:

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = \alpha_ {t} ^ {i} + \beta_ {t} (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$}) + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

the slope coefficient  $\beta_{t}$  tends to be positive. As a result, if we sort currencies into portfolios based on their interest rates and buy high interest rate currencies against low interest rate currencies, which may produce more stable differences in currency risk premia [Lustig and Verdelhan, 2007], we obtain a carry trade portfolio that offers high average returns.

# 2.A.4 Currency Risk Premium in the Time Series

The positive association between interest rates and currency returns applies to not only the cross-section of currencies but also the time series of a specific currency pair. Fama [1984] first shows this result using the forward premium, which is the difference between the currency forward rate and the spot exchange rate. A forward contract allows investors to lock in the foreign exchange rate at a fixed rate  $f_{t}^{i}$  in the next period. Fama [1984] regresses the currency excess return on the ex-ante forward premium in the times series of currency  $i$  against the U.S. dollar:

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = \alpha^ {i} + \beta (f _ {t} ^ {i} - e _ {t} ^ {i}) + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

and obtain a positive regression coefficient  $\beta$ . This result is known as the Forward Premium Puzzle, because in models with risk-neutral households, the expected currency excess return should be zero and uncorrelated with the forward premium.

When there is no arbitrage, the covered interest rate parity (CIP) holds (see Section 2.A.6 for more details):

$$
f _ {t} ^ {i} - e _ {t} ^ {i} = r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S}. \tag {2.1}
$$

As a result, we obtain very similar results if we regress the currency excess return on interest rate differential instead of the forward premium:

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = \alpha^ {i} + \beta (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$}) + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

and the slope coefficient  $\beta$  tends to be positive. This result is often framed as the violation of the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP), which holds when the interest rate differential does not predict the currency return:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} ] = 0 \cdot (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$}).
$$

Equivalently, since the expected excess return is equal to the exchange rate movement plus the interest rate differential, the UIP also implies that the interest rate differential will be exactly offset by the exchange rate movement:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \bigl [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i} \bigr ] = - 1 \cdot \bigl (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$} \bigr).
$$

As such, it is equivalent to test whether the interest rate differential predicts future exchange rate movement or whether it predicts future currency excess return.

A model that seeks to tackle the risk premium puzzles should be able to explain (1) why there are unconditional differences between currencies such as the Japanese Yen vs. the Australian dollar, and (2) why the interest rates vary over time and are correlated with non-trivial variations in the conditional currency expected returns, in particular in the U.S. dollar. To explore the relation between the currency return predictability in the cross-section and the currency return predictability in the time series, Hassan and Mano [2019] conduct a decomposition of currency risk premia into a cross-currency component, a cross-time component, and a residual component. They show that the cross-sectional and time-series patterns may be driven by different forces:

The simplest model that the data do not reject features a cross-sectional asymmetry that makes some currencies pay permanently higher expected returns than others, and larger time series variation in expected returns on the U.S. dollar than on other currencies.

# 2.A.5 Exchange Rate Comovements

While the exchange rate movements are disconnected from the economic fundamentals, they are highly correlated across countries and exhibit a factor structure. According to Verdelhan [2018], two common factors, carry and dollar, account for  $18\%$  to  $80\%$  of the monthly exchange rate movements.

Moreover, these common factors also price the cross-section of currency risk premia [Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan, 2011]. More precisely, let  $f_{t}$  denote a common factor (which can be easily extended to a vector of factors). We regress the currency excess return

or the exchange rate movement on the common factor:

$$
r x _ {t} ^ {i} = \alpha^ {i} + \beta^ {i} f _ {t} + \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {i}.
$$

The slope coefficient  $\beta^i$  measures the currency's exposure to the factor. To the extent that the factor proxies for systematic risks, investors require a higher compensation if the currency has a higher risk exposure. Then, we expect to find a positive association between the currency's expected excess return and its factor loading:

$$
\mathbb {E} [ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} ] \propto \beta^ {i}.
$$

This alignment of risk exposures and risk premia, central to all asset pricing, is also confirmed in the currency market.

# 2.A.6 Covered Interest Rate Parity Violation and Convenience Yields

The exchange rate puzzles above are all related to the stochastic properties of exchange rates. A more recent literature examines returns from currency market strategies that have no risks, at least in theory. The fact that these risk-free strategies earn non-zero returns suggests violations of the no-arbitrage condition, and could therefore shed light on the frictions and preferences faced by the investors in the international financial markets.

The covered interest rate parity (CIP) describes the relation between the forward premium and the interest rate differential, which is given by Eq. (2.1), reproduced below,

$$
f _ {t} ^ {i} - e _ {t} ^ {i} = r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S}.
$$

This parity holds in frictionless markets because the investors can get access to the home risk-free rate by either investing in the home bond with a return of  $r_t^{\mathbb{S}}$ , or investing in the foreign bond and hedging the exchange rate risk using the forward contract, which has a net return of  $r_t^i - f_t^i + e_t^i$ . In the absence of arbitrage, these two risk-free rates in home currency units must be equal.

Traditionally, this is regarded as an identity since its deviation, known as the CIP deviation, will be quickly exploited by the arbitrageurs who actively trade in both the currency forward market and the interest rate market. Indeed, if we use the home and foreign Libor rates as proxies for the home and foreign interest rates  $r_t$  and  $r_t^*$ , this condition holds quite tightly before the Global Financial Crisis. However, Du, Tepper, and Verdelhan [2018b] shows that, after the crisis, this condition breaks down and there is non-trivial variations in both the time series and the cross-section of the Libor CIP deviation.

We use the Libor CIP basis to measure the severity of the Libor CIP deviation, defined as

$$
x _ {t} ^ {L i b o r} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} l i b o r _ {t} ^ {\S} - l i b o r _ {t} ^ {i} + (f _ {t} ^ {i} - e _ {t} ^ {i}).
$$

Figure 2.1 plots the Libor CIP basis between the U.S. and the average developed countries, which is very close to o before the Global Financial Crisis, but has been persistently negative since then. A negative Libor CIP basis means that the dollar Libor rate is below the foreign Libor rate after adjusting for the exchange rate risk, which makes the dollar cheaper to borrow.

Similarly, the Treasury CIP basis is defined by using the Treasury yields as proxies for the interest rates  $r_t$  and  $r_t^*$ :

$$
x _ {t} ^ {T r e a s} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} r _ {t} ^ {\mathbb {S}} - r _ {t} ^ {i} + (f _ {t} ^ {i} - e _ {t} ^ {i}).
$$

Figure 2.1 also plots the Treasury CIP basis. Unlike the Libor CIP basis, the Treasury CIP basis has been negative both before and after the Global Financial Crisis [Du, Im, and Schreger, 2018a, Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig, 2018]. In other words, the U.S. government has been able to borrow at a lower interest rate than the foreign governments, after adjusting for the exchange rate risk. The Treasury CIP deviation will play a central role when we discuss bond convenience yields in Chapter 4.

# 2.A.7 Currency Risk Premia across Horizons

We can also consider the currency returns across multiple horizons, which can be achieved by either rolling over short-term debt positions in home and foreign currencies, or by investing in long-term

debt positions. Lustig, Stathopoulos, and Verdelhan [2019] show that the long-run UIP condition, constructed from long-run exchange rate movements and long-term bond yields, holds in complete markets with stationary exchange rates, because the currency risks are correctly priced in the long-term bond yields.

Engel [2016] shows that high interest rate currencies not only have higher expected returns in the short term, but also are stronger than can be accounted for by the path of expected real interest differentials. In other words, high interest rates must predict lower currency returns in the long term. Relatedly, Dahlquist and Pénasse [2022], Chernov and Creal [2023] show that the exchange rate level predicts currency returns. Thus, a coherent account of the multi-horizon currency returns involves the interest rate predicting higher currency returns and higher exchange rate levels in the short term, and the elevated exchange rate levels predicting lower currency returns in the medium-to-long term.

# 2.B Challenges to Making Sense of Quantities and Flows

# 2.B.1 Global Imbalances

We start with the U.S. net external imbalances vis-à-vis the rest of the world. We consider the equity-like, riskier asset classes and the debt-like, safer asset classes separately. Let us define the net risky position as the sum of portfolio equity assets and foreign direct investment (FDI) assets minus portfolio equity liabilities and FDI liabilities, and define the net safe position as the reserve assets plus debt assets minus debt liabilities [Gourinchas, Rey, and Sauzet, 2019].

Figure 2.2 shows the U.S. net risky and safe positions normalized by GDP, from 1970 to 2021. We make three observations. First, on average, the U.S. net risky position is positive and the U.S. net safe position is negative. In other words, the U.S. holds more foreign risky assets than it issues to the rest of the world, which implies that the U.S. is a net lender of risky assets. On the other hand, the U.S. holds less foreign safe assets than it issues, which implies that the U.S. is a net borrower of safe assets.

Second, these net asset positions have notable cyclical properties. Risky assets tend to depreciate during recessions, whereas safe assets tend to appreciate. As a result, during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the early-2000 stock market crash, the U.S. net risky position contracted while its net safe position expanded.

Third, the U.S. net safe position has been widening steadily since mid-1980s. Currently (end of 2021), it is about  $50\%$  of the U.S. GDP, with a large fraction attributable to the U.S. government debt. In

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/4caa6424-992f-437c-ac5a-4f95ef04f006/54e2de7525ade5a9d50fc768a7751fc3afbf51d4a9f5ac44472a3cb6501b7968.jpg)  
Figure 2.2: U.S. Net External Imbalances. The shaded areas represent NBER recessions. Data source: Lane and Milesi-Ferretti [2007].

comparison, the U.S. net risky position widened before 2008, but it has been contracting since 2010. This contraction is driven by a rising foreign demand for the U.S. equity assets.

We also sum up the U.S. net risky and safe positions to obtain the U.S. net foreign assets (NFA). This is equal to the difference between the foreign assets held by the U.S. investors (i.e., the U.S. external assets) and the U.S. assets held by the foreign investors (i.e., the U.S. external liabilities). Figure 2.3 shows that the U.S. NFA has been widening steadily since the 1980s, and the widening tends to accelerate during recessions. The widening in the past decade is also notable: the U.S. NFA expanded from  $-30\%$  in early 2010s to  $-80\%$  right now, at a speed never seen before.

As we will see in Chapter 7, these imbalances reflect a fundamental asymmetry between the U.S. and the rest of the world. They play an important role in our understanding of the international monetary system, as they are closely tied to the global risk-sharing arrangements and the unique position of the U.S. and the dollar.

# 2.B.2 The Exorbitant Privilege and Duty

Changes in the U.S. external imbalances are driven by both the quantity of capital flows into and out of the U.S. and the returns on the existing assets and liabilities. When we examine the latter component, we find that the U.S. tends to earn a higher return on its external assets relative to what it pays to foreigners on its external liabilities. To describe this phenomenon, the French Minister of Finance Valery Giscard d'Estaing coined the term "exorbitant privilege" in 1965 [Gourinchas and Rey, 2007b, Gourinchas, Rey, and Govillot,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/4caa6424-992f-437c-ac5a-4f95ef04f006/d37a50994c417b08b57ab4963cb7c0f2d5271650fdf995963c905593c514502b.jpg)  
Figure 2.3: U.S. Net Foreign Assets. The shaded areas represent NBER recessions. Data source: Lane and Milesi-Ferretti [2007].

2010, Gourinchas, Rey, and Truempler, 2012]. This exorbitant privilege has been allowing the U.S. to run persistent current account deficits despite being a net debtor to the rest of the world as we saw in Figure 2.3.

The superior return earned by the U.S. can be attributed to two factors. First, as we noted in the discussion of the global imbalances, the U.S. holds more foreign risky assets that have higher average returns, whereas the foreigners hold more U.S. safe assets that have lower average returns. As a result, despite the fact that the U.S. holdings of foreign assets are lower than the foreign holdings of the U.S. assets, the U.S. manages to earn a risk premium on average because of the return differential between the riskier and the safer assets.

Second, when we compare within the class of safe assets, the U.S. is able to borrow at lower interest rates. The U.S. safe assets earn convenience yields, which are often attributed to the U.S. dollar being the dominant reserve currency.

These two factors both contribute to the U.S. earning a net portfolio income from the foreigners. Figure 2.4 plots the annual valuation change and dividend payouts from the U.S. external assets and liabilities, normalized by the U.S. GDP. These series describe the total amount of investment profits that U.S. investors receive abroad and vice versa. Their difference is the net financial gains or losses between the U.S. and the rest of the world.

We make several observations about the U.S. net financial payoff. First, on average, the payoff that U.S. receives from foreign assets exceeds the payoff that U.S. pays to foreigners on its external liabilities. The payoff includes both the dividend or coupon payments and

the capital gains or losses. The U.S. has been earning consistently positive payoffs from the 1960s to the mid 1990s, in early 2000s, and in some years after 2008. Moreover, these magnitudes have been increasing since the 1960s, possibly reflecting increases in international portfolio positions and developments in international financial assets.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/4caa6424-992f-437c-ac5a-4f95ef04f006/273a310c5b8c087b2e6091d2ab7787c73c52b1013bd93858576f06e4fe6a3a6e.jpg)  
Figure 2.4: U.S. Exorbitant Privilege. The figure plots the annual valuation change and dividend payouts from the U.S. external assets and liabilities, normalized by the U.S. GDP. The shaded areas represent NBER recessions. Data source: Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Second, the U.S. net financial payoff is pro-cyclical. It tends to be positive during global expansions and negative during global recessions. For example, the U.S. suffered a net loss equal to  $30\%$  of the U.S. GDP on its external assets in 2008, whereas the foreigners suffered a net loss equal to  $13\%$  of the U.S. GDP on their U.S. assets. This cyclical property is again due to the portfolio asymmetry: the U.S. tends to hold more foreign risky assets, whereas the foreigners tend to hold more U.S. safe assets. The risky assets depreciate more during recessions.

Gourinchas and Rey [2022] refer to this cyclical property as the exorbitant duty. As we will see in Section 7.A, we can interpret the asymmetry in portfolio holdings between the U.S. and the rest of the world as a risk-sharing or insurance arrangement, with the U.S. earning higher returns in good times and paying off the foreigners in bad times.

Third, the nature of the exorbitant privilege and duty seems to have changed in the past decade, in which period the U.S. external assets and liabilities earned similar payoffs. In the past two years after the pandemic, the payoff on the U.S. external liabilities surpassed that on the U.S. external assets. This is driven by a significant outperformance of the U.S. equity assets relative to the foreign equity assets, which raised the capital gains that foreigners earned from the

U.S. equity assets they held. As this difference in return is not driven by the U.S. paying off foreign investors in recessions, this potentially represents a loss of exorbitant privilege as opposed to the exorbitant duty [Jiang, Richmond, and Zhang, 2022c, Atkeson, Heathcote, and Perri, 2022].

There is also a trade side that parallels the fluctuations on the portfolio side. As we will see in Section 9.A, the trade balance  $(TB)$  and the portfolio returns from the income balance  $(IB)$  and capital gains  $(CG)$  jointly determine the evolution of the national accounts captured by the net foreign assets (NFA):

$$
\Delta N F A _ {t} = T B _ {t} + C G _ {t} + I B _ {t}.
$$

An increase in the U.S. net foreign assets can be attributed to either national saving by running a higher trade surplus and saving the income abroad, or earning a higher capital gains or incomes from foreign financial assets. Conversely, holding the NFA constant, a trade deficit can be financed by profits from the portfolio side.

# 2.B.3 Countercyclical Flight To Safety

There is also a quantity aspect to the exorbitant privilege, which can be illustrated by the following hypothetical example that I considered in Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig [2022a]. There are two investment periods. In period 1 the U.S. Treasury yield is high at  $5\%$ . In period 2 the U.S. Treasury yield is low at  $1\%$ . Table 2.1 illustrates the returns and the holdings of home and foreign investors. The foreign investors buy more Treasuries when the yield is lower in period 2, whereas the home investors buy more Treasuries when the yield is higher in period 1. In a crude way, this assumption captures the foreigners' countercyclical flight to safety provided by the U.S. Treasury market: they buy U.S. Treasuries when they are expensive and offer low returns, and they exit their positions when Treasury bonds are cheap and offer high returns.

In this example, the time-weighted average as measured by the geometric mean of the returns over the two years is exactly the same  $2.98\%$  for the U.S. and the foreign investors. In other words, the home and the foreign investors hold the same asset and receive the same return from their Treasury portfolios in each period.

In comparison, the dollar-weighted average as measured by the internal rate of return (IRR) is  $1.37\%$  for the foreign investors and  $4.65\%$  for the home investors—leading to a difference of  $3.28\%$  per annum between home and foreign investors. This IRR measure incorporates how well the investors time the market, and suggests that the foreigners earn a much lower return from their dynamic trading

strategy even when the underlying asset offers the same return.

<table><tr><td colspan="5">Panel A: Description of the Example</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Foreign Investors</td><td colspan="2">Home Investors</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Holdings</td><td>Yield</td><td>Holdings</td><td>Yield</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5%</td><td>10</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>1%</td><td>1</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Time-Weighted Return</td><td>2.98%</td><td></td><td>2.98%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Panel B: IRRs of Cash Flows</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Foreign Investors</td><td colspan="2">Home Investors</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Holdings</td><td>Cash Flows</td><td>Holdings</td><td>Cash Flows</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-1</td><td>10</td><td>-10</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>-8.95</td><td>1</td><td>9.5</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>10.10</td><td>10.10</td><td>1.01</td><td>1.01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Dollar-Weighted Return</td><td>1.37%</td><td></td><td>4.65%</td></tr></table>

Note that this IRR comparison captures a timing dimension of the U.S. funding advantage that is different from the difference in the interest rates as we discussed in the context of CIP deviations. In this example, we can additionally introduce foreign bonds and assume that they are always traded at  $1\%$  higher yields than the U.S. bond, which means their yields are  $6\%$  in year 1 and  $2\%$  in year 2. Then, the U.S. Treasury also enjoys an additional convenience yield regardless of the timing in the bond market. As such, this stylized example illustrates the importance of understanding the U.S. specialness from both the quantity and the pricing sides.

This countercyclical flight to U.S. safe assets benefits their issuers such as the U.S. government. A low dollar-weighted return earned by the foreign investors due to their poor market timing implies a low funding cost faced by the U.S. government due to its great market timing. As a result, in bad times, the U.S. government can borrow not just at a lower interest rate, but the fact that they can borrow a lot is also important. As Gourinchas, Rey, and Sauzet [2019] observe,

In our fiat currency system, being the hegemon confers a specific ability to issue large amounts of nominally safe liabilities (dollar securities), which are happily absorbed by the rest of the world. Thus, the view is that, in case of a deficit, the United States does not have to take restrictive measures, so that the dollar is not an impartial means of international exchange. This is the essence of the exorbitant privilege.

# 2.B.4 Twin Deficits

The U.S. external imbalances are also closely related with the U.S. government budget deficits. Figure 2.5 plots the U.S. government's

Table 2.1: Example of Cash Flows and the IRR Computation

total government debt held by public/GDP ratio and the U.S. external liability/GDP. The first series represents the amount of debt owed by the U.S. government to the U.S. private sector and the rest of the world, whereas the second series represents the amount of debt owed by the U.S. to the rest of the world. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, both the U.S. government and the U.S. as a whole have been borrowing a lot more.

This comovement shows that international finance and government finance are closely intertwined. On the one hand, the foreign investors, private and official, have been financing a large portion of the U.S. external liabilities. To understand why this is the case, it is important to understand why they find the U.S. government debt particularly desirable. On the other hand, a large portion of the U.S. government debt has been financed by foreign investors. To evaluate the U.S. fiscal sustainability, it is also important to take a global perspective. We will consider these issues in detail in Chapters 7 and 8.

# 2.B.5 Other Empirical Patterns

There are many more empirical patterns that this note does not have space to cover. For example, home bias is a salient pattern in international asset allocation.

# Risk Premia and Factor Structure

# Summary

- We first investigate the role of currency risk premium  $rp_{t}$ , which drives both the currency expected return:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] = r p _ {t} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}),
$$

and the exchange rate level:

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} \right] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r p _ {t + j} \right] + \bar {e}.
$$

- The currency risk premium is related to the currency's loadings on the risk factors, which give rise to a factor structure in currency returns:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = \alpha^ {i} + \beta^ {i} f _ {t + 1} + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} \right] = \beta_ {t} ^ {i} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ f _ {t + 1} \right].
$$

We first adopt a no-arbitrage approach to organize the currency risk premium and the corresponding factor structure.

- A natural question is what drives the time-series and cross-sectional variations in the currency risk premium, which is to be answered by general equilibrium models.  
- Finally, we consider the long-term currency risk premia. When markets are complete and the exchange rate is stationary, the long-run UIP condition holds:

$$
e _ {t} - \bar {e} = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} h \left(r _ {t} (h) - r _ {t} ^ {*} (h)\right).
$$

To make sense of the exchange rate puzzles and other salient patterns in international financial markets, we first enrich the risk premium in the baseline model. To be clear, as long as the households' utility function  $u(c)$  is non-linear, the currency risk premium is al-

ready present in the baseline model in Chapter 1. As the exchange rate accounting in Section 1.B shows, the currency risk premium  $rp_{t}$  affects both the currency expected return and the exchange rate level.

In this chapter, we consider specific models that account for the time-series and the cross-sectional variations in the currency risk premium, and understand the properties of the implied exchange rate dynamics. As an initial step, all models presented in this chapter assume complete markets.

Before we start, it is useful to understand what happens in the absence of the risk premium. Then, Eq. (1.13) implies that the exchange rate movement is determined entirely by the current interest rate differential,

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} \right] = r _ {t} ^ {*} - r _ {t},
$$

and, equivalently, the expected currency excess return is zero,

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] = 0.
$$

These conditions are known as the Uncovered Interest Rate Parity. As we discussed in Section 2, these predictions are rejected by the data. Instead, currency expected returns have large variations both in the time series and in the cross-section.

Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe [2007] lay out a related calculation. Eq. (1.13) implies that the interest rate differential is equal to the expected exchange rate movement plus the risk premium term:

$$
r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ - \Delta e _ {t + 1} ] + r p _ {t},
$$

Empirically, there are large variations in the interest rate differential, but the exchange rate appears to be a near random-walk process, which means the exchange rate movement is largely unexpected. As a result, the risk premium term  $r p_{t}$  must have significant variations. This means, to the extent that monetary policies drive a significant fraction of the variations in the interest rates, it must operate not through the first-order moments (i.e., the expected exchange rate movement), but through the second-order moments (i.e., the risk premium).

# 3.A The No-Arbitrage Approach

Our first approach to modeling the currency risk premia starts directly from the SDFs. Because this approach only relies on investors' ability to correctly price the assets based on the covariances between asset returns and their SDFs, it is known as the no-arbitrage approach. This approach asks the following question: what properties

do the SDFs need to have in order to match the observed exchange rate dynamics, such as the time-series and the cross-sectional variations in the currency risk premia, and the relationship between the interest rates and the currency risk premia? Once we understand the answer to this question, we can then turn to general equilibrium models and figure out the economic primitives and frictions that are necessary to generate such SDF properties.

For example, Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan [2011] consider the following specification. The SDF of country  $i$  is

$$
m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = - \mu_ {t} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\delta^ {i} z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \dot {\varepsilon} _ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

where  $\varepsilon_{t + 1}^{w}$  is a global shock and  $\varepsilon_{t + 1}^{i}$  is a country-specific shock. Both shocks are i.i.d. standard normal. When the number of countries  $N$  is large, the country-specific shocks average to zero:

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} = 0.
$$

While we take the SDF dynamics as given, it is important to know that the SDFs ultimately arise from the underlying economy. For example, the SDF shocks  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{w}$  and  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{i}$  could be mapped to the global and country-specific shocks in the production process. They could also arise from shocks to investor preferences. We will discuss some general equilibrium models in which the SDF dynamics are endogenously determined in the following sections.

For expositional convenience, we regard the U.S., denoted by $, as the home country. Let Δe i / $ denote the value of currency i in the unit of the home country. Then, assuming complete markets, we can write down the exchange rate movement directly from the SDF dynamics:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} = m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {\S} \\ = - \left(\mu_ {t} ^ {i} - \mu_ {t} ^ {\$}\right) - \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {\$}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \left(\sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {\$}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {\$}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan [2011] assume that the time-varying volatilities  $z_{t}^{w}$  and  $z_{t}^{i}$  are also driven by the global and the country-specific shocks, and they follow autoregressive square-root processes:

$$
z _ {t} ^ {w} = (1 - \phi) \theta^ {w} + \phi z _ {t - 1} ^ {w} + \sigma \sqrt {z _ {t - 1} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {w}, \tag {3.1}
$$

$$
z _ {t} ^ {i} = (1 - \phi) \theta + \phi z _ {t - 1} ^ {i} + \sigma \sqrt {z _ {t - 1} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {i}. \tag {3.2}
$$

As a result, when either the global shock or the country-specific shock is negative, the SDF becomes not only higher (indicating a higher marginal utility) and drives the exchange rate movement, it also becomes more volatile and affects the currency risk premium.

# 3.A.1 Currency Return Dynamics

Let us characterize the log currency excess return in this set-up, which is defined as

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} + r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S}.
$$

First, the innovation in the currency excess return is given by

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} ] = - \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {\S}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \sqrt {\gamma} \left(\sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {\S}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {\S}\right).
$$

Since the currency excess return is equal to the exchange rate movement plus the interest rate differential, which is known ex-ante, the innovation in the currency excess return is also equal to the innovation in the exchange rate movement:

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} ] = \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} ].
$$

Thus, the conditional variance of the exchange rate movement in log can be expressed as

$$
\operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \mathbb {S}}\right) = \frac {1}{2} \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {\mathbb {S}}}\right) ^ {2} z _ {t} ^ {w} + \frac {1}{2} \gamma \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} + z _ {t} ^ {\mathbb {S}}\right), \tag {3.3}
$$

which shows that the variance  $z_{t}^{w}$  of the global shock and the variances  $z_{t}^{i}$  and  $z_{t}^{s}$  of the country-specific shocks both contribute to the exchange rate variance. Moreover, for two countries whose SDFs have very different loadings on the global shock, their bilateral exchange rate movement loads heavily on the global shock and is therefore more volatile.

Next, we consider the currency risk premium. Plugging the SDF dynamics into Eq. (1.17), we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} r p _ {t} ^ {i / \S} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} \right] = \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {\S}\right) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {i}\right) \tag {3.4} \\ = \frac {1}{2} \left(\delta^ {\mathrm {S}} - \delta^ {i}\right) z _ {t} ^ {w} + \frac {1}{2} \gamma \left(z _ {t} ^ {\mathrm {S}} - z _ {t} ^ {i}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

The first term is easy to interpret: if two countries have different loadings on the global shock, i.e.,  $|\delta^{\mathbb{S}} - \delta^{i}| > 0$ , then, their bilateral exchange rate movement is exposed to the global shock and requires a higher magnitude of risk premium.

The second term is increasing in the difference between the volatilities of the two countries' idiosyncratic shocks, i.e.,  $z_{t}^{s} - z_{t}^{i}$ , which is more subtle. The readers might wonder why idiosyncratic risks appear in the risk premium. For example, from the U.S. households' perspective, should they not care about the foreign country's idiosyncratic risk  $z_{t}^{i}$  since it is uncorrelated with the U.S. SDF?

To answer this question, let us first consider the currency risk premium in level:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S}\right) \right] \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ 1 + \frac {\exp \left(e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} + r _ {t} ^ {i}\right) - \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {\S}\right)}{\exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {\S}\right)} \right],
$$

which captures the expected profit of a trading strategy that takes a long position on the foreign bond and a short position on the U.S. bond. By Eq. (1.11),

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \$}) ] = \exp (- c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {\$}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \$})) \\ = \exp \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {\S}} \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {\S}} - \sqrt {\bar {\delta} ^ {i}}\right) z _ {t} ^ {w} + \gamma z _ {t} ^ {\S}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

which does not contain the  $z_{t}^{i}$  term. The term  $\sqrt{\delta^{\mathbb{S}}} (\sqrt{\delta^{\mathbb{S}}} - \sqrt{\delta^{i}})z_{t}^{w}$  comes from the U.S. SDF's and the exchange rate movement's loadings on the global shock  $\varepsilon_{t + 1}^{w}$ , and the term  $\gamma z_{t}^{\mathbb{S}}$  comes from their loadings on the U.S.-specific shock  $\varepsilon_{t + 1}^{\mathbb{S}}$ . As the global shock and the U.S.-specific shock both affect the U.S. SDF, they are priced risk factors from the U.S. perspective. $^{1}$

Now, let us revisit the currency risk premium in log, which is related to the levels by

$$
r p _ {t} ^ {i / \S} = \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S}) ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S}).
$$

Similarly, if we take the foreign perspective,

$$
r p _ {t} ^ {\$ / i} = \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {\$ / i}) ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \$}).
$$

Combine these two expressions and use the definition that implies the log risk premia are symmetric, i.e.,  $r p_{t}^{i / \mathbb{S}} = -r p_{t}^{\mathbb{S} / i}$ . We have

$$
r p _ {t} ^ {i / \S} = \frac {1}{2} (\log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S}) ] - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {\S / i}) ]).
$$

Therefore, the log risk premium can be thought of as an average between the level risk premia from the U.S. and the foreign perspectives, which care about the U.S.-specific and the foreign-specific risks, respectively.

It is also worth noting that the currency risk premia in level are not symmetric:

$$
\log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \mathbb {S}}) ] \neq - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {\mathbb {S} / i}) ],
$$

which leads to the following result commonly known as the Siegel's paradox. For example, assume  $r_t^{\S} = r_t^i = 0$  and  $\mathbb{E}_t[\Delta e_{t+1}^{i/\S}] = 0$ . Then, the currency risk premium in log is zero:  $rp_t^{i/\S} = -rp_t^{\S/i} = 0$ . However, given that the exchange rate is volatile, Jensen's inequality

That said, the bilateral exchange rates between different foreign currencies and the dollar only have heterogeneous loadings on the global shock, but not on the U.S.-specific shock. Therefore, the U.S.-specific shock leads to identical risk premia across all foreign currencies, which is  $\gamma z_{t}^{s}$ .

implies that the expected currency excess return in level is above 1 from both the U.S. and the foreign perspectives:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S}) ] > \exp (\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} ]) = 1 \text {a n d} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {\S / i}) ] > \exp (\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {\S / i} ]) = 1.
$$

Because of this property, we use the currency risk premium in log for most parts of this paper.

These results connect currency risk premia and realized currency excess returns to the factor structure of the SDFs. We make three more observations. First, for a country whose loading  $\delta^i$  on the global shock is high, its currency tends to appreciate during global recessions (i.e.,  $rx_{t+1}^{i/\$}$  increases when  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^w$  declines), and have a lower currency risk premium  $rp_t^{i/\$}$ . Therefore, currencies with higher loading  $\delta^i$  are considered as safe currencies, and currencies with lower loading  $\delta^i$  are considered as risky currencies.

Second, as for the country-specific shocks, even though they are idiosyncratic from the aggregate perspective and there is full risk-sharing between countries, they still affect currency returns and risk premia. This feature can arise from general equilibrium models if the local households have a consumption bias towards home goods, so that their consumption allocation and marginal utility tilt towards the local shock despite full risk-sharing. Specifically, when  $z_{t}^{i}$  is high, country  $i$ 's SDF is volatile, and its local households require a higher risk premium to hold foreign currencies.

Third, if two countries have high and identical idiosyncratic volatilities, i.e.,  $z_{t}^{i} = z_{t}^{\S} \gg 0$ , then, their bilateral exchange rate movement is volatile, while the currency risk premium can remain low. Conversely, we can generate a high currency risk premium without a volatile exchange rate movement. To do so, notice that the global risk loadings enter the exchange rate variance expression (3.3) as  $\left(\sqrt{\delta^{i}} - \sqrt{\delta^{\S}}\right)^{2}$ , whereas they enter the currency risk premium expression (3.4) as  $\delta^{\S} - \delta^{i} = \left(\sqrt{\delta^{i}} - \sqrt{\delta^{\S}}\right)\left(\sqrt{\delta^{i}} + \sqrt{\delta^{\S}}\right)$ . Then, high loadings on the global shock, i.e.,  $\delta^{\S} \approx \delta^{i} \gg 0$ , can generate a high currency risk premium without a volatile exchange rate movement. For example, if  $\delta^{\S} = 10$  and  $\delta^{i} = 9$ ,  $\left(\sqrt{\delta^{i}} - \sqrt{\delta^{\S}}\right)^{2} = 0.03$  implies a low exchange rate volatility, whereas  $\delta^{\S} - \delta^{i} = 1$  implies a high currency risk premium. As such, this no-arbitrage framework provides a flexible way to match different patterns in exchange rate volatilities and currency risk premia.

# 3.A.2 Interest Rate Dynamics

This no-arbitrage framework also provides a simple characterization of the interest rate dynamics. From the Euler equation (1.6), repro

duced below,

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} + r _ {t} ^ {i}) \right],
$$

and under joint normality, the interest rate in country  $i$  can be expressed as

$$
r _ {t} ^ {i} = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {i}) = \mu_ {t} ^ {i} - \frac {1}{2} \delta^ {i} z _ {t} ^ {w} - \frac {1}{2} \gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}.
$$

In this expression, the quadratic terms  $-\frac{1}{2}\delta^i z_t^w -\frac{1}{2}\gamma z_t^i$  are decreasing in the volatility of the SDF. In other words, when the households' marginal utility growth is more volatile, they will impute a higher value to the risk-free asset and accept a lower risk-free interest rate. This effect is usually referred to as the precautionary saving motive.

The linear term  $\mu_t^i$  is a free parameter because the no-arbitrage approach does not take a stance on the investors' preferences. In consumption-based models, this term usually reflects the investors' subjective discount rate and the expected growth rate of their consumption. Specifically, if the expected growth rate of consumption is higher, then, investors tend to require a higher risk-free rate to save. This effect is usually referred to as the intertemporal smoothing motive. As we will see in Chapter 6, this linear term also reflects monetary or fiscal policies.

To operationalize this model, we need to take a stance on the  $\mu_t^i$  term. Motivated by the connection between the interest rates with currency risk premia, we further assume

$$
\mu_ {t} ^ {i} = \alpha + \chi z _ {t} ^ {i} + \chi z _ {t} ^ {w}.
$$

Then, the interest rate differential can be expressed as

$$
r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$} = \frac {1}{2} \left(\delta^ {\$} - \delta^ {i}\right) z _ {t} ^ {w} - \left(\frac {1}{2} \gamma - \chi\right) \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {\$}\right), \tag {3.5}
$$

which implies that the interest rate differential also comoves with the global and country-specific risk premia. A country with a higher loading  $\delta^i$  on the global shock has a lower interest rate, in addition to having a lower risk premium. Moreover, if  $\frac{1}{2}\gamma -\chi >0$ , which means that the interest rate is not set high enough to offset the precautionary saving motive, then, a country with a higher idiosyncratic volatility  $z_{t}^{i}$  also has a lower interest rate, in addition to having a lower risk premium.

This positive relationship between the interest rate differential and the currency risk premium holds both across countries and over time. We next explore these two dimensions in detail.

# 3.A.3 Carry Trade and Cross-Sectional Variations in Currency Risk Premium

To begin with, let us write down the log currency risk premium from Eq. (3.4) and the interest rate differential from Eq. (3.5):

$$
r p _ {t} ^ {i / \mathbb {S}} = \frac {1}{2} \left(\delta^ {\mathbb {S}} - \delta^ {i}\right) z _ {t} ^ {w} + \frac {1}{2} \gamma \left(z _ {t} ^ {\mathbb {S}} - z _ {t} ^ {i}\right),
$$

$$
r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S} = \frac {1}{2} (\delta^ {\S} - \delta^ {i}) z _ {t} ^ {w} - (\frac {1}{2} \gamma - \chi) (z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {\S}).
$$

In this subsection, we focus on the cross-country heterogeneity in the parameter  $\delta^i$ , which captures each foreign currency's loading on the global shock. This parameter appears in both expressions with the same sign: if a country has a higher loading  $\delta^i$  on the global shock, then, its currency risk premium and its interest rate are both lower.

Empirically, we need to find a way to estimate the systematic risk loading parameter  $\delta^i$ . To do so, we construct the carry trade. We sort currencies into portfolios based on their interest rates. We use  $H$  to denote the basket of currencies with high interest rates, and  $L$  to denote the basket of currencies with low interest rates. The portfolio composition can change over time. The carry trade factor  $hml$  is defined as

$$
h m l _ {t + 1} = \frac {1}{N _ {H}} \sum_ {i \in H} r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} - \frac {1}{N _ {L}} \sum_ {i \in L} r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S},
$$

where  $N_{H}$  and  $N_{L}$  denote the number of currencies in each portfolio. We let  $\sqrt{\delta_t^I}$  denote the equal-weighted average of  $\sqrt{\delta_t^i}$  across all currencies  $i$  in portfolio  $I$ .

This carry trade factor has three notable properties. First, the innovation to the carry trade factor is a scaled version of the global shock:

$$
h m l _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ h m l _ {t + 1} \right] = \left(\overline {{\sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {L}}}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {H}}}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w}.
$$

If we assume that the idiosyncratic volatility  $z_{t}^{i}$  is independent across countries and has the same time-series dynamics (for example, AR(1)), then, Eq. (3.5) implies that higher interest rate currencies tend to have lower  $\delta^{i}$ , and vice versa. Then,  $\sqrt{\delta_t^L} - \sqrt{\delta_t^H} > 0$ , which implies that the carry trade factor  $hml_{t+1}$  has a positive loading on the global shock.

Second, by being exposed to the global shock, the carry trade factor earns a positive risk premium on average:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ h m l _ {t + 1} \right] = \frac {1}{2} \left(\overline {{\delta_ {t} ^ {L}}} - \overline {{\delta_ {t} ^ {H}}}\right) z _ {t} ^ {w} > 0.
$$

In other words, the currency trading strategy that buys high interest rate currencies and sells low interest rate currencies earns a positive risk premium on average.

Third, each currency's loading on the carry trade factor informs us about its systematic risk exposure. Consider the conditional regression

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} = \alpha_ {t} ^ {i} + \beta_ {t} ^ {i} \cdot h m l _ {t + 1} + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

with  $\beta_t^i$  defined as

$$
\beta_ {t} ^ {i} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {\operatorname {c o v} _ {t} (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \mathbb {S}}, h m l _ {t + 1})}{v a r _ {t} (h m l _ {t + 1})}.
$$

We have the following result:

Proposition 3.1. Currency  $i$ 's carry trade beta is

$$
\beta_ {t} ^ {i} = \frac {\sqrt {\delta^ {\S}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {i}}}{\sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {L}} - \sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {H}}}.
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.3. Since  $\sqrt{\delta_t^L}$  and  $\sqrt{\delta_t^H}$  are common to all currencies, and  $\sqrt{\delta_t^L} > \sqrt{\delta_t^H}$ , then, the carry trade beta  $\beta_t^i$  is decreasing in the country's loading  $\delta^i$  on the global shock.

This proposition connects the currencies' risk exposures to their risk premia, incarnating the standard asset pricing logic that each asset's risk exposure can be measured from its covariance with risk factors, i.e.,

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = \alpha^ {i} + \beta_ {t} ^ {i} \cdot f _ {t + 1} + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

and that the risk exposure determines the asset's risk premium, i.e.,

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} ] = \beta_ {t} ^ {i} \cdot \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ f _ {t + 1} ],
$$

assuming that the factors are tradable. In the context of the currency market, the carry trade captures a risk factor:  $f_{t + 1} = hml_{t + 1}$ . The carry trade beta  $\beta_t^i$  captures the risk exposure of currency  $i$ , and it relates to the currency's risk premium via Eq. (3.4), which is increasing in  $\beta_t^i$ .

# 3.A.4 Forward Premium Puzzle and Time-Series Variations in Currency Risk Premium

Let us return to the expressions for the log currency risk premium and the interest rate differential between the dollar and a given for-

eign currency  $i$  ..

$$
r p _ {t} ^ {i / \S} = \frac {1}{2} \left(\delta^ {\S} - \delta^ {i}\right) z _ {t} ^ {w} + \frac {1}{2} \gamma \left(z _ {t} ^ {\S} - z _ {t} ^ {i}\right),
$$

$$
r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S} = \frac {1}{2} (\delta^ {\S} - \delta^ {i}) z _ {t} ^ {w} - (\frac {1}{2} \gamma - \chi) (z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {\S}).
$$

In this subsection, we turn to the time-series variation in the variances of the SDF shocks  $z_{t}^{w}$  and  $z_{t}^{i}$ , which drive variations in both the currency risk premium and the interest rate differential over time. As we will show in the following proposition, this common variation gives rise to predictive power of the interest rate differential for the currency excess return. Specifically, we compute the slope coefficient in the forecasting regression of the currency excess return on the interest rate differential:

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \$} = \alpha^ {i} + \varphi^ {i} (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$}) + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

with the Fama regression coefficient  $\varphi^i$  defined as

$$
\varphi^ {i} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {\operatorname {c o v} (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \mathbb {S}}, r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\mathbb {S}})}{\operatorname {v a r} (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\mathbb {S}})}.
$$

Proposition 3.2. The slope coefficient from the regression of the currency excess return on the interest rate differential is given by

$$
\varphi^ {i} = \frac {\frac {1}{2} \gamma (\frac {1}{2} \gamma - \chi) (v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + v a r (z _ {t} ^ {\$})) + \frac {1}{4} (\delta^ {\$} - \delta^ {i}) ^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {w})}{(\chi - \frac {1}{2} \gamma) ^ {2} (v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + v a r (z _ {t} ^ {\$})) + \frac {1}{4} (\delta^ {\$} - \delta^ {i}) ^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {w})},
$$

which is positive if  $\frac{1}{2}\gamma -\chi >0$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.4. This proposition shows that the exposures to both the global and the country-specific SDF shocks induce comovements between the interest rate differential and the currency excess return. Specifically, a country's interest rate declines when the global SDF volatility goes up and, if we assume  $\frac{1}{2}\gamma -\chi >0$ , when its idiosyncratic SDF volatility goes up. Both SDF components generate a positive slope coefficient in this regression, which rationalizes the UIP violation in the data.

Similarly, we can replace the currency excess return on the left-hand side of the regression with the exchange rate movement:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} = \alpha^ {i} + \psi^ {i} (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S}) + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i}.
$$

Its slope coefficient is given by

$$
\psi^ {i} \stackrel {{\text {d e f}}} {{=}} \frac {c o v (\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} , r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S})}{v a r (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S})} = \frac {\chi (\frac {1}{2} \gamma - \chi) (v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + v a r (z _ {t} ^ {\S}))}{(\chi - \frac {1}{2} \gamma) ^ {2} (v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + v a r (z _ {t} ^ {\S})) + \frac {1}{4} (\delta^ {\S} - \delta^ {i}) ^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {w})},
$$

which is also positive if  $\frac{1}{2}\gamma - \chi > 0$  and  $\chi > 0$ . In other words, when  $\chi > 0$ , the interest rate differential does not fully reflect the currency risk premium that is driven by the idiosyncratic SDF volatility in this model, so that the expected exchange rate movement also co-moves with the risk premium.

In models with richer structures, it is possible that the global SDF volatility  $z_{t}^{w}$  also drives the expected exchange rate movement. For example, this happens when the drift term in the SDF is

$$
\mu_ {t} ^ {i} = \alpha + \chi z _ {t} ^ {i} + \zeta \delta^ {i} z _ {t} ^ {w},
$$

for  $0 < \zeta < 1/2$ . In this case, while the currency risk premium loads on  $\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta^{\S} - \delta^{i}\right)$  times the global shock's volatility  $z_{t}^{w}$ , i.e.,

$$
r p _ {t} ^ {i / \S} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} \right] = \frac {1}{2} \left(\delta^ {\S} - \delta^ {i}\right) z _ {t} ^ {w} + \frac {1}{2} \gamma \left(z _ {t} ^ {\S} - z _ {t} ^ {i}\right),
$$

the interest rate differential only loads on (ζ - 1/2) (δi - δ$) times the global shock's volatility ztw:

$$
r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S} = \left(\zeta - \frac {1}{2}\right) \left(\delta^ {i} - \delta^ {\S}\right) z _ {t} ^ {w} + \left(\chi - \frac {1}{2} \gamma\right) \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {\S}\right),
$$

which does not fully reflect this global component of the currency risk premium.

As a result, the expected exchange rate movement also loads on the global SDF volatility  $z_{t}^{w}$ . This might be a more realistic specification since the global SDF volatility also induces exchange rate predictability by the interest rate differential:

$$
\psi^ {i} = \frac {c o v (\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} , r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S})}{v a r (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S})} = \frac {\chi \left(\frac {1}{2} \gamma - \chi\right) (v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + v a r (z _ {t} ^ {\S})) + \zeta \left(\frac {1}{2} - \zeta\right) (\delta^ {i} - \delta^ {\S}) ^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {w})}{(\chi - \frac {1}{2} \gamma) ^ {2} (v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + v a r (z _ {t} ^ {\S})) + (\zeta - \frac {1}{2}) ^ {2} (\delta^ {i} - \delta^ {\S}) ^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {w})} > 0.
$$

# 3.A.5 Currency Base Factor

Another convenient construct to measure risk exposures and currency risk premia is the currency base factor [Lustig and Richmond, 2020, Aloosh and Bekaert, 2021]. For country  $i$ , its currency base factor is defined as the average of its bilateral exchange rate movement against foreign currencies<sup>2</sup>:

$$
\Delta \bar {e} _ {t} ^ {i} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \Delta e _ {t} ^ {i / j}.
$$

This construct conveniently captures a currency's average exchange rate movement. For example, the dollar index is commonly

2 Some authors use an alternative definition  $\Delta \overline{e}_t^i = \frac{1}{N - 1}\sum_{i\neq j}\Delta e_t^{i / j}$ . Since  $\Delta e_t^{i / i} = 0$ , these two definitions of currency base factors only differ by a constant scalar  $N / (N - 1)$ . We use the definition in the main text since it computes simpler averages.

used in practice to reflect the overall strength of the U.S. dollar. The dollar's base factor  $\Delta \overline{e}_t^{\S}$  is the unweighted version of the dollar index.

By the law of large numbers, the SDF structure in Section 3.A implies

$$
\Delta \overline {{e}} _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \overline {{m}} _ {t + 1} = - \chi \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} - \overline {{z}} _ {t}\right) - \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

which measures currency  $i$ 's exposures to the global shock  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{w}$  and to its own idiosyncratic shock  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{i}$ , in a way that is invariant to the choice of the base currency  $j$ . As such, if we want to study the variation in the dollar, the dollar's base factor might be more informative than the dollar's bilateral exchange rate against an individual foreign currency.

For example, the conditional and the unconditional variances of the currency base factor can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l} v a r _ {t} (\Delta \bar {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}) = \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta}}}\right) ^ {2} z _ {t} ^ {w} + \gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}, \\ v a r (\Delta \overline {{e}} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}) = \chi^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta}}}\right) ^ {2} \theta^ {w} + \gamma \theta , \\ \end{array}
$$

which uncovers this currency's idiosyncratic variance  $z_{t}^{i}$  and its exposure to the global shock  $\delta^i$ .

Moreover, Lustig and Richmond [2020] also consider the following regression:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / j} = \alpha + \varphi^ {i / j} \Delta \bar {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {i} + \varepsilon_ {t + 1}.
$$

If the idiosyncratic volatility  $z^j$  follows the same distribution specified in Eq. (3.2), then,  $\bar{z}_t = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}z_t^i$  is time-invariant, and we have the following result characterizing the slope coefficient  $\varphi^{i/j}$ :

Proposition 3.3. The slope coefficient  $\varphi$  in this regression is given by

$$
\varphi^ {i / j} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {\operatorname {c o v} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / j} , \Delta \bar {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}\right)}{\operatorname {v a r} \left(\Delta \bar {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}\right)} = \frac {\chi^ {2} \operatorname {v a r} (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {j}}\right) \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta}}}\right) \theta^ {w} + \gamma \theta}{\chi^ {2} \operatorname {v a r} (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta}}}\right) ^ {2} \theta^ {w} + \gamma \theta}.
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.5. We note that the only foreign country  $j$ -specific variable in this expression is its exposure to the systematic risk,  $\delta^j$ . In particular, its idiosyncratic risk  $z_t^j$  does not show up in this expression, because the currency base factor  $\Delta \overline{e}_{t+1}^i$  is not exposed to any individual foreign country's idiosyncratic shock. Hence, for a given home currency  $i$ , the regression coefficient  $\varphi^{i/j}$  measures the difference in the systematic risk exposure between countries  $i$  and  $j$ , i.e.,  $\left(\sqrt{\delta^i} - \sqrt{\delta^j}\right)$ .

# 3.A.6 Other Works

This no-arbitrage approach provides a useful framework to account for the time-series and the cross-sectional variations in exchange rate movements and currency risk premia using global and idiosyncratic SDF shocks in complete markets. As such, it could be applied to all complete-market models that we study in this chapter.

We can and should introduce additional systematic risk factors in this no-arbitrage framework. Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan [2014], Verdelhan [2018] study a richer factor model of exchange rates with two common factors, one of which is related to the currency carry trade that we study in this section, and the other is related to the U.S. dollar. To generate this structure, the SDF is exposed to both common factors:

$$
m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = - \mu_ {t} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\delta^ {i} z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \sqrt {\kappa^ {i} z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {g} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

where the common shock  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{w}$  is tied to the currency carry trade return and the other common shock  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{g}$  is tied to the U.S. dollar. The loadings are time-varying, with the loadings on the dollar shock and on the idiosyncratic shock both tied to a local state variable  $z_{t}^{i}$  and the loading on the carry trade shock tied to a global state variable  $z_{t}^{w}$ .

We can also bring the SDF dynamics closer to the data. If the global and the country-specific shocks load on a vector of observable variables, we can model the SDF process using a VAR representation. For example, suppose the state vector  $x_{t}^{i}$  follows a VAR(1) process:

$$
x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = \Psi x _ {t} ^ {i} + \Sigma^ {1 / 2} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i},
$$

and the SDF innovations depend on the same VAR shocks  $\varepsilon_{t + 1}^{i}$ :

$$
m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = - r _ {t} ^ {i} - \frac {1}{2} (\lambda_ {t} ^ {i}) ^ {\prime} \lambda_ {t} ^ {i} - (\lambda_ {t} ^ {i}) ^ {\prime} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i}.
$$

The vector of loadings  $\lambda_t^i$  generalizes the scalar loadings  $\sqrt{\delta^iz_t^w}$  and  $\sqrt{\gamma z_t^i}$  in the previous case, and, for tractability, they are linear in the state vector  $x_i^i$ :

$$
\lambda_ {t} ^ {i} = \lambda_ {0} ^ {i} + \lambda_ {1} ^ {i} x _ {t} ^ {i}.
$$

This affine structure allows us to derive the asset prices in domestic bond and equity markets in closed form. Assuming complete markets, the exchange rate movement can be expressed as

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} = m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {\S}.
$$

In this way, we can jointly model exchange rates and asset prices using the same set of observable variables [Chernov and Creal, 2023]. We will discuss this class of affine models in detail in Section 8.E.

# 3.B Currency Risk Premia in the Time Series

The no-arbitrage approach offers us an accounting framework to break down the variations that come from country-specific and global shocks. Using the Euler equations, it imposes discipline on how these shocks give rise to variations in exchange rates and currency risk premia, and helps us organize the exchange rate puzzles. However, it does not answer where these shocks come from. We need additional structures to understand the origins of these shocks. In this section and the next section, we consider two models that offer such structures. One model is based on the long-run risks and focuses on the time-series variations in currency risk premia, and the other model is based on the trade network and focuses on the cross-sectional variations in currency risk premia.

# 3.B.1 Households

There are two countries, home and foreign. The households have the Epstein and Zin [1989] recursive preferences. For the home households,

$$
v _ {t} = \left\{(1 - \delta) \left(c _ {t}\right) ^ {1 - \frac {1}{\psi}} + \delta \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \left(v _ {t + 1}\right) ^ {1 - \gamma} \right] ^ {\frac {1 - \frac {1}{\psi}}{1 - \gamma}} \right\} ^ {\frac {1}{1 - \frac {1}{\psi}}}, \tag {3.6}
$$

where  $\gamma$  is the coefficient of risk aversion and  $\psi$  is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, and  $\delta$  is the coefficient of time-preference.  $C_t$  is consumption at time  $t$ . It is convenient to define  $\theta = \frac{1 - \gamma}{1 - \frac{1}{\psi}}$  and

simplify Eq. (3.6) as  $v_{t} = \left\{(1 - \delta)c_{t}^{\frac{1 - \gamma}{\theta}} + \mathbb{E}_{t}[(u_{t + 1})^{1 - \gamma}]^{\frac{1}{\theta}}\right\}^{\frac{\theta}{1 - \gamma}}$ .

Consumption growth has a long-run component  $x_{t}$ , which is small, very persistent, and has stochastic volatility:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta c _ {t + 1} = \mu_ {g} + x _ {t} + \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1}, \\ x _ {t + 1} = \rho x _ {t} + \varphi_ {e} \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1}, \\ \sigma_ {t + 1} ^ {2} = \sigma^ {2} + \phi (\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}) + \omega \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The consumption growth shock  $\varepsilon_{g,t + 1}$ , the long-run growth shock  $\varepsilon_{x,t + 1}$ , and the long-run growth volatility shock  $\varepsilon_{w,t + 1}$  are jointly normal. We assume that long-run and short-run consumption shocks are correlated:  $cov_{t}(\varepsilon_{g,t + 1},\varepsilon_{x,t + 1}) = \nu$ . For simplicity, we assume  $cov_{t}(\varepsilon_{x,t + 1},\varepsilon_{w,t + 1}) = 0$ ,  $cov_{t}(\varepsilon_{g,t + 1},\varepsilon_{w,t + 1}) = 0$ .

Let  $w_{t}$  denote the aggregate wealth, which is the claim to current and future consumption. Let  $wc_{t} = w_{t} / c_{t}$  denote the wealth consumption ratio. We can define the cum-dividend return on this

claim as

$$
\exp (r _ {t + 1} ^ {c}) = \frac {w _ {t + 1}}{w _ {t} - c _ {t}} = \frac {c _ {t + 1}}{c _ {t}} \frac {w c _ {t + 1}}{w c _ {t} - 1}.
$$

Using the Campbell-Shiller log-linearization of the log total wealth return around the long-run average log wealth consumption ratio  $\mu_{wc} = \mathbb{E}[\log (wc_t)]$ :

$$
r _ {t + 1} ^ {c} = \kappa_ {0} ^ {c} + \Delta c _ {t + 1} + \log \left(w c _ {t + 1}\right) - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c} \log \left(w c _ {t}\right), \tag {3.7}
$$

with  $\kappa_1^c = \frac{e^{\mu wc}}{e^{\mu wc} - 1} > 1$  and  $\kappa_0^c = -\log(e^{\mu wc} - 1) + \frac{e^{\mu wc}}{e^{\mu wc} - 1}\mu_{wc}$ .

Epstein and Zin [1989] show that the log SDF  $m_{t+1}$  can be expressed as

$$
m _ {t + 1} = \theta \log \delta - \frac {\theta}{\psi} \Delta c _ {t + 1} + (\theta - 1) r _ {t + 1} ^ {c},
$$

which depends on not only the log consumption growth  $\Delta c_{t+1}$ , but also the log return on the wealth portfolio  $r_{t+1}^c$ . The following proposition shows that the log wealth-consumption ratio and the log SDF are linear functions of the state variables after the log-linearization.

Proposition 3.4. The log wealth-consumption ratio  $\log(wc_{t})$  is affine in  $x_{t}$  and  $\sigma_{t}^{2}$ :

$$
\log \left(w c _ {t}\right) = \mu_ {w c} + W _ {x} x _ {t} + W _ {\sigma} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}\right), \tag {3.8}
$$

where

$$
W _ {x} = \frac {1 - \frac {1}{\psi}}{\kappa_ {1} ^ {c} - \rho},
$$

$$
W _ {\sigma} = \frac {(1 - \gamma) \left(1 - \frac {1}{\psi}\right)}{2 (\kappa_ {1} ^ {c} - \phi)} \left(\frac {\varphi_ {e} ^ {2}}{(\kappa_ {1} ^ {c} - \rho) ^ {2}} + \frac {2 \nu \varphi_ {e}}{\kappa_ {1} ^ {c} - \rho} + 1\right),
$$

and the log SDF can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l} m _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] = - \gamma \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} + (\theta - 1) W _ {x} \sigma_ {t} \varphi_ {e} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} + (\theta - 1) W _ {\sigma} \omega \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1}, \\ \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] = \theta \log \delta + (\theta - 1) r _ {0} ^ {c} - \frac {\theta}{\psi} \mu_ {g} + \left\{- \frac {\theta}{\psi} + (\theta - 1) [ 1 + W _ {x} (\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) ] \right\} x _ {t} + \{W _ {\sigma} (\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) (\theta - 1) \} (\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}). \\ \end{array}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.6. To interpret this result, we provide a simple calibration of the model following Bansal and Shaliastovich [2007]. The parameter values are reported in Table 3.1. The only modification is that we assume the correlation between long-run and short-run consumption shocks, i.e.,  $cov_{t}(\varepsilon_{g,t + 1},\varepsilon_{x,t + 1}) = \nu$ , to be negative.

At the bottom of the table, we report the values of the key equilibrium objects in this model. Given that  $W_{x} > 0$  and  $W_{\sigma} < 0$ , the

wealth-consumption ratio is increasing in the long-run growth and decreasing in the volatility. Similarly, we can show that the SDF  $m_{t+1}$  is decreasing in the short-run consumption shock  $\varepsilon_{g,t+1}$ , decreasing in the long-run consumption shock  $\varepsilon_{x,t+1}$ , and increasing in the volatility shock  $\varepsilon_{w,t+1}$ .

# 3.B.2 Macro Synthesis

It is worth noting that this model does not start with endowment or production processes and household optimization that generate endogenous consumption processes. Instead, the consumption processes are assumed to be exogenous. Subsequent works such as Colacito and Croce [2013], Colacito, Croce, Ho, and Howard [2018b] embed the long-run risk in the endowment or production processes instead of the consumption processes. While these alternative settings bring the model closer to the baseline model we considered in Section 1.A, it also makes the model more difficult to solve and

requires us to rely on numerical solutions.

In this long-run risk model we considered, the exogenous variables include the short-run consumption growth shocks, the long-run consumption growth shocks, and the variance shocks:

$$
\left(\varepsilon_ {g, t}, \varepsilon_ {g, t} ^ {*}, \varepsilon_ {x, t}, \varepsilon_ {x, t} ^ {*}, \varepsilon_ {w, t}, \varepsilon_ {w, t} ^ {*}\right) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}.
$$

There are 7 endogenous variables in each period  $t$ :

$$
\left(m _ {t}, r _ {t} ^ {c}, w c _ {t}, m _ {t} ^ {*}, r _ {t} ^ {c *}, w c _ {t} ^ {*}, e _ {t}\right) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}.
$$

The model implies the following 6 equations in each period, including 3 for the home country in period  $t$ ,

$$
r _ {t + 1} ^ {c} = \kappa_ {0} ^ {c} + \Delta c _ {t + 1} + \log (w c _ {t + 1}) - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c} \log (w c _ {t}),
$$

$$
m _ {t + 1} = \theta \log \delta - \frac {\theta}{\psi} \Delta c _ {t + 1} + (\theta - 1) r _ {t + 1} ^ {c},
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t + 1} ^ {c}) ],
$$

and 3 for the Foreign country in period  $t$

$$
r _ {t + 1} ^ {c *} = \kappa_ {0} ^ {c *} + \Delta c _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \log \left(w c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c *} \log \left(w c _ {t} ^ {*}\right),
$$

$$
m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} = \theta \log \delta - \frac {\theta}{\psi} \Delta c _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + (\theta - 1) r _ {t + 1} ^ {c *},
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t + 1} ^ {c *}\right) \right],
$$

Moreover, we assume that the markets are complete, so we have one more equation that relates the exchange rate movement to the SDFs:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}.
$$

# 3.B.3 Exchange Rate Dynamics

Now that we obtain a simple solution of the SDF, we are ready to characterize the exchange rate dynamics.

Proposition 3.5. Assuming complete markets, the real exchange rate movement is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta e _ {t + 1} = \left\{- \frac {\theta}{\psi} + (\theta - 1) [ 1 + W _ {x} (\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) ] \right\} (x _ {t} - x _ {t} ^ {*}) + \left\{W _ {\sigma} (\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) (\theta - 1) \right\} (\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma_ {t} ^ {* 2}) \\ - \gamma (\sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} - \sigma_ {t} ^ {*} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} ^ {*}) + (\theta - 1) W _ {x} \varphi_ {e} (\sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} - \sigma_ {t} ^ {*} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} ^ {*}) + (\theta - 1) W _ {\sigma} \omega (\varepsilon_ {w, t + 1} - \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1} ^ {*}), \\ \end{array}
$$

the currency risk premium is

$$
\begin{array}{l} r p _ {t} \stackrel {{d e f}} {{=}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] = \frac {1}{2} (v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) - v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1})) \\ = \frac {1}{2} \left[ \gamma^ {2} + (\theta - 1) ^ {2} W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi_ {e} ^ {2} - 2 \nu \gamma (\theta - 1) W _ {x} \varphi_ {e} \right] (\sigma_ {t} ^ {* 2} - \sigma_ {t} ^ {2}), \\ \end{array}
$$

the interest rate differential is

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*} = \left(- \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1})\right) - \left(- \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*})\right) \\ = \left\{- \frac {\theta}{\psi} + (\theta - 1) [ 1 + W _ {x} (\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) ] \right\} \left(x _ {t} ^ {*} - x _ {t}\right) \\ + \left\{W _ {\sigma} (\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) (\theta - 1) + \frac {1}{2} \gamma^ {2} + \frac {1}{2} (\theta - 1) ^ {2} W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi^ {2} - \nu \gamma (\theta - 1) W _ {x} \varphi \right\} (\sigma_ {t} ^ {* 2} - \sigma_ {t} ^ {2}), \\ \end{array}
$$

and the Backus-Smith coefficient is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \beta_ {t} ^ {B S} = \frac {\operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} , \Delta c _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \Delta c _ {t + 1}\right)}{\operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta c _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \Delta c _ {t + 1}\right)} \\ = \gamma + \nu \frac {\varphi_ {e} (1 - \theta) W _ {x}}{v a r _ {t} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {*} \varepsilon_ {g , t + 1} ^ {*} - \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g , t + 1}\right)} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {t} ^ {* 2}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.7. When the markets are complete, we have a simple mapping from the SDF shocks to exchange rate movements. Specifically, as negative home short-run and long-run consumption shocks and positive home volatility shocks raise the marginal utilities of home households, they lead to home currency appreciation. In comparison, the home currency's risk premium only depends on the second-order moments, and it is decreasing in home consumption volatility and increasing in foreign consumption volatility.

The interest rate differential also loads negatively on home consumption volatility, which is also driven by a higher precautionary saving when home consumption volatility is high. In this way, the stochastic volatility drives common movements in currency risk premia and interest rate differentials, giving rise to an explanation of the forward premium puzzle.

Finally, the correlation between long-run and short-run consumption shocks  $\nu$  plays a key role in the Backus-Smith coefficient. Consider the following benchmark: suppose the consumption growth process has no long-run growth or stochastic volatility:  $\Delta c = \mu_g + \sigma_g\varepsilon_{g,t + 1}$ . Then, the Backus-Smith coefficient is

$$
\beta_ {t} ^ {B S} = \frac {- (\theta (1 - \frac {1}{\psi}) - 1) \sigma_ {g} ^ {2} v a r _ {t} ((\varepsilon_ {g , t + 1} ^ {*} - \varepsilon_ {g , t + 1})))}{\sigma_ {g} ^ {2} v a r _ {t} ((\varepsilon_ {g , t + 1} ^ {*} - \varepsilon_ {g , t + 1}))} = \gamma ,
$$

which is always positive.

In our calibration, the term  $\frac{\varphi_e(1 - \theta)W_x}{\text{var}_t(\sigma_t^*e_{g,t + 1}^*) - \sigma_t\varepsilon_{g,t + 1}}$  ( $\sigma_t^2 +\sigma_t^{*2}$ ) is always positive. So, a negative correlation between long-run and short-run consumption shocks  $\nu$  lowers the Backus-Smith coefficient below  $\gamma$ . In fact, this correlation is negative enough in our calibration, which gives rise to a negative Backus-Smith coefficient. In other words,

when the long-run consumption shock goes in the opposite direction than the short-run consumption shock, it disentangles the link between the spot consumption growth and marginal utilities: a higher short-run consumption growth at the expense of lowering long-run growth is bad news. It raises marginal utilities and leads to currency appreciation.

This is the key mechanism emphasized by Colacito and Croce [2013], who also provide a reason for the negative correlation: an increase in the home households' long-run consumption growth leads to an increase in their continuation utility and a decline in their marginal utility. With perfect risk-sharing, the social planner should reduce the spot consumption allocated to the home country, leading to a decline in the home households' short-run consumption growth. At the same time, these resources flow to the foreign country that receives relatively worse news.

# 3.B.4 Other Works

Colacito and Croce [2011], Bansal and Shaliastovich [2013] consider similar settings with exogenously given consumption dynamics. Bansal and Shaliastovich [2013] further consider the inflation dynamics, which allows them to price nominal bonds and exchange rates. Colacito and Croce [2013], Colacito, Croce, Ho, and Howard [2018b] embed this setting in endowment economies with long-run risks and recursive preferences. Colacito, Croce, Gavazzoni, and Ready [2018a] introduce heterogeneity in the risk loadings of different countries' long-run consumption shocks.

Parallel to the long-run risk model, other models have also been proposed to describe the dynamics of currency risk premia, such as habit formation [Verdelhan, 2010, Heyerdahl-Larsen, 2014, Stathopoulos, 2017], demand shocks [Pavlova and Rigobon, 2007], rare disasters [Farhi and Gabaix, 2016].

# 3.C Currency Risk Premia in the Cross-Section

The literature on international finance has also provided several mechanisms that generate persistent differences in currency risk premia across currencies. These mechanisms help explain the carry trade and the factor structure in currency returns. In this section, we consider such a mechanism based on the global trade network [Richmond, 2019] and Jiang and Richmond [2023b] in particular. This approach is based on a large literature in macro that studies production networks [Long Jr and Plosser, 1983, Foerster, Sarte, and Watson, 2011, Gabaix, 2011, Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar, and

Tahbaz-Salehi, 2012, Chaney, 2014, Baqaae and Farhi, 2019].

Time is discrete and infinite, indexed by  $t$ . There is no storage technology that allows agents to transfer goods across periods. There are  $N$  countries, each populated by a unit mass of households and indexed by  $i$ .

There are two types of goods: intermediate and final consumption goods. Each country has a distinct intermediate good that is used for the production of other intermediate goods. The active households undertake the production of intermediate goods in each country. Consumption goods are assembled as a basket of intermediate goods. We first turn to the production of intermediate goods.

# 3.C.1 Intermediate Goods and the Production Process

Households in each country produce a distinct intermediate tradable good using labor and tradable intermediate goods from different countries. Each active household in country  $i$  has an identical Cobb-Douglas production function of the form

$$
\bar {x} _ {t} ^ {i} = a _ {t} ^ {i} \left(\ell_ {t} ^ {i}\right) ^ {\theta^ {i}} \left(\prod_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(x _ {j t} ^ {i}\right) ^ {w _ {i j}}\right), \tag {3.9}
$$

where  $a_{t}^{i}$  is the productivity level,  $\ell_{t}^{i}$  is the labor input, and  $x_{jt}^{i}$  is the quantity of the intermediate goods produced by country  $j$  that are used as production inputs in country  $i$ . The parameter  $\theta^{i}$  measures the contribution of country  $i$ 's labor, and the parameters  $w_{ij}$  measure the contribution of each country  $j$ 's input. We assume that

$$
\theta^ {i} + \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} w _ {i j} = 1 \text {a n d} \theta^ {i}, w _ {i j} > 0,
$$

so that the production function has constant returns to scale. We collect the production parameters for intermediate goods  $w_{ij}$  into a matrix  $W$ .

# 3.C.2 Final Consumption Goods and Household Preferences

Households in country  $i$  assemble their final consumption good from different countries' intermediate goods. Let  $\bar{c}_{it}$  denote the active households' quantity of the final consumption good, which is derived from a Cobb-Douglas production function:

$$
\bar {c} _ {t} ^ {i} = \prod_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(c _ {j t} ^ {i}\right) ^ {v _ {i j}}, \tag {3.10}
$$

where  $c_{jt}^{i}$  is the quantity of the intermediate goods produced by country  $j$  used as the production inputs by  $i$ . The parameters satisfy

$$
\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} v _ {i j} = 1 \text {a n d} v _ {i j} > 0.
$$

We collect the production parameters for final goods  $v_{ij}$  into a matrix  $V$ . Along with the intermediate goods' production weights  $W$ , the matrix  $V$  will be a key source of international comovements in the model.

The households have log preferences over their aggregate consumption, and discount future utility at rate  $\beta$ . The utility function is

$$
\sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \log \overline {{c}} _ {t} ^ {i}.
$$

The households have access to complete financial markets, where they can trade contingent claims with the households in any country.

# 3.C.3 Market Clearing

We study the competitive equilibrium defined in the usual fashion: All households maximize their utilities taking prices as given, and market clearing conditions for each good and labor are satisfied.

The market clearing condition for country  $i$ 's intermediate good is

$$
\overline {{x}} _ {t} ^ {i} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(c _ {i t} ^ {j} + x _ {i t} ^ {j}\right) + d _ {t} ^ {i}.
$$

On the left-hand side, we have the total output of country  $i$ 's intermediate good. On the right-hand side, we have the demand for this good from each country's consumption and production sectors. We have an additional term  $d_{it}$  as a reduced-form proxy for demand shocks. This term can represent government taxation and spending as in Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr [2016], or within-country transfer to inactive/hand-to-mouth investors as in Jiang and Richmond [2023b].

Labor supply is fixed. The market clearing condition for country  $i$ 's labor is

$$
\ell_ {t} ^ {i} = \overline {{\ell}} ^ {i}.
$$

# 3.C.4 Macro Synthesis

The competitive equilibrium solution in complete market is characterized by the solution to a social planner's problem. The Lagrangian is

given by

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \pi^ {i} \log {\overline {{c}} _ {t} ^ {i}} + \varphi_ {t} ^ {i} \left(a _ {t} ^ {i} (\ell_ {t} ^ {i}) ^ {\theta^ {i}} \left(\prod_ {j = 1} ^ {N} (x _ {j t} ^ {i}) ^ {w _ {i j}}\right) - \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(c _ {i t} ^ {j} + x _ {i t} ^ {j}\right) - d _ {t} ^ {i}\right) + \chi^ {i} (\overline {{\ell}} ^ {i} - \ell_ {t} ^ {i}),
$$

The exogenous variables are the productivity shocks and the demand shocks:

$$
\left(a _ {t} ^ {i}, d _ {t} ^ {i}\right) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}, \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots , N.
$$

There are  $2N^{2} + 5N$  endogenous variables in each period  $t$ :

$$
(\overline {{c}} _ {t} ^ {i}, c _ {j t} ^ {i}, \overline {{x}} _ {t} ^ {i}, x _ {j t} ^ {i}, \ell_ {t} ^ {i}, \varphi_ {t} ^ {i}, \chi_ {t} ^ {i}) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}, i, j = 1, 2, \ldots , N.
$$

The model implies the following  $2N^{2} + 5N$  equations in each period, which includes  $N$  consumption aggregation equations

$$
\overline {{c}} _ {t} ^ {i} = \prod_ {j = 1} ^ {N} (c _ {j t} ^ {i}) ^ {v _ {i j}},
$$

$N$  production equations

$$
\overline {{x}} _ {t} ^ {i} = a _ {t} ^ {i} (\ell_ {t} ^ {i}) ^ {\theta^ {i}} \left(\prod_ {j = 1} ^ {N} (x _ {j t} ^ {i}) ^ {w _ {i j}}\right),
$$

$2N^{2} + N$  first-order conditions

w.r.t.  $c_{it}^{j}$  ：  $\pi^j v_{ji}(c_{it}^j)^{-1} = \varphi_t^i,$

w.r.t.  $x_{it}^{j}$ $\varphi_t^j\bar{x}_t^j w_{ji}(x_{it}^j)^{-1} = \varphi_t^i,$

w.r.t.  $\ell_{it}$  :  $\varphi_t^i\bar{x}_t^i\theta^i (\ell_t^i)^{-1} = \chi_t^i,$

$N$  intermediate good market clearing conditions

$$
\overline {{x}} _ {t} ^ {i} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(c _ {i t} ^ {j} + x _ {i t} ^ {j}\right) + d _ {t} ^ {i},
$$

$N$  labor market clearing conditions

$$
\ell_ {t} ^ {i} = \overline {{\ell}} ^ {i}.
$$

# 3.C.5 Trade Network and Shock Transmission

We next characterize the equilibrium of the model and show how the structure of global production transmits shocks across countries. A variable with its country index omitted is a vector. For example,  $\overline{c}_t$  is the vector where each element is  $\overline{c}_t^i$ . A capitalized parameter with two country indices omitted is a matrix. For example,  $W$  is the matrix with each element being  $w_{ij}$ .

Since the households have access to the complete markets, the competitive equilibrium can be characterized by the solution to a social planner's problem. Within period  $t$ , the social planner's Lagrangian is

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \pi^ {i} \log {\overline {{c}} _ {t} ^ {i}} + \varphi_ {t} ^ {i} \left(a _ {t} ^ {i} (\ell_ {t} ^ {i}) ^ {\theta^ {i}} \left(\prod_ {j = 1} ^ {N} (x _ {j t} ^ {i}) ^ {w _ {i j}}\right) - \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(c _ {i t} ^ {j} + x _ {i t} ^ {j}\right) - d _ {t} ^ {i}\right) + \chi_ {t} ^ {i} (\overline {{\ell}} ^ {i} - \ell_ {t} ^ {i}),
$$

where  $\pi^i$  is the Pareto weight that the social planner assigns to country  $i$ . This Pareto weight is determined by the initial level of wealth held by each country's households.

A key variable that emerges from the model is a function of trade network parameters for intermediate usages,  $W$ , and consumption,  $V$ . We define the network profile matrix as:

$$
H \equiv V (I - W) ^ {- 1}.
$$

Solving the planner's Lagrangian, we derive the following lemma to characterize the real quantities in equilibrium. We omit the time subscript for notational convenience.

Proposition 3.6. In equilibrium, the vector of each country's active households' log consumption is

$$
\log \bar {c} = \kappa^ {c} + H \left(\log a - \theta \log \left(H ^ {\prime} \pi + \left(I - W ^ {\prime}\right) ^ {- 1} d\right)\right), \tag {3.11}
$$

for some vector of constants  $\kappa^c$ .

The proof is presented in Appendix A.8. This result shows that the structure of the global trade network, summarized by the network profile matrix  $H = V(I - W)^{-1}$ , plays an important role in transmitting both the supply shocks ( $a$ ) and the demand shocks ( $d$ ). The network profile matrix combines the production trade network  $W$  and the consumption trade network  $V$ . The term  $(I - W)^{-1}$  is commonly known as the Leontief inverse, which summarizes the transmission of the productivity shocks. Loosely speaking,  $(I - W)^{-1} = I + W + W^2 + W^3 + \ldots$ , where  $W$  reflects the transmission from the exporting country to the importing country, and  $W^k$  for  $k > 1$  reflects the transmission of shocks due to higher order linkages.

Moreover, in this model, the supply shocks  $a$  are transmitted via the network matrix  $H = V(I - W)^{-1}$ , whereas the demand shocks  $d$  are first transmitted via the transpose of the production network, i.e.,  $(I - W')^{-1}$ . This is a general feature of network transmission. Intuitively, supply shocks propagate downstream, meaning that a productivity shock in one country impacts the production in other countries which import from this country. In comparison, demand

shocks propagate upstream, meaning that a demand shock in one country impacts the production in other countries which export to this country. The transpose operation reverses the direction of the trade linkages, so that the demand shocks are transmitted in the opposite direction of the production linkages.

Taking a first-order approximation, we can express the active households' log consumption growth as a linear function of the supply shocks  $\Delta \log a$  and the demand shocks  $\Delta d$ :

$$
\Delta \log \bar {c} \approx H \left(\Delta \log a - \frac {\theta}{H ^ {\prime} \pi} (I - W ^ {\prime}) ^ {- 1} \Delta d\right), \tag {3.12}
$$

where  $\frac{1}{H^{\prime}\pi}$  is a diagonal matrix whose element  $(i,i)$  is  $\frac{1}{\{H^{\prime}\pi\}_i}$ . This expression shows that each country's consumption growth is driven by a combination of demand and supply shocks of, potentially, all other countries globally. The specific combination of shocks that a country is exposed to is primarily determined by the structure of global trade linkages summarized by the network profile matrix  $H$ . This common exposure to country-level shocks that arises due to trade linkages gives rise to international comovements.

# 3.C.6 Characterizing Consumption and Exchange Rate Comovements

We are interested in characterizing international comovements in consumption growth and exchange rates. We define the bilateral log real exchange rate between countries  $i$  and  $j$ ,  $e_t^{i/j}$ , as the log price of country  $j$ 's consumption bundle per unit of country  $i$ 's consumption bundle. An increase in  $e_t^{i/j}$  implies an appreciation of country  $i$ 's real exchange rate relative to country  $j$ 's. Since markets are complete, the bilateral exchange rate movement is determined by the difference in the growth rates of marginal utilities:

$$
\Delta e _ {t} ^ {i / j} = \Delta \log \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {j} - \Delta \log \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {i}.
$$

We define each country's currency base factor,  $\Delta \bar{e}_{it}$ , as the equal-weighted average log real exchange rate change against all countries, including itself:

$$
\Delta \bar {e} _ {t} ^ {i} = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \Delta e _ {t} ^ {i / j}.
$$

Let  $Var[z]$  denote the variance-covariance matrix for a vector of stochastic variables  $z$ . We define a general measure of closeness between two countries  $i$  and  $j$  as

$$
\mathcal {C} (i, j) \equiv \left\{H \cdot V a r \left[ \Delta \log a - \frac {\theta}{H ^ {\prime} \pi} \left(I - W ^ {\prime}\right) ^ {- 1} \Delta d \right] \cdot H ^ {\prime} \right\} _ {i j}, \tag {3.13}
$$

which measures the pairwise similarity of the shocks which drive countries' quantities. Then, we obtain the following proposition:

Proposition 3.7. (a) Closer countries have more correlated active household consumption growth:

$$
c o v \left(\Delta \log \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {i}, \Delta \log \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {j}\right) = \mathcal {C} (i, j).
$$

(b) Closer countries have more correlated currency base factors and less volatile bilateral real exchange rate movements:

$$
c o v \left(\Delta \bar {e} _ {t} ^ {i}, \Delta \bar {e} _ {t} ^ {j}\right) = \mathcal {C} (i, j) - \overline {{\mathcal {C}}} (i) - \overline {{\mathcal {C}}} (j) + \kappa^ {e},
$$

$$
v a r (\Delta e _ {t} ^ {i / j}) = - 2 \mathcal {C} (i, j) + \mathcal {C} (i, i) + \mathcal {C} (j, j),
$$

where  $\kappa^e$  is a constant:

$$
\kappa^ {e} = \frac {1}{N ^ {2}} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\ell = 1} ^ {N} \mathcal {C} (k, \ell),
$$

and  $\overline{\mathcal{C}}(i)$  is the average closeness between country  $i$  and all countries:

$$
\overline {{\mathcal {C}}} (i) = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \mathcal {C} (i, j).
$$

(c) The variance of country  $i$ 's currency base factor is

$$
\operatorname {v a r} \left(\Delta \bar {e} _ {t} ^ {i}\right) = - 2 \overline {{\mathcal {C}}} (i) + \mathcal {C} (i, i) + \kappa^ {e}.
$$

Fixing its closeness to itself  $\mathcal{C}(i,i)$ , the country's currency base factor is less volatile if it has a higher average closeness.

The proof is presented in Appendix A.9. This proposition shows that the consumption and exchange rate covariance is directly related to the closeness matrix  $\mathcal{C}$ , which depends on both the covariance structures of supply and demand shocks as well as the structure of the trade network that propagates these shocks.

# 3.C.7 Currency Risk Premia and Endogenous Common Factors

We set the U.S. dollar as the base currency.

Proposition 3.8. Currency  $i$ 's expected excess return is

$$
\begin{array}{l} r p _ {t} ^ {i / \$} \stackrel {{d e f}} {{=}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \$} \right] = \frac {1}{2} (v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {\$}) - v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {i})) \\ = \frac {1}{2} \left(\mathcal {C} (\mathrm {\$}, \mathrm {\$}) - \mathcal {C} (i, i)\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

and its interest rate is

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t} ^ {i} = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} \right] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {i}\right) \\ = - \log \delta - \frac {1}{2} \mathcal {C} (i, i) \\ \end{array}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.10. This result shows that, fixing the base currency, a currency  $i$ 's risk premium is decreasing in its closeness to itself, i.e.,  $\mathcal{C}(i,i)$ . Following Richmond [2019], we may call this object country  $i$ 's trade centrality. The trade centrality summarizes how this country's position and relation to other countries in the trade network affects its currency risk premium. A country with a large  $\mathcal{C}(i,i)$  is a central country and has a low currency risk premium, whereas a country with a small  $\mathcal{C}(i,i)$  is a peripheral country and has a high currency risk premium.

We consider the following numerical example to understand what centrality captures. There are 4 countries. We assume the home bias in consumption tends to 1 in the limit, i.e.,  $V \rightarrow I$ , and that the combined supply and demand shocks are i.i.d. across countries,  $Var\left[\varepsilon^{S} - \frac{\theta}{H^{\prime}\pi}(I - W^{\prime})^{-1}\varepsilon^{D}\right] = Var[\varepsilon] = I$ . These simplifying assumptions allow us to focus on the production trade network  $W$ , which is given by

$$
W = (1 - \theta) \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0. 2 5 & 0. 7 5 & 0 & 0 \\ 0. 5 & 0 & 0. 5 & 0 \\ 0. 7 5 & 0 & 0 & 0. 2 5 \end{array} \right],
$$

with  $\theta = 0.5$

In this trade network, countries 2, 3, and 4 rely on country 1's export as intermediate input. The dependency is increasing from country 2 to 4. The implied centrality measure is

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c} \mathcal {C} (1, 1) \\ \mathcal {C} (2, 2) \\ \mathcal {C} (3, 3) \\ \mathcal {C} (4, 4) \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4. 0 0 \\ 2. 7 2 \\ 2. 2 2 \\ 2. 0 4 \end{array} \right],
$$

which implies that country 1 is the most central country because it provides essential production input to all other countries, and country 4 is the most peripheral country because it is very reliant on country 1's export. Accordingly, country 1's shock is the most systematic and as a result it has the lowest currency risk premium.

This simple network structure also gives rise to a factor structure in exchange rate movements. Let  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{(i)}$  denote the combined supply and demand shock in country  $i$ . Then, the bilateral exchange rate movements also load on these shocks:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {1 / 2} = - 1. 6 0 \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} + 1. 6 0 \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {(2)}, \\ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {1 / 3} = - 1. 3 3 \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} + 1. 3 3 \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {(3)}, \\ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {1 / 4} = - 1. 1 4 \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} + 1. 1 4 \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {(4)}, \\ \end{array}
$$

and the central country's shock  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{(1)}$  becomes the common factor in the cross-section of exchange rates. In fact, even when we consider the bilateral pair between countries 2 and 3 that does not involve the central country 1,  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{(1)}$  still shows up:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {2 / 3} = 0. 2 7 \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} - 1. 6 0 \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {(2)} + 1. 3 3 \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {(3)}.
$$

In comparison, all other (peripheral) countries' consumption load on this common factor, and have no further pairwise comovements beyond that induced by their exposure to the common factor. The shocks  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{(2)}, \varepsilon_{t+1}^{(3)}$ , and  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{(4)}$  are idiosyncratic in the sense that only one country is exposed to each of them.

This expression demonstrates how our general equilibrium model produces exchange rate dynamics like those found in factor models of exchange rates in Section 3.A. Specifically, country 1's shock becomes the global shock  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{w}$ , and other countries' shocks become country-specific shocks  $\varepsilon_{t+1}^{i}$ . In this way, common factors in exchange rates arise from the network propagation of independent shocks across countries. This example could also be generalized to allow for multiple factors once we impose a richer dependence structure in the consumption and production networks.

In the general model with dense input-output linkages in  $W$  and  $V$ , there are no truly idiosyncratic shocks, but some shocks are more important for the variation of quantities and asset prices, and this information can be summarized by the closeness measure.

# 3.C.8 Other Works

Other works explain cross-country differences in currency risk premia based on different mechanisms, such as size [Martin, 2011, Hassan, 2013], commodity goods [Ready, Roussanov, and Ward, 2017b,a], and financial intermediation and risk-bearing capacity [Maggiori, 2017, Wiriadinata, 2018, Fang, 2021].

# 3.C.9 A Note on Log Preference

In this model, we assume that agents have log preferences:  $u(c) = \log(c)$ . As with all modeling assumptions, this has pros and cons. In this context with Cobb-Douglas aggregation of goods, the key implication of the log preferences is that the households will allocate a constant share of their budget to each consumption goods. That is,

$$
\frac {c _ {i t} ^ {j}}{c ^ {k} j _ {i t}} = \frac {\pi^ {j} v _ {j i}}{\pi^ {k} v _ {k i}}
$$

is a constant.

If we aggregate this result across all countries, we can show that the value of a country's aggregate output in the common numétaire is

$$
\varphi_ {t} \bar {x} _ {t} = H ^ {\prime} \pi + (I - W ^ {\prime}) ^ {- 1} d _ {t},
$$

where  $\varphi_t\overline{x}_t$  is a vector whose  $i$ -th element is  $\varphi_t^i\overline{x}_t^i$ . That is, supply shocks  $a_{t}$  do not affect the value of a country's aggregate output; only demand shocks do. This is because, while a higher supply shock raises the quantity of a country's output, it proportionally lowers its price, so that the value of the output is unchanged [Cole and Obstfeld, 1991]. In contrast, a higher demand shock raises the price of the local goods while leaving the quantity unchanged, so that the value of the output increases.

While this is a strong assumption, it is technically convenient. From the production equations (3.9) and the social planner's first-order conditions, the country-level production quantities satisfy

$$
\log \bar {x} _ {t} ^ {i} = \log a _ {t} ^ {i} + \theta^ {i} \log \ell_ {t} ^ {i} + \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} w _ {i j} \log \left(\frac {\varphi_ {t} ^ {i} \bar {x} _ {t} ^ {i} w _ {i j}}{\varphi_ {t} ^ {j} \bar {x} _ {t} ^ {j} / \bar {x} _ {t} ^ {j}}\right),
$$

which allows us to solve the vector of the production quantity  $\log \overline{x}_t$  as a linear transformation of the vector of the production value  $\log (\varphi_t\bar{x}_t)$ , and obtain a closed-form characterization of the equilibrium allocations.

This discussion centers on the implication of log preferences for the households' within-period choices. Log preferences also have important implications for the households' intertemporal choices. As we will see in Section 9.B, the households with log preferences are "myopic" because they do not pay attention to the time variations in investment opportunities.

# 3.D Currency Risk Premia in the Long Run

So far we have been focusing on the currency risk premium and currency factor structure in one-period returns. In this section, we turn to the long-run currency risk premium and the long-term bond yields. This approach builds on works related to the permanent and the transitory components of the SDFs, such as Alvarez and Jermann [2005], Hansen and Scheinkman [2009], Backus, Boyarchenko, and Chernov [2018], Lustig, Stathopoulos, and Verdelhan [2019]. We start with some additional notations. First, we introduce the multi-period bonds. Let  $r_t(h)$  denote the log yield on the risk-free bond with maturity  $h$ . The bond price is given by

$$
p _ {t} (h) = \exp (- r _ {t} (h) h).
$$

If we allow the home and foreign households to trade this bond in the baseline economy, we can extend the household budget constraint (1.1) to

$$
p _ {t} y _ {t} + \sum_ {h} b _ {H, t - 1} (h) \exp (r _ {t - 1} (h)) + \sum_ {h} b _ {F, t - 1} (h) \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} (h) - e _ {t}) = c _ {t} + \sum_ {h} b _ {H, t} (h) + \sum_ {h} b _ {F, t} (h) \exp (- e _ {t}).
$$

Then, the Lagrangian implies the following Euler equations

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta^ {h} \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + h})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})} \exp (r _ {t} (h) h) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta^ {h} \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + h} ^ {*})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})} \exp (- \Delta e _ {t, t + h} + r _ {t} (h) h) \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\Delta e_{t,t + h} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} e_{t + h} - e_t$  denotes the  $h$ -period log exchange rate movement.

If we define the multi-horizon SDFs as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (m _ {t, t + h}) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \delta^ {h} \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + h})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})}, \\ \exp (m _ {t, t + h} ^ {*}) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \delta^ {h} \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + h} ^ {*})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})}, \\ \end{array}
$$

then, the Euler equations can be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t, t + h}) \exp (r _ {t} (h) h) ], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t, t + h} ^ {*}\right) \exp \left(- \Delta e _ {t, t + h} + r _ {t} (h) h\right) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

It is useful to compare two different multi-horizon currency trading strategies from period 0 to period  $h$ . In the first strategy, the home households buy the foreign one-period bond and sell the home one-period bond in each period  $t$ . The cumulative log return from this strategy is

$$
r x _ {h} ^ {(1)} (h) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {h} (\Delta e _ {t} + r _ {t - 1} (1) - r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} (1)) = \Delta e _ {0, h} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {h} (r _ {t - 1} (1) - r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} (1)).
$$

In the second strategy, the home households buy the foreign  $h$ -period bond and sell the home  $h$ -period bond in period 0, and hold both positions until maturity. The cumulative log return from this strategy is

$$
r x _ {h} ^ {(h)} (h) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \Delta e _ {0, h} + h \left(r _ {0} (h) - r _ {0} ^ {*} (h)\right).
$$

While both strategies are exposed to the same exchange rate risk captured by  $\Delta e_{0,h}$ , the cumulative interest rate differential between one-period bonds, i.e.,  $\sum_{t=1}^{h}(r_{t-1}(1) - r_{t-1}^*(1))$ , can be different from the interest rate differential between  $h$ -period bonds, i.e.,  $h(r_0(h) - r_0^*(h))$ . So, these two strategies generate different returns.

# 3.D.1 Economic Set-up

We begin with an economic set-up to motivate the SDF decomposition that we will consider next. We begin with a one-country endowment economy with CRRA preferences. The endowment  $y_{t}$  has a permanent component  $y_{t}^{P}$  and a transitory component  $y_{t}^{T}$ , which satisfy

$$
\log y _ {t} = \log y _ {t} ^ {P} + \log y _ {t} ^ {T},
$$

$$
\log y _ {t} ^ {P} = \log y _ {t - 1} ^ {P} + \mu + v _ {P} \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {P},
$$

$$
\log y _ {t} ^ {T} = \phi \log y _ {t - 1} ^ {T} + \nu_ {T} \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {T},
$$

where  $0 \leq \phi < 1$  and  $\varepsilon_t^P$  and  $\varepsilon_t^T$  are serially independent and normally distributed random variables with mean zero and standard deviation of one.

The representative households' preference is

$$
u (c _ {t}) = \delta^ {t} \frac {c _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma}.
$$

With market clearing  $y_{t} = c_{t}$ , the log marginal utility can be written as

$$
m c _ {t} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \log u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) = t \log \delta - \gamma \log y _ {t},
$$

which we decompose into a permanent component  $mc_{t}^{P}$  and a transitory component  $mc_{t}^{T}$ :

$$
m c _ {t} = m c _ {t} ^ {P} + m c _ {t} ^ {T},
$$

where

$$
m c _ {t} ^ {P} = - \frac {\overline {{m c}} ^ {T}}{1 - \phi} + \frac {\phi}{1 - \phi} \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi} + \left(\log \delta - \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi}\right) t - \gamma \log y _ {t} ^ {P},
$$

$$
m c _ {t} ^ {T} = \frac {\overline {{m c}} ^ {T}}{1 - \phi} - \frac {\phi}{1 - \phi} \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi} + \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi} t - \gamma \log y _ {t} ^ {T},
$$

where the constant  $\beta$  and  $\overline{mc}^T$  satisfies

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi} = \frac {1}{2} (\gamma \nu_ {P}) ^ {2} + \log \delta - \mu \gamma , \\ \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} = - \frac {1}{2 + 2 \phi} \gamma^ {2} \nu_ {T} ^ {2} - \gamma^ {2} \nu_ {P} \nu_ {T} \rho_ {T P} + \frac {\phi}{1 - \phi} \log \beta . \\ \end{array}
$$

The permanent component  $mc_{t}^{P}$  contains the shock  $\varepsilon_{t}^{P}$  to the permanent component of the endowment, whereas the transitory component  $mc_{t}^{T}$  contains the shock  $\varepsilon_{t}^{T}$  to the transitory component of the endowment. The two marginal utility components also contain additional constants and time trends, such that the permanent component

of the marginal utility, i.e.,  $\exp (mc_t^P)$ , is a Martingale:

$$
m c _ {t} ^ {P} = m c _ {t - 1} ^ {P} - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {P} \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {P}, \tag {3.14}
$$

$$
m c _ {t} ^ {T} = \bar {m c} ^ {T} + \phi m c _ {t - 1} ^ {T} + t \log \beta + \sigma_ {T} \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {T}, \tag {3.15}
$$

where

$$
\sigma_ {P} = - \gamma \nu_ {P},
$$

$$
\sigma_ {T} = - \gamma v _ {T}.
$$

In this way, our simple endowment economy motivates a decomposition of the marginal utility into the permanent and transitory components, which we study further in the next subsection.

# 3.D.2 SDF Decomposition

Alvarez and Jermann [2005] propose a general decomposition of the marginal utility:

$$
m c _ {t} = m c _ {t} ^ {T} + m c _ {t} ^ {P},
$$

where  $mc_{t}^{T}$  denotes the transitory component of the SDF,

$$
\exp \left(m c _ {t} ^ {T}\right) = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \frac {\tilde {\delta} ^ {t + h}}{p _ {t} (h)}, \tag {3.16}
$$

where the constant  $\tilde{\delta}$  is chosen to satisfy the regularity condition  $0 < \lim_{h\to \infty}p_t(h) / \tilde{\delta}^h < \infty$ . The transitory component is closely related to the return to the infinite-horizon bond:

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \frac {p _ {t + 1} (h - 1)}{p _ {t} (h)} = \exp \left(m c _ {t} ^ {T} - m c _ {t + 1} ^ {T}\right). \tag {3.17}
$$

The permanent component of the marginal utility is a martingale by construction:

$$
\exp \left(m c _ {t} ^ {P}\right) = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \frac {p _ {t} (h)}{\tilde {\delta} ^ {t + h}} \exp \left(m c _ {t}\right) = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \frac {\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m c _ {t + h}\right)\right]}{\tilde {\delta} ^ {t + h}},
$$

where we used  $p_t(h) = \mathbb{E}_t[\exp (m_{t,t + h})] = \mathbb{E}_t[\exp (mc_{t + h} - mc_t)]$ .

The marginal utility components  $mc_{t}^{T}$  and  $mc_{t}^{P}$  we considered in Eq. (3.14) and (3.15) provide a concrete example of the decomposition. Let us use  $\rho_{TP}$  to denote the correlation between the permanent shock  $\varepsilon_{t}^{P}$  and the transitory shock  $\varepsilon_{t}^{T}$ . Let  $\sigma_{TP} = \sigma_{T}\sigma_{P}\rho_{TP}$ .

In this economy, the bond price satisfies

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t, t + h}) p _ {t} (h) ].
$$

Evaluating this conditional expectation and take the horizon  $h$  to infinity, we obtain the following proposition about the long-term yield.

Proposition 3.9. (a) The long term bond price is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} p _ {t} (h) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \exp (- r _ {t} (h) h) = \exp \left(\frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + \left(\frac {t + h - \phi^ {h} (t + 1)}{1 - \phi} - \frac {\phi - \phi^ {h}}{(1 - \phi) ^ {2}}\right) \log \beta + (\phi^ {h} - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} \right. \\ \left. + \frac {1 - \phi^ {2 h}}{2 - 2 \phi^ {2}} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \sigma_ {T P}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

(b) Let  $\tilde{\delta} \stackrel{def}{=} \beta^{1/(1-\phi)}$ . Then, the long-term bond yield satisfies

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} r _ {t} (h) + \log \tilde {\delta} = 0, \tag {3.18}
$$

and

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \left(r _ {t} (h) + \log \tilde {\delta}\right) h = \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\infty} \phi^ {i} \sigma_ {T} \varepsilon_ {t - i} ^ {T} - \frac {1}{2 - 2 \phi^ {2}} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{1 - \phi} \sigma_ {T P}. \tag {3.19}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.11. This result offers several insights for thinking about the valuation of the long-term bond. Part (a) of the proposition shows that the variations in the bond yield  $r_t(h)$  only depend on the variations in the transitory SDF component  $mc_t^T$ , both when  $h$  is finite and when we take  $h$  to infinity. This is because movements in the transitory SDF component will mean-revert in the future, which contains information about the future SDF movement  $m_{t,t + h}$  and therefore affects the bond yield. In comparison, the permanent SDF component does not affect the bond yield, because they permanently shift the marginal utility level  $mc_t$ , and contain no information about the future SDF movement  $m_{t,t + h}$  by construction.

While the permanent SDF component does not affect the bond yield, it manifests itself in the exchange rate. When markets are complete, the exchange rate (in log) is equal to the log SDF differential. As a result, a shock to the permanent component of a country's SDF will have a permanent impact on the bilateral exchange rate unless it is offset by a shock to the permanent component of the other country's SDF.

In part (b) of the proposition, Eq. (3.18) shows that the long-term bond yield  $r_t(h)$  converges to

$$
- \log \tilde {\delta} = - \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi} = - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} - \log \delta + \mu \gamma
$$

as the horizon  $h$  approaches infinity. This value depends on the volatility of the permanent SDF shock,  $\sigma_{P}$ , but it does not depend on the volatility of the transitory SDF shock,  $\sigma_{T}$ , or the realization of the transitory SDF shocks,  $\varepsilon_{t}^{T}$ . In particular, this value is equal to the one-period yield in the absence of the transitory endowment shocks. So, while the permanent SDF component does not affect the variations in the bond yield, it affects its unconditional level.

Eq. (3.19) shows that the long-term bond price, after taking out the deterministic trend  $(\log \tilde{\delta})h$ , converges to a function of the past transitory shocks  $\varepsilon_{t - i}^{T}$ . This quantity is closely related to the exchange rate level, as we will see next. Moreover, using the definition of the bond price  $p_t(h)\stackrel {\mathrm{def}}{=}\exp (-r_t(h)h)$ , we can show that the bond price scaled by  $\tilde{\delta}$  is finite:

$$
0 <   \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} p _ {t} (h) / \tilde {\delta} ^ {h} <   \infty .
$$

Before we move on to the two-country setting, let us consider two special cases. The first special case is one in which the transitory endowment shock  $\varepsilon_t^T$  is always zero. In this case, the SDF is a martingale, and the bond yields are constant across time and across tenors:

$$
r _ {t} (h) = - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} - \log \delta + \mu \gamma .
$$

The second special case is one in which the permanent endowment shock  $\varepsilon_t^P$  is always zero. In this case, according to Eq. (3.17), reproduced below,

$$
\lim _ {h \to \infty} \frac {p _ {t + 1} (h - 1)}{p _ {t} (h)} = \exp \left(m c _ {t} ^ {T} - m c _ {t + 1} ^ {T}\right),
$$

the return to the infinite-horizon bond is exposed to the shock to the transitory component of marginal utility, which contains all the SDF risk there is. As a result, the infinite-horizon bond is the riskiest asset in this economy, and should therefore earn the highest Sharpe ratio. If the 30-year bond is a good proxy for the infinite-horizon bond, its low return in the data suggests that this special case is not a good description of the world.

# 3.D.3 Two Countries

Now, we consider the pair of SDFs between the home and the foreign countries. We also decompose the foreign marginal utility as

$$
m c _ {t} ^ {*} = m c _ {t} ^ {T, *} + m c _ {t} ^ {P, *}.
$$

When markets are complete, the exchange rate is equal to the ratio of the two countries' SDFs:

$$
\Delta e _ {t} = \Delta m c _ {t} - \Delta m c _ {t} ^ {*} = (\Delta m c _ {t} ^ {P} - \Delta m c _ {t} ^ {P, *}) + (\Delta m c _ {t} ^ {T} - \Delta m c _ {t} ^ {T, *}).
$$

For notational convenience, we define

$$
\Delta e _ {t} ^ {P} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \Delta m c _ {t} ^ {P} - \Delta m c _ {t} ^ {P, *},
$$

$$
\Delta e _ {t} ^ {T} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \Delta m c _ {t} ^ {T} - \Delta m c _ {t} ^ {T, *}.
$$

From the definition of the transitory SDF component in Eq. (3.16), the transitory component of the exchange rate movement is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta e _ {t} ^ {T} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \Delta m c _ {t} ^ {T} - \Delta m c _ {t} ^ {T, *} \\ = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \Delta \log \frac {\tilde {\delta} ^ {t + h}}{p _ {t} (h)} - \Delta \log \frac {\left(\tilde {\delta} ^ {*}\right) ^ {t + h}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} (h)} = \log \tilde {\delta} - \log \tilde {\delta} ^ {*} + \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} h \left(\Delta r _ {t} (h) - \Delta r _ {t} ^ {*} (h)\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

If two countries share the same martingale component of the pricing kernel, then the resulting exchange rate is stationary up to a deterministic time trend. In this case,

$$
\Delta e _ {t} = \Delta e _ {t} ^ {T} = \log \tilde {\delta} - \log \tilde {\delta} ^ {*} + \lim _ {h \to \infty} h (\Delta r _ {t} (h) - \Delta r _ {t} ^ {*} (h)).
$$

For the exchange rate movement to be finite,  $\lim_{h\to \infty}h(\Delta r_t(h) - \Delta r_t^* (h))$  must be finite, which means that a stationary exchange rate in a complete-market economy requires the home and foreign long-term bond yields to be identical in the limit:

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \left(\Delta r _ {t} (h) - \Delta r _ {t} ^ {*} (h)\right) = 0. \tag {3.20}
$$

Finally, assuming  $\log \tilde{\delta} = \log \tilde{\delta}^*$  and iterating this equation forward, we obtain the following result [Lustig, Stathopoulos, and Verdelhan, 2019].

Proposition 3.10. When markets are complete and the two countries' SDFs share the same permanent component, the deviation of the current exchange rate level  $e_t$  from its long-run mean  $\bar{e} = \lim_{j \to \infty} \mathbb{E}_t[e_{t+j}]$  is purely driven by the infinite-horizon bond yield differential:

$$
e _ {t} - \bar {e} = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} h \left(r _ {t} (h) - r _ {t} ^ {*} (h)\right). \tag {3.21}
$$

We can think of Eq. (3.21) as the long-run uncovered interest rate parity (long-run UIP) condition. This condition is related to the one-period UIP condition:

$$
e _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ e _ {t + 1} ] = r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

In Section 1.B Eq. (1.13), we show that the one-period UIP condition fails, and an additional risk premium term  $rp_{t}$  is required on the right-hand side. In comparison, Eq. (3.21) shows that, when the exchange rate is stationary, the uncertainty in the exchange rate level over the infinite horizon vanishes from the pricing perspective, leading to zero risk premium. As a result, the exchange rate's deviation from the long-run mean is only determined by the long-term bond yield differential.

Moreover, if we compare this result with the exchange rate accounting formula in Proposition 1.2, reproduced below,

$$
e _ {t} - \bar {e} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} ] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r p _ {t + j} ],
$$

we can see that the infinite-horizon bond yield incorporates information about both the future short rates and the future currency risk premia, i.e.,

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} h \left(r _ {t} (h) - r _ {t} ^ {*} (h)\right) = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} \right] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r p _ {t + j} \right].
$$

If we further decompose the infinite-horizon bond yield into an expected short rate component and a yield spread component, the bond yield spread differential is related to the currency risk premium:

$$
\lim _ {h \to \infty} \left(h r _ {t} (h) - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {h - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + j} ]\right) - \lim _ {h \to \infty} \left(h r _ {t} ^ {*} (h) - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {h - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + j} ^ {*} ]\right) = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r p _ {t + j} ].
$$

In this equation, the left-hand side is the cumulative excess return of holding the home bond until maturity minus that of holding the foreign bond, and the right-hand side is the currency risk premium derived from rolling over one-period bond positions across countries. This equation shows that these two risk premium measures in the bond market and in the currency market are closely related, provided that markets are complete and the exchange rate is stationary.

Finally, the exchange rate stationarity can be imposed implicitly by monetary policies. Let us consider the following special case.

Suppose the home and foreign SDFs have the following dynamics:

$$
\begin{array}{l} m _ {t, t + 1} = - \mu - \sigma \varepsilon_ {t + 1}, \\ m _ {t, t + 1} ^ {*} = - \mu + \phi e _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

While the home SDF is a random walk (plus a deterministic drift), the foreign SDF is set up so that the foreign short rate responds to the exchange rate level. Assuming  $\phi > 0$ , the foreign central bank lowers the local one-period interest rate  $r_t^*(1) = \mu - \phi e_t$  when the home currency is strong, which creates an expected appreciation of the foreign currency.

In complete markets, the exchange rate movement is

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t, t + 1} - m _ {t, t + 1} ^ {*} = - \phi e _ {t} - \sigma \varepsilon_ {t + 1},
$$

which is a stationary AR(1) process. In other words, the foreign interest rate's response to the exchange rate level guarantees a stable exchange rate in the long run. The long-run exchange rate is

$$
\bar{e}\stackrel {\mathrm{def}}{=}\lim_{j\to \infty}\mathbb{E}_{t}[e_{t + j}] = 0.
$$

This model allows us to solve the long-term bond yields in closed form. The home country's bond yields have a flat term structure:

$$
r _ {t} (h) = \mu - \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2}.
$$

Conjecture that

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ M _ {t, t + h} ^ {*} ] = \exp (h (a _ {h} + b _ {h} e _ {t}))
$$

with the boundary condition  $a_0 = b_0 = 0$ . By iteration,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ M _ {t, t + h} ^ {*} \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (- \mu + \phi e _ {t}) \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ M _ {t + 1, t + h} ^ {*} \right] \right. \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (- \mu + \phi e _ {t}) \exp ((h - 1) (a _ {h - 1} + b _ {h - 1} e _ {t + 1})) ] \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp \left(h \left(a _ {h} + b _ {h} e _ {t}\right)\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(- \mu + \phi e _ {t} + (h - 1) a _ {h - 1} + (h - 1) b _ {h - 1} (1 - \phi) e _ {t} - (h - 1) b _ {h - 1} \sigma \varepsilon_ {t + 1} \right] \right. \\ = \exp (- \mu + (h - 1) a _ {h - 1} + \frac {1}{2} (h - 1) ^ {2} b _ {h - 1} ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} + ((h - 1) (1 - \phi) b _ {h - 1} + \phi) e _ {t}) \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies

$$
a _ {h} = - \mu + \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{2 h} \left(\frac {1 - (1 - \phi) ^ {2 h}}{2 \phi - \phi^ {2}} - \frac {2 - 2 (1 - \phi) ^ {h}}{\phi} + h\right)
$$

$$
b _ {h} = \frac {1 - (1 - \phi) ^ {h}}{h}.
$$

As  $h \to \infty$ ,  $b_h$  converges to 0, and  $a_h$  converges to  $-\mu + \sigma^2 / 2$ , which implies

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} r _ {t} ^ {*} (h) = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} (- a _ {h} + b _ {h} e _ {t}) = \mu - \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} r _ {t} (h).
$$

That is, the foreign long-term yield  $r_t^*(h)$  converges to the home long-term yield  $r_t(h)$  for large  $h$ , even when the next-period marginal utility is stochastic in the home country (i.e.,  $var_t(mc_{t+1}) = \sigma^2$ ) while it is fully predictable in the foreign country (i.e.,  $var_t(mc_{t+1}^*) = 0$ ). This result confirms our earlier result in Eq. (3.20) that a stationary exchange rate implies that the two countries' long-term bond yields converge to the same level.

# 3.D.4 Pricing Permanent Cash Flows

Let us return to the one-country setting with the SDF specification according to Eq. (3.14) and (3.15). Let  $p_t^y(h)$  denote the price of the endowment  $y_{t + h}$  in period  $t$ , which is equal to its present value:

$$
p _ {t} ^ {y} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t, t + h}) y _ {t + h} ].
$$

We choose to study the claim to endowment because its cash flow in log is cointegrated with the permanent component of the log SDF after removing a deterministic trend. Note that

$$
m c _ {t} ^ {P} = m c _ {t - 1} ^ {P} - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {P} \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {P},
$$

$$
\log y _ {t} = \log y _ {t - 1} ^ {P} + \mu + \nu_ {P} \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {P} + \log y _ {t} ^ {T};
$$

we can show that  $mc_{t}^{P} / \sigma_{P} - (\log y_{t} - \mu t) / \nu_{P}$  is a stationary process. In comparison, the cash flow of a long-term bond is not cointegrated with the permanent component of the log SDF.

The risk premia of the endowment strip and the long-term bond is defined as the expected excess return of holding the asset for one period. They are characterized by the following proposition.

Proposition 3.11. The risk premium of the  $h$ -period risk-free bond is

$$
\begin{array}{l} r x _ {t} (h) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \log \frac {p _ {t - 1} (h - 1)}{p _ {t} (h)} - r _ {t} \right] \\ = \left(\frac {1}{2} - \frac {1}{2} \phi^ {2 (h - 1)}\right) \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + (1 - \phi^ {h - 1}) \sigma_ {T P}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The risk premium of the claim to the  $h$ -period endowment claim is

$$
\begin{array}{l} r x _ {t} ^ {y} (h) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \log \frac {p _ {t + 1} ^ {y} (h - 1)}{p _ {t} ^ {y} (h)} - r _ {t} \right] \\ = \frac {2 \gamma - 1}{2 \gamma^ {2}} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \left[ \frac {1}{2} - \frac {1}{2} \phi^ {2 (h - 1)} \left(\frac {\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\right) ^ {2} \right] \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \left[ 1 - \phi^ {h - 1} \left(\frac {\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\right) ^ {2} \right] \sigma_ {T P}. \\ \end{array}
$$

As  $h\to \infty$  , these risk premia converge to

$$
\begin{array}{l} \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} r x _ {t} (h) = \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {T P}, \\ \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} r x _ {t} ^ {y} (h) = \frac {2 \gamma - 1}{2 \gamma^ {2}} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {T P}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.12. By comparing the infinite-horizon risk premia on the bond and the endowment strip, we can see that the bond risk premium does not load on the quantity of the permanent risk,  $\sigma_{P}$ , in the limit, whereas the endowment risk premium does. In most asset pricing models, the quantity of permanent risk is very large [Alvarez and Jermann, 2005] and the risk aversion parameter  $\gamma$  is above  $1/2$ , which generate a much higher discount rate on the endowment strip than on the bond. As we will see in Section 8.E, if other cash flows (such as the equity dividend or government tax) are cointegrated with the endowment and hence with the permanent component of the SDF, then, their risk premia should converge to that of the endowment strip in the limit as well.

We notice that this risk premium does not depend on the transitory component of the SDF as well as the transitory component of the cash flow. In fact, for any cash flow stream that is cointegrated with the endowment, the risk premium on its infinite-horizon strip is also equal to  $\lim_{h\to \infty}rx_t^y (h)$ . Similarly, for any cash flow stream that is stationary, the risk premium on its infinite-horizon strip is equal to that of the infinite-horizon bond. We will use this result when considering the government's fiscal cash flows in Chapter 8.

# Convenience Yields

# Summary

- We deviate from the complete-market benchmark and introduce the bond convenience yield  $\lambda_{t}^{*}$  as a wedge in the households' Euler equations for holding the home bond:

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) \right].
$$

- This wedge affects both the currency expected return:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} \right] = r p _ {t} - \lambda_ {t} ^ {*},
$$

and the exchange rate level:

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} ] + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \lambda_ {t + j} ^ {*} ] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r p _ {t + j} ] + \bar {e}.
$$

- Under additional assumptions about the liquidity benefits of the currency forward, the convenient yield can be measured from the Treasury CIP deviation  $x_{t}^{Treas}$ :

$$
\lambda_ {t} ^ {*} = - \frac {1}{1 - \beta^ {*}} x _ {t} ^ {T r e a s}.
$$

In this chapter, we consider an additional ingredient that drives currency returns: the bond convenience yields, which reflect the currencies' non-pecuniary qualities including liquidity, safety, and the ability to pledge as collateral.

This ingredient is motivated by the near-arbitrage spreads observed in the data, which show that certain currencies and assets earn different returns despite having similar payoffs. For example, a large literature has found that the yields on U.S. Treasury debt are traded below other benchmark interest rates [Longstaff, 2004, Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2012, Nagel, 2016, Van Binsbergen, Diamond, and Grotteria, 2022]. The U.S. Treasury also appears

more expensive than TIPS [Fleckenstein, Longstaff, and Lustig, 2014], corporate bonds [Bai and Collin-Dufresne, 2019], foreign sovereign bonds [Du, Im, and Schreger, 2018a, Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig, 2018, 2021a, Koijen and Yogo, 2020], and duration-matched stocks [Van Binsbergen, 2020]. We refer to the lower yield earned by the U.S. Treasury as the convenience yield. Moreover, the convenience yield is not specific to the U.S. Treasury, as other safe assets such as high-grade dollar corporate bonds and bank deposits also appear to earn lower yields [Liao, 2020, Gutierrez, Ivashina, and Salomao, 2021].

To model these convenience yields, let  $r_t$  denote the log Treasury yield in the home country, and let  $\rho_t$  denote the log yield of a benchmark risk-free bond that does not contain any non-pecuniary benefits. Both rates are one-period. The benchmark risk-free rate exactly satisfies the households' Euler equation:

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + \rho_ {t}\right) \right].
$$

As the Treasury is more expensive, the Treasury yield is lower than the benchmark risk-free rate:

$$
r _ {t} <   \rho_ {t},
$$

which implies that the Euler equation fails for the Treasury yield:

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + \rho_ {t}) \right] > \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) \right].
$$

In other words, the Treasury yield gives rise to a wedge in the Euler equation. To capture this wedge, it is useful to conceptualize a convenience yield  $\lambda_t > 0$ , such that

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) ]. \tag {4.1}
$$

This convenience yield describes the amount of risk-adjusted expected return that the households are willing to give up in order to hold the Treasury debt. This equation will be central to organize our discussion in this chapter.

What drives this convenience yield or, equivalently, the households' willingness to give up some pecuniary return to hold the convenience asset? In the next section, we consider a setting in which this convenience yield arises because the households derive utility directly from holding the Treasury debt. While this modeling device is still too stylized to shed light on the underlying mechanism, it provides a useful starting point and illustrates some relevant properties of the convenience yield. We discuss more elaborate microfoundations proposed in the literature in Section 4.E.

Before we proceed to set up the model, we note that the convenience yield is conceptually distinct from a risk premium, because

a risk premium does not generate a wedge in the Euler equation. Consider, for example, a risky return  $\tilde{r}_{t+1}$  that does not carry a convenience yield. While this asset can earn an expected return that reflects its cyclical properties, it must satisfy the standard Euler equation,

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \big (m _ {t + 1} + \tilde {r} _ {t + 1} \big) \right].
$$

All models we considered in Chapter 3 fall into this category, although they differ in the specification of the SDF  $m_{t+1}$  that determines the risk premium.

In contrast, a special asset that carries a convenience yield generates a wedge in the Euler equation as in Eq. (4.1). In our analysis below, we will show that the convenience yield and the currency risk premium will drive variations in the exchange rate level and the currency expected return through different channels.

# 4.A An Illustrative Model

We assume that home bond generates non-pecuniary utilities when it is held by either home or foreign households. As a concrete example, we think about the home country as the U.S., the home risk-free bond as the U.S. Treasury, and the home currency as the dollar in this model.

Specifically, recall that  $b_{H,t}$  is the market value of the bond and  $r_t$  is the risk-free rate. The home investors' utility is derived over consumption and the market value of home bond holdings:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (u (c _ {t}) + v (b _ {H, t}; \theta_ {t})) \right],
$$

where  $\theta_{t}$  captures a time-varying demand shifter for U.S. bonds. We assume that the utility is increasing in the consumption and the holding in the U.S. bonds, i.e.  $u'(c_t) > 0$  and  $v'(b_{H,t};\theta_t) > 0$ . In this way, the U.S. risk-free bond carries a convenience yield, which captures its non-pecuniary benefits to U.S. and foreign investors. We assume that the marginal utility for holding U.S. bonds is decreasing in quantity, i.e.,  $v''(b) < 0$ , so that the convenience yield is decreasing in the quantity held.

# 4.A.1 Issuer of the Safe Asset

We assume that households face the same endowment processes and the same financial markets as in Section 1.A. The only difference is the presence of a government in each country, which plays the role of the safe asset issuer. Specifically, we assume that the home country's

government borrows a one-period risk-free bond with par value  $\bar{b}_t$  in period  $t$ , and pays it back in period  $t + 1$ . The government pays the proceeds from the bond issuance as a transfer to the domestic households in period  $t$ , and raises tax from the domestic households to pay off the debt in period  $t + 1$ . The household budget in period  $t$  is

$$
p _ {t} y _ {t} + b _ {H, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1}) + b _ {F, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - e _ {t}) + \bar {b} _ {t} = c _ {t} + b _ {H, t} + b _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}) + \bar {b} _ {t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1}),
$$

where  $\bar{b}_t$  on the left-hand side is the proceeds from the home government's debt issuance in period  $t$ , which is transferred to the home households, and  $\bar{b}_{t-1} \exp(r_{t-1})$  on the right-hand side is the home government's debt repayment for its borrowing in period  $t-1$ , which is financed by a tax on the home households.

In this way, we set up a simple structure that generates a positive supply of risk-free debt that home and foreign households can hold. This setting implicitly assumes the government is a natural manufacturer of risk-free debt, a theme that we will return to in this chapter and in Chapters 7 and 8. In our setting, consider any bond utility function  $v$  that satisfies the Inada condition, such that the marginal utility of bond holding approaches infinity when the bond quantity approaches zero, e.g.,  $v(b) = \log (b)$ . Then, we can show that home and foreign households have to hold positive quantities of home risk-free bonds in equilibrium. In this case, the home government is the only provider of safe assets.

# 4.A.2 Intertemporal Solution

The Lagrangian is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (u (c _ {t}) + v (b _ {H, t}; \theta_ {t})) \right. \\ \left. + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {t} (p _ {t} y _ {t} + \bar {b} _ {t} + b _ {H, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1}) + b _ {F, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - e _ {t}) - c _ {t} - \bar {b} _ {t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1}) - b _ {H, t} - b _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t})) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

The first-order conditions w.r.t.  $c_{t}, b_{H,t}$  and  $b_{F,t}$  are

$$
\delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) - \zeta_ {t} = 0,
$$

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta^ {t} v ^ {\prime} \left(b _ {H, t}; \theta_ {t}\right) - \zeta_ {t} + \zeta_ {t + 1} \exp (r _ {t}) \right] = 0,
$$

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ - \zeta_ {t} \exp (- e _ {t}) + \zeta_ {t + 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - e _ {t + 1}\right) \right] = 0.
$$

The implied Euler equations for home households are

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t + 1}\right)}{u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)} \exp \left(r _ {t}\right) + \frac {v ^ {\prime} \left(b _ {H , t} ; \theta_ {t}\right)}{u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)} \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t + 1}\right)}{u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)} \exp \left(- \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

If we define the home households' convenience yield as

$$
\exp \left(- \lambda_ {t}\right) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} 1 - \frac {v ^ {\prime} \left(b _ {H , t} ; \theta_ {t}\right)}{u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)}, \tag {4.2}
$$

which is determined by the ratio between the marginal utility of bond holding and the marginal utility of consumption. This equilibrium convenience yield  $\lambda_{t}$  is driven by both demand shocks captured by  $\theta_{t}$  and supply shocks which affect the equilibrium bond holdings  $b_{H,t}$ .

Then, we can express the Euler equations as

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) ],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right].
$$

In doing so, we offer a more structural interpretation for the convenience yields that we defined in Eq. (4.1).

Similarly, we modify the foreign utility as

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (u ^ {*} (c _ {t}) + v (b _ {H, t} ^ {*}; \theta_ {t} ^ {*})) \right],
$$

where the market value  $b_{H,t}^{*}$  of foreign households' bond holding is also in the home (real) currency units. We define the foreign households' convenience yield as

$$
\exp \left(- \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}\right) = 1 - \frac {v ^ {\prime} \left(b _ {H , t} ^ {*} ; \theta_ {t} ^ {*}\right) \exp \left(- e _ {t}\right)}{u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right)}. \tag {4.3}
$$

Then, the foreign households' Euler equations are

$$
\exp \left(- \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} + \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} ^ {*}) \right].
$$

# 4.A.3 Market Clearing

In goods market, the endowment is equal to the sum of consumption:

$$
y _ {t} = c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
y _ {t} ^ {*} = c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*}.
$$

In bonds market, the home and foreign bonds are in positive supply that is provided by their governments:

$$
b _ {t} = b _ {H, t} + b _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
b _ {t} ^ {*} = b _ {F, t} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*}.
$$

# 4.A.4 Macro Synthesis

The exogenous variables now include the endowments and the safe-asset demand shifters:

$$
\left(y _ {t}, y _ {t} ^ {*}, \bar {b} _ {t}, \bar {b} _ {t} ^ {*}, \theta_ {t}, \theta_ {t} ^ {*}\right) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}
$$

There are 13 endogenous variables in each period  $t$ :

$$
(c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}, b _ {H, t}, b _ {F, t}, p _ {t}, c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}, b _ {H, t} ^ {*}, b _ {F, t} ^ {*}, p _ {t} ^ {*}, r _ {t}, r _ {t} ^ {*}, e _ {t}) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}.
$$

Let  $\exp(m_{t+1}) = \delta \frac{u'(c_{t+1})}{u'(c_t)}$  and  $\exp(m_{t+1}^*) = \delta \frac{u'(c_{t+1}^*)}{u'(c_t^*)}$  denote the home and foreign SDFs. Let

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = 1 - \frac {v ^ {\prime} (b _ {H , t} ; \theta_ {t})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})},
$$

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}) = 1 - \frac {v ^ {\prime} (b _ {H , t} ^ {*} ; \theta_ {t} ^ {*}) \exp (- e _ {t})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})},
$$

denote the convenience yields that home and foreign households impute to the home bond.

The model implies the following 14 equations in each period, one of which is redundant since the market clearing adds up to the sum of households' budget constraints. For the Home country in period  $t$ ,

$$
p _ {t} y _ {t} + \bar {b} _ {t} + b _ {H, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t}) + b _ {F, t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - e _ {t}) = (c _ {H, t}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {F, t}) ^ {1 - \alpha} + \bar {b} _ {t - 1} \exp (r _ {t - 1}) + b _ {H, t} + b _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}),
$$

$$
\left(c _ {H, t}\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(c _ {F, t}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} = p _ {t} c _ {H, t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} \exp \left(- e _ {t}\right),
$$

$$
y _ {t} = c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t ^ {\prime}} ^ {*}
$$

$$
\bar {b} _ {t} = b _ {H, t} + b _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1}) \exp (r _ {t}) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1}\right) \exp \left(- \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right],
$$

For the Foreign country in period  $t$ ,

$$
p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} + \bar {b} _ {t} ^ {*} + \exp (r _ {t - 1} + e _ {t}) b _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} + b _ {F, t - 1} ^ {*} \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}) = (c _ {F, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {H, t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \alpha} + \bar {b} _ {t - 1} ^ {*} \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}) + \exp (e _ {t}) b _ {H, t} ^ {*} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
\left(c _ {F, t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(c _ {H, t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} = p _ {t} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} \exp \left(e _ {t}\right) + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
y _ {t} ^ {*} = c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
\bar {b} _ {t} ^ {*} = b _ {F, t} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right],
$$

$$
\exp \left(- \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \exp \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right].
$$

The within-period problem is the same as in the benchmark model. The prices and exchange rates can be pinned down by:

$$
\frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})} = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}.
$$

Compared to the macro synthesis in the baseline model in Section 1.A, the main difference is that the convenience yields are introduced in the home and foreign households' Euler equations for the home bond. We also make an auxiliary assumption that the bonds are in positive net supply, so that the utilities that the home and foreign households derive from holding the home bond are well-behaved.

# 4.B Exchange Rate Accounting

Next, we repeat the exchange rate accounting exercise in this model with bond convenience yields. The derivation is taken from Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig [2021a], Jiang, Krishnamurthy, Lustig, and Sun [2021b]. The model with bond convenience yields shows that the four Euler equations for bond holdings now contain additional convenience yield terms:

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right], \tag {4.4}
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \tag {4.5}
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \tag {4.6}
$$

$$
\exp \left(- \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right]. \tag {4.7}
$$

We can also express these Euler equations (4.4)-(4.7) as

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + \left(r _ {t} + \lambda_ {t}\right)\right) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} ^ {*}) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \big (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + \big (r _ {t} + \lambda_ {t} ^ {*} \big) \big) \right],
$$

which look like the original Euler equations (1.6)-(1.9) that we derived in Section 1.B for risk-free bonds without convenience yields. However, a key difference makes these two cases not observationally equivalent: the home and foreign investors may have different convenience yields  $\lambda_{t}$  and  $\lambda_t^*$ . In this case, the home investors effectively perceive a home risk-free rate without convenience yield equal to  $\rho_{t} = r_{t} + \lambda_{t}$ , whereas the foreign investors effectively perceive a different home risk-free rate without convenience yield equal to  $\tilde{\rho}_{t} = r_{t} + \lambda_{t}^{*}$ . Therefore, we cannot map the setting with bond convenience yields back to the baseline model without bond convenience yields by modifying the bond yields.

# 4.B.1 Equilibrium Forces

Let us first work through a thought experiment that helps elucidate the restrictions these Euler equations impose on equilibrium exchange rates.

Suppose that at time  $t$ , there is an exogenous increase in  $\lambda_t^*$ , i.e., the foreign households' convenience yield on the home safe assets. For the sake of this argument, we will assume the home and foreign SDFs and the home households' convenience yield remain unaffected. Then, this increase in foreign households' convenience yield sets off the following chain of events.

First, consider the home households' Euler equation for holding domestic bonds, Eq. (4.4), reproduced below,

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) \right].
$$

Since the home households' SDF and convenience yield are assumed to be unaffected, this Euler equation implies that the dollar risk-free rate  $r_t$  does not change.

Second, from the foreign households' Euler equation for holding home bonds, Eq. (4.7), reproduced below,

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} + \Delta e _ {t + 1}) \right],
$$

an increase in their convenience yield  $\lambda_t^*$  lowers their risk-neutral expected return on holding home risk-free bonds. Since the dollar risk-free rate does not change, the exchange rate has to adjust to equilibrate this Euler equation. In particular, the dollar needs to appreciate today and create an expected depreciation to generate the lower expected return.

Lastly, if we examine the home households' Euler equation for holding foreign bonds, Eq. (4.5), reproduced below,

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \big (m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*} - \Delta e _ {t + 1}) \right],
$$

we learn that the dollar exchange rate movement also raises the expected return on purchasing foreign currency bonds from the home perspective. Since the home households do not derive a convenience yield on foreign bonds that can adjust, all adjustment must happen in the dollar's currency risk premium. In our equilibrium, this happens via endogenous changes in the cyclicality and volatility of the dollar. Thus, these four Euler equations require endogenous responses in both first moments (i.e., exchange rate level and expected return) as well as second moments (i.e., currency cyclicality and volatility) in response to the shock to the convenience yield. As such, although the convenience yield and the risk premium are conceptually different, they could be correlated in practice.

# 4.B.2 Accounting for the Currency Expected Return

For the discussion in this section, we assume the random variables are jointly normally distributed. First, we can derive the home inter

est rate expression:

$$
r _ {t} = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) - \lambda_ {t},
$$

which now contains the convenience yield term  $\lambda_{t}$ . When the home households' convenience yield is higher, the home bonds' interest rate is lower.

Next, the foreign households' Euler equations can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) + r _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ - \lambda_ {t} ^ {*} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) + \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}) + c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}) + r _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Recall that the expected log excess return of the home currency against the foreign currency is defined as

$$
r x _ {t + 1} = \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

Then, the Euler equations imply the following result:

Proposition 4.1. The home currency's expected log excess return is determined jointly by the home currency's risk premium and the home bond's convenience yield:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} \right] = r p _ {t} - \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}, \tag {4.8}
$$

where  $r p_{t} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} -\text{cov}_{t}(m_{t+1}^{*}, \Delta e_{t+1}) - \frac{1}{2}\text{var}_{t}(\Delta e_{t+1})$  is the currency risk premium.

If we compare this result to the benchmark case in Proposition 1.10, we note that the currency expected excess return now depends on both the currency risk premium and the convenience yield. These two components of the currency expected excess return are conceptually different: the risk premium is the compensation for the currency's risk exposures, whereas the convenience yield reflects the non-pecuniary benefits that investors derive from holding the bonds issued in this currency. Of course, the currency risk premium and the convenience yield could be correlated, as recessions tend to increase risk premia as well as demand for safe assets. That said, they are two conceptually distinct channels that affect the currency expected return and, as we will see next, the exchange rate level.

Similarly, there is an expression from the home households' perspective:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ - r x _ {t + 1} ] = - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}, - \Delta e _ {t + 1}) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}) + \lambda_ {t}.
$$

Combined together, these expressions imply that the home and foreign investors need to agree on the combination of the equilibrium

currency risk premium and the convenience yield from their different perspectives:

$$
- c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \lambda_ {t} ^ {*} = c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, - \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) + \frac {1}{2} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \lambda_ {t}, \tag {4.9}
$$

which is a direct extension of Eq. (1.12) which does not consider convenience yields.

# 4.B.3 Accounting for the Exchange Rate Level

Moreover, assuming the real exchange rate is stationary, then, we obtain a more general decomposition of the exchange rate level that extends Proposition 1.2:

Proposition 4.2. The exchange rate level is equal to the sum of expected future interest rate differentials, the sum of expected future convenience yields, the sum of expected future currency risk premia, and the long-run exchange rate level:

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} ] + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \lambda_ {t + j} ^ {*} ] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r p _ {t + j} ] + \bar {e}.
$$

In other words, if today's home currency is stronger than its long-run mean, it is either because the home currency is offering a higher interest rate than the foreign currency, or it has a higher convenience yield, or because it has a lower risk premium (i.e., a lower discount rate).

Similar to the exchange rate accounting in Section 1.B, we can also use this formula to decompose the exchange rate innovation:

$$
(\mathbb {E} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1}) [ e _ {t} ] = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} (\mathbb {E} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1}) [ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} ] + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} (\mathbb {E} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1}) [ \lambda_ {t + j} ^ {*} ] - (\mathbb {E} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1}) \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r p _ {t + j} ],
$$

which likewise contains a convenience yield component.

Moreover, consider the risk-free rates  $\rho_{t}$  and  $\rho_{t}^{*}$  without convenience yields, which satisfy the standard Euler equations:

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + \rho_ {t}) ],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \rho_ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right].
$$

We can relate these two risk-free rates to the bond yields  $r_t$  and  $r_t^*$  by

$$
\rho_ {t} = r _ {t} + \lambda_ {t},
$$

$$
\rho_ {t} ^ {*} = r _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

As the home bond carries a convenience yield, the home households' Euler equation implies that it is lower than the home risk-free rate

$\rho_{t}$  by exactly  $\lambda_{t}$ . In comparison, the foreign bond does not carry a convenience yield, so the foreign bond yield  $r_t^*$  is equal to the foreign risk-free rate  $\rho_t^*$ .

Then, we can reorganize the terms in Proposition 4.2 and show

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \rho_ {t + j} - \rho_ {t + j} ^ {*} ] + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \lambda_ {t + j} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {t + j} ] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r p _ {t + j} ] + \bar {e},
$$

which implies that the variations in the exchange rate level are driven by the variations in the risk-free rate differentials (which carry no convenience yields), in the currency risk premia, and in the difference between the convenience yields that home and foreign households derive from holding the home bond.

This expression shows why it is natural to focus on the case in which home and foreign households derive different convenience yields, i.e.,  $\lambda_t \neq \lambda_t^*$ . If the home and foreign households have the identical convenience yield, i.e.,  $\lambda_t = \lambda_t^*$ , then, the exchange rate level is determined only by the risk-free rate differentials and the currency risk premia, both of which are driven by the SDFs via

$$
\begin{array}{l} \rho_ {t} - \rho_ {t} ^ {*} = - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1}\right) \right] + \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \right], \\ r p _ {t} = - c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

In other words, only the home and foreign households' convenience yield differential, rather than their convenience yield levels, matters for the exchange rate level.

# 4.B.4 Comparison with the Complete-Market Case

Building on the discussion of the exchange rate determination, let us consider complete markets as a special case. In the model we specified in Section 4.A, we additionally assume that the home and foreign households can trade the complete set of contingent claims. In the meanwhile, these households still derive non-pecuniary benefits from holding the dollar risk-free bond, so the model is still different from the baseline model in Section 1.C.

In this case, we can solve the model by assuming a social planner who maximizes the sum of home and foreign utilities with weights  $\pi$  and  $1 - \pi$ , subject to the market clearing conditions for goods and bonds. The equilibrium convenience yields satisfy the following relationships [Jiang, 2023a].

Proposition 4.3. When the markets are complete, the home and foreign households derive the same convenience yields from holding the dollar bond:

$$
\lambda_ {t} = \lambda_ {t} ^ {*},
$$

and the exchange rate is determined only by the marginal utility differential:

$$
\Delta e _ {t} ^ {c m} = m _ {t} - m _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.13. This proposition shows that, while the convenience yields can be nonzero in complete markets, they do not directly affect the equilibrium exchange rate. $^{1}$  More precisely, the convenience yields  $\lambda_{t}$  and  $\lambda_{t}^{*}$  are equalized to generate zero differential. Given the definitions of these convenience yields in Eq. (4.2) and (4.3), this means that the home and foreign households' marginal utilities derived from holding the dollar bond are equalized (after multiplication with the Pareto weights  $\pi$  and  $1 - \pi$ ):

$$
\pi v ^ {\prime} (b _ {H, t}; \theta_ {t}) = (1 - \pi) v ^ {\prime} (b _ {H, t} ^ {*}; \theta_ {t} ^ {*}),
$$

which is similar to the equilibrium condition under complete markets that the home and foreign households' marginal utilities over consumption are also equalized (after unit conversion by the exchange rate  $\exp(e_t)$  and multiplication with the Pareto weights  $\pi$  and  $1 - \pi$ ):

$$
\pi u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) = (1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \exp \left(e _ {t}\right).
$$

As such, incomplete markets are an essential ingredient to make the convenience yields matter for exchange rates. We will further explore the interaction between incomplete markets and convenience yields in Section 5.D.

# 4.B.5 The Yield-Exchange Rate Connection

The introduction of the convenience yield also broadens how we think about the relationship between the interest rate in a country and its currency strength. Under the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition, a higher interest rate is associated with a stronger currency. We can see this from Proposition 4.2, which predicts a positive relationship between the currency value  $e_t$  of the home country and its interest rate  $r_t$ , holding other things constant:

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} ] + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \lambda_ {t + j} ^ {*} ] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r p _ {t + j} ] + \bar {e}.
$$

However, when we introduce the convenience yield, the relationship between the interest rate and the currency value becomes more complicated. By the home households' Euler equation, the home interest rate level is determined by the home households' SDF and convenience yield:

$$
r _ {t} = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) - \lambda_ {t}.
$$

In the complete-market world, convenience yields may still affect exchange rates indirectly via their effect on relative marginal utilities, for example, by affecting the natural rate in the home country [Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas, 2021, Kekre and Lenel, 2021].

Holding other things constant, a higher convenience yield  $\lambda_{t}$  lowers the home interest rate  $r_t$ . During global recessions, it is plausible that the flight to safety raises the convenience yields that both home and foreign households impute to the U.S. bond, i.e.,  $\lambda_{t}$  and  $\lambda_{t}^{*}$ . Then, the home interest rate  $r_t$  decreases, while the convenience yield component strengthens the home currency, leading to a negative relationship between the home interest rate and the home currency value.

This discussion shows that the yield-exchange rate relationship depends on the types of shocks we are considering [Jiang, Krishnamurthy, Lustig, and Sun, 2021b]. When we consider a monetary shock  $\varepsilon_t^m$  whose primary effect is to raise the home interest rate, we expect a positive yield-exchange rate relationship:

$$
c o v _ {t} \left(e _ {t}, r _ {t} \mid \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {m}\right) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} c o v _ {t} \left(p r o j \left[ e _ {t} \mid \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {m} \right], p r o j \left[ r _ {t} \mid \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {m} \right]\right) > 0.
$$

When we consider a demand shock  $\varepsilon_t^d$  whose primary effect is to raise the convenience yield, which lowers the bond yield while strengthening the currency, we expect a negative yield-exchange rate relationship:

$$
c o v _ {t} (e _ {t}, r _ {t} | \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {d}) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} c o v _ {t} (p r o j [ e _ {t} | \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {d} ], p r o j [ r _ {t} | \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {d} ]) <   0.
$$

The overall relationship between the interest rate and the exchange rate depends on the relative strength of these two effects.

This intuition also carries over to the case of long-term debt, whose yield also depends on the expected interest rates and the convenience yields. In particular, an increase in the expected path of interest rates raises the long-term bond yield and appreciates the currency, whereas a flight-to-safety shock can lower the long-term bond yield if it also carries some convenience benefits, while appreciating the currency. However, as we see in Section 3.D, when markets are complete and exchange rates are stationary, the presence of currency risk premium does not break the long-run UIP condition (3.21). As a result, like interest rate shocks, risk premium shocks affect the long-run bond yield and the exchange rate in the same direction, which also shows a stark difference between currency risk premium and convenience yield.

# 4.C Measuring the Convenience Yields

Having described the role convenience yields play in exchange rate dynamics, we face the obvious question of how they are measured empirically. As indicated in Section 2.A.6, the convenience yields manifest themselves in many interest rate spreads. In this section, we

discuss this issue in the context of the Treasury basis, which follows Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig [2021a].

Recall that a dollar forward allows investors to lock in the dollar exchange rate at a fixed rate  $f_{t}$  in the next period. Now, consider the following trading strategy. In period  $t$ , an investor converts 1 unit of dollar to  $\exp(e_{t})$  units of the foreign currency, and purchase foreign risk-free bonds. At the same time, the investor enters a currency forward contract to lock in the dollar exchange rate at  $f_{t}$  in period  $t + 1$  for  $\exp(e_{t} + r_{t}^{*})$  units of foreign currency.

Then, in period  $t + 1$ , the investor has  $\exp (e_t + r_t^*)$  units of foreign currency, which are then converted back to  $\exp (-f_t + e_t + r_t^*)$  units of dollar using the forward contract. This strategy generates a return of  $\exp (-f_t + e_t + r_t^*)$  per dollar invested. Since the investor does not hold the actual dollar risk-free bond but still earns a risk-free return in dollar terms, we regard this combination of foreign risk-free bond and currency forward contract as a synthetic dollar bond.

If this synthetic dollar bond does not carry a convenience yield, then, its Euler equation can be expressed as

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t + 1} - f _ {t} + e _ {t} + r _ {t} ^ {*}) ]
$$

from the home households' perspective, and

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} - f _ {t} + e _ {t} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right]
$$

from the foreign households' perspective.

Combine with the derivation in Section 4.B. We obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} - \lambda_ {t} ^ {*} = r _ {t} - \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - f _ {t} + e _ {t}\right), \\ - \lambda_ {t} = r _ {t} - \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - f _ {t} + e _ {t}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies that the convenience yields that foreign and home households impute to the dollar risk-free bonds are equal to each other, and equal to the negative of the dollar Treasury basis, defined as

$$
x _ {t} ^ {T r e a s} \stackrel {{\mathrm {d e f}}} {{=}} r _ {t} - \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - f _ {t} + e _ {t}\right).
$$

When the dollar risk-free bond has a convenience yield, its risk-free rate  $r_t$  is lower than the synthetic dollar yield, i.e.,  $(r_t^* - f_t + e_t)$ , leading to a negative dollar Treasury basis:

$$
x _ {t} ^ {\text {T r e a s}} \stackrel {{\mathrm {d e f}}} {{=}} r _ {t} - \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - f _ {t} + e _ {t}\right) = - \lambda_ {t} ^ {*} <   0.
$$

We obtain a more realistic case by assuming that the synthetic dollar bond also carries a convenience yield, albeit smaller in magnitude than the actual dollar risk-free bond. More precisely, we assume that

the convenience yield derived from the synthetic dollar bond is a fraction  $\beta^{*}$  of the convenience yield derived from the actual dollar bond from foreign households' perspective:

$$
\exp \left(- \beta^ {*} \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} - f _ {t} + e _ {t} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right].
$$

If this synthetic dollar bond is representative of other non-Treasury dollar safe assets, a point we will next discuss in 4.C.1, then, conceptually we can say that for the convenience yield on the U.S. Treasury,  $\beta^{*}$  of it is about the dollar and  $1 - \beta^{*}$  of it is specifically about the U.S. Treasury. Indeed, combining with the derivation in Section 4.B, we obtain

$$
x _ {t} ^ {T r e a s} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} r _ {t} - \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - f _ {t} + e _ {t}\right) = - (1 - \beta^ {*}) \lambda_ {t} ^ {*} <   0,
$$

which states that the Treasury basis captures the fraction of the convenience yield that the U.S. Treasury earns on top of the synthetic dollar bond.

Similarly, from the home households' perspective, we assume that the convenience yield derived from the synthetic dollar bond is a fraction  $\beta$  of the convenience yield derived from the actual dollar bond:

$$
\exp (- \beta \lambda_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - f _ {t} + e _ {t} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right],
$$

which implies

$$
- (1 - \beta) \lambda_ {t} = r _ {t} - \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - f _ {t} + e _ {t}\right) = x _ {t} ^ {\text {T r e a s}}.
$$

As such, we can express the convenience yield levels  $\lambda_t^*$  and  $\lambda_t$  as functions of the Treasury basis  $x_t^{Treas}$ :

$$
\lambda_ {t} ^ {*} = - \frac {1}{1 - \beta^ {*}} x _ {t} ^ {\text {T r e a s}},
$$

$$
\lambda_ {t} = - \frac {1}{1 - \beta} x _ {t} ^ {T r e a s}.
$$

If  $\beta \neq \beta^{*}$ , the foreign and home households' convenience yields on the dollar risk-free bond would be different.

To restore the actual convenience yield level, we need to estimate the scaling coefficients  $\beta$  and  $\beta^{*}$ . Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig [2021a] provide an estimate based on the implied exchange rate dynamics derived in Section 4.B. Assuming that currency risk premium does not respond to a convenience yield shock, they find that the  $\beta^{*}$  coefficient has to be around 0.9 to match the variations in the Treasury basis with those in the observed exchange rate movement. This parameter estimate means that  $90\%$  of the convenience yield is about the dollar, and  $10\%$  is about the U.S. Treasury. In other words,

the synthetic dollar position contains  $90\%$  of the convenience yield on the dollar risk-free bond, and the Treasury basis only measures  $1 - 0.9 = 10\%$  of the convenience yield. To recover the convenience yield level, we need to lever up the observed Treasury basis by 10 times. As the Treasury basis is on average  $-20$  basis points per annum in the sample, the implied convenience yield has to be  $2\%$  per annum on average, which is much greater than any near-arbitrage interest rate spreads.

# 4.C.1 Treasury CIP vs. Libor CIP

This argument also helps us understand the Libor basis, which is the spread between the dollar Libor rate and the synthetic dollar rate based on the foreign Libor rate and the currency forward:

$$
x _ {t} ^ {\text {L i b o r}} \stackrel {{\text {d e f}}} {{=}} \operatorname {l i b o r} _ {t} - \left(\operatorname {l i b o r} _ {t} ^ {*} - f _ {t} + e _ {t}\right).
$$

Unlike the Treasury basis, the Libor basis was very close to zero before the Global Financial Crisis, and widened afterwards [Du, Tepper, and Verdelhan, 2018b]. This pattern suggests that the dollar Libor and the synthetic position based on the foreign Libor and the currency forward have a similar level of convenience yields before the crisis, i.e.,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (- \beta^ {*} \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} - l i b o r _ {t}) \right], \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} - f _ {t} + e _ {t} + l i b o r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

This is not a coincidence if there are investment banks who are indifferent between the two positions and actively arbitrage any spread between the Libor market and the currency forward market. As such, both the dollar Libor and the synthetic dollar bond earn the same, non-zero convenience yield  $\beta^{*}\lambda_{t}^{*}$ , so that their spread, i.e., the Libor basis  $x_{t}^{Libor}$ , is zero.

After the crisis, likely due to regulatory constraints, the dollar Libor now contains a higher level of convenience yield, and banks face higher costs to arbitrage this spread.2 As a result, the dollar Libor has a higher level of convenience yield than the synthetic dollar bond, leading to a negative Libor basis:

$$
\exp (- \gamma^ {*} \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} - l i b o r _ {t}) \right],
$$

$$
\exp \left(- \beta^ {*} \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} - f _ {t} + e _ {t} + l i b o r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right];
$$

with  $\gamma^{*} > \beta^{*}$

$$
x _ {t} ^ {\text {L i b o r}} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \operatorname {l i b o r} _ {t} - \left(\operatorname {l i b o r} _ {t} ^ {*} - f _ {t} + e _ {t}\right) = - \left(\gamma^ {*} - \beta^ {*}\right) \lambda_ {t} ^ {*} <   0.
$$

There is a debate about whether the post-crisis regulations distort the interest rate market or the currency forward market [Augustin, Chernov, Schmid, and Song, 2020].

Finally, if the same marginal investors trade in the Libor market and the Treasury market, then, we should expect that the Treasury basis and the Libor basis are correlated with each other, with

$$
x _ {t} ^ {T r e a s} = - (1 - \beta^ {*}) \lambda_ {t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
x _ {t} ^ {\text {L i b o r}} = - \left(\gamma^ {*} - \beta^ {*}\right) \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

The same argument can be applied to other types of interest rate spreads. The key point is that, when both interest rates contain certain amount of convenience yields, the spread only measures a fraction of the convenience yields. It is useful to think about these bonds as containing different shades of dollarness.

# 4.D Connecting the Short Term with the Long Term

The convenience yields accrue to bonds that are safe and liquid, which is why we begin our analysis with one-period Treasury bill. In this section, we broaden our perspective by considering how the convenience yield on the short-term bond also affects the pricing of the long-term bond. To do so, we first focus on the domestic households' perspective and understand how the convenience yields affect the long-term bond prices. Then, we study how the home and foreign households trade the long-term bonds with each other and understand how the convenience yields and bond risk premia jointly determine the exchange rate level.

# 4.D.1 The Term Structure of Bond Yields with Convenience Yields

We start with the model developed in Section 4.A, and additionally allow the households to trade long-term bonds. Specifically, let  $q_{t}(h)$  denote the book value of the home households' holding of the bond with maturity  $h$  and let  $p_{t}(h)$  denote the price of the bond with maturity  $h$ . All bonds are risk-free. We still assume that the investors derive utility only from holding the 1-period bond:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (u (c _ {t}) + v (q _ {t} (1) p _ {t} (1); \theta_ {t})) \right].
$$

However, because the long-term Treasury bonds will eventually become short-term bonds as they mature, if the investors do not differentiate between on-the-run and off-the-run bonds, then, the convenience yield on the short-term bonds will also affect the pricing of the long-term bonds.

Similar to the model in Section 4.A, we can derive the households'

Euler equation for holding the 1-period bond as

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} 1 - \frac {v ^ {\prime} (q _ {t} (1) ; \theta_ {t})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t, t + 1}) \frac {1}{p _ {t} (1)} \right],
$$

where the convenience yield  $\lambda_{t}$  reflects the marginal utility derived from the convenience benefits of the 1-period bond. Rearranging terms, we obtain

$$
p _ {t} (1) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t, t + 1}\right) \right] \exp (\lambda_ {t}).
$$

Now, consider the 2-period bond. We can write the households' Euler equation for this bond as

$$
p _ {t} (2) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t, t + 1}) p _ {t + 1} (1) \right],
$$

which does not contain a convenience yield term since the 2-period bond does not offer any immediate convenience benefits. However, if we substitute the 1-period bond price into the equation, we obtain

$$
p _ {t} (2) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t, t + 1} + \lambda_ {t + 1}\right) \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1, t + 2}\right) \right] \right],
$$

which implies that the bond price today reflects the expectation of the bond's convenience yield when it becomes 1-period bond in the next period. In this way, the convenience yield that only accrues to the short-term bond can affect the entire term structure of bond prices.

Moreover, the next period's convenience yield  $\lambda_{t+1}$  is priced by the SDF  $m_{t,t+1}$  in the sense that their covariance also matters. We can rewrite the 2-period bond price as

$$
\begin{array}{l} p _ {t} (2) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t, t + 1}\right) \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1, t + 2}\right) \right] \right] \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(\lambda_ {t + 1}\right) \right] \\ + c o v _ {t} \left(\exp \left(m _ {t, t + 1}\right) \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1, t + 2}\right) \right], \exp \left(\lambda_ {t + 1}\right)\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

On the right-hand side, the first term shows that a higher expected convenience yield increases the price of the 2-period bond today, and the second term shows that a more counter-cyclical convenience yield can additionally raise the bond price by lowering its risk premium.

We can iteratively derive the valuation of the longer-term bonds from that of the nearer-term bonds. Jiang and Richmond [2022] provide a general affine expression for the bond price in this setting under the additional assumption that the SDF volatility and the convenience yield jointly follow an affine process. As we expected, the 1-period bond's convenience yield and its cyclical property affects not only the long-term bonds' expected service flows and prices, but also their cyclical properties and hence risk premia.

More realistically, we can additionally assume that the investors derive utility from holding long-term bonds as well. In this case, we

can generalize the function  $v$  as

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (u (c _ {t}) + v (\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} w _ {t} (h) q _ {t} (h) p _ {t} (h); \theta_ {t})) \right],
$$

where the weight  $w_{t}(h)$  describes the relative amount of convenience generated by the bond with maturity  $h$ . For example, if the nonpecuniary utility is generated by the bonds' plegeability in the repo market, then,  $w_{t}(h)$  describes the different hair cuts on the bonds with different maturities.

In this more general setting, the long-term bonds price in both their own convenience yields in the current period and the expected convenience yields of the shorter-term bonds in the future. Interestingly, after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the long-term Treasury bonds are traded at a discount relative to other safe assets, reflecting an "inconvenience yield" [Duffie, 2020, He, Nagel, and Song, 2022, Du, Hébert, and Li, 2023]. This negative yield spread can be understood as a negative marginal utility investors derive from holding the long-term Treasury bonds, or, equivalently, a positive balance sheet cost. Moreover, Joslin, Li, and Song [2021] measures the term structure of the convenience yield using the spread between Treasury bonds and Refcorp bonds.

# 4.D.2 Long-Run UIIP Condition

Next, we consider both home and foreign households' perspectives. When there is a convenience yield on the one-period bond and when markets are incomplete, the equilibrium exchange rate movement deviates from complete-market formula we derived in Proposition 4.3, i.e.,

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {c m} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}.
$$

As such, we can express the exchange rate movement as

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \eta_ {t + 1},
$$

where the new term  $\eta_{t + 1}$  introduces a wedge in the exchange rate expression. We will discuss this term in greater detail in the next section. For now, it is sufficient to note that this term could be correlated with the convenience yield  $\lambda_t^*$ .

We can express this equation iteratively from period 0:

$$
e _ {t} - e _ {0} = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {t} \left(m _ {k} - m _ {k} ^ {*}\right) + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {t} \eta_ {k}.
$$

Jiang, Krishnamurthy, Lustig, and Sun [2021b] show that, if the cumulative wedge  $\sum_{k=1}^{t} \eta_k$  is a random walk, the cumulative SDF differential  $\sum_{k=1}^{t} (m_k - m_k^*)$  needs to have a permanent component that

exactly offsets the random walk component in the cumulative wedge in order to guarantee exchange rate stationarity. This means that the home and foreign SDFs will not share the same permanent component. Instead, they have to diverge from each other for the exchange rate to remain stationary.

As a result, the long-term bond yields, which are closely related to the long-run properties of the home and foreign SDFs, no longer converge between the two countries:

$$
\lim _ {h \to \infty} \left(r _ {t} (h) - r _ {t} ^ {*} (h)\right) \neq 0.
$$

Then, the long-run UIP condition (3.21) that we derived in Proposition 3.10 under the assumption of identical permanent SDF components fails:

$$
e _ {t} - \bar {e} \neq \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} h \left(r _ {t} (h) - r _ {t} ^ {*} (h)\right).
$$

In fact, the left-hand side is finite whereas the right-hand side can be infinite in this case. The convenience yield also introduces a wedge in this long-run UIP condition. A full characterization of this wedge remains an open question.

# 4.E Discussions (TODO)

# Incomplete Markets

# Summary

- Incomplete markets also lead to a wedge between the exchange rate movement and the SDF differential:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \eta_ {t + 1}.
$$

- This wedge affects the exchange rate volatility, cyclicality, and currency risk premium.  
- This wedge also gives rise to international spill-over across countries.  
- Market incompleteness is a precondition for convenience yields to impact the exchange rate dynamics, and convenience yields enrich the effects of market incompleteness on the exchange rate dynamics.

In general, the absence of complete spanning in the asset market means that the home and foreign households do not equate their SDFs state by state. So the exchange rate expression (1.16) in the complete-market case is violated:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} \neq m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}.
$$

Backus, Foresi, and Telmer [2001] introduces a wedge  $\eta$  to describe this violation:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \eta_ {t + 1}. \tag {5.1}
$$

In this section, we first develop a full general equilibrium model with incomplete markets that gives rise to the above wedge  $\eta_{t+1}$ . We then take a different, no-arbitrage approach that focuses only on the Euler equations. While incomplete spanning leads to deviations from the complete-market characterization of the exchange rate dynamics (1.16), it still respects the Euler equations for the assets that are tradable by both countries' households. For example, if home and foreign

risk-free bonds are tradable, the original Euler equation (1.6) holds, i.e.,

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) ],
$$

which does not require us to introduce additional Euler equation wedges as we did in our discussion of convenience yields in Chapter 4, i.e.,

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right].
$$

In this sense, the incomplete-market wedge  $\eta$  in Eq. (5.1) is conceptually distinct from the Euler equation wedge  $\lambda_{t}$ . We will further develop these model ingredients throughout this section.

Conceptually, there are two types of market incompleteness, one at the individual level and one at the country level. Markets can be incomplete at the individual level, which has been studied in a large macro literature starting from Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett. Markets can also be incomplete between countries, leading to incomplete risk-sharing at the country level. In this section, we will focus on the latter form of market incompleteness. We allow the individual-level risk to be fully shared within countries, and model the representative household in each country. At the same time, the representative households in different countries cannot trade the full set of contingent claims to share risks internationally, leading to richer exchange rate and capital flow dynamics.

# 5.A An Illustrative Model

Again we begin with a fully specified model. This is particularly useful in the context of incomplete markets, as the incomplete-market wedge  $\eta_{t + 1}$  in Eq. (5.1) is particularly difficult to conceptualize in the absence of such a model.

As the discussion of incomplete-market exchange rate dynamics is necessarily abstract, we begin by presenting a concrete general equilibrium model with incomplete markets. This model is a variant of Pavlova and Rigobon [2012], with the key difference being that Pavlova and Rigobon [2012] has one international bond whose payoff is a weighted average of home and foreign goods, whereas our model has a home bond and a foreign bond that we considered in the previous sections.

# 5.A.1 The Economic Setting

For tractability, we now use some continuous-time math. There is a finite horizon  $T$ . The home and foreign endowment processes are

given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} d y _ {t} = \mu_ {v} y _ {t} d t + \sigma_ {y} y _ {t} d Z _ {t} ^ {y}, \\ d y _ {t} ^ {*} = \mu_ {y ^ {*}} y _ {t} ^ {*} d t + \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} y _ {t} ^ {*} d Z _ {t} ^ {y ^ {*}}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The home households' utility is given by

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) u (c _ {t}) d t \right],
$$

where  $u(c_{t}) = \gamma_{t}\log (c_{t})$  and the aggregate consumption is again a Cobb-Douglas aggregation of the home and foreign goods:  $c_{t} = (c_{H,t})^{\alpha}(c_{F,t})^{(1 - \alpha)}$ . Relative to the baseline model, here we additionally have a stochastic term  $\gamma_{t}$  which captures demand shocks. We assume that  $\gamma_{t}$  follows

$$
d \gamma_ {t} = 0 d t + \gamma_ {t} \omega d Z _ {t} ^ {\gamma},
$$

which guarantees that  $\gamma_{t}$  is a strictly positive adapted stochastic process and a martingale.

The foreign households' utility is given by

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) u ^ {*} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) d t \right],
$$

where  $u^{*}(c_{t}^{*}) = \gamma^{*}\log (c_{t}^{*})$  and  $c_{t}^{*} = (c_{F,t}^{*})^{\alpha}(c_{H,t}^{*})^{(1 - \alpha)}$ . We assume that there are no time-varying demand shocks for foreign household, i.e.  $\gamma^{*}$  is constant.

More formally, we fix a probability space  $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$  and a given filtration  $\mathbb{F} = \{\mathcal{F}_0 : t \geq 0\}$  satisfying the usual conditions. We assume that all stochastic processes are adapted to this filtration. Specifically, uncertainty is represented by a standard three-dimensional Brownian motion  $Z_t = [Z_t^y, Z_t^{y^*}, Z_t^\gamma]$ .

The only tradable assets are the two countries' risk-free bonds, which are denominated in the local consumption bundles and have interest rates  $r_t$  and  $r_t^*$ , respectively. The real exchange rate  $\exp(e_t)$  is the conversion ratio between the home and foreign consumption bundles. 1 unit of the home bundle is worth  $\exp(e_t)$  units of the foreign bundle. Furthermore, assume that the log exchange rate follows

$$
d e _ {t} = \kappa_ {t} d t + \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t},
$$

where  $\sigma_{t} = [\sigma_{1,t},\sigma_{2,t},\sigma_{3,t}]$  is a 1 by 3 vector. By Ito's lemma, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} d \exp (e _ {t}) = \exp (e _ {t}) \left[ \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \right] d t + \exp (e _ {t}) \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t}, \\ d \exp (- e _ {t}) = \exp (- e _ {t}) \left[ - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \right] d t - \exp (- e _ {t}) \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

From the perspective of the home household, the instantaneous return on foreign bonds is:

$$
\left[ r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \right] d t - \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t}.
$$

In addition, from the viewpoint of the foreign household, the instantaneous return on home bonds is:

$$
\left[ r _ {t} + \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \right] d t + \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t}.
$$

The derivation of the within-period solution is identical to Section 1.A.3 in the baseline model. Let  $p_t$  denote the price of the home goods in the numérique of the home consumption bundle, and let  $p_t^*$  denote the price of the foreign goods in the numérique of the foreign consumption bundle. As a special case of the baseline model, the home households' within-period allocation satisfies

$$
c _ {H, t} = \frac {\alpha}{p _ {t}} c _ {t}, \quad c _ {F, t} = \frac {(1 - \alpha)}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})} c _ {t},
$$

and the terms of trade are simply the ratio of prices between home and foreign goods, which is related to the real exchange rate by  $e_t = (2\alpha - 1) \text{tot}_t$ .

Let  $w_{t}$  denote the wealth of the home households in the home numérique. The dynamic budget constraint of the home households is

$$
d w _ {t} = w _ {t} \left[ r _ {t} + x _ {t} \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t}\right) \right] d t - w _ {t} x _ {t} \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t} + p _ {t} y _ {t} d t - \left[ p _ {t} c _ {H, t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) c _ {F, t} \right] d t,
$$

where  $x_{t}$  is the fraction of wealth that is invested in foreign bonds.

Similarly, let  $w_{t}^{*}$  denote the wealth of the foreign households in the foreign numérique. The dynamic budget constraint of the foreign households is

$$
d w _ {t} ^ {*} = w _ {t} ^ {*} \left[ r _ {t} ^ {*} + x _ {t} ^ {*} \left(r _ {t} + \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right] d t + w _ {t} ^ {*} x _ {t} ^ {*} \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} d t - \left[ p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t}) c _ {H, t} ^ {*} + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} ^ {*} \right] d t,
$$

where  $x_{t}^{*}$  is the fraction of wealth that is invested in home bonds.

To simplify the derivation, let  $\tilde{w}_t^* \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} w_t^* \exp(-e_t)$  denote the wealth of the foreign households in the home numétaire. Then, we can express foreign household's dynamic budget constraint in the home numétaire as

$$
d \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} = \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} \left[ r _ {t} + (1 - x _ {t} ^ {*}) \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t}\right) \right] d t - \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} (1 - x _ {t} ^ {*}) \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*} d t - \left[ p _ {t} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} + p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) c _ {F, t} ^ {*} \right] d t.
$$

# 5.A.2 Macro Synthesis

There are 3 exogenous processes

$$
(y _ {t}, y _ {t} ^ {*}, \gamma_ {t}) _ {t = 0} ^ {t}
$$

and 15 endogenous processes:

$$
(c _ {t}, c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}, w _ {t}, x _ {t}, p _ {t}, c _ {t} ^ {*}, c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}, w _ {t} ^ {*}, x _ {t} ^ {*}, p _ {t} ^ {*}, r _ {t}, r _ {t} ^ {*}, e _ {t}) _ {t = 0} ^ {T},
$$

The model implies the following 15 equations in each period  $t$ , which are very similar to the equilibrium conditions in the baseline model listed in Section 1.A.6. They include 2 consumption aggregation equations,

$$
c _ {t} = (c _ {H, t}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {F, t}) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} = (c _ {F, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {H, t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

4 household budget constraints,

$$
d w _ {t} = w _ {t} \left[ r _ {t} + x _ {t} \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t}\right) \right] d t - w _ {t} x _ {t} \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t} + p _ {t} y _ {t} d t - \left[ p _ {t} c _ {H, t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) c _ {F, t} \right] d t,
$$

$$
c _ {t} = p _ {t} c _ {H, t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}),
$$

$$
d w _ {t} ^ {*} = w _ {t} ^ {*} \left[ r _ {t} ^ {*} + x _ {t} ^ {*} \left(r _ {t} + \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right] d t + w _ {t} ^ {*} x _ {t} ^ {*} \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} d t - \left[ p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t}) c _ {H, t} ^ {*} + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} ^ {*} \right] d t,
$$

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} = p _ {t} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} \exp (e _ {t}) + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

2 equations that describe the households' within-period consumption choices,

$$
\frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})} = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}},
$$

2 goods market clearing conditions,

$$
y _ {t} = c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
y _ {t} ^ {*} = c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

1 bond market clearing condition,

$$
w _ {t} x _ {t} = w _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) x _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

and 4 Euler equations,

$$
0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ d \exp \left(m _ {t} + \int_ {0} ^ {t} r _ {u}\right) \right],
$$

$$
0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ d \exp \left(m _ {t} - e _ {t} + \int_ {0} ^ {t} r _ {u} ^ {*}\right) \right],
$$

$$
0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ d \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {*} + \int_ {0} ^ {t} r _ {u} ^ {*}\right) \right],
$$

$$
0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ d \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {*} + e _ {t} + \int_ {0} ^ {t} r _ {u}\right) \right],
$$

where the consumption-based SDFs are defined as

$$
\exp (m _ {t}) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \exp (- \delta t) \frac {\gamma_ {t} c _ {0}}{\gamma_ {0} c _ {t}},
$$

$$
\exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \exp \left(- \delta t\right) \frac {c _ {0} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}.
$$

# 5.A.3 Portfolio Choices

The home household's portfolio choice problem is

$$
\max  _ {c _ {t}, x _ {t}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) \gamma_ {t} \log c _ {t} d t \right]
$$

$$
\mathrm {s . t .} d w _ {t} = w _ {t} \left[ r _ {t} + x _ {t} \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t}\right) \right] d t + (p _ {t} y _ {t} - c _ {t}) d t - w _ {t} x _ {t} \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t}.
$$

Similarly, noting that the log preference allows separation between the consumption choice and the numétaire, i.e.,

$$
\log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \log \tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*} + e _ {t},
$$

where the exchange rate  $e_t$  is unaffected by the decision of the competitive households, we can express foreign household's portfolio choice problem as

$$
\max _ {\tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*}, x _ {t} ^ {*}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) \gamma^ {*} \log \tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*} d t \right]
$$

$$
\mathrm {s . t .} d \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} = \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} \left[ r _ {t} + (1 - x _ {t} ^ {*}) \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t}\right) \right] d t + (p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*} - \tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*}) d t - \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} (1 - x _ {t} ^ {*}) \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t}.
$$

In this way, under the log preference, the optimization problems are formally equivalent to a familiar single-good consumption-investment problem [Pavlova and Rigobon, 2012].

Next, to deal with the market incompleteness, we follow He and Pearson [1991] to convert the above home household's dynamic portfolio choice problem to a static variational problem:

$$
\max  _ {c _ {t}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) \gamma_ {t} \log c _ {t} d t \right] \tag {5.2}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r l} \text {s . t .} & \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (m _ {\nu , t}) (c _ {t} - p _ {t} y _ {t}) d t \right] \leq W _ {0}, \end{array}
$$

where  $\exp(m_{\nu,t})$  denotes an appropriate home SDF. In incomplete markets, multiple SDFs are consistent with no arbitrage, giving rise to an infinite number of the static budget constraint. To characterize this family of SDFs, let  $\lambda_t$  denote the home country market price of risk,

$$
\lambda_ {t} = \frac {- \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{| | \sigma_ {t} | | ^ {2}} \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t}\right),
$$

which is a 3 by 1 vector. Then, the set of home SDFs can be represented as

$$
d \exp (m _ {\nu , t}) = - r _ {t} \exp (m _ {\nu , t}) d t - \left(\lambda_ {t} + \nu_ {t}\right) ^ {\prime} \exp (m _ {\nu , t}) d Z _ {t},
$$

where  $\nu_{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$  satisfies  $\sigma_{t}\nu_{t} = 0$  for any  $t \in [0,T]$  and  $\int_0^T ||\nu_t||^2 dt < \infty$ .

It is worth noting that this family of SDFs correctly price the home and foreign bonds:

$$
\mathcal {A} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {\nu , t} + \int_ {0} ^ {t} r _ {t} d t\right) \right] = 0,
$$

$$
\mathcal {A} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {\nu , t} - e _ {t} + \int_ {0} ^ {t} r _ {t} ^ {*} d t\right) \right] = 0,
$$

where  $\mathcal{A}[w_t]$  is the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic process  $w_t$ .

When we have three non-redundant risky assets, the markets are complete, and the volatility matrix  $\sigma_t$  is a non-degenerate square matrix. In this case, the equation  $\sigma_t\nu_t = 0$  only has one solution:  $\nu_t = 0$ . In contrast, when the markets are incomplete, the volatility matrix  $\sigma_t$  has fewer rows than the number of uncertainty shocks, and many  $\nu_t$  can satisfy  $\sigma_t\nu_t = 0$ .

Similarly, for foreign households, the static problem is

$$
\max  _ {\tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) \gamma^ {*} \log \tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*} d t \right] \tag {5.3}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {s . t .} & \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu}, t}) (\tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*} - p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}) d t \right] \leq \tilde {W} _ {0} ^ {*}, \end{array}
$$

where

$$
d \exp (m _ {\tilde {v}, t}) = - r _ {t} \exp (m _ {\tilde {v}, t}) d t - \left(\lambda_ {t} + \tilde {v} _ {t}\right) ^ {\prime} \exp (m _ {\tilde {v}, t}) d Z _ {t}.
$$

He and Pearson [1991] prove that there exists a unique individual-specific  $\nu_{t}$ , which we denote by  $\nu_{H,t}$  for home households, that minimizes their maximum expected utility in Eq. (5.2). This  $\nu_{H,t}$  is the one that makes the constraint bind. Pavlova and Rigobon [2012] refer to the home country SDF related to this  $\nu_{H,t}$  as the personalized home country SDF of the home households. Similarly, let the home country SDF related to  $\tilde{\nu}_{F,t}$  denote the personalized home country SDF of the foreign households, which is also in the unit of the home numérique.

It is no coincidence that the home and foreign countries' personalized SDFs are exactly their households' consumption-based SDFs, as we summarize in the following lemma.

Lemma 5.1. (1) The consumption-based SDF of the home households is  $\exp(-\delta t)\frac{\gamma_t c_0}{\gamma_0 c_t}$ , and it is equal to the personalized home country SDF of the home households,  $\exp(m_{\nu_H, t})$ .

(2) The consumption-based SDF of the foreign households is  $\exp (-\delta t)\frac{c_0^*}{c_t^*}$ , and it is equal to the personalized foreign country SDF of the foreign households,  $\exp (m_{\nu_F^*,t}^*)$ .

The proof is presented in Appendix A.14.

We report the portfolios of both home and foreign consumers in the following proposition.

Proposition 5.1. (1) The fraction of wealth  $x_{t}$  invested in the foreign bonds by the home households is given by

$$
x _ {t} = - \frac {w _ {t} + s _ {t}}{w _ {t}} \left(\frac {\omega \sigma_ {3 , t}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}} - \frac {\left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t}\right)}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}\right) + \frac {s _ {t}}{w _ {t}} \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {s} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}, \tag {5.4}
$$

and the fraction of wealth  $x_{t}^{*}$  invested in the home bonds by the foreign households is given by

$$
x _ {t} ^ {*} = 1 - \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t}\right)}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}} - \frac {\tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}. \tag {5.5}
$$

(2) The processes  $\nu_{H}$  and  $\tilde{\nu}_{F}$ , which enter the specification of the home state price densities personalized for the home and foreign households respectively, are given by:

$$
\nu_ {H, t} = \left(I _ {3} - \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {t}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}\right) \left(- \omega i _ {3} ^ {\prime} + \frac {s _ {t}}{w _ {t} + s _ {t}} (\sigma_ {t} ^ {s}) ^ {\prime}\right),
$$

$$
\tilde {v} _ {F, t} = \frac {\tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}} \left(I _ {3} - \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {t}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}\right) (\sigma_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}}) ^ {\prime},
$$

where  $I_{3}$  is a 3-dimensional identity matrix.

The proof is presented in Appendix A.15. The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (5.4) as is the mean-variance efficient portfolio, because it is the solution of a myopic mean-variance investor. The second term is referred to as the hedging portfolio, because, as we will see in Section 9.B, it hedges the variations in the investment opportunities. Without the demand shock  $\gamma_{t},\sigma_{3,t} = 0$ , and the hedging portfolio is zero as in the standard log cases.

# 5.A.4 Characterization of Equilibrium

An equilibrium in our economy is defined in a standard way: it is a collection of goods and asset prices that satisfy certain conditions

$$
\left(p _ {t}, p _ {t} ^ {*}, e _ {t}, r _ {t}, r _ {t} ^ {*}\right)
$$

and consumption-investment policies

$$
\left(c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}, c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}, x _ {t}, x _ {t} ^ {*}\right)
$$

such that (i) each consumer-investor maximizes their utility subject to the budget constraint, and (ii) goods and bond markets clear.

In the presence of incomplete markets, the equilibrium allocation is Pareto optimal. We need to employ a fictitious representative agent with stochastic weights [Cuoco and He, 1994], which reflect the effects of market incompleteness. This fictitious representative agent

maximizes its utility subject to the resource constraints:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \max _ {c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}, c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) (u (c _ {t}) + \pi_ {t} u ^ {*} (c _ {t} ^ {*})) d t \right] \\ \begin{array}{r l} \mathbf {s}. \mathbf {t}. & c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = y _ {t}, c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = y _ {t} ^ {*}, \end{array} \\ \end{array}
$$

where the Pareto weight  $\pi_t$  is stochastic. It can be shown that  $\pi_t$  is simply the ratio of the marginal utilities of either good of the two countries' households, which reflects the relative importance the planner assigns to the foreign households relative to the home households.

The social planner's optimization problem implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {H, t} = \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} y _ {t}, \quad c _ {F, t} = \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} y _ {t} ^ {*}, \tag {5.6} \\ c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} y _ {t}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} y _ {t} ^ {*}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The equilibrium terms of trade that arise in the competitive equilibrium is equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities of the home and foreign goods for either country:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (t o t _ {t}) = \left(\frac {\partial u (c _ {H , t} , c _ {F , t})}{\partial c _ {H , t}}\right) / \left(\frac {\partial u (c _ {H , t} , c _ {F , t})}{\partial c _ {F , t}}\right) = \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha}{c _ {H , t}}\right) / \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha)}{c _ {F , t}}\right), \\ \exp (t o t _ {t}) = \left(\frac {\partial u ^ {*} (c _ {H , t} ^ {*} , c _ {F , t} ^ {*})}{\partial c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) / \left(\frac {\partial u ^ {*} (c _ {H , t} ^ {*} , c _ {F , t} ^ {*})}{\partial c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right) = \left(\frac {\gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) / \left(\frac {\gamma^ {*} \alpha}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

From either equation, plug in Eq. (5.6) and we have:

$$
\exp (t o t _ {t}) = \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \frac {y _ {t} ^ {*}}{y _ {t}}.
$$

We next use the no-arbitrage valuation principle to obtain the valuation of the untraded stocks and the equilibrium wealth.

Lemma 5.2. Equilibrium home and foreign stock prices in their respective local numériaires are given by

$$
s _ {t} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} y _ {t}, \quad s _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

and the wealth of the countries in their local numéraires are given by:

$$
w _ {t} + s _ {t} = \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} s _ {t}, \quad w _ {t} ^ {*} + s _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} s _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.16. By Lemma 5.2, we can express the home and foreign wealth in the home numétaire as

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {t} + s _ {t} = \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} y _ {t}, \\ \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ \end{array}
$$

which yield a simple interpretation of the stochastic Pareto weight  $\pi_t$ .

Lemma 5.3. The Pareto weight is determined by the relative wealth of the two countries' households, i.e.,  $w_{t} + s_{t}$  and  $\tilde{w}_{t}^{*} + \tilde{s}_{t}^{*}$ , scaled by their discount rates  $\gamma_{t}$  and  $\gamma^{*}$ :

$$
\pi_ {t} = \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{w _ {t} + s _ {t}} \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{\gamma^ {*}}. \tag {5.7}
$$

As Eq. (5.6) shows, incomplete markets enrich the dynamics of the economy with an additional state variable  $\pi_t$ , which is determined by the wealth distribution and the discount rates. As such, path dependence naturally arises from incomplete-market models, as the wealth distribution is not easily determined by the current state variables, but rather reflects the history of the shocks to the economy.

With these results, we are now ready to characterize the equilibrium dynamics of the economy.

Proposition 5.2. (1) In an equilibrium, the stochastic weight that the fictitious social planner assigns to the Foreign country,  $\pi_t$ , has the following dynamics:

$$
d \pi_ {t} = \pi_ {t} \left(\tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} - \nu_ {H, t}\right) ^ {\prime} d Z _ {t}.
$$

If both countries' households hold their own endowment tree in period 0, we can determine  $\pi_0$  as:

$$
\pi_ {0} = \frac {\gamma_ {0}}{\gamma^ {*}}.
$$

(2) When such equilibrium exists, the log exchange rate dynamics follow

$$
d e _ {t} = \kappa_ {t} d t + \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t},
$$

where

$$
\frac {1}{2 \alpha - 1} \kappa_ {t} = \mu_ {y ^ {*}} - \mu_ {y} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \frac {\| \alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime} \| ^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)) ^ {2}} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\| (1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime} \| ^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha) ^ {2}}
$$

$$
\frac {1}{2 \alpha - 1} \sigma_ {t} = - \sigma_ {y} i _ {1} + \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} i _ {2} + \frac {\alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}.
$$

(3) The log home state price density based on the home household's consumption,  $m_{\nu_H,t}$ , follows

$$
d m _ {\nu_ {H}, t} = \mu_ {m, t} d t + \sigma_ {m, t} d Z _ {t},
$$

where

$$
\mu_ {m, t} = - \delta + \frac {\alpha - 1}{2 \alpha - 1} \kappa_ {t} - \mu_ {y} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \frac {| | \alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + (1 - \alpha) \gamma^ {*} \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime} | | ^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)) ^ {2}},
$$

$$
\sigma_ {m, t} = \frac {\alpha - 1}{2 \alpha - 1} \sigma_ {t} - \sigma_ {y} i _ {1} + \frac {\alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + (1 - \alpha) \gamma^ {*} \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)},
$$

and the log foreign state price density based on the foreign household's consumption,  $m_{\nu_F^*,t'}^*$  follows

$$
d m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*} = \mu_ {m ^ {*}, t} d t + \sigma_ {m ^ {*}, t} d Z _ {t},
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mu_ {m ^ {*}, t} = - \delta + \frac {1 - \alpha}{2 \alpha - 1} \kappa_ {t} - \mu_ {y ^ {*}} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{2} (\| \nu_ {H, t} \| ^ {2} - \| \tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} \| ^ {2}) - \frac {1}{2} \frac {| | (1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \alpha \gamma^ {*} \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime} | | ^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha) ^ {2}}, \\ \sigma_ {m ^ {*}, t} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{2 \alpha - 1} \sigma_ {t} - \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} i _ {2} - (\tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} - \nu_ {H, t}) ^ {\prime} + \frac {(1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \alpha \gamma^ {*} \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Then, we can introduce a stochastic wedge  $\eta_t$  that reconciles the log exchange rate movement with the domestic and foreign consumption-based SDFs:

$$
d e _ {t} = d m _ {\nu_ {H}, t} - d m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*} + d \eta_ {t}, \tag {5.8}
$$

where

$$
d \eta_ {t} = \frac {1}{2} \left(\left\| \nu_ {H, t} \right\| ^ {2} - \left\| \tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} \right\| ^ {2}\right) d t + \left(\nu_ {H, t} - \tilde {\nu} _ {F, t}\right) ^ {\prime} d Z _ {t}.
$$

(4) We can then express the market price of risk  $\lambda_{t}$ , and the interest rates  $r_t$  and  $r_t^*$  as functions of exogenous state variables.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \lambda_ {t} = - \sigma_ {m, t} ^ {\prime} - v _ {H, t}, \\ r _ {t} = - \mu_ {m, t} - \frac {1}{2} \| \sigma_ {m, t} \| ^ {2}, \\ r _ {t} ^ {*} = - \sigma_ {t} \lambda_ {t} + \kappa_ {t} - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} + r _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.17. This proposition solves the equilibrium exchange rate, SDF, and risk premium dynamics implicitly as functions of  $\nu_{H,t}$  and  $\tilde{\nu}_{F,t}$ , which are themselves functions of the exchange rate dynamics and wealth distribution. The central equation is (5.8), which shows that the exchange rate movement is no longer equal to the SDF differential as we saw in the complete-market model in Section 1.C. Instead, an additional wedge  $d\eta_t$  arises and gives to additional variations in the exchange rate. As such, we refer to the  $d\eta_t$  term as the incomplete-market wedge. However, this wedge is driven by the same fundamental shocks  $dZ_t$  that drive the SDF processes. In this sense, the additional exchange rate variations in incomplete-market models are not necessarily non-fundamental.

# 5.A.5 Comparison with the Complete-Market Case

When the markets are complete, the model we consider reduces to a special case of Pavlova and Rigobon [2007]. The social planner

maximizes the following objective function with a constant Pareto weight:

$$
\max  _ {c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}, c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}} \quad \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) (u (c _ {t}) + \pi u ^ {*} (c _ {t} ^ {*})) d t \right]
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c c} \text {s . t .} & c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = y _ {t}, \quad c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = y _ {t} ^ {*}, \end{array}
$$

which implies

$$
c _ {H, t} = \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} y _ {t}, \quad c _ {F, t} = \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} y _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} y _ {t}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} y _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

The equilibrium terms of trade that arise in the competitive equilibrium is equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities of the home and foreign goods for either country:

$$
\exp (t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}) = \left(\frac {\partial u (c _ {H , t} , c _ {F , t})}{\partial c _ {H , t}}\right) / \left(\frac {\partial u (c _ {H , t} , c _ {F , t})}{\partial c _ {F , t}}\right) = \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha}{c _ {H , t}}\right) / \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha)}{c _ {F , t}}\right),
$$

$$
\exp (t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}) = \left(\frac {\partial u ^ {*} (c _ {H , t} ^ {*} , c _ {F , t} ^ {*})}{\partial c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) / \left(\frac {\partial u ^ {*} (c _ {H , t} ^ {*} , c _ {F , t} ^ {*})}{\partial c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right) = \left(\frac {\gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) / \left(\frac {\gamma^ {*} \alpha}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right).
$$

From either equation, plugging in the consumption solutions, we have:

$$
\exp (t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}) = \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \frac {y _ {t} ^ {*}}{y _ {t}}.
$$

Compared to the incomplete-market solution, the Pareto weight  $\pi$  in the complete-market case is a constant. After further simplification, we characterize the exchange rate dynamics in the following proposition.

Proposition 5.3. In the complete-market case, the log exchange rate follows

$$
d e _ {t} ^ {c m} = \kappa_ {t} ^ {c m} d t + \sigma_ {t} ^ {c m} d Z _ {t},
$$

where

$$
\frac {1}{2 \alpha - 1} \kappa_ {t} ^ {c m} = \mu_ {y ^ {*}} - \mu_ {y} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \frac {\alpha^ {2} \gamma_ {t} ^ {2} \omega^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)) ^ {2}} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {(1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \gamma_ {t} ^ {2} \omega^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha) ^ {2}},
$$

$$
\frac {1}{2 \alpha - 1} \sigma_ {t} ^ {c m} = - \sigma_ {y} i _ {1} + \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} i _ {2} + \left(\frac {\alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha}\right) i _ {3}.
$$

Moreover, the SDF dynamics satisfy

$$
d e _ {t} ^ {c m} = d m _ {t} ^ {c m} - d m _ {t} ^ {*}, ^ {c m}.
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.18. This complete-market case restores a continuous-time version of our standard risk-sharing condition (1.16) under complete markets, i.e.,  $\Delta e_{t+1} = m_{t+1} - m_{t+1}^*$ , which is in stark contrast to Eq. (5.8) under the incomplete-market case.

Moreover, Eq. (5.7), reproduced below, also holds in the complete-market case:

$$
\pi = \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*}}{w _ {t}} \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{\gamma^ {*}}. \tag {5.9}
$$

With a constant Pareto weight  $\pi$ , the equilibrium wealth distribution is equal to the ratio of the discount rates. As such, when markets are complete, the wealth distribution does not introduce additional state variables.

# 5.B The No-Arbitrage Approach

The general equilibrium model above demonstrates one particular case in which the exchange rate obeys Eq. (5.1), reproduced below,

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \eta_ {t + 1}.
$$

If we relax the assumption of log preference, the model becomes much more difficult to solve in closed form. In this section, we develop an alternative, no-arbitrage approach to study the properties of the exchange rate dynamics under incomplete markets. This approach is based on Backus, Foresi, and Telmer [2001], Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara [2006], Lustig and Verdelhan [2019].

This approach does not take a stance on the specification of preferences and economic shocks. We only require risk-free bonds to be freely traded across countries, which seems to be a reasonable assumption at least for certain agents in developed economies. We focus on the four Euler equations (1.6)-(1.9) that characterize the home and foreign investors' valuation of the home and foreign risk-free bonds. The financial markets for other assets, such as the equities and long-term bonds, may or may not be traded. In this sense, this no-arbitrage approach provides a general characterization of the exchange rate dynamics under incomplete spanning.

As this approach leaves other markets unspecified, there is a family of exchange rate solutions that are consistent with the Euler equations (1.6)-(1.9). However, this fact does not necessarily imply multiple equilibria. A full specification of goods and asset market clearing usually pins down a unique equilibrium within the family of equilibria that we will study.

Moreover, for any given home SDF  $m_{t + 1}$

$$
m _ {t + 1} ^ {* *} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} m _ {t + 1} - \Delta e _ {t + 1}
$$

is always a valid foreign SDF that is consistent with the asset market equilibrium. While this SDF correctly prices the tradable assets, it does not necessarily coincide with the foreign households' marginal utility growth. To the extent that we are interested in understanding the relationship between the exchange rate dynamics and the macroeconomy, we would like to focus on the home and foreign SDFs that reflect the marginal utility growth, i.e.,

$$
m _ {t + 1} = \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})}, \qquad m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} = \delta \frac {u ^ {* ^ {\prime}} (c _ {t + 1} ^ {*})}{u ^ {* ^ {\prime}} (c _ {t} ^ {*})}.
$$

# 5.B.1 The  $\eta$  Algebra

To explain the restrictions implied by the Euler equations, we plug in  $\Delta e_{t + 1} = m_{t + 1} - m_{t + 1}^{*} + \eta_{t + 1}$  to the Euler equation (1.9), reproduced below,

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) \right],
$$

to obtain

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + \eta_ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right].
$$

In this equation,  $m_{t+1} + \eta_{t+1}$  expresses the foreign households' SDF in the home numétaire, which prices the home risk-free rate.

Together with the Euler equation (1.6), reproduced below,

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right],
$$

and assuming joint normality, they impose a restriction on the joint distribution of  $m_{t+1}$  and  $\eta_{t+1}$ :

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \eta_ {t + 1} \right] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\eta_ {t + 1}\right) + c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, \eta_ {t + 1}\right) = 0. \tag {5.10}
$$

In the language of closed-economy incomplete-market models, we can say that incomplete markets allow multiple SDFs to be consistent with the asset market equilibrium, and  $m_{t+1}$  and  $m_{t+1} + \eta_{t+1}$  are both valid SDFs. However,  $m_{t+1}$  and  $m_{t+1} + \eta_{t+1}$  cannot be arbitrary. The fact that they both price the home risk-free bond implies a restriction, which is what we derived in Eq. (5.10).

Similarly, home and foreign SDFs satisfy the following Euler equations,

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} ^ {*}) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \eta_ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

which imply a restriction on the joint distribution of  $m_{t + 1}^{*}$  and  $\eta_{t + 1}$ :

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \eta_ {t + 1} \right] - \frac {1}{2} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\eta_ {t + 1}\right) + \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \eta_ {t + 1}\right) = 0. \tag {5.11}
$$

The restrictions (5.10) and (5.11) imply

$$
0 = \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \eta_ {t + 1}, \eta_ {t + 1}\right) = \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}, \eta_ {t + 1}\right). \tag {5.12}
$$

This is the key implication of the Euler equations. The incomplete-market wedge  $\eta_{t+1}$  has to exist in the space orthogonal to the exchange rate movement  $\Delta e_{t+1}$ . Otherwise, it will affect how the exchange rate is priced, which makes the two SDFs  $m_{t+1}$  and  $m_{t+1} + \eta_{t+1}$  disagree on the pricing of the foreign currency.

Rearranging (5.12), we obtain

$$
c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \eta_ {t + 1}\right) = - v a r _ {t} \left(\eta_ {t + 1}\right);
$$

that is, in order for the incomplete-market wedge  $\eta_{t+1}$  to be orthogonal to the exchange rate movement  $\Delta e_{t+1}$ , it has to be negatively correlated with the SDF differential  $m_{t+1} - m_{t+1}^*$ . Then, the exchange rate variance becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}) = v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \eta_ {t + 1}) = v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) + v a r _ {t} (\eta_ {t + 1}) + 2 c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \eta_ {t + 1}) \\ = v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) - v a r _ {t} \left(\eta_ {t + 1}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

In other words, since the incomplete-market wedge  $\eta_{t + 1}$  is negatively correlated with the SDF differential  $m_{t + 1} - m_{t + 1}^{*}$ , it reduces the exchange rate volatility relative to the volatility of the SDF differential.

In this way, using this result derived from the Euler equations (1.6)-(1.9), Lustig and Verdelhan [2019] characterize the exchange rate volatility, cyclicality, and risk premium in the presence of the incomplete-market wedge  $\eta_{t+1}$ .

Proposition 5.4. (a) The conditional exchange rate volatility can be expressed as

$$
\operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) - \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\eta_ {t + 1}\right).
$$

(b) The conditional exchange rate cyclicality can be expressed as

$$
\operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right).
$$

(c) The conditional currency risk premium can be expressed as

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] = \frac {1}{2} (v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) - v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1})) + \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \eta_ {t + 1} ].
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.19. When the markets are complete,  $\eta_{t + 1} = 0$ , and the above results reduce to the complete-market solution we considered in Section 1.C, reproduced below:

$$
v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}) = v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}),
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right), \\ \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] = \frac {1}{2} (v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) - v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1})). \\ \end{array}
$$

Relative to this complete-market benchmark, the presence of the incomplete-market wedge  $\eta_{t+1}$  always reduces the exchange rate volatility  $var_t(\Delta e_{t+1})$  relative to the variance of the SDF differential  $var_t(m_{t+1} - m_{t+1}^*)$ . This result shows that market incompleteness is a useful ingredient for resolving the exchange rate puzzles, as we expect the SDF volatility to be much higher than the exchange rate volatility, while the cross-country SDF correlation is not high enough to reduce  $var_t(m_{t+1} - m_{t+1}^*)$  [Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara, 2006]. In the presence of a volatile incomplete-market wedge  $\eta_{t+1}$ , the exchange rate volatility can be much lower than the SDF volatility.

Incomplete markets also shift the currency risk premium  $\mathbb{E}_t[rx_{t + 1}]$  by  $\mathbb{E}_t[\eta_{t + 1}]$ . The Euler equations do not rule out the possibility that  $\mathbb{E}_t[\eta_{t + 1}]$  is nonzero, as long as it satisfies Eq. (5.10) and (5.11). Moreover, because  $\mathbb{E}_t[\eta_{t + 1}]$  is known ex-ante in period  $t$ , increasing the currency risk premium comes at the cost of introducing exchange rate predictability.

Finally, in incomplete markets, the exchange rate cyclicality is still equal to the exchange rate variance:  $cov_{t}(m_{t + 1} - m_{t + 1}^{*}, \Delta e_{t + 1}) = var_{t}(\Delta e_{t + 1})$ . However, because the exchange rate variance can be lower, market incompleteness can shrink the exchange rate cyclicality towards zero as well. That said, as the exchange rate cyclicality has to be positive, incomplete markets alone cannot generate a procyclical exchange rate.

Lustig and Verdelhan [2019] further point out a trade-off between resolving the exchange rate volatility puzzle and the currency risk premium puzzle. The Euler equations impose restrictions on the joint dynamics of the exchange rate movement, the SDF, and  $\eta_{t+1}$ . When we rely on a volatile  $\eta_{t+1}$  to reduce the exchange rate volatility and cyclicality, we also shrink the currency risk premium. To see this dilemma, recall from Proposition 1.1, which is valid in complete and incomplete markets, that the currency risk premium can be expressed as

$$
\log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (r x _ {t + 1}) ] = - c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right).
$$

When a volatile  $\eta_{t + 1}$  term lowers the exchange rate volatility and the covariance between the SDF and the exchange rate movement, it also

reduces the currency risk premium.

# 5.B.2 Exchange Rate Projection

The  $\eta$  algebra above decomposes the exchange rate movement to the SDF differential and the incomplete-market wedge  $\eta$ . From our discussion above, we know that a volatile  $\eta$  term is required to reduce the exchange rate volatility, and  $\eta$ 's drift modifies the currency risk premium.

In this subsection, we develop a different decomposition of the exchange rate movement that is useful for interpreting the effects of market incompleteness on the exchange rate dynamics, which is based on Jiang [2023b]. For expositional convenience, we again assume that all shocks are jointly normal.

Without loss of generality, we can express the exchange rate movement as

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = x _ {t} + y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}, \tag {5.13}
$$

where  $\varepsilon_{t + 1}$  is a standard normal variable with a mean of 0 and a volatility of 1. This expression simply rewrites Eq. (5.1), with

$$
\eta_ {t + 1} = x _ {t} + (y _ {t} - 1) m _ {t + 1} + (z _ {t} + 1) m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}.
$$

We identify the coefficients  $x_{t}, y_{t}, z_{t}$ , and  $w_{t}$  by assuming that the covariance between the SDFs and the residual  $\varepsilon_{t+1}$  is zero, i.e.,  $cov_{t}(m_{t+1}, \varepsilon_{t+1}) = cov_{t}(m_{t+1}^{*}, \varepsilon_{t+1}) = 0$ , which uniquely pins down

$$
y _ {t} = \frac {c o v _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1} , m _ {t + 1}) v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) - c o v _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1} , m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} , m _ {t + 1} ^ {*})}{v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} , m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) ^ {2}},
$$

$$
z _ {t} = \frac {c o v _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1} , m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) - c o v _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1} , m _ {t + 1}) c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} , m _ {t + 1} ^ {*})}{v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} , m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) ^ {2}},
$$

$$
x _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ] - y _ {t} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] - z _ {t} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} ],
$$

$$
w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} = \Delta e _ {t + 1} - x _ {t} - y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} - z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}.
$$

Intuitively, we can think of this decomposition formula as a projection of the exchange rate movement on the home and foreign SDFs. The terms  $y_{t}m_{t + 1}$  and  $z_{t}m_{t + 1}^{*}$  describe how the bilateral exchange rate loads on the SDFs in the two countries, with the coefficients  $y_{t}$  and  $z_{t}$  interpreted as the SDF-FX pass-through. When the markets are complete, the SDFs comove with the exchange rate movement one-for-one (i.e.,  $\Delta e_{t + 1} = m_{t + 1} - m_{t + 1}^{*}$ ), implying a full pass-through of  $y_{t} = 1$  and  $z_{t} = -1$ . As we will see later, when the markets are incomplete,  $|y_{t}|$  and  $|z_{t}|$  can take values lower than 1, reflecting a partial pass-through from the SDFs to the exchange rate.

The last term  $w_{t}\varepsilon_{t + 1}$  captures the residual in the bilateral exchange rate movement that is not explained by the SDFs. Compared to the  $\eta_{t + 1}$  term in Eq. (5.1), the residual  $w_{t}\varepsilon_{t + 1}$  is orthogonal to the SDFs, whereas  $\eta_{t + 1}$  can have arbitrary correlations with both countries' SDFs.

Under joint normality, the exchange rate dynamics can be represented by  $(x_{t},y_{t},z_{t},w_{t})$ . Alternatively, they can also be represented by the expected exchange rate movement  $\mathbb{E}_t[\Delta e_{t + 1}]$ , the bilateral exchange rate movement's variance  $var_t(\Delta e_{t + 1})$ , and its covariances with the two countries' SDFs  $cov_{t}(\Delta e_{t + 1},m_{t + 1})$  and  $cov_{t}(\Delta e_{t + 1},m_{t + 1}^{*})$ .

Using this exchange rate decomposition, we can provide a different characterization of the exchange rate volatility, cyclicality, and risk premium [Jiang, 2023b].

Proposition 5.5. (a) The conditional exchange rate volatility can be expressed as

$$
\operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) + \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}\right).
$$

(b) The conditional exchange rate cyclicality can be expressed as

$$
c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}) = c o v _ {t} (y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}).
$$

(c) Using the Euler equations (1.6)-(1.9), the conditional currency risk premium can be expressed as

$$
r p _ {t} \stackrel {{d e f}} {{=}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] = - \frac {1}{2} c o v _ {t} \left(y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, m _ {t + 1} + m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right).
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.20. As a special case, when markets are complete,  $y_{t} = 1$ ,  $z_{t} = -1$  and  $\varepsilon_{t+1} = 0$ . These exchange rate moments simplify to

$$
\operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {c m}\right) = \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {*} ^ {*}\right),
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {c m}\right) = v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right), \\ r p _ {t} ^ {c m} = - \frac {1}{2} c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, m _ {t + 1} + m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) = \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

which recovers the complete-market solution in Section 1.C.

When markets are incomplete, if the magnitudes of the SDF-FX pass-through coefficients  $y_{t}$  and  $z_{t}$  are smaller than 1, then, we obtain a less volatile SDF term  $y_{t}m_{t + 1} + z_{t}m_{t + 1}^{*}$ , which reduces the exchange rate's variance and covariance with the SDF differential towards 0.

At the same time, a smaller SDF term also reduces the currency risk premium. In this way, we recover the dilemma in Lustig and Verdelhan [2019] that, as market incompleteness reduces the exchange rate volatility, it also shrinks the currency risk premium towards zero. By teasing out the SDF term  $y_{t}m_{t + 1} + z_{t}m_{t + 1}^{*}$  from the residual  $w_{t}\varepsilon_{t + 1}$  in

the exchange rate movement, our decomposition formula shows how this SDF term ties together the exchange rate variance, cyclicality, and the currency risk premium in the general incomplete-market setting.

Moreover, the role of the residual term  $w_{t}\varepsilon_{t + 1}$  is also simple to interpret: while a volatile residual increases the exchange rate variance, it has no effect on the exchange rate cyclicality and the currency risk premium. It can be thought of as a truly idiosyncratic term.

Conversely, given the fact that the exchange rate variance is much lower than the variance of the SDF differential [Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara, 2006], can we derive a bound on the magnitude of the coefficients  $y_{t}$  and  $z_{t}$ ? More specifically, at the annual frequency, the exchange rate volatility between developed countries is in the order of  $10\%$ , implying  $var_{t}\left(\Delta e_{t + 1}\right) = 1\%$ . In comparison, given the existence of financial assets or trading strategies that generate Sharpe ratios above 1, the Hansen and Jagannathan [1991] bound implies  $var_{t}(m_{t + 1}) \geq 1$ . Together, these empirical observations imply the following restriction:

$$
\operatorname{var}_{t}\left(\Delta e_{t + 1}\right)\leq 1\% \cdot \operatorname{var}_{t}(m_{t + 1}). \tag{5.14}
$$

Then, using the Euler equations (1.6)-(1.9), we can derive the following bound on the exchange rate variance.

Proposition 5.6. The Euler equations impose the following constraints on the pass-through coefficients  $y_{t}$  and  $z_{t}$ :

$$
y _ {t} (y _ {t} - 1) v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) + z _ {t} (z _ {t} + 1) v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) +
$$

$$
\left[ y _ {t} \left(z _ {t} + 1\right) + z _ {t} \left(y _ {t} - 1\right) \right] \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \leq 0 \tag {5.15}
$$

$$
y _ {t} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}\right) - z _ {t} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) + \left(z _ {t} - y _ {t}\right) \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}. m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) = \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) \tag {5.16}
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.21. This result shows that, if we take a stance on the variances of the SDFs, we can reject some values of the pass-through coefficients by noting that they generate too much exchange rate volatility. For example, if  $y_{t} = 1$  and  $z_{t} = -1$  as in the complete-market case, Eq. (5.15) becomes  $0 \geq 0$  and Eq. (5.16) becomes  $var_{t}(m_{t + 1} - m_{t + 1}^{*}) = var_{t}(\Delta e_{t + 1})$ , which recovers the key result in Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara [2006].

This proposition generalizes Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara [2006] by asking how much lower the pass-through coefficients  $y_{t}$  and  $z_{t}$  have to be in order to match the exchange rate volatility. If we plug the empirical restriction (5.14) into Eq. (5.16), and additionally assume that the home and foreign SDFs have the same variance, i.e.,  $\sigma_t^2 = var_t(m_{t + 1}) = var_t(m_{t + 1}^*)$ , and that the cross-country SDF correlation is  $corr_t(m_{t + 1},m_{t + 1}^*) = 0.3\$ , which is close to the average cross-country correlation in consumption growth among

developed countries, then, we can graphically represent the two equations in Proposition 5.6 in Figure 5.1. Specifically, Eq. (5.15) requires the coefficients to lie within the red ellipse, and Eq. (5.16) requires the coefficients to lie above the blue line. The intersection of these two regions is very small and close to  $(0,0)$ .

Figure 5.1: Bounds on the Magnitude of the Pass-Through Coefficients

This discussion shows that the pass-through coefficients  $y_{t}$  and  $z_{t}$  have to be very small in order to produce empirically plausible exchange rate volatility. In the numerical example we consider here, the greatest possible magnitude of either coefficient is 0.068, which is much smaller than the complete-market benchmark of 1. As such, this exchange rate decomposition takes one step further and sheds light on the economic interpretation of the incomplete-market wedge  $\eta_{t+1}$  in relation to the SDFs.

# 5.C Multi-Currency Dynamics and International Spill-Over

Market incompleteness also has implications for multi-currency dynamics. As a benchmark, let us first understand the intuition from complete-market models. It suffices to consider only three countries, which we denote by 0, 1, 2. We refer to country 0 as the home country, and countries 1 and 2 as the two foreign countries. The bilateral exchange rate movements between the home country and the two foreign countries are given by

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1} = m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)},
$$

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2} = m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)}.
$$

First, Triangular arbitrage means that the bilateral exchange rates between two foreign countries are directly implied from their bilat-

eral exchange rates with the home country:

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {1 / 2} = \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1} = m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)}. \tag {5.17}
$$

As a result, the three bilateral exchange rates are not mutually independent. Given the simplicity of Eq. (5.17), it suffices to understand the dynamics of the bilateral exchange rates between the home country and each foreign country. The dynamics between the two foreign countries are easily implied.

# 5.C.1 Restrictions from the Euler Equations

When the markets are incomplete, the simple mapping from the SDFs to the bilateral exchange rates no longer holds. It is no longer sufficient to only study the dynamics between the home country and each foreign country. To see this point, consider the Euler equations (1.6)-(1.9) for holding the home and foreign risk-free bonds. Rewriting Eq. (1.12) for countries 0 and 1, we obtain

$$
c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1}\right) = 0. \tag {5.18}
$$

Similarly, for countries 0 and 2, we obtain

$$
c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2}\right) = 0. \tag {5.19}
$$

These equations arise in a large class of two-country models in which risk-free bonds are traded. They are also part of Proposition 5.4 which characterizes the exchange rate cyclicality.

Next, we consider the Euler equations for risk-free bonds between countries 1 and 2, which are

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} + r _ {t} ^ {(1)}) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {1 / 2} + r _ {t} ^ {(2)}) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)} + r _ {t} ^ {(2)}) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {1 / 2} + r _ {t} ^ {(1)}) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

The following proposition shows that these equations give rise to additional restrictions on the exchange rate dynamics [Jiang, 2023b].

Proposition 5.7. The Euler equations for risk-free bonds between countries 1 and 2 imply

$$
c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2}\right) + c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1}\right) = 0. \tag {5.20}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.22. This proposition shows that, while the bilateral exchange rate movements  $\Delta e_{t+1}^{0/1}$  and  $\Delta e_{t+1}^{0/2}$

between the home country and each foreign country directly imply the bilateral exchange rate movement  $\Delta e_{t+1}^{2/1}$  between the two foreign countries, the Euler equations (5.18) and (5.19) between the home country and each foreign country do not imply the Euler equations (5.20) between the two foreign countries in the general case. As a result, when we extend our analysis from two to three countries, the number of independent exchange rate movements increases from 1 to 2, while the number of unique sets of Euler equations for cross-country bond holdings increases from 1 to 3. The additional Euler equations impose restrictions on the exchange rate dynamics that are absent in the two-country setting.

The complete-market case is an exception:  $m_{t+1}^{(0)} - m_{t+1}^{(i)} - \Delta e_{t+1}^{0/i} = 0$  satisfies all the conditions above trivially. Perhaps this is why we are used to studying only the bilateral dynamics between the home country and each foreign country in the complete-market setting, which is no longer sufficient when markets are incomplete, as the Euler equations between the two foreign countries impose additional restrictions on the exchange rate dynamics.

What do these additional restrictions imply for the exchange rate dynamics? To answer this question, we first study a specific three-country model, and then we generalize the results using the no-arbitrage approach.

# 5.C.2 Motivating Example for the Spill-Over Effects

Let us consider a three-country extension of the Pavlova and Rigobon [2012] model we considered in Section 5.A. Again, we consider three countries labeled as 0, 1 and 2. Each country  $i$  has a unique variety of local goods, and a representative agent with log preference scaled by a demand shock  $\gamma_t^{(i)}$ :

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \rho t) \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)} \log c _ {t} ^ {(i)} \right],
$$

and the aggregate consumption is a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of the three countries' local goods. Specifically, let  $c_{j,t}^{(i)}$  denote country  $i$ 's agent's consumption of country  $j$ 's goods, then,

$$
\log c _ {t} ^ {(i)} = \alpha \log c _ {i, t} ^ {(i)} + \sum_ {j \neq i} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} \log c _ {j, t} ^ {(i)}.
$$

Reflecting home bias towards domestic goods,  $\alpha > 1/3$ . Moreover, each country's agent receives a stochastic endowment  $y_{t}^{(i)}$  that follows a simple diffusion process.

The agents in three countries have access to the same asset space. Since the markets are incomplete, the set of tradable assets does

not span the shocks. The risk-free bonds are freely tradable, but the existence of other assets such as equities and long-term bond is not central to our result. For simplicity, we assume that the agents can also trade equities which are claims to the country-level endowment claims.

Let  $\tilde{w}_t^{(i)}$  denote the wealth of country  $i$ 's agent, expressed in a common numérique. We have the following result characterizing the equilibrium exchange rate.

Proposition 5.8. The equilibrium log real exchange rate between the foreign countries 1 and 2 can be expressed as

$$
e _ {t} ^ {1 / 2} = \frac {3 \alpha - 1}{2} \left(\log \frac {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\bar {w} _ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\bar {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} \alpha + \frac {\bar {w} _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\bar {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\bar {w} _ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\bar {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\bar {w} _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\bar {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} \alpha} + \log \frac {y _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{y _ {t} ^ {(1)}}\right),
$$

which depends not only on the endowments  $y_{t}^{(1)}$  and  $y_{t}^{(2)}$ , but also on the endogenous wealth distribution between agents, i.e.,  $\tilde{w}_{t}^{(1)} / \tilde{w}_{t}^{(0)}$  and  $\tilde{w}_{t}^{(2)} / \tilde{w}_{t}^{(0)}$ .

The proof is presented in Appendix A.23. This expression relates the bilateral exchange rate between the foreign countries 1 and 2 to the wealth of country 0's agent. In particular, a shock to country 0's endowment  $y_{t}^{(0)}$  could directly impact the foreign countries' bilateral exchange rate by affecting the wealth distribution. This can happen when the agents in countries 1 and 2 hold different portfolios according to their heterogeneous wealth and preferences, which expose them differently to country 0's endowment shock. In this way, a shock originating from country 0 affects the bilateral exchange rate between countries 1 and 2, which gives us a concrete example of the spill-over effect.

In stark contrast, when the markets are complete, full risk-sharing implies the following wealth distribution:

$$
\frac {\pi^ {(i)}}{\pi^ {(0)}} = \frac {w _ {t} ^ {(i)} / \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)}}{w _ {t} ^ {(0)} / \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}},
$$

where  $\pi^{(i)}$  is the time-invariant Pareto weight in the social planner's optimization. Then, the log exchange rate can be expressed as

$$
e _ {t} ^ {1 / 2, c m} = \frac {3 \alpha - 1}{2} \left(\log \frac {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {\pi^ {(1)}}{\pi^ {(0)}} \alpha + \frac {\gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {\pi^ {(2)}}{\pi^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {\pi^ {(1)}}{\pi^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {\pi^ {(2)}}{\pi^ {(0)}} \alpha} + \log \frac {y _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{y _ {t} ^ {(1)}}\right), \tag {5.21}
$$

which is only a function of the country-specific endowments  $y_{t}^{(1)}$  and  $y_{t}^{(2)}$  and demand shocks  $\gamma_{t}^{(0)}, \gamma_{t}^{(1)}$ , and  $\gamma_{t}^{(2)}$ .

In this way, this specific setting shows a clear distinction between incomplete- and complete-market outcomes: while a shock to country 0's endowment  $y_{t}^{(0)}$  has no impact on the bilateral exchange rate between foreign countries 1 and 2 when markets are complete, it can directly affect the bilateral exchange rate between foreign countries when markets are incomplete. In other words, when markets are incomplete, not only does the bilateral exchange rate movement deviate from the two countries' marginal utility growth differential, i.e.,  $\Delta e_{t+1} \neq m_{t+1} - m_{t+1}^{*}$ , but the bilateral exchange rate also depends on shocks to the third country. A natural question is whether this international spill-over effect is a general feature of incomplete markets, which is explored in the next section.

# Monetary and Fiscal Policies

# Summary

- We develop a stylized model in the New Keynesian tradition. In this model, when prices are flexible, monetary and fiscal policies have no real effects: they do not affect consumption and real exchange rate. They only affect inflation, which affects the nominal interest rate and the nominal exchange rate.  
- When prices are sticky, monetary and fiscal policies have real effects: they influence the real interest rate, which affects consumption and the real exchange rate.  
- Monetary and fiscal policies are not necessarily independent. Taking a strong stance on one policy can affect the other policy.  
- While it is beyond the scope of this chapter, monetary and fiscal policies can affect the exchange rate dynamics through other channels such as the risk premium and the convenience yield as well.

The monetary policies refer to the actions taken by the central bank, which is the Federal Reserve in the U.S. The policy tool includes setting interest rates, controlling the money supply, and conducting other quantity-based operations such as security purchases and sales. The fiscal policies refer to the government's taxation and spending decisions, and the corresponding debt issuance and retirement.

These monetary and fiscal policies play important roles in shaping the exchange rate dynamics. Studying their effects on the exchange rate marks the birthplace of the international macro literature [Mundell, 1963, Fleming, 1962, Dornbusch, 1976, Frankel, 1979]. In this chapter, we develop a stylized but unified model of monetary and fiscal policies to capture the baseline channels, in which monetary and fiscal policies affect the exchange rate dynamics by shaping the real risk-free rates. It represents a standard way of modeling these policies in the macro and monetary literature. However, given

our discussion in the beginning of Chapter 3, it is likely that monetary and fiscal policies also affect the exchange rates through the risk premium and the convenience yield channels. We return to this issue at the end of this chapter.

# 6.A Introducing the Nominal Layer

In this chapter, we will consider a model with the nominal layer for the first time. Let us begin with some basic definitions and characterizations, which apply to not only this model but most models with a nominal layer. In particular, we may introduce home and foreign currencies to the baseline model in Section 1.A and consider it as a special case.

Let  $P_{t}$  denote the price index in the home country, which measures the price of the home consumption bundle in the unit of the local currency. For example, if one unit of the U.S. home consumption bundle costs 100 dollars, then the U.S. price level  $P_{t} = 100$ . Inflation is defined as the change in the price level:

$$
\pi_ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \Delta \log P _ {t}.
$$

Recall that  $c_{t}$  is the real consumption. We use  $C_{t} = P_{t}c_{t}$  to denote the nominal consumption. In the same example, if the U.S. households consume 10 units of the home consumption bundle, then the real consumption is  $c_{t} = 10$  units of the consumption bundle and the nominal consumption is  $C_{t} = 10 \times 100 = 1000$  dollars. More generally, we use uppercase letters to denote nominal prices and quantities, and we use lowercase letters to denote real prices and quantities. The nominal interest rate  $i_{t}$  and the inflation rate  $\pi_{t}$  are the exceptions to this notation, as it is common to express them in lowercase. $^{1}$

Recall that the log real exchange rate  $e_t$  measures the conversion ratio between the home and foreign countries' consumption baskets, and a higher value means that the home consumption basket is more expensive. We similarly define the nominal exchange rate  $\exp(\mathcal{E}_t)$  as the conversion ratio between the home and foreign currencies. It is related to the real exchange rate  $e_t$  and the price levels  $P_t$  and  $P_t^*$  via

$$
\exp (e _ {t}) = \exp (\mathcal {E} _ {t}) \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {t} ^ {*}}.
$$

If we fix the real exchange rate  $e_t$ , a higher home inflation  $P_t$  is associated with a lower nominal value of the home currency  $\mathcal{E}_t$ .

Finally, we use the nominal SDF to discount nominal returns and nominal cash flows. The home nominal SDF  $M_{t+1}$  is defined as

$$
M _ {t + 1} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} m _ {t + 1} - \pi_ {t + 1}. \tag {6.1}
$$

In our derivation, we will also use the lower case  $p_t(h)$  to denote the price of a specific variety of goods, which helps to distinguish it from the aggregate price index  $P_t$ .

If an asset with real return  $\tilde{r}_{t+1}$ , its nominal return is  $\tilde{r}_{t+1} + \pi_{t+1}$ . We can price this asset either by

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + \tilde {r} _ {t + 1}) ],
$$

or equivalently by

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t + 1} + \tilde {r} _ {t + 1} + \pi_ {t + 1}) ].
$$

# 6.A.1 Exchange Rate Accounting

Next, let us relate these concepts to the exchange rate accounting exercises in Section 1.B and 4.B. Starting from the Euler equation for the nominal bond return, we have

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1} + i _ {t}\right) \right],
$$

which implies

$$
\exp (- i _ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t + 1}) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - \pi_ {t + 1}\right) \right].
$$

Assuming joint normality, we can express the nominal interest rate as

$$
\begin{array}{l} i _ {t} = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ m _ {t + 1} \right] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}\right) + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \pi_ {t + 1} \right] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\pi_ {t + 1}\right) + c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, \pi_ {t + 1}\right) \\ = r _ {t} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \pi_ {t + 1} \right] + i r p _ {t}, \tag {6.2} \\ \end{array}
$$

where

$$
i r p _ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, \pi_ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\pi_ {t + 1}\right)
$$

denotes the inflation risk premium. This expression shows that the nominal interest rate  $i_t$  can be decomposed into the real interest rate  $r_t$ , the expected inflation rate  $\mathbb{E}_t[\pi_{t+1}]$ , and the inflation risk premium  $irp_t$ .

Define the nominal currency excess return as

$$
R X _ {t + 1} = \Delta \mathcal {E} _ {t + 1} + i _ {t} - i _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

Then, we obtain the nominal version of Proposition 1.1, which states that, in the absence of bond convenience yields, the home currency's expected nominal excess return is determined by its risk premium captured by its covariance with the SDF plus a Jensen's term.

Proposition 6.1. The home currency's expected log excess return is determined by the covariance between the log foreign SDF and log exchange rate movement minus a Jensen's term:

$$
R P _ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ R X _ {t + 1} ] = - c o v _ {t} (M _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta \mathcal {E} _ {t + 1}) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta \mathcal {E} _ {t + 1}).
$$

However, I hesitate to generalize the real exchange rate decomposition in Proposition 1.2 to the nominal case, because it relies on exchange rate stationarity. Specifically, assuming that the nominal exchange rate is stationary, we can express its level as

$$
\mathcal {E} _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ i _ {t + j} - i _ {t + j} ^ {*} \right] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ R P _ {t + j} \right] + \bar {\mathcal {E}}. \tag {6.3}
$$

What prevents this formula from describing a realistic situation is that the price level is usually considered to be non-stationary. For example, suppose the real exchange rate and the foreign inflation are fixed, and the U.S. experiences a persistent increase in inflation, which raises the price level  $P_{t}$  today and increases the expected future inflation. Holding the real rate constant, the latter effect also raises the U.S. nominal interest rate  $i_{t+j}$  in the future. Then, from  $\exp(e_{t}) = \exp(\mathcal{E}_{t})P_{t} / P_{t}^{*}$ , we should expect the home inflation to depreciate the home currency in nominal terms, i.e.,  $\mathcal{E}_{t}$  declines. On the other hand, Eq. (6.3) implies that a higher expected path of the home nominal interest rate  $i_{t+j}$  should imply a stronger home currency in nominal terms, i.e.,  $\mathcal{E}_{t}$  increases, which leads to a contradiction.

The reason we obtain this contradiction is that Eq. (6.3) requires the price level differential to be stationary. If the home price level increases today, it has to decline in the future, so that the home currency's nominal depreciation implied from  $\exp(e_t) = \exp(\mathcal{E}_t)P_t / P_t^*$  and a higher  $P_t$  is consistent with lower expected home nominal interest rates  $i_{t+j}$  due to lower expected inflation.

# 6.B Model Set-Up

We consider a two-country model that incorporates firm mark-up and sticky prices. Most ingredients in the model including the monetary setting follow Corsetti and Pesenti [2007], and the fiscal part follows Jiang [2022]. This model is a simpler variant of the New Keynesian/DSGE models.

In this section, we will first characterize the model under flexible prices, which generates the results that are similar to the model developed in Section 1.A. In the next section, we will characterize the model under sticky prices and explore its implications.

# 6.B.1 Households

There are two countries, home and foreign. Each country contains a unit mass of households, a unit mass of firms, and a government. Home households are indexed by  $j \in [0,1]$ , and home firms are indexed by  $h \in [0,1]$ . Foreign households are indexed by  $j^{*} \in [0,1]$

and foreign firms are indexed by  $f \in [0,1]$ . Each firm produces a unique variety of good, which is an imperfect substitute for other varieties.

The lifetime expected utility of home household  $j$  is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} u _ {t} (j) \stackrel {{\mathrm {d e f}}} {{=}} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(\log c _ {t} (j) - \kappa \frac {\ell_ {t} (j) ^ {1 + \nu}}{1 + \nu}\right),
$$

where  $\ell_t(j)$  is the labor effort, and  $\nu > 0$  is the labor curvature coefficient.  $c_t(j)$  is the consumption composed of a Cobb-Douglas basket of home and foreign bundles:

$$
c _ {t} (j) = c _ {H, t} (j) ^ {\alpha} c _ {F, t} (j) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

and  $c_{H,t}(j)$  and  $c_{F,t}(j)$  are constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) bundles of home and foreign varieties:

$$
c _ {H, t} (j) = \left(\int_ {0} ^ {1} c _ {t} (h, j) ^ {1 - 1 / \rho} d h\right) ^ {1 / (1 - 1 / \rho)}, \qquad c _ {F, t} (j) = \left(\int_ {0} ^ {1} c _ {t} (f, j) ^ {1 - 1 / \rho} d f\right) ^ {1 / (1 - 1 / \rho)}.
$$

The parameter  $\alpha > 1/2$  measures home bias in consumption, and the parameter  $\rho$  is the elasticity of substitution across varieties.

Let  $p_t(h)$  and  $p_t(f)$  denote the home-currency prices of varieties  $h$  and  $f$ . Let  $P_{H,t}$  and  $P_{F,t}$  denote the home-currency prices of the home and foreign bundles  $c_{H,t}(j)$  and  $c_{F,t}(j)$ , which can be shown to be the CES indices with elasticity  $1 / \rho$ :

$$
P _ {H, t} = \left(\int_ {0} ^ {1} p _ {t} (h) ^ {1 - \rho} d h\right) ^ {1 / (1 - \rho)}, \quad P _ {F, t} = \left(\int_ {0} ^ {1} p _ {t} (f) ^ {1 - \rho} d f\right) ^ {1 / (1 - \rho)}.
$$

Similarly, let  $P_{t}$  denote the home-currency price of the aggregate consumption basket in the home country. This utility-based CPI can be expressed as

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} P _ {H, t} ^ {\alpha} P _ {F, t} ^ {1 - \alpha}.
$$

Moreover, the solution of the within-period problem is similar to that in Section 1.A. The home household makes the following choices for different goods:

$$
c _ {t} (h, j) = \left(\frac {p _ {t} (h)}{P _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {- \rho} c _ {H, t}, \quad c _ {t} (f, j) = \left(\frac {p _ {t} (f)}{P _ {F , t}}\right) ^ {- \rho} c _ {F, t},
$$

and

$$
c _ {H, t} = \alpha \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {H , t}} c _ {t}, \quad c _ {F, t} = (1 - \alpha) \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {F , t}} c _ {t}.
$$

Having specified the household preferences and the within-period solution, we now turn to the households' budget constraint and their

intertemporal solution. Home household  $j$  owns the portfolio of home firms and provides labor to the firms. It earns a nominal wage  $W_{t}$  and receives a nominal dividend  $D_{t}(j)$  from the firms. It also pays tax  $\tau_{t}(j)$  to the government and purchases consumption  $c_{t}(j)$ , both denoted in real terms.

The financial markets are complete. Let  $\sigma_{t}$  denote the state of the economy at time  $t$ . Let  $\Theta (\sigma_{t + 1}|\sigma_t)$  denote the time- $t$  home-currency price for one unit of home currency delivered at time  $t + 1$  contingent on the state being  $\sigma_{t + 1}$ . At time  $t$ , home household  $j$  holds  $\Omega_{t}(\sigma_{t + 1},j)$  unit of the Arrow-Debreu security that pays off in state  $\sigma_{t + 1}$ .  $\Theta^{*}(\sigma_{t + 1}|\sigma_{t})$  is similarly defined as the time- $t$  foreign-currency price for one unit of foreign currency delivered at time  $t + 1$  contingent on the state being  $\sigma_{t + 1}$ , and  $\Omega_{t}^{*}(\sigma_{t + 1},j)$  is the quantity of this security held by home household  $j$ .

Let  $\exp(\mathcal{E}_t)$  denote the nominal exchange rate, in the unit of foreign currency per home currency. A higher nominal exchange rate means a stronger foreign currency. Then, the individual household's budget constraint at time  $t$  and state  $\sigma_t$  is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {\sigma_ {t + 1}} \Omega_ {t} (\sigma_ {t + 1}, j) \Theta (\sigma_ {t + 1} | \sigma_ {t}) + \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) \sum_ {\sigma_ {t + 1}} \Omega_ {t} ^ {*} (\sigma_ {t + 1}, j) \Theta^ {*} (\sigma_ {t + 1} | \sigma_ {t}) \\ \leq W _ {t} \ell_ {t} (j) + D _ {t} (j) - P _ {t} \tau_ {t} (j) - P _ {t} c _ {t} (j) + \Omega_ {t - 1} (\sigma_ {t}, j) + \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) \Omega_ {t - 1} ^ {*} (\sigma_ {t}, j). \\ \end{array}
$$

The home household's Lagrangian is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {L} (j) = \max  \mathbb {E} _ {0} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(\log c _ {t} (j) - \kappa \frac {\ell_ {t} (j) ^ {1 + \nu}}{1 + \nu}\right) \\ - \mathbb {E} _ {0} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \zeta_ {t} (j) \left\{\sum_ {\sigma_ {t + 1}} \Omega_ {t} \left(\sigma_ {t + 1}, j\right) \Theta \left(\sigma_ {t + 1} \mid \sigma_ {t}\right) + \exp \left(- \mathcal {E} _ {t}\right) \sum_ {\sigma_ {t + 1}} \Omega_ {t} ^ {*} \left(\sigma_ {t + 1}, j\right) \Theta^ {*} \left(\sigma_ {t + 1} \mid \sigma_ {t}\right) \right. \\ \left. - W _ {t} \ell_ {t} (j) - D _ {t} (j) + P _ {t} \tau_ {t} (j) + P _ {t} c _ {t} (j) - \Omega_ {t - 1} (\sigma_ {t}, j) - \exp \left(- \mathcal {E} _ {t}\right) \Omega_ {t - 1} ^ {*} (\sigma_ {t}, j) \right\} \\ \end{array}
$$

The first-order conditions imply

$$
\zeta_ {t} (j) = \frac {1}{P _ {t} c _ {t} (j)},
$$

$$
\Theta (\sigma_ {t + 1} | \sigma_ {t}) = \delta \mathbb {P} (\sigma_ {t + 1} | \sigma_ {t}) \frac {P _ {t} c _ {t} (j)}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1} (j)},
$$

$$
\kappa \ell_ {t} (j) ^ {\nu} P _ {t} c _ {t} (j) = W _ {t}.
$$

We define the home country's nominal SDF as

$$
\exp \left(M _ {t + 1}\right) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \delta \frac {P _ {t} c _ {t} (j)}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1} (j)},
$$

which is related to its real SDF via

$$
\exp (m _ {t + 1}) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \delta \frac {c _ {t}}{c _ {t + 1}} = \exp (M _ {t + 1} + \pi_ {t + 1}).
$$

Since the markets are complete, we can show that the nominal exchange rate movement equals the ratio between the two countries' nominal SDFs:

$$
\exp (M _ {t + 1}) = \exp \left(M _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \mathcal {E} _ {t} + \mathcal {E} _ {t + 1}\right),
$$

$$
\frac {P _ {t} c _ {t} (j)}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1} (j)} = \frac {\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t})}{\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t + 1})} \frac {P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} (j ^ {*})}{P _ {t + 1} ^ {*} c _ {t + 1} ^ {*} (j ^ {*})}.
$$

To keep the algebra simple, we assume the initial nominal exchange rate level is pinned down by  $P_0c_0(j) = \exp(-\mathcal{E}_0)P_0^*c_0^*(j)$  at time 0. Since the market is complete, this assumption amounts to taking a stance on the two countries' wealth distribution at time 0. Then, the nominal exchange rate satisfies

$$
P _ {t} c _ {t} (j) = \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} (j ^ {*})
$$

for all time  $t$ .

In this way, we recover the complete-market solution of the exchange rate movement in nominal terms:

$$
\Delta \mathcal {E} _ {t + 1} = M _ {t + 1} - M _ {t + 1} ^ {*}
$$

By symmetry, all households in each country have the same consumption, saving, and labor decisions. Therefore, we can drop their indices  $j$  and  $j^*$ .

# 6.B.2 Firms

Each home firm produces a variety  $h$  using labor supplied by home households. The production technology is linear in labor input:

$$
y _ {t} (h) = z _ {t} \ell_ {t} (h),
$$

where  $y_{t}(h)$  is the output of firm  $h$ ,  $\ell_t(h)$  is the labor input, and  $z_{t}$  is a productivity process common to all home firms. To produce  $y_{t}(h)$  units of goods, firm  $h$  faces a wage cost of  $W_{t}\ell_{t}(h)$ . Similarly, the foreign firm has a production function linear in labor input with productivity  $z_{t}^{*}$ .

Aggregating across home and foreign households, we obtain the total demand for variety  $h$ :

$$
y _ {t} (h) = \int_ {0} ^ {1} c _ {t} (h, j) d j + \int_ {0} ^ {1} c _ {t} ^ {*} (h, j) d j.
$$

The firm's nominal dividend is

$$
D _ {t} (h) = p _ {t} (h) \int_ {0} ^ {1} c _ {t} (h, j) d j + \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) p _ {t} ^ {*} (h) \int_ {0} ^ {1} c _ {t} ^ {*} (h, j) d j - W _ {t} \ell_ {t} (h).
$$

The firm's objective function is to maximize the present value of this dividend stream. Let  $MC_{t}$  denote the nominal marginal cost:

$$
M C _ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {W _ {t}}{z _ {t}}.
$$

Then, plugging in the solution from the households' within-period problem, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} D _ {t} (h) = \left(p _ {t} (h) - M C _ {t}\right) \left(\frac {p _ {t} (h)}{P _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {- \rho} c _ {H, t} \tag {6.4} \\ + \left(\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) p _ {t} ^ {*} (h) - M C _ {t}\right) \left(\frac {p _ {t} ^ {*} (h)}{P _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \rho} c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, \\ \end{array}
$$

which means that the firm's profit is equal to the profit margin times the quantity of goods sold in both countries. Since the firms produce unique goods varieties that are imperfect substitutes, the profit margin and the profit are nonzero.

# 6.B.3 Fiscal Policy

We assume that each country's fiscal authority controls its government tax and spending processes. For tractability, we make the following simplifying assumptions. First, tax and spending fall on the same basket of goods as the households' consumption, which is an aggregate of both home and foreign varieties. For the home government, let  $\tau_{t}$  denote its tax revenue and let  $g_{t}$  denote its spending in real terms.

Second, government spending is not remitted back to domestic households. As will be shown in the next section, under this assumption and flexible prices, government spending reduces the available goods for household consumption and behaves like a positive demand shock in Section 3.C. This standard mechanism will be contrasted with the new effects generated by the intertemporal government budget condition and sticky prices.

Third, governments only issue one-period debt in local currency units. The government debt does not default on its notional value, but its real value can vary due to inflation. It is therefore equivalent to a claim that pays off one unit of local currency in every state. Let  $Q_{t+1}$  denote the quantity of outstanding home government debt that is issued at time  $t$  and due at time  $t+1$ . Let  $i_t$  denote the home nominal interest rate. The government budget condition in nominal terms is

$$
Q _ {t} + P _ {t} g _ {t} = P _ {t} \tau_ {t} + Q _ {t + 1} \exp (- i _ {t}). \tag {6.5}
$$

Let  $s_t \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \tau_t - g_t$  denote the home real government surplus. Similarly, let  $s_t^* \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \tau_t^* - g_t^*$  denote the foreign real government surplus.

Iterate forward the Home government's intertemporal budget condition,

$$
\frac {Q _ {t}}{P _ {t}} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t, t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right] + \lim  _ {T \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t, t + T}) \frac {Q _ {t + T}}{P _ {t + T}} \right].
$$

The transversality condition requires that the terminal value in the intertemporal budget condition vanishes:

$$
\lim  _ {T \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t, t + T}) \frac {Q _ {t + T}}{P _ {t + T}} \right] = 0,
$$

which is equivalent to requiring that the present value of government surpluses grows slower than the real discount rate:

$$
\lim _ {T \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t, t + T}) \left(\sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t + T, t + T + k}) s _ {t + T + k}\right) \right] = 0.
$$

We will further discuss this transversality condition in Section 8.C.

Under this transversality condition, the government's intertemporal budget condition becomes

$$
\frac {Q _ {t}}{P _ {t}} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(m _ {t, t + k}\right) s _ {t + k} \right]. \tag {6.6}
$$

This equation states that the real value of government debt is equal to the real present value of government surpluses. In particular, if  $Q_{t} / P_{t}$  is greater than or smaller than the present value of government surpluses, an arbitrage opportunity will exist.

# 6.B.4 Monetary Policy

We assume that each country's monetary authority controls its local one-period nominal interest rate  $i_t$ . The monetary authority usually refers to the central bank. Usually, the nominal interest rate is set according to a Taylor rule.

From the intertemporal Euler equation,

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t + 1}) \exp (i _ {t}) ] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1}) \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {t + 1}} \exp (i _ {t}) \right] \\ \exp (- i _ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1}) \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {t + 1}} \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

the nominal interest rate  $i_t$  pins down the expected inflation under the risk-neutral expectation. A higher nominal interest rate generates a higher expected inflation.

How does the monetary authority implement this interest rate target? Recall Eq. (6.5), reproduced below,

$$
Q _ {t} + P _ {t} g _ {t} = P _ {t} \tau_ {t} + Q _ {t + 1} \exp (- i _ {t}).
$$

When the monetary authority raises the nominal interest rate  $i_{t}$ , if the fiscal policy  $(\tau_{t}, g_{t})$  and the current price level  $(P_{t})$  remain the same, then, the government has to issue a higher nominal amount of debt  $Q_{t+1}$ . This higher nominal amount of debt then raises the price level  $P_{t+1}$  in the next period via

$$
\frac {Q _ {t + 1}}{P _ {t + 1}} = \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t + 1, t + 1 + k}) s _ {t + 1 + k} \right].
$$

Equivalently, let  $q_{t} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} Q_{t} / P_{t}$  and recall  $\pi_{t} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \Delta \log P_{t}$ . Then, we can express the government budget condition Eq. (6.5) in real terms as

$$
q _ {t} + g _ {t} = \tau_ {t} + q _ {t + 1} \exp \left(\pi_ {t + 1} - i _ {t}\right).
$$

If the government commits to the same  $\tau_{t}, g_{t}$  and real quantity of debt  $q_{t+1}$ , then, a higher  $i_{t}$  triggers a higher inflation  $\pi_{t+1}$  in the next period.

When prices are sticky, the interest rate policy generates real effects, as we discuss in Section 6.D.

# 6.B.5 Market Clearing Conditions

The market clearing condition for the home consumption good is

$$
y _ {t} = \alpha \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {H , t}} \left(c _ {t} + g _ {t}\right) + (1 - \alpha) \frac {P _ {t} ^ {*}}{P _ {H , t} ^ {*}} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*} + g _ {t} ^ {*}\right). \tag {6.7}
$$

The market clearing condition for the home government bond is

$$
\int_ {0} ^ {1} \Omega_ {t} \left(\sigma_ {t + 1}, j\right) d j + \int_ {0} ^ {1} \Omega_ {t} \left(\sigma_ {t + 1}, j ^ {*}\right) d j ^ {*} = Q _ {t + 1}, \quad \forall \sigma_ {t + 1}. \tag {6.8}
$$

Note that  $Q_{t + 1}$  denotes the quantity of the home government debt that is due at time  $t + 1$ . The market clearing condition (6.8) requires that the total amount of home currency that both countries' households receive from their holdings of Arrow-Debreu securities in state  $\sigma_{t + 1}$  is equal to the amount of nominal debt the home government pays back at time  $t + 1$ .

# 6.B.6 Macro Synthesis

The exogenous variables include the productivity levels, the interest rates, and the government surpluses:

$$
\left(z _ {t}, z _ {t} ^ {*}, i _ {t}, i _ {t} ^ {*}, s _ {t}, s _ {t} ^ {*}\right) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty},
$$

which are assumed to be stochastic and i.i.d. For simplicity, we use  $\log \bar{z} = 0$  to denote the mean of the log productivity  $\log z_{t}$  and  $\log z_{t}^{*}$ .

There are 17 endogenous variables in each period  $t$ :

$$
(c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}, c _ {t}, P _ {H, t}, P _ {F, t}, P _ {t}, W _ {t}, \ell_ {t}, c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}, c _ {t} ^ {*}, P _ {H, t} ^ {*}, P _ {F, t} ^ {*}, P _ {t} ^ {*}, W _ {t} ^ {*}, \ell_ {t} ^ {*}, \mathcal {E} _ {t}) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty},
$$

and we have the following 17 equations, including 5 for the home country,

$$
\kappa P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} = W _ {t},
$$

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} P _ {H, t} ^ {\alpha} P _ {F, t} ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

$$
P _ {H, t} c _ {H, t} = \alpha P _ {t} c _ {t},
$$

$$
P _ {F, t} c _ {F, t} = (1 - \alpha) P _ {t} c _ {t},
$$

$$
z _ {t} \ell_ {t} = \alpha \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {H , t}} (c _ {t} + g _ {t}) + (1 - \alpha) \frac {P _ {t} ^ {*}}{P _ {H , t} ^ {*}} (c _ {t} ^ {*} + g _ {t} ^ {*}),
$$

5 for the foreign country,

$$
\kappa P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} \left(\ell_ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {\nu} = W _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
P _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} (P _ {F, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha} (P _ {H, t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

$$
P _ {H, t} ^ {*} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = (1 - \alpha) P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
P _ {F, t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = \alpha P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
z _ {t} ^ {*} \ell_ {t} ^ {*} = (1 - \alpha) \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {F , t}} (c _ {t} + g _ {t}) + \alpha \frac {P _ {t} ^ {*}}{P _ {F , t} ^ {*}} (c _ {t} ^ {*} + g _ {t} ^ {*}).
$$

2 equations relating the price levels to the government surpluses

$$
\frac {1}{P _ {t}} = \frac {1}{Q _ {t}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {k} \frac {c _ {t}}{c _ {t + k}} s _ {t + k} \right], \tag {6.9}
$$

$$
\frac {1}{P _ {t} ^ {*}} = \frac {1}{Q _ {t} ^ {*}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {k} \frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t + k} ^ {*}} s _ {t + k} ^ {*} \right], \tag {6.10}
$$

and 1 equation for the nominal exchange rate,

$$
P _ {t} c _ {t} = \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

There are 4 additional equations governing the law of motion for prices, which depend on the firms' price-setting strategies. They are Eq. (6.11) and Eq. (6.12) for the case of flexible prices that we will consider in Section 6.C, and Eq. (6.13) and Eq. (6.14) for the case of sticky prices that we will consider in Section 6.D.

# 6.C Characterizations under Flexible Prices

# 6.C.1 Optimal Price-Setting

We consider the economy under flexible prices as a useful benchmark. In this case, the firms maximize their dividends period by

period. Take a home firm  $h$  as an example,

$$
\max_{\substack{p_{t}(h),p_{t}^{*}(h)}}D_{t}(h),
$$

where the firm dividend  $D_{t}(h)$  is given by Eq. (6.4). The solution is

$$
p _ {t} (h) = \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) p _ {t} ^ {*} (h) = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} M C _ {t},
$$

which implies that the firm sets the same price in the home and foreign markets, and the price is equal to a constant  $\rho / (\rho - 1)$  times the marginal cost  $MC_{t}$ . If we define the mark-up as the ratio between the price and the marginal cost, the mark-up is a constant in this case. This is a standard result in the oligopoly problem whenever the substitution pattern is modeled by the CES aggregator.

Then, the model is closed by the following equations for prices:

$$
P _ {H, t} = \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) P _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} M C _ {t}, \tag {6.11}
$$

$$
P _ {F, t} ^ {*} = \exp (\mathcal {E} _ {t}) P _ {F, t} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} M C _ {t} ^ {*}. \tag {6.12}
$$

Moreover, at the aggregate level, the price level satisfies

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} M C _ {t},
$$

which implies that the aggregate price level is always set at the markup multiplier times the nominal marginal cost.

# 6.C.2 Equilibrium Consumption and Exchange Rate when  $\nu = 0$

We first consider a simplification of the model by setting  $\nu = 0$ . In this case, the disutility from work is linear in the labor provided:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} u _ {t} (j) \stackrel {{\mathrm {d e f}}} {{=}} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(\log c _ {t} (j) - \kappa \ell_ {t} (j)\right).
$$

As we will see below, this simplifying assumption implies that labor adjusts fully in response to government spending shocks. Let  $\bar{\ell} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} (\rho - 1) / (\rho \kappa)$  denote the natural rate of employment, which prevails in an economy without nominal rigidities and government spending. The following result characterizes the equilibrium allocation and exchange rate in the model.

Proposition 6.2. If  $\nu = 0$ , the equilibrium labor is

$$
\ell_ {t} = \bar {\ell} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right), \qquad \ell_ {t} ^ {*} = \bar {\ell} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}}\right),
$$

the equilibrium consumption is

$$
\log c _ {t} - \log \bar {c} = \alpha \log z _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) \log z _ {t} ^ {*}, \quad \log c _ {t} ^ {*} - \log \bar {c} = \alpha \log z _ {t} ^ {*} + (1 - \alpha) \log z _ {t},
$$

the equilibrium real exchange rate is

$$
e _ {t} = - \log c _ {t} + \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = - (2 \alpha - 1) (\log z _ {t} - \log z _ {t} ^ {*}),
$$

the equilibrium price level is

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {Q _ {t}}{\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t , t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right]}, \qquad P _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {Q _ {t} ^ {*}}{\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t , t + k} ^ {*}) s _ {t + k} ^ {*} \right]},
$$

and the (risk-neutral) expected inflation satisfies

$$
\exp (- i _ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1}) \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {t + 1}} \right].
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.24. This proposition shows that, if  $\nu = 0$  and prices are flexible, neither monetary nor fiscal policies affect the equilibrium consumption or the real exchange rate; the price level adjusts to fully absorb the monetary and fiscal shocks. To be more precise, consumption is only determined by the stochastic productivity levels  $z_{t}$  and  $z_{t}^{*}$ . Due to home bias (i.e.,  $\alpha > 1/2$ ), the home households' consumption is more sensitive to the home productivity level and the foreign households' consumption is more sensitive to the foreign productivity level. This result is similar to the result we obtained in the complete-market endowment economy in Section 1.C, which implies that consumption is a linear combination of home and foreign endowments.

In terms of the monetary policy, this proposition shows that a higher nominal interest rate  $i_{t}$  leads to a higher expected inflation  $\pi_{t+1}$ , but it does not affect the real rate  $r_{t}$ , since the real rate only depends on the consumption dynamics:

$$
\exp (- r _ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t + 1}) ] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {c _ {t}}{c _ {t + 1}} \right].
$$

In terms of the fiscal policy, this proposition shows that neither tax  $\tau_{t}$  nor spending  $g_{t}$  affect consumption. For given productivity levels, a higher real government spending  $g_{t}$  incentivizes the households to work more and produce just enough goods to fund the government spending, while keeping their consumption level constant. A higher real tax  $\tau_{t}$ , on the other hand, does not affect the equilibrium labor and output—that is, whether the government chooses to fund its spending by raising tax or issuing new debt is irrelevant to real allocations. Both tax and spending do affect the price level, via the intertemporal government budget condition Eq. (6.6):

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {Q _ {t}}{\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t , t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right]}.
$$

In particular, a higher tax or a lower spending leads to a higher government surplus, which lowers the price level.

Finally, the real exchange rate is determined by the equilibrium consumption, which only depends on the productivity level. Therefore, this model with flexible prices gives rise to a clear distinction between the real variables (i.e., consumption, real exchange rate) that only depends on productivity shocks and the nominal variable (i.e., price level, nominal exchange rate) that also depend on the monetary and policy shocks. In the next section, we will see how this distinction dissolves when prices are sticky.

# 6.C.3 Equilibrium Consumption and Exchange Rate in the General Case

Now, we consider the general case with  $\nu > 0$ . The following result characterizes the equilibrium allocation, exchange rate, and price level in the model.

Proposition 6.3. For a general  $\nu$ , the equilibrium labor is

$$
\ell_ {t} = \bar {\ell} ^ {\frac {1}{1 + \nu}} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{1 + \nu}}, \qquad \ell_ {t} ^ {*} = \bar {\ell} ^ {\frac {1}{1 + \nu}} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{1 + \nu}},
$$

the equilibrium consumption is

$$
\log c _ {t} - \log \bar {c} = \alpha \log z _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) \log z _ {t} ^ {*} - \frac {\nu}{1 + \nu} \left((\alpha^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2}) \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + 2 (1 - \alpha) \alpha \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right),
$$

$$
\log c _ {t} ^ {*} - \log \bar {c} = \alpha \log z _ {t} ^ {*} + (1 - \alpha) \log z _ {t} - \frac {\nu}{1 + \nu} \left((\alpha^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2}) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}} + 2 (1 - \alpha) \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}}\right),
$$

the equilibrium foreign real exchange rate is

$$
e _ {t} = - \log c _ {t} + \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = - (2 \alpha - 1) (\log z _ {t} - \log z _ {t} ^ {*}) + \frac {\nu}{1 + \nu} (2 \alpha - 1) ^ {2} \left(\frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} - \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right),
$$

the equilibrium price level is

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {Q _ {t}}{\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t , t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right]}, \qquad P _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {Q _ {t} ^ {*}}{\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t , t + k} ^ {*}) s _ {t + k} ^ {*} \right]}
$$

and the (risk-neutral) expected inflation satisfies

$$
\exp (- i _ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1}) \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {t + 1}} \right].
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.24. This proposition shows that the real consumption and the real exchange rate depend on not only the productivity shocks  $z_{t}$  and  $z_{t}^{*}$ , but also government spending-to-consumption ratios  $g_{t} / c_{t}$  and  $g_{t}^{*} / c_{t}^{*}$ . As such, while the monetary shocks still have no effects on real variables, fiscal spending shocks do.

To understand this result, which is representative of textbook macro models, note that a positive labor curvature coefficient  $\nu$  implies that a higher labor effort drives up the real wage. Under this assumption, a higher government spending requires more labor and makes it more costly. As a result, government spending crowds out the households' private consumption and raises their marginal utility over consumption, which, by the international risk-sharing condition, also appreciates the local currency in real terms.

In this way, the flexible-price model predicts that a higher government spending leads to real depreciation of the local currency. Conversely, holding tax constant, a higher government surplus is associated with a lower government spending and hence real appreciation of the local currency. This prediction is inconsistent with the data, as countries that have worse fiscal conditions tend to have weaker currencies.

# 6.D Characterizations under Sticky Prices

# 6.D.1 Optimal Price-Setting

If prices are sticky, some or all firms cannot adjust their prices after the shocks are realized in each period. In this section, we consider a simple form of nominal rigidities: firms have to set prices one period in advance. Under this assumption, the firms' profit maximization problem only concerns one period. Take the home firm  $h$  as an example,

$$
\max  _ {p _ {t} (h), p _ {t} ^ {*} (h)} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \exp (M _ {t - 1, t}) D _ {t} (h) ].
$$

Based on information available at time  $t - 1$ , the price at home  $p_t(h)$  is set to maximize the expected profit from the home market:

$$
\max _ {p _ {t} (h)} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \exp (M _ {t - 1, t}) (p _ {t} (h) - M C _ {t}) \left(\frac {p _ {t} (h)}{P _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {- \rho} c _ {H, t} \right].
$$

The future profit is discounted by the domestic households' SDF  $\exp (M_{t - 1,t})$ , as they are the shareholders whose interests the firms maximize.

The first-order condition is

$$
0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \delta \frac {P _ {t - 1} c _ {t - 1}}{P _ {t} c _ {t}} \left((1 - \rho) p _ {t} (h) ^ {- \rho} + \rho M C _ {t} p _ {t} (h) ^ {- \rho - 1}\right) \left(\frac {1}{P _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {- \rho} \alpha \frac {P _ {t}}{P _ {H , t}} c _ {t} \right],
$$

which, under symmetry  $p_t(h) = P_{H,t}$ , implies

$$
P _ {H, t} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ M C _ {t} \right].
$$

If we compare this pricing strategy with Eq. (6.11) obtained under flexible prices, we can see that the optimal price is now set to match the expected marginal cost. This is because the firms cannot adjust their prices after the shocks are realized, and the best they can do is to be correct "on average."

The home firms also need to set their sale price in the foreign market. Our derivation below focuses on the case of Producer Currency Pricing, under which case exports are priced and invoiced in the domestic (producer's) currency. Then, the price of the home firms' production sold in the foreign country is set according to

$$
\max _ {\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) p _ {t} ^ {*} (h)} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \exp (M _ {t - 1, t}) (\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) p _ {t} ^ {*} (h) - M C _ {t}) \left(\frac {p _ {t} ^ {*} (h)}{P _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \rho} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} \right],
$$

which implies

$$
\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) P _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ M C _ {t} ].
$$

So, the entire price block can be described as

$$
P _ {H, t} = \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) P _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ M C _ {t} ], \tag {6.13}
$$

$$
P _ {F, t} ^ {*} = \exp (\mathcal {E} _ {t}) P _ {F, t} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ M C _ {t} ^ {*} \right]. \tag {6.14}
$$

In other words, under Producer Currency Pricing, the local-currency price of the local consumption bundle (e.g.,  $P_{H,t}$ ) is fixed and the local-currency price of the foreign consumption bundle (e.g.,  $P_{F,t}$ ) comoves with the exchange rate.

Alternatively, some models assume Local Currency Pricing, under which case exports are priced and invoiced in the foreign (importers') currency. Then, the price of the home firms' production sold in the foreign country is set according to

$$
\max _ {p _ {t} ^ {*} (h)} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \exp (M _ {t - 1, t}) (\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) p _ {t} ^ {*} (h) - M C _ {t}) \left(\frac {p _ {t} ^ {*} (h)}{P _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \rho} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} \right].
$$

The first order condition is

$$
0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \delta \frac {P _ {t - 1} c _ {t - 1}}{P _ {t} c _ {t}} ((1 - \rho) \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) p _ {t} (h) ^ {- \rho} + \rho M C _ {t} p _ {t} (h) ^ {- \rho - 1}) \left(\frac {1}{P _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {- \rho} \alpha \frac {P _ {t} ^ {*}}{P _ {H , t} ^ {*}} c _ {t} ^ {*} \right].
$$

Note that  $P_{t - 1}c_{t - 1} = \exp (-\mathcal{E}_t)P_{H,t}^* c_t^*$ . This implies

$$
P _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ M C _ {t} \exp (\mathcal {E} _ {t}) \right].
$$

Compared to the case of Producer Currency Pricing, in this case the exchange rate  $\mathcal{E}_t$  goes into the expectation operator, which is consistent with the assumption that the price is fixed at the consumers' (i.e.

the foreign households') currency unit. As a result, both the local-currency price of the local consumption bundle (e.g.,  $P_{H,t}$ ) and the local-currency price of the foreign consumption bundle (e.g.,  $P_{F,t}$ ) are fixed. The solution in this case is discussed in Jiang [2022].

# 6.D.2 Equilibrium Consumption and Aggregate Demand

The sticky prices imply slow adjustments in the price level. As a result, movements in the nominal exchange rate lead to movements in the real exchange rate. This idea has been central in many international macro models since the seminal work by Mundell-Fleming in the 1960s. In the context of this model, we formalize this idea by first relating the real consumption and the real exchange rate movement to the nominal shocks.

Proposition 6.4. The equilibrium consumption can be solved by

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {t} = \bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {\left(P _ {t} c _ {t}\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{\left(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} \right]\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} \left(\ell_ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} \right]\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}}, \\ c _ {t} ^ {*} = \bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {(P _ {t} c _ {t}) ^ {1 - \alpha} (P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha}}{(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ]) ^ {1 - \alpha} (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} ]) ^ {\alpha}}, \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log c _ {t} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c} + \alpha \log \left(P _ {t} c _ {t}\right) + (1 - \alpha) \log \left(P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}\right), \\ \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c _ {t} ^ {*}} + \alpha \log (P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}) + (1 - \alpha) \log (P _ {t} c _ {t}), \\ - e _ {t} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {e} + (2 \alpha - 1) \log (P _ {t} c _ {t}) - (2 \alpha - 1) \log (P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}), \\ \end{array}
$$

where the terms  $\kappa_{t - 1}^{c},\kappa_{t - 1}^{c^{*}},\kappa_{t - 1}^{e}$  are known in period  $t - 1$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.25. A useful way to understand the equilibrium outcome under sticky prices is to regard the equilibrium nominal consumption  $P_{t}c_{t}$  and  $P_{t}^{*}c_{t}^{*}$  as the aggregate demand of the home and foreign households, which directly respond to monetary and fiscal policies. In fact, this proposition shows that they are sufficient statistics for determining the real consumption and the real exchange rate.

More concretely, an expansionary monetary or fiscal policy in the home country stimulates the aggregate demand by raising the nominal household expenditure  $P_{t}c_{t}$ . As the price level is slow to adjust, this nominal shock also raises the real household expenditure  $c_{t}$ . Due to the home bias in consumption (i.e.,  $\alpha > 1/2$ ), even though complete markets facilitate full risk-sharing, this proposition shows that the home consumption  $c_{t}$  is more exposed to the home aggregate demand  $P_{t}c_{t}$ , and the foreign consumption  $c_{t}^{*}$  is more exposed to the foreign aggregate demand  $P_{t}^{*}c_{t}^{*}$ . The real exchange rate, determined

by the relative marginal utility of consumption, is also affected by the nominal household expenditures.

Next, we consider monetary and fiscal policies separately and trace out exactly how they impact the aggregate demand as summarized by the nominal household expenditures  $P_{t}c_{t}$  and  $P_{t}^{*}c_{t}^{*}$ .

# 6.D.3 Real Effects of Monetary Policy

Let us first consider the home country's monetary policy. Unlike the case of flexible prices, in which the nominal interest rate policy has no real effects, sticky prices transmit nominal interest rate shocks to real interest rates and affect the households' consumption and investment decisions. Given Eq. (6.2), reproduced below,

$$
i _ {t} = r _ {t} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \pi_ {t + 1} ] + i r p _ {t},
$$

the nominal interest rate  $i_t$  is equal to the real interest rate plus the expected inflation plus the inflation risk premium. When the prices are sticky, expected inflation and inflation risk premium do not respond fully to an increase in the nominal interest rate. As a result, the real interest rate  $r_t$  responds as well.

Specifically in our setting, the Euler equation

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t + 1} + i _ {t}) ]
$$

implies the following intertemporal relationship between the nominal interest rate and the current and future aggregate demand:

$$
\frac {1}{P _ {t} c _ {t}} = \exp \left(i _ {t}\right) \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1}} \right]. \tag {6.15}
$$

We consider the case in which the expected inverse future aggregate demand  $\mathbb{E}_t\left[\delta \frac{1}{P_{t + 1}c_{t + 1}}\right]$  is constant, which we will show is without loss of generality in this model. Then, Eq. (6.15) implies that the nominal interest rate  $i_t$  directly affects today's aggregate demand  $P_{t}c_{t}$ . If the monetary authority in the home country raises the nominal interest rate by  $1\%$ , today's aggregate demand  $P_{t}c_{t}$  will shrink by  $1\%$ . Similarly, a higher nominal interest rate in the foreign country lowers the foreign aggregate demand. Plugging in this relationship to Proposition 6.4, we obtain the following result [Corsetti and Pesenti, 2007]:

Proposition 6.5. When the monetary authorities set the nominal interest rates in home and foreign countries, the equilibrium consumption is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log c _ {t} = \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c} - \alpha i _ {t} - (1 - \alpha) i _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}} - \alpha i _ {t} ^ {*} - (1 - \alpha) i _ {t}, \\ \end{array}
$$

the equilibrium real interest rate is

$$
r _ {t} = \bar {r} + \alpha i _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) i _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

the equilibrium real exchange rate is

$$
e _ {t} = - \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c} + \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c *} + (2 \alpha - 1) (i _ {t} - i _ {t} ^ {*}),
$$

and the equilibrium price levels are

$$
\log P _ {t} = - \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c} - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1}} \right] + (1 - \alpha) \left(i _ {t} ^ {*} - i _ {t}\right).
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.26. This proposition has an intuitive interpretation. When the home country's monetary authority raises the nominal interest rate, it depresses the aggregate demand and lowers the equilibrium consumption in the home country. Due to international risk-sharing through complete markets, the consumption loads on both home and foreign nominal interest rates. That said, the effect of the home nominal interest rate on home consumption is still stronger due to the home bias in the goods market (i.e.,  $\alpha > 1/2$ ).

Moreover, since prices are sticky, a higher nominal interest rate also leads to a higher real interest rate. By the following Euler equation,

$$
r _ {t} = - \log \delta - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ c _ {t} / c _ {t + 1} \right],
$$

the real interest rate is inversely related to the expected consumption growth. So, the increase in the real interest rate is also consistent with an increase in the expected consumption growth, which is made possible by a decline in today's consumption.

Finally, as the home consumption declines when the home country's monetary authority raises the nominal interest rate, the home households' marginal utility increases and appreciates the home currency in both nominal and real terms. In this way, our model reproduces a positive relationship between the local nominal interest rate and the real strength of the currency, which goes back a long way to some of the seminal papers in the international macro literature [Mundell, 1963, Fleming, 1962, Dornbusch, 1976, Frankel, 1979].

Some readers might wonder where the productivity shocks  $z_{t}$  and  $z_{t}^{*}$  go in the equilibrium consumption and the real exchange rate. In this specific model, monetary and fiscal policies are strong enough to fully counter the effects of productivity shocks. Specifically, there exist nominal interest rates

$$
i _ {t} = - \log \delta - \left(\log z _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \log z _ {t} \right]\right),
$$

$$
i _ {t} ^ {*} = - \log \delta - (\log z _ {t} ^ {*} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \log z _ {t} ^ {*} ]),
$$

such that our sticky-price model replicates the equilibrium consumption and real exchange rate under the flexible-price case. As such, we can think of these nominal interest rates as the natural nominal rates that would prevail in the absence of monetary and fiscal policies. If the monetary authority sets the nominal interest rate above the natural rate, then, they depress the aggregate demand and lower the equilibrium consumption below the flexible-price level, and vice versa.

A similar argument can be applied to the fiscal policy, which we study in the next subsection. In more general models, monetary and fiscal policies might be less effective in fully counteracting the effects of productivity shocks, and the equilibrium consumption and the real exchange rate would depend on the productivity shocks as well.

# 6.D.4 Real Effects of Fiscal Policy

Next, let us shift our focus on the home country's fiscal policy. Given the definition of the real SDF, i.e.,  $\exp(m_{t,t+k}) = \delta^k c_t / c_{t+k}$ , it is useful to express the present value of government surpluses as the current surplus plus the sum of discounted expected future surpluses.

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t, t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right] = s _ {t} + c _ {t} \cdot \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {k} \frac {s _ {t + k}}{c _ {t + k}} \right].
$$

Note that the  $k$ -period real rate is equal to

$$
r _ {t} (k) = - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta c _ {t} / c _ {t + k} \right] = - \log \left(c _ {t} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta / c _ {t + k} \right]\right).
$$

All else equal, a higher current consumption  $c_{t}$  implies a lower real discount rate and increases the present value of future government surpluses. As a result, the present value of current and future surpluses  $\mathbb{E}_t\left[\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}\exp (m_{t,t + k})s_{t + k}\right]$  is increasing in the current consumption  $c_{t}$ .

For tractability, we consider the simple case in which future consumption and surpluses are i.i.d. Then,  $\mathbb{E}_t\left[\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\delta_k^{\frac{s_{t+k}}{c_{t+k}}}\right]$  is equal to a constant that we denote by  $A$ , which allows us to simplify Eq. (6.6) and express the home country's nominal aggregate demand as

$$
P _ {t} c _ {t} = \frac {Q _ {t} c _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}. \tag {6.16}
$$

Likewise, we define  $A^{*} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \delta^{k} \frac{s_{t+k}^{*}}{c_{t+k}^{*}}\right]$ , and express the foreign country's nominal aggregate demand as

$$
P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {Q _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}}. \tag {6.17}
$$

Plug the expressions (6.16) and (6.17) for the aggregate demand into Proposition 6.4, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log c _ {t} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c} + \alpha \log \left(\frac {c _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}\right) + (1 - \alpha) \log \left(\frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}}\right), \\ \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}} + (1 - \alpha) \log \left(\frac {c _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}\right) + \alpha \log \left(\frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

These equations allow us to solve the equilibrium consumption  $c_{t}$  and  $c_{t}^{*}$  as functions of the government surpluses  $s_{t}$  and  $s_{t}^{*}$ . For expositional convenience, in the proposition below we consider a symmetric distribution for home and foreign variables. Let  $\bar{s}$  denote both countries' mean government surplus in this distribution and let  $\bar{c}$  denote both countries' mean equilibrium consumption. Symmetry also implies  $A = A^{*}$ .

If we take a first-order approximation around  $s_t = s_t^* = \bar{s}$  and  $c_t = c_t^* = \bar{c}$ , then, we obtain a linear equation system with a simple solution [Jiang, 2022]:

Proposition 6.6. Under a first-order approximation, the equilibrium consumption is

$$
\log c _ {t} = \kappa_ {c} - \frac {\left((1 - \alpha) \bar {s} / A + \alpha \bar {c}\right)}{\bar {c} (A \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) 2 \bar {s})} s _ {t} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) (\bar {c} + \bar {s} / A)}{\bar {c} (A \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) 2 \bar {s})} s _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
\log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa_ {c} ^ {*} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) (\bar {c} + \bar {s} / A)}{\bar {c} (A \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) 2 \bar {s})} s _ {t} - \frac {\left((1 - \alpha) \bar {s} / A + \alpha \bar {c}\right)}{\bar {c} (A \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) 2 \bar {s})} s _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

the equilibrium real interest rate is

$$
r _ {t} = - \log \delta - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ 1 / c _ {t + 1} \right] - \kappa_ {c} + \frac {\left((1 - \alpha) \bar {s} / A + \alpha \bar {c}\right)}{\bar {c} (A \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) 2 \bar {s})} s _ {t} + \frac {(1 - \alpha) (\bar {c} + \bar {s} / A)}{\bar {c} (A \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) 2 \bar {s})} s _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

the equilibrium real exchange rate is

$$
e _ {t} = - \kappa_ {c} + \kappa_ {c} ^ {*} + \frac {(2 \alpha - 1) \bar {c}}{A \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) 2 \bar {s}} \left(s _ {t} - s _ {t} ^ {*}\right),
$$

and the equilibrium price levels are

$$
\log P _ {t} = \kappa^ {P} + \log Q _ {t} - \frac {1 - \alpha}{A \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s}} \left(s _ {t} - s _ {t} ^ {*}\right).
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.27. This proposition shows that the government surplus  $s_t$  also has real effects: by Eq. (6.6), reproduced below,

$$
\frac {Q _ {t}}{P _ {t}} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t, t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right] = s _ {t} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t, t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right], \tag {6.18}
$$

when the current surplus  $s_t$  increases, the present value of government surpluses on the right-hand side of this equation will increase.

However, on the left-hand side, the debt quantity  $Q_{t}$  is determined in the previous period, and the price index  $P_{t}$  is sticky. Therefore, to equilibrate this intertemporal government budget constraint, the real interest rate captured by  $m_{t,t+k}$  on the right-hand side has to rise to lower the present value of future surpluses and offset the increase in the current surplus.

In this way, a higher U.S. surplus increases the U.S. real interest rate and, by Proposition 1.2, appreciates the dollar's real exchange rate. Similar to the case with monetary shocks, to engineer the increase in the U.S. real interest rate, the U.S. consumption has to decline in this period and create an expected increase in consumption growth. As a result, a fiscal shock that increases the government surplus  $s_t$  in the home country leads to a higher home real interest rate and a stronger home currency in real terms.

We can also think about the exchange rate response to the fiscal shock from the foreign households' perspective. Using the foreign numérique, we can rewrite Eq. (6.18) as

$$
\exp (e _ {t}) \frac {Q _ {t}}{P _ {t}} = \exp (e _ {t}) s _ {t} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t, t + k} ^ {*}) \exp (e _ {t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right].
$$

Rearranging terms, we obtain

$$
\exp (e _ {t}) \left(\frac {Q _ {t}}{P _ {t}} - s _ {t}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(m _ {t, t + k} ^ {*}\right) \exp (e _ {t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right].
$$

For this thought experiment, let us assume that the home country is very small so that its fiscal shock does not affect the foreign SDF  $m_{t,t+k}^{*}$ , and that the shock is transitory so that the future surpluses  $s_{t+k}$  and the future real exchange rate  $e_{t+k}$  are unaffected. Then, to equilibrate this equation in response to an increase in the current surplus  $s_t$ , the current real exchange rate  $e_t$  has to appreciate. In this sense, the real exchange rate behaves like the asset price for the claim to government surpluses, which has to adjust when the fiscal cash flows change. We can also use this logic to show that the U.S. real exchange rate has to appreciate when the expected future surpluses  $\mathbb{E}_t[s_{t+k}]$  increase [Jiang, 2022].

Notably, this result is opposite to what we obtained under flexible prices. Specifically, Proposition 6.3 shows that, with a positive curvature parameter  $\nu$  for labor, a higher government spending in the home country  $g_{t}$ , which corresponds to a lower government surplus  $s_t$ , crowds out the local households' private consumption, increases their marginal utility, and appreciates the home currency in real terms. Sticky prices overturn this result and generate home currency depreciation through the valuation channel.

This result is also different from the Mundell-Fleming view of the fiscal policy, under which a fiscal expansion in the form of higher government spending shifts up the IS curve, puts an upward pressure on the local interest rate, attracts capital inflows, and appreciates the local currency. In comparison, imposing the intertemporal government budget constraint (6.6) as we do in our sticky-price model generates an opposite valuation effect that depreciates the local currency when the surplus declines or government spending increases.

Our model makes the extreme assumption that prices are fully sticky for one period. It is possible to extend the model to allow for a more realistic form of price stickiness. For example, if some firms' prices are sticky for multiple periods, monetary and fiscal policies could have persistent effects on the real economy.

Moreover, our model assumes that the government only issues one-period debt. If the government issues longer-term debt, as we will see in Chapter 8, the bond quantity  $Q_{t}$  on the left-hand side of Eq. (6.18) becomes the market value of the outstanding debt. Then, when the fiscal shocks impact the government surpluses on the right-hand side of this equation, the bond price can also adjust and absorb some of the shocks, so that the consumption does not need to adjust as much. However, adjustments in the long-term bond price have implications for the discount rates in the future, which also transmits the fiscal shocks to the real economy in future periods. As such, the long-term bond could lower the real response in the current period while magnifying the real responses in future periods. See Cochrane [2023] for detailed discussions.

# 6.E Comparing Monetary and Fiscal Policies

# 6.E.1 Observational Equivalence

Eq. (6.15) can be expressed as

$$
\frac {s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}{Q _ {t} c _ {t}} = \exp (i _ {t}) \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {s _ {t + 1} + c _ {t + 1} A}{Q _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1}} \right].
$$

Note that the nominal quantity of government debt  $Q_{t + 1}$  is chosen by the government in period  $t$ , so it is known in period  $t$ . Then, we can express the home nominal interest rate as

$$
i _ {t} = \log \left(\frac {s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}{c _ {t}}\right) - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {s _ {t + 1} + c _ {t + 1} A}{c _ {t + 1}} \right] + \Delta \log Q _ {t + 1}. \tag {6.19}
$$

Since the consumption and government surplus shocks are i.i.d. across periods,  $\mathbb{E}_t\left[\delta \frac{s_{t + 1} + c_{t + 1}A}{c_{t + 1}}\right]$  is a constant. Then, for any given nominal debt growth  $Q_{t + 1} / Q_t$ , the nominal interest rate  $i_t$  directly affects the real consumption  $c_t$ .

Similarly, we can express the foreign nominal interest rate as

$$
i _ {t} ^ {*} = \log \left(\frac {s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {s _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + c _ {t + 1} ^ {*} A ^ {*}}{c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}} \right] + \Delta \log Q _ {t + 1} ^ {*}.
$$

Along with

$$
\log c _ {t} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c} + \alpha \log \left(\frac {c _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}\right) + (1 - \alpha) \log \left(\frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}}\right),
$$

$$
\log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}} + (1 - \alpha) \log \left(\frac {c _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}\right) + \alpha \log \left(\frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}}\right),
$$

we obtain 4 equations with 6 unknowns: the nominal interest rates  $i_{t}$  and  $i_{t}^{*}$ , the government surpluses  $s_{t}$  and  $s_{t}^{*}$ , and the equilibrium consumption  $c_{t}$  and  $c_{t}^{*}$ . So, the monetary policies which set the nominal interest rates and the fiscal policies which set the government surpluses cannot both be exogenous. If they are, then we have 4 equations with only 2 endogenous variables, which makes the equation system overidentified and there might be no equilibrium.

For example, in our discussion of the monetary policy above, the nominal interest rate policy will determine both the equilibrium consumption and the government surpluses that the fiscal authority needs to accommodate. In this case, the monetary authority sets the price level and the aggregate demand, and the fiscal authority implements the corresponding taxation and spending to ensure the government budget constraint is satisfied.

Conversely, in our discussion of the fiscal policy above, the government surplus policy will determine both the equilibrium consumption and the nominal interest rates that the monetary authority needs to accommodate. In this case, the fiscal authority sets the price level and the aggregate demand, and the monetary authority implements the corresponding nominal interest rate to ensure the government budget constraint is satisfied.

Another way to frame this result is to note that the observed macroeconomic data can be mapped to either a model in which the monetary policies are active and determines the path of the nominal interest rates as well as the necessary responses in government surpluses, or a model in which the fiscal policies are active and determines the path of the government surpluses as well as the necessary responses in nominal interest rates. Cochrane [2021] offers a more detailed discussion of this observational equivalence.

Finally, throughout our discussion above, we have left out one degree of freedom, which is the growth rate of the government debt quantity  $\Delta \log Q_{t+1}$ . For given nominal interest rate  $i_t$  and real government surplus  $s_t$ , varying the nominal quantity of government debt

has no real effects. Given Eq. (6.19), reproduced below,

$$
i _ {t} = \log \left(\frac {s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}{c _ {t}}\right) - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {s _ {t + 1} + c _ {t + 1} A}{c _ {t + 1}} \right] + \Delta \log Q _ {t + 1},
$$

and given

$$
\begin{array}{l} \pi_ {t + 1} = \log Q _ {t + 1} - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t + 1, t + 1 + k}) s _ {t + 1 + k} \right] + \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t, t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right] \\ = \log Q _ {t + 1} - \log \left(s _ {t + 1} + c _ {t + 1} A\right) + \log \left(s _ {t} + c _ {t} A\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

we can see that a higher nominal government debt growth  $\Delta \log Q_{t + 1}$  leads to a higher nominal interest rate by the same magnitude. It does not affect the real consumption  $c_{t}$  and hence the real rate  $r_t$ . Rather, it moves one-to-one with the inflation  $\pi_{t + 1}$ . Since  $\Delta \log Q_{t + 1}$  is known in period  $t$ , a higher nominal debt growth creates expected inflation.

As such, we can think of the nominal quantity of government debt  $Q_{t}$  as another policy instrument separate from the nominal interest rate  $i_{t}$  and the real government surplus  $s_{t}$ . However, this additional instrument does not affect the real economy, but only affects the expected inflation. In comparison, the nominal interest rate  $i_{t}$  and the real government surplus  $s_{t}$  create surprise inflation, which is what is required to deliver real effects in this model.

# 6.E.2 Active vs. Passive Monetary and Fiscal Policies

The sticky-price model above generates a very stark result: in each period, an active monetary policy requires full cooperation from the fiscal side, and an active fiscal policy requires full cooperation from the monetary side. In other words, implementing one policy leaves no room for the other. A natural question is whether this result can be relaxed when we consider more general forms of price stickiness and government policies.

Leeper [1991] provides an answer to this question in a fairly general class of linearized models, which allows less extreme forms of price stickiness. He shows that the policy responses can be characterized by two regions: in the monetary dominance region, the monetary shock is exogenous and requires the fiscal policy to accommodate the shock; in the fiscal dominance region, the fiscal shock is exogenous and requires the monetary policy to adjust to accommodate the shock. As we relax the assumption of full price stickiness for one period, there is some space for the monetary rate to respond to inflation, and some space for the fiscal surplus to respond to the level of outstanding debt. However, a strong monetary response to inflation constrains the extent to which the fiscal authority can respond to the debt level, and vice versa.

In light of this discussion, the standard New Keynesian framework can be understood as assuming that the monetary policy is active and the fiscal authority accommodates the monetary shocks. As Leeper [2010] puts it, "most macroeconomists were raised on the belief that inflation is determined by monetary policy, especially in the long run. Full stop... Central bankers need a broader perspective on price level determination—to at least understand and acknowledge that there is another channel through which inflation can be determined. The broader perspective is important because the new Keynesian/old monetarist view implicitly embeds a dirty little secret: for monetary policy to successfully control inflation, fiscal policy must behave in a particular, circumscribed manner."

In particular, the accommodative fiscal stance can be engineered by the expectation that future government surpluses will adjust to stabilize the debt level, as opposed to requiring today's government surplus to adjust right away in response to monetary shocks. As long as the investors' and households' fiscal expectations are anchored to this expectation, inflation and, by the same argument, the real exchange rate can be understood in terms of the monetary shocks as we have seen in Proposition 6.5. However, when the agents stop believing that the fiscal authority is committed to the accommodative stance, then, its fiscal policy can undermine the ability of monetary policy to control inflation and drive real economic outcomes on its own.

# 6.E.3 Discussions

In this chapter, we have made two extreme assumptions: (1) prices are fully sticky for one period, and (2) monetary and fiscal authorities cannot trade off their policies intertemporally. In exchange, we are able to derive closed-form solutions to characterize the equilibrium responses in consumption and the exchange rate. To consider these issues quantitatively, we may need to relax these assumptions and work with numerical models. For example, we may consider a setting in which prices are only partially sticky, which gives rise to a more realistic Phillips Curve. In addition, the monetary and fiscal responses can have richer time-series patterns. Galí [2015] provides a good reference on the monetary side, and Cochrane [2023] provides a good reference on the fiscal side.

The fiscal-currency linkage can be applied to studying not only the exchange rate variations in normal times, but also currency crashes in crisis times [Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo, 2006]. Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo [2001] show that prospective fiscal deficits that drive currency crisis can be in the form of implicit bailout guarantees to failing banking systems. See Burnside, Eichenbaum, and

Rebelo [2016] for a review of the currency crisis models.

Moreover, the model in this chapter only investigates how monetary and fiscal shocks affect the real exchange rate by influencing the real interest rate. It is very likely that monetary and fiscal policies also drive variations in risk premia and convenience yields, which lead to exchange rate variations through different channels. For example, Caramp and Singh [2020] studies how the monetary policy impacts liquidity premia. Croce, Nguyen, and Schmid [2012b], Croce, Kung, Nguyen, and Schmid [2012a], Jiang [2021] study how fiscal policies affect risk premia. Chernov, Schmid, and Schneider [2020], Liu, Schmid, and Yaron [2020] study how fiscal policies affect default premia and liquidity premia.

Finally, these theoretical arguments are also relevant for understanding currency unions such as the Eurozone. In a currency union, as the nominal interest rate and the nominal exchange rate are pegged across the member countries, they can only adjust in response to union-wide monetary or fiscal shocks, but they cannot simultaneously adjust in response to country-specific shocks. As a result, the convenience yields and their cross-country variations thereof have to play an important role as the shock absorber. Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan [2020c] provide a detailed theoretical and empirical discussion.

# Understanding the Quantities and Flows

# 7

# Global Imbalances and the Exorbitant Privilege

# Summary

- The architecture of the international monetary system has important implications for exchange rate and capital flow dynamics, and reserve assets are at its cornerstone.  
- We examine two complementary views of the architecture: the insurance provision view emphasizes the U.S.' role as the world's insurance provider, and the safe asset view emphasizes the foreign demand for dollar safe assets. Both views emphasize the centrality of the U.S. in the global financial markets, but they have different implications for the U.S. external imbalances and the dollar exchange rate.  
- We will also briefly survey topics related to the stability of the international monetary system.

Starting from this chapter, we will shift our focus from the exchange rates to international portfolio positions and capital flows. For this purpose, studying the Euler equations alone is no longer sufficient, and general equilibrium models become necessary to understand the financial quantities. We will begin with the most important asymmetry in the international financial system: the U.S. vs. the rest of the world.

A prototype financial system involves households who save and consume, firms or entrepreneurs who produce, and financiers who intermediate the funds between the households and the firms. These financiers can be the banks or many types of shadow banks. They provide funds to the firms by investing in their risky projects, and they provide saving vehicles to the households by taking safe deposits. In doing so, these financiers engage in the safety, liquidity, and maturity transformations.

This summary of financial system also applies at the global level, with the U.S. playing the central role as the financier who intermediates capital flows to the rest of the world and earns a premium from the intermediation process. Other countries, playing the roles of the households and the firms, invest at and get funding from the inter-

mediary. This core-periphery structure is a key feature of the modern international monetary system.

This core-periphery structure gives rise to two salient patterns in the data: global imbalances and exorbitant privilege. We have had a discussion of these patterns in Chapter 2. In this chapter, we consider two complementary ways to model these patterns.

# 7.A The Insurance Provision View

First, we consider the insurance provision view as in Gourinchas and Rey [2007b, 2022]. We adapt their model to follow the baseline setup in Section 1. A more closely. There are two countries, home and foreign. Each country produces a unique type of good, which is endowed to the domestic households. The home households' utility function is

$$
u (c _ {t}) = \frac {1}{1 - \gamma} (c _ {t}) ^ {1 - \gamma},
$$

where the consumption  $c_{t}$  is again a Cobb-Douglas aggregation of the home and foreign goods:  $c_{t} = (c_{H,t})^{\alpha}(c_{F,t})^{1 - \alpha}$ .

We deviate from the symmetric baseline case by assuming that the foreign households are more risk-averse. Their utility function is

$$
u ^ {*} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) = \frac {1}{1 - \gamma^ {*}} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \gamma^ {*}},
$$

with  $\gamma^{*} > \gamma$ . As in Section 4, we interpret the home country as the U.S., and the foreign country as the rest of the world. This difference in risk aversion can be motivated by difference in financial developments. For example, the more developed financial sector in the U.S. may face weaker liquidity or financing constraints and thus have higher risk-taking capacity [Maggiori, 2017]. Similarly, Chien and Nakanoi [2015] develop a model with heterogeneous agents in which the U.S. has a larger mass of sophisticated traders than the foreign countries.

The macro synthesis of this model is nearly identical to the baseline model in Section 1.A with complete markets. The only difference is that the home and foreign households have different risk aversion.

# 7.A.1 Social Planner's Solution

We assume the markets are complete, which allows us to solve the equilibrium using the social planner approach. More precisely, we solve the equilibrium outcome under a social planner, who maxi-

mizes a weighted sum of the households' welfare:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(\pi u \left(c _ {t}\right) + (1 - \pi) u \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right)\right) \right].
$$

The social planner tells the home and foreign households how much to consume, subject to the resource constraints

$$
y _ {t} = c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
y _ {t} ^ {*} = c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*}.
$$

The social planner's Lagrangian is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(\pi \frac {1}{1 - \gamma} (c _ {t}) ^ {1 - \gamma} + (1 - \pi) \frac {1}{1 - \gamma^ {*}} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \gamma^ {*}} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {H, t} (y _ {t} - c _ {H, t} - c _ {H, t} ^ {*}) + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {F, t} (y _ {t} ^ {*} - c _ {F, t} - c _ {F, t} ^ {*})\right) \right],
$$

which implies the following first-order conditions

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t}: \quad \delta^ {t} \pi (c _ {t}) ^ {- \gamma} \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} \\ = \zeta_ {H, t}, \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t} ^ {*}: & \delta^ {t} (1 - \pi) (c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma^ {*}} (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {\alpha} \\ & = \zeta_ {H, t}, \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t}: & \delta^ {t} \pi (c _ {t}) ^ {- \gamma} (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {H , t}}{c _ {F , t}}\right) ^ {\alpha} \\ & = \zeta_ {F, t}, \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t} ^ {*}: \quad \delta^ {t} (1 - \pi) (c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma^ {*}} \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} \\ = \zeta_ {F, t}. \end{array}
$$

Let  $tot_{t} = e_{t} / (2\alpha - 1)$  denote the log terms of trade as defined in Section 1.A. Then, we can follow the derivation in Section 1.3 and obtain the following equation system that pins down the equilibrium allocations and exchange rate.

Proposition 7.1. The equilibrium is pinned down by the following simultaneous equations

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {\alpha - 1} c _ {t} + \left(\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {- \alpha} c _ {t} ^ {*} = y _ {t}, \\ \left(\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \exp (- t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {- \alpha} c _ {t} + \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (- t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {\alpha - 1} c _ {t} ^ {*} = y _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ \left(\frac {\pi}{1 - \pi} \frac {\left(c _ {t}\right) ^ {- \gamma}}{\left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {- \gamma^ {*}}}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2 \alpha - 1}} = \frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})} = \exp (t o t _ {t}). \\ \end{array}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.28. To illustrate the equilibrium dynamics, let us consider a simple example. Suppose  $\gamma = 2$  and  $\gamma^{*} = 8$ ,  $\alpha = 0.7$ , and  $\pi = 0.5$ . The endowment shocks  $y_{t}$  and  $y_{t}^{*}$  are always equal. Figure 7.1 traces out the equilibrium consumption

allocations  $c_t$  and  $c_t^*$  for home and foreign households as we vary the endowments. We can see that, as the endowments become higher in both countries, the home country's consumption increases faster while the foreign country's consumption increases slower. In other words, the home country takes away a greater share of the endowments in high-endowment states, while the foreign country takes away a greater share of the endowments in low-endowment states. In this way, the home country insures the foreign country in the bad states in exchange for higher pay-off in good states.

Figure 7.1: Equilibrium Consumption Allocation under the Insurance View.

We can frame the same pattern in terms of international transfer, which we plot in Figure 7.2. The home country's net transfer is defined as the value of its endowment minus the value of its consumption, normalized by the value of its endowment. In this model, the only reason why the home households' endowment and consumption are different is because the home households transfer resources to the foreign households according to the risk-sharing agreement. The net home transfer to the foreign country is positive when the endowments are low, and negative when the endowments are high. In other words, the home country earns profits in good times as a compensation for its insurance provision, and bears the losses in bad times as the insurance pays off. The foreign country's net transfer has the opposite pattern, as it is the recipient of the international insurance.

Unconditionally, because the agents are willing to pay more for pay-offs in bad states, the U.S. receives a higher insurance premium in good times than it pays off in bad times, making a net profit from its insurance provision. This profit funds a persistent trade deficit on

average.

Figure 7.2: Equilibrium International Transfer under the Insurance View.  
Figure 7.3 plots the equilibrium real exchange rate  $e_t$ , which measures the strength of the home currency (i.e., the dollar). The dollar is stronger in high-endowment states and weaker in low-endowment states. This is because, due to home bias in consumption, when the home households receive a greater share of the endowments, they prefer to consume more home goods. Their demand bids up the price of the home goods, and generates real dollar appreciation. Conversely, when the aggregate endowment is low, the foreign households receive a wealth transfer from the U.S. and consume more domestic goods, leading to real dollar depreciation.

# 7.A.2 Decentralized Competitive Equilibrium

The social planner approach allows us to derive the equilibrium allocations and prices in complete markets. We are also interested in how the households trade to implement this equilibrium. In this subsection, we convert the problem to a continuous-time setting in order to derive the portfolio choice in the decentralized competitive equilibrium. Time is finite with horizon  $T$ . The representative home households maximize

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \delta^ {t} \frac {1}{1 - \gamma} (c _ {t}) ^ {1 - \gamma} d t \right],
$$

and the representative foreign households maximize

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \delta^ {t} \frac {1}{1 - \gamma^ {*}} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \gamma^ {*}} d t \right].
$$

For simplicity, we assume that the home and foreign endowments are identical, i.e.,  $y_{t} = y_{t}^{*}$ , reflecting a common global cycle. We assume

$$
d \log y _ {t} = d \log y _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa (\log \bar {y} - \log y _ {t}) d t + \sigma d W _ {t},
$$

which implies

$$
\log y _ {t} = e ^ {- \kappa t} \log y _ {0} + (1 - e ^ {- \kappa t}) \log \bar {y} + \sigma e ^ {- \kappa t} \int_ {0} ^ {t} e ^ {\kappa s} d W _ {s} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(e ^ {- \kappa t} \log y _ {0} + (1 - e ^ {- \kappa t}) \log \bar {y}, \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{2 \kappa} (1 - e ^ {- 2 \kappa t})\right).
$$

The social planner's problem in continuous time is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \delta^ {t} \left(\pi \frac {1}{1 - \gamma} (c _ {t}) ^ {1 - \gamma} + (1 - \pi) \frac {1}{1 - \gamma^ {*}} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \gamma^ {*}}\right) d t \right]
$$

subject to  $c_{H,t} + c_{H,t}^{*} = y_{t}$  and  $c_{F,t} + c_{F,t}^{*} = y_{t}^{*}$ . As we discussed in Proposition 1.3 in Section 1.C, we can solve for the consumption  $c_{t}, c_{t}^{*}$  and the exchange rate  $e_{t}$  as functions of  $k_{t}$ , which in turn depends on  $y_{t} = y_{t}^{*}$ .

We define the home and foreign SDFs as

$$
\exp (m _ {t}) = \delta^ {t} \pi (c _ {t}) ^ {- \gamma}, \qquad \exp (m _ {t} ^ {*}) = \delta^ {t} (1 - \pi) (c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma^ {*}},
$$

which allows us to evaluate the wealth claims in local numériaires as the present values of the consumption streams

$$
a _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {\exp (m _ {k})}{\exp (m _ {t})} c _ {k} d k \right], \quad a _ {t} ^ {*} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {\exp (m _ {k} ^ {*})}{\exp (m _ {t} ^ {*})} c _ {k} ^ {*} d k \right]. \tag {7.1}
$$

Similarly, we can evaluate the world equity claim in the home numérique as the present value of the endowment streams

$$
s _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {\exp (m _ {k})}{\exp (m _ {t})} \left(p _ {k} y _ {k} + \frac {p _ {k} ^ {*}}{\exp (e _ {k})} y _ {k} ^ {*}\right) d k \right].
$$

Thanks to our simplifying assumption  $y_{t} = y_{t}^{*}$ , the equilibrium asset prices  $a_{t}, a_{t}^{*}$ , and  $s_{t}$  are all functions of  $y_{t}$ . For example, if  $a_{t} = f(\log y_{t})$ , then, we can express the wealth dynamics as

$$
\begin{array}{l} d a _ {t} = \left[ f ^ {\prime} (\log y _ {t}) \kappa (\log \bar {y} - \log y _ {t}) + \frac {1}{2} f ^ {\prime \prime} (\log y _ {t}) \sigma^ {2} \right] d t + f ^ {\prime} (\log y _ {t}) \sigma d W _ {t} \\ \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \mu_ {a, t} d t + \sigma_ {a, t} d W _ {t}. \tag {7.2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Likewise, we can derive the world equity price's dynamics and denote it as

$$
d s _ {t} = \mu_ {s, t} d t + \sigma_ {s, t} d W _ {t}.
$$

Then, to compute the home and foreign households' portfolio choices, we need to take a stance on the set of assets that we use to replicate the wealth dynamics. Because the markets are complete, there are infinitely many sets of assets that span the endowment shock. We choose the home risk-free bond and the world equity claim to construct the replicating portfolios. Let  $x_{t}$  denote the weight on world equity in home households' portfolio, and let  $x_{t}^{*}$  denote the weight on world equity in foreign households' portfolio.

If we match the home households' wealth dynamics (7.2) with the wealth dynamics implied from consumption and portfolio holdings, i.e.,

$$
d a _ {t} = a _ {t} \left(x _ {t} \frac {d s _ {t} + \left(p _ {t} y _ {t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}\right) d t}{s _ {t}} + (1 - x _ {t}) r _ {t} d t\right) - c _ {t} d t,
$$

we can use the Martingale representation theorem to obtain the portfolio choice  $x_{t}$  from

$$
\frac {\sigma_ {a , t}}{a _ {t}} = x _ {t} \frac {\sigma_ {s , t}}{s _ {t}}.
$$

Similarly, we match the foreign households' wealth dynamics, i.e.,

$$
d \left(a _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})\right) = \mu_ {a ^ {*}, t} d t + \sigma_ {a ^ {*}, t} d W _ {t},
$$

with the wealth dynamics implied from consumption and the replicating portfolio, i.e.,

$$
a _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) \left(x _ {t} ^ {*} \frac {d s _ {t} + \left(p _ {t} y _ {t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}\right) d t}{s _ {t}} + \left(1 - x _ {t} ^ {*}\right) r _ {t} d t\right) - c _ {t} ^ {*} d t,
$$

to obtain the portfolio choice  $x_{t}^{*}$

We implement this algorithm with  $\bar{y} = \bar{y}^{*} = 1.84$ ,  $\kappa = 0.1$ ,  $\sigma = 0.05$ ,  $T = 500$  and  $\delta = 0.97$ . We study the equilibrium allocations and asset prices at time  $t = 0$ , as a function of the endowment level  $y_{0} = y_{0}^{*}$ . Conceptually, we can think of the economy as being created

at  $t = -\tau < 0$ , and the endowment shocks from time  $-\tau$  to 0 push the endowment level to  $y_0$  at time 0.

Figure 7.4 plots the equilibrium wealth share of the U.S. households, defined as  $a_0 / (a_0 + a_0^* \exp(-e_0))$ . Consistent with the U.S. earning a risk premium in good times and paying off the insurance in bad times, the U.S. households' wealth share is higher in high-endowment states and lower in low-endowment states. In other words, the U.S. households' financial holdings are more exposed to adverse endowment shocks, leading to a countercyclical wealth share.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/4caa6424-992f-437c-ac5a-4f95ef04f006/3e54252d2d81b087e86691f92fa4a711582bcfa42c86f3058e5050953a65b1e6.jpg)  
Figure 7.4: Equilibrium Wealth Share of U.S. Households.

Since the U.S. households have lower risk aversion, as their wealth share declines in low endowment states, the wealth-weighted average investor's risk aversion is also countercyclical. As a result, the risk premium on the world equity is higher and the equity return becomes more volatile in bad times. Figure 7.5 shows the overall negative relationship between the endowment level and the equity return volatility.

Perhaps paradoxically, as the equity becomes riskier, it magnifies the difference in risk aversion between the U.S. and foreign households, which leads to further divergence in their portfolio choices. Figure 7.6 reports the equilibrium portfolio allocation towards the world equity by the U.S. and foreign households,  $x_{t}$  and  $x_{t}^{*}$ . The U.S. households' equity share is always above 1, and the foreign households' is always below 1, which is consistent with our intuition that the U.S. takes a more levered position on risky assets while the foreign households seek safety in the U.S. risk-free bond. When the endowment level is lower, the U.S. households take a more levered position on the world equity despite suffering greater wealth losses,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/4caa6424-992f-437c-ac5a-4f95ef04f006/3c7f60d59f3db3a524e8248e05d1f2ee368229132d008218419f11e3a9d7a6e5.jpg)  
Figure 7.5: Volatility of World Equity Return in Dollar.

while the foreign households further reduce their equity shares. That said, in the region of very low endowments, the U.S. wealth share can become so small that they offer only tiny amount of risk-free bond despite their highly levered positions. In this case, the foreign households' equity share increases. In the limit, as the U.S. wealth shrinks much faster than the foreign wealth, the foreign households have to hold the entire world equity and no risk-free bond.

This countercyclical behavior of asset return volatility and risk premium also provides a motivation for the more reduced-form specification of the SDFs that we considered in Eq. (3.1) and (3.2) in

Section 3.A.

# 7.A.3 The Cyclicality of Bond Holdings

Finally, we plot the equilibrium U.S. bond holdings by foreign households. Unconditionally, the foreign households' holdings are always positive, which again reflects the leveraged nature of the U.S. portfolios. Conditionally, while the foreign households' portfolio share in the U.S. bond increases when the endowment level declines, their dollar-denominated wealth declines even faster. The dollar value of their bond holdings, which are equal to their product, thus decline in bad times under our model specification. In addition to the dollar exchange rate's cyclicality, this procyclical bond holding is another implication that is inconsistent with the flight-to-safety pattern in data.

Figure 7.7: Equilibrium U.S. Bond Holding by Foreign Households.

This observation opens up a broader discussion of what is so special about reserve assets. If the reserve assets are about providing insurance against risks, then, investors want to hold them before the risks materialize, and in particular when the probabilities of the negative shocks are high. However, what we observe in the data is flight to safety after the negative shocks have already happened, which could have a different motivation than precautionary savings.

One way to generate the countercyclical bond demand under the frictionless model is to assume that the bad states of the world mean not only low endowments, but also greater risk quantities or risk prices, which are consistent with the countercyclical behaviors of the VIX index. For example, in Gourinchas and Rey [2022], the foreign

investors' risk aversion goes up in bad times, which increases the risk price and generates greater demand for safe assets.

An alternative approach is to introduce frictions in the model. In Section 7.C, we will consider a reduced-form way of capturing these frictions by introducing a countercyclical convenience yield for the U.S. bond. In this case, non-pecuniary benefits of safe assets lead to greater demand for the U.S. bond after the negative shocks have already happened.

# 7.B The Reserve Currency Paradox

The insurance provision view provides a powerful tool for understanding the asymmetry in portfolio holdings and asset returns between the U.S. and the rest of the world. It offers a rational, risk-based explanation for why the U.S. enjoys the exorbitant privilege.

However, this view in its most basic form leads to a counterfactual prediction. As we saw in Figure 7.2, the U.S. pays out insurance in bad times by transferring wealth to the foreign country. As such, being the world's insurance provider has a cost: in the language of Gourinchas and Rey [2022], the exorbitant privilege comes with an exorbitant duty. As the foreign households have relatively higher wealth during global downturns, and they have a home bias towards foreign goods, the dollar has to depreciate in real terms as we saw in Figure 7.3.

In the data, the dollar tends to appreciate during global downturns. Maggiori [2017] notes this inconsistency and names it the Reserve Currency Paradox. Below, we provide two complementary ways of thinking about this paradox. In doing so, we set the stage for an alternative view of the global imbalances that we develop in the next section.

# 7.B.1 Demand vs. Supply Shocks

In Maggiori [2017]'s original analysis of the reserve currency paradox, he provides a simple resolution by introducing a state-dependent trade cost. If the cost of shipping goods internationally is higher during recessions, the U.S. economy effectively becomes more closed and the U.S. households' demand for the U.S. goods increases relative to their demand for foreign goods, leading to real dollar appreciation.

We can think of this variation in the trade cost as a demand shock, whereas the baseline setup we considered that gives rise to the reserve currency paradox is only about the supply shock. The U.S. transfer to the rest of the world increases the supply of the U.S. goods in the foreign countries. Given the foreigners' downward-

sloping demand for the U.S. goods, the U.S. goods have to become cheaper and generate real dollar depreciation.

Other types of demand shocks could also reverse the dollar exchange rate's cyclicality. Consider, for example, the bond convenience yields we studied in Chapter 4, which capture demand shocks for assets instead of goods. In particular, the foreigners' demand for U.S. safe assets increases in bad times, which leads to dollar appreciation. Similarly, by introducing time-varying risk aversion as another type of demand shock, Gourinchas and Rey [2022] also generates dollar appreciation in bad times in a slight extension of the baseline model.

# 7.B.2 Net Foreign Assets vs. Total Wealth

The insurance provision view emphasizes the international transfer of wealth from the U.S. to the rest of the world that occurs during global recessions. Figure 7.8 plots the U.S. net foreign assets (NFA) normalized by the U.S. consumption in our model. The U.S. NFA is defined as the U.S. holdings of foreign equity minus foreign holdings of U.S. equity and bond:

$$
n f a _ {t} = a _ {t} x _ {t} \frac {s _ {F , t}}{s _ {t}} - a _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) x _ {t} ^ {*} \frac {s _ {H , t}}{s _ {t}} - a _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) (1 - x _ {t} ^ {*}),
$$

where  $s_{H,t}$  and  $s_{F,t}$  denote the value of the U.S. and foreign equity in the U.S. numétaire, respectively. In bad times, the U.S. external assets, which are the world equity, depreciate more than the U.S. external liabilities, which include the risk-free bond. As a result, the U.S. NFA deteriorates along with the U.S. wealth share.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/4caa6424-992f-437c-ac5a-4f95ef04f006/826b233ec63fc9508b9487be4ba75c58f043154542637b8518cd5685ac824ab4.jpg)  
Figure 7.8: Equilibrium U.S. NFA/Consumption Ratio.

In this model, low endowments are associated with low U.S. wealth share and low U.S. NFA. Conceptually, these two quantities

are related by

$$
a _ {t} = s _ {H, t} + n f a _ {t}, \tag {7.3}
$$

which states that the U.S. wealth is equal to the value of U.S.-issued assets adjusted by the U.S. NFA. If the U.S. households hold a lot of foreign assets, the NFA will be positive and the U.S. wealth will be higher than the value of the domestic assets. Conversely, if the foreign households hold a lot of U.S. assets, the NFA will be negative and the U.S. wealth will be lower than the value of the domestic assets. In our model, both the value of the domestic wealth  $s_{H,t}$  and the NFA  $nfa_t$  are procyclical, leading to a procyclical U.S. wealth share that we saw in Figure 7.4. In Section 9.A, we will have a more detailed discussion of the net foreign assets accounting.

One essential feature of this model that leads to the reserve currency paradox is the procyclical U.S. wealth share: as the foreign households are relatively wealthier in bad times, they tend to consume more and tilt their consumption towards the foreign goods, which requires the U.S. goods to become cheaper. However, does the U.S. wealth share have to be procyclical? In the next section, we will examine a complementary view under which the U.S.-issued assets are better hedged against bad states of the world. As a result, while the U.S. NFA  $nfa_{t}$  still declines in bad times, the U.S. domestic assets  $s_{H,t}$  depreciate less and offset the procyclical nature of the U.S. NFA, leading to a countercyclical U.S. wealth share.

# 7.C The Safe Asset View

Next, we consider a complementary safe asset view, which emphasizes the U.S.' role as the sole supplier of the world's safe assets. The key difference from the insurance provision view is that investors derive non-pecuniary benefits from holding dollar safe assets such as the U.S. Treasury bonds, which leads to a convenience yield. This convenience yield enters the standard Euler equation as a wedge, which, as we saw in Chapter 4, makes progress in explaining the exchange rate dynamics. Building on the analysis in Chapter 4, our hypothesis here is that this ingredient also helps us understand the global imbalances and international transfers.

Our derivation loosely follows a simplified version of Jiang [2023a]. Earlier works on safe assets in international macro models include Caballero and Farhi [2018], Farhi and Maggiori [2018], Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas [2021], Gopinath and Stein [2021], Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig [2020a].

We consider an endowment economy that is very similar to the one we considered in Section 4.A. The government in each country

issues an exogenously specified amount of risk-free bond, which is held by the households in both countries. Let  $\bar{b}_t$  and  $\bar{b}_t^*$  denote the quantity of bonds issued by the home and foreign governments. The proceeds from the issuance are transferred to the local households.

The home households' utility is derived over consumption and the market value of home and foreign bond holdings:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(\frac {1}{1 - \gamma} c _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma} + \frac {1}{1 - \sigma} \omega_ {H, t} b _ {H, t} ^ {1 - \sigma} + \frac {1}{1 - \sigma} \omega_ {F, t} b _ {F, t} ^ {1 - \sigma}\right) \right],
$$

subject to the budget constraint

$$
p _ {t} y _ {t} + \exp (r _ {t - 1}) b _ {H, t - 1} + \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - e _ {t}) b _ {F, t - 1} = c _ {t} + b _ {H, t} + \exp (- e _ {t}) b _ {F, t} + (\exp (r _ {t - 1}) \bar {b} _ {t - 1} - \bar {b} _ {t}).
$$

The home households' consumption is a basket of home and foreign goods:  $c_{t} = (c_{H,t})^{\alpha}(c_{F,t})^{1 - \alpha}$ . Following the same derivation in Section 4.A, we obtain the following Euler equations:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1}}{c _ {t}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (r _ {t}) + \frac {\omega_ {H , t} b _ {H , t} ^ {- \sigma}}{c _ {t} ^ {- \gamma}} \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1}}{c _ {t}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (- \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}) + \frac {\omega_ {F , t} b _ {F , t} ^ {- \sigma}}{c _ {t} ^ {- \gamma}} \exp (e _ {t}) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

Similarly, the foreign households' utility is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(\frac {1}{1 - \gamma} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {1 - \gamma} + \frac {1}{1 - \sigma} \omega_ {H, t} ^ {*} \left(b _ {H, t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma} + \left(\bar {c} ^ {*}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \theta_ {H, t} ^ {*} b _ {H, t} ^ {*} + \frac {1}{1 - \sigma} \omega_ {F, t} ^ {*} \left(b _ {F, t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {1 - \sigma}\right) \right],
$$

subject to the budget constraint

$$
p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} + \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}) b _ {F, t - 1} ^ {*} + \exp (r _ {t - 1} + e _ {t}) b _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} = c _ {t} ^ {*} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*} + \exp (e _ {t}) b _ {H, t} ^ {*} + (\exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}) \bar {b} _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - \bar {b} _ {t} ^ {*}).
$$

Likewise, we obtain the following Euler equations for the foreign households:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {*}) + \frac {\omega_ {F} ^ {*} (b _ {F , t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \sigma}}{(c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma}} \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (\Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) + \frac {\omega_ {H} ^ {*} (b _ {H , t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \sigma} + (\bar {c} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma} \theta_ {H , t} ^ {*}}{(c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma}} \exp (- e _ {t}) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

We have chosen a parsimonious specification of the safe asset demand. The terms  $\omega_{H}^{*}(b_{H,t}^{*})^{-\sigma}$  and  $\omega_{F}^{*}(b_{F,t}^{*})^{-\sigma}$  capture the downward-sloping demand for each type of bonds, which helps us pin down the equilibrium quantities of bonds held by home and foreign households. The additional term  $(\bar{c}^{*})^{-\gamma}\theta_{H,t}^{*}$  captures a demand shifter, which reflects the foreign households' time-varying and countercyclical demand for dollar safe assets. In general, we could have inserted this demand shifter for the home households and for the foreign bond as well, but one demand shifter is sufficient to capture the key features of the model, which we will study in more detail below.

# 7.C.1 Macro Synthesis

We consider a simple case in which the government debt supply is constant and, the bond demand shock  $\theta_{H,t}^{*}$  is exogenous. The exogenous variables are the endowments and the foreign households' dollar asset preferences:

$$
\left(y _ {t}, y _ {t} ^ {*}, \theta_ {H, t} ^ {*}\right) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}.
$$

There are 15 endogenous variables in each period  $t$ :

$$
(c _ {t}, c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}, b _ {H, t}, b _ {F, t}, p _ {t}, c _ {t} ^ {*}, c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}, b _ {H, t} ^ {*}, b _ {F, t} ^ {*}, p _ {t} ^ {*}, r _ {t}, r _ {t} ^ {*}, e _ {t}) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}.
$$

The model implies the following 16 equations in each period, one of which is redundant. These 16 equations include 2 consumption aggregation equations,

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {t} = (c _ {H, t}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {F, t}) ^ {1 - \alpha}, \\ c _ {t} ^ {*} = (c _ {F, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {H, t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \alpha}, \\ \end{array}
$$

4 household budget conditions are

$$
\begin{array}{l} p _ {t} y _ {t} + \exp (r _ {t - 1}) b _ {H, t - 1} + \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - e _ {t}) b _ {F, t - 1} = c _ {t} + b _ {H, t} + \exp (- e _ {t}) b _ {F, t} + (\exp (r _ {t - 1}) \bar {b} _ {t - 1} - \bar {b} _ {t}), \\ c _ {t} = p _ {t} c _ {H, t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} \exp (- e _ {t}), \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} + \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}) b _ {F, t - 1} ^ {*} + \exp (r _ {t - 1} + e _ {t}) b _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} = c _ {t} ^ {*} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*} + \exp (e _ {t}) b _ {H, t} ^ {*} + (\exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}) \bar {b} _ {t - 1} ^ {*} - \bar {b} _ {t} ^ {*}), \\ c _ {t} ^ {*} = p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} ^ {*} + p _ {t} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} \exp (e _ {t}), \\ \end{array}
$$

2 goods market clearing conditions

$$
c _ {H, t} + c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = y _ {t},
$$

$$
c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = y _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

2 bond market clearing conditions

$$
\bar {b} _ {t} = b _ {H, t} + b _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
\bar {b} _ {t} ^ {*} = b _ {F, t} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

2 within-period consumption choices

$$
\frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})} = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}},
$$

and 4 Euler equations

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1}}{c _ {t}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (r _ {t}) + \frac {\omega_ {H} b _ {H , t} ^ {- \sigma}}{c _ {t} ^ {- \gamma}} \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1}}{c _ {t}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (- \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}) + \frac {\omega_ {F} b _ {F , t} ^ {- \sigma}}{c _ {t} ^ {- \gamma}} \exp (e _ {t}) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {*}) + \frac {\omega_ {F} ^ {*} (b _ {F , t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \sigma}}{(c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma}} \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (\Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) + \frac {\omega_ {H} ^ {*} (b _ {H , t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \sigma} + (\bar {c} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma} \theta_ {H , t} ^ {*}}{(c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma}} \exp (- e _ {t}) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

# 7.C.2 Model Characterization

Log-linearizing the Euler equations yields

$$
- \left(\lambda_ {H, t} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - m _ {t + 1} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \gamma \left(\Delta \log c _ {t + 1} - \Delta \log c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} \right].
$$

Let  $\bar{e} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \lim_{t \to \infty} e_t$  denote the long-term exchange rate level, which is well defined in a stationary economy. Iterating this equation forward, we obtain the following result.

Proposition 7.2. The exchange rate level is equal to the expected consumption growth differential and the expected convenience yield differential:

$$
\begin{array}{l} e _ {t} - \bar {e} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \gamma \left(\Delta \log c _ {t + j} - \Delta \log c _ {t + j} ^ {*}\right) \right] + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \lambda_ {H, t + j} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t + j} \right] \\ = - \gamma \left(\log \frac {c _ {t}}{\bar {c}} - \log \frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{\bar {c} ^ {*}}\right) + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \lambda_ {H, t + j} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t + j} \right], \tag {7.4} \\ \end{array}
$$

where the convenience yield differential on the U.S. bond is approximately

$$
\lambda_ {H, t} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t} \approx \frac {\omega_ {H} ^ {*} \left(b _ {H , t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {- \sigma}}{\left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {- \gamma}} \exp (- e _ {t}) - \frac {\omega_ {H} b _ {H , t} ^ {- \sigma}}{c _ {t} ^ {- \gamma}} - \theta_ {H, t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}). \tag {7.5}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.29. This result extends the exchange rate accounting formula in Proposition 4.2 with additional assumptions about household preferences, which provides the key to understand the exchange rate dynamics in response to different types of shocks. The right-hand side of Eq. (7.4) is a sum of two components. The first component is the marginal utility differential. When markets are complete, as we saw in Section 4.B.4, it is the only determinant of the exchange rate level. The second component is the sum of expected convenience yield differentials. It arises from the Euler equation wedges, and drives additional variations in the exchange rate dynamics. Interestingly, it is not the convenience yield

per se that affects the exchange rate, but the differential between the foreign investors' perspective and the home investors' perspective. To obtain a stronger dollar (i.e., a higher  $e_t$ ), we need the foreign investors' convenience yield on the dollar bond to exceed the home investors' convenience yield.

Eq. (7.5) further connects the convenience yield differential to the quantities of the U.S. bond held by foreign and U.S. households,  $b_{H,t}^{*}$  and  $b_{H,t}$ , and the exogenous demand shifter  $\theta_{H,t}^{*}$ . If the foreign households hold more U.S. bonds, their marginal utility from holding the U.S. bond is lower, which reduces their convenience yield  $\lambda_{H,t}^{*}$  and depreciates the dollar, unless the increase in the foreign households' holding is accompanied by a change in the demand shifter  $\theta_{H,t}^{*}$ .

In this way, the exchange rate dynamics are driven not only by the marginal utility differential, but also by the convenience yield differential. Heuristically, in complete markets, the exchange rate movement is determined by the differential in marginal utilities over consumption:

$$
\Delta e = \left(\Delta u _ {c} - \Delta u _ {c} ^ {*}\right).
$$

As recessions lower the local households' consumption, raise their marginal utility, and appreciate the local currency, the exchange rate is always counter-cyclical. However, in the data, exchange rates are acyclical or even procyclical, meaning that currencies tend to depreciate in bad times [Backus and Smith, 1993].

In comparison, after we introduce the non-pecuniary benefits of holding bonds, the exchange rate is determined by not only the differential in marginal utilities over consumption, but also the differential in marginal utilities over bond holding. Heuristically, we have

$$
\Delta e = \left(\Delta u _ {c} - \Delta u _ {c} ^ {*}\right) + \left(\Delta u _ {b} ^ {*} - \Delta u _ {b}\right),
$$

where  $\Delta u_{b}^{*} - \Delta u_{b}$  captures the marginal utility differentials over bond holding for current and future periods as we specified in Eq. (7.5).

Take the foreign households as an example. Recessions lower their wealth and reduce their holdings of the dollar safe assets. Given their downward-sloping demand curve for dollar safe assets, they impute a higher convenience yield and accept a lower expected return to hold the U.S. bond. To equilibrate their demand with the U.S. households, the dollar has to appreciate to generate an expected depreciation, which leads to a lower expected return to hold the U.S. bond from the foreign perspective. In this way, the demand for safe assets connects wealth decline to local currency depreciation. If the wealth declines more than consumption in recessions, this channel

based on marginal utilities over bonds could overturn the complete-market channel based on marginal utilities over consumption, and generate procyclical exchange rates.

# 7.C.3 Calibration and the Steady State

We log-linearize the model and solve the forward-looking first-order dynamics around a non-stochastic steady state. The details of this technique can be found in Christiano [2002], and Dynare offers a convenient implementation.

We find the non-stochastic steady state by setting all variables to be constant over time. For example, the home goods' market clearing condition becomes

$$
c _ {H, S S} + c _ {H, S S} ^ {*} = y _ {S S},
$$

and the foreign investors' Euler equation for home bonds becomes

$$
1 = \delta \exp (r _ {S S}) + \frac {\omega_ {H} ^ {*} (b _ {H , S S} ^ {*}) ^ {- \sigma} + c _ {S S} ^ {- \gamma} \theta_ {H , S S} ^ {*}}{c _ {S S} ^ {- \gamma}} \exp (- e _ {S S}),
$$

which uses  $\Delta e_{SS} = e_{SS} - e_{SS} = 0$  and  $c_{SS}^{*} / c_{SS}^{*} = 1$ .

We pick the following parameter values:  $\gamma = 1$ ,  $\sigma = 3$ ,  $\alpha = 0.85$ ,  $\delta = 0.99$ , and  $\bar{y} = \bar{y}^{*} = 1$ . We calibrate the variables  $\omega_{H} = \omega_{F}^{*}$ ,  $\omega_{H}^{*} = \omega_{F}$ , and  $\bar{\theta}_{H}^{*}$  such that in the non-stochastic steady state, the convenience yield on the home bond  $\lambda_{H,SS}$  is  $1.01\%$ , the convenience yield on the foreign bond  $\lambda_{F,SS}$  is  $0.50\%$ , the U.S. debt/output ratio  $\bar{b} / (p_{SS}y_{SS})$  is  $100\%$ , the foreign debt/output ratio  $\bar{b}^{*} / (p_{SS}^{*}y_{SS}^{*})$  is  $79\%$ ,  $b_{H,SS}^{*} / \bar{b} = 50\%$  of the U.S. bond is held by the foreign households, and  $b_{F,SS} / \bar{b}^{*} = 20\%$  of the foreign bond is held by the U.S. households. This set of targets implies that the U.S. net foreign asset is  $-34\%$  of the U.S. output in the steady state.

Table 7.1 reports the more details about the steady-state values. The U.S. consumption is slightly higher than the foreign consumption and on average the U.S. runs a permanent trade deficit equal to  $-0.08\%$  of the total output. This trade deficit is funded by the fact that the U.S. pays a lower interest rate on its external borrowing than the foreign country—a situation we refer to as the seigniorage revenue. Quantitatively, the U.S. borrows  $50\%$  of its output from the foreign households at an interest rate of  $0\%$ , whereas the foreign country borrows  $16\%$  of its output from the U.S. households at an interest rate of  $0.5\%$ . In the steady state, the foreign country pays the U.S. a net interest equal to  $16\% \times 0.5\% = 0.08\%$  of the foreign output. In reality, this seigniorage revenue could be much bigger if the discount rate on the foreign liabilities is higher than  $0.5\%$  or if the size of the foreign liabilities is greater than  $16\%$  of the foreign output in our calibration.

# 7.C.4 Flight to Safety and International Wealth Transfers

In the model we considered under the insurance provision view, we interpret a global crisis as a low endowment state. In this model, we are going to highlight a different aspect of a global crisis: a flight to safety. In particular, we focus on the foreign households' demand for the U.S. risk-free bond, which is captured by  $\theta_{H,t}^{*}$ . It is likely that an increase in the foreign households' safe asset demand is correlated with declines in home and foreign endowments. However, we first study this shock in isolation to highlight its role in resolving the reserve currency paradox.

Figure 7.9 reports the impulse responses to a shock to  $\theta_{H,t}^{*}$ . We assume that this shock dissipates slowly with an autocorrelation of 0.9. Upon the arrival of the shock, we see an increase in the foreign households' convenience yield  $\lambda_{H,t}^{*}$  on the dollar risk-free bond, defined as

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {H, t} ^ {*}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (\Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) \right].
$$

Through the exchange rate formula we derived in Proposition 4.2, Section 4.B, generalized below,

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} ] + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \lambda_ {H, t + j} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {F, t + j} ^ {*} ] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r p _ {t + j} ] + \bar {e},
$$

the increase in the convenience yield on the dollar bond appreciates the dollar. It is worth noting that the dollar appreciation requires us to break the complete-market condition (1.16), reproduced below,

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} = - \Delta c _ {t + 1} + \Delta c _ {t + 1} ^ {*},
$$

Figure 7.9: Impulse Responses to Dollar Bond Demand Shock. The variables are the foreign demand for the dollar bond, the foreign convenience yield, the dollar's log exchange rate, the log consumption differential, the log wealth differential, the trade balance/output ratio, the NFA/output ratio, the fraction of dollar bonds held by foreign households, and the fraction of foreign bonds held by U.S. households.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/4caa6424-992f-437c-ac5a-4f95ef04f006/4e98e9d6f7427478c887abdae3bb4363cc87a29b7bb4ca6ef50f2ee8c6a82165.jpg)

because, as we will see below, the U.S. consumption is relatively higher than the foreign consumption in the flight-to-safety episodes, leading to a lower U.S. households' marginal utilities and hence a weaker dollar under complete markets.

On the quantity side, the foreign households' purchase of the dollar bond is financed by reducing their consumption and their holding of the foreign bond. As a result, the transfer of the dollar bond from the U.S. households to the foreign households is accompanied by a transfer of consumption goods and the foreign bond from the foreign households to the U.S. households. The U.S. households' consumption increases relative to the foreign households' consumption.

This increase in U.S. relative consumption reflects a seigniorage revenue that the U.S. earns from issuing bonds that carry convenience yields. By issuing expensive bonds in high convenience yield states, the U.S. receives real resources from the rest of the world. If the convenience yield shock is persistent, the seigniorage revenue is

also expected to last, leading to an increase in the expected future seigniorage revenues. This increase in the expected future seigniorage revenues is reflected in the U.S. households' wealth  $a_{t}$ , which is defined as the present value of their consumption streams:

$$
a _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {s} \frac {c _ {s} ^ {- \gamma}}{c _ {t} ^ {- \gamma}} c _ {s} \right].
$$

This wealth effect is the key distinguishing feature of the safe asset view, as it disentangles the response in the U.S. wealth  $a_{t}$  from the response in the U.S. net foreign assets  $nfa_{t}$ . On the one hand, the U.S. buys some foreign bonds from the foreign country and sells some dollar bonds to the foreign country. In a flight-to-dollar episode, the dollar appreciates and the U.S. suffers a loss on its external portfolio, leading to a decline in the U.S. NFA. On the other hand, the U.S. receives a higher seigniorage revenue from issuing the dollar bonds, which increases the U.S. wealth despite its loss on the external portfolio.

In this model, a higher U.S. wealth relative to the foreign wealth leads to a higher U.S. consumption relative to the foreign consumption. In the special case with log preferences, the U.S. households' consumption is proportional to their wealth:

$$
c _ {t} = (1 - \delta) a _ {t}.
$$

Due to the home bias in the U.S. households' consumption, the U.S. spends more on the U.S. goods, which appreciates the dollar in real terms. In this way, the goods market clearing also implies a stronger dollar that is consistent with the convenience yield channel in the asset market. As such, a decline in the U.S. NFA does not necessarily imply a relative wealth gain for the foreign households and a stronger demand for the foreign goods. The reserve currency paradox is resolved by engineering a countercyclical U.S. wealth share from the seigniorage revenue.

This discussion highlights the countercyclicality of the U.S. wealth share as the key to understand the cyclical properties of international transfers. Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig [2020a] presents a simple calculation around 2008, and shows that the decline in the market value of the U.S. equities, bonds, and deposits was indeed less than the decline in the market value of the equities, bonds, and deposits in major developed foreign countries after converting to the dollar units. This relative gain in market value was also higher than the loss in the U.S. NFA. Dahlquist, Heyerdahl-Larsen, Pavlova, and Pénasse [2022], Kim [2022] present additional empirical evidence in favor of a countercyclical U.S. wealth share, whereas Sauzet [2022] presents a calculation that suggests the opposite. It is possible that the wealth

calculation includes different types of agents and assets in these studies, and more work is needed to think about the appropriate definition of wealth and reconcile these findings.

Finally, we note that there are alternative approaches to simultaneously address the cyclicality of the dollar and that of the international transfers and resolve the reserve currency paradox. Kekre and Lenel [2021], Sauzet [2022], Devereux, Engel, and Wu [2023] engineer greater recessions in the U.S. relative to the foreign countries during global downturns, which raise the U.S. marginal utility relative to the foreign marginal utility and appreciate the dollar. Dahlquist, Heyerdahl-Larsen, Pavlova, and Pénasse [2022] consider a different mechanism that emphasizes the time-varying demand for the U.S. goods, which also generates a countercyclical U.S. wealth share as in our model. Finally, the demand shift towards the U.S. goods is considered by Maggiori [2017] as a way to engineer a dollar appreciation during global downturns.

All of these resolutions can be framed under the goods market and the asset market views of the exchange rate in Section 1.D. Specifically, Eq. (1.19), reproduced below,

$$
\left(\frac {2 \alpha - 1}{\gamma} + 2 (1 - \alpha) \frac {2 \alpha}{2 \alpha - 1}\right) e _ {t} = - \left(\log y _ {t} - \log y _ {t} ^ {*} - \frac {2 \alpha - 1}{\gamma} \tau_ {t} ^ {A M} + \tau_ {t} ^ {G M}\right),
$$

shows that both the asset market wedge  $\tau_t^{AM}$  and the goods market wedge  $\tau_t^{GM}$  can impact the exchange rate  $e_t$  and its cyclicality. Each of the above resolutions proposes a specific wedge that deviates from the frictionless benchmark and generates the dollar exchange rate's countercyclicality.

# 7.D The Stability of the International Monetary System

Having presented the two views of the reserve currency paradigm, we briefly survey two important issues related to the stability of the international monetary system. This discussion is based on a large body of literature on the international monetary system.

# 7.D.1 Triffin's Dilemma

In the Bretton-Woods system with a de-jure dollar standard, foreign countries peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. in turn pegs the dollar to the price of gold. Triffin [1960] foresaw an emerging imbalance. He argued that, as the world demand for dollar reserve assets grew with the world economy, the U.S. will inevitably run out of gold backing for its supply of reserve assets. Eventually, the erosion of backing will lead to a run on the dollar and the collapse of the international monetary system. This is the famous Triffin

dilemma, which highlights the tension between providing liquidity demanded by a growing world economy and maintaining the value of the reserve currency.

In response to Triffin's critique of the Bretton-Woods system, Despres, Kindleberger, and Salant [1966] propose the famous minority view, which holds that the U.S., equipped with the deepest and most liquid financial markets in the world, is a natural world banker which provides liquid assets to the world. Like banks, this intermediation process can be stable for a long period of time. While this U.S.-as-world-banker view survives and exerts a strong influence on the modern literature, Triffin proved to be prescient. The U.S. ran out of its gold backing for its growing dollar liabilities in the early 1970s. As a result, it was forced to devalue the dollar relative to gold in 1971 and eventually abandon convertibility from the dollar to gold in 1973. Exchange rates became free-floating and the Bretton-Woods system collapsed.

In today's world, we live with a de-facto dollar standard. Both the insurance provision view and the safe asset view hold that the world has a strong demand for dollar reserve assets, whose backing is provided by revenue streams of firms and governments instead of gold. One can in fact argue that this is an extraordinary feat of financial engineering, as the U.S. managed to manufacture reserve assets backed by risky (pro-cyclical) cash flows instead of steady collaterals such as gold. In this sense, as Gourinchas, Rey, and Sauzet [2019] point out, "Triffin's analysis, however, was incomplete because, despite the abandonment of the dollar-gold parity, the dominance of the dollar has increased since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Paradoxically, once free from the shackle of a fixed gold parity, the use of the US dollar as an international currency soared to unprecedented levels. Yet, as we argue, the financial fragilities inherent in a hegemonic system have not disappeared: The Triffin dilemma is still with us, albeit in a subtly different form."

Indeed, we may expect two new forms of Triffin dilemma in today's world. First, the increasing demand for dollar safe assets may be met with insufficient fiscal backing [Gourinchas and Rey, 2007b, 2022, Farhi, Gourinchas, and Rey, 2011, Obstfeld, 2011, Farhi and Maggiori, 2018, Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan, 2019], which makes the U.S. become a more leveraged safe asset supplier. We will discuss this issue in greater details in Chapter 8.

Second, the premium on the dollar debt incentivizes foreign issuers to also dollarize their liabilities, while their revenues are mostly in local currency terms and thus generate a currency mismatch on their balance sheets. As Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig [2020a] write, "as a result, a different form of instability appears: as the world demand for dollar grows, the incentive for both U.S. and foreign issuers to

supply dollar assets will grow. In particular, if the growth in the world demand for dollar safe assets exceeds the growth in U.S. supply, the result will be growth in currency-mismatched balance sheets around the world. The conclusion is that financial spillovers and the global financial cycle may grow in importance."

This currency mismatch can be incurred by foreign governments, firms, and banks as they take advantage of the convenience yield on dollar funding. A large literature studies this issue from both theoretical and empirical angles. See Caballero and Krishnamurthy [2003], Schneider and Tornell [2004], Bocola and Lorenzoni [2020], Du, Pflueger, and Schreger [2020], Du and Schreger [2022b], Salomao and Varela [2022], Gutierrez, Ivashina, and Salomao [2023].

# 7.D.2 The Global Financial Cycle and the Impossible Duo

Another form of international fluctuations arises in the form of a global financial cycle. Rey [2015], Miranda-Agrippino and Rey [2015] find a strong commonality in the fluctuations in capital flows, asset prices, and credit growth around the world, and this cycle is aligned with the VIX and the dollar. In this sense, we can think of the VIX and the dollar as barometers of global risk appetite. Moreover, the U.S. monetary policy plays a key role in driving this global financial cycle, with a U.S. monetary tightening triggering collapses in asset prices and retrenchment in capital flows. In comparison, other countries' monetary policies appear to be less important [Gerko and Rey, 2017].

This global financial cycle challenges how we think about the independence of monetary policy. The classical Mundell-Flemming model presents the impossible trinity: with free capital mobility, independent monetary policies are feasible if and only if exchange rates are floating. This result is obtained in canonical models that focus on the interest rate channel alone, as the exchange rate can endogenously adjust to make independent interest rate targets possible.

The global financial cycle shows that the policy space is more constrained, leading to an impossible duo [Rey, 2015, Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015]: with free capital mobility, floating exchange rates do not guarantee monetary policy independence because asset prices and capital flows still respond to global factors. In light of our exchange rate accounting formula in Proposition 4.2, reproduced below,

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} ] + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \lambda_ {t + j} ^ {*} ] - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r p _ {t + j} ] + \bar {e},
$$

the traditional impossible trinity view can be thought of as focusing on the interest rate term, i.e.,  $r_{t+j} - r_{t+j}^*$ . Ignoring the convenience

yield and the risk premium terms, we can expect the variations in the exchange rate to absorb the shocks to the autonomous interest rate policies. In comparison, the impossible duo view emphasizes the risk premium terms  $rp_{t+j}$  and the convenience yield terms  $\lambda_{t+j}^{*}$ , which affect not only exchange rates but also domestic financial and economic conditions. Even with floating exchange rates, monetary policy responses are needed to address the influences of these external factors. As a result, monetary policies are not truly independent if the capital accounts are open and allow the risk premium and convenience yield shocks to spill over.

# Government Debt

# Summary

- If we look backward, the market value of government debt is determined by past debt, primary surpluses, and debt returns:

$$
\frac {D _ {t}}{Y _ {t}} = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {t - 1} \frac {S _ {t - j}}{Y _ {t - j}} \exp (R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D} - X _ {t - j \rightarrow t}) + \frac {D _ {0}}{Y _ {0}} \exp (R _ {0 \rightarrow t} ^ {D} - X _ {0 \rightarrow t}).
$$

- If we look forward, the market value of government debt is backed by the present value of future primary surpluses:

$$
D _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) S _ {t + k} \right] + \lim  _ {k \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) D _ {t + k} \right].
$$

- This forward-looking valuation equation also implies a trade-off in the risk dimension. The government has to choose between insuring the debtholders and insuring the taxpayers.  
- In the cases of the U.S. and past reserve asset issuers, the market value of government debt may exceed its fiscal backing, leading to a public debt valuation puzzle.

In the last chapter, we saw two accounts of the international monetary system that both regard safe assets as the key ingredient. One view emphasizes the international risk-sharing arrangement that is implemented by the U.S. supplying safe assets and taking a levered position on riskier claims, whereas the other view focuses on the foreigners' countercyclical demand for safe assets. In reality, most safe assets are government debt. In fact, when the U.S. establishes its status as the world's reserve asset supplier, it is conceivable that the U.S. government debt first becomes an important reserve asset before other dollar-denominated private debt caught up in their status.

In this chapter, we study the valuation of government debt and issues related to fiscal sustainability in greater details. We build on Chapters 4, 6, and 7, in which we introduced one-period risk-free

government bonds. For example, in Chapter 6, the government budget condition in nominal terms can be expressed as

$$
Q _ {t} = S _ {t} + Q _ {t + 1} \exp (- i _ {t}),
$$

where  $S_{t}$  is the government primary surplus in nominal terms,  $Q_{t}$  is the nominal face value of the debt, and  $i_{t}$  is the log nominal risk-free rate.

Now, we consider more general cases in which the government can issue different types contingent claims, including the long-term bonds. Let  $D_{t}$  denote the market value of aggregate government debt portfolio, and let  $\exp(R_{t}^{D})$  denote its cum-coupon return. Then, the government budget condition can be expressed as

$$
D _ {t - 1} \exp \left(R _ {t} ^ {D}\right) = S _ {t} + D _ {t}, \tag {8.1}
$$

with the previous special case of one-period nominal risk-free bond attained when  $Q_{t} = D_{t - 1}\exp (R_{t}^{D})$  and  $R_{t}^{D} = i_{t - 1}$ .

Before we formally analyze this general case, let us consider a simple personal loan example. Suppose I borrow  \$100,000 today at the annual interest rate of \(5\%$  to purchase a house. The loan duration is 10 years, with constant payment each year. A simple calculation shows that the constant payment is \)12,950 each year. Table 8.1 reports the detailed loan schedule.

Now, suppose I stand at the beginning of year 6. I have made 5 loan payments in the past, and my outstanding balance is  \$56,069. This number has two interpretations. The first interpretation is based on backward-looking accounting: this outstanding balance of\$ 56,069 is a result of me repaying the loan in the past 5 years. In each year, after I pay back the interest that is equal to 5% times the outstanding loan balance, the remaining amount of my payment (i.e., the principal payment in the last column) contributes to the reduction of my outstanding loan amount over time. In other words, my outstand-

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Balance</td><td>Payment</td><td>Interest payment</td><td>Principal payment</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>$100,000</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$5,000</td><td>$7,950</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>$92,050</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$4,602</td><td>$8,348</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>$83,702</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$4,185</td><td>$8,765</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>$74,936</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$3,747</td><td>$9,204</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>$65,733</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$3,287</td><td>$9,664</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>$56,069</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$2,803</td><td>$10,147</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>$45,922</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$2,296</td><td>$10,654</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>$35,267</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$1,763</td><td>$11,187</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>$24,080</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$1,204</td><td>$11,746</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>$12,334</td><td>$12,950</td><td>$617</td><td>$12,334</td></tr></table>

Table 8.1: Personal Loan Example

ing balance of  \$56,069 in year 6 is equal to the initial loan amount of\$ 100,000 minus the sum of the first 5 principal payments.

The second interpretation is based on forward-looking valuation: my outstanding balance of  \$56,069 at the beginning of year 6 also reflects the present value of my remaining payments in the future. From the bank's perspective, my personal loan is valued at\$ 56,069 because this value describes the present value of the remaining 5 payments discounted at the interest rate of 5%. This discount rate, by the way, does not have to equal to the risk-free rate if the bank believes that I may default on the loan. In this way, my outstanding loan balance in a given year can be interpreted both as the result of past borrowing and payments, and as the discounted present value of future promised payments.

The analysis of government debt is similar to this example of personal loan. The only key difference is that the analysis of government debt tends to have an infinite horizon as the government is supposed to be long-lasting, whereas the personal finance products tend to have a pre-determined horizon. We next examine the backward-looking and forward-looking approaches to government debt following Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan [2023b].

# 8.A Backward-Looking Accounting

The backward-looking approach attributes variations in the debt/GDP ratio to the history of primary surpluses, output growth, inflation, and interest rates. Specifically, by iterating backward Eq. (8.1), we can write the debt today as a function of cumulative past returns and past primary deficits [Hall and Sargent, 2011].

Proposition 8.1. (a) The market value of government debt can be expressed as

$$
D _ {t} = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {t - 1} S _ {t - j} \exp \left(R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) + D _ {0} \exp \left(R _ {0 \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right), \tag {8.2}
$$

where  $R_{t - j\rightarrow t}^{D} = R_{t - j + 1}^{D} + \ldots R_{t - 1}^{D} + R_{t}^{D}$  is the cumulative debt return.

(b) We can restate this expression to obtain a backward-looking expression for the debt/GDP ratio:

$$
\frac {D _ {t}}{Y _ {t}} = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {t - 1} \frac {S _ {t - j}}{Y _ {t - j}} \exp \left(R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D} - X _ {t - j \rightarrow t}\right) + \frac {D _ {0}}{Y _ {0}} \exp \left(R _ {0 \rightarrow t} ^ {D} - X _ {0 \rightarrow t}\right), \tag {8.3}
$$

where  $\exp (X_{t - j\rightarrow t}) = Y_t / Y_{t - j}$  is the cumulative nominal GDP growth.

The proof is in Appendix A.30. As the government debt/GDP ratio is stationary in many models, it is usually easier to focus on

this ratio instead of the debt level. Proposition 8.1(b) shows that the current debt/GDP ratio depends on past primary surpluses and deficits: a greater borrowing in the past to finance deficits  $-S_{t-j}$  leads to a higher debt/GDP ratio today. Moreover, the borrowing is compounded by the growth-adjusted return  $R_{t-j\rightarrow t}^{D} - X_{t-j\rightarrow t}$ , so that high real debt returns, high inflation rates, and low output growth all magnify the past borrowing and contribute to a high debt/GDP ratio today.

In this way, the backward-looking approach provides a useful way to attribute the increase in the government debt/GDP ratio from time 0 to  $t$  to four components: government deficits, real debt returns, inflation, and output growth. Hall and Sargent [2011, 2022], Anderson and Leeper [2023] conduct such decomposition exercises in the history of the U.S. For example, the debt/GDP ratio increased from  $86\%$  to  $101\%$  in the Covid period from 2019 to 2023. Government deficits were the main contributor to the increase, while high inflation, positive real GDP growth, and negative debt returns all helped to partially offset the deficits.

We can also examine this result in a steady state in which debt returns, growth rates, and surplus/GDP ratios are all constants. Then, the steady-state debt/GDP ratio can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {D}{Y} = - \frac {S}{Y} \frac {1}{1 - \exp (R ^ {D} - X)} \approx \frac {S}{Y} \frac {1}{R ^ {D} - X}, \\ \frac {S}{Y} = \frac {D}{Y} (R ^ {D} - X). \\ \end{array}
$$

In real terms, we can express this relation as

$$
\frac {s}{y} = \frac {d}{y} (r ^ {D} - x), \tag {8.4}
$$

where  $r^D = R^D - \pi$  denotes the real return to the bond portfolio and  $x = X - \pi$  denotes the real growth rate.

First, consider the case in which the debt returns are higher than the GDP growth, i.e.,  $r^D > x$ . For a positive amount of debt, i.e.,  $d > 0$ , the government has to run a budget surplus in perpetuity, i.e.,  $s > 0$ , to pay off the interest and sustain the same debt/GDP level.

Then, consider the case in which the debt returns are lower than the GDP growth, i.e.,  $r^D < x$ . The literature usually denotes this condition by  $r < g$ . In this case, the government can roll over its debt in perpetuity while running steady-state deficits, i.e.,  $s < 0$ . Blanchard [2019] uses this logic to argue that the U.S. has an infinite debt capacity as long as the interest rate is lower than the GDP growth rate. In this environment, in fact, the government can start with an arbitrary amount of government debt. If it just rolls over its debt by raising

more debt to pay the interests due, then, the government debt quantity rises at the interest rate  $r^D$ , while the GDP grows at a higher rate of  $x$ . If we wait long enough, the government debt/GDP ratio will decline to zero, making it easy for the government to eventually raise a one-time tax as a small fraction of the GDP and pay down the debt.

It is also straightforward to consider bond convenience yields in this calculation. In the absence of convenience yields, the debt return is equal to the risk-free rate,  $r^D = r$ . In the presence of convenience yields, the government is able to finance its debt at a rate lower than the risk-free rate  $\rho$ :

$$
r ^ {D} = \rho - \lambda .
$$

Then, Eq. (8.4) becomes

$$
\frac {s}{y} = \frac {d}{y} (\rho - \lambda - x),
$$

which implies that, in the case of  $r^D > x$ , a higher convenience yield  $\lambda$  lowers the required surplus/GDP ratio to sustain a given debt/GDP ratio.

# 8.A.1 Limitations to the Backward-Looking Approach

There are limits to what we learn from the backward-looking approach, which is a statement of the past. The future may or may not be the same. Specifically, consider the task of predicting the market value of debt in the next period  $t + 1$ , which follows

$$
D _ {t + 1} = - S _ {t + 1} + D _ {t} \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}),
$$

and therefore depends on not only the future government surplus  $S_{t+1}$ , but also the future debt return  $R_{t+1}^{D}$ . While the future surplus may be predicted following some well-defined legislative or budgetary rules, it is much harder to predict the future debt return, which depends on the investors' expectation of the government's fiscal conditions in the more distant future and their risk appetite. Similarly, back in the personal loan example in Table 8.1, if the lender is unsure of the borrower's future income and therefore has doubt about the borrower's ability to repay the loan, then, the market value of the outstanding loan needs to adjust to reflect this uncertainty.

In this sense, the law of motion for government debt is less "mechanical" than the law of motion for economic quantities such as the capital stock. The capital stock depends on depreciation and investments, and large adjustments in these economic quantities are subject to adjustment cost. Adjustments in the debt return, in comparison, reflect changes in investors' expectations and risk preferences which

can be much faster and greater. As a result, in the next section we turn to the valuation tools developed in finance, which are exactly about understanding how asset prices respond to uncertainty in the future.

# 8.B Forward-Looking Valuation

As in the backward-looking accounting, here we also start with Eq. (8.1). We consider a useful special case in which the government issues nominal bonds up to tenor  $H$ . So, the market value of the entire government debt portfolio can be expressed as

$$
D _ {t} = \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h),
$$

where  $Q_{t}(h)$  is the quantity of outstanding nominal zero-coupon bonds of maturity  $h$  in period  $t$ , and  $P_{t}(h)$  is the price for the  $h$ -year bonds in period  $t$ . We note that the one-period nominal risk-free debt is a special case with  $H = 1$ ,  $Q_{t}(1) = B_{t + 1}$ , and  $P_{t}(1) = \exp(-i_{t})$ .

These bonds may be defaultable. When government default does not happen in period  $t$ , the one-period government budget condition becomes

$$
D _ {t - 1} \exp \left(R _ {t} ^ {D}\right) = \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t - 1} (h) P _ {t} (h - 1) = S _ {t} + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h). \tag {8.5}
$$

When default happens in period  $t$ , all existing bonds from period  $t$  are wiped out. After the default, the government may be able to issue new bonds at prices  $P_{t}(h)$  in this current period, as well as in future periods:

$$
0 = S _ {t} + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h).
$$

This time, we iterate forward these equations, and derive the following intertemporal government budget condition. We use  $M_{t,t+k}$  to denote the multi-horizon nominal SDF from period  $t$  to period  $t + k$ .

Proposition 8.2. Even when the government debt is defaultable, the market value of government debt is equal to the present value of future government surpluses plus a transversality term:

$$
D _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) S _ {t + k} \right] + \lim  _ {k \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) D _ {t + k} \right]. \tag {8.6}
$$

Using the one-period budget constraint (8.1) again, we can also express

It is a simple extension to consider partial default, which we do not consider in this note.

this intertemporal government budget condition as

$$
D _ {t - 1} \exp \left(R _ {t} ^ {D}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) S _ {t + k} \right] + \lim  _ {k \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) D _ {t + k} \right]. \tag {8.7}
$$

The proof is given in Appendix A.31. Eq. (8.6) and (8.7) are equivalent ways to express the same intertemporal government budget condition. Eq. (8.6) equates the end-of-period market value of the government debt after issuances and repayments,  $D_{t}$ , to the ex-dividend present value of future surpluses and the transversality term, whereas Eq. (8.7) equates the beginning-of-period market value of the government debt,  $D_{t-1}\exp(R_t^D)$ , to the cum-dividend present value of future surpluses and the transversality term. Our results can be expressed in either convention we use. To avoid confusion, we stick to the first expression in this section.

If the transversality condition holds, i.e.,

$$
\lim  _ {k \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) D _ {t + k} ] = 0, \tag {8.8}
$$

then, we can express this intertemporal government budget condition (8.6) as

$$
D _ {t} = P _ {t} ^ {T} - P _ {t} ^ {G}, \tag {8.9}
$$

where  $D_{t}$  on the left-hand side is the market value of debt at the end of period  $t$ , and  $P_{t}^{T}$  and  $P_{t}^{G}$  on the right-hand side denote the present value of current and future tax revenues and government spending:

$$
P _ {t} ^ {T} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) T _ {t + k} \right],
$$

$$
P _ {t} ^ {G} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) G _ {t + k} \right].
$$

We refer to the present value of future government surpluses  $P_{t}^{T} - P_{t}^{G}$  as the fiscal backing. When the transversality condition holds, the fiscal backing determines the market valuation of the aggregate government debt portfolio.

This equation provides a forward-looking valuation of the government debt, which determines its value based on the expectation of future government surpluses and their discount rates. In comparison, the backward-looking accounting formula (8.2) accounts for the debt value based on the history of past government surpluses and realized debt returns. As in the personal loan example we considered at the beginning of this chapter, these two approaches are both valid and provide complementary perspectives on the valuation of government debt.

We offer three economic interpretations of this forward-looking relationship. First, it is worth noting that the cash flow stream of government surpluses  $S_{t}$  can be replicated by simply trading the government debt: if an investor buys all new government debt issuances and receives the government debt coupons and repayments, then, his or her cash flow is exactly equal to the government surpluses. As such, Proposition 8.2 shows that the aggregate government debt portfolio can be priced by any investors who can trade this strategy, even when the markets are incomplete and there are multiple SDFs that price the tradable asset space.

In fact, for investors who can trade government debt, they should agree on the valuation of government debt even when they have different SDFs. For investors  $i$  and  $j$  with SDFs  $M_{t,t+k}^{i}$  and  $M_{t,t+k}^{j}$ , respectively, we have

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k} ^ {i}\right) \left(T _ {t + k} - G _ {t + k}\right) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k} ^ {j}\right) \left(T _ {t + k} - G _ {t + k}\right) \right]. \tag {8.10}
$$

If this equality does not hold, these two investors should trade with each other using the government debt portfolio.

Second, this result implies that, in order to back up  $D_{t}$  dollars' worth of debt, the government needs to generate a positive present value from its future primary surpluses. Conversely, when the present value of primary surpluses increases in period  $t$ , the government debt appreciates in value and generates a higher return  $R_{t}^{D}$ . That is, Eq. (8.9) implies

$$
D _ {t - 1} \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1}\right) \left[ \exp \left(R _ {t} ^ {D}\right) \right] = \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1}\right) \left[ \left(P _ {t} ^ {T} + T _ {t}\right) - \left(P _ {t} ^ {G} + G _ {t}\right) \right],
$$

where  $\exp(R_t^D)$  denotes the holding return of the aggregate government bond portfolio:

$$
\exp (R _ {t} ^ {D}) = \frac {\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t - 1} (h) P _ {t} (h - 1)}{\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t - 1} (h) P _ {t - 1} (h)} = \frac {D _ {t} + S _ {t}}{D _ {t - 1}}.
$$

Third, if the transversality condition holds, we can express Eq. (8.6) as

$$
D _ {t} = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) \right] \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ S _ {t + k} \right] + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} c o v _ {t} \left(\exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right), S _ {t + k}\right),
$$

which implies that the fiscal backing can be created either by running a higher government surpluses on average (i.e., higher  $\mathbb{E}_t[S_{t+k}]$ ), or by making government surpluses more countercyclical (i.e., higher  $cov_t(\exp(M_{t,t+k}), S_{t+k}))$ . The latter channel creates fiscal backing by conditionally generating higher cash flows in high marginal utility

states, which provides an insurance to the debtholders—a point we will revisit in our discussion of the fiscal trade-off in the risk domain.

Finally, we make two more technical observations. First, if the transversality condition (8.8) holds, the intertemporal government budget condition (8.6) for all periods has the same information content as the one-period budget constraint (8.1) for all periods. Specifically, imposing the intertemporal budget constraints in two adjacent periods implies the one-period budget constraint in the first period. To see this, simply apply  $\mathbb{E}_t[\exp (M_{t,t + 1})(\cdot)]$  to both sides of the second period's intertemporal condition, and then subtract from the first period's intertemporal condition to obtain the first period's one-period budget constraint.

Second, the intertemporal government budget condition can also be expressed in real terms. For example, we can rewrite Eq. (8.6) be expressed as

$$
d _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (m _ {t, t + k}) s _ {t + k} \right] + \lim  _ {k \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t, t + k}) d _ {t + k} ],
$$

where  $d_{t}$  and  $s_{t}$  are the real market value of government debt and the real primary surplus, and  $m_{t,t+k}$  is the real SDF which is related to the nominal SDF via Eq. (6.1).

# 8.B.1 Incorporating the Convenience Yields

We can further generalize this result with convenience yields. The convenience yield  $\lambda_t(h)$  is the expected returns on government bonds of maturity  $h$  that investors are willing to forgo. As in Chapter 4, the convenience yield is a wedge in the standard Euler equation:

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t} (h)) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t + 1}) \frac {P _ {t + 1} (h - 1)}{P _ {t} (h)} \right].
$$

The presence of the convenience yield implies that the government can finance its debt at a lower interest rate or a higher bond price, which increases the amount it can raise from debt issuance. This additional revenue from debt issuance is a form of seigniorage revenue, which we formally define as the bond market value  $Q_{t}(h)P_{t}(h)$  times the Euler equation wedge  $1 - \exp (-\lambda_{t}(h))$ , summed across all maturities  $h$ :

$$
K _ {t} \stackrel {{\text {d e f}}} {{=}} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) \left(1 - \exp \left(- \lambda_ {t} (h)\right)\right).
$$

When the convenience yields are identical for bonds of all maturities, i.e.,  $\lambda_t(h) = \lambda_t$ , then, we can simplify this seigniorage revenue

as the product between the market value of debt and the convenience yield level:

$$
K _ {t} = D _ {t} (1 - \exp (- \lambda_ {t})) \approx D _ {t} \lambda_ {t},
$$

where the approximation holds when the convenience yield  $\lambda_{t}$  is small.

This seigniorage revenue contributes to the government's income in addition to the primary surpluses and results in a higher fiscal backing. In the following proposition, we generalize Proposition 8.2 to incorporate the convenience yields.

Proposition 8.3. When there is convenience yield on government debt and possible government default, the market value of government debt is equal to the present value of future government surpluses and future seigniorage revenues plus a transversality term:

$$
D _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) S _ {t + k} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) K _ {t + k} \right] + \lim  _ {k \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) D _ {t + k} \right]. \tag {8.11}
$$

The proof is given in Appendix A.32. In this formula, while the sum of government surpluses starts from period  $t + 1$  to back up the debt outstanding at the end of period  $t$ , the sum of the seigniorage revenues starts from period  $t$ . This is because the seigniorage revenue  $K_{t}$  results from the fact that the government can pay back its debt in period  $t + 1$  with a lower interest, which is tied to  $\lambda_{t}(h)$ , the convenience yield in period  $t$ . Since these additional proceeds are due to investors' willingness to accept lower returns to hold the government debt in exchange for its liquidity and safety, we can also interpret the seigniorage revenue term as the valuation of the government debt's service flows. When the service flows become more valuable, the value of government debt appreciates and results in a higher return  $R_{t}^{D}$ .

# 8.B.2 Fiscal Trade-Off in the Risk Domain

The intertemporal government budget condition also has implications for how the government trades off the risk that it transfers to the taxpayers and the debtholders. Recall that the cum-dividend debt return is

$$
\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}) = \frac {\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {\infty} P _ {t + 1} (h - 1) Q _ {t} (h)}{\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {\infty} P _ {t} (h) Q _ {t} (h)}.
$$

Similarly, we can regard the claims to tax revenues and government spending as financial securities, and define their cum-dividend

returns as

$$
\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {T}) = \frac {P _ {t + 1} ^ {T} + T _ {t + 1}}{P _ {t} ^ {T}},
$$

$$
\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {G}) = \frac {P _ {t + 1} ^ {G} + G _ {t + 1}}{P _ {t} ^ {G}}.
$$

Moreover, if we regard the equity market return  $\exp(R_{t+1}^{M})$  as a systematic risk factor, we can define the debt beta, the tax beta, and the spending beta as

$$
\beta_ {t} ^ {D} = \frac {\operatorname {c o v} _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}) , \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}))}{\operatorname {v a r} _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}))},
$$

$$
\beta_ {t} ^ {T} = \frac {c o v _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {T}) , \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}))}{v a r _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}))},
$$

$$
\beta_ {t} ^ {G} = \frac {c o v _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {G}) , \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}))}{v a r _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}))}.
$$

Then, we obtain the following result characterizing these claims' expected returns and systematic risk exposures [Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan, 2020b].

Proposition 8.4. (a) The expected returns on the aggregate government debt portfolio, the claim to tax revenues, and the claim to government spending satisfy

$$
\frac {D _ {t} + P _ {t} ^ {G}}{D _ {t}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {T}) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}) \right] + \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{D _ {t}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {G}) \right].
$$

(b) The betas of the aggregate government debt portfolio, the claim to tax revenues, and the claim to government spending satisfy

$$
\frac {D _ {t} + P _ {t} ^ {G}}{D _ {t}} \beta_ {t} ^ {T} = \beta_ {t} ^ {D} + \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{D _ {t}} \beta_ {t} ^ {G}.
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.33. This proposition resembles the Modigliani-Miller Theorem in corporate finance, which states that, within a firm, its equity is a levered claim on the underlying asset. As a result, the return beta and the risk premium on the firm asset are equal to the weighted average of those on the firm's equity and debt claims:

$$
\frac {D + E}{D} \beta_ {t} ^ {A} = \beta_ {t} ^ {D} + \frac {E}{D} \beta_ {t} ^ {E},
$$

where  $D$  is the market value of debt and  $E$  is the ex-dividend market value of equity. Similarly, the government holds the claim to tax revenues and splits up these cash flows to debtholders and recipients of government spending. As a result, the return beta and the risk

premium on the tax claim are equal to the weighted average of those on the government debt and the spending claim.

This result implies a very tight constraint on how the government insures taxpayers and debtholders. To simplify the argument, we assume that the taxpayers both pay tax and receive the government spending as a transfer.

If the government decides to make its debt risk-free, which implies a zero debt beta  $\beta_t^D = 0$ , then, Proposition 8.4 implies

$$
\beta_ {t} ^ {T} = \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{D _ {t} + P _ {t} ^ {G}} \beta_ {t} ^ {G}.
$$

With a positive amount of outstanding debt, i.e.,  $D_{t} > 0$ , and a procyclical tax claim, i.e.,  $\beta_{t}^{T} > 0$ , then, the spending beta has to be even higher than the tax beta. That is, the government spending has to be more procyclical than the tax revenue in order to manufacture risk-free government debt. In other words, the risk-free debt is manufactured by transferring more risk to the taxpayers.

Conversely, insuring taxpayers by lowering tax or raising government spending in bad times implies high debt beta or low spending beta, which renders the government debt risky by requiring a high debt beta.

Taking a step back, this trade-off between insuring the taxpayers and insuring the debtholders is a manifestation of the resource constraint. There are only so many resources that the government can use during a recession. If it allocates these resources to the debtholders, then the debt value is preserved in recessions at the expense of the taxpayers. Conversely, if it allocates these resources to the taxpayers, then the debt value has to go down in recessions.

Moreover, we can extend this trade-off result to the case of convenience yields. In this case, the debt return can be expressed as a weighted average of the returns on the tax, spending, and seigniorage claims:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}\right) = \frac {D _ {t + 1} + S _ {t + 1}}{D _ {t}} = \frac {P _ {t + 1} ^ {T} + P _ {t + 1} ^ {K} + K _ {t + 1} - P _ {t + 1} ^ {G} + T _ {t + 1} - G _ {t + 1}}{D _ {t}} \\ = \frac {P _ {t} ^ {T}}{D _ {t}} \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {T}\right) + \frac {P _ {t} ^ {K}}{D _ {t}} \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {K}\right) - \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{D _ {t}} \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {G}\right), \tag {8.12} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $P_{t}^{K}$  denotes the ex-dividend present value of the seigniorage claim.

While this formula looks like a simple extension of the case without convenience yield, there is a subtle difference. Proposition 8.3 implies that

$$
D _ {t} = P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} + K _ {t} - P _ {t} ^ {G}.
$$

We have an additional  $K_{t}$  term since the sum of the seigniorage revenue starts from  $t = 0$  in the intertemporal government budget condition (8.11), which means that, unlike the case without convenience yields, the weights on the right-hand side of Eq. (8.12) do not sum up to 1:

$$
\frac {P _ {t} ^ {T}}{D _ {t}} + \frac {P _ {t} ^ {K}}{D _ {t}} - \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{D _ {t}} = 1 - \frac {K _ {t}}{D _ {t}} <   1.
$$

This is a feature, not a bug. Suppose the tax, spending, and seigniorage claims all have the same discount rate. Then, as long as the weights sum up to 1, a linear combination of these claims also has the same discount rate. The presence of the bond convenience yield introduces a "missing weight," which allows the debt to have a lower discount rate  $R_{t+1}^{D}$ . More precisely, we can write Eq. (8.12) as

$$
\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}) \left(1 + \frac {K _ {t}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}}\right) = \frac {P _ {t} ^ {T}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {T}) + \frac {P _ {t} ^ {K}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {K}) - \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {G}).
$$

On the left-hand side, the debt return is adjusted by a factor of  $K_{t} / (P_{t}^{T} + P_{t}^{K} - P_{t}^{G})$ , which reflects the size of the convenience yield. On the right-hand side, the weights are normalized to sum up to 1. When the convenience yield is higher and generates a high seigniorage revenue  $K_{t}$ , the debt return  $R_{t+1}^{D}$  can be lower than the weighted average of the tax, spending, and seigniorage returns.

Proposition 8.5. (a) The expected returns on the aggregate government debt portfolio, the claims to tax revenues, government spending, and seigniorage revenues satisfy

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}\right) \right] \left(1 + \frac {K _ {t}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}}\right) = \frac {P _ {t} ^ {T}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {T}\right) \right] + \frac {P _ {t} ^ {K}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {K}\right) \right] \\ - \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {G}\right) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

(b) The betas of the aggregate government debt portfolio and the claims to tax revenues, government spending, and seigniorage revenues satisfy

$$
\beta_ {t} ^ {D} \left(1 + \frac {K _ {t}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}}\right) = \frac {P _ {t} ^ {T}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \beta_ {t} ^ {T} + \frac {P _ {t} ^ {K}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \beta_ {t} ^ {K} - \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \beta_ {t} ^ {G}.
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.34. Part (a) shows that the expected return on the debt is tied to a weighted average of the expected returns on the tax, spending, and seigniorage claims. However, the presence of convenience yield introduces a wedge that is increasing in the convenience yield and hence the seigniorage revenue  $K_{t}$ : a higher convenience yield allows the discount rate on the debt to be lower than the weighted average.

However, on the risk domain, we still obtain a tight constraint on how the government insures the taxpayers and the debtholders. As a special case, suppose the government commits to keeping its debt risk-free, i.e.,  $\beta_t^D = 0$ . Then, part (b) simplifies to

$$
0 = \frac {P _ {t} ^ {T}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \beta_ {t} ^ {T} + \frac {P _ {t} ^ {K}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \beta_ {t} ^ {K} - \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \beta_ {t} ^ {G},
$$

which means that a higher convenience yield per se does not help with insuring the taxpayers. Instead, a countercyclical convenience yield is needed to allow the government to impose lower taxes and insure the taxpayers in high marginal utility states.

What we derived above is a positive statement of the trade-off that the government faces between insuring the taxpayers and insuring the debtholders. This trade-off in itself is silent about what is optimal. We need to develop specific models of the government's objective function and the taxpayers' and the bondholders' preferences to answer the normative question. In some cases, this normative question is not only economic but also political. As Keynes [1926] noted in the context of France's debt payments in the interbellum period,

The level of the franc is going to be settled in the long run, not by speculation or the balance of trade, or even the outcome of the Ruhr adventure, but by the proportion of his earned income which the French taxpayer will permit to be taken from him to pay the claims of the French rentier...

Now it is obvious that there are two methods of attaining the desired equilibrium. You can increase the burdens on the taxpayer, or you can diminish the claims of the rentier. If you choose the first alternative, taxation will absorb nearly a quarter of the national income of France...

Since this by itself is not enough, your next business—provided you accept my conclusion as to the mind of the French public—is to consider coolly how best to reduce the claims of the rentier. Three methods offer themselves: first, a general capital levy; second, a forced reduction of the rate of interest on the public debt; third, a rise of prices which would reduce the real value of the rentier's money claims.

# 8.B.3 Connecting the Aggregate to the Disaggregate Bond Prices

Propositions 8.2 and 8.3 describe the valuation  $D_{t}$  of the entire government debt portfolio, defined as the sum of individual government bonds' values:

$$
D _ {t} = \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h).
$$

Let us first consider the determination of these individual government bonds' values. We continue to assume that the government bonds are denominated in local currencies, promise nominal payments, and could potentially default. As the government bonds are

defaultable, their yields are not necessarily the same as the nominal risk-free rates, which we denote by  $i_t(h)$ . Let us use  $i_t^{Treas}(h)$  to denote the yield of the government debt with maturity  $h$ , which satisfies

$$
i _ {t} ^ {\text {T r e a s}} (h) \stackrel {{\text {d e f}}} {{=}} - \frac {1}{h} \log P _ {t} (h).
$$

This government debt yield can be decomposed into a risk-free component, a default spread component, and a convenience yield component:

$$
i _ {t} ^ {T r e a s} (h) = \rho_ {t} (h) + \delta_ {t} (h) - c _ {t} (h),
$$

where the risk-free component reflects the benchmark discount rate implied from the SDF:

$$
\rho_ {t} (h) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} - \frac {1}{h} \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t, t + h}) ],
$$

the default spread component captures the risk-neutral expectation of sovereign default,

$$
\delta_ {t} (h) \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} - \frac {1}{h} \left(\log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t, t + h}) \prod_ {j = 1} ^ {h} (1 - \chi_ {t + j} ^ {i}) \right] - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t, t + h}) ]\right),
$$

and the convenience yield component captures the wedge between the bond yield and the yield of a hypothetical bond with the same default spread but no Euler equation wedge [Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan, 2020c]:

$$
c _ {t} (h) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {1}{h} \left(\log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + h}\right) \prod_ {j = 1} ^ {h} \left(1 - \chi_ {t + j} ^ {i}\right) \exp \left(\lambda_ {t + j - 1} (h - j + 1)\right) \right] - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + h}\right) \prod_ {j = 1} ^ {h} \left(1 - \chi_ {t + j} ^ {i}\right) \right]\right).
$$

Moreover, while the risk-free rate is risk-free in local currency units, it could carry a currency risk premium. For the case of  $h = 1$ , according to Section 1.B applied to nominal exchange rates  $\mathcal{E}_t$  and interest rates  $\rho_t$  and  $\rho_t^*$ , under joint normality,

$$
\rho_ {t} = \rho_ {t} ^ {*} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta \mathcal {E} _ {t + 1} ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta \mathcal {E} _ {t + 1}) - c o v _ {t} (M _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta \mathcal {E} _ {t + 1}),
$$

which implies that the nominal home risk-free rate  $\rho_{t}$  relative to a foreign benchmark  $\rho_{t}^{*}$  is decreasing in the home currency's expected nominal appreciation  $\mathbb{E}_t[\Delta \mathcal{E}_{t + 1}]$ , and increasing in the home currency's risk premium  $RP_{t} = -cov_{t}(M_{t + 1}^{*},\Delta \mathcal{E}_{t + 1}) - \frac{1}{2} var_{t}(\Delta \mathcal{E}_{t + 1})$ .<sup>2</sup> As such, government bonds compensate investors for not only credit risk but also exchange rate risk.

How do we connect this determination of individual bond prices to the valuation of the aggregate government debt portfolio? While

2 The longer-term nominal rates have similar expressions that contain the marginal utility growth and the exchange rate movement from period  $t$  to  $t + h$ .

the intertemporal government budget condition in Propositions 8.2 and 8.3 imposes a restriction on the aggregate government debt portfolio, the government can still carve out different types of liabilities subject to this restriction in aggregate. This is again similar to the corporate finance context, in which the company with a certain type of assets can issue different types of equity and debt liabilities subject to the Modigliani-Miller restriction. That said, when the government surpluses and seigniorage revenues fluctuate, the valuation of the individual bonds needs to respond, resulting in changes in any of the risk-free rate  $\rho_{t}$ , the default spread  $\delta_{t}$ , and the convenience yield  $c_{t}$  components.

# 8.C The Transversality Condition

All of our results above rely on the transversality condition (8.8), reproduced below:

$$
\lim _ {k \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) D _ {t + k} \right] = 0,
$$

which states that the discounted value of future government debt has to converge to zero. If this condition does not hold, then, the market value of debt could exceed the present value of government surpluses, and the gap could potentially be infinite. In this section, we provide two perspectives on this condition.

# 8.C.1 The Transversality Condition as Discounted Debt Strip

To evaluate this condition, we may think of a hypothetical financial claim whose payoff at time  $t + k$  is equal to the market value of outstanding government debt in that period. Using the language from the literature that studies dividend strips, we may call this claim the debt strip. Importantly, this debt strip does not pay out the promised payment of a specific debt, but instead pays out the market value of outstanding debt. In other words, holders of this claim are betting on a greater amount of debt outstanding.

In a large class of macro models, the amount of outstanding government debt  $D_{t}$  is cointegrated with the GDP  $Y_{t}$ . The implicit assumption is either that the government manages its debt responsibly and does not allow the size of debt to explode, or that the investors impose discipline so that market value of debt adjusts as the notional amount of borrowing goes up. In either case, the risk premium on the long-term debt strip converges to the risk premium on the long-term GDP claim. Given that the GDP is risky, the risk premium is high enough in many macro models to guarantee that the discounted value of long-term GDP strip converges to zero. As a result, the value

of debt strip also converges to zero, and the transversality condition holds.

# 8.C.2 The Transversality Condition as Household Optimality Condition

The transversality condition is a necessary condition for the optimality of (long-lasting) households' decisions. To derive this result, we consider a set-up similar to the home country in Chapter 1, in which the households maximize expected lifetime utility:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} u (c _ {t}) \right].
$$

Proving the transversality condition in a general way is technically difficult. Here we consider a much narrower class of utility functions, which is adapted from Brock [1982]: the utility function  $u(c)$  is not only monotone increasing in  $c$  and concave, but also bounded from below. Without loss of generality, we can normalize the utility level and assume  $u(c) \geq 0$ . For simplicity in exposition, we also assume that the price level is fixed, so that the nominal risk-free debt is also risk-free in real terms. For interested readers, Ekeland and Scheinkman [1986] provides a more general characterization.

The households can trade the outstanding government debt. Let  $d_{t}$  denote the households' government debt portfolio and let  $\exp(r_{t}^{D})$  denote its nominal return.

$$
w _ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} c _ {t} + d _ {t} = y _ {t} + d _ {t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {D}\right).
$$

The first-order condition (Euler equation) w.r.t.  $d_{t - 1}$  is given by

$$
u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t - 1}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \delta u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {d}\right) \right]. \tag {8.13}
$$

The households are also subject to a no-short-sale constraint  $d_t \geq 0$  for all  $t$ . In general, we need a lower bound on the households' asset position, which is not necessarily zero, so that the households cannot borrow an infinite amount of money for consumption.

We define the households' value function in period  $o$  as

$$
\psi (w _ {t}, t) = \max  \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {s} u (c _ {s}) \right],
$$

which can be shown to be concave and differentiable [Benveniste and Scheinkman, 1979, Brock, 1982].

Given this set-up, let us first consider the special case in which the households have a finite horizon  $T$ . Then, in the last period, it is in the households' interest to consume all of their savings instead of

leaving money on the table, as the remaining wealth will be wasted. Moreover, the no-short-sale constraint also implies that the households cannot finish with negative wealth. Therefore, we can express the finite-period transversality condition as

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {T} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {T}) d _ {T} \right] = 0.
$$

The infinite-horizon case has a similar interpretation, though its derivation is more complicated. The following proposition shows that the transversality condition is a necessary condition for the optimality of households' decisions.

Proposition 8.6. Assume that the value function satisfies  $\lim_{t\to \infty}\psi (w_t,t) = 0$ . Then, the optimal solution  $\{c_t\}_{t = 0}^{\infty},\{d_t\}_{t = 0}^{\infty}$  to the households' problem implies the Euler equation (8.13) and the transversality condition

$$
\lim _ {t \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) d _ {t} \right] = 0.
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.35. This proposition shows that the households optimally choose not to "leave money on the table" in the infinite horizon, which means to increase their savings  $d_{t}$  in the government bond portfolio at a rate higher than their discount rate  $\delta^{t}u^{\prime}(c_{t})$ . The households do not borrow an infinite amount of money by short-selling the government debt, either, which is ruled out by the no-short-sale constraint. This result emphasizes that the transversality condition is usually imposed by the households' optimal decision, just like the Euler equation (8.13).

Moreover, while this set-up considers only one type of assets in which households can deposit their savings, the extension to multiple assets is straight-forward. Let  $a_{t}$  denote the households' total savings and  $d_{t}$  denote the households' holdings of one asset that we denote as the government debt. Then, our derivation shows that the transversality condition holds at the portfolio level:

$$
\lim _ {t \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) a _ {t} \right] = 0.
$$

Now, suppose the households' transversality condition for the government debt is violated, i.e.,

$$
\lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) d _ {t} \right] > 0.
$$

This implies that the households' holdings in other assets are negative in the infinite horizon, i.e.,

$$
\lim _ {t \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) (a _ {t} - d _ {t}) \right] <   0,
$$

which violates the no-short-sale constraint. So, the transversality condition also holds at the level of individual assets.

Does the presence of bond convenience yields affects the transversality condition? Following Section 4.A, we assume that the households also derive utility directly from holding the government bonds. The utility function is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(u \left(c _ {t}\right) + v _ {t} \left(d _ {t}\right)\right) \right].
$$

We use  $\lambda_{t}$  to denote the convenience yields at time  $t$ , which, as we see in Section 4.A, is determined by the ratio between the marginal utility of bond holding and the marginal utility of consumption:

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = 1 - \frac {v _ {t} ^ {\prime} (d _ {t})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})}.
$$

Proposition 8.7. In the presence of the bond convenience yield, the optimal solution  $\{c_t\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$ ,  $\{d_t\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$  to the households' problem implies the Euler equation (8.13) and the transversality condition

$$
\lim _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) d _ {t} \exp (- \lambda_ {t}) \right] = 0.
$$

When the convenience yield  $\lambda_{t}$  is bounded, we recover the original transversality condition:

$$
\lim _ {t \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) d _ {t} \right] = 0.
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.36. When the bond convenience yield  $\lambda_{t}$  is bounded, we recover the original transversality condition in the presence of the bond convenience yield. In other words, while the bond convenience yield can increase the fiscal backing of the government debt as we show in Proposition 8.3, it does not affect the transversality condition.

# 8.C.3 When Does the Transversality Condition Fail?

The recent literature sees a revival of the idea that the transversality condition may fail under certain conditions, which is used to justify why the market value of government debt could exceed the government's fiscal backing, i.e., the present value of its primary surpluses plus additional seigniorage revenue.

First, in overlapping generation (OLG) models, there are no long-lived investors who impose the transversality condition as an optimality condition as we discussed in Proposition 8.6 and Proposition 8.7. Then, the valuation of the government debt, which is usually the only long-lasting asset in the economy, could be infinite. Blanchard [2019] offers one such example.

Second, the transversality condition can fail when evaluated at the "aggregate SDF" in incomplete markets where the representative agent does not exist. Brunnermeier, Merkel, and Sannikov [2022] present one example, in which individual households face idiosyncratic risks, and the transversality condition still holds at their individual SDFs and their actual cash flows from trading the government debt. In fact, not only does each individual household's SDF look different because of their idiosyncratic risks, their cash flows from trading the government debt is also different from the aggregate primary surpluses because they dynamically buy and sell government debt in response to their idiosyncratic shocks. These cash flows allow the individual households to partially hedge against their idiosyncratic shocks, and can be therefore interpreted as service flows.

# 8.D An Example Economy

The results we derived so far are general. Next, we illustrate their economic meanings in the context of a simple example economy, which largely follows from Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan [2020b]. In this economy, we only consider one-period risk-free debt. Yet, the government surplus and the quantity of government debt are risky and cointegrated with GDP.

Let  $Y_{t}$  denote the nominal GDP. The GDP growth is i.i.d. and permanent:

$$
\Delta \log Y _ {t + 1} = X + \sigma \varepsilon_ {t + 1},
$$

where  $\varepsilon_{t + 1}$  denotes the innovation to GDP growth that is i.i.d. normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation one.

The log nominal SDF is driven by the same GDP shock

$$
M _ {t, t + 1} = - i - \frac {1}{2} \gamma^ {2} - \gamma \varepsilon_ {t + 1},
$$

which implies that a lower GDP growth leads to a higher marginal utility. By the Euler equation for risk-free debt, the one-period log risk-free rate is a constant:  $R^{f} = i$ .

Given these specifications, the present value of a GDP strip  $k$  periods from now is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) Y _ {t + k} ] = \exp \left(k (X - i + \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} - \gamma \sigma)\right) Y _ {t},
$$

which converges to zero as  $k \to \infty$  if the discount rate is higher than the GDP growth rate, i.e.,

$$
i + \gamma \sigma > X + \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2}.
$$

We note that the discount rate is the benchmark risk-free rate  $i$  implied from the SDF plus the risk premium term  $\gamma \sigma$ . The growth rate is the log growth rate  $X$  plus the Jensen's term  $\frac{1}{2} \sigma^2$ .

We assume that the government commits to issuing one-period risk-free debt. The government also commits to a simple fiscal policy, with a constant spending/GDP ratio  $\bar{\gamma} = G_t / Y_t$  and a constant debt/GDP ratio  $\bar{\delta} = D_t / Y_t$ .

Then, the government budget constraint (8.1) implies a countercyclical process for the surplus/GDP ratio:

$$
\frac {S _ {t}}{Y _ {t}} = \frac {T _ {t} - G _ {t}}{Y _ {t}} = - \frac {D _ {t}}{Y _ {t}} + \exp (R ^ {f}) \frac {D _ {t - 1}}{Y _ {t - 1}} \frac {Y _ {t - 1}}{Y _ {t}} = - \bar {\delta} \left(1 - \exp \left(- (X - i + \sigma \varepsilon_ {t})\right)\right).
$$

This result implies that  $\partial (S_t / Y_t) / \partial \varepsilon_t < 0$ . Therefore, to insure the debtholders by keeping its debt risk-free, the government must generate counter-cyclical primary surpluses. In particular, when the GDP declines ( $\varepsilon_t < 0$ ) in recessions, the tax revenue needs to increase as a fraction of GDP or the government spending needs to decrease. The magnitude of the required counter-cyclical response in primary surpluses is increasing in the debt/GDP ratio  $\bar{\delta}$ .

# 8.D.1 The Transversality Condition

We can evaluate the transversality condition in this fully specified model. In particular, we can show that if the risk premium is high enough to guarantee a finite valuation on the GDP claim, then, the transversality condition holds:

$$
\lim  _ {k \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) D _ {t + k} \right] = \lim  _ {k \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \bar {\delta} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) Y _ {t + k} \right] = 0.
$$

Given the transversality condition holds, the government debt value is the sum of the values of the surplus strips:

$$
D _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) S _ {t + k} \right] = \bar {\delta} Y _ {t},
$$

which confirms the assumption that the debt/GDP ratio is a constant.

# 8.D.2 Risks and Risk Premia

How do we reconcile the observation that the government surplus  $S_{t}$  and the market value of government debt  $D_{t}$  are both stochastic with the observation that the debt is risk-free? When the transversality condition is satisfied, the debt return innovation reflects news about the present discounted value of future government surpluses:

$$
D _ {t} \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t}\right) \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}\right) = \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t}\right) \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t + 1, t + j}\right) S _ {t + j} \right].
$$

When the debt is risk-free, there is no uncertainty about the debt return:  $(\mathbb{E}_{t + 1} - \mathbb{E}_t)\exp (R_{t + 1}^D) = 0$ . Then, there is no news about the present value of current and future surpluses; technically, we can say that the present value of current and future surpluses in period  $t + 1$  is measurable in period  $t$ :

$$
\left(\mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t}\right) \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (M _ {t + 1, t + j}) S _ {t + j} \right] = \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t}\right) \left[ D _ {t + 1} + S _ {t + 1} \right] = 0.
$$

In other words, the government surplus  $S_{t+1}$  is engineered such that it exactly offsets the variation in the market value of government debt  $D_{t+1}$ , which allows the debt to offer a constant risk-free return. However, as both government debt strip  $D_{t+1}$  and surpluses  $S_{t+1}$  are stochastic, their discount rates need to reflect their risk premia. In particular, as both government surplus and the debt strip is cointegrated with the GDP, the long-term surplus claim or debt claim has the same risk premium as the GDP risk premium.

# 8.D.3 The  $r <   g$  Case

A particularly interesting case in this model is when the risk-free rate is lower than the average GDP growth rate. In our notation,  $i < X$ . In this case, if the Jensen's term  $\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2$  is small enough so that  $i + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 < X$ , then, the government can sustain deficits on average:

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \frac {S _ {t}}{Y _ {t}} \right] = - \bar {\delta} \left(1 - \exp \left\{- X + i + \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} \right\}\right) <   0.
$$

That said, when the fundamental shock is negative enough  $(X - i < -\sigma \varepsilon_{t})$ , the government still needs to run a primary surplus.

Even though the government runs a deficit on average, the transversality condition can be satisfied if the risk premium  $\gamma \sigma$  on the output claim is large enough:

$$
i + \gamma \sigma > X + \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2}.
$$

In this case, discounting growing surpluses and future debt at the risk-free rate  $i < X$  would not produce the right answer for the valuation of the current debt.

However, this is not a free lunch: the beta constraint characterized by Proposition 8.4 still binds: in order to keep debt risk-free, the government needs to raise taxes or lower spending in high marginal utility states.

In other words, the average deficits reflect an insurance premium that the government earns by extracting countercyclical cash flows from the taxpayers. This risk-based view is very different from the

Blanchard [2019] interpretation of  $r < g$ . From our perspective, it is precisely the positive covariance between the marginal utility and the government surpluses that creates the fiscal backing to manufacture risk-free debt. The  $r < g$  condition is neither necessary nor sufficient to gauge fiscal backing.

# 8.E The Public Debt Valuation Puzzle

When the transversality condition (8.8) holds, the intertemporal government budget condition (8.6) can be expressed as

$$
D _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) T _ {t + k} \right] - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) G _ {t + k} \right]. \tag {8.14}
$$

A fundamental question in finance and macroeconomics is whether the present values of government surpluses on the right-hand side of this equation matches the market value of government debt on the left-hand side. To evaluate the present values on the right-hand side of this equation, we need to know (i) the expected future tax revenues and government spending and (ii) the appropriate discount rates that we assign to these fiscal cash flows. To figure out the expected fiscal cash flows, the data since WW-II suggest that the U.S. on average has similar levels of tax revenue and government spending as fractions of the GDP. If we zoom into the past 15 years, government spending surpassed tax revenue by a large margin. Feeling optimistic, let us assume the U.S. fiscal cash flows will revert to the historical norm over time, which maintains roughly equal tax revenues and government spending on average.

To figure out the appropriate discount rates, we note that the standard risk-free rates are not the right ones to use. Riskier cash flows need to be discounted at higher rates, and the riskiness is determined by how the cash flows comove with the SDF  $M_{t,t+k}$ . Consider the stock market for example. As corporate revenues decline dramatically in high marginal utility states, investors regard stocks as risky assets and therefore require a high compensation to hold them. This is why stocks tend to have higher returns than risk-free bonds over a long enough time period, and why, for the purpose of valuation, corporate cash flows are discounted at much higher rates than the standard interest rates. The data since WW-II suggest that the U.S. tax revenue also exhibits a cyclical behavior, which warrants high discount rates. In comparison, the U.S. government spending is counter-cyclical: it tends to increase during recessions, as unemployment benefits and other welfare payments tend to be higher in the downturns. The government may also decide to spend more on public projects to stimulate the economy. As recessions represent high

marginal utility states, the U.S. government spending deserves lower discount rates.

To put everything together, Eq. (8.14) computes the difference between the expected tax revenue and government spending, discounted at their appropriate discount rates. These cash flows have similar levels on average, but the tax revenue has higher discount rates than the government spending. Then, the present value of the tax cash flows should be lower than that of the spending cash flows, implying a negative present value of government surpluses [Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan, 2019]. This negative valuation of government surpluses on the right-hand side of Eq. (8.14) is at odds with the observed positive market value of government debt on the left-hand side of Eq. (8.14). This gap suggests that the U.S. government may not have enough fiscal backing for its outstanding government debt. We call it the U.S. public debt valuation puzzle.

Related to this puzzle, a salient fact is that the U.S. sovereign credit default swap has high premium since the financial crisis, reflecting a rising risk-adjusted probability of U.S. sovereign default [Chernov, Schmid, and Schneider, 2020, Augustin, Chernov, Schmid, and Song, 2021, Liu, Schmid, and Yaron, 2020]. This analysis is based on a large literature on affine sovereign default models [Pan and Singleton, 2008, Longstaff, Pan, Pedersen, and Singleton, 2011] and a large literature on strategic sovereign default [Eaton and Gersovitz, 1981, Arellano, 2008]. While they are also important issues related to government debt and fiscal sustainability, they are beyond the scope of this note.

So far, we have been working with a very general argument that is consistent with a large number of models with a government and infinitely lived households. More concretely, we can implement this valuation exercise in specific models of cash flows and discount rates. Below, we discuss several valuation techniques that have been used. The results emphasize that the U.S. finances itself at not only favorable rates, reflecting the convenience yield idea discussed in Chapters 4 and 7, but also favorable quantities beyond its fiscal fundamentals.

# 8.E.1 Affine Valuation Models

To evaluate the present value of government surpluses, i.e.,

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) (T _ {t + k} - G _ {t + k}) \right],
$$

we need to model the joint dynamics of the SDF  $M_{t,t + k}$  and the fiscal cash flows  $T_{t + k}$  and  $G_{t + k}$ . Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan [2019] adopts the affine term structure framework, which

has been used in various asset pricing settings to understand stock and bond prices [Duffie and Kan, 1996, Dai and Singleton, 2000, Ang and Piazzesi, 2003, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Verdelhan, 2013, Chernov and Creal, 2023].

Specifically, let  $z_{t}$  denote the vector of state variables demeaned by their average value, which includes the interest rates, stock dividends and price/dividend ratios, and the fiscal cash flows. This vector follows a Gaussian first-order VAR:

$$
z _ {t + 1} = \Psi z _ {t} + u _ {t + 1} = \Psi z _ {t} + \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1},
$$

with the companion matrix  $\Psi$  and homoscedastic innovations  $u_{t + 1}\sim$  i.i.d.  $\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$ . The Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix,  $\Sigma = \Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{\prime}$ , has non-zero elements on and below the diagonal, so that  $\varepsilon_{t + 1}\sim$  i.i.d.  $\mathcal{N}(0,I)$

This VAR setting allows us to model expectations of cash flows. We also choose a flexible SDF that assumes no arbitrage. The log nominal SDF  $M_{t+1}$  is conditionally normal:

$$
M _ {t + 1} = - i _ {t} (1) - \frac {1}{2} \Lambda_ {t} ^ {\prime} \Lambda_ {t} - \Lambda_ {t} ^ {\prime} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}.
$$

The real SDF is  $m_{t+1} = M_{t+1} + \pi_{t+1}$ , which is also conditionally normal. The priced sources of risk are the same as the innovations in the state vector  $\varepsilon_{t+1}$ . These innovations are associated with a market price of risk vector  $\Lambda_t$  of the affine form:

$$
\Lambda_ {t} = \Lambda_ {0} + \Lambda_ {1} z _ {t},
$$

where  $\Lambda_0$  collects the average prices of risk and  $\Lambda_1$  governs the time variation in risk premia. Asset pricing in this model amounts to taking a stance on the market prices of risk in  $\Lambda_0$  and  $\Lambda_1$ .

If the state vector  $z_{t}$  contains the short rate, inflation, GDP growth, the stock dividend/GDP ratio, and the stock price/dividend ratio, this SDF generates affine solutions for the value of the aggregate stock market and the term structure of nominal and real interest rates. We also include fiscal variables in the state vector in order to price the fiscal cash flows.

Let  $i_t(h) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} (1/h) \log P_t(h)$  denote the nominal risk-free rate with maturity  $h$ . For notational convenience, let  $e_i$  denote the vector  $(0, \dots, 1, \dots, 0)'$  that selects the variable corresponding to the short rate, and let  $i_0(1)$  denote the mean value of the short rate. Then,

$$
i _ {t} (1) = e _ {i} ^ {\prime} z _ {t} + i _ {0} (1).
$$

Similarly, let  $e_{\Delta d}, e_x$ , and  $e_{\pi}$  denote vectors that select the variables corresponding to the growth in the dividend/GDP ratio, the real GDP growth, and the inflation, respectively.

Let  $Div_{t}$  denote the stock dividend strip. The value of the dividend strip of horizon  $h$  is defined as

$$
P _ {t} ^ {m} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t, t + h}) D i v _ {t + h} ],
$$

and let  $pd_t^m (h)$  denote the price-dividend ratio of the stock market:

$$
p d _ {t} ^ {m} (h) = \log \left(P _ {t} ^ {m} (h) / D i v _ {t}\right).
$$

Then, the cum-dividend valuation of the stock market can be expressed as

$$
P V _ {t} ^ {m} = D i v _ {t} \sum_ {h = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp \left(A ^ {m} (h + 1) + B ^ {m} (h + 1) ^ {\prime} z _ {t}\right).
$$

Similarly, let  $P_t^\tau(h)$  and  $P_t^g(h)$  denote the price of the tax and spending strips of horizon  $h$ , and let  $pd_t^\tau(h)$  and  $pd_t^g(h)$  denote the price-dividend ratios of the tax and spending strips.

Proposition 8.8. (a) The nominal yield curve is affine in the state vector:

$$
i _ {t} (h) = - \frac {A (h)}{h} - \frac {B (h) ^ {\prime}}{h} z _ {t},
$$

where the coefficients  $A(h)$  and  $B(h)$  satisfy the following recursions:

$$
A (h + 1) = - i _ {0} (1) + A (h) + \frac {1}{2} B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma B (h) - B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0},
$$

$$
B (h + 1) ^ {\prime} = - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + B (h) ^ {\prime} (\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}),
$$

initialized at  $A(0) = 0$  and  $B(0) = \vec{0}$ .

(b) The dividend strip's log price-dividend ratio is also affine in the state vector:

$$
p d _ {t} ^ {m} (h) = A ^ {m} (h) + B ^ {m} (h) ^ {\prime} z _ {t},
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l} A ^ {m} (h + 1) = - i _ {0} (1) + A ^ {m} (h) + x _ {0} + \pi_ {0} + \frac {1}{2} \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) \\ - \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0}, \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
B ^ {m} (h + 1) ^ {\prime} = - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} (\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}).
$$

(c) The tax and spending strips' log price-dividend ratios are also affine in the state vector:

$$
\begin{array}{l} p d _ {t} ^ {\tau} (h) = A ^ {\tau} (h) + B ^ {\tau} (h) ^ {\prime} z _ {t}, \\ p d _ {t} ^ {\mathsf {g}} (h) = A ^ {\mathsf {g}} (h) + B ^ {\mathsf {g}} (h) ^ {\prime} z _ {t}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l} A ^ {\tau} (h + 1) = - i _ {0} (1) + A ^ {\tau} (h) + x _ {0} + \pi_ {0} + \frac {1}{2} \left(B ^ {\tau} (h) + e _ {\Delta \tau} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma \left(B ^ {\tau} (h) + e _ {\Delta \tau} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) \\ - \left(B ^ {\tau} (h) + e _ {\Delta \tau} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0}, \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
B ^ {\tau} (h + 1) ^ {\prime} = - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + \left(B ^ {\tau} (h) + e _ {\Delta \tau} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \left(\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right),
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} A ^ {g} (h + 1) = - i _ {0} (1) + A ^ {g} (h) + x _ {0} + \pi_ {0} + \frac {1}{2} \left(B ^ {g} (h) + e _ {\Delta g} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma \left(B ^ {g} (h) + e _ {\Delta g} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) \\ - \left(B ^ {g} (h) + e _ {\Delta g} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0}, \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
B ^ {g} (h + 1) ^ {\prime} = - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + \left(B ^ {g} (h) + e _ {\Delta g} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} (\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}).
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.37. Our key assumption behind this proposition is that the SDF that prices stocks and bonds can also price the fiscal cash flows. As we discussed earlier in Eq. (8.10), any investors who can trade the aggregate government debt portfolio have to agree on how they price the primary surpluses. Moreover, by assuming that there is no market segmentation between the stock and bond markets, we allow the market price of permanent risks implied from the stock market to also inform the pricing of the fiscal cash flows. In other words, we set up the VAR dynamics to allow cointegration between the GDP, the aggregate stock market dividend, and the government tax and spending strips. As a result, the pricing of the long-term fiscal cash flows is governed by the same market prices of risk that price the long-term stock dividends.

To develop this argument further, let us consider the pricing of infinite-horizon cash flows. In the limit, the nominal yield converges to a certain value, with

$$
B (\infty) ^ {\prime} = B (\infty) ^ {\prime} \Psi - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} - B (\infty) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1},
$$

which implies

$$
B (\infty) ^ {\prime} = - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} \left(I - \left(\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right)\right) ^ {- 1}.
$$

It is useful to interpret  $(\Psi - \Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}\Lambda_{1})$  as the risk-neutral transition matrix, and then the risk loadings of the infinite-horizon bond are given by the loadings of the one-period bond,  $e_i$ , multiplied with the Leontief inverse of  $(\Psi - \Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}\Lambda_{1})$ . The same Leontief inverse operator also appeared in the trade network model in Section 3.C, which captures the effects of higher-order connections in the trade network.

Following this derivation, we can now express the risk premium of the long-term bond and, in a similar way, the risk premia of stock dividend and fiscal cash flows in the infinite horizon.

Proposition 8.9. (a) In the infinite horizon, the long-run nominal yield and

bond expected return are

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} i _ {t} (h) = i _ {0} (1) - \frac {1}{2} B _ {t r a n s} ^ {\prime} \Sigma B _ {t r a n s} + B _ {t r a n s} ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0},
$$

$$
\lim _ {h \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \log P _ {t + 1} (h - 1) - \log P _ {t} (h) ] = i _ {0} (1) - \frac {1}{2} B _ {t r a n s} ^ {\prime} \Sigma B _ {t r a n s} + B _ {t r a n s} ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} + B _ {t r a n s} ^ {\prime} (\Psi - I) z _ {t},
$$

where

$$
B _ {t r a n s} ^ {\prime} \stackrel {d e f} {=} B (\infty) ^ {\prime} = - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} \left(I - \left(\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right)\right) ^ {- 1}.
$$

(b) In the infinite horizon, the expected returns on the dividend, tax, and spending strips are

$$
\lim  _ {h \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \log P _ {t + 1} ^ {m} (h - 1) - \log P _ {t} ^ {m} (h) ] = i _ {0} (1) - \frac {1}{2} B _ {p e r m} ^ {\prime} \Sigma B _ {p e r m} + B _ {p e r m} ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} + B _ {p e r m} ^ {\prime} (\Psi - I) z _ {t} + (e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} z _ {t},
$$

where

$$
B _ {p e r m} ^ {\prime} \stackrel {d e f} {=} (B ^ {m} (\infty) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} = (- e _ {i} + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} \left(I - (\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1})\right) ^ {- 1}.
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.38. In the language of the permanent and transitory SDF components that we discussed in Section 3.D, the SDF we consider here has a permanent component. In the infinite-horizon limit, it prices the cash flows that contain this permanent risk, including the GDP strip, the stock dividend strip, the tax strip, and the spending strip in a coherent fashion, by assigning the same risk premia to these cash flows. The unconditional expected returns of these strips are given by

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} \left[ \log P _ {t + 1} ^ {m} (h - 1) - \log P _ {t} ^ {m} (h) \right] - i _ {0} (1) = B _ {\text {p e r m}} ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} - \frac {1}{2} B _ {\text {p e r m}} ^ {\prime} \Sigma B _ {\text {p e r m}}, \tag {8.15}
$$

which is the product of the risk loadings  $B_{perm}^{\prime}\Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}$  and the market prices of risk  $\Lambda_0$ , plus a second-order Jensen's term.

In contrast, this SDF prices the cash flows that do not have the permanent risk, such as the nominal bond, differently. The unconditional bond risk premia are given by

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} \left[ \log P _ {t + 1} (h - 1) - \log P _ {t} (h) \right] - i _ {0} (1) = B _ {\text {t r a n s}} ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} - \frac {1}{2} B _ {\text {t r a n s}} ^ {\prime} \Sigma B _ {\text {t r a n s}}, \tag {8.16}
$$

which is also the product of the risk loadings  $B_{trans}^{\prime}\Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}$  and the market prices of risk  $\Lambda_0$ , plus a second-order Jensen's term. Note that Eq. (8.16) is a special case of Eq. (8.15), obtained when the cash flow does not grow, i.e., by setting  $e_{\Delta d} + e_x + e_\pi = 0$ .

Figure 8.1 plots the term structures of risk premia for the spending, tax, equity dividend, and GDP claims, and the long-term nominal bonds. The parameterization is taken from the homoscedastic

SDF model in Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan [2019]. In the short run, because the spending claim is countercyclical while the tax and the equity dividend claims are procyclical, the spending claim has a negative risk premium while the tax and the equity dividend claims have positive risk premia. In the long run, because the spending, the tax, and the equity dividend cash flows are all cointegrated with the GDP, they inherit the same risk premium from the permanent component of the GDP, which converges to about  $4\%$  in the limit. In comparison, the nominal bond's payoff is not cointegrated with the GDP, which is why the long-term nominal bonds have a different risk premium close to  $2\%$  in the limit.

Figure 8.1: The Term Structures of Risk Premia.

This result echoes Proposition 3.11 in Section 3.D, which shows that the infinite-horizon risk premia of all cash flows that contain the same permanent component as the SDF will be the same, and reflect the magnitude of the permanent risk in the SDF, i.e.,  $\sigma_P^2$ . In comparison, the infinite-horizon nominal bond's risk premium is only determined by the magnitude of the transitory risk in the SDF, and it will be lower if the risk aversion parameter is big enough.

# 8.E.2 Linearized Intertemporal Budget

Let  $v_{t} = \log (D_{t} / Y_{t})$  denote the log debt/GDP ratio, and let  $sy_{t} = S_{t} / Y_{t}$  denote the surplus/GDP ratio. Let  $\widetilde{r}_{t + 1} = R_{t + 1}^{D} - \pi_{t + 1} - x_{t + 1}$  denote the inflation-and-growth-adjusted debt return. Cochrane [2022] derives a log-linearized return equation implied by the government budget constraint:

$$
\widetilde {r} _ {t + 1} = \kappa v _ {t + 1} - v _ {t} + s _ {t + 1},
$$

where  $\kappa = \exp(-\left(R - x - \pi\right))$  is a constant, and  $s_{t+j} = \kappa \cdot s y_{t+j} / \exp(\bar{v})$  is  $\kappa$  times the primary surplus/GDP ratio scaled by the average debt/GDP ratio. This formula is similar to the log-linearization for stock returns in Campbell and Shiller [1988]:

$$
r _ {t + 1} = \kappa p d _ {t + 1} - p d _ {t} + \Delta d _ {t + 1},
$$

but it allows us to deal with the possibility that the primary surplus  $s_t$  can be negative.

By iterating this equation forward  $T$  times and taking expectations, we obtain

$$
v _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} \kappa^ {j - 1} \left(s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}\right) \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \kappa^ {T} v _ {t + T} ],
$$

which is a linearized version of the intertemporal government budget condition (8.6). It provides a way to evaluate the government debt as a fraction of GDP, i.e.,  $v_{t}$ , based on the expectations of future surpluses  $s_{t+j}$ , future adjusted debt returns  $\widetilde{r}_{t+j}$ , and future debt/GDP level  $v_{t+T}$ .

This relationship holds both ex-ante and ex-post. Without taking expectations, we can express this result as a variance decomposition exercise:

$$
v a r (v _ {t}) = c o v \left(v _ {t}, \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} \kappa^ {j - 1} \left(s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}\right)\right) + c o v (v _ {t}, \kappa^ {T} v _ {t + T}),
$$

which states that the debt/GDP ratio varies only because it predicts future surpluses, future returns, or the future debt/GDP ratio.

If we assume that the transversality condition holds, which in this context means  $\lim_{T\to \infty}\mathbb{E}_t[\kappa^T v_{t + T}] = 0$ , then, we obtain

$$
v _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {\infty} \kappa^ {j - 1} \left(s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}\right) \right].
$$

To implement this model, we could use statistical tools (such as the VAR model or the local projection method) to construct conditional expectations of  $s_{t+j}$  and  $\widetilde{r}_{t+j}$  and build the debt/GDP value from these expectations.

This result helps us gauge whether the transversality condition holds. The conventional wisdom from Bohn [1998] is that a higher debt/GDP ratio  $v_{t}$  is justified by higher surpluses  $s_{t+j}$  in the future. Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan [2021c] use a simple local projection method to construct conditional expectations of not only future surpluses and returns  $(s_{t+j}$  and  $\widetilde{r}_{t+j}$ ), but also future debt/GDP ratio  $(v_{t+j})$ . They find that, after addressing a small-sample bias, the variations in the current debt/GDP ratio are

explained by the variations in the future debt/GDP ratio 10 years later instead of by future fundamentals (i.e., future surpluses and returns) in the next 10 years.

# 8.E.3 Bias in Subjective Expectations

One explanation for the result in Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan [2021c] is biased beliefs. While the econometrician does not expect higher surpluses or lower returns when the debt/GDP ratio rises, bond investors may. More precisely, note that the same linearized decomposition works under the subjective measure, too:

$$
\begin{array}{l} v _ {t} = \mathbb {F} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} \kappa^ {j - 1} \left(s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}\right) \right] + \mathbb {F} _ {t} [ \kappa^ {T} v _ {t + T} ] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} \kappa^ {j - 1} \left(s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}\right) \right] + \left(\mathbb {F} _ {t} [ \kappa^ {T} v _ {t + T} ] + (\mathbb {F} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t}) \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} \kappa^ {j - 1} (s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}) \right]\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

Then, the transversality term  $\mathbb{E}_t[\kappa^T v_{t + T}]$  under the objective measure can be expressed as

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \kappa^ {T} v _ {t + T} ] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \kappa^ {T} v _ {t + T} ] + (\mathbb {F} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t}) \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} \kappa^ {j - 1} (s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}) \right],
$$

and the second term  $(\mathbb{F}_t - \mathbb{E}_t)\left[\sum_{j = 1}^T\kappa^{j - 1}(s_{t + j} - \widetilde{r}_{t + j})\right]$  on the right-hand side represents the investors' forecast error. In other words, what the econometrician perceives as transversality condition violation can be explained by the investors' subjective belief errors.

Specifically, if the investors systematically over-predict surpluses or under-predict returns when the debt/GDP ratio increases, this forecast error term can impute a unit root in the debt/GDP ratio under the econometrician's measure  $\mathbb{E}$ . At the same time, under the investors' subjective beliefs measure  $\mathbb{F}$ , the debt/GDP ratio may remain stationary. In this case, we obtain

$$
\lim _ {T \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \kappa^ {T} v _ {t + T} ] = \lim _ {T \to \infty} (\mathbb {F} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t}) \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} \kappa^ {j - 1} (s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}) \right].
$$

Let us consider a concrete example that gives a full specification of the debt dynamics under the two measures. For simplicity, we abstract away from variations in growth-adjusted returns by setting  $\widetilde{r}_{t+j} = 0$  under both measures and let  $\kappa = 1$  which is consistent with the primary surplus being zero on average.

We assume that, under the econometrician's objective measure  $\mathbb{E}$ , the surplus process is stationary and follows an i.i.d. process:

$$
s _ {t} = \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {\mathbb {E}},
$$

which implies that the debt/output ratio is a random walk:

$$
v _ {t} = v _ {t - 1} - \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {\mathbb {E}}.
$$

Therefore, under the econometrician's measure  $\mathbb{E}$ , the debt/output ratio satisfies

$$
v _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} \left(s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}\right) + \mathbb {E} _ {t} v _ {t + T} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} v _ {t + T},
$$

which is a unit root process. More precisely, if we repeat the regressions in our baseline result, we would find that the variation in the debt/output ratio is  $100\%$  attributable to the transversality term  $\mathbb{E}_t[v_{t + T}]$ , and  $0\%$  to the variations in the surplus and return processes due to the i.i.d. assumption.

Under the investors' subjective measure  $\mathbb{F}$ , the surplus responds to debt level:

$$
s _ {t} = b v _ {t - 1} + \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {\mathbb {F}},
$$

with a coefficient  $b > 0$ . Under this measure, the government debt/output ratio is priced according to

$$
v _ {t} = \mathbb {F} _ {t} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} \left(s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}\right) + \mathbb {F} _ {t} \left[ v _ {t + T} \right] = \mathbb {F} _ {t} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} b v _ {t + j - 1} + \mathbb {F} _ {t} \left[ v _ {t + T} \right] \tag {8.17}
$$

We conjecture and verify that the law of motion for the debt/output ratio under the subjective measure  $\mathbb{F}$  is

$$
v _ {t + 1} = \psi v _ {t} + \eta_ {t + 1} ^ {\mathbb {F}}.
$$

Plug the investors' subjective surplus response into the linearized government budget constraint, we obtain the following solution

$$
\psi = 1 - b
$$

$$
\eta_ {t + 1} ^ {\mathbb {F}} = - \varepsilon_ {t} ^ {\mathbb {F}}.
$$

In other words, due to their biased belief, the investors think that the debt/output process is stationary with a persistence that is consistent with their expected response of surplus to the debt/output ratio. Therefore, if we take Eq. (8.17) to the limit,

$$
v _ {t} = \lim  _ {T \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {F} _ {t} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} b v _ {t + j - 1} + \lim  _ {T \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {F} _ {t} [ v _ {t + T} ],
$$

we obtain that the variation in the debt/output ratio is  $100\%$  attributable to the expected future surplus  $\lim_{T\to \infty}\mathbb{F}_t\sum_{j = 1}^T bv_{t + j - 1}$ , and  $0\%$  to the transversality term.

These equations constitute a full specification of the debt dynamics under the two measures, which is mean-reverting according to the investors and has a unit root according to the econometrician. We can rearrange the equations and obtain

$$
v _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} v _ {t + T} = 0 + (\mathbb {F} _ {t} - \mathbb {E} _ {t}) \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {T} (s _ {t + j} - \widetilde {r} _ {t + j}),
$$

which implies that the valuation of government debt is fully driven by the investors' belief bias  $(\mathbb{F}_t - \mathbb{E}_t)$ , which provides an economic interpretation of the transversality term  $\mathbb{E}_t[v_{t + T}]$  under the econometrician's measure.

# 8.E.4 Dollar-Weighted Return and Government's Market Timing

Another way to gauge the fiscal capacity is to understand the timing of the fiscal cash flows. As we discussed in Section 2.B.3, the market timing of the government issuer, as well as that of the investors in the Treasury market can be measured by the internal rate of return (IRR). In the data, the foreign investors have been earning a low IRR, compared to the IRR that can be achieved from a simple buy-and-hold strategy [Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig, 2022a]. The flip side of this observation is that the U.S. government has been enjoying a low effective funding rate, thanks mainly to the foreign investors and the Federal Reserve. In other words, the government tends to time the market by issuing more debt in recessions when the interest rate is low and the debt is expensive, and issuing less debt in expansions when the interest rate is high and the debt is cheap.

# 8.E.5 International Perspectives

We also note that this public debt valuation puzzle is not necessarily a universal phenomenon. Chen, Jiang, Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Xiaolan [2022] study historical fiscal data in the U.S., the U.K., and the Netherlands. Prior to the U.S., the U.K. and the Dutch were the dominant reserve asset issuers. We learn some common lessons from their rises and falls: there is usually a unique hegemon who dominates the supply of reserve assets. The hegemon enjoys a convenience yield on its debt, and issues more debt than is warranted by its fiscal backing. However, these exorbitant privileges do not last forever: when the hegemon's fiscal fundamentals deteriorate, investors eventually withdraw the extra debt capacity, and debt market crash ensues.

This observation raises the bar for any explanation of the public debt valuation puzzle, because it needs to answer not only why this

extra fiscal capacity accrues to the U.S. or other global hegemons in the past, and not to other countries. In this sense, these results call for an international perspective on fiscal sustainability issues.

On the other hand, this observation connects the public debt valuation puzzle to the literature on the coordination on reserve assets [Farhi and Maggiori, 2018, He, Krishnamurthy, and Milbradt, 2019, Gopinath and Stein, 2021, Coppola, Krishnamurthy, and Xu, 2023]. This literature points out that there is strategic complementarity in different investors' investment decisions. The reserve asset that is commonly chosen by the investors, which usually coincides with the hegemon in the economic and political spheres, could enjoy not only a convenience yield in the price dimension, but also the ability to issue more debt beyond its fiscal backing in the quantity dimension. That said, the coordinated outcome could be broken when the investors become concerned about the hegemon's fiscal position, as we have seen in the case of the Dutch and the U.K. Moreover, this literature also explores the strategic decisions of one or more reserve asset issuers, who take their market power into consideration when deciding how much debt to issue [Choi, Kirpalani, and Perez, 2022, Jiang and Richmond, 2023a]. Their endogenous issuance decisions also affect the valuation of the reserve assets.

In conclusion, it is worth reflecting upon a quote from Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith:

A prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money.

Our discussion shows that the issue of government debt valuation and sustainability is more complicated. Investors are willing to offer extra fiscal capacity to the world's safe asset supplier beyond what is warranted by its fiscal fundamentals and seigniorage revenues. When the safe asset supplier's relative fundamentals deteriorate, this extra fiscal backing is withdrawn by bond investors who then focus only on the country's fundamentals.

3 More broadly, the strategic coordination issues between governments and policymakers enrich the possible outcomes in the international economy. Besides the classical tariff war studied by the international trade literature, recent papers study the strategic interaction along multiple fronts, including monetary policies [Egorov and Mukhin, 2019, Fontanier, 2023], trade and monetary policies [Auray, Devereux, and Eyquem, 2019], trade and containment policies [Acharya, Jiang, Richmond, and von Thadden, 2020], bank regulation [Clayton and Schaab, 2022], and geopolitics [Clayton, Maggiori, and Schreger, 2023]. A common theme is the emphasis on the exchange rate as both a policy instrument and a coordinated outcome.

# Portfolio Choice and Asset Demand

# Summary

- International portfolio choices underlie each country's external imbalance and capital flow dynamics. A country's net foreign assets are directly a consequence of portfolio choices:

$$
n f a _ {t} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} a _ {t} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t} (\iota) - a _ {t} ^ {*} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t} ^ {*} (\iota),
$$

the capital flows depend on how the portfolio choices evolve:

$$
c f _ {t} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \sum_ {\iota} \left(a _ {t} x _ {F, t} (\iota) - a _ {t - 1} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) \frac {p _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)}{p _ {t - 1} ^ {*} (\iota)}\right) - \sum_ {\iota} \left(a _ {t} ^ {*} x _ {H, t} ^ {*} (\iota) - a _ {t - 1} ^ {*} x _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} (\iota) \frac {p _ {t} (\iota)}{p _ {t - 1} (\iota)}\right),
$$

and the profits from the chosen portfolios determine how a country's external wealth evolves:

$$
n f a _ {t} - n f a _ {t - 1} = t b _ {t} + i b _ {t} + c g _ {t}.
$$

- The standard asset pricing literature models portfolio choices as the mean-variance trade-off plus additional dynamic hedging terms:

$$
x _ {t} = \gamma^ {- 1} \Sigma_ {t} ^ {- 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + 1} \right] + \text {d y n a m i c h e d g i n g t e r m s}.
$$

- Alternatively, the demand system approach models portfolio choices based on asset prices, characteristics, and latent demand terms:

$$
x _ {t} = \frac {\exp (\alpha \log p _ {t} + \beta \Xi_ {t} + \kappa_ {t})}{1 + \sum_ {k} \exp (\alpha \log p _ {t} + \beta \Xi_ {t} + \kappa_ {t})}.
$$

Central in any account of the international monetary system is how the investors in different countries choose their portfolios, how their portfolios differ in ex-ante characteristics and in ex-post returns, and how the capital flows due to investment rebalancing and pay-outs allocate resources across countries. Answers to these questions inform us about how the international monetary system is organized,

which countries play a central role, and the benefits and costs of being at the central location.

In this chapter, we relate the households' equilibrium portfolio choices on the finance side to important quantities on the macro side such as net foreign assets and balance of payments. Then, we discuss two complementary approaches to modeling portfolio choices. One is the traditional mean-variance approach, which is also central in the standard asset pricing literature. The other is the demand system approach, which results from more recent developments. We will also discuss specifications and applications of these approaches adapted for studying international portfolio dynamics.

# 9.A Net Foreign Assets Accounting

To begin with, we relate the portfolio allocation decisions to aggregate international macro variables such as net foreign assets (NFA) and balance of payments. Our setting again nests the benchmark model in Section 1.A with one extension: home and foreign households can trade more assets than just the risk-free bonds. Let  $\iota \in \{1,\dots,I\}$  index the different assets issued by either country, which we refer to asset classes. These asset classes include the risk-free bond, but they may also include typical asset classes such as equity and long-term debt. We work out the NFA accounting between two countries, and our approach follows Jiang, Richmond, and Zhang [2022c] which considers a more general multi-country setting. For discussions and decompositions of the external adjustments, also see Gourinchas and Rey [2007a], Ghironi, Lee, and Rebucci [2015].

# 9.A.1 Household Portfolio and Net Foreign Assets

Let us start with some definitions on the asset pricing side. We use  $x_{H,t}(\iota)$  and  $x_{F,t}(\iota)$  to denote the home households' portfolio shares allocated to home and foreign assets, which satisfy

$$
\sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t} (\iota) + \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t} (\iota) = 1.
$$

Similarly, foreign households' portfolio shares satisfy  $\sum_{\iota}x_{H,t}^{*}(\iota) + \sum_{\iota}x_{F,t}^{*}(\iota) = 1$ . For simplicity, we will omit the foreign households' expressions whenever they are symmetric.

We use  $a_{t}$  and  $a_{t}^{*}$  to denote the home and foreign households' wealth. In this case, it is simpler to denote both in home currency units. We define the home households' net foreign assets ( $nfa$ ) as the difference between their holdings of foreign assets (i.e., their external assets) minus the foreigners' holdings of their domestic assets (i.e.,

their external liabilities):

$$
n f a _ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} a _ {t} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t} (\iota) - a _ {t} ^ {*} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t} ^ {*} (\iota). \tag {9.1}
$$

Let  $p_t(\iota)$  and  $p_t^*(\iota)$  denote the asset prices, and let  $div_t(\iota)$  and  $div_t^*(\iota)$  denote the dividend or interest payouts, all in home currency terms. We use  $r_t(\iota)$  to denote the cum-dividend returns in log:

$$
\exp (r _ {t} (\iota)) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {p _ {t} (\iota) + d i v _ {t} (\iota)}{p _ {t - 1} (\iota)}.
$$

In this section, we further break down the cum-dividend returns into the ex-dividend component  $\rho_t(\iota)$  (i.e., capital gains) and the dividend yield component  $d_t(\iota)^1$ :

$$
\exp (r _ {t} (\iota)) = 1 + \rho_ {t} (\iota) + d _ {t} (\iota),
$$

$$
\rho_ {t} (\iota) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {p _ {t} (\iota) - p _ {t - 1} (\iota)}{p _ {t - 1} (\iota)},
$$

$$
d _ {t} (\iota) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {d i v _ {t} (\iota)}{p _ {t - 1} (\iota)}.
$$

Intuitively, household wealth accumulates as a result of realized financial returns from existing positions as well as additional financial savings deposited to their accounts. Let  $s_t$  denote the financial savings from period  $t - 1$  to  $t$  in home currency terms. Then, we obtain the standard law of motion for home household wealth:

$$
a _ {t} = a _ {t - 1} \left(\sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} (\iota) \exp \left(r _ {t} (\iota)\right) + \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)\right)\right) + s _ {t}. \tag {9.2}
$$

Finally, let  $q_{t}(\iota)$  denote the notional quantity of the asset, and let  $m_{t}(\iota)$  denote the total market value (i.e., market capitalization). The market clearing condition for each asset can be expressed as

$$
m _ {t} (\iota) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} p _ {t} (\iota) q _ {t} (\iota) = a _ {t} x _ {H, t} (\iota) + a _ {t} ^ {*} x _ {H, t} ^ {*} (\iota). \tag {9.3}
$$

We can relate the market value of all home assets to the home households' wealth by the NFA:

$$
a _ {t} = \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t} (\iota) + n f a _ {t},
$$

which generalizes Eq. (7.3) to the multi-asset case.

The NFA definition (9.1), wealth law of motion (9.2), and market clearing (9.3) constitute an equation system that describes the asset market. If we also take a stance on how the households decide their portfolio shares  $x_{H,t}$  and  $x_{F,t}$ , which is to be specified in subsequent sections, then, we can solve the equilibrium asset prices, household wealth dynamics, and international NFA dynamics and capital flows.

1 Throughout the note, we use  $r_t$  to denote returns in log. Here it is easier to deviate from this notational convention and instead use  $\rho_t$  and  $d_t$  to denote components of returns in level.

# 9.A.2 Balance of Payments

Having specified the asset market space, we next turn to its connection to the quantity side. In international macroeconomics, it is common to use the following balance of payments identity to organize the law of motion for the net foreign assets:

$$
n f a _ {t} - n f a _ {t - 1} = t b _ {t} + i b _ {t} + c g _ {t}, \tag {9.4}
$$

where  $tb$  denotes the trade balance,  $ib$  the income balance, and  $cg$  the capital gains.

The trade balance is defined in the standard way as the value of exports minus the value of imports, expressed in the home currency.

The income balance is defined as the earnings on foreign investments minus the payments made to foreign investors:

$$
i b _ {t} = a _ {t - 1} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) d _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota) - a _ {t - 1} ^ {*} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} (\iota) d _ {t} (\iota).
$$

The capital gains are defined as the changes in the value of assets that the home households hold abroad minus changes in the value of domestic assets held by foreign investors:

$$
c g _ {t} = a _ {t - 1} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) \rho_ {t} ^ {*} (\iota) - a _ {t - 1} ^ {*} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} (\iota) \rho_ {t} (\iota).
$$

The sum of income balance and capital gains (i.e.,  $ib_{t} + cg_{t}$ ) captures the overall wealth transfer between home and foreign households due to their holdings of each other's assets. The balance of payments identity (9.4) states that the home country accumulates a higher NFA position when (i) it runs a trade surplus, which results in claims that foreigners owe to the home country, and (ii) it earns a higher financial return than it pays to foreigners, which includes both capital gains and dividend payouts. Conversely, if the NFA remains constant, any trade deficit (i.e., negative  $tb$ ) has to be offset by a positive financial return (i.e., positive  $ib + cg$ ), as we have seen in the case of the U.S. in Chapter 7.

In international macroeconomics, it is also common to bundle together the trade balance and the income balance into the current account:  $ca_{t} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} tb_{t} + ib_{t}$ , which describes the net earnings of the home country from its international trade and investments. As capital gains  $cg_{t}$  capture important variations in cross-border wealth transfers from financial markets in the data, we find it more convenient to conceptually bundle the income balance and the capital gains as total financial transfers.

# 9.A.3 Capital Flows

Cross-border capital flows are also related to disaggregated bilateral portfolio choices. The market value of net position changes in the

foreign assets held by the home households is

$$
\sum_ {\iota} \left(a _ {t} x _ {F, t} (\iota) - a _ {t - 1} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) \frac {p _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)}{p _ {t - 1} ^ {*} (\iota)}\right).
$$

Similarly, the market value of net position changes in the home assets held by the foreign households is

$$
\sum_ {\iota} \left(a _ {t} ^ {*} x _ {H, t} ^ {*} (\iota) - a _ {t - 1} ^ {*} x _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} (\iota) \frac {p _ {t} (\iota)}{p _ {t - 1} (\iota)}\right).
$$

These quantities capture the position changes in cross-border portfolio holdings due to investors' active portfolio rebalancing and trading. Variations in asset prices and hence capital gains do not affect these quantities. The (portfolio-driven) net capital flows are defined as their difference:

$$
c f _ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \sum_ {\iota} \left(a _ {t} x _ {F, t} (\iota) - a _ {t - 1} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) \frac {p _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)}{p _ {t - 1} ^ {*} (\iota)}\right) - \sum_ {\iota} \left(a _ {t} ^ {*} x _ {H, t} ^ {*} (\iota) - a _ {t - 1} ^ {*} x _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} (\iota) \frac {p _ {t} (\iota)}{p _ {t - 1} (\iota)}\right),
$$

which is increasing in the home households' purchase of foreign assets and decreasing in the foreign households' purchase of home assets.

Using this definition, we can decompose the net foreign assets dynamics as

$$
n f a _ {t} - n f a _ {t - 1} = c g _ {t} + c f _ {t}, \tag {9.5}
$$

which clearly separates the valuation effects as captured by the capital gains  $c g_{t}$  from the quantity changes as captured by the net capital flows  $c f_{t}$ .

Moreover, the income balance constitutes another form of cross-border flows, which results from the dividend or coupon payouts to foreign investors. Since  $c f_{t}$  and  $i b_{t}$  denote flows in opposite directions under our notation, the aggregate financial flow is their difference:

$$
f f _ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} c f _ {t} - i b _ {t}. \tag {9.6}
$$

Combining Eq. (9.4), (9.5), and (9.6), we obtain an identity between the trade balance and the aggregate financial flow:

$$
t b _ {t} = f f _ {t} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} c f _ {t} - i b _ {t},
$$

which states another form of the balance of payments identity. This identity again shows that imbalances on the trade side need to be consistent with the adjustments on the financial side. Specifically, a trade surplus corresponds to a net purchase of foreign assets by home households, which results in a financial outflow.

# 9.A.4 Market Clearing and Financial Savings

We next consider market clearing, which connects the assets' market values to the households' financial wealth. In the financial autarky case,  $nfa = tb = ib = cg = 0$ , and we have the domestic market clearing conditions:

$$
a _ {t} x _ {H, t} (\iota) = m _ {t} (\iota),
$$

$$
a _ {t} = \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t} (\iota).
$$

Then, given the definition of financial savings under autarky, i.e.,

$$
a _ {t} = \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t - 1} (\iota) \left(1 + d _ {t} (\iota) + \rho_ {t} (\iota)\right) + s _ {t},
$$

we obtain the following relationship between financial savings and asset market values:

$$
s _ {t} = \left(\sum_ {\iota} m _ {t} (\iota) - \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t - 1} (\iota) \left(1 + \rho_ {t} (\iota)\right)\right) - \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t - 1} (\iota) d _ {t} (\iota). \tag {9.7}
$$

The first term on the right-hand side captures new asset issuances, which channel funds from the households to the corporate sector. The second term captures dividend payouts, which are transfers in the opposite direction from the corporate sector to the households. The households' financial savings are equal to the transfers from households to the corporate sector in the form of asset issuances minus the transfers from the corporate sector to the households in the form of dividend payouts.

Another way to understand this relationship is to realize that not everyone in this economy can reinvest their dividends and hold more shares at the same time. So, by market clearing, absent issuing new assets and financing new projects, dividend payouts have to be taken out of the financial market and consumed, which results in a decrease in the households' financial savings.

With these lessons learned from the autarky economy, we are now ready to consider the more general case with cross-border investments. We can extend Eq. (9.7) and obtain the following result in the open economy.

Proposition 9.1. The home households' financial savings  $s_t$  are equal to the trade balance  $tb_t$  plus the net transfers between investors and the home corporate sector:

$$
s _ {t} = t b _ {t} + \left(\sum_ {\iota} m _ {t} (\iota) - \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t - 1} (\iota) (1 + \rho_ {t} (\iota))\right) - \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t - 1} (\iota) d _ {t} (\iota).
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.39. This result connects the trade balance on the macro side to net financial savings and asset issuance on the asset market side.

First, consider the case in which asset issuances are exactly equal to the dividend payouts. Then, we obtain a special case:

$$
t b _ {t} = s _ {t},
$$

which states that the trade balance is equal to the home households' net financial savings. In this case, absent transfers to and from the financial markets, savings can only result from exporting more goods to foreigners and earning their IOUs.

Next, consider the case in which the trade balance is  $tb_{t} = 0$ , and the dividend payouts are  $d_{t}(\iota) = 0$ . Then, we obtain

$$
s _ {t} = \left(\sum_ {\iota} m _ {t} (\iota) - \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t - 1} (\iota) (1 + \rho_ {t} (\iota))\right),
$$

which implies that the asset issuances in the home country are entirely financed by the home households' financial savings. If the foreign households participate in the financing of the new issuances, we should expect to see capital flows which, by the previous section, should result in non-zero trade balance. Thus, the trade balance becomes the sufficient statistics for the foreign households' participation in the home asset issuances and financial savings process.

Finally, we can understand the general case by again understanding that  $(\sum_{t}m_{t}(\iota) - \sum_{t}m_{t - 1}(\iota)(1 + \rho_{t}(\iota))) - \sum_{t}m_{t - 1}(\iota)d_{t}(\iota)$  captures the net transfers between (home and foreign) investors and the home corporate sector. When the home investors contribute funds to the home corporate sector, we expect to see manifestations in the financial savings  $s_t$ . When the foreign investors contribute funds to the home corporate sector, we expect to see manifestations in the trade balance  $tb_t$ .

Conversely, once we understand how the asset market players in different countries make their saving and issuance decisions, we should also expect adjustments on the trade side. In particular, for the U.S. which runs persistent trade deficits, this approach offers an account of the financial drivers that fund the trade deficits.

# 9.A.5 Relation to National Consumption

Finally, we make a connection to consumption decisions in the national accounts. We assume that the aggregate output  $y_{t}$  is split into payoff to the financial assets and labor income  $w_{t}^{\ell}$ , i.e.,

$$
p _ {t} y _ {t} = \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t} (\iota) d _ {t} (\iota) + w _ {t} ^ {\ell}.
$$

Then, we can rewrite the standard household budget constraint Eq. (1.1) as

$$
a _ {t - 1} \left(\sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} (\iota) \exp (r _ {t} (\iota)) + \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) \exp (r _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota))\right) + w _ {t} ^ {\ell} = c _ {t} + a _ {t}.
$$

The left-hand side is the national income for the home households, which consists of financial asset payoff and labor income. The right-hand side contains two types of expenditure: consumption and financial investments.

Using Eq. (9.2), we obtain

$$
c _ {t} = w _ {t} ^ {\ell} - s _ {t},
$$

which states that consumption is equal to labor income minus financial savings. For example, if the investors experience a high return from the financial assets they hold, they can liquidate some of their financial assets and increase consumption.

In this context, it is more convenient to consider a notion of net financial savings, which includes the dividends households receive:

$$
f _ {t} \stackrel {{\text {d e f}}} {{=}} s _ {t} + a _ {t - 1} \left(\sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} (\iota) d _ {t} (\iota) + \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) d _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)\right).
$$

This notion allows us to express the household wealth as the sum of the previous period's wealth, the capital gains, and the net financial savings:

$$
a _ {t} = a _ {t - 1} \left(1 + \sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} (\iota) \rho_ {t} (\iota) + \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) \rho_ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)\right) + f _ {t}. \tag {9.8}
$$

For example, if the net financial savings  $f_{t} = 0$ , the households consume all dividend payouts instead of reinvesting them in the financial market. In this case, the households' financial wealth accumulates according to the capital gains from their existing positions.

This expression implies

$$
f _ {t} - a _ {t - 1} \left(\sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} (\iota) d _ {t} (\iota) + \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) d _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)\right) = s _ {t} = w _ {t} ^ {\ell} - c _ {t},
$$

or

$$
c _ {t} = w _ {t} ^ {\ell} + a _ {t - 1} \left(\sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} (\iota) d _ {t} (\iota) + \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) d _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)\right) - f _ {t}.
$$

So, the consumption is equal to labor income plus dividend payouts minus net financial savings  $f_{t}$ . Suppose the home households do not buy or sell any of their financial assets, i.e.,  $f_{t} = 0$ , then, the consumption is equal to labor income plus dividend payouts. In contrast, if the home households decide to save more by purchasing additional financial assets, they will have a lower consumption.

# 9.B The Mean-Variance Approach

This set-up follows the standard Merton [1969] portfolio problem with multiple assets. For tractability, we assume households have power utility and a finite horizon  $T$ . This set-up is otherwise similar to the domestic economy considered in Chapter 1, which is populated by a representative household. The household maximizes expected lifetime utility:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {T} \delta^ {t} \frac {c _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \right].
$$

The household can trade a set of financial assets. Let  $w_{t}$  denote the wealth before consumption, and let  $a_{t}$  denote its total asset under management after consumption. Risky assets are indexed by  $\iota \in \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ , and there is an asset that is risk-free in real terms. Let  $x_{t}(\iota)$  denote the households' portfolio share on the asset  $\iota$ , and let  $\exp (r_{t + 1}(\iota))$  denote the asset's real return. Let  $\exp (r_t^f)$  denote the risk-free asset's real return. Then, the portfolio-level return can be expressed as

$$
\exp \left(r _ {t + 1} ^ {p}\right) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \left(1 - \sum_ {\iota \geq 1} x _ {t - 1} (\iota)\right) \exp \left(r _ {t - 1} ^ {f}\right) + \sum_ {\iota \geq 1} x _ {t - 1} (\iota) \exp \left(r _ {t} (\iota)\right),
$$

which can be expressed more conveniently in vector form:

$$
\exp (r _ {t + 1} ^ {p}) = \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {f}) + x _ {t - 1} ^ {\prime} (\exp (r _ {t}) - \exp (r _ {t - 1} ^ {f})).
$$

The standard law of motion for home household wealth is

$$
w _ {t} = a _ {t} + c _ {t} = a _ {t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t + 1} ^ {p}\right).
$$

Let  $z_{t}$  denote the vector of state variables that determine the distribution of returns. We define the value function as

$$
\psi_ {t} \left(w _ {t}, z _ {t}\right) \stackrel {{\text {d e f}}} {{=}} \max  _ {\left\{c _ {s}, x _ {s} \right\} _ {s = t} ^ {T}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {T} \delta^ {s} \frac {c _ {s} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \right],
$$

which can be expressed in the following recursive form

$$
\psi_ {t} \left(w _ {t}, z _ {t}\right) = \max  _ {c _ {t}, x _ {t}} \delta^ {t} \frac {c _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \psi_ {t + 1} \left(w _ {t + 1}, z _ {t + 1}\right) \right].
$$

This is a generic set up of a portfolio choice model. See Back [2010] for more details, or Duffie [2010] for a continuous-time formulation. To fully solve this model, we need to rely on specific assumptions of investor preferences and asset return dynamics. When the investors have power utility, we obtain the following characterizations for portfolio demand.

Proposition 9.2. (a) The value function satisfies

$$
\psi_ {t} (w _ {t}, z _ {t}) = \delta^ {t} f _ {t} (z _ {t}) \frac {w _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma},
$$

where the function  $f_{t}(z_{t})$  depends on the state variable and satisfies  $f_{t}(z_{t}) = wc_{t}^{\gamma}$  where  $wc_{t} = w_{t} / c_{t}$  denotes the wealth-consumption ratio.

(b) The optimal portfolio allocation satisfies

$$
x _ {t} = \arg \max  _ {x _ {t}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ f _ {t + 1} \left(z _ {t + 1}\right) \frac {\exp \left(\left(1 - \gamma\right) r _ {t + 1} ^ {p}\right)}{1 - \gamma} \right], \tag {9.9}
$$

where the log portfolio return  $r_{t+1}^p$  depends on the portfolio choice  $x_t$ .

The proof is in Appendix A.40. Eq. (9.9) implies that, when the investors maximize their expected portfolio return  $r_{t+1}^p$ , they also pay attention to the expected evolution of the state variable  $z_{t+1}$ . Consequently, the optimal portfolio choice  $x_t$  depends on the expected future state.

# 9.B.1 The Case of Constant Investment Opportunity

To derive closed-form solutions, the literature uses either continuous-time math or linearization to further simplify the problem. A popular choice is to approximate the portfolio return via log-linearization as proposed by Campbell and Viceira [2002], which approximates the log portfolio return by

$$
r _ {t + 1} ^ {p} \approx r _ {t} ^ {f} + x _ {t} ^ {\prime} (r _ {t + 1} - r _ {t} ^ {f} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2}) - \frac {1}{2} x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \Sigma_ {t} x _ {t},
$$

where  $\Sigma_t$  denotes the conditional variance-covariance matrix of the log returns, and  $\sigma_t^2$  is the vector containing the diagonal elements of  $\Sigma_t$ .

With this approximation formula, we can now solve the portfolio choice problem when the state variable is a constant, i.e.,  $z_{t} = \bar{z}$ , which implies that the asset returns are i.i.d. and  $f_{t + 1}(z_{t + 1})$  is a constant.

Proposition 9.3. When the asset returns are i.i.d. and normally distributed, the optimal portfolio choice is

$$
x _ {t} = \gamma^ {- 1} \Sigma_ {t} ^ {- 1} \left(\mathbb {E} \left[ r _ {t + 1} \right] + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - r _ {t} ^ {f}\right). \tag {9.10}
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.41. This formula (9.10) recovers the classical mean-variance trade-off in portfolio choice theory. In the numerator,  $\mathbb{E}[r_{t + 1}] - r_t^f$  denotes the assets' expected excess returns in log, and  $\frac{1}{2}\sigma_t^2$  captures the Jensen's term adjustment, so that the

sum  $\mathbb{E}[r_{t + 1}] + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_t^2 - r_t^f$  captures the assets' expected excess returns in level, which is exact when returns are normally distributed or in continuous time. In the denominator,  $\Sigma_t$  is the covariance matrix of asset returns and  $\gamma$  is the risk aversion coefficient. Therefore, the optimal portfolio favors assets that have high expected excess returns and low variance and covariance with other assets.

# 9.B.2 Special Cases with Time-varying Investment Opportunity

When the state variable  $z_{t}$  is time-varying, the problem becomes more difficult in general. Here we discuss two special cases. First, Campbell and Viceira [2002] consider a case in which the risk-free rate is time-varying but the risky assets' variances and risk premia are constant. In this case, the optimal portfolio choice is

$$
x _ {t} = \frac {1}{\gamma} \Sigma_ {t} ^ {- 1} \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t} r _ {t + 1} - r _ {t} ^ {f} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2}\right) + \left(1 - \frac {1}{\gamma}\right) \Sigma_ {t} ^ {- 1} c o v _ {t} \left(r _ {t + 1}, - \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t}\right) \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {\infty} \rho^ {j} r _ {t + j} ^ {f}\right). \tag {9.11}
$$

This solution contains two terms. The first term is similar to the solution under i.i.d. returns derived above, which depends on the assets' excess returns and variance-covariance matrix. The second term is commonly known as the hedging term, as the investors buy certain assets to hedge shocks to future investment opportunities. In this case, since risk premia are constant, variations in future investment opportunities are only driven by variations in the risk-free rate. Specifically, a surprise reduction in expected future risk-free rates represents a negative shock to future investment opportunities. When the risk aversion coefficient  $\gamma > 1$ , investors would like to load up more on assets that offer higher returns when expected future risk-free rates go down.

Second, if the investors have log utility, then, Eq. (9.9) can be simplified to

$$
x _ {t} = \arg \max  _ {x _ {t}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + 1} ^ {p} \right] \approx \arg \max  _ {x _ {t}} x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + 1} \right] - r _ {t} ^ {f} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2}\right) - \frac {1}{2} x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \Sigma_ {t} x _ {t},
$$

which does not depend on the state variable. In this sense, investors with log utility are myopic, as they choose portfolios like one-period investors. They do not pay attention to how different assets' returns respond to shocks to future investment opportunities. These investors also have a predetermined wealth-consumption ratio, which is a constant when the horizon  $T$  is infinite.

Moreover, with log utility (i.e.,  $\gamma = 1$ ), Eq. (9.11) in the first special case becomes  $x_{t} = \Sigma_{t}^{-1}\left(\mathbb{E}_{t}[r_{t + 1}] - r_{t}^{f} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{t}^{2}\right)$ . The optimal portfolio allocation no longer loads on the term that hedges the variations

in future interest rates, and the myopic investors only focus on the mean-variance trade-off.

# 9.C Applications of the Mean-Variance Approach (TODO)

# 9.D The Demand System Approach

Eq. (9.10) offers an intuitive way to think about the portfolio allocation problem as a mean-variance trade-off. While this approach has been powerful and universal, several challenges stand out. First, estimating the expectation and the variance-covariance matrix of asset returns is empirically challenging. As the assets' risk characteristics and investors' risk appetite are time-varying, the moments estimated from the past return data do not necessarily represent the distribution of future returns.

Second, investor demand for different assets and asset classes appears to be less elastic than what standard models imply. For example, according to Koijen and Yogo [2021], "a calibration of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) implies a demand elasticity for individual stocks that exceeds 5,000," whereas empirical estimates of the demand elasticity are closer to 1 or lower [Gabaix and Koijen, 2021], which is three orders of magnitude smaller.

In response to these challenges, Koijen and Yogo [2019] turn to a complementary approach based on demand systems. Instead of deriving the optimal portfolio choice from the mean-variance trade-off, their starting point is that the households allocate their wealth based on the assets' characteristics. In this section, we study the most basic demand system model based on logit demand functions.

# 9.D.1 Logit Demand

Let  $\delta_t(i)$  denote the desirability of asset  $i$ :

$$
\delta_ {t} (\iota) = \alpha \log p _ {t} (\iota) + \beta \Xi_ {t} (\iota) + \kappa_ {t} (\iota),
$$

where  $\log p_t(\iota)$  denotes the log asset price,  $\Xi_t(\iota)$  denotes the vector of additional observable asset characteristics, and  $\kappa_t(\iota)$  denotes an unobservable latent demand term. We expect  $\alpha < 0$ , in which case the households find an asset more attractive when its price is lower. The asset also becomes more attractive when it has some desirable attributes captured by  $\Xi_t(\iota)$ , which for example could include a lower price volatility, a higher credit rating, or simply a larger asset supply. With heterogeneous investors indexed by  $n$ , the characteristics could also be bilateral, i.e.,  $\Xi_{n,t}(\iota)$ , which could for example capture the investors' home bias towards domestic assets, or their preferences for

foreign assets according to proximity in geographic distance or trade network as we saw in Section 3.C. Finally, the latent demand term allows us to capture the unobservable characteristics of the asset that simultaneously generate a higher market share and a higher asset price by making the asset more attractive [Berry, 1994].

We assume that the households' allocation on this asset follows

$$
x _ {t} (\iota) = \frac {\exp \left(\delta_ {t} (\iota)\right)}{1 + \sum_ {k} \exp \left(\delta_ {t} (k)\right)}. \tag {9.12}
$$

We make several observations. First, if  $\alpha < 0$ , the households have a downward-sloping demand curve for this asset. This can be thought of as a generalization of the downward-sloping demand curve for reserve assets that we considered in Section 4.A. In our current setting, all assets face downward-sloping demand curves.

Second, the 1 in the denominator models the existence of an outside asset, which is a benchmark asset whose desirability  $\delta_t(0)$  is normalized to be 0. The choice of this outside asset is usually model-specific. For example, it could be bank deposits when studying the demand system of money market funds, or it could be the assets issued by small countries with missing characteristics when studying the demand system of international portfolio allocation.

Third, the households' allocation to asset  $\iota$  also depends on the desirability of other assets. When some other assets become relatively more desirable, then, the allocation to asset  $\iota$  goes down. Moreover, when all inside assets experience a uniform increase in their desirabilities, the allocations to all inside assets go up relative to the allocation to the outside asset.

Fourth, this set-up could be micro-founded in several ways. The most classical micro-foundation is borrowed from the field of industrial organization [Berry, 1994, Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes, 1995, Nevo, 2001]. Specifically, the problem of investors choosing which asset to hold is translated to the problem of consumers choosing which product to purchase. Suppose there is a continuum of investors indexed by  $n$ , and each investor has one dollar to invest. If investor  $n$  picks asset  $i$ , he or she has the following utility

$$
u _ {n, t} (\iota) = \delta_ {t} (\iota) + \varepsilon_ {n, t} (\iota).
$$

The outside asset 0 has utility  $u_{n,t}(0) = 0$ .

Investor  $n$  chooses to invest in asset  $\iota$  if  $u_{n,t}(\iota) \geq u_{n,t}(j)$  for all  $j$ . The term  $\varepsilon_{n,t}(\iota)$  captures the investor's personal preference. If this term is i.i.d. and follows the standard logit distribution with a cumulative distribution function  $\Phi(\varepsilon) = \exp(-\exp(-\varepsilon))$ , then, we can aggregate across all investors and derive the amount of funds

invested in asset  $\iota$  to be

$$
a _ {t} \frac {\exp (\delta_ {t} (t))}{1 + \sum_ {k} \exp (\delta_ {t} (k))},
$$

where  $a_{t}$  is the aggregate funds of the investors. In this way, we obtain the representative investor's demand function given by Eq. (9.12).

Alternatively, Koijen and Yogo [2019] propose a mapping from the standard mean-variance portfolio allocation problem in Section 9.B to the demand system. They do so by imposing a factor structure to the variance-covariance matrix of asset returns, allowing the factor loadings to depend on the asset characteristics, and adopting a particular form of approximation.

The characteristics-based demand could have other micro-foundations as well, such as private information, heterogeneous beliefs [Pellegrino, Spolaore, and Wacziarg, 2021], institutional constraints, and non-pecuniary preferences for certain traits such as ESG, the demand for reserve assets as we studied in Section 7, and behavioral factors.2

# 9.D.2 Closing the Model with the Supply Side

To close the model, we need to take a stance on the total amount of funds the households have for investments. Let us denote this total asset under management by  $a_{t}$ . In some models,  $a_{t}$  is exogenously determined; in other models,  $a_{t}$  depends on previous investment outcomes. For example, it makes sense to use the same law of motion for the asset under management as in the traditional portfolio model in Section 9.B:

$$
a _ {t} = a _ {t - 1} \left(\sum_ {\iota} x _ {t - 1} (\iota) \exp (r _ {t} (\iota))\right) + s _ {t},
$$

which requires us to model  $s_t$  representing how much the households save into their investment account after consumption. In the case that the households consume more than their income, the flow term  $s_t$  could be negative. Section 9.A discusses these flows in more details.

We also need to specify asset supply and market clearing. Let  $q_{t}(\iota)$  denote asset  $\iota$ 's quantity of shares. The market clearing condition is

$$
p _ {t} (\iota) q _ {t} (\iota) = a _ {t} x _ {t} (\iota). \tag {9.13}
$$

In some models, the asset supply  $q_{t}(\iota)$  is assumed to be a constant or exogenously specified. In other models, the asset supply is endogenous, as the issuers maximize their profits while being aware of the

2 For asset-level characteristics, see Daniel and Titman [1997] and the subsequent covariance vs. characteristics debate. Investor-level characteristics such as personalities [Jiang, Peng, and Yan, 2023c] and recall bias [Jiang, Liu, Peng, and Yan, 2022b] could affect portfolio allocations.

downward-sloping demand curve. Specifically, suppose the issuer of asset  $\iota$  maximizes the profit by setting the price:

$$
\max  _ {p} p q (p) - c (q (p)),
$$

where the issuance cost  $c(q)$  is a function of the quantity  $q$ , and the quantity  $q$  is determined by the demand curve at a given price  $p$ . We drop the period- $t$  subscripts for simplicity. Then, the first-order condition implies that the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost, which implies

$$
p - c ^ {\prime} (q (p)) = q (p) / q ^ {\prime} (p).
$$

On the left-hand side,  $p - c'(q(p))$  is the issuer's mark-up defined as the asset price minus the marginal cost. This result implies that the issuer sets the mark-up according to the demand elasticity.

Yet in other cases, the asset supply can be fully elastic, which means that the issuer can supply an arbitrary quantity of the asset at a given price. For example, this could apply to open-end money market funds whose underlying holdings are liquid and safe assets with a deep market. In this case, when there is a shock to investor demand, the market clears by quantity adjustment instead of by price adjustment.

# 9.D.3 Demand Elasticity

This demand system model also has a simple expression for demand elasticity. The log demand by issuer  $\iota$  is given by

$$
\log q _ {t} ^ {\text {d e m a n d}} (\iota) = \log \left(a _ {t} x _ {t} (\iota) / p _ {t} (\iota)\right),
$$

which implies that the demand elasticity is<sup>3</sup>

$$
- \frac {\partial \log q _ {t} ^ {\text {d e m a n d}} (\iota)}{\partial \log p _ {t} (\iota)} = 1 - \frac {\partial \log x _ {t} (\iota)}{\partial \log p _ {t} (\iota)} = 1 - (1 - x _ {t} (\iota)) \alpha .
$$

To interpret this result, note that we expect  $\alpha < 0$  as demand is decreasing in price. Then, the demand elasticity is increasing in the magnitude  $|\alpha|$ , a higher value of which means that the households' demand is more sensitive to the price. Magnitude-wise, suppose this asset is only  $1\%$  of the total market cap, and  $\alpha = -1$ , so that a  $1\%$  increase in asset price roughly leads to a  $1\%$  reduction in investor demand. Then, the demand elasticity is 1.99, which is already at the higher end of the distribution of empirical estimates.

The demand elasticity is also decreasing in the portfolio share  $x_{t}(\iota)$ , which means an asset with a larger size has fewer alternatives to substitute with. This is a desirable feature of the asset demand system, because reserve assets in high demand such as the U.S. Treasury

$$
{ } ^ { 3 } \text { ~ T h e ~ d e r i v a t i o n ~ i s s i m p l e : ~ } \frac { \partial \log x _ { t } ( i ) } { \partial \log p _ { t } ( i ) } =
$$

$$
\frac {\partial \delta_ {t} (i)}{\partial \log p _ {t} (i)} - \frac {\partial \log \left(1 + \sum_ {k} \exp (\delta_ {t} (k))\right)}{\partial \log p _ {t} (i)} = \alpha -
$$

$$
\alpha \frac {\exp (\delta_ {t} (i))}{1 + \sum_ {k} \exp (\delta_ {t} (k))}.
$$

tend to face a more inelastic demand curve [Choi, Dang, Kirpalani, and Perez, 2023]. If our asset demand system correctly captures the high market share in either the asset characteristics  $\Xi_t(\iota)$  or the latent demand  $\kappa_t(\iota)$ , then, we also make its demand curve more inelastic than other assets.

So far, we have only considered one representative household. It is straightforward to extend the model and allow for multiple investors, which, for example, is a natural case when we consider investments between different countries. Let  $n$  index the investors. Then, the market clearing condition becomes

$$
p _ {t} (\iota) q _ {t} (\iota) = \sum_ {n} a _ {n, t} x _ {n, t} (\iota),
$$

and the aggregate demand elasticity is simply a weighted average of individual investors' demand elasticities:

$$
- \frac {\partial \log q _ {t} ^ {\text {d e m a n d}} (\iota)}{\partial \log p _ {t} (\iota)} = \sum_ {n} \frac {a _ {n , t} x _ {n , t} (\iota)}{\sum_ {m} a _ {m , t} x _ {m , t} (\iota)} \left(- \frac {\partial \log q _ {n , t} ^ {\text {d e m a n d}} (\iota)}{\partial \log p _ {t} (\iota)}\right).
$$

# 9.D.4 What If There Is No Outside Asset?

The outside asset plays an important role in pinning down the equilibrium solution in this asset demand system. While this point is more general, let us consider a simple case in which there is one investor, one inside asset, and no outside asset. Then, regardless of the desirability of the asset, the portfolio share allocated towards this asset is always  $x_{t} = 1$ . We also assume that the asset quantity is  $q_{t} = 1$  and the asset pays no dividend. Then, the market clearing condition implies:

$$
p _ {t} = p _ {t} q _ {t} = a _ {t} x _ {t} = a _ {t},
$$

and the investor's wealth dynamics follows

$$
a _ {t} = a _ {t - 1} \frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t - 1}} + s _ {t}.
$$

We assume the wealth  $a_{t-1}$  and the asset price  $p_{t-1}$  in the last period are both 1. In this case, if the saving  $s_t = 0$ , the market clearing condition and the investor's wealth dynamics are consistent with any asset price  $p_t$ . If the saving  $s_t \neq 0$ , then, there will be no asset price that is consistent with the market clearing condition and the investor's wealth dynamics. Both cases are pathological.

In comparison, if we add the outside option, the portfolio choice becomes

$$
x _ {t} = \frac {\exp (\alpha \log p _ {t})}{1 + \exp (\alpha \log p _ {t})},
$$

the market clearing condition for the inside asset is:

$$
p _ {t} = p _ {t} q _ {t} = a _ {t} x _ {t},
$$

and, assuming that the outside option pays no return, the investor's wealth dynamics follows

$$
a _ {t} = a _ {t - 1} \left(\left(1 - x _ {t - 1}\right) + x _ {t - 1} \frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t - 1}}\right) + s _ {t} = \left(\left(1 - x _ {t - 1}\right) + x _ {t - 1} p _ {t}\right) + s _ {t}.
$$

We assume  $\alpha = -1$  and  $x_{t-1} = 1 / \sqrt{2}$ . Then, this system of equations has only one root with a positive asset price, with,

$$
p _ {t} = \sqrt {2} - 1, \qquad a _ {t} = 2 - \sqrt {2}, \qquad x _ {t} = 1 / \sqrt {2},
$$

when  $s_t = 0$ , and, consistent with our intuition, the asset price  $p_t$  is increasing in the saving  $s_t$ . The introduction of the outside asset makes the demand function for the book value of the inside asset downward-sloping in the asset price, i.e.,

$$
q _ {t} ^ {\text {d e m a n d}} = a _ {t} x _ {t} / p _ {t} = \frac {1 - x _ {t - 1} + x _ {t - 1} p _ {t} + s _ {t}}{p _ {t}} \frac {\exp (\alpha \log p _ {t})}{1 + \exp (\alpha \log p _ {t})},
$$

because the investor can substitute towards the outside asset if the inside asset is too expensive. As we plot in Figure 9.1, this demand function crosses a flat supply curve  $q_{t}^{supply} = 1\$  and determines the unique equilibrium price. In comparison, without the outside asset, the demand function for the book value of the inside asset is flat, and the equilibrium price is not determined.

# 9.D.5 Identifying the Elasticity

Finally, while this note deals with the theoretical issues of the asset demand system, it is worth noting that its empirical estimation and identification are also at the forefront of this literature. Here, we provide a brief discussion of the identification strategies used in the literature.

Generally speaking, to identify the shape of the demand curve, which is parameterized using the logit functional form in this section, we need variations in the supply curve. Therefore, the most straightforward instruments are the exogenous shifters of the supply curve. For example, Xiao [2020], Chen and Jiang [2022] use non-interest expenses of banks and funds as exogenous cost shifters to identify the demand for their assets. Diamond, Jiang, and Ma [2020] derive changes in the bank branches' marginal costs due to the shocks originating from other locations transmitted via the banks' internal capital market. In the context of government debt, Choi, Kirpalani, and Perez [2022] directly use plausibly exogenous changes in the debt supply.

Second, the literature has used the non-price characteristics of competing assets, commonly referred to as the BLP instruments [Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes, 1995]. The identification assumption is that the changes in these exogenous characteristics of other assets affect the residual demand curve for the asset in question. In the same spirit, Koijen and Yogo [2020] propose a model-based procedure to calculate counterfactual asset prices based on exogenous characteristics and use them as instruments. For example, suppose the asset demand is stronger for country pairs which trade a lot with each other. Then, solving the demand system model with the asset demand  $\delta_t(\iota)$  in Eq. (9.12) being a function of the trade relationship alone leads to exogenous variations in asset prices. Implicitly, this procedure uses a non-linear aggregation of all assets' characteristics as the instrument.

Third, Gabaix and Koijen [2020] propose a granular instrumental variable approach that exploits the idiosyncratic shocks from large players, which presents a new strategy for demand system settings.

# 9.E Application to International Portfolio Allocation

In this section, we consider a two-tier demand system that Koijen and Yogo [2020], Jiang, Richmond, and Zhang [2022c,d] use to study the international financial market. We consider a simplified case in which there are only two countries and two asset classes.

In this model, we assume that the investors make two sequen-

tial decisions. First, they allocate their wealth across different asset classes indexed by  $\ell$ , which we refer to as short-term bonds ( $\ell = 1$ ) and equities ( $\ell = 2$ ) in this note. Second, within each asset class, they allocate their wealth across different issuer countries indexed by  $\iota$ . As such, investor country  $n$ 's demand for the asset in class  $\ell$ , issuer country  $\iota$  has a nested-logit structure:

$$
x _ {n, t} (\iota , \ell) = x _ {n, t} (\ell) \cdot x _ {n, t} (\iota | \ell),
$$

where  $x_{n,t}(\ell)$  denotes the portfolio share of the entire asset class  $\ell$ , and  $x_{n,t}(\iota|\ell)$  denotes the portfolio share of the issuer country  $\iota$  within asset class  $\ell$ . This two-tier structure offers a richer structure to model the cross-sectional heterogeneity in the demand for different asset classes and countries separately.

The allocation within the asset class is similar to the one we considered in the baseline case:

$$
x _ {n, t} (\iota | \ell) = \frac {\exp \left(\delta_ {n , t} (\iota , \ell)\right)}{1 + \sum_ {k} \exp \left(\delta_ {n , t} (k , \ell)\right)},
$$

where

$$
\delta_ {n, t} (\iota , \ell) = \alpha \log \left(p _ {t} (\iota , \ell) \exp \left(e _ {t} (n) - e _ {t} (\iota)\right)\right) + \kappa_ {n, t} (\iota , \ell)
$$

captures the desirability of this asset  $(\iota, \ell)$ . We refer to the currency of the home country as the dollar. We use  $p_t(\iota, \ell)$  to denote the asset price in the local currency units, and  $e_t(\iota)$  to denote the log exchange rate of the local currency per dollar. Then,  $p_t(\iota, \ell) \exp(e_t(n) - e_t(\iota))$  captures the price of the asset from the issuer country  $\iota$  in the units of the local currency in the investor country  $n$ . For simplicity, we ignore the asset-specific characteristics  $\Xi_t(\iota)$ . We allow the latent demand  $\kappa_{n,t}(\iota, \ell)$  to be specific to the investor  $n$ .

The allocation across asset classes is modeled as

$$
x _ {n, t} (\ell) = \frac {\left(1 + \sum_ {k} \exp \left(\delta_ {n , t} (k , \ell)\right)\right) ^ {\lambda} \exp \left(\psi_ {\ell} + \xi_ {n , t} (\ell)\right)}{\sum_ {m} \left(1 + \sum_ {k} \exp \left(\delta_ {n , t} (k , m)\right)\right) ^ {\lambda} \exp \left(\psi_ {m} + \xi_ {n , t} (m)\right)},
$$

where  $\psi_{\ell} + \xi_{n,t}(\ell)$  captures the investor's preference for asset class  $\ell$ , which is similar to the latent demand term  $\kappa_{n,t}(\iota, \ell)$  for a specific issuer country  $\iota$ . In empirical specifications, the  $\kappa_{n,t}(\iota, \ell)$  across the asset classes are identified only up to a constant, which requires us to normalize this term to be zero for one asset class. The other term  $(\sum_{k} \exp(\delta_{n,t}(k, \ell)))^{\lambda}$  is known as the inclusive value, which captures the desirability of the assets within this asset class including their prices and latent demand terms. For microfoundation and more discussions of this inclusive value term, please refer to industrial organization textbooks such as Train [2009].

Let  $a_{n,t}$  denote the wealth of investor country  $n$  in the dollar units. Then, this investor country holds  $a_{n,t}x_{n,t}(\iota ,\ell)$  dollars' worth of the

asset  $(\iota, \ell)$ . Let  $q_{t}(\iota, \ell)$  denote asset  $\iota$ 's quantity of shares. Then, in the presence of multiple investor countries, the market clearing condition (9.13) is generalized to

$$
p _ {t} (\iota , \ell) \exp (- e _ {t} (\iota)) q _ {t} (\iota , \ell) = \sum_ {n} a _ {n, t} x _ {n, t} (\iota , \ell),
$$

for all issuer country  $\iota$  representing the set of insider assets and asset class  $\ell$ . We do not impose a market clearing condition on the outside asset, which is assumed to have an infinitely elastic supply at a fixed local-currency price and desirability.

Finally, as emphasized by Jiang, Richmond, and Zhang [2022c,d], the investor country  $n$ 's wealth responds endogenously to the asset returns. Let  $a_{t}$  denote the dollar value of its wealth, which follows the following law of motion:

$$
a _ {n, t} = a _ {n, t - 1} \left(\sum_ {\ell} \sum_ {\iota \geq 0} x _ {n, t - 1} (\iota , \ell) \exp (r _ {t} (\iota , \ell))\right) + s _ {n, t},
$$

where, for simplicity, we assume that the assets pay no dividends, and their dollar-denominated returns are given by their capital gains:

$$
\exp (r _ {t} (\iota , \ell)) = \frac {p _ {t} (\iota , \ell)}{p _ {t - 1} (\iota , \ell)} \exp (- \Delta e _ {t} (\iota)).
$$

We take the saving  $s_{n,t}$ , the asset quantity  $q_{t}(\iota, \ell)$ , and the latent demand  $\kappa_{n,t}(\iota, \ell)$  as exogenously given. The portfolio choices  $x_{n,t}(\iota, \ell)$ , the market clearing conditions, and the wealth law of motion jointly determine the equilibrium asset prices, exchange rates, and capital flows.

# 9.E.1 Macro Synthesis

We study the competitive equilibrium in which the portfolio choices follow the logit demand, the wealth follows the given law of motion, and the markets for all inside assets clear.

The exogenous variables are the savings, the latent demand terms, and the asset quantities:

$$
(s _ {n, t}, q _ {t} (\iota , \ell), \kappa_ {n, t} (\iota , \ell), \xi_ {n, t} (\ell)) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}, \quad \mathrm {f o r} \quad n, \iota , \ell = 1, 2.
$$

There are 23 endogenous variables in each period  $t$ :

$$
\left(a _ {n, t}, \delta_ {n, t} (\iota , \ell), x _ {n, t} (\iota , \ell), p _ {t} (\iota , \ell), e _ {t}\right) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}, \quad \text {f o r} \quad n, \iota , \ell = 1, 2.
$$

The model implies the following 22 equations, including 8 for portfolio choices:

$$
x _ {n, t} (\iota , \ell) = \frac {\exp \left(\delta_ {n , t} (\iota , \ell)\right) \left(1 + \sum_ {k} \exp \left(\delta_ {n , t} (k , \ell)\right)\right) ^ {\lambda - 1} \exp \left(\psi_ {\ell} + \xi_ {n , t} (\ell)\right)}{\sum_ {m} \left(1 + \sum_ {k} \exp \left(\delta_ {n , t} (k , m)\right)\right) ^ {\lambda} \exp \left(\psi_ {m} + \xi_ {n , t} (m)\right)}, \quad \text {f o r} \quad n, \iota , \ell = 1, 2,
$$

8 for asset-level desirabilities:

$$
\delta_ {n, t} (\iota , \ell) = \alpha \log \left(p _ {t} (\iota , \ell) \exp \left(e _ {t} (n) - e _ {t} (\iota)\right)\right) + \kappa_ {n, t} (\iota , \ell), \quad \text {f o r} \quad n, \iota , \ell = 1, 2,
$$

2 for the law of motion of wealth:

$$
a _ {n, t} = a _ {n, t - 1} \left(\sum_ {\ell} \sum_ {\iota \geq 0} x _ {n, t - 1} (\iota , \ell) \frac {p _ {t} (\iota , \ell)}{p _ {t - 1} (\iota , \ell)} \exp (- \Delta e _ {t} (\iota))\right) + s _ {n, t}, \quad \text {f o r} \quad n = 1, 2,
$$

and 4 for market clearing:

$$
p _ {t} (\iota , \ell) \exp (- e _ {t} (\iota)) q _ {t} (\iota , \ell) = \sum_ {n} a _ {n, t} x _ {n, t} (\iota , \ell), \quad \text {f o r} \quad \iota , \ell = 1, 2.
$$

Finally, we define an auxiliary variable representing the U.S. net foreign assets (NFA):

$$
n f a _ {t} = \sum_ {\ell} a _ {1, t} x _ {1, t} (2, \ell) - \sum_ {\ell} a _ {2, t} x _ {2, t} (1, \ell).
$$

We can use the portfolio choices, asset-level desirabilities, and the law of motion of wealth to solve for the endogenous variables  $x_{n,t}(\iota ,\ell), \delta_{n,t}(\iota ,\ell)$ , and  $a_{n,t}$ . With  $N = 2$  countries and  $L = 2$  asset classes,  $NL + (N - 1) = 5$  endogenous asset prices and exchange rates remain to be solved, but only  $NL = 4$  market clearing conditions are available. Therefore, our system is underdetermined. In a traditional macro model, we have additional restrictions on the exchange rate from the goods market clearing. While this is an interesting component to incorporate into the asset demand system, here we use different assumptions to close the model. We will consider three different settings in our numeric exercise, highlighting the difference between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes as well as the difference between symmetric and asymmetric settings between the U.S. and the foreign country. In each of these settings, we have exactly the same number of restrictions as the number of endogenous asset prices and exchange rates.

# 9.E.2 Calibration and Results (TODO)

# 9.E.3 Other Works

In this section, we considered a simple two-country, two-asset class demand system model to study the effects of the demand shocks on the exchange rate and the asset prices. The reality is much richer. For example, one feature we omit in our model is the currency denomination of the assets, which exhibits important heterogeneity across issuers and across investors [Maggiori, Neiman, and Schreger, 2020]. Moreover, the investor base could be further decomposed by different

sectors, such as banks, mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds, and so on [Fang, Hardy, and Lewis, 2022, Faia, Salomao, and Veghazy, 2022, Bergant, Milesi-Ferretti, and Schmitz, 2023, Zhou, 2023]. For example, our modeling of the bilateral holdings abstracts away from the roles of financial intermediaries, which may act more than just a pass-through.

# Market Segmentation and Financial Intermediation

# Summary

- We consider two forms of asset market segmentation and financial intermediation.  
- First, asset markets can be segmented between countries. Local households may not be able to directly hold foreign assets, and they rely on financiers to intermediate the cross-border capital flows. The financiers face financial constraints, which connect the portfolio imbalances they have to absorb to the risk premium they charge on foreign assets and currencies for providing this intermediation service.  
- Second, asset markets can be segmented within a country. Some households may not have access to the financial markets, which disconnects the aggregate consumption from the pricing of financial assets and exchange rates.

# 10.A A Model of International Financial Intermediation

In this section, we consider an international real business cycle (IRBC) model in which home and foreign households cannot trade any assets directly with each other, and specialized financiers are required to intermediate the cross-border capital flows. This model is adapted from Itskhoki and Mukhin [2021], whose key mechanism builds on Jeanne and Rose [2002], Gabaix and Maggiori [2015]. This model extends our baseline model in Chapter 1 in two ways. First, it replaces the endowment economy with a production economy, with standard features such as capital accumulation. Second, and more importantly, it models segmented markets and financial intermediation.

# 10.A.1 Households

The households' preferences are similar to those we considered in Section 6.B. Home and foreign households have preferences over

consumption and work. The home households' expected lifetime utility is

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \frac {1}{1 - \gamma} c _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma} - \frac {1}{1 + 1 / \nu} \ell_ {t} ^ {1 + 1 / \nu} \right].
$$

Here we consider a more general aggregation function for consumption goods. The home households' consumption bundle is composed of home and foreign goods:

$$
c _ {t} = \left[ \alpha^ {1 - \eta} c _ {H, t} ^ {\eta} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \eta} c _ {F, t} ^ {\eta} \right] ^ {1 / \eta}.
$$

The Cobb-Douglas aggregation function we considered in the baseline model is a special case obtained when  $\eta = 0$ . Here we consider a positive  $\eta$  to a more realistic degree of substitutability between home and foreign goods.

We use the home households' consumption bundle as the numétaire. Recall that  $p_t$  is the price of the home good in this numétaire. We use  $k_t$  to denote the capital stock,  $z_t$  to denote the households' gross investment,  $q_t$  to denote the rental rate of capital. The home households' budget constraint is

$$
\left(w _ {t} \ell_ {t} + q _ {t} k _ {t}\right) + \exp \left(r _ {t - 1}\right) b _ {H, t - 1} = c _ {t} + z _ {t} + b _ {H, t},
$$

where the households' labor income  $w_{t}\ell_{t}$  and capital income  $q_{t}k_{t}$  replace their endowment in the baseline model. Moreover, we depart from the baseline model by assuming (1) that the markets are segmented, and the households can only hold their domestic risk-free bond, and (2) that the households can invest in their capital stock.

Capital accumulates according to the standard rule:

$$
k _ {t + 1} = (1 - d) k _ {t} + z _ {t} - \frac {\kappa}{2} \frac {\left(\Delta k _ {t + 1}\right) ^ {2}}{k _ {t}},
$$

where  $d$  denotes the depreciation rate and  $\frac{\kappa}{2}\frac{(\Delta k_{t+1})^2}{k_t}$  denotes the quadratic adjustment cost.

Similarly, the foreign households maximize their expected lifetime utility:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \frac {1}{1 - \gamma} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {1 - \gamma} - \frac {1}{1 + 1 / \nu} \left(\ell_ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {1 + 1 / \nu} \right],
$$

where their consumption bundle is defined as

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} = \left[ \alpha^ {1 - \eta} (c _ {F, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\eta} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \eta} (c _ {H, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\eta} \right] ^ {1 / \eta}.
$$

Likewise, the foreign households can only hold their domestic risk-free bond. Their budget constraint is

$$
\left(w _ {t} ^ {*} \ell_ {t} ^ {*} + q _ {t} ^ {*} k _ {t} ^ {*}\right) + \exp \left(r _ {t - 1} ^ {*}\right) b _ {F, t - 1} ^ {*} = c _ {t} ^ {*} + z _ {t} ^ {*} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*}.
$$

# 10.A.2 Firms

We consider very simple firms in this model. In the home country, the firms use capital  $k_{t}$ , labor  $\ell_{t}$ , and intermediate input which is  $x_{t}$  units of the home consumption bundle to produce  $y_{t}$  units of the home goods:

$$
y _ {t} = \left(\exp (a _ {t}) k _ {t} ^ {\vartheta} \ell_ {t} ^ {(1 - \vartheta)}\right) ^ {1 - \phi} x _ {t} ^ {\phi}.
$$

The firms are competitive, unlike the firms with market power that we considered in Section 6. Their revenue  $p_t y_t$  is split among the three factors of production according to their marginal products:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \ell_ {t} w _ {t} = (1 - \vartheta) (1 - \phi) p _ {t} y _ {t}, \\ k _ {t} q _ {t} = \vartheta (1 - \phi) p _ {t} y _ {t}, \\ x _ {t} = \phi p _ {t} y _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

# 10.A.3 Segmented Markets and Financial Intermediation

As noted in the beginning of this section, market segmentation and the financial intermediary are the key departure from the standard IRBC models. Itskhoki and Mukhin [2021] consider two additional classes of agents: the financiers and the noise traders.

The noise traders buy and sell currencies to satisfy their liquidity demand. We assume that there is a measure  $n$  of identical noise traders. In period  $t$ , they hold  $n_t$  units of the home risk-free bond and  $n_t^*$  units of the foreign risk-free bond. They have a zero-cost portfolio, which means their positions in the home and foreign bonds have the same market value with opposite signs:

$$
\exp (- r _ {t}) n _ {t} = - \exp (- e _ {t}) \exp (- r _ {t} ^ {*}) n _ {t} ^ {*}. \tag {10.1}
$$

The size of their position is determined by an exogenous process:

$$
\exp (- r _ {t}) n _ {t} = n \left(\exp \left(\psi_ {t}\right) - 1\right),
$$

where

$$
\psi_ {t + 1} = (1 - \rho_ {\psi}) \bar {\psi} + \rho_ {\psi} \psi_ {t} + \varepsilon_ {\psi , t + 1}.
$$

There is also a measure  $m$  of identical financiers, who absorb the excess demand or supply of bonds from the noise traders and the households and earn a risk premium. They also hold a zero-cost portfolio. In period  $t$ , they hold  $d_t$  units of the home risk-free bond and  $d_t^*$  units of the foreign risk-free bond, which also satisfies the zero-cost constraint:

$$
\exp (- r _ {t}) d _ {t} = - \exp (- e _ {t}) \exp \left(- r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) d _ {t} ^ {*}. \tag {10.2}
$$

The financiers are myopic and maximize the CARA utility of their return:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ - \frac {1}{\omega} \exp (- \omega (1 - \exp (r x _ {t + 1})) d _ {t} ^ {*}) \right],
$$

where  $rx_{t + 1} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \Delta e_{t + 1} + r_t - r_t^*$  is the home currency's expected excess return in log. Itskhoki and Mukhin [2021] consider the continuous-time limit of this problem, in which the optimal solution is given by

$$
d _ {t} ^ {*} = - \frac {\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1})}{\omega v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1})}, \tag {10.3}
$$

This solution is identical to the myopic investors' optimal portfolio choice we derived in Section 9.3. Eq. (10.3) connects the currency's expected excess return to the financiers' portfolio position. These financiers absorb excess positive or negative positions in the bond market, and they charge a risk premium for providing this service. In particular, if they have a positive position in the home bond and a negative position in the foreign bond (i.e.,  $d_t^* < 0$ ), they demand a higher expected return on the home bond to earn a positive expected return on their portfolio. Conversely, if they have a negative position in the home bond and a positive position in the foreign bond (i.e.,  $d_t^* > 0$ ), they demand a higher expected return on the foreign bond to earn a positive expected return on their portfolio. In this way, their optimality condition (10.3) implies a tight link between their portfolio position and the currency's expected return.

This mechanism of intermediation in the currency market follows from Gabaix and Maggiori [2015], who provide a different microfoundation in which these liquidity traders are risk-neutral but face a financial friction to incur portfolio imbalances, and this friction is greater when the exchange rate is more volatile. This setting gives rise to an expression similar to Eq. (10.3).

Using the financiers' optimality condition and the market clearing conditions that we will next specify, we can derive the currency expected excess return in equilibrium.

Proposition 10.1. After log-linearization, the currency expected excess return is given by

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] \stackrel {d e f} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*} ] = \chi_ {1} \psi_ {t} - \chi_ {2} \frac {b _ {H , t} \exp (r _ {t})}{\bar {Y}}.
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.42. This proposition relates the required excess return to hold the home currency to the equilibrium quantity of imbalances absorbed that the financiers need to absorb,

which, by market clearing, is further determined by the bond demand of the noise traders  $(\psi_t)$  and that of the local households  $b_{H,t}$ . Specifically, a positive  $\psi_t$  shock means that the financiers have to absorb a large amount of the home bond. They would require a higher compensation to hold the home currency, which increases the home currency's expected excess return. If the home households want to take a large position on the home bond, then, the financiers can offload some of their positions to the home households, which lower the equilibrium position they have to take and thus the risk premium they charge.

Moreover, we can derive an exchange rate accounting formula similar to Proposition 4.2. In this log-linearized model, as we ignore the second-order terms, we effectively attribute all currency expected excess returns to the Euler equation wedge as opposed to the currency risk premium. We obtain

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + j} - r _ {t + j} ^ {*} \right] + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ w _ {t + j} \right] + \bar {e}, \tag {10.4}
$$

where the wedge  $w_{t+j}$  is equal to

$$
w _ {t + j} = \omega \cdot v a r _ {t + j} (\Delta e _ {t + j + 1}) d _ {t + j} ^ {*},
$$

which can be interpreted as the financiers' price of risk,  $\omega$ , multiplied with the quantity of risk they absorb,  $var_{t+j}(\Delta e_{t+j+1}) d_{t+j}^*$ . The home currency is stronger (i.e.,  $e_t$  is higher) when the financiers have to absorb a large amount of the foreign bond (i.e.,  $d_{t+j}^*$  is large) and requires a higher compensation to hold the foreign currency, which can be triggered by a negative  $\psi_t$  shock.

# 10.A.4 Market Clearing Conditions

Since the consumption  $c_{t}$ , the investment  $z_{t}$ , and the intermediate input  $x_{t}$  are all denominated in the home consumption bundle, it is more convenient to first figure out the total amounts of home goods (i.e.,  $y_{H,t}$ ) and foreign goods (i.e.,  $y_{F,t}$ ) that the home households and firms acquire for these objectives. These home and foreign goods are aggregated by the same CES function and satisfy the following resource constraint:

$$
c _ {t} + z _ {t} + x _ {t} = \left[ \alpha^ {1 - \eta} y _ {H, t} ^ {\eta} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \eta} y _ {F, t} ^ {\eta} \right] ^ {1 / \eta}.
$$

Likewise, we have the following resource constraint for the foreign households and firms:

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} + z _ {t} ^ {*} + x _ {t} ^ {*} = \left[ \alpha^ {1 - \eta} (y _ {F, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\eta} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \eta} (y _ {H, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\eta} \right] ^ {1 / \eta},
$$

and the home and foreign goods' market clearing conditions can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l} y _ {t} = y _ {H, t} + y _ {H, t} ^ {*}, \\ y _ {t} ^ {*} = y _ {F, t} + y _ {F, t} ^ {*}. \\ \end{array}
$$

As for the bond market, the home and foreign bonds are in zero net supply. Their market clearing conditions can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = b _ {H, t} \exp (r _ {t}) + d _ {t} + n _ {t}, \\ 0 = b _ {F, t} ^ {*} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) + d _ {t} ^ {*} + n _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ \end{array}
$$

Since the intermediary holds a zero-cost bond portfolio (see Eq. (10.1)), and so does the noise traders (see Eq. (10.2)), and the bonds are in zero supply, then, the market clearing condition implies that the home and foreign households combined must also hold a zero-cost bond portfolio:

$$
b _ {H, t} = - \exp (- e _ {t}) b _ {F, t} ^ {*}.
$$

# 10.A.5 Macro Synthesis

The exogenous variables are the productivity shocks and the noise traders' demand shocks:

$$
(a _ {t}, a _ {t} ^ {*}, \psi_ {t}) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}.
$$

There are 27 endogenous variables in each period  $t$ :

$$
(y _ {t}, y _ {H, t}, y _ {F, t}, c _ {t}, k _ {t}, z _ {t}, x _ {t}, \ell_ {t}, b _ {H, t}, q _ {t}, w _ {t}, r _ {t}, p _ {t}, y _ {t} ^ {*}, y _ {H, t} ^ {*}, y _ {F, t} ^ {*}, c _ {t} ^ {*}, k _ {t} ^ {*}, z _ {t} ^ {*}, x _ {t} ^ {*}, \ell_ {t} ^ {*}, b _ {F, t} ^ {*}, q _ {t} ^ {*}, w _ {t} ^ {*}, r _ {t} ^ {*}, p _ {t} ^ {*}, e _ {t}) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty},
$$

plus two auxiliary variables  $\exp(m_{t+1})$  and  $\exp(m_{t+1}^*)$  that denote the home and foreign SDFs/marginal utility growth:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (m _ {t + 1}) = \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})}, \\ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) = \delta \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1} ^ {*})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The model implies the following 28 equations in each period, one of which is redundant because the market clearing adds up to the sum of households' budget constraints. These 28 equations include 2 consumption aggregation equations,

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {t} + z _ {t} + x _ {t} = \left[ \alpha^ {1 - \eta} y _ {H, t} ^ {\eta} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \eta} y _ {F, t} ^ {\eta} \right] ^ {1 / \eta}, \\ c _ {t} ^ {*} + z _ {t} ^ {*} + x _ {t} ^ {*} = \left[ \alpha^ {1 - \eta} (y _ {F, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\eta} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \eta} (y _ {H, t} ^ {*}) ^ {\eta} \right] ^ {1 / \eta}, \\ \end{array}
$$

# 10.B Comparing Segmented Markets with Convenience Yields

The market segmentation mechanism we develop in the previous section is in fact very similar to the convenience yield model that we considered in Section 7.C. In the model with market segmentation, the households' and the intermediaries' (log-linearized) Euler equations (10.5)-(10.7) imply the following risk-sharing condition:

$$
\chi_ {1} \psi_ {t} - \chi_ {2} \frac {b _ {H , t} \exp (r _ {t})}{\bar {Y}} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} - \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) ], \tag {10.9}
$$

which deviates from the complete-market case  $0 = \Delta e_{t + 1} - (m_{t + 1} - m_{t + 1}^{*})$  in Section 1.C by introducing a wedge on the left-hand side and by introducing the expectation operator so that the condition only holds on average.

If we replace these equations with the following Euler equations from the model with convenience yields:

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {H, t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) \right],
$$

$$
\exp \left(- \lambda_ {F, t}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \tag {10.10}
$$

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {F, t} ^ {*}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right],
$$

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {H, t} ^ {*}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) \right],
$$

change the bond market clearing condition to include the government's supply:

$$
\bar {b} _ {t} = b _ {H, t} + b _ {H, t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
\bar {b} _ {t} ^ {*} = b _ {F, t} + b _ {F, t} ^ {*},
$$

and modify the households' budget conditions accordingly to include both home and foreign bonds, we are very close to recovering the convenience yield model. More precisely, we can log-linearize the above equations in the convenience yield model, and obtain

$$
- \left(\lambda_ {H, t} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t}\right) = - \left(\lambda_ {F, t} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {F, t}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} - \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \right]. \tag {10.11}
$$

Both Eq. (10.9) in the segmented market model and Eq. (10.11) in the convenience yield model introduce a wedge to the risk-sharing condition, which breaks the tight link between the exchange rate and the households' marginal utilities. The difference is that, in the model with market segmentation, the wedge is driven by the portfolio imbalances born by the financiers, whereas in the model with convenience yields, the wedge is driven by the households' demand for safe assets.

# 10.B.1 Comparing the Impulse Responses

To facilitate the comparison between the segmented market model and the convenience yield model, we use similar economic set-up and parameter choices. The two models have identical equilibrium conditions characterizing the goods market clearing, consumption and labor choices, production and investment decisions, and factor prices as listed in Section 10.A.5.

Their only difference is in the asset market. The Euler equations (10.5) to (10.7) in the segmented market model, reproduced below,

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1}}{c _ {t}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (r _ {t}) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {*}) \right],
$$

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \big [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*} \big ] = \chi_ {1} \psi_ {t} - \chi_ {2} \frac {b _ {H , t} \exp (r _ {t})}{\bar {Y}},
$$

are replaced by the Euler equations with convenience yields:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1}}{c _ {t}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (r _ {t}) + \frac {\omega_ {H} b _ {H , t} ^ {- \sigma}}{c _ {t} ^ {- \gamma}} \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1}}{c _ {t}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp \left(- \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) + \frac {\omega_ {F} b _ {F , t} ^ {- \sigma}}{c _ {t} ^ {- \gamma}} \exp (e _ {t}) \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {*}) + \frac {\omega_ {F} ^ {*} (b _ {F , t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \sigma}}{(c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma}} \right], \\ 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (\Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}) + \frac {\omega_ {H} ^ {*} (b _ {H , t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \sigma} + (\bar {c} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma} \theta_ {H , t} ^ {*}}{(c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma}} \exp (- e _ {t}) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

This set of equations, based on Jiang [2023a] that we discussed in Section 7.C, is a simple specification of the general case described by Eq. (10.10). It allows households to freely trade both home and foreign bonds, but introduces the convenience yield wedges in their bond valuations.

Moreover, the bond market clearing conditions are different: the convenience yield model assumes positive net supplies, and replaces Eq. (10.8) in the segmented market model by

$$
b _ {H, t} + b _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \bar {b},
$$

$$
b _ {F, t} ^ {*} + b _ {F, t} = \bar {b} ^ {*}.
$$

The household budget constraints are also slightly different because households can trade foreign bonds in the convenience yield model, but not in the segmented market model.

Table 10.1 reports our parameter choices in the two models. The common parameters describe the real economy which is common to both models. The segmented market parameters describe the parameters related to the intermediated bond market in the segmented market model. These parameters follow from Itskhoki and Mukhin [2021]. The convenience yield parameters describe the parameters related to the bond demand in the convenience yield model, and follow from Jiang [2023a].

Figure 10.1 reports the impulse responses to the  $\psi_t$  shock in the segmented market model and to the  $\lambda_{H,t}$  shock in the convenience yield model. A period represents a quarter, and we plot the responses in the first 25 years. We calibrate the magnitude of the shocks such that they generate the same amount of dollar appreciation in the first period. We choose a persistence parameter of 0.97 for both the noise trading shock and the convenience yield shock, which will make the exchange rate close to a random walk.

Let us begin with the segmented market model. We consider a negative  $\psi_t$  shock, which increases the amount of foreign bond that the financiers have to hold. As the financiers require a higher compensation to hold the foreign currency, the dollar appreciates and the dollar's expected excess return decreases, which are shown in the first row of Figure 10.1. The U.S. bond also becomes relatively more expensive, which lowers its yield relative to the foreign yield.

This is good news for the U.S. households. The second row of Figure 10.1 reports the impulse responses in consumption and production. Real dollar appreciation increases the U.S. households' purchasing power, which increases their relative consumption while incentivizing the foreign households to supply more labor and produce more. As a result, the U.S. consumption increases relative to the foreign consumption, while the U.S. labor and production decline.

The U.S. trade balance  $tb$  also declines as a result.

The third row of Figure 10.1 reports the impulse responses in bond holdings. Because the households can only hold the domestic bond, the U.S. holdings of the foreign bond  $b_{F}$  and the foreign holdings of the U.S. bond  $b_{H}^{*}$  are zero. The noise trading shock also triggers a persistent increase in the foreign households' savings  $b_{F}^{*}$  in the foreign bond and a persistent decline in the U.S. households' savings  $b_{H}$  in the U.S. bond. This has to be understood in conjunction with the households' investment decisions, which we will discuss in the fifth row of this figure. As the foreign households are investing less in the physical capital, more of their savings are channeled into the local bond market.

We can also back out the implied convenience yields from the segmented market model that satisfy the households' Euler equations, which we report in the fourth row. Specifically, we can define the

bonds by construction. A noise trader shock that appreciates the U.S. dollar increases the shadow convenience yield that the foreign households derive from the U.S. bond,  $\lambda_{H,t}^{SM,*}$ , and decreases the shadow convenience yield that the U.S. households derive from the foreign bond,  $\lambda_{F,t}^{SM}$ . These shadow convenience yield adjustments imply that the foreign households must act as if they find it highly desirable to hold the U.S. bond in order to justify why the equilibrium excess return on the dollar is so low.

Finally, in the fifth row of Figure 10.1, we report the impulse responses in the capital, investment, and capital rental price. In response to the noise trading shock, the U.S. households increase their investment in the physical capital relative to the foreign households, which leads to a higher capital stock  $k$  relative to  $k^*$  and a higher investment  $z$  relative to  $z^*$ . As the marginal product of capital is decreasing as the capital stock increases, the capital rental price  $q$  also declines relative to  $q^*$ . These patterns are driven by a discount rate channel: as the U.S. households experience a higher consumption upon the arrival of the noise trading shock, they expect a lower consumption growth rate in the future periods, which lowers their discount rate and makes investment more attractive. As a result, investment and consumption move in tandem.

Now, let us turn to the convenience yield model. We consider a positive  $\theta_{H,t}^{*}$  shock, which increases the foreign households' demand for the U.S. bond. This shock increases the convenience yield that the foreign households derive from the U.S. bond, which also appreciates the dollar, lowers the dollar's expected excess return, and lowers the dollar bond's yield. As we discussed in Section 7.C, this is also good news for the U.S. households, as it increases the U.S. consumption. When we introduce labor and production in this model, dollar appreciation also increases the foreign households' labor supply and production in this model, and decreases the U.S. trade balance. The consumption dynamics also leads the U.S. households to increase investment in the physical capital, and the convenience yield shock also increases the foreign households' convenience yield  $\lambda_{H}^{*}$  on the U.S. bond and decreases the U.S. households' convenience yield  $\lambda_{F}$  on the foreign bond.

In this way, the segmented market model and the convenience yield model generate very similar impulse responses in the exchange rate, interest rate, consumption, production, trade balance, and investment. The main difference lies in the bond market. In the convenience yield model, the foreign households increase their holdings of the U.S. bond  $b_{H}^{*}$ , whereas the U.S. households substitute towards the foreign bond. In the segmented market model, the households do not have access to the bond market in the other country, and the noise

traders instead accumulate a long position on the U.S. bond. So, if we want to distinguish between the two models, it is important to look at the quantities and flows in the bond market, which is a promising direction for future research. For example, do debt holdings by different sectors and by different countries vary systematically with the business cycles? And do they align with the exchange rate movements as predicted by either model?

Moreover, the segmented market model and the convenience yield model also generate different long-run dynamics. For example, while the dollar exchange rate and the U.S.-foreign consumption differential increase persistently upon the shock's arrival in both models, they eventually decline below the steady-state level in the segmented market model, but not in the convenience yield model. To understand this difference, let us recall the net foreign assets (NFA) dynamics (9.4), reproduced below:

$$
n f a _ {t} - n f a _ {t - 1} = t b _ {t} + (i b _ {t} + c g _ {t}).
$$

In both models, the NFA shifts upon the shock's arrival, but it needs to revert to the steady-state level in the long run, which requires adjustments in either the trade balance  $tb$  or the financial flow  $ib + cg$  in subsequent periods. Formally, since  $\lim_{k\to \infty}\mathbb{E}_t[nfa_{t + k}] = \overline{nfa}$ , we can iterate the NFA dynamics (9.4) and obtain

$$
n f a _ {t} = \overline {{n f a}} - \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} [ t b _ {t + k} + (i b _ {t + k} + c g _ {t + k}) ],
$$

which means that if the U.S. runs a negative NFA today, it has to be offset by positive trade balances or by positive financial gains relative to the foreign country [Gourinchas and Rey, 2007a]. In the segmented market model, this is achieved only by the trade channel: the negative U.S. trade balance in the near term is offset by a positive trade balance in the long term. $^{1}$

In the convenience yield model, the valuation effects matter: the negative U.S. NFA is offset by higher financial gains that the U.S. earn from holding the foreign bond relative to what the foreign country earns from holding the U.S. bond, which is precisely the seigniorage revenue that we characterize in Section 7.C. In this case, the U.S. does not have to run positive trade balances in the long term to pay back their trade deficits in the short term. Another place to see this difference is in the NFA dynamics that we plot in the last panel of Figure 10.1. While the U.S. households run trade deficits in both models, they accumulate negative NFA in the segmented market model, which has to be paid back by trade surpluses in the long term. In comparison, the U.S. households do not accumulate a large negative NFA in the convenience yield model, because the trade

In Itskhoki and Mukhin [2021], the model is linearized around a steady state with zero bond positions, which means that the valuation effects  $ib + cg$  are equal to zero in the first order. In extensions with non-zero NFA or nonzero gross positions in the steady state, the valuation effects can matter in the first order.

deficits are funded by the seigniorage revenue. As such, the segmented market model and the convenience yield model emphasize trade vs. financial drivers of the NFA dynamics.

Finally, different microfoundations of the exchange rate wedge can have different policy implications. Under the segmented market view, the government can stabilize the exchange rate by affecting the financiers' balance sheets or their expectation of the currency risk [Itskhoki and Mukhin, 2023]. Under the convenience yield view, exchange rate intervention can take the form of regulating the supply of safe assets, which can be done by either fiscal or monetary policies [Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig, 2020a].

# 10.B.2 The Cyclicality of the Wedge

Given the similarity between the segmented market model and the convenience yield model, how do we think about them? We make three points. First, they both suggest that the wedge in the Euler equations for cross-country bond holdings is an important ingredient to understand exchange rate dynamics. This wedge can have different microfoundations, but they have similar effects that disentangle the exchange rate movement from the households' marginal utilities.

Second, the convenience yield mechanism provides an economic interpretation for the cyclicality of the wedge, because it tends to move in the direction that appreciates the dollar in flight-to-safety episodes. As a result, the wedge does not just produce exchange rate disconnect, it also makes the dollar more counter-cyclical to the global business cycles than other currencies. Moreover, the convenience yield interpretation also offers empirical measurement of the wedge, as we discussed in Section 4.C.

Third, is the bond convenience yield on the dollar bond all there is to the wedge-based view of the exchange rate dynamics? Let us return to the Euler equations (10.10) with slightly different labeling:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right], \\ \exp (- \xi_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right], \\ \exp (- \xi_ {t} ^ {*}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} ^ {*}) \right], \\ \exp \left(- \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

which emphasizes that  $\lambda_{t}$  and  $\lambda_{t}^{*}$  are the non-pecuniary utilities that home and foreign households derive from the U.S. bond, whereas  $\xi_{t}$  and  $\xi_{t}^{*}$  are the non-pecuniary utilities that home and foreign households derive from the foreign bond. Assuming joint normality, Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig [2023a] show the following result.

Proposition 10.2. The exchange rate's conditional cyclicality can be expressed as

$$
c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) + \left(\lambda_ {t} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {t}\right) - \left(\xi_ {t} ^ {*} - \xi_ {t}\right). \tag {10.12}
$$

The proof is presented in Appendix A.43. What is remarkable about this result is that the wedges  $\lambda_{t},\lambda_{t}^{*},\xi_{t},\xi_{t}^{*}$  enter the determination of the exchange rate cyclicity in their levels as opposed to their covariances with the SDFs, so that even a constant wedge can affect the exchange rate cyclicity. This is because the presence of the wedges endogenously requires the exchange rate cyclicity to adjust to be consistent with the Euler equations.

If our objective is to generate a zero or negative covariance between the SDF differential and the exchange rate movement, i.e.,  $cov_{t}(m_{t,t+1} - m_{t,t+1}^{*}, \Delta s_{t+1}) \leq 0$ , which is motivated by the finding that the exchange rate is acyclical or even procyclical with respect to the local business cycles [Backus and Smith, 1993], then, our usual specification of the dollar convenience yield, under which the foreign households derive a higher non-pecuniary utility from the U.S. bond than the U.S. investors, i.e.,

$$
\lambda_ {t} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {t} > 0,
$$

will not suffice. In fact, holding the exchange rate variance constant, a higher convenience yield differential would increase the covariance between the SDF differential and the exchange rate movement.

We need the foreign households to also derive higher convenience yield on the foreign bond than the U.S. households, i.e.,

$$
\left. \xi_ {t} ^ {*} - \xi_ {t} > 0, \right.
$$

which could lower the exchange rate cyclicality and even make it negative, so that the foreign currency depreciates when the foreign marginal utility is high. This condition can be interpreted as the U.S. households finding it very undesirable to hold the foreign bond, which can result from a strong home bias. In fact, we can rewrite Eq. (10.12) as

$$
c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t, t + 1} - m _ {t, t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta s _ {t + 1}\right) = v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta s _ {t + 1}\right) + \left(\lambda_ {t} ^ {*} + \xi_ {t}\right) - \left(\xi_ {t} ^ {*} + \lambda_ {t}\right),
$$

where  $(\lambda_t^* + \xi_t)$  are the Euler equation wedge for cross-country investments from the perspectives of both households, and  $(\xi_t^* + \lambda_t)$  are the Euler equation wedge for domestic investments from the perspectives of both households. A stronger home bias in the form of a negative convenience yield for cross-country investments in either country can make the exchange rate more pro-cyclical with respect to the local business cycles.

Given this discussion, what should a realistic specification of the Euler equation wedges look like? A positive convenience yield on the U.S. bond is still helpful for generating a countercyclical dollar exchange rate to global business cycles, as well as for matching other stylized facts about the dollar's specialness, but a higher degree of home bias is also needed to capture the cyclicality of foreign currencies with respect to their local business cycles. In other words, not only do we need the foreign households to really like the U.S. bond, but we also need the U.S. households to dislike the foreign bonds.

Of course, home bias is an endogenous outcome, which could be driven by many factors in the underlying economy and financial markets. The segmented market set-up we considered in this chapter is potentially one such factor. Another interpretation of the home bias is finance repression, which could also lead the domestic agents to prefer the home bond to the foreign bond and lower the relative desirability of the cross-country investments. For a concrete example, if a country's regulators change the legal framework to make its local bond a better collateral, or a better asset for meeting liquidity requirements, or an asset with more favorable tax treatments, then, the local bond will become more attractive to the local agents.

# 10.B.3 Segmented Markets vs Incomplete Markets

Segmented markets are related to but different from incomplete markets. The literature on the international asset market is moving towards a more precise and refined definition of what assets are available and which agents can trade them.

Incomplete markets usually refer to the case in which the asset space does not span all the shocks, but all agents can trade the available assets. For this reason, we also use the term incomplete spanning to describe this case. In Section 5.A, we considered one such example in which home and foreign households can only trade risk-free bonds which do not span all the shocks.

In comparison, segmented markets usually refer to the case in which, in addition to the possibility that the asset space does not span all the shocks, not all agents can trade the available assets. In Section 10.A, we considered one such example in which the households can only trade the local bond, whereas the financiers can trade both countries' bonds. In this case, the markets are segmented and intermediated.

Note that these two cases are not mutually exclusive. In reality, markets can be both incomplete and segmented. In the recent literature, Sandulescu, Trojani, and Vedolin [2021], Chernov, Haddad, and Itskhoki [2023] study the implications of market segmentation using

model-free approaches. Both papers show that market segmentation breaks the strong link between exchange rates and SDFs, which helps address salient features of international asset returns. In particular, markets in which trading in various instruments (including bonds) is intermediated by various financial actors are likely to be a very relevant case, a point that is in broad agreement with a large macro-finance literature.

# 10.B.4 Other Works

Bruno and Shin [2015a,b] emphasize the role of global banks, who tap dollar funding from financial centers and lend to local banks in foreign countries. When the dollar appreciates, currency mismatch weakens the local banks' balance sheets and contracts their risk-taking capacity. As a result, the dollar's strength impacts global financial conditions and generates dollar shortage in foreign countries. Greenwood, Hanson, Stein, and Sunderam [2020], Gourinchas, Ray, and Vayanos [2022] develop models with financiers who trade in both the currency market and the home and foreign long-term bond markets. The variation in their risk-taking capacity leads to comovements in exchange rates and bond term premia.

The deviation from covered interest rate parity as we discussed in Section 2.A.6 is also a natural place to consider market segmentation and financial intermediation. The key mechanism usually involves constrained financiers and other sectors' imbalanced hedging demand [Borio, Iqbal, McCauley, McGuire, and Sushko, 2018, Andersen, Duffie, and Song, 2019, Avdjiev, Du, Koch, and Shin, 2019, Liao and Zhang, 2020, Amador, Bianchi, Bocola, and Perri, 2020, Cenedese, Della Corte, and Wang, 2021, Rime, Schrimpf, and Syrstad, 2022]

The presence of financial frictions also makes it possible for the policy interventions to improve outcomes and mitigate frictions. See Fanelli and Straub [2020], Bocola and Lorenzoni [2020], Itskhoki and Mukhin [2022]. In the context of the model in Section 10.A, if the policymaker can lower the exchange rate volatility, or at least convince the financiers that the policymaker is committed to interventions that lower the exchange rate volatility, then, the financiers will require a lower currency risk premium to absorb a given amount of portfolio imbalances, which, by Eq. (10.4), will indeed make the exchange rate less volatile.

Empirically, there is a large literature that shows intermediary balance sheet quantities do matter to asset prices [Adrian, Etula, and Muir, 2014, He, Kelly, and Manela, 2017], which is either loosely or precisely related to the equilibrium conditions in models with financial intermediaries.

# 10.C A Model of Domestic Financial Intermediation

Next, we consider a different type of intermediation, which focuses on the market segmentation within a country. To be clear, the 2008 global financial crisis has spurred a large macro-finance literature on domestic financial intermediation. What we focus on here is only one specific type that is useful for thinking about exchange rate dynamics.

This model is a two-country version of Hassan [2013]. We use country-specific tradable goods instead of non-tradable goods to bring the model closer to the baseline model in Section 1.A. This model can be seen as a simplified way of specifying the monetary model by Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe [2002, 2009].

# 10.C.1 Households

We again consider two countries: home and foreign. There is a unit mass of households in each country. We deviate from the baseline model in Section 1.A by assuming that some households do not have access to the financial markets. Specifically, we assume that each country has two types of households: active and inactive.

Active households can trade a complete set of state-contingent claims in international markets. They behave like the households in the complete-market version of the baseline model in Section 1.C. Let  $\phi \in (0,1)$  denote the fraction of these households in each country. We use  $(a)$  to denote the active households. The active households in the home country maximize their expected lifetime utility

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} u (c _ {t} (a)) \right],
$$

and their consumption is a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of home and foreign goods:

$$
c _ {t} (a) = (c _ {H, t} (a)) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {F, t} (a)) ^ {1 - \alpha}.
$$

Inactive households have identical preferences. We use  $(i)$  to denote the inactive households. They maximize their expected lifetime utility

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} u (c _ {t} (i)) \right],
$$

and their consumption is a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of home and foreign goods:

$$
c _ {t} (i) = \left(c _ {H, t} (i)\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(c _ {F, t} (i)\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}.
$$

They cannot trade any financial claims. Instead, they cede their endowments to the active households and receive a stochastic transfer, which is denoted as  $\tau_{t}$  for each inactive household in the home country and  $\tau_{t}^{*}$  for each inactive household in the foreign country. Inactive households can still participate in the goods market, where they use their transfers to purchase home and foreign goods.

Because the active and inactive households in the home country have identical preferences, they face the same within-period problem and will choose the same consumption bundle, which is again identical to the solution in Section 1.A. Therefore, we can use the home consumption bundle to refer to the numérique shared by both types of households.

Let  $p_t$  denote the price of home goods in the home consumption bundle, let  $a_{t-1}(a)$  denote the financial wealth held by the active households, and let  $\exp(r_t^a)$  denote the gross return on this wealth portfolio. The home active households' budget constraint can be expressed as

$$
p _ {t} y _ {t} + \phi a _ {t - 1} (a) \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {a}\right) = \phi \left(c _ {t} (a) + a _ {t} (a)\right) + (1 - \phi) \tau_ {t},
$$

and the home inactive households' budget constraint can be expressed as

$$
(1 - \phi) \tau_ {t} = (1 - \phi) c _ {t} (i).
$$

The active and inactive households in the foreign country are similarly specified. This model simplifies to the complete-market version of the baseline model in Section 1.C when the share of active households approaches 1, i.e.,  $\phi \rightarrow 1$ .

# 10.C.2 The Social Planner's Solution

Because the active households have access to the complete markets, the First Welfare Theorem holds for them. We can again use the social planner approach to derive the equilibrium allocation. Specifically, the social planner maximizes a weighted sum of the active households' welfare:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (\pi u (c _ {t}) + (1 - \pi) u (c _ {t} ^ {*})) \right].
$$

If we only consider the active agents from home and foreign countries, the transfer to the inactive households takes away resources available to them. Effectively, the resources that the social planner allocates between the active households in home and foreign countries are equal to the total endowment minus the transfer. Thus, we can

write the social planner's resource constraints as

$$
y _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \left(c _ {H, t} (i) + c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (i)\right) = \phi \left(c _ {H, t} (a) + c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a)\right),
$$

$$
y _ {t} ^ {*} - (1 - \phi) \left(c _ {F, t} (i) + c _ {F, t} ^ {*} (i)\right) = \phi \left(c _ {F, t} (a) + c _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a)\right),
$$

where we moved the inactive households' consumption to the left-hand side in order to emphasize what is available to the active households.

The social planner's Lagrangian is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (\pi u (c _ {t} (a)) + (1 - \pi) u (c _ {t} ^ {*} (a))) \right. \\ + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {H, t} \left(y _ {t} - \phi \left(c _ {H, t} (a) + c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a)\right) - (1 - \phi) \left(c _ {H, t} (i) + c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (i)\right)\right) \\ \left. + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {F, t} (y _ {t} ^ {*} - \phi (c _ {F, t} (a) + c _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a)) - (1 - \phi) (c _ {F, t} (i) + c _ {F, t} ^ {*} (i))) \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies the following standard first-order conditions

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t} (a): \quad \delta^ {t} \pi u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} (a)) \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {F , t} (a)}{c _ {H , t} (a)}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} = \phi \zeta_ {H, t}, \\ \text {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a): \quad \delta^ {t} (1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*} (a)) (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*} (a)}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*} (a)}\right) ^ {\alpha} = \phi \zeta_ {H, t}, \\ \begin{array}{l l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t} (a): & \delta^ {t} \pi u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} (a)) (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {H , t} (a)}{c _ {F , t} (a)}\right) ^ {\alpha} = \phi \zeta_ {F, t}, \end{array} \\ \text {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a): \quad \delta^ {t} (1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*} (a)) \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*} (a)}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*} (a)}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} = \phi \zeta_ {F, t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

# 10.C.3 Macro Synthesis

The exogenous variables are the endowment shocks and the transfer shocks:

$$
\left(y _ {t}, y _ {t} ^ {*}, \tau_ {t}, \tau_ {t} ^ {*}\right) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}.
$$

There are 14 endogenous variables in each period  $t$ :

$$
\left(c _ {t} (a), c _ {H, t} (a), c _ {F, t} (a), c _ {t} (i), c _ {H, t} (i), c _ {F, t} (i), \zeta_ {H, t}, c _ {t} ^ {*} (a), c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a), c _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a), c _ {t} ^ {*} (i), c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (i), c _ {F, t} ^ {*} (i), \zeta_ {F, t}\right) _ {t = 0} ^ {\infty}.
$$

The model implies the following 14 equations in each period, which include 4 consumption aggregation equations,

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {t} (a) = \left(c _ {H, t} (a)\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(c _ {F, t} (a)\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}, \\ c _ {t} ^ {*} (a) = \left(c _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a)\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a)\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}, \\ c _ {t} (i) = \left(c _ {H, t} (i)\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(c _ {F, t} (i)\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}, \\ c _ {t} ^ {*} (i) = (c _ {F, t} ^ {*} (i)) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (i)) ^ {1 - \alpha}, \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*} (a)}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*} (a)} = \frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*} (i)}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*} (i)}.
$$

This equation system does not contain equilibrium prices such as goods prices and the exchange rate, because the solution to the social planner's problem directly implies the equilibrium allocation. Once we have the equilibrium allocation, we can then use the within-period solutions to solve for the equilibrium prices. As shown in Section 1.C, the optimality conditions for the active households' optimization problem imply that the goods prices are given by

$$
p _ {t} = \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {F , t} (a)}{c _ {H , t} (a)}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

$$
p _ {t} ^ {*} = \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*} (a)}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*} (a)}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha},
$$

and the exchange rate is given by

$$
\pi u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t} (a)\right) = (1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*} (a)\right) \exp \left(e _ {t}\right).
$$

# 10.C.4 Linearized Solution

We use  $\hat{x} = \log (x / \bar{x})$  to denote the log deviation of a variable  $x$  from its steady state  $\bar{x}$ . For example,  $\hat{c}_t(a) = \log (c_t(a) / \bar{c}_t(a))$ . The exchange rate  $\hat{e}_t = e_t - \bar{e}$  is an exception, since it is already in log.

Assume the households have CRRA utility with parameter  $\gamma$ . Below, we take the steady state variables as given and log linearize the system, which includes 4 consumption aggregation equations,

$$

We can easily solve this system of linear equations. The solutions are given by the following proposition. For convenience, we define each country's aggregate consumption as  $c_{t} = \phi c_{t}(a) + (1 - \phi)c_{t}(i)$  and  $c_{t}^{*} = \phi c_{t}^{*}(a) + (1 - \phi)c_{t}^{*}(i)$ .

Proposition 10.3. After the log-linearization, the equilibrium consumption can be expressed as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c} \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) \\ \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a) \\ \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) \\ \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a) \end{array} \right] = A ^ {- 1} \left[ \begin{array}{c} \bar {y} \hat {y} _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {H} (i) \hat {\tau} _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (i) \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*} \\ \bar {y} ^ {*} \hat {y} _ {t} ^ {*} - (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {F} (i) \hat {\tau} _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (i) \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*} \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
$$

where  $A$  is given by

$$
A =
$$

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} \phi \bar {c} _ {H} (a) + (1 - \phi) (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} _ {H} (i) & - (1 - \phi) (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} _ {H} (i) & \phi \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (a) + (1 - \phi) \alpha \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (i) & - (1 - \phi) \alpha \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (i) \\ - (1 - \phi) \alpha \bar {c} _ {F} (i) & \phi \bar {c} _ {F} (a) + (1 - \phi) \alpha \bar {c} _ {F} (i) & - (1 - \phi) (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (i) & \phi \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (a) + (1 - \phi) (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (i) \\ \alpha - 1 - \gamma \alpha & (1 - \gamma) (1 - \alpha) & \alpha + \gamma - \gamma \alpha & (\gamma - 1) \alpha \\ (\gamma - 1) \alpha & \alpha + \gamma - \gamma \alpha & (1 - \gamma) (1 - \alpha) & \alpha - 1 - \gamma \alpha \end{array} \right],
$$

and the total consumption is given by

$$
\hat {c} _ {t} = \phi \bar {c} _ {t} (a) \hat {c} _ {t} (a) + (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {t} (i) \hat {c} _ {t} (i),
$$

$$
\hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} = \phi \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (a) \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (a) + (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (i) \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (i),
$$

the exchange rate is given by

$$
\hat {e} _ {t} = - \gamma \left(\hat {c} _ {t} (a) - \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (a)\right). \tag {10.13}
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.44. This model separates the exchange rate and the aggregate consumption by introducing market segmentation. On the one hand, as the active households have access to the complete markets, their consumption growth is tightly connected to the exchange rate movement as shown in Eq. (10.13). On the other hand, while the inactive households are insulated from the financial markets, their consumption still accounts for a large share of the aggregate consumption, leading to a disconnect between the aggregate consumption and the exchange rate.

We consider a special case in which  $\pi = 1/2$ ,  $\bar{y} = \bar{y}^* = 1$ ,  $\bar{\tau} = \bar{\tau}^* = \alpha^\alpha (1 - \alpha)^{1 - \alpha}$ . In this case, all active and inactive households' steady-state consumption of domestic goods is  $\alpha$  and that of foreign goods is  $1 - \alpha$ :

$$
\bar {c} _ {H} (a) = \bar {c} _ {H} (i) = \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (a) = \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (i) = \alpha ,
$$

$$
\bar {c} _ {F} (a) = \bar {c} _ {F} (i) = \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (a) = \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (i) = 1 - \alpha .
$$

We further assume almost perfect home bias, i.e.,  $\alpha \rightarrow 1$ , and, for simplicity, the following correlation structure:

$$
\rho \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} c o r r _ {t} (\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1}, \hat {y} _ {t + 1}) = c o r r _ {t} (\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \hat {y} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}),
$$

$$
\sigma_ {y} ^ {2} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} v a r _ {t} (\hat {y} _ {t + 1}) = v a r _ {t} (\hat {y} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}),
$$

$$
\sigma_ {\tau} ^ {2} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} v a r _ {t} \left(\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1}\right) = v a r _ {t} \left(\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right).
$$

Then, we obtain the following result:

Proposition 10.4. Under these additional assumptions, the exchange rate and the aggregate consumption growth differential can be expressed as

$$
\hat {e} _ {t} = - \frac {\gamma}{\phi} (\hat {y} _ {t} - \hat {y} _ {t} ^ {*}) + \frac {\gamma}{\phi} (1 - \phi) (\hat {\tau} _ {t} - \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*}),
$$

$$
\hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} - \hat {c} _ {t} = - \left(\hat {y} _ {t} - \hat {y} _ {t} ^ {*}\right),
$$

which implies

$$
\operatorname {c o r r} _ {t} \left(\hat {e} _ {t + 1}, \hat {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \hat {c} _ {t + 1}\right) = \frac {1 - (1 - \phi) \rho \frac {\sigma_ {\tau}}{\sigma_ {y}}}{\sqrt {1 + (1 - \phi) ^ {2} \frac {\sigma_ {\tau} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {y} ^ {2}} - 2 (1 - \phi) \rho \frac {\sigma_ {\tau}}{\sigma_ {y}}}}.
$$

In comparison, the active households' consumption differential can be expressed as

$$
\hat {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {*} (a) - \hat {c} _ {t + 1} (a) = \frac {1}{\phi} [ (\hat {y} _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \hat {y} _ {t + 1}) - (1 - \phi) (\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \hat {\tau} _ {t + 1}) ],
$$

which leads to a Backus-Smith correlation of 1 between the exchange rate and the active households' consumption differential:

$$
c o r r _ {t} \big (\hat {e} _ {t + 1}, \hat {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {*} (a) - \hat {c} _ {t + 1} (a) \big) = 1.
$$

The proof is in Appendix A.45. If there is no inactive households, i.e.,  $\phi = 1$ , then, the consumption growth and exchange rate are perfectly correlated:  $corr_{t}(\hat{e}_{t + 1},\hat{c}_{t + 1}^{*} - \hat{c}_{t + 1}) = 1$ . We obtain the complete-market benchmark in which a low home consumption growth is associated with a high home marginal utility growth and thus a home currency appreciation.

In contrast, if there is a large share of inactive households, i.e.,  $\phi \ll 1$ , then, the Backus-Smith correlation  $corr_{t}(\hat{e}_{t + 1},\hat{c}_{t + 1}^{*} - \hat{c}_{t + 1})$  may become negative. The precondition is to have a sufficiently high correlation between the transfer shock and the endowment shock, and a sufficiently high variance of the transfer shock relative to the endowment shock. More precisely, we may interpret  $\rho \frac{\sigma_{\tau}}{\sigma_y}$  as the beta of the transfer shock with respect to the local endowment shock. When this beta is large enough, i.e.,  $(1 - \phi)\rho \frac{\sigma_{\tau}}{\sigma_y} > 1$ , we obtain a negative Backus-Smith correlation.

In this case, the model resolves the Backus-Smith puzzle by re-interpreting the cyclicality of the households' marginal utilities: a high endowment shock for the entire country is actually a bad, high marginal utility state for the active households who are the marginal investors in the currency market, even though it is good news for the average household which includes the inactive households. As a result, while the Backus-Smith correlation is still positive for the active households' consumption, it is negative for the aggregate consumption. As this difference in the cyclicality of household marginal utility is central to the model's mechanism, it would be interesting to empirically identify the active and inactive households and examine the properties of their profits, losses, and consumption.

This view also implies that the active households to have the opposite cyclicality in their marginal utility growth relative to the domestic

business cycle. These active households usually represent financial intermediaries who invest in the risky assets on behalf of the inactive households. According to Hassan [2013]'s interpretation, the active households underwrite a nominal risk-free bond denominated in the local currency to the inactive households. In good times, low inflation makes the nominal bond valuable, which benefits the inactive households at the expense of the active households. If the active households are sufficiently levered, then, they could lose wealth in good times, leading to a procyclical marginal utility with respect to the domestic business cycle. Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe [2002, 2009] provide a microfoundation for this dynamics, in which the identities of active and inactive households are endogenously determined by the households' holdings.

# 10.C.5 Other Works

Market segmentation and financial intermediation have been studied extensively in the macro-finance literature. He and Krishnamurthy [2013], Brunnermeier and Sannikov [2014] present two prominent models of financial frictions in closed economies. In the international literature, Chien and Naknoi [2015] propose a segmented market model in which not all households can participate in the equity market, but the participation rate is higher in the U.S. Maggiori [2017] also considers a model with credit constraints for financial intermediaries, in which the U.S. intermediaries are less constrained. In these models, the U.S. as a whole loads up more aggregate risk than the foreign country, which speaks to the asymmetry in global portfolio allocation we discussed in Chapter 7. Chien, Lustig, and Naknoi [2020] use a similar segmented market mechanism to resolve the exchange rate volatility puzzle we discussed in Section 2.A.1, that the exchange rate movement can be smooth even when the SDFs are volatile and the macro fundamentals are only weakly correlated, and Dou and Verdelhan [2015] use segmented markets to explain the volatility of international capital flows. Fang and Liu [2021] also consider a two-country model with within-country financial intermediation, with the key ingredient being the value-at-risk (VaR) constraint. The model speaks quantitatively to the exchange rate volatility, cyclicality, risk premium, and the deviations from the covered interest rate parity.

Jiang and Richmond [2023b] introduce global production network to this model with active and inactive households. The transfer shock from active to inactive households can be interpreted as a demand shock that is transmitted in the global trade network, which, as we saw in Section 3.C, plays an important role in shaping the comove

ments of exchange rates.

# Proof of Selected Results

# A.1 Proposition 1.3 in Section 1.C

Proof. Recall the first-order conditions

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t}: \quad \delta^ {t} \pi u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} = \zeta_ {H, t} \\ \begin{array}{l l} \text {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t} ^ {*}: & \delta^ {t} (1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {\alpha} = \zeta_ {H, t} \end{array} \\ \text {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t}: \quad \delta^ {t} \pi u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) (1 - \alpha) \left(\frac {c _ {H , t}}{c _ {F , t}}\right) ^ {\alpha} = \zeta_ {F, t} \\ \text {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t} ^ {*}: \quad \delta^ {t} (1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} = \zeta_ {F, t} \\ \end{array}
$$

multiply the first and the last first-order conditions and divide it by the product of the second and third first-order conditions to get

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}} \frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t}} \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{(1 - \alpha) ^ {2}} = 1 \\ \Rightarrow \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \frac {c _ {H , t}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}} \\ \end{array}
$$

Let

$$
\begin{array}{l} k _ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \frac {c _ {H , t}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}} \\ \Rightarrow c _ {H, t} = \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} k _ {t} c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, \quad c _ {F, t} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} k _ {t} c _ {F, t} ^ {*} \\ \end{array}
$$

Plugging the equations above into the market clearing conditions yields

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {H, t} = \frac {\alpha k _ {t}}{(1 - \alpha) + \alpha k _ {t}} y _ {t}, \quad c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{(1 - \alpha) + \alpha k _ {t}} y _ {t}, \\ c _ {F, t} = \frac {(1 - \alpha) k _ {t}}{\alpha + (1 - \alpha) k _ {t}} y _ {t} ^ {*}, \quad c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\alpha}{\alpha + (1 - \alpha) k _ {t}} y _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ \end{array}
$$

Divide the first first-order condition by the second to get

$$
\frac {\pi}{1 - \pi} \frac {u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})} \frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \left(\frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} \left(\frac {c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {\alpha} = 1.
$$

where  $c_{H,t}, c_{F,t}, c_{H,t}^{*}$  and  $c_{F,t}^{*}$  are functions of  $k_{t}$ . Hence, we can solve

$k_{t}$  via the implicit equation above.

# A.2 Proposition 1.4 in Section 1.D

Proof. Under symmetric steady state,  $\bar{y}^{*} = \bar{y}$ ,  $\bar{e} = 0$ ,  $\bar{c}_{H} = \bar{c}_{F}^{*}$ ,  $\bar{c}_{F} = \bar{c}_{H}^{*}$  and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \bar {c} _ {H} + \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} = \bar {y}, \quad \bar {c} _ {F} + \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} = \bar {y} ^ {*}, \\ \bar {p} \bar {c} _ {H} = \alpha \bar {c}, \quad \bar {p} ^ {*} \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} = \alpha \bar {c} ^ {*}, \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies  $\bar{c}_H = \bar{c}_F^* = \alpha \bar{y},\bar{c}_H^* = \bar{c}_F = (1 - \alpha)\bar{y},\bar{c} = \bar{c}^* =$

$\alpha^{\alpha}(1 - \alpha)^{1 - \alpha}\bar{y}$  and  $\bar{p} = \bar{p}^{*} = \alpha^{\alpha}(1 - \alpha)^{1 - \alpha}$ . The goods market clearing

conditions plus the equilibrium conditions (1.4) and (1.5) imply

$$
\begin{array}{l} p _ {t} y _ {t} = \alpha c _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) c _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}), \\ p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} = \alpha c _ {t} ^ {*} + (1 - \alpha) c _ {t} \exp (e _ {t}). \\ \end{array}
$$

Log linearize around the symmetric steady state to obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} \bar {p} \bar {y} (\log p _ {t} - \log \bar {p} + \log y _ {t} - \log \bar {y}) = \alpha \bar {c} (\log c _ {t} - \log \bar {c}) + (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} ^ {*} \exp (- \bar {e}) (\log c _ {t} ^ {*} - \log \bar {c} ^ {*} - e _ {t} + \bar {e}) \\ \bar {p} ^ {*} \bar {y} ^ {*} (\log p _ {t} ^ {*} - \log \bar {p} ^ {*} + \log y _ {t} ^ {*} - \log \bar {y}) = \alpha \bar {c} ^ {*} (\log c _ {t} ^ {*} - \log \bar {c} ^ {*}) + (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} \exp (\bar {e}) (\log c _ {t} - \log \bar {c} + e _ {t} - \bar {e}) \\ \end{array}
$$

subtracting the second equation from the first and plugging in steady

states yields

$$
\bar {p} \bar {y} (\log y _ {t} - \log y _ {t} ^ {*}) + \bar {p} \bar {y} (\log p _ {t} - \log p _ {t} ^ {*}) = (2 \alpha - 1) \bar {c} (\log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*}) - 2 (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} e _ {t}
$$

recall that  $e_t = (2\alpha - 1)tot_t$ , where  $tot_t = \log p_t - \log p_t^* + e_t$ , hence

$\log p_t - \log p_t^* = (2 - 2\alpha) / (2\alpha -1)e_t$  , and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \bar {p} \bar {y} \left(\log y _ {t} - \log y _ {t} ^ {*}\right) + \bar {p} \bar {y} \frac {2 - 2 \alpha}{2 \alpha - 1} e _ {t} = (2 \alpha - 1) \bar {c} \left(\log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) - 2 (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} e _ {t} \\ (2 \alpha - 1) (\log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*}) - 2 (1 - \alpha) e _ {t} - \frac {2 - 2 \alpha}{2 \alpha - 1} e _ {t} = \log y _ {t} - \log y _ {t} ^ {*} \\ (2 \alpha - 1) \left(\log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) - 2 (1 - \alpha) \frac {2 \alpha}{2 \alpha - 1} e _ {t} = \log y _ {t} - \log y _ {t} ^ {*} \\ \end{array}
$$

where we plug in  $\bar{p}\bar{y} = \bar{c}$

# A.3 Proposition 3.1 in Section 3.A

Proof. Plug in

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} \right] = - \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {\S}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \left(\sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {\S}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {\S}\right)
$$

in the expression of  $hml_{t+1}$  yields

$$
\begin{array}{l} h m l _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ h m l _ {t + 1} \right] = - \frac {1}{N _ {H}} \sum_ {i \in H} \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {\S}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \frac {1}{N _ {H}} \sum_ {i \in H} \left(\sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {\S}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {\S}\right) \\ + \frac {1}{N _ {L}} \sum_ {i \in L} \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {\S}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} + \frac {1}{N _ {L}} \sum_ {i \in L} \left(\sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {\S}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {\S}\right) \\ = \left(\sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {L}} - \sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {H}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \frac {1}{N _ {H}} \sum_ {i \in H} \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} + \frac {1}{N _ {L}} \sum_ {i \in L} \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} \\ = \left(\overline {{\sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {L}}}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {H}}}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} \\ \end{array}
$$

The country-specific shock terms,  $\frac{1}{N_H}\sum_{i\in H}\sqrt{\gamma z_t^i}\varepsilon_{t + 1}^i$  and  $\frac{1}{N_L}\sum_{i\in L}\sqrt{\gamma z_t^i}\varepsilon_{t + 1}^i$  averages out according to the law of large numbers. Hence,

$$
r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} = r p _ {t} ^ {i / \S} + \frac {\sqrt {\delta^ {\S}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {i}}}{\sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {L}} - \sqrt {\delta_ {t} ^ {H}}} \left(h m l _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ h m l _ {t + 1} \right]\right) - \left(\sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {\S}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {\S}\right)
$$

which shows that  $\beta_t^i$  is the carry trade loading on  $hml_{t+1}$

# A.4 Proposition 3.2 in Section 3.A

Proof. Recall that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \mathbb {S}} = - \left(\mu_ {t} ^ {i} - \mu_ {t} ^ {\mathbb {S}}\right) - \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {\mathbb {S}}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \left(\sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {\mathbb {S}}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {\mathbb {S}}\right) \\ = - \chi \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {\S}\right) - \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {\S}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \left(\sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {\S}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {\S}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

and

$$
r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$} = \left(\chi - \frac {1}{2} \gamma\right) \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {\$}\right) - \frac {1}{2} \left(\delta^ {i} - \delta^ {\$}\right) z _ {t} ^ {w}.
$$

Note that  $z_{t}^{w}$  is uncorrelated  $z_{t}^{i}$  and  $z_{t}^{\S}$ . Hence,

$$
v a r (r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$}) = \left(\chi - \frac {1}{2} \gamma\right) ^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {\$}) + \frac {1}{4} \left(\delta^ {i} - \delta^ {\$}\right) ^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {w})
$$

$$
c o v (\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S}, r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S}) = - \chi \left(\chi - \frac {1}{2} \gamma\right) v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {\S})
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} c o v (r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S}, r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S}) = c o v (\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} + r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S}, r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S}) \\ = c o v \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \$}, r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$}\right) + v a r \left(r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\$}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

Assuming  $z_{t}^{i}$  and  $z_{t}^{\S}$  are also independent,

$$
v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {\$}) = v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + v a r (z _ {t} ^ {\$}).

\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / j} = - \chi \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {j}\right) - \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {j}}\right) \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w} - \left(\sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} - \sqrt {\gamma z _ {t} ^ {j}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {j}\right)
$$

Note that  $z_{t}^{i}, z_{t}^{j}, z_{t}^{w}, \varepsilon_{t+1}^{i}, \varepsilon_{t+1}^{j}, \varepsilon_{t+1}^{w}$  are independent for  $i \neq j$ . By the law of large numbers,

$$
c o v (z _ {t} ^ {i} - \overline {{z}} _ {t}, z _ {t} ^ {i} - z _ {t} ^ {j}) = v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) - \frac {1}{N} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + \frac {1}{N} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {j}) = v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i})
$$

$$
v a r \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} - \bar {z} _ {t}\right) = v a r \left(z _ {t} ^ {i}\right) - \frac {2}{N} v a r \left(z _ {t} ^ {i}\right) + \frac {1}{N ^ {2}} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} v a r \left(z _ {t} ^ {j}\right) = v a r \left(z _ {t} ^ {i}\right)
$$

$$
c o v (\sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i}, z _ {t} ^ {i}) = \mathbb {E} \left[ z _ {t} ^ {i} \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} \right] - \mathbb {E} \left[ z _ {t} ^ {i} \right] \mathbb {E} \left[ \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i} \right] = 0
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {v a r} \left(\sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w}\right) = \mathbb {E} \left[ z _ {t} ^ {w} \left(\varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w}\right) ^ {2} \right] - \left(\mathbb {E} \left[ \sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {w}} \left(\varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w}\right) \right]\right) ^ {2} \\ = \mathbb {E} \left[ z _ {t} ^ {w} \right] \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(\varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {w}\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ = \theta^ {w} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\operatorname {v a r} \left(\sqrt {z _ {t} ^ {i}} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {i}\right) = \theta
$$

Hence,

$$
c o v (\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / j}, \Delta \bar {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}) = \chi^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {j}}\right) \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta}}}\right) \theta^ {w} + \gamma \theta
$$

$$
v a r (\Delta \overline {{e}} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}) = \chi^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta}}}\right) ^ {2} \theta^ {w} + \gamma \theta
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} v a r \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / j}\right) = \chi^ {2} \left(v a r \left(z _ {t} ^ {i}\right) + v a r \left(z _ {t} ^ {j}\right)\right) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {j}}\right) ^ {2} \theta^ {w} + 2 \gamma \theta \\ \varphi = \frac {c o v (\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / j} , \Delta \vec {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {i})}{v a r (\Delta \vec {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {i})} \\ = 1 - \frac {\left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta}}}\right) \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {j}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta}}}\right) \theta^ {w}}{\chi^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \overline {{\sqrt {\delta}}}\right) ^ {2} \theta^ {w} + \gamma \theta}, \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} R ^ {2} = \frac {\varphi^ {2} v a r (\Delta \overline {{e}} _ {t + 1} ^ {i})}{v a r (\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / j})} \\ = \frac {\left[ \chi^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {j}}\right) \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta}\right) \theta^ {w} + \gamma \theta \right] ^ {2}}{\left[ \chi^ {2} v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta}\right) ^ {2} \theta^ {w} + \gamma \theta \right] \left[ \chi^ {2} (v a r (z _ {t} ^ {i}) + v a r (z _ {t} ^ {j})) + \left(\sqrt {\delta^ {i}} - \sqrt {\delta^ {j}}\right) ^ {2} \theta^ {w} + 2 \gamma \theta \right]}. \\ \end{array}

# A.6 Proposition 3.4 in Section 3.B

Proof. The Euler equation for the consumption claim implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t + 1} ^ {c}\right) \right], \\ 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + 1} ^ {c} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (r _ {t + 1} ^ {c}) + c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}, r _ {t + 1} ^ {c}). \\ \end{array}
$$

Define  $r_0^c = \kappa_0^c + \mu_g + \mu_{wc}(1 - \kappa_1^c)$ . The log-linearization of the log total wealth return around the long-run average wealth consumption ratio can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t + 1} ^ {c} = \kappa_ {0} ^ {c} + \Delta c _ {t + 1} + \log \left(w c _ {t + 1}\right) - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c} \log \left(w c _ {t}\right) \\ = \kappa_ {0} ^ {c} + \mu_ {g} + x _ {t} + \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} + \mu_ {w c} + W _ {x} x _ {t + 1} + W _ {\sigma} \left(\sigma_ {t + 1} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}\right) - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c} \left(\mu_ {w c} + W _ {x} x _ {t} + W _ {\sigma} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}\right)\right) \\ = r _ {0} ^ {c} + x _ {t} + \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} + W _ {x} \left(\rho x _ {t} + \sigma_ {t} \varphi_ {e} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1}\right) + W _ {\sigma} \left(\phi \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}\right) + \omega \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1}\right) - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c} \left(W _ {x} x _ {t} + W _ {\sigma} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}\right)\right) \\ = r _ {0} ^ {c} + \left[ 1 + W _ {x} \left(\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right) \right] x _ {t} + W _ {\sigma} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}\right) \left(\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right) + \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} + W _ {x} \sigma_ {t} \varphi_ {e} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} + W _ {\sigma} \omega \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + 1} ^ {c} \right] = r _ {0} ^ {c} + \left[ 1 + W _ {x} \left(\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right) \right] x _ {t} + W _ {\sigma} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}\right) \left(\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right)
$$

$$
r _ {t + 1} ^ {c} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + 1} ^ {c} \right] = \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} + W _ {x} \sigma_ {t} \varphi_ {e} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} + W _ {\sigma} \omega \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1}

$$

Define  $\mu_{s} = \theta \log \delta + (\theta - 1)r_{0}^{c} - \frac{\theta}{\psi}\mu_{g}$ . Recall that  $\theta(1 - 1/\psi) = 1 - \gamma$ . Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l} m _ {t + 1} = \theta \log \delta - \frac {\theta}{\psi} \Delta c _ {t + 1} + (\theta - 1) r _ {t + 1} ^ {c} \\ = \mu_ {s} - \frac {\theta}{\psi} \left(x _ {t} + \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1}\right) \\ + (\theta - 1) \left\{[ 1 + W _ {x} (\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) ] x _ {t} + W _ {\sigma} (\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}) (\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) + \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} + W _ {x} \sigma_ {t} \varphi_ {e} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} + W _ {\sigma} \omega \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1} \right\} \\ = \mu_ {s} + \left\{- \frac {\theta}{\psi} + (\theta - 1) [ 1 + W _ {x} \left(\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right) ] \right\} x _ {t} - \gamma \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} \\ + \left\{W _ {\sigma} \left(\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right) (\theta - 1) \right\} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}\right) + (\theta - 1) \left\{W _ {x} \sigma_ {t} \varphi_ {e} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} + W _ {\sigma} \omega \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1} \right\} \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} m _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] = - \gamma \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} + (\theta - 1) \left\{W _ {x} \sigma_ {t} \varphi_ {e} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} + W _ {\sigma} \omega \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1} \right\} \\ \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] = \mu_ {s} + \left\{- \frac {\theta}{\psi} + (\theta - 1) [ 1 + W _ {x} (\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) ] \right\} x _ {t} + \{W _ {\sigma} (\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) (\theta - 1) \} (\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}) \\ \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \left(- \gamma \sigma_ {t} \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} + (\theta - 1) \left\{W _ {x} \sigma_ {t} \varphi_ {e} \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} + W _ {\sigma} \omega \varepsilon_ {w, t + 1} \right\}\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ = \gamma^ {2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} + (\theta - 1) ^ {2} \left\{W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi_ {e} ^ {2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} + W _ {\sigma} ^ {2} \omega^ {2} \right\} - 2 \nu \gamma (\theta - 1) W _ {x} \varphi_ {e} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, r _ {t + 1} ^ {c}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \left(r _ {t + 1} ^ {c} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {0} ^ {c} \right]\right) \left(m _ {t + 1} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ m _ {t + 1} \right]\right) \right] \\ = - \gamma \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} + W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi_ {e} ^ {2} (\theta - 1) \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} + W _ {\sigma} ^ {2} (\theta - 1) \omega^ {2} + \nu (- \gamma + \theta - 1) W _ {x} \varphi_ {e} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Now plugging all the components into the Euler equation,

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = r _ {0} ^ {c} + \mu_ {s} \\ + \frac {\theta^ {2}}{2} \left\{W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi_ {e} ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} + W _ {\sigma} ^ {2} \omega^ {2} \right\} + \theta \left\{- \frac {1}{\psi} + [ 1 + W _ {x} (\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) ] \right\} x _ {t} + \frac {\theta}{2} \left\{2 W _ {\sigma} (\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) + \theta W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi_ {e} ^ {2} \right\} (\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}) \\ + \frac {1}{2} (1 - \gamma) ^ {2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} + \theta \nu (1 - \gamma) W _ {x} \varphi_ {e} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

As this equation holds for any  $x_{t}$  and  $\sigma_t^2$

$$
r _ {0} ^ {c} + \mu_ {s} + \frac {\theta^ {2}}{2} \left\{W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi_ {e} ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} + W _ {\sigma} ^ {2} \omega^ {2} \right\} - W _ {\sigma} \theta (\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) \sigma^ {2} = 0 \tag {A.1}
$$

$$
\theta \left\{- \frac {1}{\psi} + \left[ 1 + W _ {x} \left(\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right) \right] \right\} = 0 \tag {A.2}
$$

$$
\frac {1}{2} (1 - \gamma) ^ {2} + \frac {\theta}{2} \left\{2 W _ {\sigma} \left(\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right) + \theta W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi_ {e} ^ {2} \right\} + \theta \nu (1 - \gamma) W _ {x} \varphi_ {e} = 0 \tag {A.3}
$$

which implies

$$
W _ {x} = \frac {1 - \frac {1}{\psi}}{\kappa_ {1} ^ {c} - \rho}
$$

$$
W _ {\sigma} = \frac {(1 - \gamma) (1 - \frac {1}{\psi})}{2 \left(\kappa_ {1} ^ {c} - \phi\right)} \left(\frac {\varphi_ {e} ^ {2}}{\left(\kappa_ {1} ^ {c} - \rho\right) ^ {2}} + \frac {2 \nu \varphi_ {e}}{\kappa_ {1} ^ {c} - \rho} + 1\right)
$$

Furthermore, we can solve additionally for  $r_0^c$ ,  $\kappa_0^c$ ,  $\kappa_1^c$  and  $\mu_{wc}$ , using Eq. (A.1) and

$$
\kappa_ {0} ^ {c} = - \log \left(e ^ {\mu_ {w c}} - 1\right) + \frac {e ^ {\mu_ {w c}}}{e ^ {\mu_ {w c}} - 1} \mu_ {w c}
$$

$$
\kappa_ {1} ^ {c} = \frac {e ^ {\mu_ {w c}}}{e ^ {\mu_ {w c}} - 1}
$$

$$
r _ {0} ^ {c} = \kappa_ {0} ^ {c} + \mu_ {g} + \mu_ {w c} (1 - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c})
$$

and the currency risk premium is

Also, from the Euler equations for risk-free bonds,

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t} = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) \\ = - \left\{\mu_ {s} + \left\{- \frac {\theta}{\psi} + (\theta - 1) \left[ 1 + W _ {x} \left(\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right) \right] \right\} x _ {t} + \left\{W _ {\sigma} \left(\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}\right) (\theta - 1) \right\} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \sigma^ {2}\right) \right\} \\ - \frac {1}{2} \left\{\gamma^ {2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} + (\theta - 1) ^ {2} W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi_ {e} ^ {2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} + (\theta - 1) ^ {2} W _ {\sigma} ^ {2} \omega^ {2} \right\} + \nu \gamma (\theta - 1) W _ {x} \varphi_ {e} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}

also compute the interest rate differential as

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*} = \left\{- \frac {\theta}{\psi} + (\theta - 1) [ 1 + W _ {x} (\rho - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) ] \right\} (x _ {t} ^ {*} - x _ {t}) \\ + \left\{\{W _ {\sigma} (\phi - \kappa_ {1} ^ {c}) (\theta - 1) \} + \frac {1}{2} \gamma^ {2} + \frac {1}{2} (\theta - 1) ^ {2} W _ {x} ^ {2} \varphi^ {2} - \nu \gamma (\theta - 1) W _ {x} \varphi \right\} (\sigma_ {t} ^ {* 2} - \sigma_ {t} ^ {2}) \\ \end{array}

From here, we assume the following for the derivations below:

$$
\begin{array}{l} c o v _ {t} \left(\varepsilon_ {g, t + 1} ^ {*}, \varepsilon_ {g, t + 1}\right) \neq 0 \\ c o v _ {t} \left(\varepsilon_ {x, t + 1} ^ {*}, \varepsilon_ {x, t + 1}\right) \neq 0 \\ c o v _ {t} \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {*}, \sigma_ {t}\right) \neq 0 \\ \end{array}

# A.8 Proposition 3.6 in Section 3.C

Proof. Within period  $t$ , the social planner's Lagrangian is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \pi^ {i} \left(\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} v _ {i j} \log c _ {j} ^ {i}\right) + \varphi^ {i} \left(a ^ {i} \left(\ell^ {i}\right) ^ {\theta} \left(\prod_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(x _ {j} ^ {i}\right) ^ {w _ {i j}}\right) - \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(c _ {i} ^ {j} + x _ {i} ^ {j}\right) - d ^ {i}\right) \\ + \chi^ {i} (\bar {\ell} ^ {i} - \ell^ {i}) \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies the following first-order conditions:

$$
w. r. t. c _ {i} ^ {j}: \quad \pi^ {j} v _ {j i} \left(c _ {i} ^ {j}\right) ^ {- 1} = \varphi^ {i} \tag {A.4}
$$

$$
w. r. t. x _ {i} ^ {j}: \quad \varphi^ {j} \bar {x} ^ {j} w _ {j i} \left(x _ {i} ^ {j}\right) ^ {- 1} = \varphi^ {i} \tag {A.5}
$$

$$
w. r. t. \ell^ {i}: \quad \varphi^ {i} \bar {x} ^ {i} \theta \left(\ell^ {i}\right) ^ {- 1} = \chi^ {i} \tag {A.6}
$$

Substitute into the market clearing condition:

$$
\varphi^ {i} \bar {x} ^ {i} - d ^ {i} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(\pi^ {j} v _ {j i} + \varphi^ {j} \bar {x} ^ {j} w _ {j i}\right).
$$

Define  $\gamma^i = \varphi^i\overline{x}^i$ . It can be interpreted as the value of country  $i$ 's total output, because the Lagrangian multiplier  $\varphi^i$  can be interpreted as the price of country  $i$ 's intermediate goods in a common numérique. The market clearing condition becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l} \gamma^ {i} - d ^ {i} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \left(\pi^ {j} v _ {j i} + \gamma^ {j} w _ {j i}\right) \\ \gamma - d = V ^ {\prime} \pi + W ^ {\prime} \gamma \\ \gamma = \left(I - W ^ {\prime}\right) ^ {- 1} (V ^ {\prime} \pi + d) = H ^ {\prime} \pi + \left(I - W ^ {\prime}\right) ^ {- 1} d. \\ \end{array}
$$

Then, the log production is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log \bar {x} ^ {i} = \log a ^ {i} + \theta \log \ell^ {i} + \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} w _ {i j} \log \left(\frac {\varphi^ {i} \bar {x} ^ {i}}{\varphi^ {j}} w _ {i j}\right) \\ = \log a ^ {i} + \theta \log \ell^ {i} + \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} w _ {i j} \log \left(\frac {\gamma^ {i}}{\gamma^ {j} / \bar {x} ^ {j}} w _ {i j}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log \bar {x} = \kappa^ {x} + \log a + (1 - \theta) \log \gamma + W (\log \bar {x} - \log \gamma) \\ = (I - W) ^ {- 1} \left(\kappa^ {x} + \log a - \theta \log \gamma\right) + \log \gamma \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\kappa^x = \theta \log \ell^i + \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{ij} \log w_{ij}$  is a vector of constants.

Define  $H = V(I - W)^{-1}$ . The log consumption of active households is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log \bar {c} ^ {i} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} v _ {i j} \log \left(\frac {\pi^ {i} v _ {i j}}{\gamma^ {j}} \bar {x} ^ {j}\right) \\ \log \bar {c} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} v _ {i j} \log \left(\pi^ {i} v _ {i j}\right) + V \log \bar {x} - V \log \gamma \\ = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} v _ {i j} \log \left(\pi^ {i} v _ {i j}\right) + H (\kappa^ {x} + \log a - \theta \log \gamma) \\ = \kappa^ {c} + H (\log a - \theta \log (H ^ {\prime} \pi + (I - W ^ {\prime}) ^ {- 1} d)) \\ \end{array}
$$

Let  $L = (I - W')^{-1}$ . Denote  $L_{i}$  the  $i$ -th row of  $L$ . Since

$$
\frac {\partial \{\log (H ^ {\prime} \pi + L d) \} _ {i}}{\partial d} = \frac {\partial \log (\{H ^ {\prime} \pi \} _ {i} + L _ {i} d)}{\partial d} = \frac {1}{\{H ^ {\prime} \pi \} _ {i} + L _ {i} d} L
$$

we can apply a first-order approximation at  $d = 0$ , and obtain

$$
\{\log (\overline {{\gamma}} + L d) \} _ {i} \approx \log \{H ^ {\prime} \pi \} _ {i} + \frac {1}{\{H ^ {\prime} \pi \} _ {i}} L d
$$

We define  $\frac{\theta}{H' \pi}$  as a diagonal matrix whose element  $(i, i)$  is  $\frac{\theta}{\{H' \pi\}_i}$ . Then,

$$
\log \bar {c} = \kappa^ {c} + H \left(\log a - \frac {\theta}{H ^ {\prime} \pi} (I - W ^ {\prime}) ^ {- 1} d\right)
$$

# A.9 Proposition 3.7 in Section 3.C

Proof. The covariance of consumption growth follows directly from Eq. (3.12):

$$
c o v \big (\Delta \log \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {i}, \Delta \log \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {j} \big) = \mathcal {C} (i, j).
$$

The moments of exchange rates follow from the covariance of consumption growth. In particular, the covariance between the changes in currency base factors is

$$
\begin{array}{l} c o v \left(\Delta \bar {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}, \Delta \bar {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {j}\right) = c o v \left(\frac {1}{N} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {N} \Delta \bar {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {k} - \Delta \bar {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}, \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {N} \Delta \bar {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {k} - \Delta \bar {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {j}\right) \\ = \mathcal {C} (i, j) - \overline {{\mathcal {C}}} (i) - \overline {{\mathcal {C}}} (j) + \kappa^ {e}. \\ \end{array}
$$

# A.10 Proposition 3.8 in Section 3.C

Proof. The log SDF is given by:

$$
\begin{array}{l} m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} = \log \left(\delta \frac {\bar {c} _ {t}}{\bar {c} _ {t + 1}}\right) \\ = \log \delta - \Delta \log \bar {c} _ {t + 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

As shown in Section 1.B, the log interest rate and currency risk premium are given by:

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t} ^ {i} = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ m _ {t + 1} ^ {i} \right] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {i}\right) \\ = - \log \delta - H \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta \log a _ {t + 1} ] + H \frac {\theta}{H ^ {\prime} \pi} (I - W ^ {\prime}) ^ {- 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta d _ {t + 1} ] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta \log \bar {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}) \\ = - \log \delta - \frac {1}{2} \mathcal {C} (i, i) \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} r p _ {t} ^ {i / \$} \stackrel {{\mathrm {d e f}}} {{=}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r x _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \$} \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ - e _ {t + 1} ^ {i / \S} \right] + r _ {t} ^ {i} - r _ {t} ^ {\S} \\ = - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {i}\right) + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {\S}\right) \\ = \frac {1}{2} \left(\mathcal {C} (\mathrm {\$}, \mathrm {\$}) - \mathcal {C} (i, i)\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

where we set  $\mathbb{E}_t[\Delta \log a_{t + 1}] = \mathbb{E}_t[\Delta d_{t + 1}] = 0$

# A.11 Proposition 3.9 in Section 3.D

Proof. The long term bond return and price are given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (- r _ {t} (h) h) = p _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t, t + h} ^ {P} + m _ {t, t + h} ^ {T}) ] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m c _ {t + h} ^ {P} - m c _ {t} ^ {P} + m c _ {t + h} ^ {T} - m c _ {t} ^ {T}) ] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} \left(- \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {P} \varepsilon_ {t + k} ^ {P}\right) \right. \right. \\ \left. \left. + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} \phi^ {h - k} \bar {m c} ^ {T} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} \phi^ {h - k} (t + k) \log \beta + (\phi^ {h} - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} \left(\phi^ {h - k} \sigma_ {T} \varepsilon_ {t + k} ^ {T}\right)\right) \right] \\ = \exp \left(\frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + \left(\frac {t + h - \phi^ {h} (t + 1)}{1 - \phi} - \frac {\phi - \phi^ {h}}{(1 - \phi) ^ {2}}\right) \log \beta + (\phi^ {h} - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} \right. \\ \left. + \frac {1 - \phi^ {2 h}}{2 - 2 \phi^ {2}} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \sigma_ {T P}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

Hence,

$$
- r _ {t} (h) h = \frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + \left(\frac {t + h - \phi^ {h} (t + 1)}{1 - \phi} - \frac {\phi - \phi^ {h}}{(1 - \phi) ^ {2}}\right) \log \beta + (\phi^ {h} - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} + \frac {1 - \phi^ {2 h}}{2 - 2 \phi^ {2}} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \sigma_ {T P},
$$

$$
\left(r _ {t} (h) + \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi}\right) h = - \frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} - \left(\frac {t - \phi^ {h} (t + 1)}{1 - \phi} - \frac {\phi - \phi^ {h}}{(1 - \phi) ^ {2}}\right) \log \beta - (\phi^ {h} - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} - \frac {1 - \phi^ {2 h}}{2 - 2 \phi^ {2}} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} - \frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \sigma_ {T P},
$$

which implies that the constant  $\tilde{\delta} = \beta^{1/(1-\phi)}$  satisfies  $0 < \lim_{h\to \infty}p_t(h) / \tilde{\delta}^h < \infty$ , and the long-term bond yield satisfies

$$
\lim_{h\to \infty}r_{t}(h) + \log \tilde{\delta} = 0,
$$

and

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} (r _ {t} (h) + \log \tilde {\delta}) h = - \frac {t}{1 - \phi} \log \beta + m c _ {t} ^ {T}.
$$

which confirms the definition of transitory components of the SDF, i.e.,

$$
m c _ {t} ^ {T} = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \log \tilde {\delta} (t + h) - \log p _ {t} (h).
$$

Recall that

$$
\begin{array}{l} m c _ {t} ^ {T} = \frac {\overline {{m c}} ^ {T}}{1 - \phi} - \frac {\phi}{1 - \phi} \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi} + \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi} t - \gamma \log y _ {t} ^ {T} \\ = \frac {\overline {{m c}} ^ {T}}{1 - \phi} - \frac {\phi}{1 - \phi} \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi} + \frac {\log \beta}{1 - \phi} t + \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\infty} \phi^ {i} \sigma_ {T} \varepsilon_ {t - i} ^ {T} \\ \end{array}
$$

plugging  $mc_{t}^{T}$  into the bond return immediately yields Eq. (3.19).

# A.12 Proposition 3.11 in Section 3.D.

Proof. The one-period risk free rate is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (- r _ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t, t + 1} ] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m c _ {t + 1} ^ {P} - m c _ {t} ^ {P} + m c _ {t + 1} ^ {T} - m c _ {t} ^ {T}) ] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(- \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {P} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {P} + \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + (\phi - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} + (t + 1) \log \beta + \sigma_ {T} \varepsilon_ {t + 1} ^ {T}\right) \right] \\ = \exp \left(\overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + (\phi - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} + (t + 1) \log \beta + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {T P}\right), \\ - r _ {t} = \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + (\phi - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} + (t + 1) \log \beta + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {T P}. \\ \end{array}
$$

For long-term bond, the risk premium is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \log p _ {t - 1} (h - 1) - \log p _ {t} (h) - r _ {t} \right] \\ = - \phi^ {h - 1} \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + \left(\frac {(t + 1) \phi^ {h} - (t + 2) \phi^ {h - 1}}{1 - \phi} + \frac {\phi^ {h - 1}}{1 - \phi}\right) \log \beta \\ + (\phi^ {h - 1} - 1) \left(\overline {{m c ^ {T}}} + \phi m c _ {t} ^ {T} + (t + 1) \log \beta\right) - (\phi^ {h} - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} - \frac {1}{2} \phi^ {2 (h - 1)} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} - \phi^ {h - 1} \sigma_ {T P} \\ + \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + (\phi - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} + (t + 1) \log \beta + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {T P} \\ = \left(\frac {1}{2} - \frac {1}{2} \phi^ {2 (h - 1)}\right) \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + (1 - \phi^ {h - 1}) \sigma_ {T P} \\ \end{array}
$$

Taking  $h \to \infty$  yields

$$
\lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \log p _ {t - 1} (h - 1) - \log p _ {t} (h) - r _ {t} ] = \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {T P}.
$$

The price of gdp claim at time  $t$  is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} p _ {t} ^ {y} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (m _ {t, t + h} + \log y _ {t + h}) ] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m c _ {t + h} ^ {P} - m c _ {t} ^ {P} + m c _ {t + h} ^ {T} - m c _ {t} ^ {T} + \log y _ {t + h}\right) \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} \left(- \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {P} \varepsilon_ {t + k} ^ {P}\right) \right. \right. \\ + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} \phi^ {h - k} \bar {m c} ^ {T} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} \phi^ {h - k} (t + k) \log \beta + (\phi^ {h} - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} \left(\phi^ {h - k} \sigma_ {T} \varepsilon_ {t + k} ^ {T}\right) \\ \left. \left. + \log y _ {t} ^ {P} + h \mu + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} v _ {P} \varepsilon_ {t + k} ^ {P} + \phi^ {h} \log y _ {t} ^ {T} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {h} \phi^ {h - k} v _ {T} \varepsilon_ {t + k} ^ {T}\right) \right] \\ = \exp \left(\frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + \left(\frac {t + h - (t + 1) \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} - \frac {\phi - \phi^ {h}}{(1 - \phi) ^ {2}}\right) \log \beta + (\phi^ {h} - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} \right. \\ + \log y _ {t} ^ {P} + h \mu + \phi^ {h} \log y _ {t} ^ {T} + \frac {1 - 2 \gamma}{2 \gamma^ {2}} h \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \frac {1 - \phi^ {2 h}}{2 (1 - \phi^ {2})} \left(\frac {\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \frac {1 - \phi^ {h}}{1 - \phi} \left(\frac {\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {T P}), \\ \end{array}
$$

where we plugged in  $\nu_{P} = -(1 / \gamma)\sigma_{P},\nu_{T} = -(1 / \gamma)\sigma_{T}$  . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \log p _ {t + 1} ^ {y} (h - 1) - \log p _ {t} ^ {y} (h) - r _ {t} ] \\ = - \phi^ {h - 1} \overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + \left(\frac {(t + 1) \phi^ {h} - (t + 2) \phi^ {h - 1}}{1 - \phi} + \frac {\phi^ {h - 1}}{1 - \phi}\right) \log \beta + (\phi^ {h - 1} - 1) (\overline {{m c}} ^ {T} + \phi m c _ {t} ^ {T} + (t + 1) \beta) - (\phi^ {h} - 1) m c _ {t} ^ {T} \\ - \frac {1 - 2 \gamma}{2 \gamma^ {2}} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} - \frac {\phi^ {2 (h - 1)}}{2} \left(\frac {\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} - \phi^ {h - 1} \left(\frac {\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {T P} - r _ {t} \\ = \frac {2 \gamma - 1}{2 \gamma^ {2}} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \left[ \frac {1}{2} - \frac {\phi^ {2 (h - 1)}}{2} \left(\frac {\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\right) ^ {2} \right] \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \left[ 1 - \phi^ {h - 1} \left(\frac {\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\right) ^ {2} \right] \sigma_ {T P}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Taking  $h\to \infty$  yields

$$
\lim _ {h \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \log p _ {t + 1} ^ {y} (h - 1) - \log p _ {t} ^ {y} (h) - r _ {t} ] = \frac {2 \gamma - 1}{2 \gamma^ {2}} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {T} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {T P}.

# A.13 Proposition 4.3 in Section 4.B

Proof. Recall the within-in period solutions

$$
p _ {t} = \alpha \frac {c _ {t}}{c _ {H , t}}, \qquad p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) = (1 - \alpha) \frac {c _ {t}}{c _ {F , t}}

which combined characterize the exchange rate as

\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {L} = \pi \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(u (c _ {t}) + v (b _ {H, t}; \theta_ {t})\right) \right] + (1 - \pi) \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} \left(u (c _ {t} ^ {*}) + v (b _ {H, t} ^ {*}; \theta_ {t} ^ {*})\right) \right] \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {H, t} (y _ {t} - c _ {H, t} - c _ {H, t} ^ {*}) + \zeta_ {F, t} (y _ {t} ^ {*} - c _ {F, t} - c _ {F, t} ^ {*}) \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \xi_ {H, t} (\bar {b} _ {t} - b _ {H, t} - b _ {H, t} ^ {*}) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

The first order conditions w.r.t. 6 endogenous variables are

$$
\text {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t}: \quad \pi \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) \alpha \frac {c _ {t}}{c _ {H , t}} = \zeta_ {H, t}
$$

$$
\mathrm {w . r . t .} c _ {H, t} ^ {*}: (1 - \pi) \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) (1 - \alpha) \frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}} = \zeta_ {H, t}
$$

$$
\mathrm {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t}: \quad \pi \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) (1 - \alpha) \frac {c _ {t}}{c _ {F , t}} = \zeta_ {F, t}
$$

$$
\mathrm {w . r . t .} c _ {F, t} ^ {*}: (1 - \pi) \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*}) \alpha \frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}} = \zeta_ {F, t}
$$

$$
w. r. t. b _ {H, t}: \quad \pi \delta^ {t} v ^ {\prime} (b _ {H, t}; \theta_ {t}) = \xi_ {H, t}
$$

$$
w. r. t. b _ {H, t} ^ {*} \colon (1 - \pi) \delta^ {t} v ^ {\prime} \left(b _ {H, t} ^ {*}; \theta_ {t} ^ {*}\right) = \xi_ {H, t}
$$

with 3 resource constraint conditions, we can solve the 6 endogenous variables and the 3 lagrangian multipliers. Divide the first foc condition by the second one and plug in the within-period solution to obtain the exchange rate as follows

$$
\exp (e _ {t}) = \frac {\pi u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)}{\left(1 - \pi\right) u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right)}.
$$

which implies

$$
\Delta e _ {t} = m _ {t} - m _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

Besides, we are typically interested in the convenience yields, which are given by Eq. (4.2) and (4.3), i.e.,

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {t}) = 1 - \frac {v ^ {\prime} (b _ {H , t} ; \theta_ {t})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})} = 1 - \frac {\xi_ {H , t}}{\pi \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (- \lambda_ {t} ^ {*}) = 1 - \frac {v ^ {\prime} (b _ {H , t} ^ {*} ; \theta_ {t} ^ {*})}{u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})} \exp (- e _ {t}) \\ = 1 - \frac {\xi_ {H , t}}{(1 - \pi) \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right)} \exp \left(- e _ {t}\right) \\ = 1 - \frac {\xi_ {H , t}}{(1 - \pi) \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})} \frac {(1 - \pi) u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t} ^ {*})}{\pi u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})} \\ = 1 - \frac {\xi_ {H , t}}{\pi \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Hence,  $\lambda_{t} = \lambda_{t}^{*}$ . Finally, the last two first-order conditions imply  $\pi v^{\prime}(b_{H,t};\theta_t) = (1 - \pi)v^{\prime}(b_{H,t}^{*};\theta_{t}^{*})$ . This concludes the proof.

# A.14 Lemma 5.1 in Section 5.A

Proof. (1) The first-order condition for the home household's portfolio choice problem (5.2) is:

$$
\exp (- \delta t) \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{c _ {t}} = \zeta_ {H} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}), \tag {A.7}
$$

where the Lagrange multiplier  $\zeta_H$  is such that the budget constraint evaluated at the optimal consumption expenditure,  $c_{t}$ , is satisfied with equality:

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}\right) \left(c _ {t} - p _ {t} y _ {t}\right) d t \right] = w _ {0}.
$$

The home country SDF based on home household's consumption is then

$$
\exp (- \delta t) \frac {\gamma_ {t} c _ {0}}{\gamma_ {0} c _ {t}} = \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t} - m _ {\nu_ {H}, 0}) = \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}).
$$

(2) Let  $\lambda_t^*$  denote the market price of risk from the viewpoint of a foreign consumer in the foreign numétaire:

$$
\lambda_ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}} \left[ r _ {t} + \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t} ^ {*} \right]
$$

Then, the set of foreign country SDFs can be represented as:

$$
d \exp (m _ {\nu^ {*}, t} ^ {*}) = - r _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (m _ {\nu^ {*}, t} ^ {*}) d t - \left(\lambda_ {t} ^ {*} + \nu_ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {T} \exp (m _ {\nu^ {*}, t} ^ {*}) d Z _ {t},
$$

with  $\nu^{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$  satisfying  $\sigma_{t}\nu_{t}^{*} = 0$  for all  $t \in [0,T]$  and  $\int_0^T\| \nu_t^*\|^2 dt < \infty$ .

Then, we can write foreign household's static variational portfolio choice problem in their local numétaire:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \max  _ {c _ {t} ^ {*}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) \gamma^ {*} \log c _ {t} ^ {*} d t \right] \\ \text {s . t .} \quad \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp \left(m _ {\nu^ {*}, t} ^ {*}\right) \left(c _ {t} ^ {*} - p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*}\right) d t \right] \leq w _ {0} ^ {*}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The first-order condition for the foreign household's portfolio choice problem is:

$$
\exp (- \delta t) \frac {\gamma^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}} = \zeta_ {F} \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*}\right), \tag {A.8}
$$

where  $\exp(m_{\nu_F^*,t}^*)$  denotes the foreign country state price density that bounds all the budget constraints, and the Lagrangian multiplier  $\zeta_F$  is such that the budget constraint evaluated at the optimal consumption expenditure  $c_t^*$  is satisfied with equality

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*}\right) \left(c _ {t} ^ {*} - p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*}\right) d t \right] = w _ {0} ^ {*}.
$$

Then, the foreign country SDF based on foreign household's consumption is:

$$
\exp (- \delta t) \frac {c _ {0} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}} = \exp (m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*} - m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, 0} ^ {*}) = \exp (m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*}).
$$

# A.15 Proposition 5.1 in Section 5.A

Proof. (1) By no arbitrage, home household's wealth in the home numérique at time  $t$  is:

$$
w _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , u})}{\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})} \left(c _ {u} - p _ {u} y _ {u}\right) d u \right].
$$

Define

$$
s _ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , u})}{\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})} p _ {u} y _ {u} d u \right].
$$

Assume the law of motion of  $s_t$  is given by

$$
d s _ {t} = \mu_ {t} ^ {s} s _ {t} d t + \sigma_ {t} ^ {s} s _ {t} d Z _ {t}
$$

Making use of (A.7) in Lemma 5.1, we have

$$
w _ {t} + s _ {t} = \frac {1}{\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) \frac {\gamma_ {u}}{\zeta_ {H}} d u \right] = \frac {\exp (- \delta t) - \exp (- \delta T)}{\delta} \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{\zeta_ {H} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})}.
$$

Note that  $w_{t}$  can be interpreted as the "bond wealth" and the total wealth is  $w_{t}$  plus the value of future endowment flow, which together finance the future consumption. To find the optimal portfolios, we apply Ito's Lemma to (A.9).

$$
\begin{array}{l} d \left(w _ {t} + s _ {t}\right) = d \left[ \frac {\exp (- \delta t) - \exp (- \delta T)}{\delta} \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{\zeta_ {H} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})} \right] \\ = (w _ {t} + s _ {t}) \left[ - \frac {\delta}{1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))} + r _ {t} + (\lambda_ {t} + \nu_ {H, t}) ^ {\prime} (\lambda_ {t} + \nu_ {H, t}) + \frac {\gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3}}{\gamma_ {t}} (\lambda_ {t} + \nu_ {H, t}) \right] d t \\ + \left(w _ {t} + s _ {t}\right) \left[ \frac {\gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3}}{\gamma_ {t}} + \left(\lambda_ {t} + \nu_ {H, t}\right) ^ {\prime} \right] d Z _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Matching the diffusion term with that in the dynamic budget constraint yields:

$$
- x _ {t} w _ {t} \sigma_ {t} = \left(w _ {t} + s _ {t}\right) \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3}}{\gamma_ {t}} + \left(\lambda_ {t} + \nu_ {H , t}\right) ^ {\prime}\right) - s _ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {s}. \tag {A.10}
$$

Notice that in incomplete markets, the matrix  $\sigma_t^\prime \sigma_t$  is not a full-rank square matrix, and the above system of equations contains three equations in one unknown. It has a solution if and only if its right-hand side lies in the  $\operatorname{Span}(\sigma_t)$ . This implies a restriction:

$$
\left(I _ {3} - \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {t}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}\right) \frac {\gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} ^ {\prime}}{\gamma_ {t}} + \nu_ {H, t} - \frac {s _ {t}}{w _ {t} + s _ {t}} \left(I _ {3} - \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {t}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}\right) (\sigma_ {t} ^ {s}) ^ {\prime} = 0,
$$

where we apply operator  $\left(I_3 - \frac{\sigma_t^\prime\sigma_t}{\|\sigma_t\|^2}\right)$  to both sides of (A.10). Rearranging the terms, we have:

$$
\nu_ {H, t} = \left(I _ {3} - \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {t}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}\right) \left(- \omega i _ {3} ^ {\prime} + \frac {s _ {t}}{w _ {t} + s _ {t}} (\sigma_ {t} ^ {s}) ^ {\prime}\right). \tag {A.11}
$$

To obtain the optimal portfolio of the home country household, we apply the operator  $-\frac{\sigma_t'}{|\sigma_t|^2}$  to both sides of (A.10).

$$
\begin{array}{l} x _ {t} = - \frac {w _ {t} + s _ {t}}{w _ {t}} \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3}}{\gamma_ {t}} + (\lambda_ {t} + \nu_ {H, t}) ^ {\prime}\right) \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}} + \frac {s _ {t}}{w _ {t}} \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {s} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}} \\ = - \frac {w _ {t} + s _ {t}}{w _ {t}} \left(\frac {\omega \sigma_ {3 , t}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}} - \frac {(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t})}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}\right) + \frac {s _ {t}}{w _ {t}} \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {s} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}. \\ \end{array}
$$

For the foreign households, the first-order condition for the foreign household's static variational portfolio choice problem in the home numérique is:

$$
\exp (- \delta t) \frac {\gamma^ {*}}{\tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*}} = \tilde {\zeta} _ {F} \exp (m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F}, t}), \tag {A.12}
$$

where  $\exp(m_{\tilde{\nu}_F,t})$  denotes an appropriate home country state price density that bounds all the budget constraints of the foreign household, and  $\tilde{\zeta}_F$  is the Lagrange multiplier such that the budget constraint evaluated at the optimal consumption expenditure,  $\tilde{c}_t^*$ , is satisfied with equality:

$$
E \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp \left(m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F}, t}\right) \left(\tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*} - p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}\right) d t \right] = \tilde {w} _ {0} ^ {*}.
$$

By no arbitrage, foreign household's wealth in the home numéraires at time  $t$  is:

$$
\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} = E _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {\exp (m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F} , u})}{\exp (m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F} , t})} (\tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*} - p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}) d u \right].
$$

Similarly, denote

$$
\tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = E _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {\exp (m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F} , u})}{\exp (m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F} , t})} p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*} d u \right].
$$

Assume the law of motion of  $\tilde{s}_t^*$  is given by

$$
d \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \mu_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}} \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} d t + \sigma_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}} \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} d Z _ {t}
$$

Making use of (A.12), we have

$$
\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \bar {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1}{\exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) \frac {\gamma^ {*}}{\tilde {\zeta} _ {F}} d u \right] = \frac {\exp (- \delta t) - \exp (- \delta T)}{\delta} \frac {\gamma^ {*}}{\tilde {\zeta} _ {F} \exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})}.
$$

To find the optimal portfolios, we apply Ito's Lemma to (A.13),

$$
d (\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}) = (\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}) \left[ - \frac {\delta}{1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))} + r _ {t} + (\lambda_ {t} + \tilde {v} _ {F, t}) ^ {\prime} (\lambda_ {t} + \tilde {v} _ {F, t}) \right] d t + (\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}) (\lambda_ {t} + \tilde {v} _ {F, t}) ^ {\prime} d Z _ {t}.
$$

Matching the diffusion term with that in the dynamic budget constraint yields

$$
\left(x _ {t} ^ {*} - 1\right) \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} \sigma_ {t} = \left(\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \left(\lambda_ {t} + \tilde {v} _ {F, t}\right) ^ {\prime} - \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}} \tag {A.14}
$$

In incomplete markets, the matrix  $\sigma_t^\prime \sigma_t$  has a solution if and only if its right hand side lies in  $\operatorname{Span}(\sigma_t)$ . This entails a restriction:

$$
\tilde {v} _ {F, t} = \frac {\tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}} \left(I _ {3} - \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {t}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}\right) \left(\sigma_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {\prime}, \tag {A.15}
$$

where we apply operator  $\left(I_3 - \frac{\sigma_t'\sigma_t}{\|\sigma_t\|^2}\right)$  to both sides of (A.14).

To get the optimal portfolio choice for the foreign household, we apply the operator  $\frac{\sigma_t'}{\|\sigma_t\|^2}$  from right to both sides of (A.14).

$$
\begin{array}{l} x _ {t} ^ {*} - 1 = \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*}} [ (\lambda_ {t} + \tilde {v} _ {F, t}) ^ {\prime} ] \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}} - \frac {\tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}} \\ x _ {t} ^ {*} = 1 - \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\left(r _ {t} ^ {*} - \kappa_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} - r _ {t}\right)}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}} - \frac {\tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\sigma_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime}}{\| \sigma_ {t} \| ^ {2}}. \\ \end{array}
$$

# A.16 Lemma 5.2 in Section 5.A

Proof. The representative agent's utility evaluated at the aggregate output is given by

$$
U (y _ {t}, y _ {t} ^ {*}; \pi_ {t}) = \max  _ {c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}, c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta t) (u (c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}) + \pi_ {t} u ^ {*} (c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*})) d t \right]
$$

s.t.  $c_{H,t} + c_{H,t}^{*} = y_{t},$

$$
c _ {F, t} + c _ {F, t} ^ {*} = y _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

Then, the marginal utilities of the representative agent and the individual agents evaluated at the optimum are related as

$$
\nabla U \left(y _ {t}, y _ {t} ^ {*}; \pi_ {t}\right) = \nabla u \left(c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}\right) = \pi_ {t} \nabla u ^ {*} \left(c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}\right).
$$

From the first-order conditions of the home and foreign households, we have

$$
\nabla u \left(c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}\right) = \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha}{c _ {H , t}}, \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha)}{c _ {F , t}}\right),
$$

$$
\nabla u ^ {*} (c _ {H, t} ^ {*}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}) = \left(\frac {\gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}}, \frac {\gamma^ {*} \alpha}{c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}\right).
$$

Besides, by our previous results:

$$
c _ {H, t} = \frac {\alpha}{p _ {t}} c _ {t}, \quad c _ {F, t} = \frac {(1 - \alpha)}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})} c _ {t}, \quad \exp (- \delta t) \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{c _ {t}} = \zeta_ {H} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}),
$$

we have

$$
\nabla u \left(c _ {H, t}, c _ {F, t}\right) = \left(\exp (\delta t) \zeta_ {H} \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}\right) p _ {t}, \exp (\delta t) \zeta_ {H} \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}\right) p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})\right).
$$

Similarly, for the foreign household,

$$
\nabla u ^ {*} \left(c _ {F, t}, c _ {F, t} ^ {*}\right) = \left(\exp (\delta t) \tilde {\zeta} _ {F} \exp \left(m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F}, t}\right) p _ {t}, \exp (\delta t) \tilde {\zeta} _ {F} \exp \left(m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F}, t}\right) p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})\right).
$$

We substitute the solutions of  $c_{H,t}, c_{F,t}, c_{H,t}^{*}, c_{F,t}^{*}$  into the above gradients of  $\nabla u\left(c_{H,t}, c_{H,t}^{*}\right)$  to get the state price density that bound all the budget constraints of the home consumers.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}) = \frac {\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})}{\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , 0})} = \exp (- \delta t) \frac {\gamma_ {t} c _ {0}}{\gamma_ {0} c _ {t}} = \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0} c _ {H , 0} \gamma_ {t}}{p _ {t} c _ {H , t} \gamma_ {0}} \\ = \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0} y _ {0}}{p _ {t} y _ {t}} \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {0} \alpha + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \tag {A.16} \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore, by the expression of the state-price-density in A.16, the price of the home stock in the home numétaire is

$$
\begin{array}{l} s _ {t} = \frac {1}{\exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {H} , t}\right)} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {H}, u}\right) p _ {u} y _ {u} d u \right] \tag {A.17} \\ = \frac {\exp (\delta t) p _ {t} y _ {t}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) \left(\gamma_ {u} \alpha + \pi_ {u} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)\right) d u \right] \\ = \frac {\exp (\delta t) p _ {t} y _ {t}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \left[ \frac {1}{\delta} \left(\exp (- \delta t) - \exp (- \delta T)\right) \gamma_ {t} \alpha + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) \pi_ {u} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) d u \right] \right] \\ = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} y _ {t} + \frac {\exp (\delta t) p _ {t} y _ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) (\pi_ {u} - \pi_ {t}) d u \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

where we used the fact that  $\gamma_{t}$  is a martingale.

Similarly, we can then derive the home country state price density that bounds all the budget constraints of the foreign consumers as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F}, t}) = \frac {\exp (m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F} , t})}{\exp (m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F} , 0})} = \exp (- \delta t) \frac {\tilde {c} _ {0} ^ {*}}{\tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*}} = \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {0}) c _ {F , 0} ^ {*}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) c _ {F , t} ^ {*}} \\ = \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {0}) y _ {0} ^ {*}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\pi_ {0}}{\pi_ {t}} \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}. \tag {A.18} \\ \end{array}
$$

Analogously, plugging in the expression of the state-price-density in (A.18), we find the price of the foreign stock in the home numérique to be

$$
\begin{array}{l} \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1}{\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, u}) p _ {u} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {u}) y _ {u} ^ {*} d u \right] \tag {A.19} \\ = \frac {\exp (\delta t) p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) \left(\gamma_ {u} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {u} \gamma^ {*} \alpha\right) d u \right] \\ = \frac {\exp (\delta t) p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \left[ \frac {1}{\delta} \left(\exp (- \delta t) - \exp (- \delta T)\right) \gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) \pi_ {u} \gamma^ {*} \alpha d u \right] \right] \\ = \exp (- e _ {t}) \left[ \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} + \frac {\exp (\delta t) p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) (\pi_ {u} - \pi_ {t}) d u \right] \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore, the foreign stock price in the foreign numétaire is:

$$
s _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} + \frac {\exp (\delta t) p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) \left(\pi_ {u} - \pi_ {t}\right) d u \right]. \tag {A.20}
$$

There are two ways to proceed in evaluating the above conditional expectations. The first is to assume that  $\pi$  is a martingale and then verify that it is indeed the case in equilibrium. However, lowe can only prove that it is a local martingale. In special cases, we can impose some other regularity conditions on the preference shifts to guarantee that  $\pi_t$  is a martingale but, in general, it is not an immediate result. An alternative approach is to use the following, less direct, argument based on market clearing. Plug the first-order conditions

$$
\exp (- \delta t) \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{c _ {t}} = \zeta_ {H} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}),
$$

$$
\exp (- \delta t) \frac {\gamma^ {*}}{\tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*}} = \tilde {\zeta} _ {F} \exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F}, t}),
$$

into (A.9) and (A.13), we have

$$
w _ {t} + s _ {t} = \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{\zeta_ {H} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})} \frac {\exp (- \delta t) - \exp (- \delta T)}{\delta} = \frac {\exp (- \delta t) - \exp (- \delta T)}{\delta} \exp (\delta t) c _ {t} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} c _ {t},
$$

$$
\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {\gamma^ {*}}{\tilde {\zeta} _ {F} \exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})} \frac {\exp (- \delta t) - \exp (- \delta T)}{\delta} = \frac {\exp (- \delta t) - \exp (- \delta T)}{\delta} \exp (\delta t) \tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

Therefore, we have

$$
w _ {t} + s _ {t} + \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \left(c _ {t} + \tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*}\right) = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \left(p _ {t} y _ {t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})\right),
$$

where we use the fact that the home and foreign households' total consumption expenditure at time  $t$  equals the value of their endowments. On the other hand, from the resource constraint,

$$
w _ {t} + s _ {t} + \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = s _ {t} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

Combining the resulting restriction,

$$
s _ {t} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \left(p _ {t} y _ {t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})\right),
$$

with (A.17) and (A.19), we have

$$
\left[ \frac {\exp (\delta t) p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} + \frac {\exp (\delta t) p _ {t} y _ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \right] \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) (\pi_ {u} - \pi_ {t}) d u \right] = 0,
$$

Since the coefficient term  $\left[\frac{\exp(\delta t)p_t^*y_t^*\gamma^*\alpha}{\gamma_t(1 - \alpha) + \pi_t\gamma^*\alpha} +\frac{\exp(\delta t)p_ty_t\gamma^*(1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_t\alpha + \pi_t\gamma^*(1 - \alpha)}\right]$  is non-zero for each  $t$ , it has to be

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \exp (- \delta u) \left(\pi_ {u} - \pi_ {t}\right) d u \right] = 0 \tag {A.21}
$$

Then, we can conclude that the home stock price in the home numéraire is:

$$
s _ {t} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} y _ {t},
$$

and the price of the foreign stock in the foreign numétaire is:

$$
s _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

Therefore, the price of the foreign stock prices in the home numéraire

is:

$$
\tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \exp (- e _ {t}) \left[ \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} \right].
$$

By the previous results for good prices and the exchange rate,

$$
p _ {t} = \alpha \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}, p _ {t} ^ {*} = \alpha \left(\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {\alpha - 1}, \exp (e _ {t}) = \exp (t o t _ {t}) ^ {2 \alpha - 1},
$$

we have

$$
s _ {t} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \alpha \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} y _ {t}, \tag {A.22}
$$

$$
s _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \alpha \left(\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {\alpha - 1} y _ {t} ^ {*},
$$

$$
\tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (\delta (T - t))}{\delta} \alpha \left(\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha}\right) ^ {\alpha - 1} \exp (t o t _ {t}) ^ {- \alpha} y _ {t} ^ {*}, \tag {A.23}
$$

and hence

$$
s _ {t} ^ {*} = s _ {t} \exp (- t o t _ {t}) \frac {y _ {t} ^ {*}}{y _ {t}}.
$$

We then calculate the wealth processes.

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {t} + s _ {t} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} c _ {t} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \left(p _ {t} c _ {H, t} + p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) c _ {F, t}\right) \\ = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} p _ {t} y _ {t} + \exp (- e _ {t}) \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \\ = \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} s _ {t} + \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \tilde {c} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \left(\exp (- e _ {t}) p _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {F, t} ^ {*} + p _ {t} c _ {H, t} ^ {*}\right) \\ = \frac {1 - \exp (- \delta (T - t))}{\delta} \left(\frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} p _ {t} ^ {*} y _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) + \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} p _ {t} y _ {t}\right) \\ = \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} s _ {t} + \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ \end{array}
$$

which lead to

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {t} + s _ {t} = \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} s _ {t} + \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t}) ^ {- 1} \frac {y _ {t} ^ {*}}{y _ {t}} s _ {t}, \\ w _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \exp (t o t _ {t}) \frac {y _ {t}}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} s _ {t} ^ {*} + \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} s _ {t} ^ {*}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Plugging the expression of terms of trade  $\exp (tot_{t})$

$$
\exp (t o t _ {t}) = \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \frac {y _ {t} ^ {*}}{y _ {t}},
$$

into the expression of home and foreign wealth in local numéraires, we have

$$
w _ {t} + s _ {t} = \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} s _ {t},
$$

$$
w _ {t} ^ {*} + s _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {\pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} s _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

# A.17 Proposition 5.2 in Section 5.A

Proof. (1) By substituting (A.9) and (A.13) into (5.7), we have

$$
\pi_ {t} = \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {*} + \tilde {s} _ {t} ^ {*}}{w _ {t} + s _ {t}} \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{\gamma^ {*}} = \frac {\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})}{\exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})} \frac {\zeta_ {H}}{\tilde {\zeta} _ {F}}
$$

Recall the representation of both countries' home state price densities,

$$
d \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}\right) = - r _ {t} \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}\right) d t - \left(\lambda_ {t} + \nu_ {H, t}\right) ^ {\prime} \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}\right) d Z _ {t} \tag {A.24}
$$

$$
d \exp \left(m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F}, t}\right) = - r _ {t} \exp \left(m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F}, t}\right) d t - \left(\lambda_ {t} + \tilde {v} _ {F, t}\right) ^ {\prime} \exp \left(m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F}, t}\right) d Z _ {t}. \tag {A.25}
$$

Then, we apply Ito's Lemma to  $\pi_t$  and obtain:

$$
\begin{array}{l} d \pi_ {t} = \pi_ {t} \frac {d \exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {H} , t})}{\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})} - \pi_ {t} \frac {d \exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})}{\exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})} - \pi_ {t} \left[ \frac {d \exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})}{\exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})}, \frac {d \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})}{\exp (m _ {\nu_ {H} , t})} \right] + \pi_ {t} \left[ \frac {d \exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})}{\exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})}, \frac {d \exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})}{\exp (m _ {\tilde {\nu} _ {F} , t})} \right] \\ = \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} - \nu_ {H, t}) ^ {\prime} \tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} d t + \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} - \nu_ {H, t}) ^ {\prime} d Z _ {t}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where we use the definition of  $\lambda_{t}$  and the restriction that  $\sigma_t\nu_{H,t} = 0$ ,  $\sigma_t\nu_{H,t} = 0$ . Eq. (A.21) holds for every  $t$ , which implies  $(\tilde{\nu}_{F,t} - \nu_{H,t})'\tilde{\nu}_{F,t} = 0$ .

If we further suppose that at both countries' households do not hold any bonds at the beginning, which means  $w_0 = s_0$  and  $w_0^* = s_0^*$ , we can derive the following results:

$$
\frac {\gamma_ {0}}{\gamma_ {0} \alpha + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} = 1 \Leftrightarrow \gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha) = \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)
$$

$$
\frac {\pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*}}{\gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} = 1 \Leftrightarrow \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) = \gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha).
$$

which both lead to

$$
\pi_ {0} = \frac {\gamma_ {0}}{\gamma^ {*}}.
$$

(2) Define

$$
i _ {1} \stackrel {{\mathrm {d e f}}} {{=}} (1, 0, 0), \quad i _ {2} \stackrel {{\mathrm {d e f}}} {{=}} (0, 1, 0), \quad i _ {3} \stackrel {{\mathrm {d e f}}} {{=}} (0, 0, 1).
$$

Apply Ito's Lemma to  $\exp (tot_{t})$ , we obtain:

$$
\begin{array}{l} d \exp (t o t _ {t}) = d \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \frac {y _ {t} ^ {*}}{y _ {t}}\right) \\ = \exp (t o t _ {t}) \left[ \frac {1}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} d y _ {t} ^ {*} - \frac {1}{y _ {t}} d y _ {t} - \frac {1}{y _ {t} y _ {t} ^ {*}} [ d y _ {t}, d y _ {t} ^ {*} ] + \frac {1}{y _ {t} ^ {2}} [ d y _ {t}, d y _ {t} ] \right. \\ + \frac {1}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} (\alpha d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) d \pi_ {t}) - \frac {1}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} ((1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha d \pi_ {t}) \\ + \frac {1}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\left[ d y _ {t} ^ {*} , \alpha d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) d \pi_ {t} \right]}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} - \frac {1}{y _ {t}} \frac {\left[ d y _ {t} , \alpha d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) d \pi_ {t} \right]}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \\ - \frac {1}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\left[ d y _ {t} ^ {*} , (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha d \pi_ {t} \right]}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} + \frac {1}{y _ {t}} \frac {\left[ d y _ {t} , (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha d \pi_ {t} \right]}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \\ + \frac {[ (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha d \pi_ {t} , (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha d \pi_ {t} ]}{(\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha) ^ {2}} - \frac {[ \alpha d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) d \pi_ {t} , (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha d \pi_ {t} ]}{[ \gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) ] [ \gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha ]} \\ \end{array}
$$

Recall that  $e_t = (2\alpha - 1)tot_t$ , which implies

$$
d (t o t _ {t}) = \frac {1}{2 \alpha - 1} \kappa_ {t} d t + \frac {1}{2 \alpha - 1} \sigma_ {t} d Z _ {t}.
$$

If an equilibrium as in (1) exists, by matching the drift and diffusion terms for  $\exp (tot_{t})$ ,

$$
d \exp (t o t _ {t}) = \exp (t o t _ {t}) (\frac {\kappa_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} + \frac {1}{2} | | \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} | | ^ {2}) d t + \exp (t o t _ {t}) \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} d Z _ {t},
$$

we can compute  $\kappa_{t}$  and  $\sigma_{t}$  as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} = - \sigma_ {y} i _ {1} + \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} i _ {2} + \frac {\alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \\ \frac {\kappa_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} = \mu_ {y ^ {*}} - \mu_ {y} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \frac {\| \alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime} \| ^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)) ^ {2}} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\| (1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \gamma^ {*} \alpha \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime} \| ^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha) ^ {2}}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Plug in Eq. (A.22) and (A.23) to obtain the drift and volatility of stock price dynamics

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mu_ {t} ^ {\mathrm {s}} = (1 - \alpha) \frac {\kappa_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} + \frac {(\alpha - 1) ^ {2}}{2} \| \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} \| ^ {2} + \mu_ {y} + (1 - \alpha) \sigma_ {y} \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} i _ {1} ^ {\prime}, \\ \sigma_ {t} ^ {s} = (1 - \alpha) \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} + \sigma_ {y} i _ {1}, \\ \mu_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}} = - \alpha \frac {\kappa_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} + \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{2} \| \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} \| ^ {2} + \mu_ {y ^ {*}} - \alpha \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} i _ {2} ^ {\prime}, \\ \sigma_ {t} ^ {\tilde {s} ^ {*}} = - \alpha \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} + \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} i _ {2}, \\ \end{array}
$$

Combined with Eq. (A.11) and (A.15), we can solve  $\kappa_{t},\sigma_{t},\nu_{H,t},\tilde{\nu}_{F,t}$  simultaneously as function of exogenous state variables.

(3) Given the formula of the home numétaire, we have

$$
\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} = p _ {t} ^ {\alpha} \left[ p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) \right] ^ {1 - \alpha}.
$$

Therefore, the home household's consumption-based home country stochastic price density is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}) = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} p _ {t} ^ {\alpha} [ p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) ] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}) \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} p _ {t} ^ {\alpha} [ p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) ] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0}}{p _ {t}} \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {0} \alpha + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \frac {y _ {0}}{y _ {t}} \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} \left[ \frac {p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})}{p _ {t}} \right] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp (- \delta t) \left[ \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {0} \alpha + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \right] \left[ \frac {y _ {0}}{y _ {t}} \right] p _ {0} \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} \exp ((\alpha - 1) t o t _ {t} - \delta t) \left[ \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {0} \alpha + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \right] \left[ \frac {y _ {0}}{y _ {t}} \right] p _ {0}. \\ \end{array}
$$

It follows that

$$
d \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}) = \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}) \left(\mu_ {m, t} + \frac {1}{2} \| \sigma_ {m, t} \| ^ {2}\right) d t + \exp (m _ {\nu_ {H}, t}) \sigma_ {m, t} d Z _ {t},
$$

where

$$
\mu_ {m, t} = - \delta + (\alpha - 1) \frac {\kappa_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} - \mu_ {y} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \frac {\left| \left| \alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + (1 - \alpha) \gamma^ {*} \pi_ {t} \left(\tilde {v} _ {F , t} - v _ {H , t}\right) ^ {\prime} \right| \right| ^ {2}}{\left(\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)\right) ^ {2}},
$$

$$
\sigma_ {m, t} = (\alpha - 1) \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} - \sigma_ {y} i _ {1} + \frac {\alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + (1 - \alpha) \gamma^ {*} \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}.
$$

Similarly, for the foreign numétaire, we have

$$
\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} = p _ {t} ^ {* \alpha} [ p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t}) ] ^ {1 - \alpha}.
$$

Then, the foreign household's consumption-based foreign country stochastic price density is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*}) = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} p _ {t} ^ {* \alpha} [ p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t}) ] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp (m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*}) \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} p _ {t} ^ {* \alpha} [ p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t}) ] ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {\exp (e _ {0})}{\exp (e _ {t})} \exp (m _ {\tilde {v} _ {F}, t}) \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} p _ {t} ^ {* \alpha} [ p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t}) ] ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {\exp (e _ {0})}{\exp (e _ {t})} \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {0}) y _ {0} ^ {*}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t}) y _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\pi_ {0}}{\pi_ {t}} \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} \left[ \frac {p _ {t} \exp (e _ {t})}{p _ {t} ^ {*}} \right] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0} ^ {*} y _ {0} ^ {*}}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\pi_ {0}}{\pi_ {t}} \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} \exp \big ((1 - \alpha) t o t _ {t} - \delta t \big) \left[ \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {0} \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \right] \left[ \frac {y _ {0} ^ {*} \pi_ {0}}{y _ {t} ^ {*} \pi_ {t}} \right] p _ {0} ^ {*}. \\ \end{array}
$$

It follows that

$$
d \exp (m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*}) = \exp (m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*}) \left(\mu_ {m ^ {*}, t} + \frac {1}{2} \| \sigma_ {m ^ {*}, t} \| ^ {2}\right) d t + \exp (m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*}) \sigma_ {m ^ {*}, t} d Z _ {t}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mu_ {m ^ {*}, t} = - \delta + (1 - \alpha) \frac {\kappa_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} - \mu_ {y ^ {*}} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{2} (\| \nu_ {H, t} \| ^ {2} - \| \tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} \| ^ {2}) - \frac {1}{2} \frac {\| (1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \alpha \gamma^ {*} \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime} \| ^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha) ^ {2}}, \\ \sigma_ {m ^ {*}, t} = (1 - \alpha) \frac {\sigma_ {t}}{2 \alpha - 1} - \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} i _ {2} - (\tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} - \nu_ {H, t}) ^ {\prime} + \frac {(1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3} + \alpha \gamma^ {*} \pi_ {t} (\tilde {\nu} _ {F , t} - \nu_ {H , t}) ^ {\prime}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}. \\ \end{array}
$$

We introduce a stochastic wedge  $\eta_t$  that reconciles the log change in exchange rates with the domestic and foreign consumption-based SDFs:

$$
d e _ {t} = d m _ {\nu_ {H}, t} - d m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {*} + d \eta_ {t}.
$$

Then, we can back up the stochastic wedge  $\eta_t$  process as

$$
\begin{array}{l} d \eta_ {t} = \left(\kappa_ {t} - \mu_ {m, t} + \mu_ {m ^ {*}, t}\right) d t + \left(\sigma_ {t} - \sigma_ {m, t} + \sigma_ {m ^ {*}, t}\right) d Z _ {t} \\ = \frac {1}{2} \left(\left\| \nu_ {H, t} \right\| ^ {2} - \left\| \tilde {\nu} _ {F, t} \right\| ^ {2}\right) d t + \left(\nu_ {H, t} - \tilde {\nu} _ {F, t}\right) ^ {\prime} d Z _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

(4) The interest rates and the home country market price of risk processes can be derived from the dynamics of  $\exp(m_{\nu_H,t})$ . We apply Ito's Lemma to  $\exp(m_{\nu_H,t})$  and match its drift and diffusion terms to obtain  $r_t$  and  $\lambda_t$ .

$$
r _ {t} = - \mu_ {m, t} - \frac {1}{2} \| \sigma_ {m, t} \| ^ {2}
$$

$$
\lambda_ {t} = - \sigma_ {m, t} ^ {\prime} - v _ {H, t}
$$

Given  $\lambda_{t}$  and  $r_t$ , we can calculate  $r_t^*$  using the definition of  $\lambda_{t}$

$$
r _ {t} ^ {*} = - \sigma_ {t} \lambda_ {t} + \kappa_ {t} - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} \sigma_ {t} ^ {\prime} + r _ {t}.
$$

# A.18 Proposition 5.3 in Section 5.A

Proof. Apply Ito's Lemma to  $\exp (tot_{t})$ , we obtain:

$$
\begin{array}{l} d \exp (t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}) = d \left(\frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \frac {y _ {t} ^ {*}}{y _ {t}}\right) \\ = \exp \left(t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) \left[ \frac {1}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} d y _ {t} ^ {*} - \frac {1}{y _ {t}} d y _ {t} - \frac {1}{y _ {t} y _ {t} ^ {*}} \left[ d y _ {t}, d y _ {t} ^ {*} \right] + \frac {1}{y _ {t} ^ {2}} \left[ d y _ {t}, d y _ {t} \right. \right. \\ + \frac {\alpha d \gamma_ {t}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \\ + \frac {1}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\left[ d y _ {t} ^ {*} , \alpha d \gamma_ {t} \right]}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} - \frac {1}{y _ {t}} \frac {\left[ d y _ {t} , \alpha d \gamma_ {t} \right]}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \\ - \frac {1}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\left[ d y _ {t} ^ {*} , (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} \right]}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} + \frac {1}{y _ {t}} \frac {\left[ d y _ {t} , (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} \right]}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \\ + \frac {[ (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} , (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} ]}{\left(\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha\right) ^ {2}} - \frac {\left[ \alpha d \gamma_ {t} , (1 - \alpha) d \gamma_ {t} \right]}{\left[ \gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha) \right] \left[ \gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha \right]} \\ \end{array}
$$

Again, conjecture that the logarithm of terms of trade follows

$$
d \left(t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) = A _ {t} ^ {c m} d t + B _ {t} ^ {c m} d Z _ {t}.
$$

If an equilibrium exists, by matching the drift and diffusion terms for  $\exp (tot_{t})$ ,

$$
d \exp (t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}) = \exp (t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}) (A _ {t} ^ {c m} + \frac {1}{2} | | B _ {t} ^ {c m} | | ^ {2}) d t + \exp (t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}) B _ {t} ^ {c m} d Z _ {t},
$$

we can compute  $A_{t}^{cm}$  and  $B_{t}^{cm}$  as follows:

$$
B _ {t} ^ {c m} = - \sigma_ {y} i _ {1} + \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} i _ {2} + \frac {\alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha}
$$

$$
A _ {t} ^ {c m} = \mu_ {y ^ {*}} - \mu_ {y} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \frac {\alpha^ {2} \gamma_ {t} ^ {2} \omega^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)) ^ {2}} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {(1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \gamma_ {t} ^ {2} \omega^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha) ^ {2}}
$$

Matching the drift and volatility terms of the log exchange rate, we have

$$
d \left(e _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) = d \left(\left(2 \alpha - 1\right) t o t _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) = \left(2 \alpha - 1\right) A _ {t} ^ {c m} d t + \left(2 \alpha - 1\right) B _ {t} ^ {c m} d Z _ {t}.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\kappa_ {t} ^ {c m} = (2 \alpha - 1) A _ {t} ^ {c m},
$$

$$
\sigma_ {t} ^ {c m} = (2 \alpha - 1) B _ {t} ^ {c m}.
$$

Under complete markets, we have a unique home country state price density:

$$
d \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) = - r _ {t} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) d t - \lambda_ {t} ^ {\prime} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) d Z _ {t}, \tag {A.26}
$$

and a unique home country state price density:

$$
d \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {*}, c m\right) = - r _ {t} ^ {*} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {*}, c m\right) d t - \lambda_ {t} ^ {* \prime} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {*}, c m\right) d Z _ {t}, \tag {A.27}
$$

Given the formula of the home numétaire, we have

$$
\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} = p _ {t} ^ {\alpha} \left[ p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {c m}) \right] ^ {1 - \alpha}.
$$

Therefore, the home household's consumption-based home country stochastic price density is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} p _ {t} ^ {\alpha} \left[ p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp \left(- e _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) \right] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} p _ {t} ^ {\alpha} \left[ p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {c m}) \right] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0}}{p _ {t}} \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {0} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \frac {y _ {0}}{y _ {t}} \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} \left[ \frac {p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {c m})}{p _ {t}} \right] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp (- \delta t) \left[ \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {0} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \right] \left[ \frac {y _ {0}}{y _ {t}} \right] p _ {0} \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} \exp ((\alpha - 1) t o t _ {t} ^ {c m} - \delta t) \left[ \frac {\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}{\gamma_ {0} \alpha + \pi \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)} \right] \left[ \frac {y _ {0}}{y _ {t}} \right] p _ {0} \\ \end{array}
$$

It follows that

$$
d \exp (m _ {t} ^ {c m}) = \exp (m _ {t} ^ {c m}) \left(\mu_ {m, t} ^ {c m} + \frac {1}{2} \| \sigma_ {m, t} ^ {c m} \| ^ {2}\right) d t + \exp (m _ {t} ^ {c m}) \sigma_ {m, t} ^ {c m} d Z _ {t}
$$

where

$$
\mu_ {m, t} ^ {c m} = - \delta + (\alpha - 1) A _ {t} ^ {c m} - \mu_ {y} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {y} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \frac {\alpha^ {2} \gamma_ {t} ^ {2} \omega^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)) ^ {2}}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {m, t} ^ {c m} = (\alpha - 1) B _ {t} ^ {c m} - \sigma_ {y} i _ {1} + \frac {\alpha \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3}}{\gamma_ {t} \alpha + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} (1 - \alpha)}
$$

Similarly, for the foreign numétaire, we have

$$
\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} = p _ {t} ^ {* \alpha} \left[ p _ {t} \exp \left(e _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) \right] ^ {1 - \alpha}.
$$

Then, by the formula of the home numérique, the foreign household's consumption-based foreign country stochastic price density is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {*}, c m\right) = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} p _ {t} ^ {* \alpha} \left[ p _ {t} \exp \left(e _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) \right] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {*}, c m\right) \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} p _ {t} ^ {* \alpha} \left[ p _ {t} \exp \left(e _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) \right] ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {\exp \left(e _ {0} ^ {c m}\right)}{\exp \left(e _ {t} ^ {c m}\right)} \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0} ^ {*} \exp \left(- e _ {0} ^ {c m}\right) y _ {0} ^ {*}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp \left(- e _ {t} ^ {c m}\right) y _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} \left[ \frac {p _ {t} \exp \left(e _ {t} ^ {c m}\right)}{p _ {t} ^ {*}} \right] ^ {1 - \alpha} \exp (- \delta t) \frac {p _ {0} ^ {*} y _ {0} ^ {*}}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \\ = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} \exp ((1 - \alpha) t o t _ {t} ^ {c m} - \delta t) \left[ \frac {\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha}{\gamma_ {0} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha} \right] \left[ \frac {y _ {0} ^ {*}}{y _ {t} ^ {*}} \right] p _ {0} ^ {*} \\ \end{array}
$$

It follows that

$$
d \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {* c m}\right) = \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {* c m}\right) \left(\mu_ {m ^ {*}, t} ^ {c m} + \frac {1}{2} \| \sigma_ {m ^ {*}, t} ^ {c m} \| ^ {2}\right) d t + \exp \left(m _ {\nu_ {F} ^ {*}, t} ^ {* c m}\right) \sigma_ {m ^ {*}, t} ^ {c m} d Z _ {t}
$$

where

$$
\mu_ {m ^ {*}, t} ^ {c m} = - \delta + (1 - \alpha) A _ {t} ^ {c m} - \mu_ {y ^ {*}} - \frac {1}{2} \frac {(1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \gamma_ {t} ^ {2} \omega^ {2}}{(\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi \gamma^ {*} \alpha) ^ {2}}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {m ^ {*}, t} ^ {c m} = (1 - \alpha) B _ {t} ^ {c m} - \sigma_ {y ^ {*}} i _ {2} + \frac {(1 - \alpha) \gamma_ {t} \omega i _ {3}}{\gamma_ {t} (1 - \alpha) + \pi_ {t} \gamma^ {*} \alpha}
$$

Then, the exchange rate dynamics is back in the benchmark complete markets case:

$$
d e _ {t} ^ {c m} = d m _ {t} ^ {c m} - d m _ {t} ^ {* c m}
$$

□

# A.19 Proposition 5.4 in Section 5.B

Proof. First, we plug in  $\Delta e_{t + 1} = m_{t + 1} - m_{t + 1}^{*} + \eta_{t + 1}$  to reproduce the Euler equations (1.6)-(1.9) as follows

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \eta_ {t + 1} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + r _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \right],
$$

$$
1 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(m _ {t + 1} + \eta_ {t + 1} + r _ {t}\right) \right].
$$

By joint normality, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) + r _ {t}, \\ 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) + r _ {t} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \eta_ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\eta_ {t + 1}) + c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}, \eta_ {t + 1}), \\ 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) + r _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) + r _ {t} ^ {*} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \eta_ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\eta_ {t + 1}) - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \eta_ {t + 1}), \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies

$$
c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, \eta_ {t + 1}\right) = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \eta_ {t + 1} \right] - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\eta_ {t + 1}\right),
$$

$$
c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \eta_ {t + 1}\right) = - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \eta_ {t + 1} \right] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\eta_ {t + 1}\right),
$$

and hence

$$
c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \eta_ {t + 1}) = - v a r _ {t} (\eta_ {t + 1}).
$$

Recall

$$
\Delta e _ {t + 1} = m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \eta_ {t + 1},
$$

which gives the following moments

$$
\begin{array}{l} v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) + v a r _ {t} \left(\eta_ {t + 1}\right) + 2 c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \eta_ {t + 1}\right) \\ = v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) - v a r _ {t} \left(\eta_ {t + 1}\right), \\ \end{array}

$$

# A.20 Proposition 5.5 in Section 5.B

Proof. By construction,  $cov_{t}(m_{t + 1},w_{t}\varepsilon_{t + 1}) = cov_{t}(m_{t + 1}^{*},w_{t}\varepsilon_{t + 1}) = 0$ . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(x _ {t} + y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}\right) \\ = v a r _ {t} \left(y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) + v a r _ {t} \left(w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies (a). Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{l} c o v _ {t} \big (\Delta e _ {t + 1}, m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} \big) = c o v _ {t} \big (x _ {t} + y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}, m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} \big) \\ = c o v _ {t} \left(y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies (b). Define  $rp_{t} = \mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta e_{t + 1} + r_{t}^{*} - r_{t}]$ . Euler equations (1.6) and (1.7) yield

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) + r _ {t}, \\ 0 = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}) - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}) + r _ {t} ^ {*}, \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies

$$
r p _ {t} = - c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right).
$$

Similarly, Eq. (1.8) and (1.9) imply

$$
r p _ {t} = - c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right).
$$

Adding together to cancel  $\frac{1}{2} var_{t}(\Delta e_{t + 1})$  and obtain (c)

$$
\begin{array}{l} r p _ {t} = - \frac {1}{2} c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) - \frac {1}{2} c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) \\ = - \frac {1}{2} c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} + m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) \\ = - \frac {1}{2} c o v _ {t} \left(y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, m _ {t + 1} + m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

# A.21 Proposition 5.6 in Section 5.B

Proof. The Euler equation Eq. (5.18) implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} - \left(m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right)\right) \\ = c o v _ {t} \left(y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}, \left(y _ {t} - 1\right) m _ {t + 1} + \left(z _ {t} + 1\right) m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}\right) \\ = y _ {t} \left(y _ {t} - 1\right) \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}\right) + z _ {t} \left(z _ {t} + 1\right) \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \\ + \left[ y _ {t} (z _ {t} + 1) + z _ {t} (y _ {t} - 1) \right] c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}, m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) + w _ {t} ^ {2}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where we use the fact that by construction,  $cov_{t}(w_{t}\varepsilon_{t + 1},m_{t + 1}) = cov_{t}(w_{t}\varepsilon_{t + 1},m_{t + 1}^{*}) = 0$ .  $w_{t}^{2} \geq 0$  leads to constraint Eq. (5.15).

The Euler equation Eq. (5.18) also implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) = \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}, m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \\ = c o v _ {t} \left(y _ {t} m _ {t + 1} + z _ {t} m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + w _ {t} \varepsilon_ {t + 1}, m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \\ = y _ {t} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}\right) - z _ {t} \operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) + \left(z _ {t} - y _ {t}\right) \operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1}. m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

which leads to constraint Eq. (5.16).

# A.22 Proposition 5.7 in Section 5.C.

Proof. Recast the Euler equation between country 1 and 2 to obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = c o v _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {1 / 2}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {1 / 2} - \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)}\right) \right] \\ = c o v _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2} - \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1}, \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2} - \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)}\right)\right) - \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1} - \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)}\right)\right) \right] \\ = c o v _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1} - \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)}\right) \right] + c o v _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2} - \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)}\right) \right] \\ - c o v _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1} - (m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)}) ] - c o v _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2} - (m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)}) ], \\ \end{array}
$$

where the first two terms are zero from the Euler equations (5.18) and (5.19). Hence,

$$
0 = c o v _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1} - (m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)}) ] + c o v _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} ^ {0 / 2} - (m _ {t + 1} ^ {(0)} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {(2)}) ].

# A.23 Proposition 5.8 in Section 5.C.

Proof. Assume the equity claims (i.e., endowment claims) and risk-free bonds are tradable. Assume the endowment and demand shock processes are exogenous and adapted to the filtration that is generated by some  $d$ -dimensional Brownian motion  $Z_{t}$ . The set of tradable assets does not span all the Brownian shocks. In each country  $i$ , the households' problem is given by

$$
\max  _ {c _ {0, t} ^ {(i)}, c _ {1, t} ^ {(i)}, c _ {2, t} ^ {(i)}} \quad \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \rho t) \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)} \left(\alpha \log c _ {i, t} ^ {(i)} + \sum_ {j \neq i} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} \log c _ {j , t} ^ {(i)}\right) d t \right]
$$

subject to the following dynamic budget constraint

$$
d w _ {t} ^ {(i)} = w _ {t} ^ {(i)} (r _ {t} ^ {(i)} + (\mathbf {x} _ {t} ^ {(i)}) ^ {\prime} (\mu_ {t} ^ {(i)} - r _ {t} ^ {(i)} \mathbf {1})) d t + w _ {t} ^ {(i)} ((\mathbf {x} _ {t} ^ {(i)}) ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {t} ^ {(i)}) d Z _ {t} - \sum_ {j \in \{0, 1, 2 \}} p _ {t} ^ {(j)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {i / j}) c _ {j, t} ^ {(i)} d t,
$$

where  $p_t^{(j)}$  is the price of good  $j$  in the numérique of country  $j$ 's consumption bundle  $c_t^{(j)} = \exp(\alpha \log c_{i,t}^{(i)} + \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1 - \alpha}{2} \log c_{j,t}^{(i)})$ , and  $e_t^{i/j}$

denotes the bilateral exchange rate, which takes a higher value if currency in country  $i$  is stronger.  $\mathbf{x}_t^{(i)}$  is the column vector of portfolio weights for investors in country  $i$ ,  $\mu_t^{(i)}$  is the column vector of expected return of risky assets in country  $i$ 's numérique, and  $\sigma_t^{(i)}$  is the corresponding volatility matrix.

Following He and Pearson [1991], Cuoco and He [1994] and Pavlova and Rigobon [2012], we can solve the system by transforming the dynamic budget constraints to a static one, which is given by

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {(i)}\right) c _ {t} ^ {(i)} \right] \leq w _ {0} ^ {(i)}, \tag {A.28}
$$

where  $\exp(m_t^{(i)})$  is the state price density in country  $i$ . The households' Lagrangian is given by

$$
\mathcal {L} = \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \rho t) \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)} \log c _ {t} ^ {(i)} d t + \zeta^ {(i)} \left(w _ {0} ^ {(i)} - \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (m _ {t} ^ {(i)}) c _ {t} ^ {(i)} d t\right) \right],
$$

which yields the following first-order condition

$$
\frac {\exp (- \rho t) \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)}}{c _ {t} ^ {(i)}} = \zeta^ {(i)} \exp \left(m _ {t} ^ {(i)}\right), \tag {A.29}
$$

with the normalization  $\exp(m_0^{(i)}) = 1$ . When markets are incomplete, there are an infinite number of SDFs that correctly price the assets. However, the SDF that coincides with the marginal utility is unique and is given by (A.29).

The households' wealth in period  $t$  is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {t} ^ {(i)} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {\exp (m _ {u} ^ {(i)})}{\exp (m _ {t} ^ {(i)})} c _ {u} ^ {(i)} d u \right] = \frac {\zeta^ {(i)}}{\exp (- \rho_ {t}) \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)}} c _ {t} ^ {(i)} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {\exp (- \rho u) \gamma_ {u} ^ {(i)}}{\zeta^ {(i)} c _ {u} ^ {(i)}} c _ {u} ^ {(i)} d u \right] \\ = \frac {1 - \exp (- \rho (T - t))}{\rho} c _ {t} ^ {(i)}, \tag {A.30} \\ \end{array}
$$

where the demand shocks  $\gamma_t^{(i)}$  are assumed to be martingales. Going back to households' problem, the within-period first-order conditions yields

$$
p _ {t} ^ {(j)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {i / j}) c _ {j, t} ^ {(i)} = (1 _ {\{i = j \}} \alpha + 1 _ {\{i \neq j \}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}) c _ {t} ^ {(i)}.
$$

Next, the equilibrium allocation is not necessarily Pareto optimal with incomplete markets. However, as shown in Cuoco and He [1994] and Pavlova and Rigobon [2012], we can still solve the social planner's problem with stochastic weights  $\pi_t^{(i)}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \max _ {c ^ {(i) j, t}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {T} \exp (- \rho t) \sum_ {i \in \{0, 1, 2 \}} \pi_ {t} ^ {(i)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)} \sum_ {j \in \{0, 1, 2 \}} \left(1 _ {\{i = j \}} \alpha + 1 _ {\{i \neq j \}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}\right) \log c _ {j, t} ^ {(i)} d t \right], \\ s. t. \quad \sum_ {i \in \{0, 1, 2 \}} c _ {j, t} ^ {(i)} = y _ {t} ^ {(j)}, \quad j \in \{0, 1, 2 \}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The first-order conditions imply

$$
c _ {j, t} ^ {(i)} = \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(i)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\sum_ {i \neq j} \pi_ {t} ^ {(i)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \pi_ {t} ^ {(j)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(j)} \alpha} y _ {t} ^ {(j)}, i \neq j
$$

$$
c _ {j, t} ^ {(j)} = \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(j)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(j)} \alpha}{\sum_ {i \neq j} \pi_ {t} ^ {(i)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \pi_ {t} ^ {(j)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(j)} \alpha} y _ {t} ^ {(j)}.
$$

In country 0, the within-period solution implies

$$
p _ {t} ^ {(1)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 1}) c _ {1, t} ^ {(0)} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} c _ {t} ^ {(0)}
$$

$$
p _ {t} ^ {(2)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 2}) c _ {2, t} ^ {(0)} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} c _ {t} ^ {(0)}
$$

Let  $q_{t}^{1/2}$  denotes the terms of trade in log between countries 1 and 2, which is the ratio of goods prices in a common numérique. Dividing the first equation above by the second yields

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (q _ {t} ^ {1 / 2}) = \frac {p _ {t} ^ {(1)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 1})}{p _ {t} ^ {(2)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 2})} \\ = \frac {c _ {2 , t} ^ {(0)}}{c _ {1 , t} ^ {(0)}} = \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)} \alpha + \pi_ {t} ^ {(2)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \pi_ {t} ^ {(2)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)} \alpha} \frac {y _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{y _ {t} ^ {(1)}}. \tag {A.31} \\ \end{array}
$$

To make comparison across countries, define  $\tilde{w}_t^{(i)} = w_t^{(i)}\exp (-e_t^{0 / i})$  as country  $i$  's wealth in country 0's numeraire. Below, we show that  $\pi_t^{(i)}\gamma_t^{(i)} / \pi_t^{(j)}\gamma_t^{(j)} = \tilde{w}_t^{(i)} / \tilde{w}_t^{(j)}$ . To see this, note that

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {t} ^ {(1)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 1}) = p _ {t} ^ {(0)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {1 / 0}) \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 1}) c _ {0, t} ^ {(1)} + p _ {t} ^ {(1)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 1}) c _ {1, t} ^ {(1)} + p _ {t} ^ {(2)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {1 / 2}) \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 1}) c _ {2, t} ^ {(1)} \\ = p _ {t} ^ {(0)} c _ {0, t} ^ {(1)} + p _ {t} ^ {(1)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 1}) c _ {1, t} ^ {(1)} + p _ {t} ^ {(2)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 2}) c _ {2, t} ^ {(1)} \\ = \alpha \frac {c _ {0 , t} ^ {(1)}}{c _ {0 , t} ^ {(0)}} c _ {t} ^ {(0)} + \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} \frac {c _ {1 , t} ^ {(1)}}{c _ {1 , t} ^ {(0)}} c _ {t} ^ {(0)} + \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} \frac {c _ {2 , t} ^ {(1)}}{c _ {2 , t} ^ {(0)}} c _ {t} ^ {(0)} \\ = \left(\alpha \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)} \alpha} + \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)} \alpha}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}} + \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}\right) c _ {t} ^ {(0)} \\ = \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} c _ {t} ^ {(0)}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Hence, by Eq. (A.30),

$$
\frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} = \frac {c _ {t} ^ {(1)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 1})}{c _ {t} ^ {(0)}} = \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}}.
$$

Similarly,

$$
\frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} = \frac {c _ {t} ^ {(2)} \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {0 / 2})}{c _ {t} ^ {(0)}} = \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(2)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}}.
$$

Plug in Eq. (A.31) to obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} q _ {t} ^ {1 / 2} = \log \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)} \alpha + \pi_ {t} ^ {(2)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \pi_ {t} ^ {(2)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)} \alpha} + \log \frac {y _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{y _ {t} ^ {(1)}} \\ = \log \frac {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \alpha + \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(2)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\pi_ {t} ^ {(2)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\pi_ {t} ^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \alpha} + \log \frac {y _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{y _ {t} ^ {(1)}} \tag {A.32} \\ = \log \frac {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} \alpha + \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {(0)}} \alpha} + \log \frac {y _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{y _ {t} ^ {(1)}} \\ \end{array}
$$

When markets are complete, the Pareto weights are constant, i.e.  $\pi_t^{(i)} = \pi^{(i)}$ . Plugging in Eq. (A.32) yields

$$
q _ {t} ^ {1 / 2, c m} = \log \frac {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\pi^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\pi^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \alpha + \frac {\pi^ {(2)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\pi^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}{\frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\pi^ {(1)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(1)}}{\pi^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \frac {1 - \alpha}{2} + \frac {\pi^ {(2)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(2)}}{\pi^ {(0)} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(0)}} \alpha} + \log \frac {y _ {t} ^ {(2)}}{y _ {t} ^ {(1)}}.
$$

Finally, we derive the exchange rate as a function of the terms of trade.  $p_t^{(1)}c_{1,t}^{(1)} = \alpha c_t^{(1)}$  implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} p _ {t} ^ {(1)} c _ {1, t} ^ {(1)} = \alpha (c _ {1, t} ^ {(1)}) ^ {\alpha} (c _ {2, t} ^ {(1)}) ^ {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2}} (c _ {3, t} ^ {(1)}) ^ {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2}} \\ p _ {t} ^ {(1)} = \alpha \left(\frac {c _ {2 , t} ^ {(1)}}{c _ {1 , t} ^ {(1)}} \frac {c _ {3 , t} ^ {(1)}}{c _ {1 , t} ^ {(1)}}\right) ^ {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2}} = \alpha \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{2 \alpha} \exp (q _ {t} ^ {1 / 2}) \exp (q _ {t} ^ {1 / 3})\right) ^ {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2}}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Similarly,  $p_t^{(2)} = \alpha \left(\frac{1 - \alpha}{2\alpha}\exp (q_t^{2 / 1})\exp (q_t^{2 / 3})\right)^{\frac{1 - \alpha}{2}}$ . Recall that  $\exp (q_t^{1 / 2}) = p_t^{(1)}\exp (e_t^{1 / 2}) / p_t^{(2)}$ , which implies

$$
\exp (q _ {t} ^ {1 / 2}) \exp (- e _ {t} ^ {1 / 2}) = \frac {p _ {t} ^ {(1)}}{p _ {t} ^ {(2)}} = \left(\frac {\exp (q _ {t} ^ {1 / 2}) \exp (q _ {t} ^ {1 / 3})}{\exp (q _ {t} ^ {2 / 1}) \exp (q _ {t} ^ {2 / 3})}\right) ^ {\frac {1 - \alpha}{2}} = \exp \left(\frac {3 (1 - \alpha)}{2} q _ {t} ^ {1 / 2}\right).
$$

Hence, the log bilateral exchange rate is linear in the log terms of trade:

$$
e _ {t} ^ {1 / 2} = \frac {3 \alpha - 1}{2} q _ {t} ^ {1 / 2},
$$

which concludes the proof.

# A.24 Proposition 6.2 and 6.3 in Section 6.C

Proof. Consider the general case in Proposition 6.3. By market clearing and price setting,

$$
z _ {t} \ell_ {t} = \frac {P _ {t} c _ {t}}{P _ {H , t}} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right)
$$

$$
z _ {t} ^ {*} \ell_ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}}{P _ {F , t} ^ {*}} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}}\right).
$$

By  $W_{t} = \kappa P_{t}c_{t}\ell_{t}^{\nu}$

$$
\frac {P _ {t} c _ {t}}{P _ {H , t}} = \frac {\rho - 1}{\kappa \rho} z _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {- \nu}
$$

Let  $\bar{\ell} = \frac{\rho - 1}{\rho\kappa}$ . The market clearing equations become

$$
\ell_ {t} ^ {1 + \nu} = \bar {\ell} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right)
$$

By the market clearing equations again,

$$
z _ {t} \bar {\ell} \ell_ {t} ^ {- \nu} = \frac {P _ {t} c _ {t}}{P _ {H , t}}
$$

$$
c _ {t} = z _ {t} \bar {\ell} \ell_ {t} ^ {- \nu} \frac {P _ {H , t}}{P _ {t}} = \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \bar {\ell} \ell_ {t} ^ {- \nu} z _ {t} \frac {P _ {H , t}}{P _ {H , t} ^ {\alpha} P _ {F , t} ^ {1 - \alpha}}
$$

By price setting,

$$
\frac {P _ {H , t}}{P _ {F , t}} = \frac {\frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \frac {W _ {t}}{z _ {t}}}{\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \frac {W _ {t} ^ {*}}{z _ {t} ^ {*}}} = \frac {\frac {P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t}}}{\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) \frac {P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t} ^ {*}}} = \frac {z _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \nu}}{z _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {- \nu}}
$$

so

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log c _ {t} = \log \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \bar {\ell} + \alpha (\log z _ {t} - \nu \log \ell_ {t}) + (1 - \alpha) (\log z _ {t} ^ {*} - \nu \log \ell_ {t} ^ {*}) \\ = \log \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} + \frac {1}{1 + \nu} \log \bar {\ell} + \alpha \log z _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) \log z _ {t} ^ {*} \\ - \frac {\nu}{1 + \nu} \left(\alpha \log \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) + (1 - \alpha) \log \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}}\right)\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

To solve this equation system, we linearize spending  $g_{t} / c_{t}$  and  $g_{t}^{*} / c_{t}^{*}$  around o:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log c _ {t} = \log \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} + \frac {1}{1 + \nu} \log \bar {\ell} + \alpha \log z _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) \log z _ {t} ^ {*} \\ \left. - \frac {\nu}{1 + \nu} \left(\alpha \left(\alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) + (1 - \alpha) \left(\alpha \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}}\right)\right) \right. \\ \end{array}
$$

which simplifies to

$$
\log c _ {t} - \log \bar {c} \approx \alpha \log z _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) \log z _ {t} ^ {*} - \frac {\nu}{1 + \nu} \left((\alpha^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2}) \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + 2 (1 - \alpha) \alpha \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right),
$$

Similarly, the foreign counterpart is

$$
\log c _ {t} ^ {*} - \log \bar {c} \approx (1 - \alpha) \log z _ {t} + \alpha \log z _ {t} ^ {*} - \frac {\nu}{1 + \nu} \left((\alpha^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2}) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}} + 2 (1 - \alpha) \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}}\right),
$$

Hence, the equilibrium foreign real exchange rate is

$$
\begin{array}{l} - e _ {t} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \log \frac {P _ {t} ^ {*}}{P _ {t}} \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) = \log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*} \\ \approx (2 \alpha - 1) (\log z _ {t} - \log z _ {t} ^ {*}) - \frac {\nu}{1 + \nu} (2 \alpha - 1) ^ {2} \left(\frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} - \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

Plug in  $\nu = 0$  to get Proposition 6.2.

# A.25 Proposition 6.4 in Section 6.D

Proof. When prices are sticky, the model is closed by the following equations for prices:

$$
P _ {H, t} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \frac {W _ {t}}{z _ {t}} \right] \quad \exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t}) P _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \frac {W _ {t}}{z _ {t}} \right] \tag {A.33}
$$

$$
\exp \left(\mathcal {E} _ {t}\right) P _ {F, t} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \frac {W _ {t} ^ {*}}{z _ {t} ^ {*}} \right] \quad P _ {F, t} ^ {*} = \frac {\rho}{\rho - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \frac {W _ {t} ^ {*}}{z _ {t} ^ {*}} \right] \tag {A.34}
$$

Just as in the flexible price case,

$$
z _ {t} \ell_ {t} = \frac {P _ {t} c _ {t}}{P _ {H , t}} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) \tag {A.35}
$$

Also use Eq. (A.33),

$$
\ell_ {t} = \frac {P _ {t} c _ {t}}{P _ {H , t} z _ {t}} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) = \frac {P _ {t} c _ {t} / z _ {t}}{\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} \right]} \bar {\ell} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right)
$$

Use Eq. (A.35) again,

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {t} = z _ {t} \ell_ {t} \cdot \frac {P _ {H , t}}{P _ {t}} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {g _ {t}}{c _ {t}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {g _ {t} ^ {*}}{c _ {t} ^ {*}}\right) ^ {- 1} = \frac {P _ {H , t}}{\frac {1}{\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}} P _ {H , t} ^ {\alpha} P _ {F , t} ^ {1 - \alpha}} \frac {P _ {t} c _ {t}}{\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} \right]} \bar {\ell} \\ = \frac {P _ {t} c _ {t}}{\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} \right]} \bar {\ell} (\alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}) \frac {P _ {H , t} ^ {1 - \alpha}}{P _ {F , t} ^ {1 - \alpha}} \\ \end{array}
$$

Use the price setting Eq. (A.33) and (A.34),

$$
\frac {P _ {H , t}}{P _ {F , t}} = \frac {1}{\exp (- \mathcal {E} _ {t})} \frac {\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ W _ {t} / z _ {t} ]}{\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ W _ {t} ^ {*} / z _ {t} ^ {*} ]} = \frac {P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}}{P _ {t} c _ {t}} \frac {\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ]}{\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {\nu}) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} ]}
$$

Then

$$
c _ {t} = \bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {(P _ {t} c _ {t}) ^ {\alpha} (P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ]) ^ {\alpha} (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} ]) ^ {1 - \alpha}}
$$

So the equilibrium price levels and consumption can be solved by

$$
c _ {t} = \bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {\left(P _ {t} c _ {t}\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{\left(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} \right]\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} \left(\ell_ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} \right]\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}}
$$

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} = \bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {(P _ {t} c _ {t}) ^ {1 - \alpha} (P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha}}{(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ]) ^ {1 - \alpha} (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} ]) ^ {\alpha}}
$$

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {Q _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = t + 1} ^ {\infty} \beta^ {k - t} \frac {s _ {k}}{c _ {k}} \right]},
$$

$$
P _ {t} ^ {*} = \frac {Q _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = t + 1} ^ {\infty} \beta^ {k - t} \frac {s _ {k} ^ {*}}{c _ {k} ^ {*}} \right]}.
$$

which implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log c _ {t} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c} + \alpha \log \left(P _ {t} c _ {t}\right) + (1 - \alpha) \log \left(P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \\ \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}} + \alpha \log (P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}) + (1 - \alpha) \log (P _ {t} c _ {t}) \\ - e _ {t} = \log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {e} + (2 \alpha - 1) \left(\log \left(P _ {t} c _ {t}\right) - \log \left(P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*}\right)\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

where

$$
\kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c} = \log \left(\frac {\bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ]) ^ {\alpha} (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} ]) ^ {1 - \alpha}}\right)
$$

$$
\kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c} = \log \left(\frac {\bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ]) ^ {1 - \alpha} (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ P _ {t} ^ {*} c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} ]) ^ {\alpha}}\right)
$$

$$
\kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {e} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c} - \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}}
$$

# A.26 Proposition 6.5 in Section 6.D

Proof. Plug in Eq. (6.15) into Proposition 6.4 to get

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log c _ {t} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c} - \alpha \left(i _ {t} + \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1}} \right]\right) - (1 - \alpha) \left(i _ {t} ^ {*} + \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} ^ {*} c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}} \right]\right) \\ = \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c} - \alpha i _ {t} - (1 - \alpha) i _ {t} ^ {*} \\ \end{array}
$$

similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}} - \alpha \left(i _ {t} ^ {*} + \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} ^ {*} c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}} \right]\right) - (1 - \alpha) \left(i _ {t} + \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1}} \right]\right) \\ = \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}} - \alpha i _ {t} ^ {*} - (1 - \alpha) i _ {t} \\ \end{array}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l} \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c} - \alpha \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1}} \right] - (1 - \alpha) \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} ^ {*} c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}} \right] \\ \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}} = \kappa_ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}} - \alpha \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} ^ {*} c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}} \right] - (1 - \alpha) \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1}} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Recall the real Euler equation:

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t} = - \log \delta - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ c _ {t} / c _ {t + 1} \right] \\ = - \log \delta - \log c _ {t} - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ 1 / c _ {t + 1} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Plugging log consumption into the equation above yields:

$$
r _ {t} = \bar {r} + \alpha i _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) i _ {t} ^ {*}.
$$

where

$$
\bar {r} = - \log \delta - \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c} - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ 1 / c _ {t + 1} \right]
$$

the equilibrium log real exchange rate is

$$
- e _ {t} = \log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c} - \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c ^ {*}} - (2 \alpha - 1) (i _ {t} - i _ {t} ^ {*})
$$

and the equilibrium price levels can be pinned down by plugging consumption into Eq. (6.15)

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log P _ {t} = - \log c _ {t} - i _ {t} - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1}} \right] \\ = - \tilde {\kappa} _ {t - 1} ^ {c} - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \frac {1}{P _ {t + 1} c _ {t + 1}} \right] + (1 - \alpha) (i _ {t} ^ {*} - i _ {t}) \\ \end{array}

c _ {t} = \bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {\left(\frac {1}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A} c _ {t}\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(\frac {1}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}} c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{\left(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \frac {1}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} \right]\right) ^ {\alpha} \left(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \frac {1}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}} c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} \right]\right) ^ {1 - \alpha}}
$$

$$
c _ {t} ^ {*} = \bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \frac {(\frac {1}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A} c _ {t}) ^ {1 - \alpha} (\frac {1}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}} c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\alpha}}{(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {1}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A} c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ]) ^ {1 - \alpha} (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {1}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}} c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu} / z _ {t} ^ {*} ]) ^ {\alpha}}.
$$

By the i.i.d. assumption of  $s_t, s_t^*, z_t$ , and  $z_t^*$ , the expectation terms  $\mathbb{E}_{t-1} \left[ \frac{1}{s_t + c_t A} c_t \ell_t^\nu / z_t \right]$  and  $\mathbb{E}_{t-1} \left[ \frac{1}{s_t^* + c_t^* A^*} c_t^* (\ell_t^*)^\nu / z_t^* \right]$  do not vary across periods. The two equations above can be used to solve  $c_t$  and  $c_t^*$  as functions of  $s_t$  and  $s_t^*$ , which confirms the conjecture.

Take log,

$$
\log c _ {t} = \log \frac {\bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {c _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A} \frac {\ell_ {t} ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t}} ]) ^ {\alpha} (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}} \frac {(\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t} ^ {*}} ]) ^ {1 - \alpha}} + \alpha \log (\frac {c _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}) + (1 - \alpha) \log (\frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}})
$$

$$
\log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \log \frac {\bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}}{(\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {c _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A} \frac {\ell_ {t} ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t}} ]) ^ {1 - \alpha} (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}} \frac {(\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t} ^ {*}} ]) ^ {\alpha}} + (1 - \alpha) \log (\frac {c _ {t}}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A}) + \alpha \log (\frac {c _ {t} ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}})
$$

Take first-order approximation around  $s_t = \bar{s}$  and  $c_t = \bar{c}$ ,

$$
\log \left(s _ {t} + c _ {t} A\right) \approx \log (\bar {s} + \bar {c} A) + \frac {1}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} \left(s _ {t} - \bar {s}\right) + \frac {\bar {c} A}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} \left(\log c _ {t} - \log \bar {c}\right)
$$

$$
\log \left(s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}\right) \approx \log \left(\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}\right) + \frac {1}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} \left(s _ {t} ^ {*} - \bar {s}\right) + \frac {\bar {c} A ^ {*}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} \left(\log c _ {t} ^ {*} - \log \bar {c}\right)
$$

Then, the system of equations becomes

$$
\frac {(1 - \alpha) \bar {s} + \bar {c} A}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} \log c _ {t} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) \bar {s}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa_ {2} - \frac {\alpha}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} s _ {t} - \frac {1 - \alpha}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} s _ {t} ^ {*}
$$

$$
\frac {(1 - \alpha) \bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} \log c _ {t} ^ {*} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) \bar {s}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} \log c _ {t} = \kappa_ {2} ^ {*} - \frac {\alpha}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} s _ {t} ^ {*} - \frac {1 - \alpha}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} s _ {t}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l} \kappa_ {2} = \log (\bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}) - \alpha \log (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {\bar {s} + \bar {c} A}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A} \frac {c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t}} ]) - (1 - \alpha) \log (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}} \frac {c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t} ^ {*}} ]) \\ + \alpha \frac {\bar {s}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {\bar {s}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} + \alpha \frac {\bar {c} A}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} \log \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {\bar {c} A ^ {*}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} \log \bar {c} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \kappa_ {2} ^ {*} = \log (\bar {\ell} \alpha^ {\alpha} (1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha}) - (1 - \alpha) \log (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {\bar {s} + \bar {c} A}{s _ {t} + c _ {t} A} \frac {c _ {t} \ell_ {t} ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t}} ]) - \alpha \log (\mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \frac {\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}}{s _ {t} ^ {*} + c _ {t} ^ {*} A ^ {*}} \frac {c _ {t} ^ {*} (\ell_ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {\nu}}{z _ {t} ^ {*}} ]) \\ + \alpha \frac {\bar {s}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {\bar {s}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} + \alpha \frac {\bar {c} A ^ {*}}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A ^ {*}} \log \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \frac {\bar {c} A}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} \log \bar {c} \\ \end{array}
$$

The solution is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log c _ {t} = \kappa_ {c} - \frac {\left((1 - \alpha) \bar {s} + \alpha A ^ {*} \bar {c}\right) s _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) \left(A \bar {c} + \bar {s}\right) s _ {t} ^ {*}}{\bar {c} \left(A A ^ {*} \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} \left(A + A ^ {*}\right)\right)} \\ \log c _ {t} ^ {*} = \kappa_ {C} ^ {*} - \frac {(1 - \alpha) (A ^ {*} \bar {c} + \bar {s}) s _ {t} + ((1 - \alpha) \bar {s} + \alpha A \bar {c}) s _ {t} ^ {*}}{\bar {c} (A A ^ {*} \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} (A + A ^ {*}))} \\ \end{array}
$$

where

$$
\kappa_ {c} = \frac {\left(A \bar {c} + \bar {s}\right) \left(A ^ {*} \bar {c} \kappa_ {2} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} \left(\kappa_ {2} + \kappa_ {2} ^ {*}\right)\right)}{\bar {c} \left(A A ^ {*} \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} \left(A + A ^ {*}\right)\right)}
$$

$$
\kappa_ {c} ^ {*} = \frac {\left(A ^ {*} \bar {c} + \bar {s}\right) \left(A \bar {c} \kappa_ {2} ^ {*} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} \left(\kappa_ {2} + \kappa_ {2} ^ {*}\right)\right)}{\bar {c} \left(A A ^ {*} \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} \left(A + A ^ {*}\right)\right)}
$$

Recall the real Euler equation:

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t} = - \log \delta - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ c _ {t} / c _ {t + 1} \right] \\ = - \log \delta - \log c _ {t} - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ 1 / c _ {t + 1} ] \\ \end{array}
$$

Plugging log consumption into the equation above yields:

$$
r _ {t} = - \log \delta - \log \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ 1 / c _ {t + 1} ] - \kappa_ {c} + \frac {\left((1 - \alpha) \bar {s} + \alpha A ^ {*} \bar {c}\right)}{\bar {c} \left(A A ^ {*} \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} \left(A + A ^ {*}\right)\right)} s _ {t} + \frac {(1 - \alpha) \left(A \bar {c} + \bar {s}\right)}{\bar {c} \left(A A ^ {*} \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} \left(A + A ^ {*}\right)\right)} s _ {t} ^ {*}
$$

The log real exchange rate  $-e_t = \log c_t - \log c_t^*$ . The log price level is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log P _ {t} = \log Q _ {t} - \log \left(s _ {t} + c _ {t} A\right) \\ \approx \log Q _ {t} - \log (\bar {s} + \bar {c} A) - \frac {1}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} (s _ {t} - \bar {s}) - \frac {\bar {c} A}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} \left(\kappa - \frac {\left((1 - \alpha) \bar {s} + \alpha A ^ {*} \bar {c}\right) s _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) (A \bar {c} + \bar {s}) s _ {t} ^ {*}}{\bar {c} (A A ^ {*} \bar {c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} (A + A ^ {*}))} - \log \bar {c}\right) \\ = \kappa^ {P} + \log Q _ {t} - \frac {1 - \alpha}{\bar {s} + \bar {c c} A} \frac {A ^ {*} \bar {c c} + \bar {s} (A ^ {*} / A)}{A ^ {*} \bar {c c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} (1 + A ^ {*} / A)} s _ {t} + \frac {(1 - \alpha)}{A ^ {*} \bar {c c} + (1 - \alpha) \bar {s} (1 + A ^ {*} / A)} s _ {t} ^ {*} \\ \end{array}
$$

where

$$
\kappa^ {P} = - \log (\bar {s} + \bar {c} A) - \frac {1}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} (- \bar {s}) - \frac {\bar {c} A}{\bar {s} + \bar {c} A} (\kappa - \log \bar {c}).
$$

Setting  $A = A^{*}$  yields the expressions in the proposition.

# A.28 Proposition 7.1 in Section 7.A

Proof. Divide the first condition by the third, and the second by the fourth to get:

$$
\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t} ^ {*}}{c _ {H , t} ^ {*}} = \frac {\mu_ {H , t}}{\mu_ {F . t}} \stackrel {\mathrm {d e f}} {=} \exp (t o t _ {t})
$$

plugging in  $\exp(tot_t)$  into the aggregation rule of home and foreign goods yields:

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {t} = \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} c _ {H, t} = \left(\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \exp (- t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {\alpha} c _ {F, t} \\ c _ {t} ^ {*} = \left(\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {\alpha} c _ {H, t} ^ {*} = \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (- t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {1 - \alpha} c _ {F, t} ^ {*} \\ \end{array}
$$

then, plug in the equations above into the market clearing conditions to get the consumption rule

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {\alpha - 1} c _ {t} + \left(\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \exp (t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {- \alpha} c _ {t} ^ {*} = y _ {t} \\ \left(\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \exp (- t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {- \alpha} c _ {t} + \left(\frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \exp (- t o t _ {t})\right) ^ {\alpha - 1} c _ {t} ^ {*} = y _ {t} ^ {*} \\ \end{array}
$$

Note that we have shown in Section 1.A that:

$$
\frac {\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \frac {c _ {F , t}}{c _ {H , t}} = \frac {p _ {t}}{p _ {t} ^ {*} \exp (- e _ {t})}
$$

which implies that  $\exp (tot_{t})$  is actually the relative price between two goods. Dividing the first condition by the second one to pin down the expression of  $\exp (tot_{t})$ :

$$
\frac {\pi}{1 - \pi} \frac {\left(c _ {t}\right) ^ {- \gamma}}{\left(c _ {t} ^ {*}\right) ^ {- \gamma^ {*}}} \exp (t o t _ {t}) ^ {1 - 2 \alpha} = 1
$$

# A.29 Proposition 7.2 in Section 7.C

Proof. Linearize the Euler equation to get

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (- \bar {\lambda} _ {H, t}) (- \lambda_ {H, t} + \bar {\lambda} _ {H} + 1) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta \left(\frac {\bar {c}}{\bar {c}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \exp (\bar {r}) (1 - \gamma \Delta \log c _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} - \bar {r}) \right] \\ \Rightarrow - \lambda_ {H, t} + \bar {\lambda} _ {H} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ - \gamma \Delta \log c _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} - \bar {r} \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $-\bar{\lambda}_H = \log \delta +\bar{r}$  , which implies

$$
- \lambda_ {H, t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ - \gamma \Delta \log c _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} + \log \delta ].
$$

Similarly,

$$
- \lambda_ {H, t} ^ {*} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ - \gamma \Delta \log c _ {t + 1} ^ {*} + \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} + \log \delta \right],
$$

which implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} - \left(\lambda_ {H, t} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - m _ {t + 1} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \gamma \left(\Delta \log c _ {t + 1} - \Delta \log c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} \right] \\ \Rightarrow e _ {t} = \left(\lambda_ {H, t} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t}\right) + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \gamma \left(\Delta \log c _ {t + 1} - \Delta \log c _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) \right] + e _ {t + 1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Iterate forward to get

$$
e _ {t} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \left(\lambda_ {H, t + j} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t + j}\right) + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \gamma \left(\Delta \log c _ {t + j + 1} - \Delta \log c _ {t + j + 1} ^ {*}\right)\right] + \lim  _ {j \rightarrow \infty} e _ {t + j + 1}.
$$

Let  $\lim_{j\to \infty}e_{t + j + 1} = \bar{e}$ . Plugging  $\Delta c_{t + 1} = \log c_{t + 1} - \log c_t$  yields

$$
\begin{array}{l} e _ {t} - \bar {e} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \left(\lambda_ {H, t + j} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t + j}\right) + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \gamma \left(\log c _ {t + j + 1} - \log c _ {t + j} - \log c _ {t + j + 1} ^ {*} + \log c _ {t + j} ^ {*}\right) \right] \\ = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} (\lambda_ {H, t + j} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {H, t + j}) - \gamma (\log c _ {t} - \log c _ {t} ^ {*}) + \gamma (\log \bar {c} - \log \bar {c} ^ {*}) \\ \end{array}
$$

where we let  $\bar{c} = \lim_{j\to \infty}c_{t + j + 1},\bar{c}^{*} = \lim_{j\to \infty}c_{t + j + 1}^{*}$ . This yields Eq.

(7.4). Finally, recall that

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {H, t} ^ {*}) = 1 - \frac {\omega_ {H} ^ {*} (b _ {H , t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \sigma} - (\bar {c} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma} \theta_ {H , t} ^ {*}}{(c _ {t} ^ {*}) ^ {- \gamma}} \exp (- e _ {t})
$$

$$
\exp (- \lambda_ {H, t}) = 1 - \frac {\omega_ {H} (b _ {H , t}) ^ {- \sigma}}{c _ {t} ^ {- \gamma}}
$$

Plug in  $\exp(-\lambda_{H,t}) \approx 1 - \lambda_{H,t}$  and  $\exp(-\lambda_{H,t}^{*}) \approx 1 - \lambda_{H,t}^{*}$  yields Eq.

(7.5).

# A.30 Proposition 8.1 in Section 8.A

Proof. Rearrange Eq. (8.1) to get:

$$
D _ {t} = - S _ {t} + D _ {t - 1} \exp \left(R _ {t} ^ {D}\right)
$$

iterate backwards to get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} D _ {t} = - S _ {t} + \left(- S _ {t - 1} + D _ {t - 2} \exp \left(R _ {t - 1} ^ {D}\right)\right) \exp \left(R _ {t} ^ {D}\right) \\ = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {1} S _ {t - j} \exp \left(R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) + D _ {t - 2} \exp \left(R _ {t - 2 \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) \\ = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {1} S _ {t - j} \exp \left(R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) - S _ {t - 2} \exp \left(R _ {t - 2 \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) + D _ {t - 3} \exp \left(R _ {t - 2} ^ {D}\right) \exp \left(R _ {t - 2 \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) \\ = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {2} S _ {t - j} \exp \left(R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) + D _ {t - 3} \exp \left(R _ {t - 3 \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

similarly,

$$
D _ {t} = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {k} S _ {t - j} \exp \left(R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) + D _ {t - k - 1} \exp \left(R _ {t - k - 1 \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right)
$$

where  $R_{t - j\rightarrow t}^{D} = R_{t}^{D} + R_{t - 1}^{D} + \dots +R_{t - j + 1}^{D}$  and  $R_{t\to t}^{D} = 0$ . Let  $k = t - 1$

to get Eq. (8.2):

$$
D _ {t} = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {t - 1} S _ {t - j} \exp \left(R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right) + D _ {0} \exp \left(R _ {0 \rightarrow t} ^ {D}\right)
$$

Divide both sides by  $Y_{t}$  to get Eq. (8.3):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {D _ {t}}{Y _ {t}} = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {t - 1} \frac {S _ {t - j}}{Y _ {t}} \exp (R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D}) + \frac {D _ {0}}{Y _ {t}} \exp (R _ {0 \rightarrow t} ^ {D}) \\ \Rightarrow \frac {D _ {t}}{Y _ {t}} = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {t - 1} \frac {S _ {t - j}}{Y _ {t - j}} \frac {Y _ {t - j}}{Y _ {t}} \exp (R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D}) + \frac {D _ {0}}{Y _ {0}} \frac {Y _ {0}}{Y _ {t}} \exp (R _ {0 \rightarrow t} ^ {D}) \\ = - \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {t - 1} \frac {S _ {t - j}}{Y _ {t - j}} \exp \left(R _ {t - j \rightarrow t} ^ {D} - X _ {t - j \rightarrow t}\right) + \frac {D _ {0}}{Y _ {0}} \exp \left(R _ {0 \rightarrow t} ^ {D} - X _ {0 \rightarrow t}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\exp (X_{t - j\rightarrow t}) = Y_t / Y_{t - j}$

# A.31 Proposition 8.2 in Section 8.B

Proof. First, let us assume that the government never defaults. Consider the time  $t + 1$  constraints,

$$
\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h - 1) = S _ {t + 1} + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h)
$$

multiply both sides by nominal SDF  $\exp (M_{t + 1})$  and take expectations conditional on time  $t$ :

$$
\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1}\right) S _ {t + 1} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h) \right] \tag {A.36}
$$

where we use the asset pricing equations  $\mathbb{E}_t[\exp (M_{t + 1})] = P_t(1)$ , and  $\mathbb{E}_t[\exp (M_{t + 1})P_{t + 1}(h - 1)] = P_t(h)$ .

Similarly, the time  $t + 2$  constraints imply:

$$
\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1, t + 2}\right) S _ {t + 2} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1, t + 2}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 2} (h) P _ {t + 2} (h) \right]
$$

Plug in Eq. (A.36) to get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t + 1}) S _ {t + 1} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t + 1}) \exp (M _ {t + 1, t + 2}) S _ {t + 2} \right] \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t + 1}) \exp (M _ {t + 1, t + 2}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 2} (h) P _ {t + 2} (h) \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {2} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) S _ {t, t + k} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t, t + 2}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 2} (h) P _ {t + 2} (h) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

iterate forward to time  $t + n$  to get:

$$
\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) S _ {t, t + k} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + n}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + n} (h) P _ {t + n} (h) \right] \tag {A.37}
$$

More specifically, assume that the equation above is true for  $n = \ell$ .

For  $n = \ell + 1$ , the constraints in time  $t + \ell + 1$  imply:

$$
\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + \ell} (h) P _ {t + \ell} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t + \ell} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + \ell , t + \ell + 1}\right) S _ {t + \ell + 1} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t + \ell} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + \ell , t + \ell + 1}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + \ell + 1} (h) P _ {t + \ell + 1} (h) \right]
$$

it's easy to show that the expression is also true for  $n = \ell + 1$  by plugging the equation above in Eq. (A.37) (while letting  $n = \ell$ ). Let  $n \to \infty$  and plug in budget constraint Eq. (8.5) to get Eq. (8.6).

Now, consider the case of default. We consider only full default, without loss of generality. In case of default at  $t$ , the one-period budget constraint is given by:

$$
0 = S _ {t} + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h)
$$

We use  $\chi_t$  as an indicator for default. The budget constraints now become:

$$
\left(1 - \chi_ {t}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t - 1} (h) P _ {t} (h - 1) = S _ {t} + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h)
$$

Consider the time  $t + 1$  constraint,

$$
(1 - \chi_ {t + 1}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h - 1) = S _ {t + 1} + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h)
$$

multiply both sides by nominal SDF  $\exp (M_{t + 1})$  and take expectations conditional on time  $t$ :

$$
\sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1}\right) S _ {t + 1} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h) \right]
$$

where we use the asset pricing equations  $\mathbb{E}_t[\exp (M_{t + 1})(1 - \chi_{t + 1})] = P_t(1)$ , and  $\mathbb{E}_t[\exp (M_{t + 1})P_{t + 1}(h - 1)(1 - \chi_{t + 1})] = P_t(h)$ .

Again, we reach the condition in Eq. (A.36). Iterate forward the same way in no default case to time  $n \to \infty$  and we will get Eq. (8.6) as long as the government does not default in time  $t$ . Since bond payment is not certain any more, the money that government can raise from  $1\%$  face value of bond drops  $(P_{t}$  decrease).

# A.32 Proposition 8.3 in Section 8.B

Proof. We present the proof for general case with default. Consider the time  $t + 1$  constraint,

$$
(1 - \chi_ {t + 1}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h - 1) = S _ {t + 1} + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h)
$$

multiply both sides by nominal SDF  $\exp (M_{t + 1})$  and take expectations conditional on time  $t$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) e ^ {- \lambda_ {t} (h)} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1}\right) S _ {t + 1} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h) \right] \\ \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t + 1}) S _ {t + 1} ] + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) \left(1 - e ^ {- \lambda_ {t} (h)}\right) \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h) \right] \tag {A.38} \\ \end{array}
$$

where we use the asset pricing equations  $\mathbb{E}_t[\exp (M_{t + 1})(1 - \chi_{t + 1})] = P_t(1)e^{-\lambda_t(1)}$ , and  $\mathbb{E}_t[\exp (M_{t + 1})P_{t + 1}(h - 1)(1 - \chi_{t + 1})] = P_t(h)e^{-\lambda_t(h)}$ .

Similarly, consider the time  $t + 2$  budget constraint. Multiply both sides by nominal SDF  $\exp (M_{t + 1,t + 2})$  and take expectations conditional on time  $t + 1$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + 1, t + 2}\right) S _ {t + 2} \right] + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 1} (h) P _ {t + 1} (h) \left(1 - e ^ {- \lambda_ {t + 1} (h)}\right) \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {t + 1} \left[ \exp (M _ {t + 1, t + 2}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 2} (h) P _ {t + 2} (h) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

plug it into the RHS of Eq. (A.38) to get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {2} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) S _ {t + k} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {1} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + k} (h) P _ {t + k} (h) \left(1 - e ^ {- \lambda_ {t + k} (h)}\right) \right] \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + 2}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + 2} (h) P _ {t + 2} (h) \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

To iterate forward, assume that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) S _ {t + k} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {n - 1} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + k} (h) P _ {t + k} (h) \left(1 - e ^ {- \lambda_ {t + k} (h)}\right) \right] \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + n}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + n} (h) P _ {t + n} (h) \right] \tag {A.39} \\ \end{array}
$$

is true for  $n = \ell$ . For  $n = \ell + 1$ , consider the time  $t + \ell + 1$  budget constraint. Similarly, multiply both sides by nominal S  $\exp(M_{t + \ell, t + \ell + 1})$  and take expectations conditional on time  $t +$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + \ell} (h) P _ {t + \ell} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t + \ell} [ \exp (M _ {t + \ell , t + \ell + 1}) S _ {t + \ell + 1} ] + \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + \ell} (h) P _ {t + \ell} (h) \left(1 - e ^ {- \lambda_ {t + \ell} (h)}\right) \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {t + \ell} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t + \ell , t + \ell + 1}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + \ell + 1} (h) P _ {t + \ell + 1} (h) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

plug it into the RHS of Eq. (A.39) to get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\ell} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) S _ {t + k} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\ell - 1} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + k} (h) P _ {t + k} (h) \left(1 - e ^ {- \lambda_ {t + k} (h)}\right) \right] \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t, t + \ell}) \mathbb {E} _ {t + \ell} \left[ \exp (M _ {t + \ell , t + \ell + 1}) S _ {t + \ell + 1} \right] \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t, t + \ell}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + \ell} (h) P _ {t + \ell} (h) \left(1 - e ^ {- \lambda_ {t + \ell} (h)}\right) \right] \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t, t + \ell}) \mathbb {E} _ {t + \ell} \left[ \exp (M _ {t + \ell , t + \ell + 1}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + \ell + 1} (h) P _ {t + \ell + 1} (h) \right] \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Rearrange the RHS to get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t} (h) P _ {t} (h) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\ell + 1} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) S _ {t + k} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\ell} \exp \left(M _ {t, t + k}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + k} (h) P _ {t + k} (h) \left(1 - e ^ {- \lambda_ {t + k} (h)}\right) \right] \\ + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp \left(M _ {t, t + \ell + 1}\right) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + \ell + 1} (h) P _ {t + \ell + 1} (h) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Hence, we can iterate the equation from  $n = \ell$  to  $n = \ell + 1$  for any  $\ell \geq 1$  and prove Eq. (A.39). Recall the time  $t$  budget condition when default does not happen in Eq. (8.5). Plugging  $\sum_{h=1}^{H} Q_t(h) P_t(h)$  into the RHS and letting  $n \to \infty$  yields the result:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t - 1} (h) P _ {t} (h - 1) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) S _ {t + k} \right] + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + k} (h) P _ {t + k} (h) (1 - e ^ {- \lambda_ {t + k} (h)}) \right] \\ + \lim  _ {k \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \exp (M _ {t, t + k}) \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {H} Q _ {t + k} (h) P _ {t + k} (h) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

note that we replace letter  $n$  to  $k$  for simplicity.

# A.33 Proposition 8.4 in Section 8.B

Proof. By the definition of  $\exp(R_{t+1}^D)$ ,  $\exp(R_{t+1}^T)$  and  $\exp(R_{t+1}^G)$ :

$$
P _ {t} ^ {T} \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {T}) - P _ {t} ^ {G} \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {G}) = P _ {t + 1} ^ {T} + T _ {t + 1} - P _ {t + 1} ^ {G} - G _ {t + 1} = D _ {t} \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {D})
$$

Divide both sides by  $D_{t}$  and take expectations to get part (a). Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{l} D _ {t} \beta_ {t} ^ {D} = \frac {\operatorname {c o v} _ {t} \left(D _ {t} \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}\right) , \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right)\right)}{\operatorname {v a r} _ {t} \left(\exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right) - \exp \left(R _ {t}\right)\right)} \\ = \frac {c o v _ {t} \left(P _ {t + 1} ^ {T} + T _ {t + 1} - P _ {t + 1} ^ {G} - G _ {t + 1} , \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right)\right)}{v a r _ {t} \left(\exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right) - \exp \left(R _ {t}\right)\right)} \\ = \frac {c o v _ {t} \left(P _ {t} ^ {T} \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {T}\right) - P _ {t} ^ {G} \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {G}\right) , \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right)\right)}{v a r _ {t} \left(\exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right) - \exp \left(R _ {t}\right)\right)} \\ = P _ {t} ^ {T} \beta_ {t} ^ {T} - P _ {t} ^ {G} \beta_ {t} ^ {G} \\ \end{array}
$$

Again, divide both sides by  $D_{t}$  to get part (b).

# A.34 Proposition 8.5 in Section 8.B

Proof. Multiply both sides of Eq. (8.12) by  $D_t / (P_t^T + P_t^K - P_t^G)$  and plug in  $D_t = P_t^T + P_t^K + K_t - P_t^G$  to obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {D}) \left(1 + \frac {K _ {t}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}}\right) \\ = \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {T}) \frac {P _ {t} ^ {T}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} + \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {K}) \frac {P _ {t} ^ {K}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} - \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {G}) \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Taking conditional expectation  $\mathbb{E}_t$  for both sides yields part (a). To get part (b), take conditional covariance with market return  $\exp(R_{t+1}^M)$  and divide by its variance for both sides

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {c o v _ {t} \left(\exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {D} , \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right)\right)\right)}{v a r _ {t} \left(\exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right)\right)} \left(1 + \frac {K _ {t}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}}\right) \\ = \frac {c o v _ {t} \left(\exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {T} , \exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right)\right)\right)}{v a r _ {t} \left(\exp \left(R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}\right)\right)} \frac {P _ {t} ^ {T}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \\ + \frac {c o v _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {K} , \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M})))}{v a r _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}))} \frac {P _ {t} ^ {K}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} \\ - \frac {c o v _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {G} , \exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M})))}{v a r _ {t} (\exp (R _ {t + 1} ^ {M}))} \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}}, \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies

$$
\beta_ {t} ^ {D} \left(1 + \frac {K _ {t}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}}\right) = \beta_ {t} ^ {T} \frac {P _ {t} ^ {T}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} + \beta_ {t} ^ {K} \frac {P _ {t} ^ {K}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}} - \beta_ {t} ^ {G} \frac {P _ {t} ^ {G}}{P _ {t} ^ {T} + P _ {t} ^ {K} - P _ {t} ^ {G}},

# A.35 Proposition 8.6 in Section 8.C

We will use the Envelope theorem as a lemma.

Lemma A.1.  $\psi^{\prime}(w_{t},t) = \delta^{t}u^{\prime}(c_{t})$

Proof. Let  $\left(\{c_{s}\}_{s=t}^{\infty},\{d_{s}\}_{s=t}^{\infty}\right)$  be the optimal solution from  $w_{t}$ . Let  $\Delta w > 0$ , define a feasible process  $\left(\{c_{s}^{*}\}_{s=t},\{d_{s}^{*}\}_{s=t}\right)$  from  $w_{t} + \Delta w$ , such that  $c_{t}^{*} = c_{t} + \Delta w, d_{t}^{*} = d_{t}, c_{s}^{*} = c_{s}, d_{s}^{*} = d_{s}, s = t+1,t+2,\ldots$ . It is clear that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \psi (w _ {t} + \Delta w, t) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {s} u \left(c _ {s} ^ {*}\right) \right] \\ \Rightarrow \psi (w _ {t} + \Delta w, t) - \psi (w _ {t}, t) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {s} u \left(c _ {s} ^ {*}\right) \right] - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {s} u \left(c _ {s}\right) \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta^ {t} u \left(c _ {t} + \Delta w\right) - \delta^ {t} u \left(c _ {t}\right) \right] \\ = \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) \Delta w + o (\Delta w) \\ \end{array}
$$

Hence,

$$
\lim  _ {\Delta w \rightarrow 0} \frac {\psi (w _ {t} + \Delta w , t) - \psi (w _ {t} , t)}{\Delta w} \geq \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})
$$

This implies that  $\psi'(w_t, t) \geq \delta^t u'(c_t)$ . Now, take  $\Delta w$  sufficiently small such that  $0 < \Delta w < c_t$ . Define a feasible process  $(\{c_s^*\}_{s=t}^\infty, \{d_s^*\}_{s=t}^\infty)$  from  $w_t - \Delta w$ , such that  $c_t^* = c_t - \Delta w$ ,  $d_t^* = d_t$ ,  $c_s^* = c_s$ ,  $d_s^* = d_s$ ,  $s = t + 1, t + 2, \ldots$ . Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \psi (w _ {t} - \Delta w, t) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {s} u \left(c _ {s} ^ {*}\right) \right] \\ \Rightarrow \psi (w _ {t} - \Delta w, t) - \psi (w _ {t}, t) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {s} u (c _ {s} ^ {*}) \right] - \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {s} u (c _ {s}) \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta^ {t} u \left(c _ {t} - \Delta w\right) - \delta^ {t} u \left(c _ {t}\right) \right] \\ = \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) (- \Delta w) + o (\Delta w) \\ \end{array}
$$

Hence,

$$
\lim  _ {\Delta w \rightarrow 0} \frac {\psi (w _ {t} - \Delta w , t) - \psi (w _ {t} , t)}{- \Delta w} \leq \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})
$$

This implies that  $\psi'(w_t, t) \leq \delta^t u'(c_t)$ , hence  $\psi'(w_t, t) = \delta^t u'(c_t)$ .

Proof. First, we prove the necessity of the transversality condition. Since  $\psi(w_t, t)$  is differentiable at  $w_t$ , by the concavity of  $u(c)$ ,

$$
\psi \left(w _ {t}, t\right) \geq \psi \left(w _ {t}, t\right) - \psi \left(w _ {t} / 2, t\right) \geq \psi^ {\prime} \left(w _ {t}, t\right) w _ {t} / 2.
$$

By Envelope theorem, i.e.,  $\psi'(w_t, t) = \delta^t u'(c_t)$ , then the assumptions  $\lim_{t \to \infty} \psi(w_t, t) = 0$  and  $u'(c_t) \geq 0$  implies

$$
\lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) w _ {t} \right] = 0
$$

$$
\lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)\left(y _ {t} + d _ {t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {d}\right)\right)\right] = 0.
$$

Since  $y_{t}, u^{\prime}(c_{t}) \geq 0$ , and by the short-sale constraint,  $d_{t-1} \geq 0$  then,

$$
0 \leq \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) d _ {t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {d}\right) \right] \leq \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) \left(y _ {t} + d _ {t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {d}\right)\right) \right]
$$

$$
0 \leq \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) d _ {t - 1} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {d}) \right] \leq \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) \left(y _ {t} + d _ {t - 1} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {d})\right)\right] = 0
$$

$$
\lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) d _ {t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {d}\right)\right] = 0
$$

Lastly, by the Euler equation (8.13),

$$
u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t - 1}\right) d _ {t - 1} = \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \delta u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) d _ {t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {d}\right) \right]
$$

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t - 1}) d _ {t - 1} \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) d _ {t - 1} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {d}) \right].
$$

then

$$
0 = \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) d _ {t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {d}\right)\right] = \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t - 1} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t - 1}\right) d _ {t - 1} \right],
$$

which implies the transversality condition.

# A.36 Proposition 8.7 in Section 8.C

Proof. First, We derive the Euler equation with utility from holding the bonds. The Lagrangian is:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {t} (u (c _ {t}) + v _ {t} (d _ {t})) + \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \zeta_ {t} (y _ {t} + d _ {t - 1} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {D}) - c _ {t} - d _ {t}) \right]
$$

The first order conditions are given by

$$
\delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) - \zeta_ {t} = 0
$$

$$
\delta^ {t} v _ {t} ^ {\prime} (d _ {t}) - \zeta_ {t} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \zeta_ {t + 1} \exp (r _ {t + 1} ^ {D}) ] = 0
$$

which imply the Euler equation

$$
v _ {t} ^ {\prime} (d _ {t}) - u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) + \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \delta u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t + 1}) \exp (r _ {t + 1} ^ {D}) ] = 0
$$

hence,

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \frac {\delta u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t + 1}\right)}{u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)} \exp \left(r _ {t + 1} ^ {D}\right) \right] = 1 - \frac {v _ {t} ^ {\prime} \left(d _ {t}\right)}{u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)}
$$

we denote the RHS as  $\exp(-\lambda_t)$ . Similarly, we define the households' value function as

$$
\psi (w _ {t}, t) = \max \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \sum_ {s = t} ^ {\infty} \delta^ {s} \left(u (c _ {s}) + v _ {t} (d _ {t})\right) \right]
$$

we can show in the same way in lemma A.1 that

$$
\psi^ {\prime} (w _ {t}, t) = \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t})
$$

by the concavity of  $\psi(w_t, t)$  and that  $\lim_{t \to \infty} \psi(w_t, t) = 0$ :

$$
0 \leq \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \psi^ {\prime} (w _ {t}, t) \frac {w _ {t}}{2} \leq \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} (\psi (w _ {t}, t) - \psi (w _ {t} / 2, t)) \leq \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \psi (w _ {t}, t) = 0
$$

hence,

$$
\lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) w _ {t} \right] = 0
$$

$$
\lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right)\left(y _ {t} + d _ {t - 1} \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {D}\right)\right)\right] = 0
$$

since  $y_{t}, d_{t}, u^{\prime}(c_{t})$  are all non-negative, plugging in the Euler equation to get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \lim _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} [ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} (c _ {t}) d _ {t - 1} \exp (r _ {t} ^ {D}) ] = 0 \\ \Rightarrow \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t - 1} d _ {t - 1} \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} \left[ \delta u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) \exp \left(r _ {t} ^ {D}\right)\right]\right] = 0 \\ \Rightarrow \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t - 1} d _ {t - 1} \left(u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t - 1}\right) - v _ {t} ^ {\prime} \left(d _ {t - 1}\right)\right)\right] = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

replacing time subscripts to  $t$  to get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} \left(u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) - v _ {t} ^ {\prime} \left(d _ {t}\right)\right) d _ {t} \right] = 0 \\ \Rightarrow \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) d _ {t} \exp (- \lambda_ {t}) \right] = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

the expression of  $\exp (-\lambda_t)$  is given above.

To obtain the original transversality condition, assume that  $\lambda_{t}$  is bounded above by  $\bar{\lambda}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) d _ {t} \right] = \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) d _ {t} \exp (- \lambda_ {t}) \exp (\lambda_ {t}) \right] \\ \leq \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) d _ {t} \exp \left(- \lambda_ {t}\right) \exp (\bar {\lambda}) \right] \\ = \exp (\bar {\lambda}) \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {0} \left[ \delta^ {t} u ^ {\prime} \left(c _ {t}\right) d _ {t} \exp (- \lambda_ {t}) \right] \\ = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

# A.37 Proposition 8.8 in Section 8.E

Proof. (a) Conjecture the log price of the nominal bond is

$$
\log P _ {t} (h) = A (h) + B (h) ^ {\prime} z _ {t}.
$$

The Euler equation implies

$$
\exp (\log P _ {t - 1} (h + 1)) = \mathbb {E} _ {t - 1} [ \exp (M _ {t} + \log P _ {t} (h)) ]
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} A (h + 1) + B (h + 1) ^ {\prime} z _ {t - 1} = - i _ {t - 1} (1) - \frac {1}{2} \Lambda_ {t - 1} ^ {\prime} \Lambda_ {t - 1} + A (h) + B (h) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t - 1} \\ + \frac {1}{2} \Lambda_ {t - 1} ^ {\prime} \Lambda_ {t - 1} + \frac {1}{2} B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma B (h) - B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {t - 1} \\ = - i _ {0} (1) + A (h) + \frac {1}{2} B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma B (h) - B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} \\ + \left(- e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + B (h) ^ {\prime} \Psi - B ^ {\prime} (h) \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right) z _ {t - 1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Compare coefficients to obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} A (h + 1) = - i _ {0} (1) + A (h) + \frac {1}{2} B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma B (h) - B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0}, \\ B (h + 1) ^ {\prime} = B (h) ^ {\prime} \Psi - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} - B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}, \\ \end{array}
$$

with the initial condition given by  $A(0) = 0$  and  $B(0) = \vec{0}$ .

(b) Denote the time  $t$  log price-dividend ratio on the stock dividend strip that pays  $Div_{t + h}$  at time  $t + h$  as  $pd_t^m (h)$ . The Euler equation is

$$
\exp (p d _ {t - 1} ^ {m} (h + 1)) = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \exp (M _ {t} + p d _ {t} ^ {m} (h) + \Delta \log D i v _ {t}) ],
$$

where  $\Delta \log Div_t = \Delta \log d_t + x_t + \pi_t$ , i.e., the log nominal dividend growth is the sum of the log growth of dividend-GDP ratio, log growth of real GDP and inflation. Conjecture that

$$
p d _ {t} ^ {m} (h) = A ^ {m} (h) + B ^ {m} (h) ^ {\prime} z _ {t}.
$$

Plug  $\Delta \log Div_{t}$  into the Euler equation to obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} A ^ {m} (h + 1) + B ^ {m} (h + 1) ^ {\prime} z _ {t - 1} = - i _ {t - 1} (1) - \frac {1}{2} \Lambda_ {t} ^ {\prime} \Lambda_ {t} + A ^ {m} (h) + B ^ {m} (h) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t - 1} + x _ {0} + \pi_ {0} + (e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t - 1} \\ + \frac {1}{2} \Lambda_ {t} ^ {\prime} \Lambda_ {t} + \frac {1}{2} (B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} \Sigma (B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) \\ - \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {t} \\ = - i _ {0} (1) + A ^ {m} (h) + x _ {0} + \pi_ {0} + \frac {1}{2} \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) \\ - \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} \\ + \left(- e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Psi - \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right) z _ {t - 1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

By matching coefficients, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} A ^ {m} (h + 1) = - i _ {0} (1) + A ^ {m} (h) + x _ {0} + \pi_ {0} + \frac {1}{2} (B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} \Sigma (B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) \\ - \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0}, \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
B ^ {m} (h + 1) ^ {\prime} = - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Psi - \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}.
$$

with initial condition  $A^m (0) = 0$ ,  $B^{m}(0) = 0$

(c) The derivation is very similar to that in (b).

# A.38 Proposition 8.9 in Section 8.E

Proof. (a) Recall that

$$
A (h + 1) = - i _ {0} (1) + A (h) + \frac {1}{2} B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma B (h) - B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0},
$$

$$
B (h + 1) ^ {\prime} = B (h) ^ {\prime} \Psi - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} - B (h) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1},
$$

which further implies

$$
B (h) ^ {\prime} = - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} \left(I - \left(\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right)\right) ^ {- 1} \left(I - \left(\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right) ^ {h}\right)
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \lim _ {h \to \infty} A (h) / h = - i _ {0} (1) + \frac {1}{2} B (\infty) ^ {\prime} \Sigma B (\infty) - B (\infty) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0}, \\ B (\infty) ^ {\prime} = \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} B (h) ^ {\prime} = - e _ {i} ^ {\prime} \left(I - \left(\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right)\right) ^ {- 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

The expected return of holding the long-term bond from time  $t$  to

$t + 1$  is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \log P _ {t + 1} (h - 1) - \log P _ {t} (h) \right] = A (h - 1) + B (h - 1) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t} - A (h) - B (h) ^ {\prime} z _ {t} \\ = i _ {0} (1) - \frac {1}{2} B (h - 1) ^ {\prime} \Sigma B (h - 1) + B (h - 1) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} \\ + B (h - 1) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t} - B (h) ^ {\prime} z _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Letting  $h\to \infty$  yields

$$
\begin{array}{l} \lim _ {h \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \log P _ {t + 1} (h - 1) - \log P _ {t} (h) ] = i _ {0} (1) - \frac {1}{2} B (\infty) ^ {\prime} \Sigma B (\infty) + B (\infty) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} + B (\infty) ^ {\prime} (\Psi - I) z _ {t}, \\ \lim  _ {h \rightarrow \infty} i _ {t} (h) = i _ {0} (1) - \frac {1}{2} B (\infty) ^ {\prime} \Sigma B (\infty) + B (\infty) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0}. \\ \end{array}
$$

(b) Recall that

$$
\begin{array}{l} A ^ {m} (h + 1) = - i _ {0} (1) + A ^ {m} (h) + x _ {0} + \pi_ {0} + \frac {1}{2} (B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} \Sigma (B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) \\ - \left(B ^ {m} (h) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0}, \\ \end{array}
$$

$$

$$

Note that  $\log P_t^m (h) = pd_t^m (h) + \log Div_t$ . Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \log P _ {t + 1} ^ {m} (h - 1) - \log P _ {t} ^ {m} (h) \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ p d _ {t + 1} ^ {m} (h - 1) - p d _ {t} ^ {m} (h) + \log D i v _ {t + 1} - \log D i v _ {t} \right] \\ = A ^ {m} (h - 1) + B ^ {m} (h - 1) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t} - A ^ {m} (h) - B ^ {m} (h) ^ {\prime} z _ {t} + \left(e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t} \\ = i _ {0} (1) - \frac {1}{2} \left(B ^ {m} (h - 1) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma \left(B ^ {m} (h - 1) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) \\ + (B ^ {m} (h - 1) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} + B ^ {m} (h - 1) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t} - B ^ {m} (h) ^ {\prime} z _ {t} + (e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Let  $h\to \infty$  to obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} \lim _ {h \to \infty} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \log P _ {t + 1} ^ {m} (h - 1) - \log P _ {t} ^ {m} (h) \right] \\ = i _ {0} (1) - \frac {1}{2} \left(B ^ {m} (\infty) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma \left(B ^ {m} (\infty) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) \\ + \left(B ^ {m} (\infty) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {0} + B ^ {m} (\infty) ^ {\prime} (\Psi - I) z _ {t} + \left(e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \Psi z _ {t}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $B^{m}(\infty)^{\prime}$  is given by

$$
B ^ {m} (\infty) ^ {\prime} = \left(- e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + (e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} (\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1})\right) \left(I - (\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1})\right) ^ {- 1},
$$

from which we can further simplify  $(B^{m}(\infty) + e_{\Delta d} + e_{x} + e_{\pi})'$  to

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(B ^ {m} (\infty) + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} = B ^ {m} (\infty) ^ {\prime} + \left(e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} (I - \left(\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right)) \left(I - \left(\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right)\right) ^ {- 1} \\ = \left(- e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + (e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) ^ {\prime} (\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}) + (e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}) (I - (\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}))\right) (I - (\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1})) ^ {- 1} \\ = \left(- e _ {i} ^ {\prime} + e _ {\Delta d} + e _ {x} + e _ {\pi}\right) ^ {\prime} \left(I - \left(\Psi - \Sigma^ {\frac {1}{2}} \Lambda_ {1}\right)\right) ^ {- 1}. \\ \end{array}

t b _ {t} = a _ {t} - \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t} (\iota) - a _ {t - 1} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) (1 + d _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota) + \rho_ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)) + a _ {t - 1} ^ {*} \sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} ^ {*} (1 + d _ {t} (\iota) + \rho_ {t} (\iota)).
$$

Recall the dynamics of home household wealth given by Eq. (9.2):

$$
a _ {t} = a _ {t - 1} \left(\sum_ {\iota} x _ {H, t - 1} (\iota) \left(1 + d _ {t} (\iota) + \rho_ {t} (\iota)\right) + \sum_ {\iota} x _ {F, t - 1} (\iota) \left(1 + d _ {t} ^ {*} (\iota) + \rho_ {t} ^ {*} (\iota)\right)\right) + s _ {t}.
$$

Plug into the  $tb_{t}$  expression to get

$$
t b _ {t} = s _ {t} - \left(\sum_ {\iota} m _ {t} (\iota) - \sum_ {\iota} m _ {t - 1} (\iota) \left(1 + \rho_ {t} (\iota) + d _ {t} (\iota)\right)\right).

# A.40 Proposition 9.2 in Section 9.B

Proof. Conjecture that

$$
\psi_ {t} (w _ {t}, z _ {t}) = \delta^ {t} f _ {t} (z _ {t}) \frac {w _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma},
$$

note that households consume all their wealth in the last period, i.e.

$$
\psi_ {t} (w _ {t}, z _ {t}) = \delta^ {t} \frac {w _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma}
$$

which implies the boundary condition for  $f_{t}(z_{t})$ :

$$
f _ {T} (z _ {T}) = 1.
$$

Plug the conjectured expression of  $\psi_{t + 1}(w_{t + 1},z_{t + 1})$  into the recursive form of  $\psi_t(w_t,z_t)$  to get

$$
\begin{array}{l} \psi_ {t} \left(w _ {t}, z _ {t}\right) = \max  _ {c _ {t}, x _ {t}} \left\{\delta^ {t} \frac {c _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta^ {t + 1} f _ {t + 1} \left(z _ {t + 1}\right) \frac {w _ {t + 1} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \right] \right\} \\ = \max  _ {c _ {t}, x _ {t}} \left\{\delta^ {t} \frac {c _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \delta^ {t + 1} f _ {t + 1} \left(z _ {t + 1}\right) \frac {\left(\left(w _ {t} - c _ {t}\right) x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \exp \left(r _ {t + 1}\right)\right) ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \right] \right\} \\ = \max  _ {c _ {t}, x _ {t}} \left\{\delta^ {t} \frac {c _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} + \delta^ {t + 1} \left(w _ {t} - c _ {t}\right) ^ {1 - \gamma} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ f _ {t + 1} \left(z _ {t + 1}\right) \frac {\left(x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \exp \left(r _ {t + 1}\right)\right) ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \right] \right\} \\ = \delta^ {t} w _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma} \max  _ {w c _ {t}, x _ {t}} \left\{\frac {w c _ {t} ^ {\gamma - 1}}{1 - \gamma} + \delta \left(1 - \frac {1}{w c _ {t}}\right) ^ {1 - \gamma} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ f _ {t + 1} \left(z _ {t + 1}\right) \frac {\left(x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \exp \left(r _ {t + 1}\right)\right) ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \right] \right\} \\ \end{array}
$$

since  $\delta (1 - \frac{1}{wc_t})^{1 - \gamma}$  is always positive and  $x_{t}$  only enters into the expectation term in the objective function, the optimal portfolio can be solved for independently of the optimal consumption, i.e.

$$
x _ {t} = \arg \max  _ {x _ {t}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ f _ {t + 1} \left(z _ {t + 1}\right) \frac {\left(x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \exp \left(r _ {t + 1}\right)\right) ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \right]
$$

which gives Eq. (9.9). For now, denote

$$
g _ {t} \left(z _ {t}\right) = \max  _ {x _ {t}} \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ f _ {t + 1} \left(z _ {t + 1}\right) \frac {\left(x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \exp \left(r _ {t + 1}\right)\right) ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \right]
$$

such that  $1 = x_{t}^{\prime}1$ . Plug  $g_{t}(z_{t})$  back into  $\psi_t(w_t,z_t)$  to get

$$
\psi_ {t} \left(w _ {t}, z _ {t}\right) = \delta^ {t} w _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma} \max  _ {w c _ {t}} \left\{\frac {w c _ {t} ^ {\gamma - 1}}{1 - \gamma} + \delta \left(1 - \frac {1}{w c _ {t}}\right) ^ {1 - \gamma} g _ {t} \left(z _ {t}\right) \right\}
$$

the first order condition w.r.t.  $wc_{t}$  gives

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = - w c _ {t} ^ {\gamma - 2} + \delta (1 - \gamma) (1 - \frac {1}{w c _ {t}}) ^ {- \gamma} w c _ {t} ^ {- 2} g _ {t} (z _ {t}) \\ \Rightarrow 1 = \delta (1 - \gamma) \left(w c _ {t} - 1\right) ^ {- \gamma} g _ {t} \left(z _ {t}\right) \\ \Rightarrow w c _ {t} = 1 + \left(\delta (1 - \gamma) g _ {t} \left(z _ {t}\right)\right) ^ {1 / \gamma} \\ \end{array}
$$

Hence,  $wc_{t}$  depends only on  $t$  and  $z_{t}$  but  $w_{t}$ . Meanwhile, the first order conditions also show that

$$
g _ {t} (z _ {t}) = \frac {(w c _ {t} - 1) ^ {\gamma}}{\delta (1 - \gamma)}
$$

plug  $g_{t}(z_{t})$  back into the value function to get

$$
\begin{array}{l} \psi_ {t} \left(w _ {t}, z _ {t}\right) = \delta^ {t} w _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma} \left[ \frac {w c _ {t} ^ {\gamma - 1}}{1 - \gamma} + \delta \left(1 - \frac {1}{w c _ {t}}\right) ^ {1 - \gamma} \frac {\left(w c _ {t} - 1\right) ^ {\gamma}}{\delta (1 - \gamma)} \right] \\ = \delta^ {t} \frac {w _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \left[ w c _ {t} ^ {\gamma - 1} + w c _ {t} ^ {\gamma - 1} \left(w c _ {t} - 1\right) \right] \\ = \delta^ {t} \frac {w _ {t} ^ {1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma} w c _ {t} ^ {\gamma} \\ \end{array}
$$

which confirms our conjecture and implies that

$$
f _ {t} (z _ {t}) = w c _ {t} ^ {\gamma}
$$

note that  $f_{T}(z_{T}) = wc_{T} = 1$ , which fulfills the boundary condition.

# A.41 Proposition 9.3 in Section 9.B

Proof. When the asset returns are i.i.d., the optimal portfolio choice is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} x _ {t} = \arg \max  _ {x _ {t}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \exp \left((1 - \gamma) r _ {t + 1} ^ {p}\right) \right] \\ = \arg \max  _ {x _ {t}} \exp (\mathbb {E} \left[ (1 - \gamma) r _ {t + 1} ^ {p} \right] + \frac {1}{2} v a r ((1 - \gamma) r _ {t + 1} ^ {p})) \\ = \arg \max  _ {x _ {t}} \mathbb {E} \left[ (1 - \gamma) r _ {t + 1} ^ {p} \right] + \frac {1}{2} \operatorname {v a r} ((1 - \gamma) r _ {t + 1} ^ {p}) \\ \end{array}
$$

plug  $r_{t + 1}^p$  in to get

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ (1 - \gamma) r _ {t + 1} ^ {p} \right] + \frac {1}{2} v a r ((1 - \gamma) r _ {t + 1} ^ {p}) = (1 - \gamma) \left(x _ {t} ^ {\prime} (\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r _ {t + 1} - r _ {t} ^ {f} ] + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2}) + r _ {t} ^ {f} - \frac {1}{2} x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \Sigma_ {t} x _ {t}\right) + \frac {1}{2} (1 - \gamma) ^ {2} x _ {t} ^ {\prime} \Sigma_ {t} x _ {t}
$$

the first order condition w.r.t.  $x_{t}$  is given by

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ r _ {t + 1} - r _ {t} ^ {f} \right] + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} - \gamma \Sigma x _ {t} = 0
$$

Hence,

$$
x _ {t} = \gamma^ {- 1} \Sigma_ {t} ^ {- 1} \left(\mathbb {E} \left[ r _ {t + 1} - r _ {t} ^ {f} \right] + \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {t} ^ {2}\right).
$$

note that  $\Sigma_t$  must be reversible, otherwise we can synthesize another risk-free assets with the risky assets.

# A.42 Proposition 10.1 in Section 10.A

Proof. The bond market clearing condition requires that

$$
\exp (r _ {t} ^ {*}) b _ {F, t} ^ {*} + \exp (r _ {t}) n (\exp (\psi_ {t}) - 1) - m \frac {\mathbb {E} _ {t} [ r x _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1})}{\omega v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1})} = 0
$$

As shocks become small, the variance term becomes second-order and drops out. Below, we log-linearize the equation around steady states  $\exp (\bar{r}) = \exp (\bar{r}^{*}) = \delta^{-1}$ ,  $\bar{\psi} = 0$ ,  $\bar{b}_H = \bar{b}_F = 0$ ,  $\bar{e} = 0$  and some  $\bar{y}$ . Note that both noise traders and intermediaries are holding zero-cost

portofolios, hence  $b_{H,t} + \exp (-e_t)b_{F,t} = 0$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*} \right]}{\omega v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) / m} = \exp (\bar {r}) n \psi_ {t} - \exp (\bar {e} + \bar {r} ^ {*} - \bar {r}) b _ {H, t} \exp (r _ {t}) \\ \Rightarrow \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} + r _ {t} - r _ {t} ^ {*} ] = \chi_ {1} \psi_ {t} - \chi_ {2} \frac {b _ {H , t} \exp (r _ {t})}{\bar {Y}}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\chi_{1} = n\omega var_{t}(\Delta e_{t + 1}) / m\delta ,\chi_{2} = \omega var_{t}(\Delta e_{t + 1})\bar{Y} /m$

# A.43 Proposition 10.2 in Section 10.B

Proof. Assuming log-normality, the 4 Euler equations can be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l} - \lambda_ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] + r _ {t} + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}), \\ - \xi_ {t} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ m _ {t + 1} ] + r _ {t} ^ {*} - \mathbb {E} _ {t} [ \Delta e _ {t + 1} ] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}) + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} (\Delta e _ {t + 1}) - c o v _ {t} (m _ {t + 1}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}), \\ - \xi_ {t} ^ {*} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} \right] + r _ {t} ^ {*} + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right), \\ - \lambda_ {t} ^ {*} = \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ m _ {t + 1} ^ {*} \right] + r _ {t} + \mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \Delta e _ {t + 1} \right] + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right) + \frac {1}{2} v a r _ {t} \left(\Delta e _ {t + 1}\right) + c o v _ {t} \left(m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

Adding up the first and third equation and subtracting the second and the fourth yields

$$
c o v _ {t} \big (m _ {t + 1} - m _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \Delta e _ {t + 1} \big) = v a r _ {t} \big (\Delta e _ {t + 1} \big) + \big (\lambda_ {t} ^ {*} - \lambda_ {t} \big) - \big (\xi_ {t} ^ {*} - \xi_ {t} \big).

# A.44 Proposition 10.3 in Section 10.C

Proof. First, subtract the first first-order condition by the second and plug in the consumption aggregation equations to get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - \gamma (\hat {c} _ {t} (a) - \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (a)) + (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a) - \alpha \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} + \alpha \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) - (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) = 0 \\ \Rightarrow (\alpha - 1 - \gamma \alpha) \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) + (1 - \gamma) (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a) + (\alpha + \gamma - \gamma \alpha) \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) + (\gamma - 1) \alpha \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a) = 0 \tag {A.40} \\ \end{array}
$$

similarly, subtract the third first-order condition by the fourth and plug in the consumption aggregation equation to get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - \gamma (\hat {c} _ {t} (a) - \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (a)) - \alpha \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a) + (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a) - (1 - \alpha) c _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) + \alpha \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) = 0 \\ \Rightarrow (1 - \gamma) \alpha \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) + (\alpha \gamma - \gamma - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a) + (\gamma - 1) (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) + (\gamma \alpha + 1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a) = 0 \tag {A.41} \\ \end{array}
$$

Next, consider the inactive households' consumption aggregation equations their within-period solution and plug in their budget con

straints to get:

$$
\alpha \hat {c} _ {H, t} (i) + (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {F, t} (i) = \hat {\tau} _ {t}
$$

$$
\alpha \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (i) + (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (i) = \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*}
$$

$$
\hat {c} _ {H, t} (i) - \hat {c} _ {F, t} (i) = \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) - \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a)
$$

$$
\hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (i) - \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (i) = \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) - \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a)
$$

taken active households' consumption as given, the 4 simultaneous equations solve for inactive households' consumption:

$$
\hat {c} _ {H, t} (i) = \hat {\tau} _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) - (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a)
$$

$$
\hat {c} _ {F, t} (i) = \hat {\tau} _ {t} - \alpha \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) + \alpha \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a)
$$

$$
\hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (i) = \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*} + \alpha \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) - \alpha \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a)
$$

$$

$$

plug into the social planner's resource constraints to get

$$
\begin{array}{l} \bar {y} \hat {y} _ {t} = \phi (\bar {c} _ {H} (a) \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) + \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (a) \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a)) \\ + (1 - \phi) (\bar {c} _ {H} (i) (\hat {\tau} _ {t} + (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) - (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a)) + \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (i) (\hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*} + \alpha \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) - \alpha \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a))) \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \bar {y} ^ {*} \hat {y} _ {t} ^ {*} = \phi (\bar {c} _ {F} (a) \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a) + \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (a) \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a)) \\ + (1 - \phi) (\bar {c} _ {F} (i) (\hat {\tau} _ {t} - \alpha \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) + \alpha \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a)) + \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (i) (\hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*} - (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) + (1 - \alpha) \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a))) \tag {A.43} \\ \end{array}
$$

Recast Eq. (A.40), Eq. (A.41), Eq. (A.42) and Eq. (A.43) to solve for  $\hat{c}_{H,t}(a)$ ,  $\hat{c}_{F,t}(a)$ ,  $\hat{c}_{H,t}^{*}(a)$  and  $\hat{c}_{F,t}^{*}(a)$  simultaneously:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c} \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) \\ \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a) \\ \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) \\ \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a) \end{array} \right] = A ^ {- 1} \left[ \begin{array}{c} \bar {y} \hat {y} _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {H} (i) \hat {\tau} _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (i) \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*} \\ \bar {y} ^ {*} \hat {y} _ {t} ^ {*} - (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {F} (i) \hat {\tau} _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (i) \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*} \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]

where  $A$  is given by

$$

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} \phi \bar {c} _ {H} (a) + (1 - \phi) (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} _ {H} (i) & - (1 - \phi) (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} _ {H} (i) & \phi \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (a) + (1 - \phi) \alpha \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (i) & - (1 - \phi) \alpha \bar {c} _ {H} ^ {*} (i) \\ - (1 - \phi) \alpha \bar {c} _ {F} (i) & \phi \bar {c} _ {F} (a) + (1 - \phi) \alpha \bar {c} _ {F} (i) & - (1 - \phi) (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (i) & \phi \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (a) + (1 - \phi) (1 - \alpha) \bar {c} _ {F} ^ {*} (i) \\ \alpha - 1 - \gamma \alpha & (1 - \gamma) (1 - \alpha) & \alpha + \gamma - \gamma \alpha & (\gamma - 1) \alpha \\ (\gamma - 1) \alpha & \alpha + \gamma - \gamma \alpha & (1 - \gamma) (1 - \alpha) & \alpha - 1 - \gamma \alpha \end{array} \right]
$$

Finally, the exchange rate is given by

$$
\hat {e} _ {t} = - \gamma (\hat {c} _ {t} (a) - \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (a))
$$

meanwhile, adding up active and inactive households' consumption yields the total consumption, i.e.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \hat {c} _ {t} = \phi \bar {c} _ {t} (a) \hat {c} _ {t} (a) + (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {t} (i) \hat {c} _ {t} (i) \\ \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} = \phi \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (a) \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (a) + (1 - \phi) \bar {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (i) \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (i) \\ \end{array}
$$

# A.45 Proposition 10.4 in Section 10.C

Proof. First, we show the steady state under in special case where  $\pi = 1/2$ ,  $\bar{y} = \bar{y}^* = 1$ ,  $\bar{\tau} = \bar{\tau}^* = \alpha^\alpha (1 - \alpha)^{1 - \alpha}$ . Note that the two countries are perfectly symmetric in the steady state. Hence,  $\bar{c}_{H,t}(.) = \bar{c}_{F,t}^*(.)$ ,  $\bar{c}_{F,t}(.) = \bar{c}_{H,t}^*(.)$ . Plug this equality into the active households' first-order conditions and divide the first first-order condition by the second one to get:

$$
\frac {\bar {c} _ {F , t} (a)}{\bar {c} _ {H , t} (a)} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha}.
$$

As shown above, this also implies

$$
\frac {\bar {c} _ {F , t} (i)}{\bar {c} _ {H , t} (i)} = \frac {1 - \alpha}{\alpha}.
$$

Recall that  $(\bar{c}_{H,t}(i))^{\alpha}(\bar{c}_{F,t}(i))^{1 - \alpha} = \tau$ , hence

$$
\bar {c} _ {H} (i) = \frac {\alpha}{(1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \alpha^ {\alpha}} \bar {\tau} = \alpha ,
$$

$$
\bar {c} _ {F} (i) = \frac {1 - \alpha}{(1 - \alpha) ^ {1 - \alpha} \alpha^ {\alpha}} \bar {\tau} = 1 - \alpha .
$$

Plugging the steady state consumption into the earlier intermediate results and letting  $\alpha \rightarrow 1$  yields:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c} \hat {c} _ {H, t} (a) \\ \hat {c} _ {F, t} (a) \\ \hat {c} _ {H, t} ^ {*} (a) \\ \hat {c} _ {F, t} ^ {*} (a) \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} \frac {1}{\phi} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ - \frac {\gamma - 1}{\phi} & \frac {\gamma}{\phi} & 0 & 1 \\ \frac {\gamma}{\phi} & - \frac {\gamma - 1}{\phi} & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac {1}{\phi} & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} \hat {y} _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \hat {\tau} _ {t} \\ \hat {y} _ {t} ^ {*} - (1 - \phi) \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*} \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
$$

which implies

$$
\hat {c} _ {t} (a) = \frac {1}{\phi} (\hat {y} _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \hat {\tau} _ {t}), \quad \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} (a) = \frac {1}{\phi} (\hat {y} _ {t} ^ {*} - (1 - \phi) \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*}).
$$

Note that when  $\alpha \to 1$ ,  $\bar{c}(i) = \bar{c}^*(i) = \bar{\tau} \to 1$ . Also,  $\bar{c}(a) = \bar{c}^*(a) \to 1$ . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \hat {c} _ {t} = \phi \bar {c} (a) \hat {c} _ {t} (a) + (1 - \phi) \bar {c} (i) \hat {c} _ {t} (i) \\ = \hat {y} _ {t} - (1 - \phi) \hat {\tau} _ {t} + (1 - \phi) \hat {\tau} _ {t} \\ = \hat {y} _ {t}, \\ \end{array}
$$

which implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} \hat {e} _ {t} = - \frac {\gamma}{\phi} (\hat {y} _ {t} - \hat {y} _ {t} ^ {*}) + \frac {\gamma}{\phi} (1 - \phi) (\hat {\tau} _ {t} - \hat {\tau} _ {t} ^ {*}), \\ \hat {c} _ {t} ^ {*} - \hat {c} _ {t} = - (\hat {y} _ {t} - \hat {y} _ {t} ^ {*}). \\ \end{array}
$$

And the covariance is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} c o v _ {t} (\hat {e} _ {t + 1}, \hat {e} _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \hat {e} _ {t + 1}) = \frac {\gamma}{\phi} \left(v a r (\hat {y} _ {t + 1} - \hat {y} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}) - (1 - \phi) c o v _ {t} (\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1} - \hat {\tau} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \hat {y} _ {t + 1} - \hat {y} _ {t + 1} ^ {*})\right) \\ = \frac {\gamma}{\phi} \left(2 \sigma_ {y} ^ {2} - 2 (1 - \phi) \rho \sigma_ {y} \sigma_ {\tau}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} c o r r _ {t} (\hat {e} _ {t + 1}, \hat {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {*} - \hat {c} _ {t + 1}) = \frac {\frac {\gamma}{\phi} \left(2 \sigma_ {y} ^ {2} - 2 (1 - \phi) \rho \sigma_ {y} \sigma_ {\tau}\right)}{\frac {\gamma}{\phi} 2 \sigma_ {y} \sqrt {\sigma_ {y} ^ {2} + (1 - \phi) ^ {2} \sigma_ {\tau} ^ {2} - 2 (1 - \phi) \rho \sigma_ {y} \sigma_ {\tau}}} \\ = \frac {1 - (1 - \phi) \rho \frac {\sigma_ {\tau}}{\sigma_ {y}}}{\sqrt {1 + (1 - \phi) ^ {2} \frac {\sigma_ {\tau} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {y} ^ {2}} - 2 (1 - \phi) \rho \frac {\sigma_ {\tau}}{\sigma_ {y}}}}. \\ \end{array}
$$

where

$$
\rho = c o r r _ {t} (\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1}, \hat {y} _ {t + 1}) = c o r r _ {t} (\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}, \hat {y} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}),
$$

$$
\sigma_ {y} ^ {2} = v a r _ {t} (\hat {y} _ {t + 1}) = v a r _ {t} (\hat {y} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}),
$$

$$
\sigma_ {\tau} ^ {2} = v a r _ {t} \left(\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1}\right) = v a r _ {t} \left(\hat {\tau} _ {t + 1} ^ {*}\right).
$$

However, note that the Backus-Smith correlation is still 1 for active households' consumption. To see this, recall that the exchange rate is given by

$$
\hat {e} _ {t + 1} = \gamma (\hat {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {*} (a) - \hat {c} _ {t + 1} (a)).
$$

Hence,

$$
\operatorname {c o r r} _ {t} \left(\hat {e} _ {t + 1}, \hat {c} _ {t + 1} ^ {*} (a) - \hat {c} _ {t + 1} (a)\right) = 1.
$$
