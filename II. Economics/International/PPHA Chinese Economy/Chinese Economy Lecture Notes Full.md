# Lecture 1

# The Chinese Economy: Introduction

Shaoda Wang

University of Chicago

# Why China?

"It may well be that when the history of the late 20th century is written in a hundred years, the most significant event will be the revolutionary change in China."

Lawrence Summers, 1992

United States vs China by GDP

In 1978, the Chinese GDP was  $6\%$  of the US GDP;

In 2020, the Chinese GDP became more than  $70\%$  of the US GDP; The IMF projects China to surpass the US in nominal GDP by 2030

India vs China by GDP

This is not to take anything away from India, which also had impressive growth since the 1990s. But given that the two countries are comparable in size, and India even had an edge in the 1950s, comparing the two demonstrates why China's economic transformation is often referred to as the "China miracle."

In 1980, about  $90\%$  of the population lived in poverty (< $\$ 2$ /day), among which  $50\%$  live in absolute poverty (< $\$ 1$ /day). Income level 1/3 that of Sub-Saharan Africa!

After four decades of development and high-powered poverty alleviation programs, poverty rate is below  $1\%$ . More than 800 million people lifted out of poverty!

# Historical Perspective

- So incredible economic transformation happened in China since 1978.  
- But HOW?  
- And WHY?  
- To understand what happened since 1978, we need to first understand how we got there
- Why was China poor before 1978?

Why did China choose a centrally planned economic system, and how did it (fail to) work?

What caused the largest famine in human history during this period?

We discuss these questions in Lectures 4 and 5.

# Why were Economists Bearish about China?

- "Washington Consensus" prescribes the key steps for economic transition
- Letting the government get out of way  
- Letting the market work  
- Providing private incentives  
- Opening up to the global market

Economists believed in the "Big bang" reform strategy: all distortions need to be removed at once

- China, instead, followed a different, "gradual" approach

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/8e9b5aabd12f0bf90a601d3a62b054918f13d6ab63ab9db6d9292e56cf57b1c5.jpg)

In Lectures 6 to 9, we will analyze in great detail how China's gradual reform approach worked, and why it outperformed the shock therapy.

Large real estate bubble, mounting local debts  
Tradeoffs between environmental protection and growth  
- Concerning demographic features  
- Growing rural-urban gap and lowering social mobility  
- Worsening geo-political environment

The east was economically dominant until the late  $18^{\text{th}}$  century.

Then the west experienced explosive growth and quickly took over.

Industrial revolution allows societies to accumulate productivity gains and realize exponential growth

# This Lecture

- The great divergence: why did the industrial revolution take place in Europe instead of China?
- "When China was using iron-tipped plows, Europe was using wooden ones. But when Europe was using steel plows, China was still using iron."

# Conventional Wisdom: Europe was Richer than China long before the Industrial Revolution

GDP per capita data seems to support this claim (based on 1990 international dollar)

# Conventional Wisdom: Europe was Richer than China long before the Industrial Revolution

"Anyone who looked at the world, say a thousand years ago, would never have predicted great things for this protrusion at the western end of the Eurasian landmass that we call the continent of Europe…. the probability at that point of European global dominance was somewhere around zero. Five hundred years later, it was getting close to one."

David Landes, The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, 1998

# Challenging the Conventional Wisdom

What is the hole in this logic?

# The California School

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/0cab505c57e3f3ea44db7d00cd5e875e81a3f519d75913d92f44adb1d8808c07.jpg)

The "California School" historians pointed out that, comparing the average income of China to that of England or Netherlands was not using the correct benchmark, given that China was more populous that the entire continental Europe.

Instead, they suggested that, one should be comparing the most developed regions in China, to the most developed countries in Europe, which would be a more meaningful comparison.

# Yangtze River Delta

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/ac15ccb38272069bbcb4bc09f9ffb6c8ee3724dcedcb6b2bd94d20f07e375935.jpg)

Following this logic, Kenneth Pomeranz and other historians compared China's Yangtze River Delta (YRD) to England.

The YRD was the most developed region in China, economically, scientifically, and culturally.

According to Pomeranz's research, by 1750, the YRD and England were surprisingly similar in terms of market development, average caloric intake, average income, average consumption, and life expectancy. So neither was necessarily on course for modern economic growth.

# Yangtze Delta vs. Europe Frontier

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/49f887bada3afe0816a6eb65eaa4da8e9e56ae9c274046fd4dcab796b98aa266.jpg)

According to Pomeranz, until the early  $18^{\text{th}}$  century, the YRD was actually surprisingly similar to the richest region of Europe, in terms GDP pc.

Mokyr also points out that urban salary in England is a compensating differential for worse living and working conditions (urban workers have shorter life exp by 15 years), and thereby overestimates the level of economic development in England.

Evidence is thus inconsistent with the conventional wisdom.

# Anecdotal Records from Foreign Expats

- During Ming and Qing dynasties, many foreign expats visited China, and many of them compared China favorably to Europe in terms of economic prosperity
- Influenced by these expats, European elites generally believed that China was the richest country globally (e.g., Adam Smith repeatedly referred to China as the world's most prosperous nation in "The Wealth of Nations")

# So Why Did the Industrial Revolution Not Start in China?

- Several major competing theories:
- Coal availability  
- Access to the new world  
- Political fragmentation  
- Patent system  
— Demographics and demand for technologies  
- Scientific revolution
- If China did have industrial revolution, would it have been able to sustain it?

# Coal Availability?

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/1ae347bdf3e1b3991db3ce552f72062476852116be23202b88a10f1dd77899ca.jpg)

Coal was the predominant energy source for the industrial revolution.  

- Pomeranz drew attention to differences in the availability of coal between West and East
- Due to regional climate, European coal mines were wetter, so harder to explode; while Chinese coal mines located in more arid regions, thus more likely to explode without sufficient ventilation  
- In Britain, coal deposits all located within a compact island; while in China, coal deposits located in the northeast, far away from the economic center (Yangtze Delta), meaning that shipping cost alone might exceed the initial benefit from early industrial revolution

Economists remain doubtful of this explanation: (1) the role of coal in industrial revolution might be much smaller than previously thought (Clark and Jacks, 2006); (2) China could have moved heavy industrial clusters to the northeast (McCloskey, 2010)

# The New World?

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/53478ed1ba73ebdae7ed7eb31cc44628e0d5a533b756831ab45e31cc80289fe9.jpg)

- The high profits earned from the new world was extremely helpful for the capital accumulation of the European countries.  
- According to Pomeranz, an even more central advantage for Europe was the vast amount of fertile, uncultivated land in the Americas, which freed up the European land for industrial revolution ("ghost acres")
- New World exports of wood, cotton, and wool saved England the need for 23 to 25 million acres of cultivated land (total cultivated land in England was 17 million acres)

# Political Fragmentation (Jared Diamond)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/ee01ab8634fe3c750b84871dd027b01c31d16155db6fcedd89d14a8832898bf1.jpg)

- Europe's geography encouraged political fragmentation, such as having large peninsulas and natural barriers such as mountains and straits that provided defensible borders.  
- By contrast, China's geography encouraged political unity, with a much smoother coastline and a heartland dominated by two river valleys (Yellow and Yangtze).  
Under long-term unity, the lack of international competitions (e.g., wars) discourages technological as well as policy innovations.

# Political Fragmentation

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/7f6f3a7976ce066c3b1916ad0cc737b4859d684921c1190535e0d40d73464b34.jpg)

The comparison between Zheng He's ship (1405) and Columbus's ship (1492)

In 1432, the Xuande Emperor outlawed the building of ocean-going ships, in which China was by far the world leader at the time  
In contrast, decades later, Christopher Columbus obtained sponsorship from Queen Isabella I of Castile for his expedition even though three other European rulers turned it down.

- As a result, governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly
- But following this logic, shouldn't China fell behind Europe long ago? Why was China leading prior to the  $18^{\text{th}}$  century?

# The Patent System

"That reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very first official thing I did, in my administration -- and it was on the very first day of it, too -- was to start a patent office; for I knew that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab, and couldn't travel any way but sideways or backways"

-- Mark Twain, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, 1889

# The Patent System

- Many economists believed the patent system to be a fundamental institutional foundation of the industrial revolution.  
- Recent research increasingly challenges this belief:
- Diffusion of technology did not dissipate innovators' rents

(constrained capacity due to shortages of "implementation skills")

- Many patent rules were not strictly enforced in the early stages of the

industrial revolution

- More than  $50 \%$ of the inventions did not get patented, to keep

knowledge secret and prevent diffusion

Patents actually blocked much innovation

Figure 3.1 English laborers' real wages, 1209-1809.

Due to the Black Death and frequent wars, population fell significantly in Europe, and the scarcity of labor led to higher wages

- China did not suffer as much from the Black Death due to better sanitation systems, and experienced fewer wars due to unity. Population was booming.

Higher salary incentivizes important investments

- Workers invest in their own human capital  
- Capitalists invest in labor-saving technologies
- Both important contributors to industrialization

Steady state in the standard Malthusian model

Under the Malthusian framework, any temporary population/wage shock would be absorbed by population adjustments, unless there is sustained technological innovation.

labor saving technologies -> higher marginal product of labor -> higher wages -> labor saving technologies

From an economist's perspective, the industrial revolution was powerful because it accelerated the speed of innovation to close the positive feedback loop, thereby generating exponential growth.

China used to be at the world's technological frontier for more than 15 centuries, but essentially became irrelevant after the scientific revolution took place in Europe after the  $16^{\mathrm{th}}$  century.

So even if China, instead of Europe, was able to trigger the industrial revolution, China lacked the scientific capacity to sustain it.

# Technological Innovations

- Technological discovery is about finding more efficient combinations of inputs
- Historically, this was done via trial and error. So the more populous a country was, the more discoveries it would encounter (passive innovation)
- After the scientific revolution in Europe, technological innovation became an active process:
- Scientific theories guide the directions of exploration  
- Scientifically controlled experiments drastically increase the efficiency of "trial and error"

As a result, population size became less relevant

# The Needham Puzzle

"Francis Bacon had selected three inventions, paper and printing, gunpowder, and the magnetic compass, which had done more than (anything else), he thought, to transform completely the modern world and mark it off from the antiquity of the Middle Ages. He regarded the origins of these inventions as 'obscure and inglorious' and he died without ever knowing that all of them were Chinese."

"Why did modern science, the mathematization of hypotheses about Nature, with all its implications for advanced technology, take its meteoric rise only in the West at the time of Galileo? Why it had not developed in Chinese civilization which in the previous many centuries was much more efficient in applying natural knowledge to practical needs?"

# Cultural Explanation for the Lack of Scientific Revolution in China

- Confucianism, which emphasized "social harmony" and "harmony between man and nature," was more about "natural law" than "law of nature"
- The western tradition of "law of nature" was rooted in religion, and further grew after the enlightenment
- "Law of nature" generates "useful knowledge"

# Institutional Explanation for the Lack of Scientific Revolution in China

- China was the first country in world history to develop a modern political meritocracy: the imperial civil exam (Keju)

-Tang dynasty (618-907) to 1905  
- Test on classics and "Eight Legged Essays"  
- Pillar of social mobility

Figure 3: The Dynamic Impacts of the Quotas on Revolution Participation

The civil exam was a key institution that helped maintain social mobility (and hence, stability) in Chinese history

When the civil exam was abolished in 1905, regions with higher quotas had more people joining revolutions

# Institutional Explanation for the Lack of Scientific Revolution in China

- The civil service exam (Keju) was attached to significant political and economic rewards, making the opportunity cost of studying other subjects relatively very high  
- The civil service exam focused exclusively on reading the Confucius classics and writing the eight-legged essays, thereby discouraging talented individuals from studying science and conducting scientific research

"Explanation of the Works of Nature" was one of the most important scientific works in historical China. The author, Song Yingxing, said in his introduction chapter that:

"This book is not for those who are smart and ambitious, because it has nothing to do with the civil exam."

The Macartney Mission was the first British diplomatic mission to China, which took place in 1793. It is named for its leader, George Macartney, Great Britain's first envoy to China, trying to establish treaty ports and trade agreements.

The British refused to kneel with both knees when meeting the Qianlong emperor, and Qianlong rejected all British requests.

"Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its borders. There is therefore no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce."

Qing rulers actually showed strong interests in the Western technologies. Emperor Kangxi (Qianlong's grandfather), for example, had a globe in his office, various foreign teachers for math and astronomy, and large collections of western clocks and telescopes.

So why the arrogance, and why rejecting more openness and communications?

- "Exceptionalism" mindset could be one factor, but there are deeper reasons.  
- The Manchurians (<0.3% of population) built the Qing empire by overthrowing the Ming empire (Han Chinese, >90% of population). Handling the threat from Han Chinese had always been the top priority of Qing rulers, and they made a deliberate choice to keep western science and technologies secret, especially from Han Chinese.  
- When missionaries were translating science works, Kangxi required them to do it at home, rather than in office, to avoid being seen by Han Chinese colleagues  
- Macartney himself remarked that the Qing government was very "myopic," and "only cared about preventing the enlightenment of its people"

# Wakeup Call: The Opium War

- In the  $18^{\text{th}}$  century, China enjoyed large trade surplus against Britain by selling porcelain, silk, and tea  
- To reduce the trade deficit, the British used the East India Company to sell opium to China  
- Opium trade grew quickly in China (1400 tons per year), many Chinese quickly became addicted  
- In 1838, China banned opium trade, sentenced drug traffickers to death. In 1839, Lin Zexu seized and destroyed British opium in Canton, leading to the first Opium War.

- China first invented firearms and gunpowder before the  $10^{\text{th}}$  century, later diffused to Europe through the Arabians in the  $14^{\text{th}}$  century.
- So why did China fall so much behind, in the technologies it invented?
- Early firearms were suitable for attacking city defense, but not suitable for mobile war in open space  
China's main enemies were the northern nomads (calvaries), while most European countries fought each other by attacking city defense and infantries  
- European countries therefore consistently refined and innovated the firearms, while China did not pursue that path

- UK and France occupied Beijing (1856-1860)  
- Destroyed the Summer Palace  
- Forced China to open up (treaty ports, ships, foreigners, embassies)  
- Huge reparations to UK and France  
Ceded 1.5 million sq km of land to Russia

# The Summer Palace

"One day two bandits entered the Summer Palace. One plundered, the other burned…. Before history, one of the two bandits will be called France; the other will be called England." --Victor Hugo

# The Westernization Movement

- The two opium wars served as a true wake-up call for the Chinese elites  
Realizing the huge gap between China and the Western powers in artifacts, the Qing government started the "Westernization Movement"

- While little appreciation for institutional gaps
- "Chinese learning for fundamental principles and western learning for practical application"

# The Westernization Movement

- Qing elites still believed that the Confucianism culture was superior, and China could be prosperous and strong as long as it can build/purchase enough guns, cannons, and warships
- Under this ideology, China did make some important progresses:
- Industrialization  
- Military reforms  
- Strengthening naval force

# Sino-Japanese War in 1894

- Japan, just went through the Meiji restoration, was trying to colonize Korea, which was a tributary state of Qing  
- International community generally favored Qing, given that the Beiyang army had much larger warships  
- But the Beiyang ships were poorly maintained, and the army poorly trained. In the end, Qing had a humiliating defeat, and ceded Taiwan to Japan  
- Marked the transition of regional domination in Asia from China to Japan

# Further Reforms and End of Qing

- Not just artifacts, but also ideas, institutions and values  
- Qing government tried to transit towards a constitutional monarchy in 1898, but failed due to resistance of the vested interest
- Boxer rebellion and the Eight Nation Alliance Invasion (1989-- 1901)  
- Oversea students and activists, such as Sun Yat-Sen, advocated for the presidential system, and overthrew the Qing government in 1911 to establish the Republic of China

# Post Qing

1912--1927: Warlords divided China  

- 1927--1937: Ten years of relative peace under KMT rule  
1937-1945: Sino-Japanese war/WWII  
- 1945--1949: Civil war between KMT and CPC

# The Rise of Socialist Ideas

What made socialist ideas popular in China?  

- Western phobia among Chinese people after consecutive defeats, eager to try a system superior to the Western institution  
- Russia satisfied both conditions:
- When Russia established a socialist regime, it unilaterally withdrew all the unequal treaties signed with China, gaining popular support in China  
- In the 1930s, when the west was stuck in the Great Depression, the USSR quickly became powerful, setting a great example for China

# Marxist Ideas (2-min version)

- Fundamental problems with capitalism
- There is a significant oversupply of labor, which forms a huge "unemployed populace"  
- This allows capitalists to suppress wages to the minimum, without fear of labor shortages  
- As a result, there will be an ever-widening wealth gap between workers and capitalists, leading to the overthrown of capitalism
- Marx thus put forward the theory of historical materialism, which identified the five stages for societal change:
- Primitive communism -> slavery -> feudalism -> capitalism -> communism

# Socialist Revolution: the Soviet Model

Marx argued that, the socialist revolution must be spontaneous, rather than pushed by a party. With the development of capitalism, the working class in all advanced capitalist countries will eventually act together and replace the capitalism system.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/7c45d6f251d88618f14c4395c647909f338cedc317e26e60482a9a46264d064c.jpg)

Lenin held a different view: socialist revolution can be planned and organized. But to make this happen, the elites need to form the hard core, and with the solidarity from the city workers, they can organize constant labor uprisings to undermine the regime.

This was exactly how the Tsarist regime was overthrown in Russia in 1917.

# Failure of the Leninist Model in China

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/7ca9914a75a361acc91240d29b604c1de8728bd6d23fcf37e44b7266ac552ab6.jpg)

Marx argued that a socialist revolution has to be "global," otherwise capital will simply flee to other countries

The USSR thus formed the "Third International" to guide socialist revolutions in other countries.

After the Communist Party of China (CPC) was established in 1921, it followed the Leninist model, trying to spark labor uprisings in cities nationwide.

But the efforts were consistently proven unsuccessful.

Why did the Leninist Model fail in China?

# Logic of October Revolution in Russia

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/0f5c32bdd0aa23a0e25622e81a01412e80fbf5bba002518c542148e97c2943fe.jpg)

In Russia, industries concentrated in cities, and were owned by the tsar and the nobility. So when there were urban labor uprisings, the tsar would send troops to crush them, which made more citizens sympathize the working class and angry about the government.

# Why the CPC Failed to Replicate the Soviet Model

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/daad8bec7d1239e9135afb7d6361c9a2b1c77a7d774d38fb3eb0c85fce01c771.jpg)

In China, industries concentrated in foreign concessions, and were owned by the foreign capitalists. So when there were urban labor uprisings, the foreign police would crush them, which directs societal anger towards the foreign invaders, and makes the citizens even more supportive of the ruling party (KMT).

# Socialist Revolution: the Chinese Model

- The then young Mao Zedong developed the strategy of "Encircling the cities with rural areas."  
- Mao pointed out that, in rural villages, landlords "exploit" the poor farmers and landless peasants. This is similar to how "capitalists exploit the workers" in the Marxist-Leninist argument.  
- In China's case, the landlords were usually also in charge of local governance ("gentry class"). So inciting peasant uprisings against landlords could achieve the anticipated effects of the Leninist approach: directing anger towards the ruling class while winning the sympathy of the society.

# Mao's Approach: Encircling Cities with Rural Areas

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/75808212f4f05a272fbe41c13d3d3d79a50b58bd5ad78c1de665558b21f5ddd6.jpg)

Mao's approach, expropriating the land of landlords for redistribution to poor peasants, won the CPC huge popular support, and achieved remarkable success.

(The Taliban is reported to have been carefully studying Mao's strategy, which they used to take over Afghanistan over the past decade…)

After the World War II, the CPC won a civil war against the much more powerful KMT, and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.

On October  $1^{st}$  1949, when declaring the establishment of the PRC, Mao said that "The Chinese People have stood up!"

This is a very masterfully chosen expression, which reflects on the "century of humiliation" that the country has went through up to this point.

And this mindset of "standing up against foreign powers regaining dignity" is key to understanding China's planned economic system after 1949.

# Legacy of pre-1949 economy

- Smallest GDP share of the world in history  
- Some heavy industry base in Northeast China inherited from the Japanese  
- Light industry in port cities  
- On average a very poor peasant economy
- Industrialization indicators significantly lower than India

# Prioritizing Heavy Industries

- After the "century of humiliation," the Chinese leadership was desperate to develop a strong national defense (military industry)  
This led to the decision to prioritize the heavy industries, following the Soviet model

- This was a popular choice among developing countries at that time: India, Egypt, Indonesia, Tanzania, and several Latin American countries followed similar strategies

# Initial Economic Development Plans

- Upon founding the PRC, the CPC announced three economic guidelines:
- Expropriating the land of landlords for redistribution to poor farmers  
- Expropriating foreign capital and monopolistic bureaucratic capital for national property  
- Protecting industries and commerce owned by national capitalists and guaranteeing them a golden age of at least 50 years under socialist leadership

# Initial Economic Development Plans

- Under the three guidelines, national capitalists would be given "at least 50 years of golden age," which looked amazing, given the removal of foreign competitors
- But this promise was quickly revoked in 1953, when the state took over all the industrial resources
- Why did this happen? We will examine the logic in the next lecture

Centrally planned economic system: Why? How?

# Brief history

1949-52: Economic recovery to the 1937 level  
1953--78: Copy of the Soviet model: central planning, prioritizing heavy industries, nationalizing assets, micro-managing SOEs  

- But frequent detours:
- 1959--61: Mao's model: Great Leap Forward  
- 1962--65: Economic recovery  
- 1966--76: Mao's model again: Cultural Revolution  
- 1977--78: Transitional period
- This lecture focuses on the logic of central planning, next lecture covers Mao's campaigns

# 1949—1952: Economic Recovery

- Upon founding the PRC, the CPC announced three economic guidelines, which was largely followed between 1949 and 1952:
- Expropriating the land of landlords for redistribution to poor farmers  
- Expropriating foreign capital and monopolistic bureaucratic capital for national property  
- Protecting industries and commerce owned by national capitalists and guaranteeing them a golden age of at least 50 years under socialist leadership

# 1953—1978: Following USSR Model

- The first 5-year plan, started to follow the

Soviet system, prioritizing heavy industries

- Urban areas: nationalization of domestic industrial and commercial assets, distorted prices, micro-management of SOEs  
- Rural areas: state monopoly of agricultural output, suppressing output prices, collectivization of agriculture, rural-urban dichotomy

# Distortions in the Planned Economy

- At first glance: the post-1953 economic system is full of idiosyncratic distortions and restrictions  
- This lecture: conditional on the national goal, all these arrangements can be rationalized

# Why the Sudden Changes Since 1953?

- After the "century of humiliation," the Chinese leadership was desperate to develop a strong national defense (military industry)  
This led to the decision to prioritize the heavy industries, following the Soviet model

- This was a popular choice among developing countries at that time: India, Egypt, Indonesia, Tanzania, and several Latin American countries followed similar strategies

# Departing from China's Factor Endowments and Comparative Advantage

- Heavy industries have long construction period (take longer to see returns, relative to light industries)
- But developing countries lack capital, so have higher interest rates
- The key technologies and equipment need to be imported
- But developing countries have limited foreign exchange reserves, and face expensive exchange rates (due to inability to export)
- Heavy industries require huge initial fixed capital investments
- But developing countries have dispersed agricultural production, making it difficult to raise capital (taxes)

# The Internal Logic of the Traditional Economic System

In order to prioritize capital-intensive

industries, a developing economy needs to:

- Suppress interest rate well below market rate  
- Overvalue domestic currency and undervalue foreign currency  
- Ensure high profits for existing state-owned enterprises for capital accumulation

# Two ways to Increase Profits for Existing Enterprises

- Grant them a monopoly, so that they can set monopolistic prices, harvesting higher profits  
- Suppress the prices of all productive inputs, including the prices of capital, raw materials, and labor
- Given the low wages, the government has to also drive down the prices of food, clothes, housing, transportation, and services, etc.

# Shortage Economy

- When capital price is suppressed, demand for capital increases in both heavy and light industries, while incentives to save decrease, resulting in shortage of capital  
- When domestic currency is overvalued and foreign currency undervalued, import should increase while export should fall, resulting in shortage of foreign exchange  
- When the prices of daily necessities and raw materials are suppressed, demand will similarly exceed supply, resulting in shortage of these commodities

# Shortage Leads to State Ownership and Central Planning

- Given the shortages in capital, foreign exchange, and commodities, in a free market, these resources would flow toward the light industries, since they have higher returns
- But that goes against prioritizing heavy industries
- To prioritize heavy industries, these resources thus need to be owned and allocated by the state
- This explains why the initial protection of "national capitalists" got reversed quickly

# State Ownership and Central Planning Lead to Micro-Management

- Without a free market, it is difficult for the government to learn about an enterprise's profit, creating principal-agent problems between the state and the managers
- Managers would exaggerate their losses and understate profits, to gain personal benefits over national interest
- Therefore, the government has to deprive the SOE managers of any discretion, and micro-manage the input-output decisions, leading to a highly planned economy

# Short Summary: Trinity of the Centrally Planned Economic System

- Trinity of Central Planning
- Distorted prices of various factors and products  
- State ownership and planned allocation  
- Powerless managers at the micro level
- Conditional on the goal being to prioritize the heavy industries, these arrangements were actually very rational!

# Impacts on the Rural Economy

- State monopoly over the purchasing and marketing of agricultural products  
- Collectivization of agricultural production  
- The urban-rural dichotomy (the "Hukou" system)

# State Monopoly of Agricultural Products

- Between 1949 and 1953, the government launched the campaign of "overthrowing the landlords and distributing their lands to farmers," which was hugely popular  
- Between 1949 and 1953, since there was little central planning, agricultural outputs were sold at the market prices (to either the government or other private buyers)
- Three types of grain and cotton businesses in rural areas: government run, privately run, and jointly run

# State Monopoly of Agricultural Products

- In 1953, the  $1^{\text{st }}$  Five Year Plan kicked off, which prioritized heavy industries, causing the suppression of input prices  
- To do so, the government set below-market prices in rural areas for all farm products, so that it could sell them at low prices in cities, transferring rural surplus to urban areas
- Government had to monopolize procurement (up to a quota), otherwise farmers sell to other buyers  
- Had to cover all crops, otherwise farmers switch crops

# Collectivization of Agriculture

- The low government procurement price led to reduced efforts from the farmers (opportunity cost of resting was too low)  
- Potential ways to improve agricultural output:
- Increase procurement price, but that defeats the whole purpose  
- More investment in agriculture, again, defeats the purpose  
- How can the government increase output without additional capital input? Is there "free lunch" in agricultural production?

# Economy of Scale for Agriculture

No more need for field ridges, reducing waste of arable land

# Collectivization of Agriculture

- Farmers were organized into teams, first of several households, later enlarged to 20-30 households, later 150-200 households, finally to around 5000 households.  
- Worked well initially, but later led to the greatest famine in human history between 1959 and 1961 (we will cover this in the next lecture)

# Rural-Urban Dichotomy

- Before 1953, population flow was quite free within China  
- Since 1953, the government started to tax the rural areas to subsidize the urban areas (with the distorted prices), which incentivized rural-urban migration
- But heavy industries are capital intensive, not labor intensive, so there were not enough jobs in the urban areas  
- The government had to introduce a household registration system to prevent population flows: Hukou System

# Urban--rural divide

# - Urban residence privileges

- Food, clothes, edible oil coupons, and entitlement to other scarce manufacturing goods (e.g., bikes, watches)

Primary and secondary education  

- Guaranteed job

# - Additional benefits in state or collective sectors

- Health care, pension, work unit-supplied housing

# Urban--rural divide

# - Rural residents

- Work unit is the residing village within a Commune  
- Absence of all the privileges and benefits listed above  
- Lower levels of public good  
- Being "taxed" to subsidize the urban residents

GDP per Capita

# Slow growth in consumption per capita

- Natural result of the sectoral bias  
- Consumption pc growth  $2.3\%$  per year – Urban  $3\%$ , rural  $1.8\%$  
- Shortage of consumer goods
- Ration for necessities, e.g., grain, cotton, cloth

# Rapid, unbalanced structural change

1952 1978

Agriculture 51% 28%

Industry 20% 48%

Services 29% 24%

# Slow employment creation

# - Heavy industry is not labor intensive

- Labor force growth  $5.4\%$  per year  
- Industrial growth:  $6 \%$  
- 1952--78, non-agricultural employment: +71m  
- 1952--78, total labor force: +191m  
- 71m/191m = 37%  
- Cultivated land remained constant, so land per farmer dropped substantially

# Overall Evaluation of the Planned Economy

- If the only goal was to develop heavy industries, then the strategy was highly successful:
- Averaged  $6 \%$ industrial growth  
- Tested atomic bomb in 60s, and launched satellite in 70s
- But the costs were also dear for regular citizens:  $70 \%$ of the citizens remained peasants in 1978, low job creation in the cities, slow consumption growth, huge ruralurban gaps, worst famine in human history, etc.

# 1956-57: The Hundred Flowers Campaign

- Intellectuals felt demoralized due to the centralized control since the  $1^{st}$  Five Year Plan  
- Mao started the "Hundred Flowers Campaign," which encouraged citizens to openly express their opinions of the CPC and the country
- "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."  
- "Our society cannot back down, it could only progress… criticism of the bureaucracy is pushing the government towards the better."

- With Mao's encouragement, in Spring 1957, intellectuals started voicing their thoughts without taboo:
- Millions of letters received by the government, "democratic walls" showed up across the country  
- Many sensitive topics covered: the slavish following of Soviet models, the low standards of living in China, the proscription of foreign literature, economic corruption among party cadres, favoritism towards party members, etc.

# 1957: the Anti-Rightist Campaign

- In July 1957, Mao halted the "Hundred Flowers Movement"
- Mao initially expected that after discussion, socialist ideas would appear superior to capitalist ideas, and thus spread nationwide  
- In 1956, Mao witnessed Nikita Khrushchev denouncing Joseph Stalin and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, events by which he felt threatened

# 1957: the Anti-Rightist Campaign

- Shortly after halting the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Mao started the Anti-Rightist Campaign:
- Rightists: intellectuals who appeared to favor capitalism, or were against one-party rule, or against state-run collectivization  
- People who expressed opinions during the Hundred Flowers Campaign got persecuted (researchers say 1.4 million, official sources 550k)  
- Long-lasting impacts: discouraged dissents and made intellectuals reluctant to criticize Mao and the CPC

# 1958-1962: Great Leap Forward

- In 1958, the governments started the  $2^{\text{nd }}$  Five Year Plan
- Keeps prioritizing the heavy industries
- In fear of being classified as "rightist," growth targets were set too high in the plan by politicians:
- Initial yearly growth plan proposed in 1956: industry growth  $9.9\%$ , crop grow  $3.6\%$ , cotton grow  $5.6\%$  
- Revised yearly growth plan more than doubled after the Anti-Rightist Campaign  
- The base year was also over-estimated (due to the same incentive), making the targets infeasible

# 1958--1962: Great Leap Forward

Divergence from Soviet model

- Soured relationship between China and USSR
- Great Leap Forward, launching drastic economic campaigns
- Urban areas: surpass the UK in iron and steel in 15 years -> massive waste  
- Rural areas: people's commune -> the Great Famine

# State Monopoly of Agricultural Products

- In 1953, the  $1^{\text{st }}$  Five year Plan kicked off, which prioritized heavy industries, causing the suppression of input prices  
- To do so, the government set below-market prices in rural areas for all farm products, so that it could sell them at low prices in cities, transferring rural surplus to urban areas
- Government had to monopolize procurement (up to a quota), otherwise farmers sell to other buyers  
- Had to cover all crops, otherwise farmers switch crops

# Collectivization of Agriculture

- The low government procurement price led to reduced efforts from the farmers (opportunity cost of resting was too low)  
- Potential ways to improve agricultural output:
- Increase procurement price, but that defeats the whole purpose  
- More investment in agriculture, again, defeats the purpose  
- Exploit the "economy of scale" for agricultural production, which could increase output without additional capital input

# Economy of Scale for Agriculture

No more need for field ridges, reducing waste of arable land

# Production Teams

- Farmers were organized into production teams, first of several households, later enlarged to 20-30 households, later 150-200 households before 1958  
- Worked well initially (before 1958)
- Agricultural output grew  
- Increased provision of rural public good  
- Mutual insurance

# People's Communes

- In 1958, production teams were "upgraded" to "people's communes," which were more ambitious in various ways:
- Larger in size, covering  $\sim 5000$  households (comparable to township)  
- Made nearly all domestic labor (cooking, childcare, laundry, etc.) communal  
- Initially allocated good and services based on needs (e.g., communal dining)
- Disastrous outcomes after 1958:
- Around 30 million starved to death between 1959 and 1961

# Potential Causes for the Great Famine

- "Allocation explanations"
- Communal dining  
- Excessive procurement / Political Radicalism  
- Rigid procurement rule  
- Household registration system
- "Production explanations"
- Weather shocks  
- Destabilized ecosystem  
- Right to exit communes

# Communal Dining

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/6925ed9b577e779864e6d6c0da143ca4e0a0c9db727ca143f6423bf9f1f5a5f0.jpg)

Created dining halls for each commune, serving three meals per day for free. Led to over-consumption of food, and exhausted food reserve quickly. But can't explain persistence of famine, as well as output reductions (communal dining mostly canceled after 1959).

# Excessive Procurement and Political Radicalism

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/9267f75636b19d2f6d04fd2f44422ec80691041f6f4d907d4dd6a7b4758cacc9.jpg)

Excessive procurement became especially problematic when production data was heavily inflated by incentivized local officials

The famine was significantly more severe in regions with higher productivity! Suggesting that the procurement rule somehow caused a "reversal of fortune"

A simple example of such rigid procurement rule could be one based on expected output. To the extent that the more productive region losses more in a low state, it will have lower residual in the low state

# Household Registration

- Historically, when certain regions suffer from famines, the rural households flee to adjacent regions in order to survive  
- Due to the household registration system introduced during the  $1^{\text{st }}$  5-year plan, refugee migration became much more difficult  
- In order to cover that fact that a famine in going on under his watch, a local politician is incentivized to keep the refugees from leaving

# Explanations for Output Loss

- The aforementioned theories could explain why there might be famine conditional on the same agricultural output, but can't explain the salient drop in output during the GLF  
- Next, we examine three theories for why output would fall

# Weather Shocks?

Notes: The posters show the transition from 1958 to 1960 in the composition of the four pests. The 1960 campaign switched out sparrows with bed bugs after China decided to buy 200,000 sparrows from the Soviet Union to replenish its sparrow population.

Regions more suitable for sparrow habitation suffered larger agricultural output losses during the GLF.

Sparrows got removed from the Four Pests list in 1960, and China had to import  $200\mathrm{k}$  sparrows from the USSR to repopulate them.

# Right to Exit Communes

FIG. 1.-Total factor productivity index, 1952-88 (index:  $1952 = 100$ )

Collectivization led to modest productivity gains initially, but then huge productivity losses after 1958.

Major change in 1958: farmers no longer allowed to freely exit from a production team

# Prisoner's Dilemma

Prisoner 2

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/59f66de6884f88c3a11b5a423f12f663f7c6dca77527795da74eec6eda3713cb.jpg)

Forbidding farmers to exit creates a prisoner's dilemma: each farmer can choose to work hard or to slack; if everyone works hard, total welfare is the highest. But for each individual farmer, slacking is always the dominant choice, and as a result, everyone slacks, leading to huge productivity losses.

# Aftermath of the GLF

- Mao's authority became shaky after the GLF  
- Other party elites advocated for more market-oriented policies to restore individual incentives  
Deng Xiaoping first said his famous quote in 1963: "It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice."  
- Partly to restore his authority, Mao started the "Cultural Revolution" in 1966

# 1966--1976: Cultural Revolution

中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想大学校

- To eliminate his rivals, Mao charged that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society with the aim of restoring capitalism  
He insisted that revisionists be removed through violent class struggle, to which China's youth, as well as urban workers, responded by forming Red Guards and "rebel groups" around the country

# 1966--1976: Cultural Revolution

- Pro-market party establishment destroyed  
- Universities closed; professors and young people sent to contryside  
Economically, militarization (PLA in economy), autarky, no material incentives  
- Widespread violence and even civil conflicts  
- Coup after Mao died in 1976, recentralization and recovery

# Devastating Consequences of the

# Cultural Revolution

- Li Xiannian, China's vice premier at the time, estimated that the direct economic cost of the cultural revolution exceeded 500 billion RMB, equivalent to  $80\%$  of all infrastructure investment in China since 1949.  
- In 1978, China was literally among the poorest countries worldwide: China's GDP pc was \$156; in contrast, Sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region in the world, had a GDP pc of \$490.  
- In 1978,  $80\%$  of China's population were peasants, and 200 million were illiterate.

# CPC's Reflections on Mao

- CPC official verdict on Mao: "70 percent right and 30 percent wrong"
- The exact same evaluation Mao gave Stalin  
- Erza Vogel's book "Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China" vividly described how the CPC elites reached this verdict

Deng on Mao: "a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist… His merits are unquestionably primary and his mistakes secondary."  

- Li Rui (Mao's former secretary) on Mao: "had contributions to the revolution; made mistakes in governance; committed crimes in the Cultural Revolution."

# Reform Process: Overview

Shaoda Wang

University of Chicago

# This Lecture

- Recap on the economic legacies of central planning  
- Economic reform and opening up
  - Reform process  
- Reform process  
- Significant reform policies  
- Four stages of reform since 1978

# Central Planning: Departing from China's Comparative Advantage

- Heavy industries have long construction period (take longer to see returns, relative to light industries)
- But developing countries lack capital, so have higher interest rates
- The key technologies and equipment need to be imported
- But developing countries have limited foreign exchange reserves, and face expensive exchange rates (due to inability to export)
- Heavy industries require huge initial fixed capital investments
- But developing countries have dispersed agricultural production, making it difficult to raise capital (taxes)

# Short Summary: Trinity of the Traditional Economic System

- Arrangements to overcome comparative disadvantages
- Suppress interest rate well below market rate  
- Overvalue domestic currency over foreign currency  
- Ensure high profits for existing SOEs
- Trinity of the Traditional Economic System
- Distorted prices of various factors and products  
- State ownership and planned allocation  
- Powerless managers at the micro level

GDP per Capita

# Overall Evaluation of the Planned Economy

- If the only goal was to develop heavy industries, then the strategy was highly successful:
- Averaged  $6 \%$ industrial growth  
- Tested atomic bomb in 60s, and launched satellite in 70s
- But the costs were also dear for regular citizens:  $70 \%$ of the citizens remained peasants in 1978, low job creation in the cities, slow consumption growth, huge ruralurban gaps, etc.

# Economic Reform after Mao

- Market-oriented reforms require reverting many of Mao's policy agendas, which was controversial among party elites
- Hua Guofeng, Mao's designated successor: "We will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave"  
- Other party elites more inclined to admit Mao's mistakes after 1949

Deng Xiaoping, supported by Chen Yun, won the battle, and came up with the "70% right  $30 \%$ wrong" verdict on Mao

Significant because it gave reformists the room to deviate from Mao

# Reform and Opening Up

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/424cb7aca3169c0cf003113b42c45c014fe2a1122b5723537906bbdb652bc5f1.jpg)

- After Hua, Deng and his reformist allies roseto power  
3rd Plenum of the 11th Chinese Communist Party Congress, December 1978

- Emphasized the strategy of "Reform and opening up"  
- Emphasized economic development as key task

# Disagreements about Reform Plans

- Consensus: need market reform to obtain faster economic growth  
- Disagreements among party elites:
- Reformists (Deng): Market should play the central role, private incentives should be restored, central planning should be second order  
- Conservatives (Chen): "Planning as the principal, market as supplements" (bird and cage metaphor)

# Reconciling Opposing Reform Strategies

- Both teams thought market-oriented reforms were necessary, but disagreed on specific policies  
- Both sides were strong, neither could overrule the other.
- Settled on a gradual, experimental approach: try uncertain policies temporarily, partially, and locally, before implementing as national policies
- "Crossing the river by feeling the stones"  
- We will be discussing this "policy experimentation" model in greater detail in a future lecture

# Gradual Reform Strategy

- "Washington Consensus" prescribes the key steps for economic transition
- Letting the government get out of way  
- Letting the market work  
- Providing private incentives  
- Opening up to the global market
- Economists believed in the "shock therapy" reform strategy: all distortions need to be removed at once
- China, instead, followed a different, "gradual" approach

# Reform Outcomes: China vs. East Europe

- Uninterrupted growth since 1979
- Unprecedented since at least 1840

# Gradual Reform Policies

- In this lecture, we discuss some of the most significant reform policies:
- Agricultural reform: household responsibility system  
- SOE reform: township and village enterprises  
- Fiscal reform: fiscal contracting  
- Market reform: dual-track price liberalization  
- Industrial reform: special economic zones
- We will revisit these reforms next lecture to analyze their underlying economic logics

# Household Responsibility System

Agreement signed by 18  
Xiaogang villagers in December  
Villagers agreed that should anyone be imprisoned, others will help raise his children.

Bad weather in 1978, villagers worried about another famine  

- Brave villagers secretly divided commune land to each family, so that farmers can engage in private production  
- Incredible success: income grew 6 times in a year!

Heated debate among the central officials, eventually approved by Deng in late 1981.

Villages nationwide quickly adopted the new system spontaneously.

The HRS increased rural income in two important ways: By restoring private incentives, agricultural output increased. By freeing extra labor from agricultural production, boosted the development of township and village enterprises.

# Township and Village Enterprises in China

- When China first started the market reform in the early 1980s, the SOEs' share of the economy were replaced by the township and village enterprises (TVEs)  
- TVEs specialized in light industries, and played vital roles in China's economic transformation, employing 135 million workers in 1996
- Advantage over private firms: less politically controversial, better government connections (helpful since much of the economy was still under central planning)

TVEs gradually declined to become irrelevant in the 2000s

Given the reduced land per farmer (population growth and slow urbanization), de-collectivization of agriculture also freed large amounts of workers for TVEs, boosting light industrial growth.

# Fiscal Contracting Reform in 1980

# - China's fiscal reform:

- Before 1980, China had a system of "unified revenue collection and unified spending," AKA "eating from the same big pot"  
- After 1980, China gradually introduced a new system that gave local governments more authorities and incentives, AKA "eating from separate kitchens"

Under the new rule, local fiscal revenues are shared between local and central governments.

Over time, in more and more provinces, the central government takes a fixed amount, and makes the local government the residual claimant.

# Price Liberalization Reform

- The essential building block of a market system is allocating resource according to free market prices  
- But how should a planned economy liberalize its price system?
- "Shock therapy" suggests that all prices should be liberalized simultaneously in one stroke

China did something different

- Maintained the previous planned track, while introducing market system on the margin: below the quota, resources allocated by plan, above the quota, free market

# Special Economic Zones

- China needed foreign investment, technology and management to help with manufacturing growth, but political constraints made it unable to change policies and institutions nationwide
- Introduced special economic zones with preferential policies  
- Started with peripheral areas to minimize disturbance to the economy  
- Later expanded to the whole country

SEZs started with the coastal regions, later expanded to the whole country. Most prefectures have at least one SEZ today.

Becoming an SEZ leads to significant inflows of FDI.

# Lecture 7

# How Reforms Worked in China

Shaoda Wang

University of Chicago

# What is Reform?

- "Getting to Denmark": the eventual goal is less controversial (for the most part)
- Secure private property rights, rule of law, impartial enforcement of contracts, appropriate government regulations, social safety net, effective corporate governance, transparent financial system, etc.
- Reform process: look at the menu above, and try to fill in the missing pieces

# What is Reform?

- But how do we get there? Two schools of thought:
- "One Economics, many recipes" (Dani Rodrik): Human nature is the same worldwide, but specific conditions vary across settings  
- "Big bang" ("Shock Therapy": a unified package of policies that apply to all transitional economies by improving every dimension simultaneously

# Gradual Reform Strategy

- "Washington Consensus" prescribes the key steps for economic transition
- Letting the government get out of way  
- Letting the market work  
- Providing private incentives  
- Opening up to the global market
- Economists believed in the "shock therapy" reform strategy: all distortions need to be removed at once
- China, instead, followed a different, "gradual" approach

# Key Conditions for Reform to Work

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/cef32be0b48ac6f3587c4ecf75560c472c79e36f73824ac332e103af11ba8f13.jpg)

- Yingyi Qian identified two key conditions for a reform policy to work:  
- Adequate: it has to unleash enough market forces to generate sufficient economic growth compared to the status quo  
- Appropriate: it has to satisfy the existing political and economic constraints to be feasible

# Case 1: Price Liberalization Reform

- The essential building block of a market system is allocating resource according to free market prices  
- But how should a planned economy liberalize its price system? The Eastern European countries tried two different approaches:
- First tried to let the government set prices, supposedly in accordance to market demand and supply.  
- Later tried to free all prices in one stroke, and let the market determine everything

# Case 1: Price Liberalization Reform

- Neither approach worked well for Eastern Europe. But why?
- When the government sets prices, it tries to keep the SOEs afloat, so the gains from liberalization would be small. So this is "appropriate," but not "adequate."  
- When the market sets all prices at once, most of the existing SOEs fail to survive, causing instabilities. So this is "adequate," but not "appropriate."

# China's Approach: Dual-Tracked Price Liberalization

- Maintained the previous planned track, while introducing market system on the margin: below the quota, resources allocated by plan, above the quota, free market  
- Most economists did not expect this to work, and worried that the co-existence of two tracks will lead to rampant corruption:
- Connected individuals can obtain products at low prices from the planned track, and sell them at high prices in the market track

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/fcd4c4d2722099086dfef7e38e009b84bba661c46a16668aea6154ca216a79cd.jpg)  
Dual-Track Reform and Corruption

Due to the price gap between the two tracks, connected individuals can arbitrage and earn huge profits. "Arbitrager" (Dao Ye) became a trendy word at the time.

According to media reports of corruption cases, during the dual-track prices reform in the 1980s, more than  $30\%$  of China's corruption cases were related to arbitrage by bureaucrats.

# Why did Dual-Track Price Reform Work?

- It was "adequate": the introduction of market allocation increased allocative efficiency  
- It was "appropriate": the reform was a Pareto improvement (i.e., reform without losers)

# Special Case of Dual-Traceback Liberalization

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/6931897680970ff39756ee630722b41dd843679df811a6918409646ab52a6a25.jpg)

The dual-track approach is Pareto-improving.

If the initial planned allocation was efficient, then the dual-track approach is fully efficient.

# General Case of Dual-Tracker Liberalization

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/0e55a73245e151f4a027efd11f8e1596c44eeed6dd5b8423cf60527ffc3e9aa1.jpg)

When the initial planned allocation is distortive, the dual-track approach is still Pareto-improving.

Is it efficient? That depends on whether the liberalization is "limited" or "full" (i.e., whether firms can buy product to satisfy planned quota, and whether consumers can sell product assigned to them by plan)

If arbitrageurs are allowed between the two tracks, then every producer will make the right decision (produce if MC<market price, not produce otherwise); and every consumer will make the right decision (consume if MB>p, not consume otherwise). Dual track will be fully efficient, just like free market! (corruption greasing the wheel)

# Case 2: Township and Village Enterprises in China

- When China first started the market reform in the early 1980s, the SOEs' share of the economy was quickly replaced by the township and village enterprises (TVEs)  
- TVEs specialized in light industries, and played vital roles in China's economic transformation, employing 135 million workers in 1996  
TVEs gradually declined to become irrelevant in the 2000s

# TVEs vs. private firms

TVE: Alliance of entrepreneurs and T/V govt.  
What do entrepreneurs contribute?

Ideas  
Management skills  
Marketing skills

- But they had very limited access to finance, and limited connections to obtain inputs in the central planning system

# TVEs vs. private firms

What does T/V government contribute?

- Help obtain loans from rural credit cooperatives/banks  
Negotiation, collateral provision, loan guarantee  
- Help obtain productive inputs from the planner  
- Political protection and connections  
Initial capital investment

# TVEs vs. private firms

- How does T/V government benefit?

Use of after-tax profits

Retained profits earmarked for local public expenditure (40%)  
Retained profits for reinvestment (60%)

Private benefits

- Cars, banquets, cell phones, offices, etc.  
Corruption

Political benefits

Not much direct evidence, more likely to work indirectly (TVE -> GDP -> promotion)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/7521a9b33758223b78049f44bd0361f0a966bdddcc6d0c529a8be6d9d1a5fbf9.jpg)

TVEs played central roles in the 1990s, and faded away in the 2000s, as discriminations against private firms were eliminated.

# Why did TVEs work?

- TVEs suffer from many of the same issues of the SOEs, and also have vague and flawed ownership structures  
- But TVEs worked well as a reform, because they satisfied the two conditions for reforms to work:
- Adequate: TVEs provided an immediate entry into high-profit-margin businesses when the SOEs failed to deliver  
- Appropriate: There were prevalent political and economic discriminations against private firms, but TVEs, as collective firms, avoided these barriers
- As protection for private property rights improved, TVEs were replaced by private firms

# Case 3: Joint Venture Firms

- When China first tried to attract FDI, foreign investors were not allowed to have whole ownership
- Foreign ownership was politically controversial  
- Foreign capital lacks connections and would be discriminated by local governments
- Foreign capital was required to establish joint ventures with the Chinese government or SOEs
- Not ideal because this discouraged some foreign capital from investing, also creating challenges in corporate governance

# Why did Joint Venture Work?

- Joint venture equity satisfies the two conditions:
- Adequate: Foreign investors brought capital, better management practices, and more advanced technologies
- Appropriate: Local protectionism was common, foreign capital needed the support from the government, foreign ownership was also controversial
- As judicial reforms reduced discrimination against foreign firms, and foreign ownership became acceptable, joint ventures got replaced by wholly foreign owned firms

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/35c67d58-7f6d-4ca2-b1ac-07623a55eb1c/9eda927f6bee00d3ef3dfb3f40b489eca5c7c5c48a2c6d5efc220947e817891a.jpg)

In the 1990s, most FDI happened in the form of joint ventures. This form declined over time.

# Case 4: Fiscal Contracting Reform

- Local governments can be either "grabbing hand" or "helping hand," depending on their incentives  
- How to make local governments a "helping hand"? The fiscal rule dictating the relationship between local and central governments is key

# Case 4: Fiscal Contracting Reform

# - China's fiscal reform:

- Before 1980, China had a system of "unified revenue collection and unified spending," AKA "eating from the same big pot"  
- After 1980, China gradually introduced a new system that gave local governments more authorities and incentives, AKA "eating from separate kitchens"

Source: Jin, Qian, and Weingast (2001).

Under the new rule, local fiscal revenues are shared between local and central governments.

Over time, in more and more provinces, the central government takes a fixed amount, and makes the local government the residual claimant.

# Why did Fiscal Contracting Work

- The logic is very similar to the dual-track price liberalization reform:
- Adequate: by making local governments the residual claimants, marginal incentives are no longer distorted, creating local incentives to support the market economy (helping hand)  
- Appropriate: by letting the central government take a fixed amount based on grandfathering, the reform is a Pareto improvement (no losers)

# Case 5: Anonymous Banking

- A fundamental obstacle to economic development: how can governments credibly commit to not prey on private wealth (Douglas North)  
- Imagine a stylized two-stage game:
- In the  $1^{st}$  stage, the firms choose investment rate, which determines its profits in the second stage  
- In the  $2^{\text{nd}}$  stage, the government taxes the firm's revenues
- With finite horizon, the government will choose to tax at  $100\%$ , which means the firm should under-invest in the  $1^{st}$  stage

# How to Credibly Commit?

- Suppose the government is constrained by revolts: it cannot tax everyone at  $100 \%$ , but only the rich people  
- In that case, if the government doesn't possess the information of who is rich, it can credibly commit to not robbing the rich  
- This will give the rich incentives to invest

# Anonymous Banking in China

- When China expanded its financial services, it allowed households to open accounts and make deposits anonymously  
- As a result, the government cannot impose excessive taxes on the rich  
- But the government still benefits from the economic growth caused by this commitment to not over-tax:
- By suppressing the interest rate, the government implicitly taxes those with higher savings

# Why did Anonymous Banking Work

Satisfies the two conditions for reforms:

- Adequate: the credible commitment boosts investment incentives and hence business growths  
- Appropriate: the government is able to suppress interest rate, thus still benefits from the business growth

# Incomplete Reform

- We have seen that when a reform satisfies both the "adequate" and the "appropriate" conditions, it can work  
- But in a dynamic process, there is no guarantee that such reforms would eventually converge to "Denmark"…
- Example: SOE reform in China, initially worked well, but has been stuck since the early 2000s

# Case for Reform Failure: SOE Reform

Rate of return on industrial assets.

According to the logic of "adequateness" and "appropriateness," if a fundamental tension exists between growth and political constraints, then reform is more challenging.

Case in point: SOE reforms. We will discuss this in greater detail in another lecture

# Organizational Features

- Other than the two features of reform, are their underlying features that made China's transition more successful?
- Economists point to two organizational features that are conducive to reform:
- M-form vs. U-form government structure  
- Political centralization

- Under the unitary form, each ministry only cares about its own task, making it difficult to coordinate across tasks  
- Under the multi-divisional form, each province cares about all tasks within its jurisdiction, making it easier to coordinate across tasks

# Organizational Determinant of Reform Success

- The former USSR countries mostly followed the U-form structure  
- China mainly followed the M-form structure after the reform  
- Several advantages of M-form in facilitating growth (Qian, Roland, Xu):
- Easier to coordinate resources  
- Easier to conduct policy experimentation across domains  
- Performance across politicians more comparable, thus allowing political tournaments to incentivize growth

# Political Centralization and Reform (Blanchard and Shleifer)

- Throughout China's transition, the CPC maintained strong centralized power

While Economic decisions were decentralized, personnel decisions were tightly controlled by the central government

- In former USSR countries' transitions, semi-functional democratic institutions decentralized the central political power
- Local elections -> the central government could no longer appoint local politicians  
- Weak electoral accountability -> voters cannot really hold local politicians accountable

# Political Centralization and Reform (Blanchard and Shleifer)

- The difference in political centralization caused the differential effectiveness in promoting market development between Chinese and Russian local governments:
- Chinese local governments became the "helping hand" of firms  
- Former USSR local governments became the "grabbing hand" of firms

- US: bottom-up approach  
- China: top-down policy experimentation

History of policy experimentation in China  

- How does China conduct policy experimentation  
- What does (and doesn't) the Chinese government learn from policy experimentation

# Policy learning

# Policy learning as a basic task of governance

- Determining which policies to implement and how to implement them is an essential government task
- Government needs to learn about the effectiveness of a policy before it gets implemented widely
- Policy learning is challenging (in general):
- Policy effectiveness hinges on nature of the policy, its implementation details, the degree of tailoring to local conditions, and the efforts of local politicians to make the policy work

# How the US Approaches Policy learning

- Bottom-up approach: federal government collects information about policy preferences from below
- Lobbying, campaign finance, etc.  
- Commenting period on federal policies: the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 requires that new federal regulations must be publicized for 30-60 days to receive societal feedback, before regulations get finalized
- Pro: obtaining decentralized information  
- Con: policy making could be captured by powerful special interest groups

# Anecdotal evidence

- The American Association of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) initially stated that "sugary beverage/soft drink is a significant factor in tooth decay"  
- In 2005, Coca-Cola donated \$1 million to the AAPD, with no strings attached  
- The AAPD then changed its position on sugary beverage, saying that "the scientific evidence between soft drinks and tooth decay is unclear"

Notes: The dependent variable is a similarity index between the comment of firm  $f$  and the comment of grantee  $g$  in the same rule  $r$ , scaled to have a standard deviation of one. The independent variable is equal to one if grantee  $g$  received a donation from firm  $f$  in the year when the comment appears or the year before. Standard errors use two-way clustering by rule and firm-grantee pair. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

The textual similarity between firm and grantee increases after the grantee receives a donation from the firm

Notes: The dependent variables are several measures of the relationship between firm comments and the discussion of comments in subsequent rules. For columns 1-4 the outcome is the overall similarity of the text, for columns 5 and 6, the outcome is log of the number of detected occurrences of the firm's name in the discussion text, and for columns 7 and 8 the outcome is an indicator for the presence of at least one occurrence of the firm's name in the discussion text. Note that many rules do not cite commenters by name, so this is an imprecise measure of attention paid to comments. The independent variable is equal to one if there is at least one grantee  $g$  co-commenting on regulation  $r$  and receiving a grant from firm  $f$  in year  $t$  or  $t - 1$ . The asterisks (*) for Commenter Style Control in the citation columns indicates that the outcome measure is not adjusted, but the comment similarity with style control is used to find best matched rule for each comment. Standard errors use two-way clustering by rule and firm. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

When a firm's comment is accompanied by comments from its grantees, the firm's comment is more likely to influence the eventual federal policy

# Bottom-Up Policy Influences in China

- China now has more Fortune Global 500 companies than the US, how do these giant corporations affect the policy making of the Chinese govt?
- Emerging, but still much more limited in scope relative to the US, mostly due to strict government restrictions

# How China Approaches Policy Learning

Bottom-up policy learning less common in China:

- Lobbying and commenting limited in scope  
- Some evidence for revolving-door practices, but mostly about allocation (land, subsidy, etc.), not policy making

Instead, the Chinese central government directly engages in top-down policy experimentation

- From point to surface: trying out policies in a number of localities before deciding whether to roll out as national policies

# Basic Goals of Policy Experimentation

- For those policy-makers who want to push for reforms and policy changes, policy experiments address:
- Policy uncertainty: help predict policy effectiveness in a complex environment  
- Political uncertainty: help prevent potential political backlashes  
- Political disagreement: help generate consensus over policy effectiveness and policy agenda

# Basic Goals of Policy Experimentation

- Central government sets explicit overarching policy goal (what the reform intends to achieve), and key principles that mark the redlines  
- Central government agnostic to exact implementation details: experimentation allows exploration for policy tools: local trials tinker on how to achieve the policy goal  
- Central government retains rights to modify or terminate all experimentation

# Policy Experimentation in China

- The systematic policy experimentation in China since the 1980s is unparalleled in its breadth, depth and duration
- 654 large scale policy experiments in 4 decades
- Many social scientists speculate that policy experimentation played a vital role in China's reform and growth, and was a core institution that provided the adaptive capacity in a rigid political system
- How did China develop this practice? How is it implemented?
- How does it affect policy choices?

# Policy experimentation in China: historical background

# Land Reform in China

19461953.

Expropriating the land of landlords for redistribution to poor farmers.

Hugely popular among farmers, a main reason for the victory of the CPC.

# Land reform and experimentation

- One of the most demanding policy pushes, required significant state capacity to organize (which China lacked on the eve of the founding of the PRC)  
- Solution: instead of nationwide enforcement, land reform was implemented one county at a time in the early days, so all state resources could be mobilized to support implementation  
- Unintended consequence: a lot can be learned when trying out a policy in one place, gathering the experiences before moving onto the next "battlefield"

# Lack of Experimentation during Central Planning

- After 1953, with an increasingly strong central government, most new policy campaigns no longer had to go through a "gradual piloting" stage before national rollout  
- Some disastrous policy outcomes:
- Great Leap Forward  
- Cultural Revolution

# Post 1978: Experimentation as a Compromise

Conservatives and progressives disagreed on reform policies  

- Both sides were strong, neither could overrule the other  
- Returned to the gradual, experimental approach established during the land reform: try uncertain policies temporarily, partially, and locally, before implementing as national policies
- "Crossing the river by feeling the stones"

Real GDP per capita (PPP) evolution since year of price liberalization

Due to its huge success during the reform, policy experimentation got institutionalized as a systematic method for policy making

# How does the Chinese government conduct experimentation?

# Three major types of policy experimentation

# 1. Experimental regulation (Zan Xing)

- Experimental and provisional regulations

# 2. Experimental zones (Shifan Qu)

- Local jurisdiction granted with high degree of autonomy in experimentation

# 3. Experimental points (Shi Dian)

- Most common form of experimentation  
- Experimentation policy in a specific domain

# Adaptive authoritarianism: experimentation under hierarchy

If the experimentation sites experience faster economic growth during the experiment, the policy is more likely to roll out nationwide

# Trend of Experimentation

Policy experimentation initiated over time

Overall,  $45.5\%$  of the experiments turn into national policies.

Inverted-U trend seems surprising: as China grows closer to the economic frontier, new policies involve more complexity and uncertainty. Why didn't that lead to more experiments?

M-Form

To consolidate central power and reduce local influence in policy enforcement, China went through a wave of "vertical management reform" in the past two decades, which turned M-form organizations into U-form.

Organizational theories predict that U-form organizations less able to coordinate complex policy experiments.

When a ministry switches from M-form to U-form, it initiates significantly fewer policy experiments in subsequent years

# What does (and doesn't) the government learn from policy experimentation

# Leaning from Policy Experimentation

- Two characteristics of and experiment shape the information it provides regarding policy effectiveness:

-1. Representative sample selection: important when policy effects are heterogeneous;  
-2. Representative experimental situation: excessive incentives and effort allocated during exp. could exaggerate policy effectiveness

# Experimentation Accuracy in Different Stages of Reform

- Experiments have to be done in "scientific" ways in order to generate most accurate information on policy effectiveness  
- But do we always need such accuracy?
- At early stages of reform, most policies were low hanging fruits: fixing obvious distortions, generating totally inframarginal impacts. Can make right choices despite low info-noise ratio
- At reform keeps deepening, low hanging fruits are gone. New policies are uncertain, with marginal impacts. Info-noise ratio becomes critical for policy choices

# Policy Experimentation in China

- Are experimentation sites selected in a representative way?  
- Does the experimentation situation reflect the situation during national rollout of the policy?  
- Can the central government take the potential biases into account, when evaluating a policy experiment?
- If not, how does that affect policy outcomes?

# Is the selection of experimentation sites representative?

More fiscal resources being thrown in the domain during experiment, no such pattern during policy rollout

# Do the Positive Site Selection and Strategic Efforts Actually Matter?

- We have seen that policy experiments:
- Are conducted in significantly richer localities  
- Generate significant additional fiscal inputs  
- Both would likely inflate the effectiveness of the policy during the experimentation stage
- But would that affect the central government's policy choices?
- If central government can perfectly decompose region FE, politician FE, and innate policy effectiveness, these patterns wouldn't matter  
- Test: how the central government reacts to exogenous shocks unrelated to innate policy effectiveness

# Does central government account for local fiscal windfall that could benefit exp. outcomes?

- When a region experiences a land revenue windfall (driven by local terrain features and macroeconomic policies), the policy being experimented in that region is more likely to become national policy  
- Suggest mis-attribution of local fiscal capacity to innate policy effectiveness

# Among exp. that eventually become national policies …

# Taking stock

1. Experimentation sites are substantially positively selected: experimental points are much more developed than the rest of the country  
2. Unrepresentative experimental situation during experimentation: local politicians exert strategic efforts and allocate more resources that may exaggerate policy impacts  
3. Positive selection and strategic efforts not fully accounted for when evaluating experiments, biasing policy learning and national policies

# Policy experimentation in complex, political environment

- Strong bureaucracy and centralization could facilitate implementation of systematic experimentation  
- Contrast with under-experimentation under federalism  
- Misaligned incentives across political hierarchies could bias learning, inevitable in complex experimentation where bureaucracy needs to be involved  
- Trade-off: inducing efforts to improve policy outcomes, while minimizing experimenter effects that may bias learning

QIU He, a vice provincial leader of Yunnan, got arrested for corruption in 2015. Media later revealed his dramatic efforts trying to pressure the statistical officials to inflate local GDP growth data from  $8\%$  to  $12\%$ .

- In China's political tournament, local officials' promotions are linked to local GDP growth, which incentivizes over-reporting
- Several quite severe over-reporting cases got exposed ex post during the anti-corruption campaign  
- Research has shown that GDP numbers and electricity usage data deviates more in years most important for performance evaluation

# Over-Reporting by Local Officials

It is hard to deny the case that many local officials have been over-reporting local GDP data  

- But does this mean that China's national GDP data is unreliable, and China's aggregate growth heavily exaggerated?
- No. Because national GDP is NOT a summation of local GDP, instead, the central government follows an independent protocol to do its own calculation  
- National GDP usually significantly smaller than the summation of local GDP, partly due to over-reporting by local officials

# How does China Calculate its National GDP?

- All "above-scale firms" (output  $>20$ million RMB) report quarterly data directly to the National Bureau of Statistics
- Any modification of the reported data is recorded  
- Can be verified using VA-tax invoice records
- A random sample of "below-scale firms" (output < 20 million RMB) is surveyed quarterly  
- A random sample of urban households, and a random sample of rural households get surveyed monthly  
- Local survey teams are directly administered by the NBS, instead of the local governments (U-form)

- Exaggerating economic growth is universal among politicians
- White House Report of economic growth in 2021  
- Recent news on Japan "double counting" construction deals
- Hard to imagine Chinese politicians not having the same incentive
- But to what extent would this affect the overall picture?

# Could the Central Government Significantly Over-Report China's GDP?

- Unlikely, given that China's GDP number can be corroborated by export data, energy consumption data, infrastructure data, etc.
- Even if there is centralized over-reporting, the scope of this bias must be quite modest in the long run
- If China has been over-stating GDP growth by  $1.75\%$  per year, that would imply that China's GDP today is only half of its current level. Which would be at odds with most other economic indicators

# Industrial Output Growth Lower Than GDP

- Typically look at output quantity growth in some sectors, which are lower than official GDP growth. Three issues with this argument (XU Xianchun):
- The chosen sectors are typically not representative of the entire industrial structure of China (key sectors missing)  
Quantity could not properly reflect product variety (e.g., SUVs differ from normal cars)  
- Quality upgrading is not properly reflected in this calculation, which is a key component of China's growth
- Therefore, we have to use price-adjusted value added data for this exercise

# Labor Productivity Growth Seems Too High

- This approach typically compares China's labor productivity growth to that in western countries.

They ignore some key factors:

- Due to the cultural revolution, in 1982, only  $0.6\%$  of China's population was college educated. Human capital stock grew dramatically after that  
- Individual incentives were suppressed under the planned economy, and gradually got released by the reforms  
- Large scale labor reallocation from traditional sectors to IT, finance, etc.

# Was China's growth Unprecedented?

- Other Asian economies started earlier  
- Japan 1950, Taiwan 1958, South Korea 1962  
- China's growth similar to other high-performing East Asian economies

East Asia economies all slowed down when reaching \$13,500 GDP pc

- Japan 1971, Taiwan 1988, South Korea 1992  
- China (\$12551 in 2021)

# What is special about China?

- China is big
- Population close to three times the 8 high performing East Asian economies combined  
- About  $20 \%$ of the world population

Size matters

Economy of scale  

- International relations
