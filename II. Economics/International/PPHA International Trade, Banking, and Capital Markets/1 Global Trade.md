International Trade Banking and Capital Markets:

Introduction and Global Trade Overview

Dave Schabes

September 27, 2022

# International Trade and Globalization

What is globalization?  

- Why was it viewed as so successful for 50 years?  
- Why is it now viewed as flawed?  
- How will international trade and migration change in the coming years?

# Banking and International Capital Markets

- How are currencies bought and sold?  
- How do central banks manage their exchange rates?  
- Why does investment capital flow across borders?  
What are the implications of governments' actions for international capital markets?

# Logistics

# - Grading

○ Problem Sets 56%

Eight problem sets – 70 points each

$\circ$ Final Exam  $35 \%$

$\circ$  Class Participation  $9 \%$

Class attendance  

- Questions in class, during office hours or by email
- Classes held in person only

# Logistics

# - Academic Integrity

○ Problem sets – may discuss questions with other current students

- Must turn in own work  
- Do not obtain old answer sheets from Course Hero or other services  
- Do not discuss questions with students who have taken this course  
Zero on any problem set where violation of academic integrity is found

○ Final Exam – do not copy answers from other students

# Trade Terms

- Exports – what a country sells to other countries  
- Imports – what a country buys from other countries  
- Applies to both goods and services  
Trade Balance

- Surplus - exports exceed imports  
○ Deficit – imports exceed exports  
○ Balanced trade – exports equals imports

# Trade Terms

- Bilateral Trade - trade between two countries  
- Multilateral Trade – trade between a country and rest of world  
Trade policy instruments

Tariffs – taxes on imported products  

- Quotas – limits set on amount of a product imported from a country – sometimes "voluntary"  
○ Sanctions – bans importation of products from a country – e.g., Russian products banned after Ukraine invasion

# Trade Terms

- Initial models presented in course

$\circ$  Direct, bilateral exchange of finished products  
No financing available

- Subsequently discuss intermediate goods and services trade

$\circ$  Introduce multilateral trade  

- Value-added at each stage – iPhone example from text
- New methods of delivery - Offshoring

# Trade and Macroeconomics

- If you've taken introductory macroeconomics, you've seen this equation:

$$
\begin{array}{l} Y = C + I + G + E X - I M, w h e r e, \\ Y = G D P, C = C o n s u m p t i o n, I = I n v e s t m e n t, \\ G = G o v e r n m e n t S p e n d i n g, \\ E X = E x p o r t s a n d I M = I m p o r t s \\ \end{array}
$$

$EX - IM$  is known as the trade balance, if  $EX - IM < 0$  the trade balance is in deficit, if  $EX - IM >$  the trade balance is in surplus

# Determining the Trade Balance

- Rearrange the identity above, and solve for  $EX - IM$

First subtract taxes from both sides of the equation:

$$
Y - T = C + I + G - T + E X - I M
$$

from each side subtract consumption and investment,

to obtain  $(Y - T - C) - I = G - T + EX - IM,$

$Y - T$  represents disposable income and

$S_{p} = Y - T - C$  is private savings, substituting  $S_{p}$  in and moving  $G - T$  to the left hand side, we obtain

$$
(S _ {p} - I) + (T - G) = E X - I M
$$

# Interpreting the Trade Balance

- $(S_{p} - I)$  represents the difference between private savings and investment  
- $(T - G)$  equals taxes minus government spending or public investment  
- If both  $(S_{p} - I)$  and  $(T - G)$  are less than zero, then  $EX - IM < 0$ , so there must be a trade deficit  
- Text notes: "…trade balance of the economy is determined by the macroeconomic saving behavior of the households and the government." Do you agree with this interpretation?

# Global Trade

- To understand globalization we need to understand:

The incentives for countries to trade  
The barriers to trade

- Trade is thousands of years old, but:
- Has only constituted a meaningful part of national and global income in past 150 years  
○ Intermediate goods trade became significant only in past 30 years

- Tend to think of trade only increasing over time, but reality has been more complex

# World Trade Flows

- Goods trade as a percentage of global income: 1820 – 2%; 1913 – 22%; 2008 – approximately 50%  
- Why do trade flows increase over time relative to global income?

$\mathrm{O}$  A) Reductions in transportation costs  
○ B) Reductions in tariffs  
C) "Common" currency  
○ D) Convergence of income among countries

# Global Goods Trade Relative to Global Income

- Esteveadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor (2003) examine potential determinants of relative increases and decreases in global goods trade relative to global output from 1870 to 1939

$\mathrm{O}$  Study total world trade  
$\mathrm{O}$  Utilize the gravity equation  
$\mathrm{O}$  Examine potential frictions simultaneously

Attempt to determine relative impact

○ Previous studies have focused on one factor at a time

# Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor

# - Traditional Narrative

○ From 1800 to 1914 trade volume increases 20 times and approximately 10 times versus global income  
○ First Golden Age of Trade – 1870 – 1913

Acceleration in rate of growth after 1870  
Dramatic decrease in transportation costs

- Steam power mobilized
- Stable monetary environment – Gold Standard  
Tariffs low - minimal role

# Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor

Post 1914 – 1939 "bust" during interwar period

○ Traditionally attributed to increased tariffs and protectionism  
○ Little quantitative support for this explanation  

- However, transportation costs rose dramatically during this period
- Technology changes  
- Restrictive cartels and labor practices

# Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor

# Findings:

○ Model explains most of rise and fall in world trade  
Substantial portion explained by "common currency"

- Rise and fall of the gold standard

○ Tariffs small role early –important during interwar period  
○ Transport costs – fall and rise – important in rise and decline of trade  
○ Income convergence – unimportant after 1870

# Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor

- Lessons for today:

○ Transportation frictions not always decreasing  
○ Currency frictions matter substantially  

- Commercial policies important

# Shipping Rates China to US West Coast

FIGURE 1-6 Foreign-Born Migrants, 2017 (millions) This figure shows the number of foreign-born migrants living in selected countries and regions of the world for 2017 in millions of people. The level of migration is illustrated by the width of the lines, with the largest migrant numbers having the heaviest lines and the smallest having dashed lines.

Data from: OECD and UN migration data.

# Migration Terms

- Immigrants – persons entering a country from another for an extended period

$\circ$  Workers with or without family members

- Emigrants – persons leaving a country for another for an extended period  
- Refugees – persons forced to leave a country due to inability to safety

# Migration and Politics

- Increasingly offshoring substitutes for direct migration  
- European migration: East to West

○ Schengen Area – 26 countries  
○ Syrian refuge crisis  
$\mathrm{O}$  Brexit

US and Mexico

○ Maquiladoras

# Foreign Direct Investment

Vertical

○ Invest in some portion of business functions  
○ Often labor cost driven

Horizontal

O Adding complete business in another country  
○ Believe business model appeals to potential customers

- Risk management

# Models of International Trade

# Principal Models

$\circ$  Ricardian - Technology  
○ Specific Factors – Capital resources immobile  
○ Heckscher-Ohlin – Capital resources mobile (offshoring)  

- Gravity - Frictional costs (transportation, tariffs and currency stability)

# Limitations of Models

- Simplified assumptions:

One or two labor skill levels

- Distributional impacts limited or ignored

$\mathrm{O}$  No fragility

- Crop failures  
Pandemics  
Wars  
Production stoppages  
Security concerns

- All have substantial economic and political consequences
