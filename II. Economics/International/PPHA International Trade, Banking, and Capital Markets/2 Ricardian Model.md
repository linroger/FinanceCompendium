Ricardian Model

Dave Schabes

September 29, 2022

# Ricardian Model

Developed by David Ricardo in early 1800's  

- Despite the date – it's all about technology

○ Comparative Advantage  
○ Absolute Advantage

Resources

$\mathrm{O}$  Labor  
$\mathrm{O}$  Capital

# Ricardian Model

- Factors of Production

○ General term  
$\circ$  Includes:

Labor  
Equipment and Machinery  
Land  
Buildings  
Minerals

# Ricardian Model

- Previously belief was that country must hold absolute advantage to make trade worthwhile

Lowest production cost in the world  
○ Implies best technology, lowest wages, unique natural resources

- Ricardo demonstrates that only comparative advantage  
$\circ$  Required for mutually beneficial trade  
- Labor only mobile resource – capital indirectly considered

# Ricardian Model

- Ricardo's goal was to demonstrate the benefits of free trade

○ Opposed then prominent mercantilists

- Counterintuitive idea: even if cost of production for all goods a country produced higher than trading partners, still benefit by exporting the good that country produces most efficiently

# Assumptions

- Marginal Productivity of Labor (MPL) constant  
- Constant returns to scale  
- Land and capital requirements ignored  
Laborers equally skilled and available to either industry  
- Two industries, perfect competition

○ Wheat farming  
$\mathrm{O}$  Cloth production

# Example

- Two countries: Home, Foreign  
- Home labor supply  $L = 25$  
Home MPL

○ Wheat:  $\mathrm{MPL}_{\mathrm{w}} = 4$  bushels (bu)  
$\mathrm{O}$  Cloth:  $\mathrm{MPL}_{\mathrm{C}} = 2$  yards (yds)

- MPLs constant - linear Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

# Home Production Possibilities Frontier

# Home Equilibrium

# Home Equilibrium

- In autarky, Home's PPF represents income level – budget constraint  
- Home's citizens choose highest indifference curve available  
- Marginal rate of substitution equal marginal rate of transformation  
- All laborers may choose which industry to work in:

What does this say about the wage rate?  
○ What is the value of a unit of work to company?

# Home Equilibrium

$$
P _ {W} \times M P L _ {W} = P _ {C} \times M P L _ {C} = \omega ,
$$

where  $P_W$  and  $P_C$  are the prices of wheat and cloth,  $MPL_W$  and  $MPL_C$  are the marginal productivities of labor for wheat and cloth, and  $\omega$  is the wage rate

$$
R e a r r a n g i n g, w e o b t a i n \frac {P _ {W}}{P _ {C}} = \frac {M P L _ {C}}{M P L _ {W}}
$$

the relative price of two goods is inversely proportional to the relative marginal productivity of labor

# Wage Rate

- Given  $\mathrm{MPL}_{\mathrm{C}} / \mathrm{MPL}_{\mathrm{W}} = 1 / 2$  then  $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{W}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}} = 1 / 2$  
- If price of cloth is \$6 per yard, determine:

Price of wheat  
$\mathrm{O}$  Wage rate

- $1 / 2 = P_{W} / 6, P_{W} = 3$  
- $P_{W} \times M P L_{W} = P_{C} \times M P L_{C} = \omega$  
- $3 \times 4 = 6 \times 2 = 12$ , wage rate is \$12 per 4 bushels or two yards

# Introduce International Trade

- Allow Home to trade with Foreign  
- Foreign possesses inferior technology to Home

$\circ$  Foreign labor supply  $L^{*} = 100$

- Foreign MPL*

$\circ$  Wheat:  $\mathrm{MPL}_{\mathrm{w}}^{*} = 1 \mathrm{bu}$  
$\circ$  Cloth:  $\mathrm{MPL}_{\mathrm{C}}^{*} = 1 \mathrm{yd}$

# Foreign No-trade Equilibrium

# Home and Foreign Comparative Advantage

What is Foreign's opportunity cost of cloth?  
○ Of wheat?  

- What is Home's opportunity cost of cloth?  
Of wheat?

# Home and Foreign Comparative Advantage

- What is Foreign's opportunity cost of cloth? 1 bu. wheat  
Of wheat? 1 yd. cloth  
- What is Home's opportunity cost of cloth? 2 bu. wheat  
Of wheat?  $1 / 2$ yd. cloth  
- Home has comparative advantage in wheat farming  
- Foreign has comparative advantage in cloth production

# International Trade Equilibrium – Home

# Prices, Volumes and Wages

- Relative price will be determined by world demand  
- Will be at a level where both countries can consume more of one or both goods, assume  $P_{W} / P_{C} = 2 / 3$

$$
\left(\frac {P _ {W}}{P _ {C}}\right) \times \left(\frac {M P L _ {w}}{M P L _ {C}}\right) = \left(\frac {2}{3}\right) \times \left(\frac {4}{2}\right) = \left(\frac {4}{3}\right) > 1,
$$

therefore wages paid in wheat farming will exceed wages in the cloth industry

- What implications do you see for production in each country?  
- Trade will occur on the world price line (BC)

# Implications of Ricardian Model

Gains from trade for both countries  
Each country

Consumes more  
○ Specializes entirely in production of one good

Home - wheat  
Foreign - cloth

- Risk of production interruption ignored

# International Trade Equilibrium – Foreign

# More on Wages

Trade patterns determined by comparative advantage  

- Wages determined by absolute advantage  
Determine wages at Home and Foreign  
- Nominal versus real

○ Nominal in currency terms  
Real "how much can I buy?"

# More on Wages

- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{W}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}} = 2 / 3$  
Real wage determination:

○ Home

- $\mathrm{MPL}_{\mathrm{W}} = 4$  bu. of wheat  
- $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{W}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}}\right) \mathrm{XMPL}_{\mathrm{W}} = (2 / 3) \times 4 = 8 / 3$  yds. of cloth

○ Foreign

- $M P L_{C} = 1$  yd. of cloth  
- $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}}^{*} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{W}}^{*}\right) \mathrm{XMPL}_{\mathrm{C}}^{*} = (3 / 2) \times 1 = 3 / 2$  bu. of wheat

# Labor Productivity and Wages

- Productivity measured by value-added per hour  
- Greater productivity generally implies higher wages

○ Relationship varies greatly  
○ Will discuss reasons why in a couple of weeks

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/d1c69f70-6e5b-441b-bb64-b401969f2102/021dbfa597d7c51ffbc5b8c10ddf28271dbf5c9b63c2032b6861a12294b269e4.jpg)  
FIGURE 2-7 Labor Productivity and Real Wages, 2012 Labor productivity is measured by real value-added per hour of work and can be compared with the real wages paid in manufacturing in various countries. The general ranking of countries in terms of labor productivity—from highest to lowest—is the same as the ranking in terms of wages: countries with higher labor productivity generally pay higher wages, just as the Ricardian model predicts.

# Determining International Prices

- Demonstrate how the world price is determined  
Supply and demand

○ Home export supply  
○ Foreign import demand

- Construct Home export supply curve

$\mathrm{O}$  Based on relative price levels  
Why is the curve horizontal at  $12$ ?

# Home Production, Consumption and Exports

(b) Home Export Supply of Wheat

1. Home exports 0-50 bushels of wheat at a relative price of  $\frac{1}{2}$  and . .  
2… .60 bushels of wheat at a relative price of  $\frac{2}{3}$ .

# Home Export Supply and Foreign Import Demand

- Wheat production and export supply is a function of  $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{W}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}}$

○ 1/2 or lower no incentive to export

Production may occur anywhere along PPF  

- Indifferent to trade

○ 1/2 to 1 increasing exports to Foreign  
○ 1 or greater, Foreign indifferent to imports

- If  $\mathrm{P_W} / \mathrm{P_C} > 1$  or  $< 1/2$  implies one country is much larger causing the large country to be indifferent to trade

(b) Foreign Import Demand for Wheat

1. Foreign imports 0-50 bushels of wheat at a relative price of 1 and …  
2… .60 bushels of wheat at a relative price of  $\frac{2}{3}$ .

# Terms of Trade

- Refers to the price of a country's exports divided by the price of its imports

$\circ$  Rise in export prices raises terms of trade  
○ Decline in import prices raises terms of trade

- Generally, viewed as positive for country if terms of trade increase  
- Why might this be incorrect?

# Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis

- Price of primary commodities relative to manufactured goods would decline over time

$\mathrm{O}$  Generally exported from developing countries  
$\circ$  Expect terms of trade to decline over time  
$\mathrm{O}$  Reasoning:

- As wealth increases a smaller share is spent on food – increasing world income implies decreasing relative food demand  
- Substitutes increasingly found for natural minerals

# Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis

Real-world data do not show it to be a good generalization

○ Technological improvements lead to rapidly decreasing prices for manufactured goods  
$\circ$  Terms of trade for industrialized countries declines  

- Cartels, or limited locations for production, restrict supplies of some commodities  
○ Population growth and increasing wages in developing countries has increased food demand
