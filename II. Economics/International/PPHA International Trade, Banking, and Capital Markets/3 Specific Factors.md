# Specific-Factors Model

# Specific-Factors Model

- Under Ricardian model all workers gained from trade

$\bigcirc$  Earnings of other factors were not considered

- Specific (fixed) factors model examines productivity and returns of specific-factors in addition to labor

○ Specific-factors not allowed to move from sector to sector  
○ Labor still fully mobile between sectors in each country

We will see this implies diminishing marginal returns of labor as production in one sector increases  
This creates winners and losers in each country

# Output and Marginal Product of Labor

# Diminishing Marginal Productivity of Labor

- Ricardian model assumed constant marginal productivity of labor  
- Considering immobility of specific factors, marginal productivity will decrease

○ Machine shared among 11 workers versus 10  
$\mathrm{O} 100$  acres of farmland worked by three versus two tractors

# Production Possibilities Frontier

# Effect on Production Possibilities Frontier

- Ricardian model assumed constant marginal productivity of labor  
- Under Specific-factor, PPF becomes bow shaped

$\circ$  Slope at any point  $= -M P L_{A} / M P L_{M}$  
○ When moving toward increased quantities of manufactures

- $MPL_{M}$  decreases  
- $MPL_{A}$  increases

# Effect on Production Possibilities Frontier

As with the Ricardian model:

$$
W = P _ {M} \times M P L _ {M} = P _ {A} \times M P L _ {A}, r e a r r a n g i n g,
$$

$$
\frac {P _ {M}}{P _ {A}} = \frac {M P L _ {A}}{M P L _ {M}}
$$

or the relative price of manufactured goods to agricultural goods equals the opportunity cost of producing another unit of agricultural goods versus manufactured goods

# Gains from Trade

- Foreign no-trade relative price assumed to differ due to differences in:

$\mathrm{O}$  Productivity  
$\bigcirc$  Resources: labor, capital, land

- Assume Home no-trade relative price of manufactures is lower than Foreign

$$
\frac {P _ {M}}{P _ {A}} <   \frac {P _ {M} ^ {*}}{P _ {A} ^ {*}}
$$

- Home's comparative advantage in manufacturing. Foreign's in agriculture

# Increase in Relative Price of Manufactures – Home

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7aa7ffb5-968a-4df2-979a-6b91b7e9b2d2/66e2c9acd294e5c42c37901c3d63dd484ebcb66049f66619b543143a20439a30.jpg)

# Increase in Relative Price of Manufactures

- Allow for international trade between Home and Foreign

$$
\frac {P _ {M}}{P _ {A}} <   \left(\frac {P _ {M}}{P _ {A}}\right) ^ {W} <   \frac {P _ {M} ^ {*}}{P _ {A} ^ {*}}
$$

- When international trade opens, manufactures' prices will:

○ Increase relative to agricultural prices for Home  
○ Decrease relative to agricultural prices for Foreign

- Relative prices converge to the world price line

# Home Gains from Trade

Home gains from the steeper relative price curve

○ Manufacturing and agricultural quantities produced move from A to B  
$\circ$  Indifference curve from  $U_{1}$  to  $U_{2}$  
Consumption from A to C

Home overall gains from trade

○ Individual workers and industries may lose

# Home Labor Earnings

$$
\overline {{L}} = L _ {M} + L _ {A}
$$

Each industry hires until,

$$
W = P _ {M} \times M P L _ {M} a n d W = P _ {A} \times M P L _ {A},
$$

labor market equilibrium occurs when labor is allocated at point  $A$  where the two labor demand curves meet.

One can think of the demand for manufacturing labor representing the limiting factor for agricultural labor supply and vice versa

# Home Labor Earnings – Autarky

# Increase in Price of Manufactures

- Assume a relative price increase in manufactured goods,  $\Delta P_{M}$

Consider the effect on real wages, the wage rate rises from  $W$  to  $W'$  reflecting the increase,  $\Delta P_M \times MPL_M$ , equilibrium now at  $B$

$$
\Delta W = W ^ {\prime} - W <   \Delta P _ {M} \times M P L _ {M}, W h y?
$$

# Increase in Price of Manufactures-- Home

# Increase in Price of Manufactures

$$
D i v i d i n g t h r o u g h b y W = P _ {M} \times M P L _ {M},
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} o b t a i n \frac {\Delta W}{W} <   \frac {\Delta P _ {M} \times M P L _ {M}}{P _ {M} \times M P L _ {M}} = \frac {\Delta P _ {M}}{P _ {M}} \\ \frac {\Delta W}{W} i s t h e e l a s t i c i t y o f w a g e s \\ \end{array}
$$

$\frac{\Delta P_M}{P_M}$  is the elasticity of the manufactured goods price.

Real wages have fallen in terms of manufactured goods. The price of agricultural goods is unchanged, so real wages have increased versus agricultural goods

$$
0 = \frac {\Delta P _ {A}}{P _ {A}} <   \frac {\Delta W}{W} <   \frac {\Delta P _ {M}}{P _ {M}}
$$

# Earnings of Capital and Land

Zero profit, perfectly competitive firms  

- Total payments to labor are:

$$
W \times L _ {A} + W \times L _ {M}
$$

- Two methods to calculate earnings of capital and land:

$\circ$  Calculate labor payments and deduct from revenues, remainder represents earnings of capital or land  

- Multiply the good's price by the marginal productivity of capital or land

# Earnings of Capital and Land

- Calculate revenues and deduct payments to labor:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P a y m e n t s t o c a p i t a l o w n e r s = P _ {M} \times Q _ {M} - W \times L _ {M} \\ P a y m e n t s t o l a n d o w n e r s = P _ {A} \times Q _ {A} - W \times L _ {A} \\ \end{array}
$$

- Returns on capital and land are:

$$
\begin{array}{l} R _ {K} = \frac {\text {P a y m e n t s t o c a p i t a l o w n e r s}}{K} = \frac {P _ {M} \times Q _ {M} - W \times L _ {M}}{K} \\ R _ {T} = \frac {\text {P a y m e n t s t o l a n d o w n e r s}}{T} = \frac {P _ {A} \times Q _ {A} - W \times L _ {A}}{T} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Earnings of Capital and Land

- $R_{K}$  and  $R_{T}$  may be calculated based on marginal product of capital and land respectively

$$
R _ {K} = P _ {M} \times M P K _ {M}, R _ {T} = P _ {A} \times M P T _ {A}
$$

- Either method may be used depending on available data  
- $R_{K}$  and  $R_{T}$  are rental rates on capital and land respectively
- Rental is periodic return, does not matter whether capital or land is actually rented or owned  
○ If owned think of as return on investment

# Changes in Return on Capital and Land

- Change in return as relative prices change  
- Raise prices on manufactured goods, holding agricultural goods prices constant  
Result:

$\circ$  Price increase increases quantity of labor used in manufacturing  

- Raises marginal product of manufacturing specific factor  
○ Reduces marginal product of agricultural specific factor

# Changes in Return on Capital and Land

- To achieve labor market equilibrium:

$$
P _ {M} \uparrow \Rightarrow \left\{ \begin{array}{l} L _ {M} \uparrow , s o t h a t M P K _ {M} = \frac {R _ {K}}{P _ {M}} \uparrow \\ L _ {A} \downarrow , s o t h a t M P K _ {A} = \frac {R _ {T}}{P _ {A}} \downarrow \end{array} \right\}
$$

- Real rental rate in terms manufactured goods increases – percentage increase in  $R_{K}$  exceeds percentage increase in  $P_{M}$ , allowing capital owners to purchase more manufactures  
- $P_{A}$  is unchanged, so  $R_{K} / P_{A}$  also increases, allowing capital owners to purchase more agricultural goods

# Changes in Return on Capital and Land

- Owners of capital are unambiguously better off  
- Since labor leaves agriculture, real rental on land in terms agricultural goods,  $R_{T} / P_{A}$ , falls -  $R_{T}$  declines,  $P_{A}$  unchanged  
- Since  $P_{M}$  increases,  $R_{T} / P_{M}$  decreases by an even larger amount than  $R_{T} / P_{A}$ , owners of land cannot buy as many manufactured goods as well  
- Owners of land are unambiguously worse off  
- Outcome for labor is ambiguous. They will be able to purchase fewer manufacturers but more agricultural goods

# Work It Out Example (p 89)

# - Assumptions

# Manufacturing:

Sales Revenue: 150  
Labor Payments: 100  
Capital Payments: 50

# $\bigcirc$  Agriculture

Sales Revenue: 150  
Labor Payments: 50  
Capital Payments: 100

# Work It Out Example (p 89)

# - Questions:

$\circ$  Holding manufactured goods prices constant:

- Raise agricultural prices  $20 \%$  
Wages  $10 \%$

Determine impact of the agriculture price increase on the rental rate on land and on capital  

- Explain what has happened to the real rental rate on land and on capital

# Work It Out Example (p 89)

Manufacturing Revenue  $P_{M} \times Q_{M} = 150$

$\circ$  Labor Payments  $\mathrm{W} \times \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{M}} = 110$  
$\circ$  Capital Payments  $\quad R_{K} X K = 40$

- Agriculture Revenue  $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}} \times \mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{A}} = 180$

$\mathrm{O}$  Labor Payments  $\mathrm{W} \times \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{A}} = 55$  
$\circ$  Capital Payments  $\quad R_{T} X T = 125$

# Work It Out Example (p 89)

- Change in return on capital =  $\Delta R_{K} / R_{K}$

$\mathrm{O}\left(0 \% \mathrm{X} 150 - 10 \% \mathrm{X} 100\right) / 50 = -20 \%$

- Change in return on land =  $\Delta R_{T} / R_{T}$

$\mathrm{O}\left(20 \% \times 150 - 10 \% \times 50\right) / 100 = + 25 \%$

- The real rental rate on land increased  $25\%$ . Landowners gain from both the price increase and the fact that labor is a smaller factor of production, making the wage increase impact smaller. Owners of manufacturing capital lose  $20\%$  both because prices do not increase and labor is a larger factor of production.

# General Equation for Change in Factor Prices

- The following inequalities summarize the relationship among factors:

$$
F o r a n i n c r e a s e i n P _ {M}, \frac {\Delta R _ {T}}{R _ {T}} <   0 <   \frac {\Delta W}{W} <   \frac {\Delta P _ {M}}{P _ {M}} <   \frac {\Delta R _ {K}}{R _ {K}}
$$

$$
F o r a d e c r e a s e i n P _ {M}, \frac {\Delta R _ {K}}{R _ {K}} <   \frac {\Delta P _ {M}}{P _ {M}} <   \frac {\Delta W}{W} <   0 <   \frac {\Delta R _ {T}}{R _ {T}}
$$

$$
F o r a n i n c r e a s e i n P _ {A}, \frac {\Delta R _ {K}}{R _ {K}} <   0 <   \frac {\Delta W}{W} <   \frac {\Delta P _ {A}}{P _ {A}} <   \frac {\Delta R _ {T}}{R _ {T}}
$$

# Policy Application
