# Heckscher-Ohlin Theory (Factor-Proportions Theory)

- Expands on Ricardian and Specific-factors models

$\circ$  Introduces mobile capital factors of production  
$\bigcirc$  Capital factors may move to other sectors in the long-run

- Capital may be substituted for labor and labor for capital  
○ Labor competes against capital in addition to utilizing it  
- Once real-world adjustments made, fits data well

# Heckscher-Ohlin Theory

- Comparative advantage influenced by

○ Relative abundance of factors  
○ Technology choice

- Comparative advantage in these drives international trade  
- Intensity of factor use

$\bigcirc$  Focus on Labor versus Capital  
$\circ$  Control rate of MPL decline

# History of Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem

- Theory developed between 1919 and 1924  
End of long period of substantial international trade growth  
- Dramatic improvements in transportation, "mobilizing" capital goods

○ Capability to move large machines within country/internationally  
○ Evened out technology differences between countries

# Origins of Heckscher-Ohlin Model

- Debate between Heckscher and Knut Wicksell

○ Wicksell influenced by Malthus and concerns about economic equity  
○ Heckscher focused on the effects of relative abundance of factors of production

- Mass emigration from Sweden to US 1871 to 1890 due to:

○ Abundance of labor and scarcity of productive land and limited manufacturing led to  $44 \%$ population decrease

# Origins of Heckscher-Ohlin Model

- During 1918-1920 Wicksell and Heckscher corresponded on the impact of increasing wood prices on Swedish labor

○ Wicksell believed would lead to another wave of emigration

- Limited number of wealthy owners of forests who would choose to export raw lumber leading to labor emigration

Heckscher argued immigration into Sweden would follow

Real wages would fall as wood prices rose  

- Sweden equipped with scarce resource (charcoal) – globally abundant labor would immigrate

# Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions

- Two by two by two model

$\circ$  Factors:

Labor  
Capital

$\circ$  Industries:

Shoes  
Computers

Countries:

Home  
Foreign

# Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions

- Factor Endowments:

○ Home:

$$
\overline {{K}} = K _ {S} + K _ {C}
$$

$$
\overline {{L}} = L _ {S} + L _ {C}
$$

$\mathrm{O}$  Foreign:

$$
\overline {{K}} ^ {*} = K _ {S} ^ {*} + K _ {C} ^ {*}
$$

$$
\overline {{L}} ^ {*} = L _ {S} ^ {*} + L _ {C} ^ {*}
$$

- Total capital and labor are fixed within each country
- But both move freely between industries within that country

# Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions

- By assumption:
- Shoe production labor intensive – computer production capital intensive

$$
\frac {L _ {S}}{K _ {S}} > \frac {L _ {C}}{K _ {C}}
$$

○ Home is Capital abundant – Foreign is labor abundant

$$
\frac {\overline {{L}} ^ {*}}{\overline {{K}} ^ {*}} > \frac {\overline {{L}}}{\overline {{K}}}
$$

# Labor-Capital Relative Demand versus Wage/Rental

# Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions

- Only final outputs freely tradeable between countries  
○ Labor and capital cannot move between countries  
- Technologies are identical in both countries  
○ Opposite of Ricardian assumption  
- Needs to be relaxed to fit real-world data  
- Consumer tastes are identical in both countries

# No-trade Equilibria

# No-trade Equilibria

- Take PPF shape as an assumption for now – will prove later  
- Given identical tastes

○ Relative prices determine consumption in each country  
$\circ$  Relative endowments determine production quantities

- Slope of relative price curve shallower for Home  
- Computers less expensive relative to shoes  
- Relative prices would be identical if endowments identical

# Home Gains From Trade

- Home consumes at point on world relative price line where trade with Foreign is balanced

O Assured by identical tastes at Home and Foreign  
$\circ$  At point C, Home:

- Exports  $Q_{C2} - Q_{C3}$  computers  
- Imports  $Q_{S3} - Q_{S2}$  shoes
- The relative price of computers increases from:

$$
\left(\frac {P _ {C}}{P _ {S}}\right) ^ {A} \mathsf {t o} \left(\frac {P _ {C}}{P _ {S}}\right) ^ {W}
$$

# Foreign Gains From Trade

- Foreign consumes at point on world relative price line where trade with Home is balanced

O Assured by identical tastes at Home and Foreign  
$\circ$  At point  $C^{*}$ , Foreign:

- Imports  $Q_{C3}^{*} - Q_{C2}^{*}$  computers  
- Exports  $Q_{S2}^{*} - Q_{S3}^{*}$  shoes
- The relative price of computers decreases from:

$$
\left(\frac {P _ {C}}{P _ {S}}\right) ^ {A ^ {*}} \mathsf {t o} \left(\frac {P _ {C}}{P _ {S}}\right) ^ {W}

# World Equilibrium

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/8417fcce-3cdd-43a8-9acf-074645c5cb2d/f7f04e56800764d34f78363ebeb4c5c91fd4852da3310fc5f788c792dbdbb7d9.jpg)

# World Equilibrium

- Reach equilibrium when:

○ Relative price of computers Home exports reaches the relative price where Foreign is willing it import such that,

$$
Q _ {C 2} - Q _ {C 3} = Q _ {C 3} ^ {*} - Q _ {C 2} ^ {*}
$$

Free-trade equilibrium

- Since no borrowing or lending is allowed, therefore,

$$
Q _ {S 2} ^ {*} - Q _ {S 3} ^ {*} = Q _ {S 3} - Q _ {S 2}
$$

# Pattern of Trade

- Given restrictive assumptions:

○ Relative factor endowments determine the pattern of trade between Home and Foreign  
○ Each country exports the abundant factor available in its economy

Home - capital  
Foreign - labor

- These are the fundamental insights of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem

# Real-world Analysis – Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions

- Labor and capital flow freely between industries  
- Production of one good labor intensive; other capital intensive  
- One country labor abundant; other capital abundant  
- Free trade in international goods  
- Technologies identical across countries  
- Identical tastes across countries  
- No borrowing or lending allowed

# Leontief Paradox (1953)

- Leontief's study of post WWII American exports and imports  
- Despite substantial comparative advantage in terms of capital

○ US exported products with a significant labor component

- Capital to labor ratio lower for US exports than US imports in 1947 – assumed foreign firms used US technology  
○ Contradicted predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model

# Leontief's Findings<sup>1</sup>

<table><tr><td></td><td>Exports</td><td>Imports</td></tr><tr><td>Capital ($ millions)</td><td>2.55</td><td>3.1</td></tr><tr><td>Labor (person-years)</td><td>182</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>Capital/labor ($/person)</td><td>14,000</td><td>18,200</td></tr></table>

Data from: Wassily Leontief, 1953, "Domestic Production and Foreign Trade: The American Capital Position Re-examined," Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 97, September, 332-349. Reprinted in Richard Caves and Harry G. Johnson, eds., 1968, Readings in International Economics (Homewood, IL: Irwin).

US exported labor and imported capital  
US exports substantially exceeded imports during this period

# Potential Explanations for the Leontief Paradox

- US technologies and those of foreign importers differ  
- Leontief ignores abundance of land as a factor of production  
- No distinction between

○ High-skilled and low-skilled labor  
○ US exporting highly skilled labor?

Distortions due to 1947 – two years after the end of WWII  
US not actively engaged in free trade

# Leamer (1980) Reformulation of Leontief Test²

- Leamer used an extension of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem developed by Jaroslav Vanek (known as HOV)  
HOV states the following:

○ If a country's endowment of a factor relative to the world endowment of that factor exceeds the country's share of world GDP, the country is abundant in that factor

- Relies on the assumptions that all tastes are identical and homothetic which implies that relative consumption is proportional to GDP

# Leamer (1980) Reformulation of Leontief Test<sup>3</sup>

- Leamer demonstrated that HOV implied, if country  $i$  were capital abundant, for example, the production capital/labor ratio exceeded that for consumption:

$$
\frac {K ^ {i}}{L ^ {i}} > \frac {K ^ {i} - F _ {k} ^ {i}}{L ^ {i} - F _ {l} ^ {i}},
$$

where  $F_{k}^{i}$  and  $F_{l}^{i}$  are the factor contents of trade

<table><tr><td></td><td>Economy-wide Production</td><td>Domestic Consumption</td></tr><tr><td>Capital ($Billions)</td><td>$327</td><td>$305</td></tr><tr><td>Labor (Person-years)</td><td>47 million</td><td>45 million</td></tr><tr><td>Capital/Labor ($/person)</td><td>$6,949</td><td>$6,737</td></tr></table>

# Bowen, Leamer and Sveikauskas (1987)

- Replicated Leamer (1980) methodology on 27 countries

○ H-O hypothesis describes "relation among three separately observable phenomena":

Trade  
Factor input requirements  
Factor endowments

- Again looked at Trade = Production less Consumption

$$
\frac {K ^ {i}}{L ^ {i}} > \frac {K ^ {i} - F _ {k} ^ {i}}{L ^ {i} - F _ {l} ^ {i}}
$$

- Statistically insignificant regarding Leontief's prediction — missing element: factor-price equalization

# Factor Endowments 2017

- Unadjusted for:

GDP  
$\mathrm{O}$  Qualitative differences

- Labor skill/productivity differences  
Arable land productivity

- Leads to "effective" factor endowment  
$\circ$  Accounts for productivity differences  
- Consider endowment as share of GDP – domestic absorption

# Effective Factor Endowments 2017

- Effective factor endowment:

$\circ =$  actual factor endowment X measure of productivity  
○ May be direct or indirect, e.g., capital spending per person

- Comparing effective factor endowment to global GDP share determines

○ Whether the effective factor endowment is scarce or abundant

- Many more adjustments required to fit real world
