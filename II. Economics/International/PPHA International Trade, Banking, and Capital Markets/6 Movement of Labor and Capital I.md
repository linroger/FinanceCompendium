# Movement of Labor and Capital Between

# Countries I

Dave Schabes

October 13, 2022

# Migration and Capital Investment

- Begin with Specific Factors model – short-run consequences  
- Subsequently Heckscher-Ohlin model – long-run consequences  
- Impact on wages  
- Turn to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

Capital movement across countries

Gains and losses due to migration and FDI

# Short-run Effects

- Two sectors Manufacturing and Agriculture  
- Single labor pool:

$$
L_{A} + L_{M} = \overline {{L}}
$$

Wages in each sector:

$$
W = P_{A} \cdot M P L_{A}
$$

$$
W = P_{M} \cdot M P L_{M}
$$

- Equilibrium occurs when  $W$  is the same in both sectors

# No-trade Home Market Labor Equilibrium

# Introduce Foreign Country – Short Term Model

- Foreign wage is  $W^{*} < W$  
- Assume Home allows immigration of workers from Foreign  
- Labor force increases:

$\bar{L}^{\prime} = \bar{L} + \Delta L$ , where  $\Delta L$  is the number of immigrant laborers

- This shifts the  $P_{A} \cdot MPL_{A}$  curve to the right resulting in a new, lower equilibrium wage rate,  $W'$  
- Equilibrium moves from point A to B

# Increase in Home Labor due to Immigration

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/11fe0b74-1763-4c5e-aae4-ab9bd5885d53/e12703d94102b44a8c71edd4337d8832d1cc2350226d033c34bae314018dc0c6.jpg)

# Short-term Outcomes

- Labor usage increases in both sectors  
Wages decline for all workers  
- Views of capital-owners versus domestic unions  
- Short-run both industries' output rises

$\circ$  Labor increase does not affect world relative prices

# New World Immigration and Wage Convergence

- Increased number of workers in New World lower  $M P L_{L}^{N W}$  
- Decreased number of workers in Europe raise  $MPL_{L}^{EU}$

# Shift in Production Possibilities Frontier

Output of agriculture,  $Q_{A}$

# Long-run Effects of Immigration

- Assume Heckscher-Ohlin world, except:

○ Allow labor to move between countries  
Capital remains fixed in each country  

- Shoe manufacturing labor intensive; computer manufacturing capital intensive

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac{L_{S}}{K_{S}} > \frac{L_{C}}{K_{C}} e q u i v a l e n t l y, \frac{K_{C}}{L_{C}} > \frac{K_{S}}{L_{S}} \\ K_{C} + K_{S} = \overline {{K}} a n d L_{C} + L_{S} = \overline {{L}} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Long-run Effects of Immigration

# - Box diagram

○ Shows allocation of labor and capital by industry  
$\circ$  Axes rotated  $180^{\circ}$  for one sector to create box  
○  $0_{5} \mathrm{~A}$  allocation of capital and labor to shoe industry  
○  $0_{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{A}$  allocation to computer industry

Less capital per worker in shoe industry,  $\frac{0_C K}{0_C L} > \frac{0_S K}{0_S L}$

# Labor Increase at Home Impact on Wages, Rentals and Output

Real wage and rental rate determined by marginal products

○ Home's higher K/L implies lower MPK and rental rate and greater MPL and wage rate compared with Foreign

- Add immigrant labor to the Home economy,  $\overline{L}^{\prime} = \overline{L} +\Delta L$

$\mathrm{O}$  Lengthens the labor axis by  $\Delta L$  
○ Labor is not allocated to both sectors as it was with specific-factors model

# Labor Increase at Home Impact on Wages, Rentals and Output

- Outputs adjust to allocate incremental labor to labor intensive industry (shoes)

$\bigcirc$  Capital-labor ratios constant  
○ Labor and capital leave computer industry

- Workers – same amount of capital as prior to immigration

○ Additional labor fully employed  
$\circ$  Capital-labor ratios unchanged in each industry

# Labor Increase at Home Impact on Wages, Rentals and Output

- w/r remains the same  
○ No change in marginal productivities – unlike short-term  
- Factors of production available increase for shoes – decrease for computers  
- Shoe output increases  
○ Computer output decreases  
- Relative prices remain constant

# Rybczynski Theorem

- In the long-run, an increase in one factor results in the country increasing output in the industry using that factor intensively and decreasing output of the other industry

○ Under assumptions of Heckscher-Ohlin model  

- Holds for any factor
- Results in Factor Price Insensitivity theorem

○ Factor prices unchanged as economy shifts output to industry utilizing increased factor intensively

# Rybczynski Theorem – Home Viewpoint

# Mariel Boat Lift – 1980

- Brought low-skilled Cuban refugees to Miami  
- 125,000 immigrants came from May through September 1980
- Increased labor force  $7 \%$ ;  $50 \%$ settled permanently  
$\circ$  Represented larger impact on low-skilled labor market

David Card (1990) study – natural experiment

○ No long-term impact on wages in the region  
○ No discernible impact on unemployment rate

# Mariel Boat Lift Impact

- Rybczynski theorem predicts that in the Miami area:

Low-skill labor industries will expand  
○ High-skill labor industries will contract

Real value-added in apparel industry increases after lift - remains above trend in Miami for well over a decade after the Miami boat lift  
Real value-added by skilled workers in skill intensive industries declines after lift and remains below trend

# Valueadded by Worker Type

(a) Apparel Industry

(b) High-Skilled Industries

# Mariel Boat Lift Impact

- Competing hypothesis for no relative decline in low-skill wages

○ "Skill-based technological change"

- Computers adopted more slowly in Miami than US overall

Firms may have employed low-skill workers longer in place of computers

○ Only  $20 \%$ of Mariel immigrants in manufacturing

- Skill-based technology change inconclusive here

# Immigration and US Wages

- The number of foreign-born people doubled in the US between 1980 and 2005 to  $13\%$  
- Relative impact on wages a function of

○ Whether the immigrants were competitive with or complementary to domestic workers  
○ There was a change in availability of capital in a given industry or position

- Competition appears greatest at lowest end of educational spectrum

# Education of Foreign-born Workers in US (2017)

- The number of migrants from Mexico has declined as conditions in Mexico improved and in the US declined

# US Refugee Asylum Applications (Thousands)

- Migrants from other Central American countries have increased often migrating through Mexico

Notes: 1. Short-run model fixes capital and land  
2. Long-run model allows for capital to adjust

# Immigration and Wages

# Part A:

Long-run adjustments maintain:

Capital/labor ratio  
Real wage to rental ratio

$\circ$  Assumes US and foreign workers are perfect substitutes

# Part B:

$\circ$  Assumes foreign workers are imperfect substitutes  

- Principally compete with other foreign workers

# Impact of Immigration and Wages on Output

- Short-run, both industries:

$\circ$  Employ more workers relative to capital  
$\bigcirc$  Increase output

- Specific-factors model applies

# Impact of Immigration and Wages on Output

- Long-run, both industries

○ Maintain previous L/K  
Output of one industry increases  
Output of second industry decreases

HOV model applies

# Foreign Direct Investment

- Two types:
- Horizontal – purchase of a company in one country by a company based in another  
Vertical – creation or purchase of a plant or other capabilities in one country by a company based in another

- Greenfield versus Brownfield – new versus existing  
- Represents an increase in capital in the country receiving FDI  
Traditionally from high-wage to low-wage countries
