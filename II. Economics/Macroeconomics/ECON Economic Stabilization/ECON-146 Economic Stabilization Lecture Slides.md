# Module 2

Second set of slides

# Monetary policy and aggregate demand:

Traditionally the Fed has changed interest rates (its policy rate which in turn affects other interest rates) to affect aggregate demand.

For example, to stimulate the economy the Fed lowers interest rates, except when interest rates are zero.

The so-called traditional channels of influence of monetary policy are:

i. lower rates boost consumption by lowering the cost of borrowing, by increasing the value of household wealth, and reducing the incentive to save (that is assumed to exceed the target wealth effect)  
ii. lower rates (e.g., lower corporate bond rates and lower mortgage rates) boost investment by lowering the cost of borrowing for businesses and for residential construction  
iii. lower domestic interest rates (relative to those abroad) reduce the exchange value of the dollar and hence boost net exports

# Equilibrium in the market for new goods and services: the IS relation

Start with the familiar expression for goods market equilibrium:

$$
Y = C + I + G + N X \quad w h e r e N X = X - M
$$

Thus,  $\mathrm{Y} - \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{G} - \mathrm{NX} + \mathrm{T} - \mathrm{T} = \mathrm{I}$ . This implies:  $(\mathrm{Y} - \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{T}) + (\mathrm{T} - \mathrm{G}) - \mathrm{NX} = \mathrm{I}$ . Now observe that:

$$
\begin{array}{l} Y - C - T = \text{Sh h} + \text{Sb us} (\text{ho us ho ld pl us bu si ns sa vi ng}) \\ \mathrm{T} - \mathrm{G} = \text{Sg ov (go ve nn me nt sa vi ng)} \\ - \mathrm{NX} = \text{Sf or (fo rg in es av in g)} \\ \end{array}
$$

[Note on foreign saving: -NX = M - X = C + I + G - Y. In economic terms, if the U.S. is importing more than it is exporting, it must be that in the U.S. total expenditures on domestically produced plus foreign produced goods (C + I + G) must exceed domestic income (Y). [Recall that Y denotes gross output of domestically produced goods which must equal gross domestic income.] Because U.S. expenditures exceed U.S. income, the U.S. must be borrowing from the rest of the world in order to finance the excess. This means that foreigners are acquiring U.S. IOUs, i.e., foreigners are saving in this form.]

Let total saving  $= \mathrm{S} = \mathrm{Shh} + \mathrm{Sbus} + \mathrm{Sgov} + \mathrm{Sfor}$

# Thus goods market equilibrium is defined by  $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{I}$

This is why textbooks (and us) focus on the  $\mathrm{I} = \mathrm{S}$  or IS relationship/curve as we will see below. It could just as well be called the  $\mathrm{Y} = \mathrm{C} + \mathrm{I} + \mathrm{G} + \mathrm{NX}$  curve.

In math terms, goods market equilibrium is given by:

1. $\mathrm{Y} = \mathrm{C} + \mathrm{I} + \mathrm{G} + \mathrm{X} - \mathrm{M}$
2. $C = C0 + cy(Y - T) + cye(Y - T)e - cr$  
3. $\mathrm{I} = \mathrm{IO} + \mathrm{i}\mathrm{y}\mathrm{Y} + \mathrm{i}\mathrm{ye}\mathrm{Ye} - \mathrm{i}\mathrm{r}$  
4. $\mathrm{NX} = \mathrm{N0}$  - ny Y - nyeYe - ne e
5. $\mathrm{e} = \mathrm{e}0 + \mathrm{er}(\mathrm{r} - \mathrm{rf})$

All coefficients are taken as a positive constant. Examples:

$\mathrm{cy} = \mathrm{dC} / \mathrm{d(Y -T)} =$  marginal propensity to consume out of current real disposable income;

$\mathrm{iy} = \mathrm{dI} / \mathrm{dY} =$  marginal propensity to invest out of current output.

The intercept terms also have interpretations.

1. C0 is assumed to capture exogenous consumption-related variables such as the price of housing and consumer confidence and people being ordered to stay home (during the corona-virus outbreak).  
2. I0 is assumed to capture exogenous investment-related variables such as business optimism/pessimism, sometimes referred to as "animal spirits."

By substituting equations 2 - 5 into equation 1 and solving the result for  $\mathbf{r}$  as a function of  $\mathrm{Y}$ , we get the following:

Equation defining the IS curve (see appendix 1 for math details):

$$
r = \text{(me ss yn eg at iv es lo pe co ef fi ci en t)Y} + \text{(me ss yi nc te rp te rm)}
$$

Conclusion: higher domestic real interest rates reduce aggregate demand; the downward sloping curve in (Y, r) space that captures all combinations of real interest rates and GDP consistent with equilibrium in the market for new goods and services is called the IS curve.

# Here is the reason that the curve is downward sloping:

---because  $\mathrm{Y} = \mathrm{C} + \mathrm{I} + \mathrm{G} + \mathrm{NX}$ , an increase in  $\mathrm{Y}$  must be accompanied by an increase in  $\mathrm{C} + \mathrm{I} + \mathrm{G} + \mathrm{NX}$  which requires a lower real interest rate (which boosts C, I, and NX through the "traditional" channels of influence).

The IS curve shifts to the right (or upward) with several exogenous factors captured in the "messy" intercept term:

i. increase in G (which is a direct boost to aggregate demand)  
ii. improved consumer or business confidence (i.e., an increase in C0 or I0)  
iii. increase in the exogenous price of housing and hence household wealth (captured as an increase in C0)  
iv. increased foreign demand for U.S. goods (captured as an exogenous increase in exports)  
v. increase in the real foreign interest rate, rF, which causes the dollar to depreciate and net exports to rise.  
vi. A tax cut which boosts current disposable income and consumption.

(some economists argue the effect is actually zero to the extent that the effect on current disposable income is exactly offset by a reduction in future disposable income that would arise if the current tax cut is eventually financed by a future tax increase.)

# Monetary Policy Rule

$$
\mathrm{r} = \mathrm{M} (\pi - \pi^{*}, \mathrm{Y} - \mathrm{Yp}) = \mathrm{r}^{*} + \mathrm{r} \pi (\pi - \pi^{*}) + \mathrm{r} \mathrm{y} (\mathrm{Y} - \mathrm{Yp})
$$

1. The Fed is assumed to raise real interest rates when price inflation on goods and services,  $\pi$ , rises relative to its target,  $\pi^{*}$ , and when the output gap (difference between actual and potential GDP) rises. This is called "leansing-against-the-wind" policy.  
2. I have linearized the Fed's policy response function, M, after the second equals sign; in this expression,  $\mathbf{r}^*$  is exogenous, although it depends on a host of factors in more complicated formulations.  
3. Also  $r\pi$  and  $r\mathbf{y}$  are positive constants. For example,  $\mathrm{ry} = \mathrm{dr} / \mathrm{d}(\mathrm{Y} - \mathrm{Yp})$  and is interpreted as the impact of a change in the output gap on the real interest rate. Also, all variables are taken as of time  $t$  (today) but for simplicity I have not included time subscripts.  
4. This Fed "rule" has very roughly been in effect for a long time, arguably since the 1970s. The Fed doesn't follow it exactly but it provides a reasonable guide to Fed actions.

the rule is deceptively simple, masking a host of important issues, including the following:

a. for stability, Fed must target the real interest rate-- if  $\pi$  rises and i go up, but less than point-for-point, the real interest rate falls and aggregate demand rises and hence  $\pi$  rises even more, leading to unstable dynamics. For stable dynamics, it must be that  $\mathrm{di} / \mathrm{d}\pi > 1$ . This is sometimes called the Taylor Principle (after economist, John Taylor).  
b. implementation is difficult because we don't observe potential GDP and because there are several empirical measures of inflation (including the CPI). With regards to inflation, the Fed has to choose between total or headline inflation and core inflation (core inflation removes food and energy inflation from the total).  
c. Asset price inflation (such as the price of homes) is not included directly, only indirectly to the extent that it affects overall consumer price inflation  $(\pi)$  or real GDP

d. For a long time, policymakers took zero as the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, implying a limit to stimulative monetary policy.

i. the Fed acted as if zero was the lower bound for short-term nominal interest rates, especially the federal funds rate (the funds rate was zero between late 2008 and late 2015 and again in early 2020).

ii. During the financial crisis, it was thought that the Fed was out of traditional ammunition to fight recessions and in response the Fed took several innovative measures to get around the issue of the zero lower bound for the funds rate. It has taken similar measures during the COVID pandemic.

----This included three rounds of quantitative easing, the massive purchase of both short-term and long-term Treasury and private securities.

----The intent was to lower long-term interest rates (which had remained positive) because long-term rates generally are more closely related to the components of aggregate demand than short rates.

---The Fed also introduced "credit easing" which made liquidity available to certain select markets (such as the market for commercial paper) to prevent such markets from shutting down necessary credit flows. In 2020, the Fed again is using these modern tools to limit the decline in the economy resulting from the corona-virus.

a. The Fed could focus on expected inflation,  $\pi e$ , and on expected output, Ye, instead of current values. This would account for the empirical fact that Fed actions take time in the real world before they are felt by the economy. Perhaps surprisingly such a modification does not affect the qualitative results below very much (this is a homework problem).

b. In (Y,r) space, the curve relating all values of r and y consistent with the monetary policy rule is called the MP line. It is horizontal if r depends only on  $\pi$ ; it is upward sloping if r depends on y.

---slope: The idea is that if y falls (rises) the Fed leans against the wind by reducing (increasing) the real interest rate.

---shifts:

a. the MP curve shifts up with higher inflation: the idea is that, for a given  $y$ , higher inflation causes the Fed to boost the real interest rate to fight the higher inflation.

b. The curve shifts up (down) if the target rate of inflation falls (rises).

**To simplify the analytics for the remainder of this module, we will ignore the impact of the output gap on interest-rate setting by the Fed and thus consider only the case where the MP line is flat, shifting up or down with inflation; we set  $ry$  equal to zero.**

# Aggregate Demand: IS-MP in  $(\mathrm{Y},\pi)$  space [see appendix for formal math]

AD equation:  $\pi =$  messy intercept term  $^+$  (messy negative slope coefficient)Y

1. The curve relating all values of  $Y$  and  $\pi$  consistent with goods market equilibrium subject to the Fed's policy response function is called the AD curve;
2. Negative Slope: As  $\pi$  rises,  $\mathbf{r}$  rises because of the Fed response; this leads to a reduction in the interest-rate-sensitive components of aggregate demand and hence total aggregate demand (Y). [see figure on next slide]
3. AD Curve shifts (intercept term): The curve shifts right or upward with  
i. higher values of current G ---IS shifts right [see figure on next slide]  
ii. improved consumer/business confidence (higher C0 or I0)--IS shifts right  
iii. Higher real foreign interest rate---IS shifts right  
iv. lower taxes ---IS shifts right  
v. Higher expected future income---IS shift right  
vi. higher value of the Fed's target rate of inflation  $(\pi^{*})$  MP shifts down  
vii. Lower value of  $r^*$  (MP shifts down)

# Module 2

Third set of slides

Modeling the supply side of the macro economy is more controversial than the demand side.

This is because of the debate over the degree of inertia or stickiness of wages and prices and price expectations in the short run.

i) In the classical approach wages and prices are flexible even in the short run so that the economy (in particular, the labor market) is always in equilibrium with fully employed resources; this implies that output always equals its natural value.  
ii) In Keynesian-style approaches, stickiness of wages/prices/price expectations allows for unemployment and output to not always equal their "natural" levels.

# Wage setting:

**Wages are determined as the result of bargaining between workers and firms. Participants have bargaining power that depends on:

i. conditions in the overall labor market (including competition from foreign labor), such as the level of the unemployment rate. For example, a higher unemployment rate likely would weaken the bargaining power of workers and hence reduce the nominal wage rate, assuming that the wage rate is flexible in the downward direction.  
ii. how costly it would be for firms to replace workers. As such costs rise, workers have stronger bargaining power (z increases); think about labor market shortages in 2021-22.  
iii. The level of unemployment insurance benefits—higher benefits likely would improve the bargaining power of workers and boost wages (z increases).  
iv. expected prices and productivity gains (Pe and Ae) --these matter because workers care about how much inflation will erode their nominal wages and how productivity gains will be divided between firms and workers.

This discussion is captured by the following equation:

$\mathbf{W} = \mathrm{AePe}$  f(u, z) where  $\mathrm{df /du <0}$ . Simplify by linearizing the f.) function as follows:  $\mathrm{f(.) =1 -a u +z},$  and thus we get:  $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{AePe}$ $(1 - a u + z)$

Here, W denotes the nominal wage rate; Pe denotes the expected price level; u denotes the unemployment rate; Ae is the expected level of a measure of labor productivity (discussed in more detail below); z denotes other labor-market factors, like the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits, the level of the minimum wage, and the degree of employment protection.

We define the unemployment rate as  $\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{1} - \mathbf{N} / \mathbf{L}$ , where  $\mathbf{N}$  is employment and  $\mathbf{L}$  is the size of the labor force (assumed exogenous). We define  $z$  in such a way that  $\mathrm{df} / \mathrm{dz} > 0$ ;  $\alpha$  is a positive constant.

# Price setting by firms:

**The price, P, set by a firm depends on the costs it faces in producing output and on the degree of competition it faces. In particular, higher costs get passed through into higher prices and less competition results in higher prices.

Costs depend on the nature of the production function and on the prices of factor inputs.

i. The production function is given by  $\mathrm{Y} = \mathrm{A}\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{N},\mathrm{K})$ , where  $\mathrm{dY /dN} = \mathrm{AdF /dN} > 0$  and  $\mathrm{d2Y /dN2} < 0$ . The latter inequality is the assumption of diminishing marginal productivity of labor.  
ii. "K" denotes the services of the stock of physical capital, which is assumed fixed at K0 in short-run analysis.  
iii. To simplify, labor and physical capital are the only two factors of production, with energy inputs being ignored at this point.  
iv. "A" is a measure of the level of technology and changes in it are termed "productivity shocks" in part because the marginal product of labor is  $\mathrm{dY} / \mathrm{dN} = \mathrm{AF}(\mathrm{N},\mathrm{K0})$  which obviously depends on "A".

Total production cost is  $\mathrm{WN} = \mathrm{Cost}$  (we ignore capital and other costs which are assumed constant in our short run analysis)

--- the marginal cost of production is  $\mathrm{dCost} / \mathrm{dY} = \mathrm{W}(\mathrm{dN} / \mathrm{dY}) = \mathrm{W} / (\mathrm{dY} / \mathrm{dN}) = \mathrm{W} / \mathrm{AF}'(\mathrm{N},\mathrm{K0})$  for a given nominal wage rate.  
---The marginal cost of producing another unit of output depends on how many additional labor hours are needed (dN/dY) and on the wage rate of labor  $(= W)$ .

If there was perfect competition in the goods market, the price of output would be equal to the marginal cost of production.

Blanchard simplifies by assuming constant returns to labor in production, i.e.,  $\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{N}) = \mathrm{NK0}$ .

Thus,  $\mathrm{Y} = \mathrm{AF}(\mathrm{N},\mathrm{K0}) = \mathrm{ANK0}$

i. unit labor costs are defined as WN/Y, which equals W/AK0 in Blanchard's model. ii.  
The simplification implies that the marginal product of labor is a constant, "AK0," and that the unemployment rate,  $\mathrm{u} = 1 - \mathrm{N} / \mathrm{L} = 1 - \mathrm{Y} / \mathrm{AK0L}$ .  
iii. Without further loss of generality Blanchard assumes  $\mathrm{A} = 1$  (and we will also assume  $\mathrm{K0} = 1$ ), so that  $\mathrm{Y} = \mathrm{N}$ . This implies that  $\mathrm{dY /dN} = \mathrm{AF'(N)} = 1$  since both  $\mathrm{A}$  and  $\mathrm{F'(N)}$  equal 1.  
iv. thus the marginal cost of production  $= \mathrm{W} / \mathrm{AF}'(\mathrm{N},\mathrm{K0})$  reduces to W, the wage rate that the firm is facing.

Thus the competitive firm would set  $P = W$ ; if  $A$  and  $K0$  do not equal 1 the firm would set  $P = W / AK0$ .

However, many goods markets are not competitive, and firms charge a price in excess of marginal cost. That is,  $P = (1 + m)W / AK0$ ,

---m denotes the percentage "markup" of prices over (unit labor) cost.  $\mathrm{m} = 0$  under perfect competition and  $\mathrm{m} > 0$  when output markets are non-competitive

This equation implies that  $\mathrm{W /P =AK0 / (1 +m)}$ . Thus, the real wage,  $W / P$ , is constant unless the markup, technology or fixed capital stock changes. This implies a plot of the real wage against the unemployment rate would be a horizontal line (which shifts with  $A$ ,  $m$ , etc.).

If  $\mathrm{A} = \mathrm{K}0 = 1$ , then the equation simplifies to:  $\mathrm{W /P} = 1 / (1 + \mathrm{m})$ .

Combining Wage Setting and Price Setting: Aggregate Supply

Combining the above key equations, with A and K0 not equal to 1, we get:

$$
P = (1 + m) W / A K 0 = (1 + m) (A e / A K 0) P e (1 - a u + z) \quad \text{wh er e} u = 1 - Y / A K 0 L
$$

$$
\mathrm{P} = (1 + \mathrm{m}) (\mathrm{Ae} / \mathrm{AK 0}) \mathrm{Pe} [ 1 + \mathrm{z} - \alpha + \alpha \mathrm{Y} / \mathrm{AK 0L} ]
$$

1. Thus an increase in output leads to an increase in the price level and is called an aggregate supply relationship (between output and the price level--below we develop another aggregate supply relationship that connects output to the rate of price inflation).

****The underlying rationale is that higher output requires more labor input (for a given level of A and K0); more employment implies a lower unemployment rate; a lower level of the unemployment rate puts upward pressure on wages, W; and higher wages lead firms to increase prices.*****

2. An increase in the expected price level or expected level of labor productivity leads to a proportionate increase in the price level.

If wage setters expect a higher price level (or their productivity to be higher), they bargain for a higher nominal wage; the higher wage is an increase in production costs that leads firms to boosts output prices.

3. To simplify the analysis until later in the module, I will assume  $\mathrm{A} = \mathrm{Ae} = \mathrm{K0} = 1$ .
